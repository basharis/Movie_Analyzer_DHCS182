1
00:01:25,332 --> 00:01:28,631
New Delhi's National Sports stadium..
The stadium is filled to the brim.

2
00:01:30,504 --> 00:01:35,441
Only 2 minutes left in the
World Men's Hockey Championship..

3
00:01:35,609 --> 00:01:37,804
lndia is one goal behind Pakistan.

4
00:01:37,878 --> 00:01:38,936
Vijay, pass it here!

5
00:01:39,012 --> 00:01:43,449
lndian Captain Kabir Khan, Asia's
best center forward pushing his team

6
00:01:44,551 --> 00:01:46,644
Come on! Come on!

7
00:01:50,724 --> 00:01:52,487
Suspense in the audience.

8
00:01:53,693 --> 00:01:58,630
Tension on the faces
of the officials..

9
00:01:58,765 --> 00:02:00,289
Like every lndia-Pakistan match,

10
00:02:00,367 --> 00:02:05,464
this match means so much
more than the game itself.

11
00:02:05,739 --> 00:02:07,434
Only 1 and a half minutes now

12
00:02:07,507 --> 00:02:09,805
and lndia will have to
fight quickly to save itself.

13
00:02:11,378 --> 00:02:16,441
Ball with Pakistani
defender Waseem.. Scoop!

14
00:02:20,754 --> 00:02:25,384
But lndian defender Uttam Singh
snatches it.. lndia is now on attack!

15
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,798
And a penalty stroke for lndia..

16
00:03:08,902 --> 00:03:13,965
A breath of life
they desperately need..

17
00:03:15,842 --> 00:03:17,901
But who will take this stroke..

18
00:03:17,978 --> 00:03:19,445
Ball! Ball!

19
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:23,475
Saini has the ball, but Captain
Kabir is taking the stroke himself..

20
00:03:24,851 --> 00:03:25,909
Maybe a good decision.

21
00:03:26,052 --> 00:03:29,783
lndia's best player
is its last hope...

22
00:04:51,171 --> 00:04:53,537
Coach, is this the same team
that defeated Pakistan last year?

23
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:54,968
No comments.

24
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:58,135
Do you not think our
team is taking it too easy?

25
00:04:58,211 --> 00:04:59,769
Please, please, no comments.

26
00:05:01,715 --> 00:05:02,807
Hey, look, it is Kabir!
- Kabir!

27
00:05:02,882 --> 00:05:05,544
He is here!
- Kabir.. Kabir.. Kabir,

28
00:05:05,652 --> 00:05:07,711
do you have anything to say
about such an embarrassing defeat?

29
00:05:07,821 --> 00:05:09,982
Do you really believe
Pakistan's performance was better?

30
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:12,888
Maybe. - Why did you take
the penalty stroke yourself?

31
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:14,017
l made a mistake

32
00:05:14,094 --> 00:05:16,494
Rumour has it that the Pakistani
players are your good friends..

33
00:05:16,563 --> 00:05:19,862
you were the only lndian to
congratulate them after the match..

34
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,158
Excuse me!

35
00:05:21,234 --> 00:05:22,496
People are saying..
there is a rumour that you..

36
00:05:22,569 --> 00:05:25,663
or someone else in the lndian team
has deliberately thrown this match?

37
00:05:25,772 --> 00:05:26,830
Excuse me!

38
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:29,807
Do you think we lost
because someone sold out?

39
00:05:30,877 --> 00:05:33,573
What! What did you say?

40
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,875
Kabir Khan, has
someone sold out their team?

41
00:05:35,949 --> 00:05:37,007
Sold out! You piece of..

42
00:05:40,887 --> 00:05:41,945
How dare you..

43
00:05:46,593 --> 00:05:48,788
How can you disrespect the media!

44
00:05:48,862 --> 00:05:50,591
Disrespect the media!
You son of a.. Come here.

45
00:05:50,664 --> 00:05:52,689
You do not know how
to treat journalists!

46
00:05:52,799 --> 00:05:54,164
You bloody -.. sold out

47
00:05:57,604 --> 00:05:58,696
Come back here!

48
00:05:59,673 --> 00:06:01,538
You just witnessed a
frustrated captain of the loosing

49
00:06:01,608 --> 00:06:03,872
team attack the media violently.

50
00:06:04,044 --> 00:06:06,535
His outburst cannot
hide the fact that there..

51
00:06:06,613 --> 00:06:09,741
..is definitely
something fishy going on.

52
00:06:09,983 --> 00:06:11,610
We have our answers.

53
00:06:11,718 --> 00:06:13,549
But it is now up to
you to decide whether

54
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:16,680
Kabir Khan has played
dirty with the country or not.

55
00:06:17,691 --> 00:06:21,058
Satyavrat Yadav,
National Stadium, New Delhi..

56
00:06:21,628 --> 00:06:23,152
News from the world of sports.

57
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:27,564
Pakistan has become the
new Hockey World Champions

58
00:06:27,634 --> 00:06:30,626
after defeating lndia by one goal.

59
00:06:36,843 --> 00:06:40,574
Today the Chairman of the
Hockey Association denounced

60
00:06:40,647 --> 00:06:45,084
Kabir Khan, declared he
did his country wrong.

61
00:06:45,151 --> 00:06:48,643
And all this is thanks to you..
the lndian public.

62
00:06:48,722 --> 00:06:49,916
We have two special guests..

63
00:06:56,996 --> 00:06:58,861
Down with Kabir!

64
00:07:01,668 --> 00:07:04,159
What do you think? Did
Kabir Khan fix the match?

65
00:07:04,304 --> 00:07:06,067
Do not know if he fixed the match,
but we lost because of him.

66
00:07:06,139 --> 00:07:07,197
And what would you say?

67
00:07:07,273 --> 00:07:09,138
These people should
be hung upside down.

68
00:07:09,209 --> 00:07:10,267
And you?

69
00:07:10,343 --> 00:07:14,040
These kind of people should have
moved to Pakistan during the partition.

70
00:07:14,114 --> 00:07:17,675
Down with Kabir!

71
00:07:22,055 --> 00:07:23,682
The public is upset with
the team's performance.

72
00:07:23,757 --> 00:07:24,849
And Kabir Khan has
conveniently disappeared.

73
00:07:24,924 --> 00:07:28,087
He was not at the hockey stadium, nor
the Sports Authority of lndia Campus.

74
00:07:28,161 --> 00:07:29,219
Where is Kabir Khan?

75
00:08:13,072 --> 00:08:15,097
Do not look back mother, let us go.

76
00:08:15,742 --> 00:08:16,834
How can l not, Kabir..

77
00:08:19,179 --> 00:08:24,207
Your grandfather saved every
penny to build this house..

78
00:08:25,752 --> 00:08:30,382
Your father's first pay check
went into making these windows..

79
00:08:32,025 --> 00:08:34,084
l stepped into this
home as a young bride..

80
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:40,421
Whatever happens, l know all these
people will stand by us, trust me.

81
00:08:43,102 --> 00:08:50,133
My master

82
00:08:51,311 --> 00:08:53,370
TRAlTOR

83
00:08:55,982 --> 00:08:57,415
Do not look there, son.

84
00:09:00,854 --> 00:09:02,788
You can close your eyes if
you can not bear to see it..

85
00:09:05,124 --> 00:09:06,216
l want to see everything.

86
00:09:06,793 --> 00:09:08,317
TRAlTOR

87
00:09:08,394 --> 00:09:10,089
Come son. Let us go!

88
00:09:10,797 --> 00:09:15,131
The third colour of
your being, that was l

89
00:09:15,201 --> 00:09:17,795
Papa, papa, l want to see
what a traitor looks like.

90
00:09:17,904 --> 00:09:18,996
Come, see!

91
00:09:19,072 --> 00:09:24,908
Your tune was the rhythm of my life

92
00:09:24,978 --> 00:09:26,741
Just some food for the road..

93
00:09:26,813 --> 00:09:28,075
Do you want us to be
thrown out of the neighbourhood?

94
00:09:28,147 --> 00:09:31,241
My divine master, you are my pride

95
00:09:31,317 --> 00:09:41,249
My master, my life is yours to take

96
00:10:31,878 --> 00:10:33,038
So, what have you decided?

97
00:10:33,179 --> 00:10:38,014
Uttamji, you are always
harping on the same thing.

98
00:10:39,218 --> 00:10:40,879
What should we do about the coach?

99
00:10:42,221 --> 00:10:43,279
Hey, why don't you
become their coach?

100
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:46,188
The Women's Hockey World Cup
is just three months away.

101
00:10:46,292 --> 00:10:47,987
The team cannot just go
without any training..

102
00:10:48,161 --> 00:10:50,026
No matter how much you
train them, they will loose..

103
00:10:51,898 --> 00:10:54,332
The lndian Women's hockey
team has never achieved anything

104
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,458
and it never will.

105
00:10:56,235 --> 00:10:58,499
lt is a government trip.

106
00:11:00,907 --> 00:11:03,000
Why do you not go as their coach?

107
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:09,079
The team will be out in a
couple of matches. Exit!

108
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:14,481
You and your wife
could enjoy a holiday.

109
00:11:17,557 --> 00:11:21,049
l do not get it - why do you not
take women's hockey seriously.

110
00:11:21,361 --> 00:11:24,990
And we do no get why
you take it so seriously.

111
00:11:25,298 --> 00:11:29,564
Uttamji, lndian women
are born to cook and clean.

112
00:11:30,036 --> 00:11:33,938
They cannot run
around in short skirts.

113
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:38,109
How can an Association
member say such things?

114
00:11:38,177 --> 00:11:39,235
lt is because we are
in the Association

115
00:11:39,312 --> 00:11:41,473
and have travelled around the
world, that we can say such things.

116
00:11:43,383 --> 00:11:49,117
Look, you have done your part and
selected the top 16 lndian players.

117
00:11:49,222 --> 00:11:56,253
Punjab, Tamil Nadu,
Jharkand, Andhra, Railways.

118
00:11:57,597 --> 00:12:00,566
You have even been to
remote Manipur and Mizoram.

119
00:12:01,067 --> 00:12:04,298
But now where will you
find a coach? From the moon?

120
00:12:06,005 --> 00:12:07,370
ls this also the girls' fault?

121
00:12:07,974 --> 00:12:09,134
No, lt is not the girls' fault.

122
00:12:09,275 --> 00:12:11,505
lt is the fault, of people like
you with expectations from them.

123
00:12:13,546 --> 00:12:17,983
No sponsors.. no viewers..
no TV coverage, nor media..

124
00:12:18,084 --> 00:12:22,521
Now which coach will want to jump
into this mess to ruin his career?

125
00:12:22,588 --> 00:12:23,987
ls there anyone? No one.

126
00:12:25,558 --> 00:12:26,616
There is one man.

127
00:12:28,261 --> 00:12:29,319
Who?

128
00:12:30,163 --> 00:12:31,289
Kabir.

129
00:12:35,001 --> 00:12:36,059
Who?

130
00:12:36,135 --> 00:12:37,193
Kabir Khan.

131
00:12:40,006 --> 00:12:41,166
The Kabir Khan who..

132
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,298
Yes that one.

133
00:12:43,009 --> 00:12:45,068
Since when has he developed
an interest in women's hockey?

134
00:12:46,045 --> 00:12:48,275
He even left men's hockey years ago.

135
00:12:49,015 --> 00:12:51,176
No one has seen him
for six-seven years.

136
00:12:51,317 --> 00:12:52,375
You can see him now.

137
00:12:52,452 --> 00:12:53,510
Where?

138
00:12:53,619 --> 00:12:55,018
Outside. ln the reception.

139
00:13:11,537 --> 00:13:15,439
Do not attack the opposing
team's goal but their minds.

140
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:19,039
You will win the goal automatically.

141
00:13:19,212 --> 00:13:20,338
Sir
- Hmm?

142
00:13:20,413 --> 00:13:21,471
You have been called inside.

143
00:13:28,354 --> 00:13:29,616
Sir
- Kabir.

144
00:13:35,061 --> 00:13:36,392
How many years has it..

145
00:13:36,462 --> 00:13:41,058
Seven years, three months.. ten,
eleven, twelve, thirteen

146
00:13:41,134 --> 00:13:42,499
7 years, 3 months, 14 days.

147
00:13:44,403 --> 00:13:48,100
What.. what were you
doing all these years?

148
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:51,138
l was preparing for this meeting.

149
00:13:51,277 --> 00:13:54,212
He wants to be the coach of
the lndian Women's Hockey Team.

150
00:13:58,151 --> 00:14:00,085
You are not a child Mr. Kabir Khan.

151
00:14:01,354 --> 00:14:03,015
You know in a country like ours,

152
00:14:03,089 --> 00:14:08,493
a women's team exists just
as a formality, not a reality.

153
00:14:10,263 --> 00:14:14,097
Your reputation is already..

154
00:14:16,702 --> 00:14:22,436
And you wish to redeem your
name by coaching this team.

155
00:14:23,109 --> 00:14:28,479
A team that is not fit to play
against European high schools.

156
00:14:33,753 --> 00:14:35,380
This is exactly the team l want.

157
00:14:36,122 --> 00:14:38,352
l do not understand..

158
00:14:39,692 --> 00:14:41,387
l do not think you would.

159
00:14:48,167 --> 00:14:50,226
So shall l consider myself hired?

160
00:14:53,573 --> 00:14:56,508
ln any case, you do
not have another coach.

161
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,187
l have done all l could,

162
00:15:17,496 --> 00:15:19,225
but you should think about it.

163
00:15:19,332 --> 00:15:20,458
l have.

164
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,531
Kabir this not a team.
lt is a graveyard.

165
00:15:25,338 --> 00:15:26,600
Why are you burying in it?

166
00:15:29,542 --> 00:15:31,476
This team will never get
a better coach than you.

167
00:15:31,811 --> 00:15:33,244
But think about yourself.

168
00:15:33,379 --> 00:15:34,437
l am thinking about myself.

169
00:15:37,316 --> 00:15:40,285
You have changed.
You have changed a lot.

170
00:15:40,453 --> 00:15:44,355
l have not changed. Nothing has.

171
00:15:47,627 --> 00:15:49,458
You know we did not lose
that match because of you.

172
00:15:50,196 --> 00:15:52,494
You did all you could to
score a goal against Pakistan

173
00:15:53,266 --> 00:15:59,330
But they scored against me, my
team, my country.. and my family.

174
00:16:00,206 --> 00:16:01,639
Everybody is allowed one mistake.

175
00:16:05,378 --> 00:16:06,470
Everybody?

176
00:16:10,549 --> 00:16:13,211
Kabir, why have you come back?

177
00:16:15,254 --> 00:16:17,484
To help this team to
win the World Cup.

178
00:16:18,491 --> 00:16:19,617
Which is impossible..

179
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:21,854
ls what needs to be done.

180
00:16:23,629 --> 00:16:25,597
when are your 16 girls coming?

181
00:16:26,532 --> 00:16:28,830
They should reach here tomorrow
morning from their respective states.

182
00:16:29,669 --> 00:16:32,695
States.. nothing has changed.

183
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:36,467
There were states then,
there are states now..

184
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,098
There you go..

185
00:17:11,977 --> 00:17:13,035
Well ma'am, once again it looks like

186
00:17:13,112 --> 00:17:15,603
the Association has
dumped all of lndia on us.

187
00:17:17,249 --> 00:17:19,183
So these are the best?

188
00:17:19,285 --> 00:17:20,343
That's what they say.

189
00:17:22,321 --> 00:17:25,154
Wasn't she the
goalkeeper for the Railways?

190
00:17:25,357 --> 00:17:26,415
What was her name?

191
00:17:26,525 --> 00:17:28,390
Vidya.. Vidya Sharma.

192
00:17:29,328 --> 00:17:32,422
Heard she got
married and quit hockey?

193
00:17:33,165 --> 00:17:34,223
Well she's here..

194
00:17:41,273 --> 00:17:45,437
100 rupees? My foot! ls
the meter for decoration?

195
00:17:45,544 --> 00:17:47,171
The meter is broken, you
will have to give me 100.

196
00:17:47,246 --> 00:17:49,146
l will give you 100 slaps!
- What sort of talk is that?

197
00:17:49,214 --> 00:17:52,274
The kind you will understand! Take the
50 or l will shove the hockey stick!

198
00:17:52,351 --> 00:17:53,409
Don't get angry.

199
00:17:53,619 --> 00:17:55,985
Your head will
explode one of these days.

200
00:17:56,088 --> 00:17:58,056
But grandma, you are not
saying anything to him.

201
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:00,249
ls he my baby or are you?

202
00:18:00,993 --> 00:18:02,290

- So?

203
00:18:02,361 --> 00:18:03,623
Cool down, come, come.. drink it in.

204
00:18:34,526 --> 00:18:36,016
Hey! What the.. you brats!

205
00:18:38,297 --> 00:18:39,355
Hey Komal!

206
00:18:44,036 --> 00:18:46,470
These pansies! Thought
l'd show them how to play!

207
00:18:47,439 --> 00:18:49,407
You haven't come
here to play with boys!

208
00:18:49,508 --> 00:18:50,566
No.. just wanted to check out

209
00:18:50,643 --> 00:18:52,406
whether these Delhi dudes can play.

210
00:18:52,544 --> 00:18:54,205
There's no way l'm letting my
girl play in a big city like Delhi.

211
00:18:54,313 --> 00:18:56,247
Come on. Let's go,
get back in the car

212
00:18:56,315 --> 00:18:57,373
Oh come now! We have come this far..

213
00:18:57,449 --> 00:18:58,973
Let her do what
she wants. After all,

214
00:18:59,051 --> 00:19:01,349
she will be playing a home
maker for the rest of her life.

215
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:02,478
l will never give up playing!

216
00:19:02,554 --> 00:19:04,249
Oh yeah? What will you feed
your husband when he is hungry?

217
00:19:04,323 --> 00:19:05,381
This!

218
00:19:05,457 --> 00:19:07,084
Enough! l don't want
my girl playing hockey.

219
00:19:08,694 --> 00:19:12,425
Once she slips out of our grasp,
who will ask for her hand?

220
00:19:12,531 --> 00:19:13,589
Let them try!

221
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:26,075
Gul, your grandfathers,
your father, your brother

222
00:19:26,145 --> 00:19:29,273
all have excelled in
this game, my dear.

Soimoi.

227
00:19:51,236 --> 00:19:53,568
l asked for your name.
Not your medical condition.

228
00:19:53,639 --> 00:19:54,697

229
00:19:55,107 --> 00:19:56,506

Rani Dispotta.

235
00:20:12,191 --> 00:20:14,250
Are you from the travelling theatre?

236
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,660
The stadium won't be
available till the new year. Go away!

237
00:20:20,466 --> 00:20:24,766
Ghamorni.. state board.. Jharkhand..

238
00:20:26,405 --> 00:20:28,464
Oh dear!

239
00:20:29,441 --> 00:20:31,500
These two are hockey players!

240
00:20:31,577 --> 00:20:32,635
Ho, ho, ho!

241
00:20:36,248 --> 00:20:38,182

00:20:38,283 --> 00:20:39,341

Telegu.

00:20:41,286 --> 00:20:42,344
Tamil.

245
00:20:42,421 --> 00:20:43,547
Not Tamil, Telegu.

246
00:20:43,655 --> 00:20:47,182
Same thing. What's the
difference between Tamil and Telegu?

247
00:20:47,292 --> 00:20:50,420
The same difference that is
there between Punjabi and Bihari.

248
00:20:50,496 --> 00:20:51,554
Oh really?

249
00:20:52,331 --> 00:20:53,457
Can l go?

250
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:56,225

251
00:20:56,301 --> 00:20:57,359
Ho ho!

252

Man! Look at that vanilla ice
cream amidst all this chocolate!

253
00:21:17,756 --> 00:21:19,121
Must be heading to a
disco or a nightclub..

254
00:21:19,191 --> 00:21:21,455
Looks like they lost their way.

255
00:21:21,627 --> 00:21:24,790
You think they are players?

256
00:21:24,863 --> 00:21:27,229
Definitely players. But not here..

257
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:30,426
Ya? Wonder what
the going rates are..

258
00:21:30,569 --> 00:21:32,730
Why don't you ask them? They
won't get our language anyway

259
00:21:33,272 --> 00:21:34,762
Hey, how much are those melons for?

260
00:21:37,509 --> 00:21:39,841
What the.. They understand Hindi!

261
00:21:40,212 --> 00:21:42,237

Would you be happy being treated
like an alien in your own country?

267
00:22:16,815 --> 00:22:18,544
Bindia, Aliya how are you?

Understand this once and for all,
because l won't repeat it.

334
00:25:45,891 --> 00:25:49,554
This team needs only those
players who first play for lndia,

00:25:50,095 --> 00:25:52,620
then for their teammates,

336

life left, for themselves.

00:26:33,138 --> 00:26:34,867
Gunjan Lakhani, lndia

354
00:26:35,574 --> 00:26:37,667
Bindia Naik, lndia

355
00:26:39,945 --> 00:26:42,573
Preeti Sabarwal, lndia

356
00:26:59,531 --> 00:27:00,828
Come on, move it, move it

357
00:27:16,982 --> 00:27:18,916
Didi(elder sister), didi! You
are Bindia Naik, aren't you?

358
00:27:19,217 --> 00:27:21,014
You hold a National
record of 42 goals!

359
00:27:21,086 --> 00:27:22,144
So?

360
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:24,688
l am so happy to meet you!

361
00:27:24,856 --> 00:27:26,050
Yay! Go dance then!

362
00:27:45,577 --> 00:27:46,839
On the list this is my bed.

363
00:27:48,013 --> 00:27:50,573
There's the list. Go sleep there.

364
00:27:52,584 --> 00:27:53,642
Forget it Molly!

365
00:27:53,852 --> 00:27:54,910
Correct.

366
00:27:55,587 --> 00:27:56,645
Hello! l am Nethra.

367
00:27:56,721 --> 00:27:57,779
Vidya.

368
00:27:57,856 --> 00:28:01,758
l know. You saved 4 goals in
the South Zone tournament.

369
00:28:02,227 --> 00:28:04,024
Didn't save them,
just happened somehow.

370
00:28:04,095 --> 00:28:05,153
lt was all luck.

371
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:07,757
Only good players have good 'luck'.

372
00:28:14,005 --> 00:28:16,269
Whoa.. what's this?

373
00:28:17,943 --> 00:28:19,001
Ho?

374
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:20,702
What is this?

375
00:28:20,812 --> 00:28:22,643
'Moke daayar se laglak'

376
00:28:23,248 --> 00:28:25,978
She is saying a branch scraped her
while travelling on an elephant.

377
00:28:26,618 --> 00:28:28,813
You came to Delhi on an elephant?

378
00:28:29,921 --> 00:28:31,684
No, only till Gha-morni. (morni
- peacock)

379
00:28:31,823 --> 00:28:36,055
Peacocks? What peacock?
Peacocks, elephants..

380
00:28:36,127 --> 00:28:37,890
You live in a zoo?

381
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:40,996
Jharkhand. We are from Jharkhand.

382
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:43,993
[Jhadi=bush]

383
00:28:44,836 --> 00:28:46,770
Oh! Lots of bushes there?

384
00:28:47,105 --> 00:28:49,767
Jungle. lt is a jungle there.

385
00:28:49,908 --> 00:28:52,638
Jungle? Are you Junglees?

386
00:28:52,811 --> 00:28:55,041
You eat snakes and scorpions? l
hope there aren't any in your bag?

387
00:28:57,749 --> 00:29:01,685
Are you upset?

388
00:29:02,988 --> 00:29:05,752
Alright! Here
- you sleep on the floor.

389
00:29:15,033 --> 00:29:16,728
What are you doing?

390
00:29:16,835 --> 00:29:17,961
Sorry?

391
00:29:18,069 --> 00:29:20,663
Nothing to be sorry about..
move this..

392
00:29:20,805 --> 00:29:22,932
What the
- What do you think you're doing?

393
00:29:23,008 --> 00:29:24,236
This is my bed.

394
00:29:24,876 --> 00:29:27,071
Did you not see
this big bundle here?

395
00:29:27,145 --> 00:29:28,203
So?

396
00:29:28,313 --> 00:29:31,248
So? l put it here first,
so the bed is mine.

397
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:33,980
Just because you dumped
this bundle, it is your bed?

398
00:29:34,085 --> 00:29:36,679
Of course! Haven't you
ever been on a state bus?

399
00:29:36,788 --> 00:29:38,688
l have reserved this bed first!

400
00:29:39,324 --> 00:29:40,814
lt is mine on the list.

401
00:29:41,693 --> 00:29:46,027
Oh you.. what the..

402
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,701
l will smash your face!

403
00:29:56,775 --> 00:29:57,833
Hey kid!

404
00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:00,841
Get here.

405
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:02,938
C'mon!

406
00:30:11,156 --> 00:30:13,090
There is a time and
place for every fight.

407
00:30:13,191 --> 00:30:17,127
Save this one for another day
- when you have the upper hand.

408
00:30:18,797 --> 00:30:19,889
Get out!

409
00:30:21,733 --> 00:30:24,258
Come. Be on this side with us.

410
00:30:34,779 --> 00:30:36,838
The travelling theatre
would have been better!

411
00:30:39,317 --> 00:30:41,683
l am told that from
the 250 million girls

412
00:30:41,753 --> 00:30:45,746
in this country you are
the 16 best hockey players.

413
00:30:48,927 --> 00:30:51,122
You're lucky, but also unlucky.

414
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:54,958
Because now l'll be the judge.

415
00:30:56,201 --> 00:31:00,831
For me, you are only 16
girls who dabble in hockey.

416
00:31:01,806 --> 00:31:04,775
Don't expect anymore.
You'll regret it.

417
00:31:12,784 --> 00:31:19,087
Ten kilometers. Everyone Come on!

418
00:31:19,858 --> 00:31:21,052
Come on, girls!

419
00:31:21,993 --> 00:31:23,961
Training us for a
marathon or a match?

420
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,218
Hey!

421
00:32:10,275 --> 00:32:12,334
Running at 4am won't make
us better hockey players.

422
00:32:14,312 --> 00:32:19,841
How dare he treat national
players like this! We're not kids.

423
00:32:20,051 --> 00:32:21,416
Does he think we
don't know how to train?

424
00:32:26,191 --> 00:32:33,063
Move, you..

425
00:32:38,236 --> 00:32:39,430
Take your positions.
What's going on?

426
00:32:43,041 --> 00:32:44,133
What's the problem?

427
00:32:44,876 --> 00:32:45,934
You are playing right in.

428
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:47,068
But sir..

429
00:32:47,145 --> 00:32:48,976
l think you will
play better as right in.

430
00:32:49,047 --> 00:32:52,073
But.. l have always played
center forward for our Haryana team..

431
00:32:52,183 --> 00:32:55,983
Ok, go! Play for the Haryana team.
Everybody in position!

432
00:33:06,297 --> 00:33:07,355
What is it?

433
00:33:07,465 --> 00:33:09,262
Coach sir has instructed me
to play on the forward line.

434
00:33:11,402 --> 00:33:12,926
Go home and play.

435
00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:22,907
Listen
- push her out and take her place.

436
00:33:23,014 --> 00:33:24,242
But the coach has asked me
to play in this position.

437
00:33:24,315 --> 00:33:26,340
So if the coach asks you
to jump in a well, you will?

438
00:33:26,918 --> 00:33:27,976
But the coach..

439
00:33:28,052 --> 00:33:32,421
Look, coaches will come and go.
But you will be with us, right?

440
00:33:33,124 --> 00:33:34,318
Yes, but coach..

441
00:33:34,392 --> 00:33:36,189
See, she's leaving to
drink water. Grab her place.

442
00:33:37,228 --> 00:33:39,253
Don't take my name.

443
00:33:46,938 --> 00:33:47,996
What's going on?

444
00:33:50,375 --> 00:33:52,240
l play forward every year.

445
00:33:52,343 --> 00:33:53,935
Yes but in this team
you are the centre..

446
00:33:54,012 --> 00:33:56,572
This team or that team it
doesn't make a difference.

447
00:33:57,348 --> 00:33:59,043
lt makes a difference to the team.

448
00:33:59,617 --> 00:34:01,312
You're a senior player,
a strong player.

449
00:34:01,586 --> 00:34:06,455
The team needs you at centre half.
Go to your new position.

450
00:34:08,259 --> 00:34:09,317
Sorry.

451
00:34:09,961 --> 00:34:11,019
Hmmm.

452
00:34:14,365 --> 00:34:15,423
Out.

453
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:16,558
What..

454
00:34:16,634 --> 00:34:19,467
Sit out and let the
others play.. Out!

455
00:35:05,083 --> 00:35:06,482
Move!

456
00:35:20,465 --> 00:35:22,695
Good goal! Very
good Preeti Sabarwal!

457
00:35:26,237 --> 00:35:27,602
Come on everyone, back to one!

458
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:42,416
Komal! Pass the ball!

459
00:35:44,389 --> 00:35:46,448
l'm free, dammit, pass the ball!

460
00:36:03,508 --> 00:36:05,373
Komal! Komal!

461
00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:13,474
What was that?

462
00:36:14,085 --> 00:36:15,177
l scored a goal sir!

463
00:36:15,286 --> 00:36:16,344
Out!

464
00:36:18,756 --> 00:36:22,157
But you didn't see
what that girl was up to!

465
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:24,091
l saw everything
that's going on here.

466
00:36:24,195 --> 00:36:26,220
When she scored the goal
there was no one around her,

467
00:36:27,432 --> 00:36:29,559
But when you scored, she was there.

468
00:36:29,634 --> 00:36:31,431
And the only one in
the scoring position ..

469
00:36:34,605 --> 00:36:35,663
Out!

470
00:36:41,746 --> 00:36:44,579
Everybody can only see the
Memsahib but are blind to her faults.

471
00:36:44,682 --> 00:36:48,174
The British have gone but left
behind their Memsahibs in cities.

472
00:36:48,319 --> 00:36:49,616
Just step in my village once!

473
00:36:50,121 --> 00:36:52,214
lf l don't tie you up with the
buffalo's tail, you can change my name.

474
00:36:54,292 --> 00:36:55,418
Coach took Memsahib's side.

475
00:36:58,262 --> 00:37:00,628
He's only a coach, not God.

476
00:37:07,205 --> 00:37:09,765
Come let us rest for a while.

477
00:37:23,254 --> 00:37:24,346
Hey!

478
00:37:41,506 --> 00:37:42,564
Out..

479
00:37:54,185 --> 00:37:56,119
So chowmein! Get angry once more and

480
00:37:56,187 --> 00:37:58,747
They will pour chilli
sauce on you and chew you up.

481
00:38:05,829 --> 00:38:07,228
Come, come here!

482
00:38:07,831 --> 00:38:12,825
Take it, take it, take it, damn you!

483
00:38:12,903 --> 00:38:17,169
Moka! Moka (Pass to me!)

484
00:38:18,275 --> 00:38:21,301
Stop it, stop that, stop the ball..

485
00:38:23,146 --> 00:38:25,171
You piece of.. go kill
yourself or l will kill you.

486
00:38:27,017 --> 00:38:28,143
The bloody..

487
00:38:28,852 --> 00:38:29,910
What happened?

488
00:38:29,987 --> 00:38:31,887
Did you not see? This
witch let them score a goal!

489
00:38:32,055 --> 00:38:34,114
You know she can not
understand Punjabi.

490
00:38:34,191 --> 00:38:35,920
She should have learnt
it before coming here!

491
00:38:36,093 --> 00:38:38,152
She was only supposed to have
learnt hockey. Which she has.

492
00:38:38,862 --> 00:38:39,954
Apologize to her.

493
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:42,130
l have never apologized
- not even to my father!

494
00:38:42,199 --> 00:38:43,257
Out..

495
00:38:43,333 --> 00:38:44,391
What!

496
00:38:44,501 --> 00:38:45,991
Out! Out!

497
00:38:47,037 --> 00:38:49,130
Why do you not tell her off?

498
00:38:49,239 --> 00:38:51,070
She is not worth talking to

499
00:38:52,509 --> 00:38:54,374
l have always said
- do not play with Junglees!

500
00:38:58,215 --> 00:38:59,876
You look very angry.

501
00:39:00,917 --> 00:39:02,282
You looked like you
would break her head..

502
00:39:02,352 --> 00:39:03,410
Should l break yours?

503
00:39:18,235 --> 00:39:21,295
Sir, how long should
these girls be benched?

504
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,532
Don't know.

505
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:30,073
l do not think anyone can teach
these girls to play hockey together.

506
00:39:30,247 --> 00:39:32,306
Teaching them hockey
is a long way off.

507
00:39:32,916 --> 00:39:35,214
l need to teach them
something else first.

508
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,178
Good evening!

509
00:40:16,293 --> 00:40:17,351
What is going on?

510
00:40:17,961 --> 00:40:19,087
New sleeping arrangements?

511
00:40:19,529 --> 00:40:21,429
Old.. according to the old list.

512
00:40:21,498 --> 00:40:23,227
So? Tell them the list tore..

513
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,192
come on, go to your old place.

514
00:40:25,302 --> 00:40:27,964
No girl will stay with
another girl from her own state.

515
00:40:28,071 --> 00:40:29,197
lt is the Coach's order.

516
00:40:29,973 --> 00:40:32,271
So let him say it. Who cares?

517
00:40:32,342 --> 00:40:33,400
Everyone else has agreed.

518
00:40:33,477 --> 00:40:36,105
lf you have any
problems speak to the coach.

519
00:40:38,181 --> 00:40:41,412
Bake in sun all day,
switch beds at night..

520
00:40:42,619 --> 00:40:45,053
ls this a National
camp or a refugee camp?

521
00:40:45,555 --> 00:40:49,651
Why doesn't he make every
one sleep on the benches?

522
00:40:52,996 --> 00:40:54,088
How are you?

523
00:40:54,164 --> 00:40:55,563
l have had enough, please come back.

524
00:40:55,999 --> 00:40:57,193
l cannot come.

525
00:40:57,267 --> 00:41:00,998
lt is uncle Samir's sister's wedding.
Mom and dad asked me to call you.

526
00:41:01,104 --> 00:41:03,004
Rakesh you know this
is the National camp-

527
00:41:03,073 --> 00:41:04,165
But Vidya..

528
00:41:04,241 --> 00:41:07,369
Look, family comes first,
games later..

529
00:41:07,444 --> 00:41:08,536
But, father-in-law..

530
00:41:08,612 --> 00:41:10,477
Look, you insisted,
so we let you play.

531
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:12,639
Now we are calling you, so
come back by the next train.

532
00:41:13,016 --> 00:41:14,074
Yes.. but l..

533
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:19,547
Rakesh please understand.
l cannot come.

534
00:41:20,023 --> 00:41:22,218
l have waited a long
time for this camp.

535
00:41:22,325 --> 00:41:25,158
Vidya, you are a saint.
But l am not.

536
00:41:25,295 --> 00:41:26,956
l cannot keep waiting. The
wedding is day after tomorrow.

537
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:29,055
Come if you want or forget it.

538
00:41:42,312 --> 00:41:43,472
So?

539
00:41:43,547 --> 00:41:44,980
They wanted a
traditional daughter-in-law..

540
00:41:45,048 --> 00:41:47,141
..grandchildren, the
whole work from me..

541
00:41:49,486 --> 00:41:51,351
..but all l have is
this hockey stick.

542
00:41:51,454 --> 00:41:55,618
Oh! ls this how you scare them away?

543
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:03,688
lf you want, you can go
home for a couple of days.

544
00:42:05,202 --> 00:42:07,329
lf l go now, l will not come back.

545
00:42:08,071 --> 00:42:10,369
lt is either this side. Or that.

546
00:42:16,413 --> 00:42:18,643
But.. When you
were getting married..

547
00:42:18,715 --> 00:42:21,377
l told them everything.
They were thrilled then..

548
00:42:22,485 --> 00:42:25,215
l had a job thanks to the sports
quota as well as a government flat.

549
00:42:27,724 --> 00:42:30,249
So now?

550
00:42:32,095 --> 00:42:33,153
They have gotten used to the flat,..

551
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:35,289
..now they want somebody
who will take care of it.

552
00:42:40,403 --> 00:42:43,167
You think lt is crime to
play hockey in this country?

553
00:42:44,741 --> 00:42:51,670
No, no you can play politics,
cricket..

554
00:42:52,749 --> 00:42:54,216
you sure can play cricket!

555
00:42:56,119 --> 00:42:57,450
But hockey?

556
00:43:00,290 --> 00:43:01,416
lt is a little difficult.

557
00:43:04,461 --> 00:43:06,326
Have you heard of
Mohammad bin Tuglaq?

558
00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:08,222
ls he cute?

559
00:43:09,266 --> 00:43:11,393
He was an emperor
- five hundred years ago.

560
00:43:12,435 --> 00:43:15,461
Crazy guy! Drove everyone mad.

561
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:20,234
Stopped making gold and
silver coins for copper ones.

562
00:43:20,810 --> 00:43:22,334
Out in five years.

563
00:43:23,446 --> 00:43:25,471
That is how this
coach is going to go.

564
00:43:26,483 --> 00:43:27,541
Thinks he can do anything.

565
00:43:28,151 --> 00:43:31,450
lf you have such a sharp brain,
why do you not use when you play?

566
00:43:31,554 --> 00:43:35,285
He will be out in a few days.
The Association will kick him out.

567
00:43:36,192 --> 00:43:37,318
The system does not work like this.

568
00:43:40,163 --> 00:43:42,529
The name suits him
- Tuglaq.

569
00:43:49,172 --> 00:43:51,800
Molly, Balbir,

570
00:43:53,343 --> 00:43:54,435
Komal,

571
00:43:58,248 --> 00:43:59,306
Bindia, Aliya -

572
00:44:00,317 --> 00:44:01,579
You are benched.

573
00:44:08,458 --> 00:44:11,621
So till we do not play by his
rules he will not let us play.

574
00:44:13,263 --> 00:44:14,662
Tuglaq has lost it.

575
00:44:16,499 --> 00:44:18,763
Alright. We are no less.

576
00:44:19,336 --> 00:44:20,735
We will now play
only at the tournament.

577
00:44:22,539 --> 00:44:24,268
Sir! Hey sir!

578
00:44:28,645 --> 00:44:32,240
Sir, l would like to play too.

579
00:44:36,519 --> 00:44:37,747
Ok, Ok.. l am really sorry.

580
00:44:42,592 --> 00:44:43,684
Sorry

581
00:44:46,229 --> 00:44:48,390
Hey, ok enough.. come on,
accept my apology

582
00:44:52,302 --> 00:44:53,428
Accepting it, or should l hit you?

583
00:45:00,243 --> 00:45:01,335
Sorry.

584
00:45:01,511 --> 00:45:04,480
Really sorry.

585
00:45:18,595 --> 00:45:20,256
Actually, she is not a bad player.

586
00:45:20,330 --> 00:45:22,890
When she whacks the ball hard,
it takes four girls to stop it.

587
00:45:23,266 --> 00:45:24,358
Admiring your enemy?

588
00:45:25,435 --> 00:45:26,561
Please do not pull my leg, didi.

589
00:45:26,636 --> 00:45:28,467
The coach has already
stopped us from playing.

590
00:45:28,538 --> 00:45:29,596
And then..

591
00:45:29,672 --> 00:45:30,730
Oh man..

592
00:45:33,276 --> 00:45:34,368
Oh.. oh!

593
00:45:37,447 --> 00:45:38,573
Come didi, let us play..

594
00:45:38,648 --> 00:45:40,912
lf we play, we will play in our
own positions. Shut up and sit down.

595
00:45:48,291 --> 00:45:49,519
God, look there is
bull chasing her..

596
00:45:51,594 --> 00:45:54,461
You've already scored your forty
two goals. l haven't even started.

597
00:45:56,666 --> 00:45:59,294
Sir let me also get a
pardon from the memsahib.

598
00:46:06,476 --> 00:46:07,534
Hey missy, do you want
to accept my apology?

599
00:46:07,610 --> 00:46:08,770
Or do you prefer going to the jail?
- What?

600
00:46:08,845 --> 00:46:11,541
Look, if you do not
pardon me, l will fight you..

601
00:46:11,648 --> 00:46:14,583
in the fight either l will smash
your head or you will smash mine

602
00:46:14,684 --> 00:46:16,311
and we will have to go to jail..

603
00:46:16,386 --> 00:46:18,445
Anyway.. so tell me do you accept my
apology or should we go to the police?

604
00:46:38,341 --> 00:46:39,603
Time is up. Come on!

605
00:46:40,343 --> 00:46:41,674
Krishnaji, is anyone injured?

606
00:46:43,346 --> 00:46:44,574
Ok, now we will
reverse the play order.

607
00:46:44,647 --> 00:46:46,740
Defenders will attack
and attackers will defend.

608
00:46:47,417 --> 00:46:48,509
Sorry sir!

609
00:46:48,718 --> 00:46:51,551
Go attack! Ball on the centre.

610
00:46:53,990 --> 00:46:55,423
With all your heart! Come on!

611
00:47:13,710 --> 00:47:16,543
ln the World Cup final,
the team lost to Pakistan.

612
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:18,945
Wasn't he the team Captain?

613
00:47:19,382 --> 00:47:20,906
Captain?

614
00:47:21,684 --> 00:47:24,448
He was Pakistan's captain,
in an lndian uniform.

615
00:47:25,388 --> 00:47:26,446
What are you saying?

616
00:47:26,656 --> 00:47:28,556
lt is not only me. Everyone says so.

617
00:47:29,392 --> 00:47:30,757
So how did they make him the coach?

618
00:47:31,461 --> 00:47:33,520
This is lndia. Anything is possible.

619
00:47:33,663 --> 00:47:35,688
He mentioned taking
us to the World Cup.

620
00:47:36,566 --> 00:47:38,591
He has already
sold his country once.

621
00:47:39,402 --> 00:47:40,960
This time he may
just sell us as well!

622
00:47:45,708 --> 00:47:47,573
You guys will keep scrubbing
shoes for the rest of your life.

623
00:47:47,644 --> 00:47:49,441
Come, see who is downstairs.
- Who?

624
00:47:49,546 --> 00:47:50,672
Take a wild guess

625
00:47:51,414 --> 00:47:52,506
ls it a film star?

626
00:47:53,049 --> 00:47:54,607
Abhimanyu Singh!

627
00:47:55,418 --> 00:47:56,715
You are kidding!

628
00:47:57,420 --> 00:47:58,478
What!

629
00:47:58,555 --> 00:48:01,683
Go see for yourself. Bro
is here to meet someone.

630
00:48:01,925 --> 00:48:02,983
He maybe your 'brother'!

631
00:48:03,426 --> 00:48:05,417
But who is he here for?
Come! Let us see!

632
00:48:05,495 --> 00:48:06,860
Let us go

633
00:48:26,783 --> 00:48:29,650
She is a sly one.. did not
tell anyone she is his fianc?e..

634
00:48:30,086 --> 00:48:32,486
Coach has given her
leave till tomorrow morning..

635
00:48:32,589 --> 00:48:34,454
Wow!

636
00:48:43,766 --> 00:48:44,858
Leave till tomorrow morning.

637
00:48:45,835 --> 00:48:47,632
Why, whatever will
they do all night long?

638
00:48:54,811 --> 00:48:55,903
lt is confirmed.

639
00:48:56,012 --> 00:48:57,536
They are making me the Vice Captain.

640
00:48:57,647 --> 00:48:58,773
Bullshit!

641
00:49:00,483 --> 00:49:04,044
Really? l do not believe this!

642
00:49:05,555 --> 00:49:07,819
l knew it. How long will
these clowns hold out.

643
00:49:07,924 --> 00:49:09,983
Vice Captain of the
lndian frikkin cricket team!

644
00:49:10,126 --> 00:49:11,923
Now you watch how l
teach all these seniors.

645
00:49:12,595 --> 00:49:14,825
You see who rules this team now!

646
00:49:14,964 --> 00:49:18,127
Get out of the way everyone!
lt is my turn now.

647
00:49:21,938 --> 00:49:23,496
Why do you not quit all this now?

648
00:49:24,507 --> 00:49:25,599
Quit what?

649
00:49:26,175 --> 00:49:27,767
Your silly stick & ball game

650
00:49:29,679 --> 00:49:33,046
Come on baby, forget about it now.

651
00:49:33,516 --> 00:49:34,574
Forget about it and do what?

652
00:49:34,651 --> 00:49:37,518
Do what? Live it up!

653
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:40,013
Be with me! Travel
the world with me.

654
00:49:40,089 --> 00:49:42,114
Live life king-size, with the King.

655
00:49:42,959 --> 00:49:45,860
As the wife of the Vice
Captain of the lndian Cricket team!

656
00:49:45,928 --> 00:49:46,986
Wife?

657
00:49:47,697 --> 00:49:48,857
Oh, forgot to tell you.

658
00:49:51,167 --> 00:49:52,896
Had a chat with your dad
over drinks yesterday.

659
00:49:53,936 --> 00:49:55,563
l told him l am all for it.

660
00:49:55,638 --> 00:49:58,038
He said we do not want
to delay it anymore.

661
00:49:58,541 --> 00:49:59,940
So it is all fixed.

662
00:50:01,711 --> 00:50:03,008
Anyway, my career is all set.

663
00:50:03,079 --> 00:50:04,137
And what about my career?

664
00:50:04,547 --> 00:50:05,639
What?

665
00:50:05,715 --> 00:50:06,841
What about my career?

666
00:50:07,550 --> 00:50:09,916
What career?

667
00:50:09,986 --> 00:50:12,011
Abhi, l am in the lndian hockey team

668
00:50:12,121 --> 00:50:15,557
Yeah but that is not a career,
Preeti. That is just a stupid game.

669
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:19,052
So is cricket

670
00:50:19,195 --> 00:50:20,492
Preeti! l know you like to think of

671
00:50:20,563 --> 00:50:23,191
your little dribbling and
stick work as a big thing.

672
00:50:23,566 --> 00:50:27,627
But let us face it
- it is not exactly cricket is it?

673
00:50:42,852 --> 00:50:44,683
Look at her enjoying herself!

674
00:50:46,956 --> 00:50:48,719
Damn it, let us go play.

675
00:50:51,594 --> 00:50:54,688
Come on, we have been rotting on
this same bench for the last 7 days.

676
00:50:54,797 --> 00:50:57,664
We are players, not
Association members who sit around.

677
00:50:57,767 --> 00:51:00,895
Come on. Come on!

678
00:51:06,042 --> 00:51:07,134
l will show him my game!

679
00:51:07,210 --> 00:51:08,541
lf he is not forced to
make me a forward again,

680
00:51:08,611 --> 00:51:09,942
my name is not Bindia Naik.

681
00:51:10,913 --> 00:51:12,642
Or his is not Tuglaq.

682
00:51:20,189 --> 00:51:24,091
Sorry sir, it will not
happen again. We are sorry.

683
00:51:26,629 --> 00:51:27,721
Sorry

684
00:51:29,198 --> 00:51:31,894
Ok, you can play center half.

685
00:51:41,977 --> 00:51:45,105
Thank God sir. The
situation is under control now.

686
00:51:46,248 --> 00:51:50,708
No, Krishnaji. lt is just
about to go out of control.

687
00:51:52,687 --> 00:51:57,215
Right! Left! Right! Left!

688
00:51:58,126 --> 00:52:01,926
Faster! Faster! Faster!
Run faster! Move.

689
00:52:02,130 --> 00:52:03,757
Faster! Faster! Run faster!
l mean FAST!

690
00:52:05,167 --> 00:52:06,964
Right, left, right! To the ball!

691
00:52:07,035 --> 00:52:10,004
Ok, let's go! Right! Left!

692
00:52:11,139 --> 00:52:16,202
Pass the ball! Make a pass! Pass,
pass, pass, pass, pass, pass PASS!

693
00:52:16,278 --> 00:52:17,336
Thank you.

694
00:52:18,947 --> 00:52:22,883
Trap and pass! Move the
ball ahead! Come on, move it!

695
00:52:23,752 --> 00:52:26,016
No player will keep the
ball for more than 5 seconds.

696
00:52:26,087 --> 00:52:29,079
Can you count? 5-4-3-2-1 !

697
00:52:30,792 --> 00:52:35,195
Faster! Faster! Run faster!
l mean FAST! Quick, quick!

698
00:52:35,263 --> 00:52:36,753
Faster, faster,

699
00:52:38,967 --> 00:52:42,095
What is your problem? Do you not see
the ball, or are you afraid of it?

700
00:52:42,170 --> 00:52:43,865
Want to practice with a
tennis ball for a few days?

701
00:52:47,008 --> 00:52:52,173
Left, right, left!
Leave the ball, sit!

702
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:54,245
Go, right!

703
00:52:56,651 --> 00:52:57,709
Go to hell!

704
00:52:59,154 --> 00:53:04,091
Trap, look and pass! Stop,
look and move it ahead..

705
00:53:04,159 --> 00:53:06,252
Do not move yourself forward.
Move the ball forward!

706
00:53:06,728 --> 00:53:08,753
Do one thing pick up the ball.

707
00:53:09,898 --> 00:53:14,267
PlCK lT UP! Put it in
your pocket and go home.

708
00:53:14,870 --> 00:53:17,668
Go play on the Chandigarh team
from tomorrow. No need to play here.

709
00:53:20,075 --> 00:53:25,069
And you! What are
you so angry about?

710
00:53:25,747 --> 00:53:27,078
Raise your game first

711
00:53:27,148 --> 00:53:28,206
and then raise your voice.

712
00:53:28,283 --> 00:53:30,979
Once more if l hear you shout out,

713
00:53:31,319 --> 00:53:32,684
you will be out!

714
00:53:40,929 --> 00:53:43,727
Hey you! Why are
you the center half?

715
00:53:44,132 --> 00:53:46,066
Because you are the senior
most player in the team.

716
00:53:46,134 --> 00:53:49,262
Your job is not to push the
forward line but to teach them.

717
00:53:50,438 --> 00:53:51,837
And one more thing.

718
00:53:53,074 --> 00:53:55,736
There can only be one
bully in every team.

719
00:53:56,711 --> 00:53:59,339
And for this team, it is me.

720
00:54:06,288 --> 00:54:08,188
You! Call this a pass?

721
00:54:09,891 --> 00:54:11,791
You are only good enough to
plough fields in your village.

722
00:54:11,860 --> 00:54:13,088
Forget about hockey!

723
00:54:14,729 --> 00:54:16,754
And why are you standing around?
Go get the ball!

724
00:54:19,467 --> 00:54:22,834
Right, left, right,

725
00:54:22,904 --> 00:54:28,103
left, right, left! Relax!

726
00:54:28,376 --> 00:54:29,434
Nethra!

727
00:54:33,748 --> 00:54:37,275
Krishnaji! Give her water
and take her out! Quickly!

728
00:54:42,257 --> 00:54:46,387
So! You are lndia's best players!

729
00:54:47,362 --> 00:54:49,489
You will go to the
World Championship! Hah!

730
00:54:49,564 --> 00:54:51,429
To raise lndia's flag!

731
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:55,997
The Association is right.

732
00:54:56,338 --> 00:54:59,000
How will this lot ever play hockey!

733
00:55:00,208 --> 00:55:01,766
They cannot play as
one team. How the hell..

734
00:55:01,843 --> 00:55:02,901
..will they ever win
a World Championship!

735
00:55:03,378 --> 00:55:06,142
What are you staring at?
She is unconscious not dead!

736
00:55:07,015 --> 00:55:08,778
Krishnaji! Take her away! Out!

737
00:55:12,954 --> 00:55:14,148
l had said it on the first day.

738
00:55:15,056 --> 00:55:20,153
This team needs only those
who first play for lndia,

739
00:55:20,395 --> 00:55:23,296
then for their team mates

740
00:55:23,531 --> 00:55:27,490
and then if there is any
life left, for themselves.

741
00:55:29,304 --> 00:55:30,532
Let's start again.

742
00:55:32,974 --> 00:55:34,032
Right!

743
00:56:11,079 --> 00:56:13,309
So! Did you see what happens when
you let the coach think he is God!

744
00:56:17,052 --> 00:56:18,383
The blood will not stop.

745
00:56:19,988 --> 00:56:21,455
l warned you guys.

746
00:56:26,261 --> 00:56:27,319
Do you want to eat something?

747
00:56:30,298 --> 00:56:35,235
Wake up at 4am, run for 20 km. And
on the field, he does not let us play.

748
00:56:36,137 --> 00:56:37,195
What kind of a camp is this?

749
00:56:37,272 --> 00:56:38,330
Does it hurt a lot?

750
00:56:39,874 --> 00:56:40,966
Here! lt hurts here.

751
00:56:42,110 --> 00:56:43,509
He insulted us!

752
00:56:44,546 --> 00:56:45,604
Hit with the ball!

753
00:56:46,514 --> 00:56:48,914
He knows damn well you
cannot speak English.

754
00:56:48,983 --> 00:56:50,245
But you have to learn it!

755
00:56:50,318 --> 00:56:52,616
What you have not learnt in your
whole life, learn it in a day!

756
00:56:53,054 --> 00:56:54,112
Else get out of the team.

757
00:56:54,189 --> 00:56:55,417
Hey, he cannot throw you out!

758
00:56:55,523 --> 00:56:59,482
Do not worry, l will teach you.

759
00:56:59,994 --> 00:57:01,393
How can he cut you out of the team?

760
00:57:01,463 --> 00:57:03,454
What do you say Aliya?

761
00:57:04,165 --> 00:57:08,898
No freedom to eat, to move around
and when we play, he insults us.

762
00:57:10,271 --> 00:57:14,139
This is not a primary school. Each
girl is a National level player.

763
00:57:14,209 --> 00:57:16,575
A champion from her state
- that is why she is here.

764
00:57:17,078 --> 00:57:19,273
lf there is any failure
amongst us, lt is him.

765
00:57:19,914 --> 00:57:21,404
Sold his team out in the World Cup!

766
00:57:22,016 --> 00:57:23,574
Was thrown out of
the team, the country.

767
00:57:25,487 --> 00:57:27,478
What else can l say? l am
ashamed to say any more.

768
00:57:29,057 --> 00:57:30,183
Does it hurt?

769
00:57:33,261 --> 00:57:34,660
l have a spray..

770
00:57:40,468 --> 00:57:41,560
How is Nethra?

771
00:57:42,437 --> 00:57:46,464
OK. The doctor says she will be
back to practice in a couple of days.

772
00:57:47,976 --> 00:57:51,002
Practice? Have you lost it?

773
00:57:52,247 --> 00:57:53,578
From now on, there
will be no practice!

774
00:57:54,349 --> 00:57:56,613
There will be no
practice from tomorrow!

775
00:57:57,185 --> 00:57:58,243
Look here..

776
00:57:58,319 --> 00:58:04,690
You look here! We know you like him

777
00:58:05,193 --> 00:58:09,323
but you should also realise
that the team is on this side.

778
00:58:14,068 --> 00:58:16,127
lt is time you choose
which side you're on.

779
00:58:17,071 --> 00:58:18,129
Yes.

780
00:58:19,207 --> 00:58:20,265
Definitely.

781
00:58:23,378 --> 00:58:24,538
l have thought about it.

782
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:29,473
Now only the Association can
decide how this team should run.

783
00:58:30,351 --> 00:58:32,478
The way teams have
always run in this country.

784
00:58:33,254 --> 00:58:35,484
Or the way Tuglaq wants it!

785
00:58:43,731 --> 00:58:46,598
Let us sign this.

786
00:58:49,170 --> 00:58:54,005
Now, it is either
the Coach or our team.

787
00:58:56,511 --> 00:58:57,603
Sign this, Gul!

788
00:59:21,102 --> 00:59:22,160
Sir..

789
00:59:23,338 --> 00:59:25,306
Hmmm? Have some..

790
00:59:27,442 --> 00:59:28,704
Wasn't that too much?

791
00:59:32,046 --> 00:59:35,140
They are girls after all.
How much can you push them?

792
00:59:36,150 --> 00:59:38,050
lf you look for the
strength of boys..

793
00:59:38,119 --> 00:59:40,587
l am not looking for strength.
l am looking for team spirit.

794
00:59:41,789 --> 00:59:44,417
You do not need strength to make
a team. You need team spirit.

795
00:59:46,060 --> 00:59:49,689
But sir, at this rate, you
will become their enemy.

796
00:59:50,231 --> 00:59:54,065
lf by making me an enemy
they can become a team,

797
00:59:55,069 --> 00:59:57,333
then it is a small
price to pay, Krishnaji.

798
01:00:14,355 --> 01:00:15,686
Why are you not on the field?

799
01:00:18,092 --> 01:00:19,150
What is the matter?

800
01:00:21,195 --> 01:00:23,220
The team does not want
to practice with you.

801
01:00:23,631 --> 01:00:25,258
What rubbish!

802
01:00:28,102 --> 01:00:29,660
We want a new coach.

803
01:00:30,271 --> 01:00:31,670
l will give you one -

804
01:00:31,739 --> 01:00:34,469
Why Krishnaji? Why will you hit us?

805
01:00:35,109 --> 01:00:36,508
We are not the ones
who sold our country!

806
01:00:36,711 --> 01:00:38,235
Quiet!
- Sir!

807
01:00:47,722 --> 01:00:48,780
7 years.

808
01:00:50,625 --> 01:00:53,617
After 7 years l came back to hockey,
with the belief that this time

809
01:00:54,395 --> 01:00:59,230
l will beat the one thing that
defeated my team once and for all.

810
01:01:01,502 --> 01:01:05,131
But today, once again,
l have lost to it.

811
01:01:07,809 --> 01:01:10,744
You do not have a problem with me.

812
01:01:12,413 --> 01:01:14,210
You have a problem

813
01:01:15,550 --> 01:01:17,279
with the fact that instead of
making you play against each other,

814
01:01:17,352 --> 01:01:19,411
l am forcing you to
play with one another.

815
01:01:20,154 --> 01:01:21,280
Because l have forced
you to think about..

816
01:01:21,356 --> 01:01:23,187
..your team before you
think about yourself.

817
01:01:23,591 --> 01:01:27,152
Forced you to play for lndia
before you play for your own state.

818
01:01:30,398 --> 01:01:38,828
Fine. You have won. l have lost.

819
01:01:42,610 --> 01:01:45,670
But l am not sorry loosing to you.

820
01:01:46,647 --> 01:01:52,415
l am sorry l have
lost to my country.

821
01:01:54,188 --> 01:01:58,181
Which even after taking my blood,
sweat, my love,..

822
01:01:58,259 --> 01:02:02,855
..my life, does not believe
that l played for it once.

823
01:02:03,731 --> 01:02:06,666
And l will play for it all my life.

824
01:02:11,406 --> 01:02:14,569
l resign as the coach of this team.

825
01:03:09,964 --> 01:03:11,454
Please, just think it over, Sir.

826
01:03:19,674 --> 01:03:21,665
You have worked so hard.

827
01:03:44,365 --> 01:03:46,799
Today is my last day in this camp.

828
01:03:49,437 --> 01:03:52,429
Before l leave, l am
taking the staff out for lunch.

829
01:03:53,674 --> 01:03:55,938
You are welcome to
join us if you wish.

830
01:03:59,881 --> 01:04:02,509
No obligations.

831
01:05:11,619 --> 01:05:15,715
Hi beautiful! Come on,
join us babes! Hey come on!

832
01:05:19,427 --> 01:05:23,557
She's red hot ya! Hey baby, hey!

833
01:05:29,570 --> 01:05:31,470
Harassing girls, are you? Try it!

834
01:05:31,539 --> 01:05:33,530
Hey! Hey, how..

835
01:05:34,508 --> 01:05:35,566
Balbir!

836
01:05:39,447 --> 01:05:41,779
Hit him!

837
01:06:46,013 --> 01:06:47,071
Do not let him go!

838
01:07:09,203 --> 01:07:12,001
Not from behind. Have guts
to attack from the front.

839
01:07:13,741 --> 01:07:18,041
You see, in hockey
there are no cowards.

840
01:07:44,171 --> 01:07:46,105
ls this a team or an army of devils?

841
01:07:47,808 --> 01:07:49,605
l told you, Krishnaji.

842
01:07:49,677 --> 01:07:53,773
lt is not strength, but
spirit that makes a team.

843
01:07:55,649 --> 01:07:58,914
For the first time, l
have seen team spirit.

844
01:08:33,154 --> 01:08:38,683
Sir.. l was just..
just trying to say that..

845
01:08:40,127 --> 01:08:46,032
l mean.. let
sleeping dogs lie.. l mean..

846
01:08:47,067 --> 01:08:48,227
Hey tell him!

847
01:08:49,303 --> 01:08:54,138
Sir what she means.. what we all

848
01:09:08,155 --> 01:09:09,679
Tomorrow morning, 5 am sharp.

849
01:09:11,091 --> 01:09:14,720
l want everyone on the field.

850
01:09:19,967 --> 01:09:29,000
Chak De! lndia (Go lndia!)

851
01:09:57,533 --> 01:09:58,591
Come, come, come.

852
01:09:59,201 --> 01:10:01,635
We will run two
more kilometers today.

853
01:10:01,703 --> 01:10:02,761
Come on guys!

854
01:10:17,119 --> 01:10:19,110
Do something, do something

855
01:10:19,188 --> 01:10:21,452
My veins are bursting

856
01:10:21,523 --> 01:10:22,751
O please do something

857
01:10:26,061 --> 01:10:28,222
Do something, do something

858
01:10:28,297 --> 01:10:30,561
For talk and sermons bite the dust

859
01:10:30,632 --> 01:10:32,224
lt is time to do something

860
01:10:34,770 --> 01:10:36,738
Be stubborn if that is what it takes

861
01:10:36,805 --> 01:10:39,239
Do or die
- all is at stake!

862
01:10:44,613 --> 01:10:49,209
Chak De! lndia (Go lndia!)

863
01:11:12,107 --> 01:11:16,601
ln the fighting kite,
in the riot of might

864
01:11:16,678 --> 01:11:21,172
ln the games and the fair,
in the bumpy trains so bare

865
01:11:21,250 --> 01:11:26,119
ln the sweetness of sugarcane,
in the clothes of the rich or vain

866
01:11:26,188 --> 01:11:30,352
Seek and you will find,
heat that bricks bind

867
01:11:30,425 --> 01:11:34,486
A colour has emerged, and
it is spreading converged

868
01:11:34,563 --> 01:11:39,296
This colour of the reign,
is embedded in your veins

869
01:11:39,368 --> 01:11:43,737
Stand immovable, invincible,
obstinate in times of trouble

870
01:11:43,805 --> 01:11:52,179
Scraped and scarred,
move on even if marred

871
01:11:52,247 --> 01:11:54,579
Be stubborn if that is what it takes

872
01:11:54,650 --> 01:11:56,777
Do or die
- all is at stake!

873
01:12:02,591 --> 01:12:06,687
Chak De! lndia (Go lndia!)

874
01:12:30,385 --> 01:12:31,443
How can you go?

875
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:32,578
Why?

876
01:12:33,188 --> 01:12:34,416
Because we are getting married!

877
01:12:34,523 --> 01:12:35,581
What?

878
01:12:35,757 --> 01:12:38,555
You can not go on the 25th, we
are getting married on the 2nd

879
01:12:38,627 --> 01:12:39,685
What?

880
01:12:39,761 --> 01:12:41,422
l have fixed the dates after
discussing it with your parents

881
01:12:41,496 --> 01:12:43,191
And me? Do you not need
to discuss this with me?

882
01:12:43,265 --> 01:12:44,357
What is the point of discussing it?

883
01:12:44,433 --> 01:12:45,900
You want to get
married to me, do you not?

884
01:12:47,235 --> 01:12:49,465
But, not like this! l need time.

885
01:12:49,538 --> 01:12:50,630
What for?

886
01:12:50,706 --> 01:12:52,196
l am playing for
the World Cup, Abhi!

887
01:12:52,274 --> 01:12:54,208
Have you gone insane?

888
01:12:54,509 --> 01:12:56,670
You want to postpone our
wedding for the World Cup?

889
01:12:57,579 --> 01:12:59,444
What if it was your World cup?

890
01:12:59,514 --> 01:13:00,776
That is a totally different.

891
01:13:00,849 --> 01:13:02,339
lt is the Cricket World cup.

892
01:13:02,417 --> 01:13:03,509
lt is really important.

893
01:13:04,686 --> 01:13:06,745
This is really important.. for me

894
01:13:06,822 --> 01:13:08,380
More important than our marriage?

895
01:13:09,391 --> 01:13:10,722
l have to go. Good night!

896
01:13:12,928 --> 01:13:15,396
Go. Go play the World cup..

897
01:13:15,464 --> 01:13:17,864
lf you loose you
will become my wife.

898
01:13:18,333 --> 01:13:20,961
lf you win, you
will become my wife..

899
01:13:21,703 --> 01:13:23,227
lt is not like when you come back,

900
01:13:23,305 --> 01:13:26,797
the whole country
will remember your name.

901
01:13:29,277 --> 01:13:31,404
One thing l promise
you Mr. Abhimanyu..

902
01:13:31,847 --> 01:13:33,940
This will definitely happen.

903
01:13:38,854 --> 01:13:40,549
The team is shaping up well, sir.

904
01:13:41,556 --> 01:13:42,682
The captain of this
team will be Vidya.

905
01:13:45,761 --> 01:13:46,955
Congratulations, Vidya!

906
01:13:59,441 --> 01:14:00,567
Give it a break.

907
01:14:00,876 --> 01:14:02,366
l have nothing to say to you.

908
01:14:02,677 --> 01:14:05,271
For the first time something
good is happening. Take part in it.

909
01:14:05,347 --> 01:14:06,405
You already did!

910
01:14:10,452 --> 01:14:12,352
The way Bindia is using her brain..

911
01:14:12,821 --> 01:14:14,846
Do you think it is right
for her to be on the team?

912
01:14:15,924 --> 01:14:18,290
l do not know Krishnaji..
but it is also not right..

913
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:21,488
..to keep the most
experienced player off the team.

914
01:14:22,364 --> 01:14:24,696
l do not think we can..
deal with her

915
01:14:26,802 --> 01:14:29,737
We cannot win without her either.

916
01:14:31,640 --> 01:14:34,336
ls this not your
World Cup silver medal?

917
01:14:35,877 --> 01:14:36,935
What are you doing with it?

918
01:14:39,014 --> 01:14:41,448
Trying to scrub it into gold.

919
01:14:43,485 --> 01:14:45,715
lf l ever need to sell
it in the flea market,

920
01:14:46,721 --> 01:14:47,915
at least l will get a good price.

921
01:14:53,595 --> 01:14:59,056
Mr. Kabir, it is best if you
forget about the World Cup.

922
01:15:00,335 --> 01:15:01,893
And tell these girls as well.

923
01:15:01,970 --> 01:15:03,699
The ones who you have
given such high hopes too.

924
01:15:04,906 --> 01:15:07,841
But our deal was to train
this team for the World Cup.

925
01:15:09,010 --> 01:15:12,810
lt was not like we signed on a legal
document you cannot hold us up to it.

926
01:15:12,948 --> 01:15:15,041
You discussed it in
front of me, Mr. Tripathi.

927
01:15:15,784 --> 01:15:17,775
We will discuss it in
front of you once more.

928
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:20,647
Look, on one hand,

929
01:15:20,722 --> 01:15:24,488
there is the lndian men's team
which at least gets a bronze medal.

930
01:15:24,993 --> 01:15:27,484
And on the other, there
is this team of misfits.

931
01:15:27,896 --> 01:15:31,059
But this team is
ready for the World Cup!

932
01:15:31,666 --> 01:15:34,567
Tomorrow if they are ready for
the moon, we should send them? Huh?

933
01:15:34,836 --> 01:15:36,599
This team can not go the World Cup.

934
01:15:36,671 --> 01:15:37,729
lt is decided.

935
01:15:38,406 --> 01:15:40,374
Be honest. Tell us
you are taking money..

936
01:15:40,442 --> 01:15:42,967
..from the Women's team
to give to the Men's team.

937
01:15:44,446 --> 01:15:45,811
You guys are athletes.

938
01:15:46,581 --> 01:15:49,607
Why do you want to get involved
in things that do not concern you?

939
01:15:50,719 --> 01:15:51,777
Shall we?

940
01:15:52,687 --> 01:15:53,745
But Mr. Tripathi!

941
01:15:55,390 --> 01:15:58,086
Let us have a match.

942
01:15:58,159 --> 01:15:59,387
What?

943
01:16:01,796 --> 01:16:06,460
Yes. Let us have a match.
Between my team and your team.

944
01:16:07,536 --> 01:16:10,403
You mean Men's
team v/s Women's team?

945
01:16:12,007 --> 01:16:14,601
l mean between my
team and your team.

946
01:16:17,546 --> 01:16:21,505
lf we loose, we loose. But
if we win, then - World Cup.

947
01:16:24,586 --> 01:16:26,053
Think about what you
are saying, Mr. Kabir.

948
01:16:26,655 --> 01:16:29,522
Do not make Pandavas' (lndian
mythological characters) bet

949
01:16:29,824 --> 01:16:31,621
You will be left standing naked.

950
01:16:31,693 --> 01:16:33,718
lt has already happened to you once.

951
01:16:36,731 --> 01:16:39,632
All right. Day after morning.

952
01:16:40,635 --> 01:16:42,865
But we need time to train!

953
01:16:42,938 --> 01:16:45,634
Day after
- yes or no?

954
01:16:45,707 --> 01:16:46,765
Mr. Tripathi..

955
01:16:46,841 --> 01:16:48,706
Day after morning. We
will meet on the field.

956
01:16:54,849 --> 01:16:56,874
Even your team needs to practice

957
01:16:56,952 --> 01:16:58,010
Come out..

958
01:17:09,831 --> 01:17:10,889
Shit!

959
01:17:11,800 --> 01:17:14,769
We will never win. And
by some chance, if we do..

960
01:17:14,836 --> 01:17:18,033
Chance! Huh!

961
01:17:19,107 --> 01:17:21,473
lmagine how many
goals we will loose by.

962
01:17:21,543 --> 01:17:24,512
And once we lose,
it is over forever!

963
01:17:29,985 --> 01:17:31,213
What have you done, sir?

964
01:17:31,286 --> 01:17:32,981
We are like sitting ducks.

965
01:17:33,054 --> 01:17:38,014
Ducks? l have belief in this team.

966
01:17:38,693 --> 01:17:40,490
Does this team believe in itself?

967
01:17:41,696 --> 01:17:43,527
Come on! Let us go.

968
01:17:47,135 --> 01:17:52,596
Look, you are not
playing against these boys.

969
01:17:52,674 --> 01:17:54,539
Come on, get ready! Hurry!

970
01:17:57,178 --> 01:17:58,736
Do not think
- here let me have it.
