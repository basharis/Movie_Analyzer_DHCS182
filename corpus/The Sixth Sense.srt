- lt's getting cold.
- Thanks.

00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:17,756
That is one fine frame.

00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:20,884
One fine frame, that is.

00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:24,596
How much...

10
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:30,811
...does a fine frame
like that cost, do you think?

11
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,730
l never told you,

12
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:36,942
but you sound a little like
Dr. Seuss when you're drunk.

13
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:39,027
Anna, l'm serious.

14
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:42,197
Serious, l am, Anna.

15
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:47,327
l'd say it cost
at least a couple hundred.

16
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,746
l'm gonna read it for you.

17
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:51,581
Do l really sound like Dr. Seuss?

Wow.

30
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:32,456
We should hang it in the bathroom.

00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:38,211
This is an important night for us.

32
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:44,092
Finally, someone is recognizing
the sacrifices you've made.

33
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:48,221
That you have put everything

...for those families
that they're talking about.

35

They're also saying
that my husband has a gift.

36
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:03,820
You have a gift that teaches
children how to be strong

37
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:08,617
in situations where most adults
would piss on themselves.

38
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:11,536
l believe what they wrote is real.

39
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,501
Thank you.

l do. l do.

57
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:21,249
What do you want?

58
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,043
What he promised me!

59
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:26,546

- Oh, my God.

Don't you know me, hero?

00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:54,699
You told me l was having trouble
coping with my parents' divorce.

You were wrong.

00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:03,833
Now look at me!

00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:06,127
l don't want to be afraid no more.

Don't. Don't.

You failed me!

We were supposed to meet today,
but l missed our appointment.

l'm sorry.

104
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:20,757
You know,
in the olden days in Europe,

105
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:22,884
people used to hide out in churches.

106
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:25,804
They would claim sanctuary.

107
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:32,852
What were they hiding from?

108
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:38,483
Bad people, mostly.

109
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:43,321
People that wanted to put
them in jail... hurt them.

110
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:49,577
Noticed your eyeglasses. They
don't have any lenses in them.

111
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,830
They're my dad's.

112
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:54,374
The lenses hurt my eyes.

113
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:57,418
What were you talking
about with your soldiers

114
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:59,379
when l came in?

115
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:04,300
- De...
- De profundis clamo ad te, Domine.

116
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:06,386
lt's called "Latin."

117
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:12,600
All your soldiers speak Latin?

118
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,352
No.

119
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:16,271
Just one.

120
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,276
Are you a good doctor?

121
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,194
Well...

l won an award once
from the mayor.

124
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:33,997
Had an expensive frame.

125
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:50,346
l'm gonna see you again, right?

126
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:53,182

00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:46,481
Hey, your Cocoa Puffs
are getting soggy.

136
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:52,487
Let me see you.
Aw, honey, you got a spot.

137
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:03,498
OK, here it comes.

They're right here.

142
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:30,817
Oh.

143
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:39,492
What are you thinking, Mama?

144
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,371
Lots of things.

145
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:46,874
Anything bad about me?

146
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:48,918
Hey, look at my face.

147
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:52,880
l was not thinking
something bad about you.

148
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:55,883
Got it?

149
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,971
Got it.

150
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:03,391
- Get up.
- [bell rings]

151
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:05,893
- Th... that's Tommy, Mom.
- OK, you tuck it in.

152
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:08,479
Hey, Cole? You want this?

153
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:42,180
Hey, freak, how'd you like that
arm-around-the-shoulder bit?

154
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:46,225
l just made that up. l went
with it as great actors do.

155
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:48,269
lt's called "improv."

00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:28,142
Hey, baby.

158
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:30,978
How was your day?

159
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:34,315
Hmm?

160
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,905
You know, you can
tell me things if you need to.

161
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:48,955
Oh, you know what l did today?

162
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:53,668
l, uh... l won the Pennsylvania
Lottery in the morning.

163
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:56,504
l quit my jobs.

164
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:59,507
And l ate a big picnic in the park

165
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:01,342
with lots of chocolate mousse pie.

166
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:05,012
And then l swam
in the fountain all afternoon.

167
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:07,056
What'd you do?

168
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:15,523
l was picked first for
kickball teams at recess.

169
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:17,942
l hit a grand slam to win the game.

170
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:21,862
Everybody lifted me up
and carried me around, cheering.

171
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:29,996
ln that case, l am gonna
make you some triangle pancakes.

172
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:32,206
You got an hour.

173
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:40,131
Hi.

00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:47,471
Want to sit?

175
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:53,853
Don't feel like talking today?

176
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:00,026
Wanna play a game?

177
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:03,946
lt's a mind-reading game.

178
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:05,865
Here's how it works:

179
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:08,242
l read your mind.

180
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:11,912
lf what l say is right, you
take one step towards the chair.

181
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:14,081
lf what l say is wrong,

182
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:17,084
you take one step back
towards the doorway.

183
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:21,380
lf you reach the chair,
you sit down.

184
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:24,675
lf you reach the door, you can go.

185
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,679
Wanna play?

186
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:38,314
OK.

187
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,781
[humming]

188
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:57,166
When your mother and father
were first divorced,

189
00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:01,796
your mom went to see a doctor
like me, and he didn't help her,

190
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:05,216
so you think l'm not
going to be able to help you.

191
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:25,194
You're worried that
she said she told him things,

192
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:27,780
things she couldn't tell anyone else.

193
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:31,409
Secrets.

194
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:40,876
You have a secret,
but you don't want to tell me.

195
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:56,267
Your dad gave you
that watch as a present

196
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:58,352
just before he went away.

197
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:11,574
He forgot it in a drawer.

198
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:13,659
Doesn't work.

199
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:28,591
You keep pretty quiet
in school, but...

200
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:30,676
...you're a good student.

201
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:34,054
You've never really been
in any serious trouble.

202
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:43,272
We were supposed
to draw a picture.

203
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:45,357
Anything we wanted.

204
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:50,738
l drew a man...

205
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:54,492
...got hurt in the neck by
another man with a screwdriver.

206
00:24:57,829 --> 00:24:59,997
You saw that on TV, Cole?

207
00:25:04,377 --> 00:25:06,629
Everyone got upset.

208
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:10,466
They had a meeting.

209
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,676
Mom started crying.

210
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:15,596
l don't draw like that anymore.

211
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:19,517
How do you draw now?

212
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:24,855
Draw... people smiling...

213
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,941
...dogs running...

214
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:30,152
...rainbows.

215
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,948
They don't have
meetings about rainbows.

216
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:37,618
No.

217
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:39,745
l guess they don't.

218
00:25:47,837 --> 00:25:50,756
What am l thinking now?

219
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,467
l don't know what you're thinking now.

220
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:02,560
l was thinking,

221
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:04,645
you're nice...

222
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:09,233
...but you can't help me.

223
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:24,415
[sighs]

224
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:27,501
l thought you meant
the other ltalian restaurant

225
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:29,503
l asked you to marry me in.

226
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:35,968
[sighs]

227
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:38,012
l'm so sorry, Anna.

228
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:42,057
l just can't seem to keep track of time.

229
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:47,813
And l didn't have
a very good session today. l...

230
00:26:50,525 --> 00:26:52,151
[sighs]

231
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:55,070
They're both so similar.

232
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:58,032
Same mannerisms,
same expressions, same...

233
00:26:58,074 --> 00:27:00,409
...things hanging over their head.

234
00:27:02,912 --> 00:27:05,247
l think it might be some kind of abuse.

235
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:10,210
Cole has... scratches on his arm.

236
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:12,671
l think they might be fingernail cuts.

237
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:15,841
Defensive cuts, maybe.
l don't know, Anna.

238
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:17,509
[sighs]

239
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:19,887
Maybe a teacher or a neighbor.

240
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:23,474
l don't think it's the mother.
l've seen her with him, and...

241
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:25,559
...doesn't seem to fit.

242
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:30,314
Or l could just be wrong.

243
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:33,567
Maybe he's just a kid who
likes to climb trees a lot.

244
00:27:41,951 --> 00:27:44,119
[sighs] Anna...

245
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:49,083
l know that l've been
a little distant. l...

246
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:51,543
l know that it makes
you mad. l just...

247
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:54,004
...feel like l'm being
given a second chance

248
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:56,256
and l don't want it to slip away.

249
00:27:58,093 --> 00:27:59,927
Anna.

250
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:03,097
Happy anniversary.

251
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:12,606
[sighs]

252
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:15,067
[Cole] Stop looking at me.

253
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:17,903
l don't like when people
look at me like that.

254
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:19,613
OK.

255
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:24,284
l walk this way to school
with Tommy Tammisimo.

256
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:26,370
He your best buddy?

257
00:28:26,454 --> 00:28:28,455
He hates me.

258
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:30,958
Do you hate him?

259
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,668
No.

260
00:28:34,587 --> 00:28:36,839
Did your mom set that up?

261
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:38,590
Yes.

262
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:43,554
Did you ever talk to your mom
about how things are with Tommy?

263
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:45,889
- l don't tell her things.
- Why not?

264
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:49,017
She doesn't look at me like
everybody else. l don't want her to.

265
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:51,979
- l don't want her to know.
- Know what?

266
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:54,440
That l'm a freak.

267
00:28:54,482 --> 00:28:56,650
Hey.

268
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:59,611
You are not a freak. OK?

269
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:02,990
Don't you believe anybody that
tries to convince you of that.

270
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:05,325
That's bullshit!

271
00:29:05,368 --> 00:29:08,704
You don't have to go through
your life believing that.

272
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:11,373
OK?

273
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:15,961
Come on.

274
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:20,799
You said the "S" word.

275
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:23,302
Yeah, l know.

276
00:29:23,344 --> 00:29:25,012
Sorry.

277
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:30,100
[music plays over headphones]

278
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:36,834
[Malcolm] Your Dad lives in Pittsburg
with a lady that works in a tollbooth?

279
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:42,673
[Cole] What if she has
to pee when she's working?

280
00:30:42,757 --> 00:30:44,925
Think she just holds it?

281
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:48,637
l don't know. l was just
thinking about that myself.

282
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:54,434
You asked a lot of questions
about Dad today. How come?

283
00:30:54,477 --> 00:30:58,522
Well... sometimes we do
things to draw attention,

284
00:30:58,606 --> 00:31:03,193
to express our feelings
about certain issues, uh,

285
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:05,988
divorce, whatever.

286
00:31:06,072 --> 00:31:09,199
For example, a person might
leave something on a desk

287
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:11,034
for someone else to find.

288
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:19,042
Do you know what
free-association writing is, Cole?

289
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:20,878
[Cole] No.

290
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:25,841
[Malcolm] Free-association writing is
when you take a pencil in your hand

291
00:31:25,925 --> 00:31:30,387
and you put the pencil to a piece
of paper and you start writing.

292
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:34,141
You don't look at what you're writing
or think about what you're writing.

293
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:37,227
You just... keep your hand moving.

294
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:39,062
And after a while,

295
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:42,274
if you keep your hand moving
long enough, words and thoughts

296
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:45,944
start coming out that you
didn't even know you had in you.

297
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:50,574
Could be... something
you heard somewhere else, or...

298
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:53,827
...feelings you had
deep inside of you.

299
00:31:57,165 --> 00:32:00,584
Have you ever done any
free-association writing, Cole?

300
00:32:03,796 --> 00:32:05,547
Yes.

301
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:08,133
What did you write?

302
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:11,428
Upset words.

303
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:16,558
Did you ever write any upset
words before your father left?

304
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:20,187
l don't remember.

305
00:32:21,856 --> 00:32:23,857
Can you do something for me?

306
00:32:25,693 --> 00:32:27,444
l want you to

307
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:30,405
think about what you want
to get out of our time together,

308
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:32,491
what our goals should be.

309
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:35,661
Something l want?

310
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:39,706
lf you could change something
in your life, anything,

311
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:41,124
what would it be?

312
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:43,043
lnstead of something l want,

313
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:45,545
can it be something l don't want?

314
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:49,174
OK.

315
00:32:49,884 --> 00:32:52,135
l don't want to be scared anymore.

316
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:01,019
[knocking]

317
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:06,984
[Malcolm] You gonna get that?

318
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:10,570
[knocking]

319
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:15,659
Are you gonna get that?

320
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:19,913
- [footsteps]
- [door opens]

321
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:21,915
- [Anna] Hey.
- [man] Hi.

322
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,292
[Anna] Don't you see
enough of me at the store?

323
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:28,255
[man] l'm on my way out to the flea
market in the Amish country. l thought

324
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:32,092
you'd wanna come along and show me
how to buy at one of these things.

325
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:35,012
[Anna] l don't know if l can
deal with the Amish today.

326
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:38,098
You can't curse or spit
or anything around them.

327
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:41,268
[man] l just figured maybe
you just wanted to get some air

328
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:43,729
because you'd seemed
kind of down lately.

329
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:48,316
[Anna] Um... l'm OK.

330
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:51,945
[man] All right. Do you think that
l should stop by on my way back

331
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:55,449
and show you what l got?
'Cause that wouldn't be a problem.

332
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:58,952
[Anna] No. l... You know,
l can see 'em on Monday.

333
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:01,455
[man] Sure. Yeah,
that's fine. Understood.

334
00:34:01,497 --> 00:34:03,790
OK, so l guess
l'm gonna get going then,

335
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:05,834
- and l'll speak to you later.
- [Anna] OK.

336
00:34:05,918 --> 00:34:08,712
- Don't step in horse manure.
- [man] Thank you very much.

337
00:34:08,796 --> 00:34:10,714
[both chuckle]

338
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:12,799
[door shuts]

339
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:20,432
Keep moving, cheese-dick.

340
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:47,167
Can anybody guess what city

341
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:49,544
was capital
of the United States ofAmerica

342
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:53,799
from 1790 to 1800?

343
00:34:56,803 --> 00:35:00,514
l'll give you a hint:
lt's the city you live in.

344
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:02,849
- [kids] Philadelphia.
- Right, right.

345
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:06,019
Philadelphia's one of the
oldest cities in this country.

346
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:08,814
A lot of generations have
lived here and died here.

347
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:11,108
Almost any place you go in this city

348
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:13,485
has a history and a story behind it.

349
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:16,530
Even this school
and the grounds it sits on.

350
00:35:16,572 --> 00:35:19,991
Can anyone guess what
this building was used for

351
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:22,452
a hundred years ago,
before you went to school here,

352
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:25,580
before l went to this school, even?

353
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:27,666
[kids whispering]

354
00:35:32,713 --> 00:35:34,714
Yes. Cole.

355
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:39,094
They used to hang people here.

356
00:35:39,178 --> 00:35:40,637
[chalk screeches]

357
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:45,809
No. Uh, that...
Mm-mmm. That's not correct.

358
00:35:45,893 --> 00:35:47,477
Uh, where'd you hear that?

359
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:49,563
They'd pull the people in,

360
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:52,482
crying and kissing their families bye.

361
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:56,611
People watching... spit at them.

362
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:01,867
U-Uh, Cole, this-this building
was a legal courthouse.

363
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:03,702
Laws were passed here,

364
00:36:03,744 --> 00:36:05,996
some of the very first laws
of this country.

365
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:09,249
This whole building was
full of lawyers, lawmakers.

366
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:11,835
They were the ones
that hanged everybody.

367
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:13,795
[kids giggling]

368
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,297
Um...

369
00:36:15,381 --> 00:36:18,592
l don't... l don't know which
one of these guys told you that,

370
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:22,012
but, um... they were
just trying to scare you.

371
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:34,858
l don't like people
looking at me like that.

372
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:38,153
Like what?

373
00:36:38,237 --> 00:36:40,322
Stop it!

374
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:43,867
l, uh... l-l-l don't
know how else to look.

375
00:36:45,244 --> 00:36:47,245
You're Stuttering Stanley!

376
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:51,499
Excuse me?

377
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:55,795
You talked funny when you went to school
here. You talked funny into high school.

378
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,298
- What?
- You shouldn't look at people.

379
00:36:58,382 --> 00:36:59,966
lt makes them feel bad.

380
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:02,010
- How did you...
- Stop looking at me!

381
00:37:02,094 --> 00:37:05,388
Who have you...
b-b-been speaking-ing to?

382
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:08,725
Stuttering Stanley!
Stuttering Stanley!

383
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:11,061
- Stop it.
- Stuttering Stanley!

384
00:37:11,145 --> 00:37:13,396
- S-S-Stop... Stop that!
- Stuttering Stanley!

385
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:16,483
- Stuttering Stanley!
- S-S-Stop it.

386
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:18,985
Stuttering Stanley!
Stuttering Stanley!

387
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:22,322
Shut up, you f-f-f-freak!

388
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:39,256
Hey, big guy.

389
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:45,345
How's it going?

390
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:48,348
l don't wanna talk
about anything right now.

391
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:50,225
OK.

392
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:54,688
[children playing outside]

393
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:07,033
You like magic?

394
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:09,911
Hmm?

395
00:38:13,165 --> 00:38:17,043
Observe: the magic penny.

396
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:20,046
Looks like an ordinary penny.

397
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:22,465
But l do my little magic shake, and...

398
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:26,511
...now it's in my right hand.

399
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:29,723
But that's not the end
of the magic trick.

400
00:38:29,765 --> 00:38:32,392
l do another little shake, and...

401
00:38:34,895 --> 00:38:37,063
...right there in the vest pocket.

402
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,817
But that's not the end
of the magic trick.

403
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:43,361
l do another little shake...

404
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:45,071
...and...

405
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:50,160
...right back in
the left hand where it started.

406
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:53,747
That isn't magic.

407
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:57,417
What are you talking about?
Of course it's magic.

408
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:00,462
You just kept the penny
in that hand the whole time.

409
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:07,093
Think so?

410
00:39:08,095 --> 00:39:10,722
l didn't know you were funny.

411
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:28,531
[woman] Malcolm, sit your
cute butt down and listen up.

412
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:33,536
No doubt about it.
Anna is like my sister.

413
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:37,332
And you better make her happy.
And l'm not talking about no...

414
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:40,210
..."Mmm! This taste like
real butter" kind of happy.

415
00:39:40,294 --> 00:39:42,921
l'm talking about...
What's up, girl?

416
00:39:42,963 --> 00:39:45,465
"Julie Andrews,
mm-hmm, twirling around

417
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:48,426
like a mental patient on
a mountaintop" kind of happy.

418
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:51,805
Now, that's the kind
of happy l'm talking about.

419
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:53,723
Shh. Come here.

420
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:56,059
Shh. Don't tell her l told you,

421
00:39:56,143 --> 00:39:59,521
but she said she knew she love you

422
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:02,732
from the first time
she met you on the street.

423
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:06,528
She'd do anything for you.

424
00:40:06,612 --> 00:40:10,323
[sobbing] l love you guys.

425
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:12,534
[sniffling]

426
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:15,286
My nose is running. Turn it...

427
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:34,848
[water running]

428
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:44,107
[exhales]

429
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:29,736
[rock music]

430
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:37,368
And then you do the magic shake.

431
00:41:37,411 --> 00:41:40,079
The penny has moved
from my pocket...

432
00:41:40,122 --> 00:41:42,707
...all the way back
to the hand it started in.

433
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:47,170
That's stupid.

434
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:51,549
lt's supposed to be funny.

435
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:53,551
lt's stupid.

436
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:55,595
l want my penny back.

437
00:41:57,223 --> 00:41:59,766
[Mrs. Sear] He doesn't
get invited places, so...

438
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:01,434
[woman] lt's our pleasure.

439
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:04,771
Last time was a Chuck E. Cheese
party a year ago.

440
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:06,648
He hid in one of those purple,

441
00:42:06,732 --> 00:42:08,775
plastic tunnels and didn't come out.

442
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:12,362
- Chucky who?
- Cheese. lt's a kids place.

443
00:42:12,446 --> 00:42:15,281
- [woman] Excuse me.
- [Mrs. Sear] Sorry.

444
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:46,646
[man] Sir.

445
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:49,691
Madam?

446
00:42:49,775 --> 00:42:51,901
ls someone out there?

447
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:55,321
Open this door, please. Come on.

448
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:57,490
l can't breathe.

449
00:42:57,533 --> 00:43:00,493
lf you can hear me, open this door.

450
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:03,746
l swear on my life l didn't
take the master's horse.

451
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:08,501
Open this door, or l'll break
through it and grab you!

452
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:11,462
The star of the commercial
always gets his own trailer.

453
00:43:11,505 --> 00:43:12,964
For what?

454
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:16,092
He needs a place to think
about his character, alone.

455
00:43:16,176 --> 00:43:18,344
You only had one line.

456
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:23,391
[Tommy] Darren, check it out.

457
00:43:23,475 --> 00:43:25,435
Oh, yeah.

458
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:28,021
My dad made me invite him.

459
00:43:45,914 --> 00:43:47,957
Happy birthday, Darren.

460
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:51,294
ls there something
you wanna see in there?

461
00:43:51,378 --> 00:43:53,046
No.

462
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:57,884
We're gonna put on a pretend play.

463
00:43:57,968 --> 00:44:00,386
Wanna be in it?

464
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:02,138
OK.

465
00:44:02,222 --> 00:44:05,433
lt's called Locked in the Dungeon.

466
00:44:05,517 --> 00:44:09,187
Yeah, Cole, and... you get to be
the one locked in the dungeon.

467
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:15,485
Don't! Don't! Don't! Don't!

468
00:44:15,569 --> 00:44:18,738
No! Don't!

469
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:23,076
- [pounding]
- Let me out! No! No! No! No! No! No!

470
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:26,829
- [pounding stops]
- [shuffling]

471
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:29,082
[screams]

472
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:32,001
[hard rock music]

473
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:34,754
[distant screaming]

474
00:44:36,715 --> 00:44:39,717
[pounding, screaming]

475
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:47,058
[Cole] Help! Help! Help!

476
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:48,685
- Cole?
- Oh, no!

477
00:44:48,769 --> 00:44:51,270
- Help! Help!
- [pounding continues]

478
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:54,065

479
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:56,943
- Oh, God. ls there a key for this door?
- Help me!

480
00:44:56,985 --> 00:44:59,112
Cole? Honey, honey, can you hear me?

481
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:01,948
- Open the door!
- God!

482
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:04,951
- No!
- [Mrs. Sear screams]

483
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:07,954
- Oh, my God, Cole!
- Oh, my God! Help me!

484
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:10,123
- [pounding]
- Help! Help!

485
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:12,500
[latches clicking]

486
00:45:12,584 --> 00:45:14,585
[silence]

487
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:18,965
[heavy breathing]

488
00:45:22,469 --> 00:45:25,596
[man] The tests would indicate
he did not have a seizure.

489
00:45:25,639 --> 00:45:27,890
He's doing fine.

490
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:30,476
After some rest,
he can go home tonight.

491
00:45:34,481 --> 00:45:36,149
[chuckles]

492
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:40,361
There's some cuts
and bruises on your son

493
00:45:40,446 --> 00:45:43,489
- that are concerning me.
- Oh, man.

494
00:45:45,325 --> 00:45:47,535
Yeah, those are from sports.

495
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:55,460
You think l hurt my child?

496
00:45:59,047 --> 00:46:01,215
You think l'm a bad mother?

497
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:03,718
Mrs. Sloan over there,

498
00:46:03,802 --> 00:46:06,471
she's a social worker with the hospital,

499
00:46:06,513 --> 00:46:09,932
and she's gonna ask you
a couple procedural questions.

500
00:46:10,017 --> 00:46:13,603
What happened to my child today?

501
00:46:13,687 --> 00:46:16,689
Something was happening to him,
physically happening.

502
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:18,941
Something was very wrong!

503
00:46:23,071 --> 00:46:25,072
Hey.

504
00:46:36,251 --> 00:46:39,086
Did your father used to
tell you bedtime stories?

505
00:46:49,389 --> 00:46:52,767
Once upon a time,
there was this young prince,

506
00:46:52,851 --> 00:46:57,230
and he decided that
he wanted to go for a drive.

507
00:46:57,314 --> 00:47:00,650
And he got his driver,

508
00:47:00,734 --> 00:47:02,693
and they started driving.

509
00:47:02,736 --> 00:47:04,737
Driving, driving.

510
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:10,660
Driving a lot, and, uh... um...

511
00:47:10,744 --> 00:47:13,663
...they drove so much
that he fell asleep.

512
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:16,499
And...

513
00:47:19,586 --> 00:47:23,548
Then he woke up, and he realized
they were still driving.

514
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:26,342
- This was a very long trip.
- Dr. Crowe?

515
00:47:27,636 --> 00:47:30,805
You haven't told
bedtime stories before.

516
00:47:30,889 --> 00:47:33,099
Uh, not too many, no.

517
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:35,685
Well, you have to add
some twists and stuff.

518
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:39,438
OK. Some twists.

519
00:47:41,233 --> 00:47:44,402
Like what kind of twists?
Give me an example.

520
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:47,780
Maybe they run out of gas.

521
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:49,866
They run out of gas?

522
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:53,035
That's good
'cause they're driving, right? OK...

523
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:55,496
Tell me the story
about why you're sad.

524
00:47:58,166 --> 00:48:00,334
You think l'm sad?

525
00:48:03,088 --> 00:48:05,256
What makes you think that?

526
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:09,302
Your eyes told me.

527
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:13,890
l'm not supposed to talk
about stuff like that.

528
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:21,898
[exhales]

529
00:48:24,985 --> 00:48:28,404
Once upon a time, there was
this person named Malcolm.

530
00:48:28,488 --> 00:48:32,158
He worked with children.

531
00:48:32,242 --> 00:48:34,827
He loved it.

532
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:37,580
He loved it more than anything else.

533
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:43,669
And then one night,
he found out that he made a...

534
00:48:43,712 --> 00:48:45,880
...mistake with one of them.

535
00:48:45,964 --> 00:48:48,299
He couldn't help that one.

536
00:48:49,843 --> 00:48:54,513
And he can't stop thinking
about it. He... can't forget.

537
00:48:57,976 --> 00:49:00,645
Ever since then,
things have been different.

538
00:49:02,064 --> 00:49:05,107
He's not the same person
that he used to be.

539
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:11,864
And his wife... doesn't like
the person that he's become.

540
00:49:11,907 --> 00:49:15,910
They barely speak anymore.
They're like strangers.

541
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:22,667
And then one day, Malcolm
meets this wonderful little boy.

542
00:49:22,709 --> 00:49:25,544
A really cool little boy.

543
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:29,382
Reminds him a lot of the other one.

544
00:49:31,718 --> 00:49:34,971
And Malcolm decides
to try and help this new boy...

545
00:49:37,057 --> 00:49:41,769
...'cause he feels that
if he can help this new boy,

546
00:49:41,853 --> 00:49:46,190
be like... helping that other one too.

547
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:51,904
How does the story end?

548
00:49:53,448 --> 00:49:55,449
l don't know.

549
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:16,012
l want to tell you my secret now.

550
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:21,767
OK.

551
00:50:29,484 --> 00:50:32,319
l see dead people.

552
00:50:34,906 --> 00:50:36,907
ln your dreams?

553
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:41,120
While you're awake?

554
00:50:46,835 --> 00:50:50,504
Dead people, like,
in graves and coffins?

555
00:50:50,589 --> 00:50:53,799
Walking around like regular people.

556
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:56,886
They don't see each other.

557
00:50:56,970 --> 00:51:00,306
They only see what they want to see.

558
00:51:01,266 --> 00:51:03,601
They don't know they're dead.

559
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:08,397
How often do you see them?

560
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:14,320
All the time.

561
00:51:16,364 --> 00:51:18,866
They're everywhere.

562
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:24,455
You won't tell anyone my secret, right?

563
00:51:24,498 --> 00:51:27,249
No. l promise.

564
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:32,213
Will you stay here until l fall asleep?

565
00:51:34,007 --> 00:51:35,841
Of course.

566
00:51:44,476 --> 00:51:46,519
[click]

567
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:51,398
[Malcolm] Cole... has pathologies
more severe than initially assessed.

568
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:56,153
He's suffering
from visual hallucinations,

569
00:51:56,196 --> 00:51:58,906
- paranoia...
- [tires screeching]

570
00:51:58,990 --> 00:52:03,327
...some kind of...
school-age schizophrenia.

571
00:52:05,163 --> 00:52:08,833
Medication, hospitalization
may be required.

572
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:16,966
[sighs] And l'm not helping him.

573
00:53:25,785 --> 00:53:27,661
[sighs]

574
00:53:39,132 --> 00:53:41,133
[clears throat]

575
00:53:44,638 --> 00:53:47,139
Hi. This is Lynn Sear, Cole's mom.

576
00:53:48,767 --> 00:53:52,978
Yeah. Uh, yeah, l-l'd like
to talk to you about your boy

577
00:53:53,021 --> 00:53:56,357
and his friends keeping
their goddamn hands off my son.

578
00:55:18,898 --> 00:55:21,233
[shuffling]

579
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:35,831
Mama?

580
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:38,167
No.

581
00:55:38,251 --> 00:55:40,336
Dinner is not ready!

582
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:42,087
What are you gonna do?

583
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:44,506
Y-You can't hurt me anymore!

584
00:55:46,718 --> 00:55:49,720
Lenny, you're
a terrible husband, Lenny!

585
00:55:49,763 --> 00:55:53,057
Look what you made me do! Lenny!

586
00:55:53,099 --> 00:55:55,434
[Cole sobbing]

587
00:56:03,485 --> 00:56:06,945
[panting] l'm OK. OK. OK.

588
00:56:12,327 --> 00:56:14,578
[Tommy] Once there was a boy,

589
00:56:14,621 --> 00:56:17,414
very different from all the other boys.

590
00:56:17,457 --> 00:56:20,125
He lived in the jungle...

591
00:56:21,294 --> 00:56:24,088
...and he could speak
to the animals.

592
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:27,466
- [piano music]
- [camcorders whirring]

593
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:31,637
[kids making animal noises]

594
00:56:31,679 --> 00:56:33,847
[applause]

595
00:56:38,937 --> 00:56:41,688
[Cole] Did you think
the play sucked big time?

596
00:56:41,773 --> 00:56:44,650
Heh. What?

597
00:56:44,734 --> 00:56:47,736
Tommy Tammisimo acted
in a cough syrup commercial.

598
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:51,073
He said everyone was
self-conscious and unrealistic.

599
00:56:51,157 --> 00:56:53,409
He said the play sucked big time.

600
00:56:53,493 --> 00:56:56,245
This Tommy kid sounds like a real punk.

601
00:56:57,914 --> 00:57:01,917
l thought the play was
excellent. Better than Cats.

602
00:57:02,001 --> 00:57:04,503
- Cats?
- Never mind.

603
00:57:06,339 --> 00:57:08,257
Cole, l was really interested

604
00:57:08,341 --> 00:57:10,467
in what you told me at the hospital.

605
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:13,011
l'd like to hear more about it.

606
00:57:23,106 --> 00:57:24,940
Cole?

607
00:57:27,861 --> 00:57:29,528
What?

608
00:57:42,709 --> 00:57:44,710
Something up there?

609
00:57:49,507 --> 00:57:51,341
Cole?

610
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:56,889
l don't see anything.

611
00:58:01,269 --> 00:58:03,270
Be real still.

612
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:10,235
Sometimes you feel it inside,

613
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:13,030
like you're falling down real fast,

614
00:58:13,072 --> 00:58:15,741
but you're really just standing still.

615
00:58:20,663 --> 00:58:25,083
Do you ever feel the prickly
things on the back of your neck?

616
00:58:25,126 --> 00:58:27,794
Yes.

617
00:58:27,879 --> 00:58:31,965
And the tiny hairs on your arm,
you know, when they stand up?

618
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:33,884
Yes.

619
00:58:36,221 --> 00:58:38,222
That's them.

620
00:58:41,518 --> 00:58:43,685
When they get mad...

621
00:58:47,774 --> 00:58:49,775
...it gets cold.

622
00:59:06,918 --> 00:59:10,921
l don't see anything.
Are you sure they're there?

623
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:14,424
Cole?

624
00:59:16,553 --> 00:59:19,429
Please make them leave.

625
00:59:19,472 --> 00:59:21,473
l'm workin' on it.

626
00:59:23,851 --> 00:59:25,686
Come on.

627
00:59:53,214 --> 00:59:56,216
Aah! [laughing]

628
01:00:11,024 --> 01:00:13,358
Mommy, Daddy?

629
01:00:14,485 --> 01:00:16,361
[coughing]

630
01:00:16,404 --> 01:00:18,739
My throat hurts.

631
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:29,124
Run! Run!

632
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:33,003
[announcer]
Pedia Ease cough suppressant.

633
01:00:33,046 --> 01:00:35,422
Gentle, fast, eff...

634
01:00:35,506 --> 01:00:37,758
Cole.

635
01:00:37,842 --> 01:00:41,553
Oh, l don't care what they say.
This thing is broken.

636
01:00:49,395 --> 01:00:51,396
Take 'em off.

637
01:00:55,318 --> 01:00:57,486
l don't want them on my table.

638
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:05,369
l saw what was in your bureau
drawer when l was cleaning.

639
01:01:05,411 --> 01:01:07,621
Got something you want to confess?

640
01:01:10,583 --> 01:01:12,167
Hmm?

641
01:01:12,251 --> 01:01:15,921
The bumblebee pendant?
Why do you keep taking it?

642
01:01:20,551 --> 01:01:22,719
lt was Grandma's.

643
01:01:22,762 --> 01:01:26,098
You know, what if it broke?
You know how sad l'd be.

644
01:01:28,267 --> 01:01:31,269
You'd cry 'cause you
miss Grandma so much.

645
01:01:32,271 --> 01:01:34,272
That's right.

646
01:01:38,528 --> 01:01:42,197
Sometimes people think
they lose things...

647
01:01:43,991 --> 01:01:47,828
...and they really didn't
lose them, it just gets moved.

648
01:01:47,912 --> 01:01:50,414
So did you move
the bumblebee pendant?

649
01:01:58,297 --> 01:02:00,215
Don't get mad.

650
01:02:00,299 --> 01:02:02,342
So who moved it this time?

651
01:02:02,427 --> 01:02:05,762
Maybe someone came in our house,
took the bumblebee pendant

652
01:02:05,805 --> 01:02:08,890
out of my closet and placed
it nicely in your drawer.

653
01:02:10,143 --> 01:02:13,562
- Maybe.
- God, l am so tired, Cole.

654
01:02:13,646 --> 01:02:16,148
l'm tired in my body,
l'm tired in my mind,

655
01:02:16,190 --> 01:02:18,984
l'm... tired in my heart.

656
01:02:19,068 --> 01:02:22,320
l need some help. You know,
l don't know if you noticed,

657
01:02:22,405 --> 01:02:25,699
but our little family
isn't doing so good.

658
01:02:25,783 --> 01:02:30,162
l mean, l've been praying,
but l must not be praying right.

659
01:02:30,204 --> 01:02:34,666
Looks like we're just gonna have
to answer each other's prayers.

660
01:02:37,545 --> 01:02:40,714
lf we can't talk to each other,
we're not gonna make it.

661
01:02:44,051 --> 01:02:47,721
Now, tell me, baby.
l-l... l won't get mad, honey.

662
01:02:47,805 --> 01:02:50,640
Did you take the bumblebee pendant?

663
01:02:58,858 --> 01:03:01,359
- No.
- [silverware clatters]

664
01:03:03,070 --> 01:03:06,406
You've had enough roast beef.
You need to leave the table.

665
01:03:08,451 --> 01:03:10,118
Go!

666
01:03:20,671 --> 01:03:23,173
[barking, whimpering]

667
01:03:27,386 --> 01:03:29,221
[gasps]

668
01:03:33,309 --> 01:03:35,227
Hey, come on.

669
01:03:35,311 --> 01:03:38,146
l'll show you where
my dad keeps his gun. Come on.

670
01:03:40,817 --> 01:03:42,651
[dog whimpering]

671
01:03:43,945 --> 01:03:47,364
[sobbing] Sebastian, come on.

672
01:03:47,406 --> 01:03:49,241
Mama?

673
01:03:55,915 --> 01:03:58,583
lf you're not very mad,

674
01:03:58,668 --> 01:04:01,336
can l sleep in your bed tonight?

675
01:04:03,172 --> 01:04:05,674
Look at my face.

676
01:04:05,758 --> 01:04:07,926
l'm not very mad.

677
01:04:13,057 --> 01:04:15,559
Baby, why are you shaking?

678
01:04:16,644 --> 01:04:18,812
Cole, what's wrong?

679
01:04:18,896 --> 01:04:22,691
Oh, God, please tell me!

680
01:04:22,775 --> 01:04:24,776
Oh, please.

681
01:04:28,322 --> 01:04:30,156
Oh.

682
01:04:38,958 --> 01:04:40,959
[Anna] lt's Edwardian,

683
01:04:41,002 --> 01:04:43,795
beautifully worked
with mine-cut diamonds

684
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:47,132
and an actual color Burmese sapphire.

685
01:04:47,216 --> 01:04:49,843
lt's timeless.

686
01:04:49,927 --> 01:04:51,761
Oh.

687
01:04:52,722 --> 01:04:54,973
You, uh... [clears throat]

688
01:04:55,057 --> 01:04:57,225
...got anything a little plainer?

689
01:04:57,310 --> 01:04:59,144
Plainer?

690
01:04:59,186 --> 01:05:02,814
You want a plain ring to go with
your plain fianc‚? ls that how it is?

691
01:05:02,899 --> 01:05:06,067
No! Baby, don't... don't get in a tizzy.

692
01:05:08,905 --> 01:05:10,655
Uh...

693
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:13,450
You're so beautiful.

694
01:05:13,492 --> 01:05:17,162
Y-You're like a Burmese
sapphire all by yourself.

695
01:05:17,246 --> 01:05:20,206
- You don't need all that.
- Uh-huh.

696
01:05:20,291 --> 01:05:24,961
Why don't you try it on and see
how you both feel about it?

697
01:05:30,343 --> 01:05:32,677
There. How does that feel?

698
01:05:34,013 --> 01:05:37,641
l think this piece, um,
communicates a longing.

699
01:05:37,683 --> 01:05:41,311
l imagine that the woman who owned it

700
01:05:41,354 --> 01:05:44,189
loved a man that she couldn't be with.

701
01:05:45,942 --> 01:05:49,152
Did he have wavy hair and chestnut eyes?

702
01:05:49,195 --> 01:05:53,323
- What?
- Um, l-l don't know, but...

703
01:05:53,366 --> 01:05:56,326
...a lot of the pieces
in this store communicate,

704
01:05:56,369 --> 01:05:59,704
and l think you should choose
a piece that speaks to you.

705
01:06:01,332 --> 01:06:05,418
l think maybe when people own
things and then they pass away,

706
01:06:05,503 --> 01:06:09,631
a part of themselves gets
printed on those things,

707
01:06:09,715 --> 01:06:13,218
like... like fingerprints.

708
01:06:14,762 --> 01:06:16,930
l'll just wrap it up.

709
01:06:24,355 --> 01:06:26,606
You don't need a guy with a master's.

710
01:06:26,691 --> 01:06:29,776
You need a wrestler with
a neck larger than his head.

711
01:06:29,860 --> 01:06:32,779
[chuckles] No, l need
a wrestler with a master's.

712
01:06:34,115 --> 01:06:36,574
- What's this?
- Happy birthday.

713
01:06:36,617 --> 01:06:38,618

717
01:06:52,675 --> 01:06:54,843
Oh, this is too much.

718
01:06:54,927 --> 01:06:58,430
No. Took it out
of your Christmas bonus.

719
01:06:59,849 --> 01:07:02,600
lt's perfect, Anna.

720
01:07:02,685 --> 01:07:04,769
Thanks.

721
01:07:04,854 --> 01:07:06,855
[chuckles]

722
01:07:10,609 --> 01:07:13,570
[Cole] What do you want
more than anything?

723
01:07:13,612 --> 01:07:15,613
[Malcolm] l don't know.

724
01:07:15,698 --> 01:07:17,824
[Cole] l told you what l want.

725
01:07:17,908 --> 01:07:20,243
- [bang, glass breaking]

726

[Malcolm] l know what l want.

727
01:07:25,499 --> 01:07:28,334
l want to be able
to talk to my wife again...

728
01:07:30,129 --> 01:07:32,630
...the way we used
to talk to each other...

729
01:07:34,175 --> 01:07:36,926
...like there was no one
else in the world except us.

730
01:07:38,804 --> 01:07:40,972
[Cole] How are you gonna do that?

731
01:07:44,143 --> 01:07:46,102
[sighs]

732
01:07:46,145 --> 01:07:48,480
l can't be
your doctor anymore.

733
01:07:48,522 --> 01:07:52,567
l haven't paid enough
attention to my family.

734
01:07:52,651 --> 01:07:55,320
Bad things happen
when you do that.

735
01:07:56,822 --> 01:07:59,449
Do you understand?

736
01:07:59,492 --> 01:08:02,077
l'm going to transfer you.
l know two psychol...

737

Don't fail me.

738
01:08:05,998 --> 01:08:09,918
Don't give up. You're the only
one who can help me. l know it.

739
01:08:10,002 --> 01:08:12,170
l can't help you.

740
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:17,175
You...

741
01:08:17,259 --> 01:08:19,594
Someone else can help you.

742
01:08:22,515 --> 01:08:24,849
You believe me, right?

743
01:08:29,355 --> 01:08:32,190
Dr. Crowe, you believe my secret, right?

744
01:08:34,068 --> 01:08:37,112
l don't know how
to answer that, Cole.

745
01:08:47,123 --> 01:08:50,041
How can you help me...

746
01:08:50,084 --> 01:08:52,752
...if you don't believe me?

747
01:08:56,715 --> 01:08:59,717
Some magic's real.

748
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:19,195
[Vincent] Do you know why
you're afraid when you're alone?

749
01:09:21,198 --> 01:09:24,159
l do. l do.

750
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:29,789
[click, tape hissing]

751
01:09:29,874 --> 01:09:32,250
[Malcolm] l'm sorry about that, Vincent.

752
01:09:32,334 --> 01:09:35,044
l hope l didn't leave
you alone too long.

753
01:09:35,087 --> 01:09:38,756
- Whew. lt's cold in here.
- [Vincent sobbing]

754
01:09:41,093 --> 01:09:44,262
Vincent, why are you crying?

755
01:09:48,767 --> 01:09:52,604
[Vincent sniffles]
You won't believe.

- [click]
- [Malcolm] No, you know what?

763
01:10:22,635 --> 01:10:23,927
l never liked 'em either.

764
01:10:23,969 --> 01:10:26,471
When l was a kid,
l had this blood test done,

765
01:10:26,513 --> 01:10:30,183
and l threw up chili cheese
fries all over this male nurse.

766
01:10:30,267 --> 01:10:32,477
- [Vincent giggles]
- [knocking, door opens]

767
01:10:32,561 --> 01:10:34,979

768
01:10:35,064 --> 01:10:37,815
Vincent, will you excuse me?
l have to take this.

769
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:40,401
- Just give me a minute, OK?
- OK.

770
01:10:43,030 --> 01:10:44,864
[door shuts]

771
01:10:51,121 --> 01:10:52,956

[Vincent panting]

773
01:11:23,028 --> 01:11:26,322
[faint voice, indistinct]

774
01:11:38,961 --> 01:11:41,045
[tape hissing loudly]

775
01:11:41,088 --> 01:11:42,922
[Vincent breathing heavily]

776
01:11:43,007 --> 01:11:45,675
[faint voice continues]

777
01:11:50,597 --> 01:11:53,808
[man speaking Spanish]

778
01:11:53,892 --> 01:11:57,687
No entiendes.

779
01:11:57,730 --> 01:12:00,565
Yo no quiero morir.

780
01:12:00,607 --> 01:12:03,776
Yo no quiero morir...
[continues in Spanish]

781
01:12:07,781 --> 01:12:09,407
Yo no quiero morir.

782
01:12:09,450 --> 01:12:12,744
- Oh, my God.
- Yo no quiero morir!

783
01:12:18,751 --> 01:12:21,085
You been running around?

784
01:12:24,506 --> 01:12:27,008
Make you feel better?

785
01:12:28,260 --> 01:12:31,012
l like to run around.
lt's good exercise.

786
01:12:34,516 --> 01:12:36,893
Do you wanna ask me questions now?

787
01:12:38,979 --> 01:12:42,648
Wanna be a lance corporal in Company M,
Third Battalion, Seventh Marines?

788
01:12:42,733 --> 01:12:45,610
We're being dispatched
into the Quang Nam province.

789
01:12:45,652 --> 01:12:47,487
Maybe later.

790
01:12:50,282 --> 01:12:52,575
Something happened, didn't it?

791
01:12:54,661 --> 01:12:57,038
You wiggin' out?

792
01:12:59,291 --> 01:13:01,042
Yes.

793
01:13:01,126 --> 01:13:02,960
l think l am.

794
01:13:05,339 --> 01:13:08,966
[Malcolm] Do you know what
"yo no quiero morir" means?

795
01:13:09,009 --> 01:13:12,428
lt's Spanish. lt means
"l don't want to die."

796
01:13:14,765 --> 01:13:17,934
What do you think these ghosts
want when they talk to you?

797
01:13:25,526 --> 01:13:27,693
l want you to think about it, Cole.

798
01:13:29,279 --> 01:13:32,615
l want you to think
about it really carefully.

799
01:13:32,658 --> 01:13:34,826
What do you think they want?

800
01:13:38,831 --> 01:13:40,665
Just help.

801
01:13:40,707 --> 01:13:43,543
That's right. That's what l think too.

802
01:13:43,627 --> 01:13:46,379
They just want help,
even the scary ones.

803
01:13:46,463 --> 01:13:49,507
And l think l might know
a way to make them go away.

804
01:13:49,550 --> 01:13:51,342
How?

805
01:13:52,302 --> 01:13:54,303
Listen to them.

806
01:13:56,265 --> 01:13:58,433
What if they don't want help?

807
01:13:58,517 --> 01:14:02,019
What if they're just angry and
they just want to hurt somebody?

808
01:14:02,062 --> 01:14:04,397
l don't think that's the way it works.

809
01:14:04,481 --> 01:14:06,482
How do you know for sure?

810
01:14:08,610 --> 01:14:10,445
l don't.

811
01:14:31,258 --> 01:14:32,925
Hey.

What's... what's happening?

816
01:15:03,165 --> 01:15:04,999
Cole!

817
01:15:08,587 --> 01:15:10,421

[gasps]

837
01:18:35,752 --> 01:18:38,754
She came a long way
to visit me, didn't she?

838
01:18:40,132 --> 01:18:42,133
l guess she did.

839
01:19:02,738 --> 01:19:21,338
[woman sobbing]

840
01:19:28,764 --> 01:19:30,765
Can you get some water?

01:19:34,728 --> 01:19:36,729
That's her sister.

l just can't imagine a child
being in bed for two years.

845
01:20:02,380 --> 01:20:04,924
[woman 2] How many...

846
01:20:05,008 --> 01:20:07,885

- Six different doctors?

847
01:20:07,928 --> 01:20:10,638

Don't go home, OK?

851
01:20:45,257 --> 01:20:47,258
l definitely won't.

852
01:21:42,981 --> 01:21:44,106

[Kyra] Oh, no! Here he comes!
Look, he's coming my way. Psst.

We'llsee.

886
01:27:18,149 --> 01:27:21,693
Who, uh... who were you talking to?

887
01:27:28,243 --> 01:27:30,410
Just practicing my lines.

888
01:27:34,123 --> 01:27:37,042
[Cole] Thanks for giving me
this part, Mr. Cunningham.

889
01:27:37,126 --> 01:27:41,046
When l went to school here, there
was a terrible fire in the theater.

890
01:27:41,130 --> 01:27:43,131
They rebuilt the whole thing.

891
01:27:43,174 --> 01:27:45,008
Yeah, l know.

892
01:27:46,511 --> 01:27:49,012
[audience] Aw.

893
01:27:56,187 --> 01:27:58,480
Only he who is pure of heart

894
01:27:58,523 --> 01:28:01,316
can take the sword from the stone.

895
01:28:01,359 --> 01:28:03,360
Let the boy try.

896
01:28:05,863 --> 01:28:08,031
[scattered applause]

897
01:28:10,952 --> 01:28:14,037
But he is a stable boy.
He cleans up after the horses.

898
01:28:14,122 --> 01:28:16,123
Silence, village idiot.

899
01:28:17,375 --> 01:28:20,043
Let the boy step forward.

900
01:28:44,152 --> 01:28:46,153
[all gasp]

901
01:28:47,155 --> 01:28:50,073
[all] Hail King Arthur!

902
01:28:50,158 --> 01:28:52,159
[applause]

903
01:28:55,538 --> 01:28:57,789
[kids] Yea!

904
01:28:57,874 --> 01:29:00,125
- Hoorah!
- [applause]

905
01:29:00,209 --> 01:29:02,377
[kids shouting]

906
01:29:06,174 --> 01:29:08,342
[audience laughing]

907
01:29:09,469 --> 01:29:11,970
[applause resumes]

908
01:29:17,685 --> 01:29:19,853
[kids chattering]

909
01:29:22,523 --> 01:29:25,192
l thought you were really
great in the play, Cole.

910
01:29:25,276 --> 01:29:27,694
- Really?
- Yeah.

911
01:29:27,779 --> 01:29:30,322
- You know what else?
- What?

912
01:29:30,406 --> 01:29:33,325
l thought Tommy Tammisimo
sucked big-time.

913
01:29:34,786 --> 01:29:36,453
Ha-ha-ha.

914
01:29:36,496 --> 01:29:38,497
[chuckles]

915
01:29:41,709 --> 01:29:45,295
l got an idea how you
can talk to your wife.

916
01:29:45,338 --> 01:29:48,423
Wait till she's asleep.

917
01:29:48,466 --> 01:29:52,177
Then she'll listen to you
and she won't even know it.

918
01:29:59,310 --> 01:30:01,645
l'm not gonna see you anymore, am l?

919
01:30:04,482 --> 01:30:07,734
l think we said
everything we needed to say.

920
01:30:07,819 --> 01:30:11,822
Maybe it's time to say things
to someone closer to you.

921
01:30:13,699 --> 01:30:17,494
Maybe we can pretend like we're
gonna see each other tomorrow.

922
01:30:19,372 --> 01:30:21,373
Just for pretend.

923
01:30:27,797 --> 01:30:29,631
OK.

924
01:30:34,345 --> 01:30:36,346
l'm gonna go now.

925
01:30:43,104 --> 01:30:45,814
l'll see you tomorrow, Cole.

926
01:31:06,043 --> 01:31:08,211
[siren wailing]

927
01:31:09,797 --> 01:31:12,632
[chatter on police radio]

928
01:31:12,717 --> 01:31:16,011
l-l'm OK, officer. l-l'm OK.

929
01:31:16,053 --> 01:31:18,221
l don't know what happened.

930
01:31:24,061 --> 01:31:25,896
[Lynn] Hmm.

931
01:31:26,898 --> 01:31:29,733
Jeez, l hope nobody got hurt.

932
01:31:33,362 --> 01:31:36,114
You're very quiet.

933
01:31:36,199 --> 01:31:39,534
You're mad l missed
the play, aren't you?

934
01:31:39,577 --> 01:31:42,245
l have two jobs, baby.

935
01:31:42,330 --> 01:31:45,457
You know how important
they are for us.

936
01:31:45,541 --> 01:31:47,292
[sighs]

937
01:31:47,376 --> 01:31:50,045
l'd give anything to have been there.

938
01:32:01,933 --> 01:32:04,601
l'm ready to communicate with you now.

939
01:32:09,357 --> 01:32:11,191
Communicate?

940
01:32:12,985 --> 01:32:15,320
Tell you my secrets.

941
01:32:17,073 --> 01:32:19,074
What is it?

942
01:32:23,287 --> 01:32:25,956
You know the accident up there?

943
01:32:26,040 --> 01:32:27,874
Yeah?

944
01:32:29,168 --> 01:32:31,294
Someone got hurt.

945
01:32:31,337 --> 01:32:33,463
They did?

946
01:32:33,548 --> 01:32:35,382
A lady.

947
01:32:37,176 --> 01:32:39,469
She died.

948
01:32:39,554 --> 01:32:42,055
Oh, my God. What, you can see her?

949
01:32:43,266 --> 01:32:45,100
Yes.

950
01:32:45,142 --> 01:32:47,143
Where is she?

951
01:32:50,022 --> 01:32:52,524
Standing next to my window.

952
01:32:59,824 --> 01:33:01,825
Cole, you're scaring me.

953
01:33:03,202 --> 01:33:05,662
They scare me too sometimes.

954
01:33:07,707 --> 01:33:09,541
They?

955
01:33:13,462 --> 01:33:15,338
Ghosts.

956
01:33:18,884 --> 01:33:21,219
You see ghosts, Cole?

957
01:33:24,181 --> 01:33:27,225
They want me to do things for them.

958
01:33:29,729 --> 01:33:32,188
They... they talk to you?

959
01:33:32,231 --> 01:33:35,358
They tell you to do things?

960
01:33:35,401 --> 01:33:38,570
They're the ones that used to hurt me.

961
01:33:40,698 --> 01:33:43,658
What are you thinking, Mama?

962
01:33:43,701 --> 01:33:45,869
You think l'm a freak?

963
01:33:45,911 --> 01:33:48,163
Look at my face.

964
01:33:48,205 --> 01:33:51,416
l would never think
that about you. Ever.

965
01:33:52,585 --> 01:33:55,086
- Got it?
- Got it.

966
01:34:02,219 --> 01:34:04,554
Just let me think for a minute.

967
01:34:08,309 --> 01:34:10,560
Grandma says hi.

968
01:34:13,856 --> 01:34:17,067
She says she's sorry for
taking the bumblebee pendant.

969
01:34:17,109 --> 01:34:19,277
She just likes it a lot.

970
01:34:21,656 --> 01:34:23,490
What?

971
01:34:23,574 --> 01:34:26,242
Grandma comes to visit me sometimes.

972
01:34:28,412 --> 01:34:30,955
Cole, that's very wrong.

973
01:34:31,040 --> 01:34:34,042
- Grandma's gone, you know that.
- l know.

974
01:34:34,085 --> 01:34:36,586
- She wanted me to tell you...
- Cole, please stop.

975
01:34:36,629 --> 01:34:39,297
She wanted me to tell you
she saw you dance.

976
01:34:41,717 --> 01:34:45,303
She said... when you were little,

977
01:34:45,388 --> 01:34:47,555
you and her had a fight

978
01:34:47,598 --> 01:34:50,433
right before your dance recital.

979
01:34:54,105 --> 01:34:57,607
You thought she didn't
come to see you dance.

980
01:35:01,195 --> 01:35:03,363
She did.

981
01:35:08,744 --> 01:35:11,579
She hid in the back
so you wouldn't see.

982
01:35:12,665 --> 01:35:15,625
She said you were like an angel.

983
01:35:20,214 --> 01:35:22,382
She said...

984
01:35:22,466 --> 01:35:25,635
...you came to the place
where they buried her...

985
01:35:27,972 --> 01:35:30,306
...asked her a question.

986
01:35:32,935 --> 01:35:35,603
She said the answer is...

987
01:35:37,398 --> 01:35:39,524
..."Every day."

988
01:35:41,944 --> 01:35:44,279
What did you ask?

989
01:35:52,496 --> 01:35:54,164
Do...

990
01:35:55,708 --> 01:35:58,543
Do l make her proud?

991
01:36:02,006 --> 01:36:04,549
Mama.

992
01:36:22,735 --> 01:36:25,236
[people laughing on TV]

993
01:36:33,329 --> 01:36:35,246
[man] Hi, everybody.

994
01:36:35,331 --> 01:36:38,917
As most of you know,
l'm not used to doing this,

995
01:36:39,001 --> 01:36:42,879
and, uh, l promised Anna that
l'd try not to embarrass her.

996
01:36:42,963 --> 01:36:44,964
l'll leave that to her mother.

997
01:36:45,049 --> 01:36:46,800
[chuckling]

998
01:36:46,884 --> 01:36:49,260
But we do want to thank
all of you for coming

999
01:36:49,345 --> 01:36:52,096
and for sharing this
wonderful day with us.

1000
01:36:52,181 --> 01:36:54,599
lt's, uh... bittersweet,
almost, for me,

1001
01:36:54,683 --> 01:36:57,310
because l hate giving her up...

1002
01:36:57,394 --> 01:36:59,395
Anna?

1003
01:37:09,532 --> 01:37:11,533
l miss you.

1004
01:37:17,122 --> 01:37:19,999
l miss you too.

1005
01:37:20,084 --> 01:37:22,919
Why, Malcolm?

1006
01:37:23,838 --> 01:37:25,672
What?

1007
01:37:27,424 --> 01:37:31,094
- What is it? What?
- Why did you leave me?

1008
01:37:31,178 --> 01:37:34,013
l didn't leave you.

1009
01:37:37,601 --> 01:37:39,936
[clattering]

1010
01:37:54,952 --> 01:37:57,120
[Cole] lsee people.

1011
01:37:58,956 --> 01:38:01,499
They don't know they're dead.

1012
01:38:04,670 --> 01:38:07,839
[Malcolm] How often do you see them?

1013
01:38:07,923 --> 01:38:10,425
All the time.

1014
01:38:13,053 --> 01:38:14,971
They're everywhere.

1015
01:38:25,316 --> 01:38:28,860
They only see what they want to see.

1016
01:38:33,198 --> 01:38:35,992
[Malcolm] OK, Mikey.

1017
01:38:37,828 --> 01:38:41,164
Come on. Give me a minute.

1018
01:39:11,737 --> 01:39:14,030
- [gunshot]
- [groaning]

1019
01:39:14,073 --> 01:39:16,199
[Anna screams]

1020
01:39:16,241 --> 01:39:18,910
[sobbing]

1021
01:39:18,994 --> 01:39:21,496
- Oh, God. Oh, God, honey.
- [groaning]

1022
01:39:21,538 --> 01:39:23,539
- Did Vincent...
- Let me see.

1023
01:39:23,582 --> 01:39:25,249
lt doesn't even hurt.

1024
01:39:27,795 --> 01:39:30,463
- Let me see. Take your hand...
- [groaning]

1025
01:39:30,547 --> 01:39:32,382
Oh, God.

1026
01:39:38,722 --> 01:39:40,807
OK. OK.

1027
01:39:40,891 --> 01:39:43,059
[Anna sobbing]

1028
01:39:44,269 --> 01:39:47,563
- [gasps]
- [groaning]

1029
01:39:58,742 --> 01:40:03,454
Anna, l think l'm OK.
Really, l think it just went...

1030
01:40:03,539 --> 01:40:06,040
...went in and out. l...

1031
01:40:08,877 --> 01:40:11,379
lt doesn't even hurt anymore.

1032
01:40:21,724 --> 01:40:23,725
[long exhale]

1033
01:40:41,326 --> 01:40:43,661
l think l can go now.

1034
01:40:47,666 --> 01:40:50,334
Just needed to do a couple things.

1035
01:40:55,215 --> 01:40:57,550
l needed to help someone.

1036
01:41:00,304 --> 01:41:02,472
l think l did.

1037
01:41:08,687 --> 01:41:11,522
And l needed to tell you something.

1038
01:41:16,278 --> 01:41:18,446
You were never second.

1039
01:41:19,448 --> 01:41:21,282
Ever.

1040
01:41:24,286 --> 01:41:26,454
l love you.

1041
01:41:32,586 --> 01:41:34,754
You sleep now.

1042
01:41:36,673 --> 01:41:39,383
Everything will be
different in the morning.

1043
01:41:45,432 --> 01:41:47,767
Good night, Malcolm.

1044
01:41:53,190 --> 01:41:55,525
Good night, sweetheart.

1045
01:46:39,976 --> 01:46:42,645
Yo no quiero morir.
