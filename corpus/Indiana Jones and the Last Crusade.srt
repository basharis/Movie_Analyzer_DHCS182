1
00:00:30,002 --> 00:00:31,333
Halt! Halt!

2
00:01:34,166 --> 00:01:35,497
-Stop!
-What?

3
00:01:35,567 --> 00:01:37,296
Stop! Stop!

4
00:01:37,369 --> 00:01:39,166
You're going the wrong way.

5
00:01:39,238 --> 00:01:40,933
We have to get to Berlin.

6
00:01:41,006 --> 00:01:43,031
Brody's this way.

7
00:01:43,108 --> 00:01:44,905
My diary's in Berlin.

8
00:01:44,977 --> 00:01:47,241
We don't
need the diary, Dad.

9
00:01:47,312 --> 00:01:48,870
Marcus has the map.

10
00:01:48,947 --> 00:01:52,110
There is more in the diary
than just the map.

11
00:01:53,285 --> 00:01:55,449
All right, Dad. Tell me.

12
00:01:55,449 --> 00:02:01,183
Well, he who finds the Grail
must face the final challenge.

13
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:02,687
What final challenge?

14
00:02:02,756 --> 00:02:05,919
Three devices
of such lethal cunning.

15
00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:07,152
Booby traps?

16
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:08,524
Oh, yes.

17
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:11,996
But I found the clues that
will safely take us through,

18
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:14,295
in the Chronicles
of St. Anselm.

19
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:16,767
Well, what are they?

20
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,705
Can't you remember?

21
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:24,934
I wrote them down in my diary

22
00:02:25,011 --> 00:02:27,536
so that I wouldn't have
to remember.

23
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:29,343
Half the German army's
on our tail,

24
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:31,111
and you want me to go
to Berlin?

25
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:32,208
Into the lion's den?

26
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:33,274
Yes.

27
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:35,253
The only thing that matters
is the Grail.

28
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:36,687
What about Marcus?

29
00:02:36,756 --> 00:02:38,747
Marcus would agree with me.

30
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:41,293
Two selfless martyrs.

31
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:43,261
Jesus Christ.

32
00:02:46,433 --> 00:02:47,991
That's for blasphemy.

33
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:56,666
The quest for the Grail
is not archaeology.

34
00:02:56,743 --> 00:02:59,303
It's a race against evil.

35
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:03,110
If it is captured by the Nazis,
the armies of darkness

36
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,651
will march all over
the face of the Earth.

37
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:07,118
Do you understand me?

38
00:03:09,089 --> 00:03:10,954
This is an obsession, Dad.

39
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:13,083
I never understood it.

40
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:14,558
Never.

41
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:17,955
Neither did Mom.

42
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:20,022
Oh, yes, she did.

43
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,068
Only too well.

44
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:27,539
Unfortunately, she kept
her illness from me

45
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:30,235
until all I could do
was mourn her.

46
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:36,467
My boy, we are pilgrims
in an unholy land.

47
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:07,930
Fraulein Doctor.

48
00:05:08,008 --> 00:05:09,134
Where is it?

49
00:05:09,209 --> 00:05:10,301
How did you get here?

50
00:05:10,377 --> 00:05:11,537
Where is it?

51
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:13,977
I want it.

52
00:05:15,382 --> 00:05:18,317
You came back for the book? Why?

53
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:20,316
My father didn't want
it incinerated.

54
00:05:20,387 --> 00:05:22,912
Is that
what you think of me?

55
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,786
I believe in the Grail,
not the swastika.

56
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:26,189
But you stood up to be counted

57
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:28,750
with the enemy of everything
that the Grail stands for.

58
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:30,762
Who gives a damn what you think?

59
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,320
You do.

60
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:36,130
All I have to
do is squeeze.

61
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:38,466
All I have to do is scream.

62
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:48,773
I've got it.

63
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,816
Let's get the hell out of here.

64
00:07:02,956 --> 00:07:04,048
What did you get?

65
00:07:04,124 --> 00:07:05,250
I don't know.

66
00:07:05,325 --> 00:07:07,259
First available flight
out of Germany.

67
00:07:07,327 --> 00:07:09,386
Good.

68
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:36,918
Well, we made it.

69
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:40,323
When we're airborne,
with Germany behind us,

70
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:43,260
then I'll share
that sentiment.

71
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:45,422
Relax.

72
00:08:30,109 --> 00:08:32,407
Tickets, please.

73
00:08:43,957 --> 00:08:45,618
Guten Tag...

74
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:47,421
Herr Jones.

75
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:52,259
Tickets, please.

76
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:06,812
Oh, we should
get out of here.

77
00:09:08,348 --> 00:09:10,111
No ticket.

78
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:13,513
Ticket.

79
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:14,985
-Ticket!
-Ticket!

80
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:16,453
-Ticket! -Ticket!

81
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,071
You know,

82
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:39,544
sharing your adventures is
an interesting experience.

83
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:41,876
That's not all we shared.

84
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:43,381
It's disgraceful.

85
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:45,144
You're old enough
to be her fa...

86
00:09:45,218 --> 00:09:46,480
her-her grandfather.

87
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:48,520
Well, I'm as human
as the next man.

88
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,556
I was the next man.

89
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:51,749
Oh.

90
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,551
Of course. Well...

91
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:57,118
Ships that pass
in the night.

92
00:09:57,196 --> 00:10:00,632
Do you remember the last time
we had a quiet drink, hmm?

93
00:10:02,669 --> 00:10:04,000
I had a milkshake.

94
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:06,004
Hmm?

95
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:08,267
What did we
talk about?

96
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:10,332
We didn't talk.

97
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,809
We never talked.

98
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:17,714
Do I detect
a rebuke?

99
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:19,752
A regret.

100
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:21,309
It was just the two of us, Dad.

101
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:22,945
It was a lonely way to grow up.

102
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:24,148
For you, too.

103
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:25,986
If you'd been an ordinary,
average father,

104
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:28,323
like the other guys' dads,
you'd have understood that.

105
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:31,488
Actually, I was
a wonderful father.

106
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:33,532
When?

107
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,464
Did I ever tell
you to eat up?

108
00:10:35,535 --> 00:10:37,127
Go to bed?
Wash your ears?

109
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:38,727
Do your homework? No.

110
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:40,602
I respected
your privacy,

111
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:42,937
and I taught
you self-reliance.

112
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:44,033
What you taught me was

113
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:45,577
that I was
less important to you

114
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,044
than people
who'd been dead

115
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:48,671
for 500 years
in another country.

116
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:50,511
And I learned it so well

117
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:53,381
that we've hardly spoken
for 20 years.

118
00:10:53,453 --> 00:10:55,717
You left just when you
were becoming interesting.

119
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:57,255
Unbelievable.

120
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:58,381
Dad, how can you...?

121
00:10:58,491 --> 00:10:59,515
Very well.

122
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:02,026
I'm here now.

123
00:11:02,095 --> 00:11:04,120
What do you want
to talk about?

124
00:11:04,197 --> 00:11:05,323
Hmm?

125
00:11:05,465 --> 00:11:07,865
Well, I...

126
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:11,531
Uh...

127
00:11:15,308 --> 00:11:17,572
I can't think of anything.

128
00:11:17,643 --> 00:11:19,702
Then what are
you complaining about?

129
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,315
Look, we have work to do.

130
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:26,918
When we get to
Alexandretta,

131
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:29,284
we will face
three challenges.

132
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,289
The first,

133
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:32,881
''The Breath of God.

134
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,223
Only the penitent
man will pass.''

135
00:11:35,294 --> 00:11:36,556
Second,

136
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:37,891
''The Word of God.

137
00:11:37,964 --> 00:11:41,525
Only in the footsteps
of God will he proceed.''

138
00:11:41,601 --> 00:11:42,693
Third,

139
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:44,259
''The Path of God.

140
00:11:44,337 --> 00:11:46,362
''Only in the leap
from the lion's head

141
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:48,999
will he prove his worth.''

142
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:53,135
What does that mean?

143
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:55,146
I don't know.

144
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:56,647
We'll find out.

145
00:12:03,156 --> 00:12:06,182
We're turning around.

146
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:08,693
They're taking us back
to Germany.

147
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:17,031
Well, I thought
it would take them a lot longer

148
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:18,434
to figure out
the radio was dead.

149
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:20,472
Come on, Dad. Move!

150
00:12:24,177 --> 00:12:26,475
Come on, Dad. Come on!

151
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,553
I didn't know you
could fly a plane.

152
00:12:42,628 --> 00:12:43,788
Fly, yes.

153
00:12:46,032 --> 00:12:48,330
Land, no.

154
00:13:11,858 --> 00:13:14,019
Dad, you're going to have
to use the machine gun.

155
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:16,288
Get it ready.

156
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:18,762
Eleven o'clock!

157
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:21,095
Dad, eleven o'clock!

158
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:24,636
What happens at eleven o'clock?

159
00:13:24,704 --> 00:13:26,672
Twelve, eleven, ten.

160
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:28,707
Eleven o'clock, fire!

161
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:57,260
Dad, are we hit?!

162
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:59,361
More or less.

163
00:13:59,438 --> 00:14:01,303
Son, I'm sorry.

164
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,533
They got us.

165
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:06,500
Hang on, Dad.

166
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:07,841
We're going in!

167
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:21,652
Nice landing.

168
00:14:21,727 --> 00:14:23,752
Thanks.

169
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:39,667
Those people are
trying to kill us!

170
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:40,837
I know, Dad!

171
00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:42,278
Well.

172
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:44,339
It's a new
experience for me.

173
00:14:44,417 --> 00:14:46,977
It happens to me all the time.

174
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:19,418
This is intolerable!

175
00:15:20,786 --> 00:15:22,151
This could be close.

176
00:15:30,463 --> 00:15:33,023
Faster, boy! Faster!

177
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:51,047
Well, they don't come
any closer than that!

178
00:16:06,866 --> 00:16:09,699
Dad, he's coming back!

179
00:16:56,248 --> 00:16:58,808
I suddenly
remembered my Charlemagne.

180
00:16:58,884 --> 00:17:01,785
''Let my armies be the rocks
and the trees

181
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:04,015
and the birds in the sky.''

182
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,734
These pages are taken

183
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:25,299
from Professor Jones'
diary, Your Highness,

184
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:26,675
and they include a map

185
00:17:26,746 --> 00:17:29,510
that pinpoints the exact
location of the Grail.

186
00:17:29,582 --> 00:17:32,176
As you can see, the Grail
is all but in our hands.

187
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:33,377
However, Your Highness,

188
00:17:33,486 --> 00:17:35,545
we would not think
of crossing your soil

189
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:36,883
without your permission,

190
00:17:36,956 --> 00:17:39,186
nor of removing the
Grail from your borders

191
00:17:39,258 --> 00:17:42,227
without suitable
compensation.

192
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:46,590
What have you brought?

193
00:17:54,707 --> 00:17:57,107
Precious valuables,
Your Highness,

194
00:17:57,176 --> 00:18:00,111
donated by some
of the finest families

195
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:02,238
in all of Germany.

196
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:06,749
Ah!

197
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:09,788
Rolls-Royce
Phantom Two.

198
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:11,345
Four-point-three liter,

199
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:13,949
30 horsepower,
six-cylinder engine,

200
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:16,688
with Stromberg
downdraft carburetor.

201
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:20,289
Can go from zero to
100 kilometers an hour

202
00:18:20,366 --> 00:18:22,698
in 12.5 seconds.

203
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,929
And I even
like the color.

204
00:18:25,004 --> 00:18:28,405
The keys are in the ignition,
Your Highness.

205
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:32,199
You shall have
camels, horses,

206
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:34,212
an armed escort, provisions,

207
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,214
desert vehicles

208
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:37,476
and tanks.

209
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:39,518
You're welcome.

210
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,533
We have no time to lose.

211
00:18:56,602 --> 00:18:59,230
Indiana Jones
and his father have escaped.

212
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,874
We go this way.

213
00:19:03,943 --> 00:19:05,501
Get that camel
out of the way.

214
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,709
What happened
to Marcus, Sallah?

215
00:19:09,782 --> 00:19:12,649
Ah, they set out across
the desert this afternoon.

216
00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:15,551
I believe they took
Mr. Brody with them.

217
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,753
Now they have the map.

218
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:22,453
And in this sort of race,

219
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:25,793
there's no silver medal
for finishing second.

220
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:50,350
Care to wet your
whistle, Marcus?

221
00:19:50,422 --> 00:19:52,390
I'd rather spit
in your face.

222
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:54,618
But as I haven't
got any spit...

223
00:19:57,296 --> 00:19:59,594
Must be within
three or four miles.

224
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:02,395
Otherwise we are
off the map.

225
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:06,899
Well, Marcus,
we are on the brink

226
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:09,099
of the recovery
of the greatest artifact

227
00:20:09,174 --> 00:20:10,573
in the history
of mankind.

228
00:20:10,643 --> 00:20:13,134
You're meddling with powers

229
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:16,079
you cannot
possibly comprehend.

230
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:24,048
Ah, I see Brody.

231
00:20:24,123 --> 00:20:26,591
He seems okay.

232
00:20:29,495 --> 00:20:31,087
They've got a tank.

233
00:20:37,102 --> 00:20:38,694
Six-pound gun.

234
00:20:38,771 --> 00:20:40,500
What do you think
you're doing there?

235
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:41,505
Get down!

236
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:44,168
Dad, we're well out of range.

237
00:20:54,286 --> 00:20:56,220
That car belonged
to my brother-in-law.

238
00:20:56,288 --> 00:20:57,550
Come on, come on!

239
00:20:57,623 --> 00:20:59,523
I can't see anyone up there.

240
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:01,321
Maybe it wasn't
even Jones.

241
00:21:01,393 --> 00:21:02,951
No, it is him,
all right.

242
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:04,723
He's here somewhere.

243
00:21:04,797 --> 00:21:07,527
Put Brody in the tank.

244
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,800
Well, in this sun,

245
00:21:17,876 --> 00:21:20,174
without transportation,
they're as good as dead.

246
00:21:29,822 --> 00:21:31,483
It's Jones, all right.

247
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:37,151
Now, who are
all these people?

248
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:38,161
Who cares?

249
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:40,164
As long as they're
keeping Donovan busy.

250
00:21:40,232 --> 00:21:42,029
Dad, you stay here
while Sallah and I

251
00:21:42,101 --> 00:21:44,160
organize some transportation.

252
00:22:08,694 --> 00:22:10,321
I'm going after those horses.

253
00:22:10,396 --> 00:22:11,328
I'll take the camels.

254
00:22:11,463 --> 00:22:12,430
I don't need camels.

255
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:13,430
But, Indy...

256
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:14,591
No camels.

257
00:22:25,477 --> 00:22:26,944
Who is he?

258
00:22:28,747 --> 00:22:31,682
A messenger from God.

259
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:34,116
For the unrighteous,

260
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:38,555
the Cup of Life
holds everlasting damnation.

261
00:22:56,975 --> 00:22:57,942
Marcus!

262
00:22:58,977 --> 00:23:00,035
Oh.

263
00:23:00,112 --> 00:23:03,240
''Genius of the Restoration...''

264
00:23:03,315 --> 00:23:06,307
''Aid our own resuscitation.''

265
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:07,647
Henry, what are you
doing here?

266
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,085
It's a rescue, old boy.
Come on.

267
00:23:15,494 --> 00:23:16,688
Search him.

268
00:23:16,762 --> 00:23:18,992
What is in this book?

269
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:22,625
That miserable
little diary of yours.

270
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:24,862
We have the map.
The book is useless.

271
00:23:24,937 --> 00:23:28,202
And yet you come all the way
back to Berlin to get it.

272
00:23:28,273 --> 00:23:29,331
Why?

273
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:32,309
What are you hiding?

274
00:23:32,377 --> 00:23:34,038
What does the diary
tell you

275
00:23:34,113 --> 00:23:36,843
that it doesn't
tell us?

276
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:40,351
It tells me that goose-stepping
morons like yourself

277
00:23:40,486 --> 00:23:44,286
should try reading books
instead of burning them.

278
00:23:44,356 --> 00:23:45,846
Colonel!

279
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:47,323
Jones is getting away.

280
00:23:47,392 --> 00:23:49,121
I think not,

281
00:23:49,194 --> 00:23:50,491
Herr Donovan.

282
00:23:50,562 --> 00:23:52,996
Not that Jones,
the other Jones!

283
00:24:02,307 --> 00:24:04,969
Sallah, I said no camels!

284
00:24:05,043 --> 00:24:06,169
That's five camels.

285
00:24:06,245 --> 00:24:07,234
Can't you count?

286
00:24:07,312 --> 00:24:09,542
Compensation for
my brother-in-law's car.

287
00:24:09,615 --> 00:24:11,810
Indy, your father
and Brody...

288
00:24:11,884 --> 00:24:13,283
Where's my father?

289
00:24:13,352 --> 00:24:14,512
They have them.

290
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:16,884
In the belly
of that steel beast.

291
00:24:19,258 --> 00:24:20,987
Hyah!

292
00:24:28,534 --> 00:24:30,024
Hyah, hyah, hyah!

293
00:24:30,102 --> 00:24:31,694
Hey-ah, hey-ah, hey-ah!

294
00:24:39,945 --> 00:24:41,071
Fire!

295
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:44,396
Dad! Dad!

296
00:26:44,469 --> 00:26:45,333
Dad!

297
00:26:45,404 --> 00:26:46,701
Junior?

298
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:48,239
Junior?!

299
00:26:48,307 --> 00:26:49,535
Junior!

300
00:28:04,216 --> 00:28:05,706
Dad!

301
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:08,577
Dad!

302
00:28:08,653 --> 00:28:10,382
Dad! Get out!

303
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:32,164
Henry, the pen...

304
00:29:32,237 --> 00:29:33,864
-What?
-But don't you see?

305
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:37,170
The pen is mightier
than the sword.

306
00:29:59,498 --> 00:30:01,056
Look what you did.

307
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:02,725
It's war.

308
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,169
Didn't I tell you
it was a rescue, huh?

309
00:31:14,506 --> 00:31:15,768
Dad!

310
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,637
Yeah?

311
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:19,540
You call this archaeology?

312
00:31:19,611 --> 00:31:20,839
Get out of there, Dad.

313
00:31:31,856 --> 00:31:33,915
How does one
get off this thing?

314
00:31:40,865 --> 00:31:41,923
Where's Marcus?

315
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:47,169
Dad!

316
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:52,770
Hang on, Dad!

317
00:31:59,217 --> 00:32:01,708
Father of Indy,
give me your hand!

318
00:32:01,786 --> 00:32:03,549
Sallah!

319
00:32:03,622 --> 00:32:04,987
Get Dad!

320
00:32:05,056 --> 00:32:06,956
Give me your hand!

321
00:32:55,507 --> 00:32:57,236
Junior!

322
00:32:59,377 --> 00:33:00,708
Indy!

323
00:33:09,921 --> 00:33:12,151
Oh, God.

324
00:33:12,223 --> 00:33:14,316
I've lost him.

325
00:33:17,362 --> 00:33:22,163
And I never told him anything.

326
00:33:22,233 --> 00:33:26,329
I just wasn't ready, Marcus.

327
00:33:26,471 --> 00:33:30,407
Five minutes
would have been enough.

328
00:34:06,077 --> 00:34:09,103
I thought
I'd lost you, boy!

329
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:12,946
I thought
you had too, sir.

330
00:34:13,017 --> 00:34:15,645
Mmm...

331
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:29,330
Well...

332
00:34:29,467 --> 00:34:32,334
Well done. Come on.

333
00:34:34,939 --> 00:34:37,305
Let's go, then.

334
00:34:38,777 --> 00:34:40,768
Why are you
sitting there resting

335
00:34:40,845 --> 00:34:42,642
when we're so near the end?!

336
00:34:42,714 --> 00:34:44,978
Come on, let's go!

337
00:34:56,928 --> 00:35:01,160
The Canyon
of the Crescent Moon.

338
00:37:28,279 --> 00:37:29,940
Helmut, another volunteer!

339
00:37:58,576 --> 00:38:01,101
I never expected
to see you again.

340
00:38:01,179 --> 00:38:04,114
I'm like a bad penny;
I always turn up.

341
00:38:04,182 --> 00:38:06,309
Step back now,
Dr. Schneider.

342
00:38:06,384 --> 00:38:08,215
Give Dr. Jones some room.

343
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:11,278
He's going to recover
the Grail for us.

344
00:38:13,324 --> 00:38:15,884
Impossible?
What do you say, Jones?

345
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,087
Ready to go down in history?

346
00:38:18,162 --> 00:38:19,356
As what?

347
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:21,091
A Nazi stooge like you?

348
00:38:21,165 --> 00:38:22,928
The Nazis?!

349
00:38:23,001 --> 00:38:25,936
Is that the limit
of your vision?

350
00:38:26,004 --> 00:38:27,835
The Nazis want
to write themselves

351
00:38:27,905 --> 00:38:29,270
into the Grail legend...

352
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:30,967
take on the world.

353
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:34,341
Well, they're welcome.

354
00:38:34,412 --> 00:38:36,937
But I want
the Grail itself.

355
00:38:37,015 --> 00:38:40,712
The cup that gives
everlasting life.

356
00:38:40,785 --> 00:38:42,116
Hitler can have
the world,

357
00:38:42,186 --> 00:38:43,744
but he can't
take it with him.

358
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:46,483
I'm going to be
drinking my own health

359
00:38:46,557 --> 00:38:49,082
when he's gone the way
of the dodo.

360
00:38:52,563 --> 00:38:53,996
The Grail is mine...

361
00:38:54,065 --> 00:38:56,499
and you're going
to get it for me.

362
00:38:56,567 --> 00:38:59,058
Shooting me
won't get you anywhere.

363
00:38:59,137 --> 00:39:01,230
You know something,
Dr. Jones?

364
00:39:01,305 --> 00:39:03,102
You're absolutely right.

365
00:39:06,077 --> 00:39:08,045
Dad?

366
00:39:08,112 --> 00:39:09,340
Dad?!

367
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,209
Junior...

368
00:39:11,282 --> 00:39:13,079
-No!
-Get back!

369
00:39:31,002 --> 00:39:33,095
You can't save him
when you're dead!

370
00:39:33,171 --> 00:39:34,536
The healing power
of the Grail

371
00:39:34,605 --> 00:39:36,869
is the only thing
that can save your father now.

372
00:39:36,941 --> 00:39:40,399
It's time to ask yourself
what you believe.

373
00:40:14,445 --> 00:40:18,939
''The Breath of God...

374
00:40:19,016 --> 00:40:22,645
...only the penitent man
will pass.''

375
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:25,655
''The penitent man will pass.

376
00:40:43,608 --> 00:40:46,372
The penitent man will pass.

377
00:40:46,477 --> 00:40:49,139
The penitent man...

378
00:40:51,582 --> 00:40:54,107
''Only the penitent man
will pass.''

379
00:40:54,185 --> 00:40:56,745
''Only the penitent
man will pass.''

380
00:40:56,821 --> 00:40:58,755
The penitent man will pass.

381
00:40:58,823 --> 00:41:00,688
The penitent, penitent...

382
00:41:00,758 --> 00:41:02,316
The penitent man...

383
00:41:02,426 --> 00:41:03,859
The penitent man...

384
00:41:03,928 --> 00:41:04,986
The penitent...

385
00:41:05,062 --> 00:41:08,088
The penitent man
is humble before God.

386
00:41:08,166 --> 00:41:09,929
Penitent. Penitent...

387
00:41:10,001 --> 00:41:11,832
The penitent man...

388
00:41:11,903 --> 00:41:15,066
Penitent man
is humble...

389
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:16,663
...kneels before God.

390
00:41:16,741 --> 00:41:17,708
Kneel!

391
00:41:26,584 --> 00:41:27,949
I'm through!

392
00:41:28,019 --> 00:41:31,580
We're through.

393
00:41:33,558 --> 00:41:35,219
He's all right.

394
00:41:35,293 --> 00:41:36,851
No.

395
00:41:36,928 --> 00:41:39,920
The second challenge:
''The Word of God.''

396
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:43,524
''Only in the footsteps
of God will he proceed.''

397
00:41:47,371 --> 00:41:49,965
The Word of God...

398
00:41:50,041 --> 00:41:51,406
The Word of...

399
00:41:54,612 --> 00:41:58,070
Proceed in the footsteps
of the Word.

400
00:41:58,149 --> 00:41:59,411
''The Word of God...''

401
00:41:59,483 --> 00:42:01,348
No, Henry.
Try not to talk.

402
00:42:07,959 --> 00:42:10,928
The name of God...

403
00:42:10,995 --> 00:42:15,989
The name of God...

404
00:42:16,067 --> 00:42:18,831
Jehovah.

405
00:42:18,903 --> 00:42:24,466
But in the Latin alphabet,
Jehovah begins with an ''I.''

406
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:26,567
J...

407
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:33,509
Oh, dear.

408
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:39,317
Idiot!

409
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:43,019
In Latin, Jehovah
starts with an ''I.''

410
00:42:44,629 --> 00:42:46,824
''I''...

411
00:42:46,898 --> 00:42:49,264
''E''...

412
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:50,857
''H''...

413
00:42:50,935 --> 00:42:52,129
''O''...

414
00:42:52,203 --> 00:42:53,135
Oh!

415
00:42:53,204 --> 00:42:55,604
''V''...

416
00:42:55,673 --> 00:42:57,197
''A''...

417
00:43:19,497 --> 00:43:21,465
''The Path of God.''

418
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:27,127
''Only in the leap
from the lion's head

419
00:43:27,204 --> 00:43:31,140
will he prove his worth.''

420
00:43:33,377 --> 00:43:38,178
lmpossible...
nobody can jump this.

421
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:41,050
Indy!

422
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:43,143
Indy, you must hurry!

423
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:44,710
Come quickly!

424
00:43:50,962 --> 00:43:53,362
It's a leap of faith.

425
00:43:53,431 --> 00:43:54,921
Oh, geez...

426
00:43:54,999 --> 00:43:57,559
You must believe, boy.

427
00:43:57,635 --> 00:43:59,933
You must... believe.

428
00:45:37,902 --> 00:45:40,029
Oh.

429
00:45:46,377 --> 00:45:48,641
I knew you'd come,

430
00:45:48,712 --> 00:45:51,306
but my strength has left me.

431
00:45:51,382 --> 00:45:53,407
Who are you?

432
00:45:53,484 --> 00:45:55,884
The last of three brothers

433
00:45:55,953 --> 00:45:58,717
who swore an oath
to find the Grail

434
00:45:58,789 --> 00:46:00,950
and to guard it.

435
00:46:01,025 --> 00:46:03,755
That was 700 years ago.

436
00:46:03,828 --> 00:46:06,695
A long time to wait.

437
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:09,960
You're strangely dressed...

438
00:46:10,034 --> 00:46:12,025
for a knight.

439
00:46:12,103 --> 00:46:14,697
I'm not exactly...

440
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:15,864
a knight.

441
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:17,237
What do you mean?

442
00:46:17,308 --> 00:46:19,503
I was chosen

443
00:46:19,577 --> 00:46:22,671
because I was the bravest,
the most worthy.

444
00:46:22,746 --> 00:46:24,680
The honor was mine

445
00:46:24,748 --> 00:46:27,308
until another came
to challenge me

446
00:46:27,384 --> 00:46:30,547
to single combat.

447
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:32,589
I pass it...

448
00:46:32,656 --> 00:46:37,753
to you who vanquished me.

449
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:41,589
Listen, I don't have
time to explain, but...

450
00:46:59,049 --> 00:47:01,244
Which one is it?

451
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:03,309
You must choose,

452
00:47:03,387 --> 00:47:05,787
but choose wisely.

453
00:47:05,856 --> 00:47:08,654
For as the true Grail
will bring you life,

454
00:47:08,726 --> 00:47:10,717
the false Grail

455
00:47:10,794 --> 00:47:12,762
will take it from you.

456
00:47:17,234 --> 00:47:20,135
I'm not a historian.

457
00:47:20,204 --> 00:47:21,637
I have no idea

458
00:47:21,705 --> 00:47:23,468
what it looks like.

459
00:47:23,541 --> 00:47:25,031
Which one is it?

460
00:47:25,109 --> 00:47:27,100
Let me choose.

461
00:47:27,178 --> 00:47:29,612
Thank you, Doctor.

462
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:44,821
Oh, yes.

463
00:47:49,433 --> 00:47:53,927
It's more beautiful
than I'd ever imagined.

464
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:08,215
This certainly is the cup
of the King of Kings.

465
00:48:14,592 --> 00:48:16,822
Eternal life.

466
00:48:51,128 --> 00:48:53,892
What is happening to me?

467
00:48:55,966 --> 00:48:57,297
Oh!

468
00:48:58,535 --> 00:49:00,901
Tell me, what is happening?

469
00:49:23,994 --> 00:49:25,928
He chose...

470
00:49:25,996 --> 00:49:28,328
poorly.

471
00:49:37,775 --> 00:49:40,437
It would not be made
out of gold.

472
00:49:40,511 --> 00:49:42,672
That's the cup
of a carpenter.

473
00:49:52,523 --> 00:49:54,684
There's only one way
to find out.

474
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:13,670
You have chosen wisely.

475
00:50:13,744 --> 00:50:18,613
But the Grail cannot pass
beyond the Great Seal.

476
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:23,517
That is the boundary
and the price of immortality.

477
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:53,107
Drop your guns. Please.

478
00:51:56,346 --> 00:51:58,109
Dad, come on,
get to your feet.

479
00:52:12,029 --> 00:52:14,623
We have got it. Come on!

480
00:52:16,133 --> 00:52:18,601
Elsa! Elsa, don't move!

481
00:52:18,669 --> 00:52:20,694
It's ours, Indy--
yours and mine.

482
00:52:20,771 --> 00:52:22,830
Elsa, don't cross the Seal.

483
00:52:22,906 --> 00:52:24,100
The knight warned us

484
00:52:24,174 --> 00:52:26,404
not to take
the Grail from here.

485
00:52:52,970 --> 00:52:53,994
Junior!

486
00:52:54,071 --> 00:52:55,470
Junior!

487
00:52:58,308 --> 00:52:58,967
Elsa...

488
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:02,668
Elsa, don't. Elsa...

489
00:53:02,746 --> 00:53:04,179
Elsa...

490
00:53:04,248 --> 00:53:05,715
Give me your other hand, honey.

491
00:53:05,782 --> 00:53:06,806
I can't hold you!

492
00:53:06,884 --> 00:53:08,249
I can reach it.

493
00:53:08,318 --> 00:53:10,013
I can reach it.

494
00:53:10,087 --> 00:53:11,816
Elsa, give me your hand.
Give me your other hand!

495
00:53:14,358 --> 00:53:15,347
Elsa!

496
00:53:25,435 --> 00:53:27,767
Junior, give me
your other hand!

497
00:53:27,838 --> 00:53:29,703
I can't hold on.

498
00:53:29,773 --> 00:53:31,035
I can get it.

499
00:53:31,108 --> 00:53:33,303
I can almost reach it, Dad.

500
00:53:33,443 --> 00:53:35,035
Indiana...

501
00:53:36,813 --> 00:53:38,041
Indiana...

502
00:53:41,418 --> 00:53:43,648
Let it go.

503
00:54:02,372 --> 00:54:04,806
Dad...

504
00:54:11,315 --> 00:54:12,907
Please, Dad.

505
00:54:44,047 --> 00:54:46,914
Elsa never really
believed in the Grail.

506
00:54:46,984 --> 00:54:49,680
She thought she'd
found a prize.

507
00:54:56,159 --> 00:54:58,559
What did you find, Dad?

508
00:54:58,629 --> 00:55:00,119
Me?

509
00:55:02,833 --> 00:55:04,357
Illumination.

510
00:55:13,877 --> 00:55:15,401
And what did you find, Junior?

511
00:55:15,479 --> 00:55:18,414
''Junior''? Dad...

512
00:55:18,482 --> 00:55:20,279
Please, what does
it always mean,

513
00:55:20,417 --> 00:55:21,679
this... this ''Junior''?

514
00:55:21,752 --> 00:55:23,879
That's his name:
Henry Jones, Junior.

515
00:55:23,954 --> 00:55:25,615
I like Indiana.

516
00:55:25,689 --> 00:55:27,054
We named the dog Indiana.

517
00:55:27,124 --> 00:55:28,523
May we go home now,

518
00:55:28,592 --> 00:55:29,854
please?

519
00:55:29,926 --> 00:55:31,086
The dog?

520
00:55:32,929 --> 00:55:34,988
You are named after the dog?

521
00:55:36,133 --> 00:55:40,399
I've got a lot of fond memories
of that dog.

522
00:55:40,470 --> 00:55:43,234
Ready?

523
00:55:43,306 --> 00:55:44,933
Ready.

524
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:46,976
Indy! Henry! Follow me.

525
00:55:47,044 --> 00:55:48,807
I know the way! Ha!

526
00:55:52,115 --> 00:55:55,448
Got lost
in his own museum, huh?

527
00:55:55,519 --> 00:55:57,282
Uh-huh.

528
00:55:57,354 --> 00:55:59,720
After you, Junior.

529
00:55:59,790 --> 00:56:01,348
Yes, sir. Ha!
