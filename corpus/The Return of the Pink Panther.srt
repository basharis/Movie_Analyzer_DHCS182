1
00:00:08,091 --> 00:00:11,223


2
00:00:24,418 --> 00:00:27,675
This way, please, ladies and gentlemen.

3
00:00:29,722 --> 00:00:31,475
Follow me.

4
00:00:34,315 --> 00:00:37,864
Round there, please. Thank you.

5
00:00:48,972 --> 00:00:53,440
From the dynasty of Akbar the Magnificent,
and for over a thousand years,

6
00:00:53,691 --> 00:00:58,033
our nation's religious symbol,
the Pink Panther;

7
00:00:58,284 --> 00:01:01,499
largest and most famous
diamond in the world.

8
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:06,051
Irreplaceable, its value cannot
be estimated in terms of money.

9
00:01:06,301 --> 00:01:09,934
Isn't the museum worried
that someone might steal it?

10
00:01:10,185 --> 00:01:15,530
The Pink Panther is protected by forces
more impenetrable than any army.

11
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:17,325
Observe.

12
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:26,136
Deactivate.

13
00:01:27,765 --> 00:01:33,903
Failing the radar shield, the slightest release
of pressure in the weight of the diamond

14
00:01:34,154 --> 00:01:40,543
and the would-be thief
is a prisoner of the Pink Panther.

15
00:01:48,352 --> 00:01:50,899
Why is it called the Pink Panther?

16
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:55,743
The stone is flawed. If it's held up
to the light in a certain way,

17
00:01:55,993 --> 00:01:59,417
the figure of a springing panther
can be seen clearly.

18
00:15:28,475 --> 00:15:31,064
- Good morning, sir.
- Sit!

19
00:15:32,442 --> 00:15:35,240
My department has several suspects.

20
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:39,290
His Majesty has been informed.
He's flying home from Washington.

21
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:42,714
- I expect an arrest any moment.
- I don't share your optimism.

22
00:15:42,965 --> 00:15:45,470
The culprit is still within our borders.

23
00:15:45,721 --> 00:15:48,936
All airports and railways stations
are being watched.

24
00:15:49,187 --> 00:15:52,611
While you search
for a man with a Dutch passport,

25
00:15:52,862 --> 00:15:55,576
he's thrown away the passport

26
00:15:55,868 --> 00:15:58,248
and will leave the country
under a new identity.

27
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:01,923
- When we find the fingerprints...
- If you find them...

28
00:16:02,174 --> 00:16:07,519
You're both in trouble.
Do what is necessary and conventional.

29
00:16:07,769 --> 00:16:10,024
I am calling outside help -

30
00:16:10,275 --> 00:16:14,659
the famous French detective who
recovered the Pink Panther the last time.

31
00:16:15,244 --> 00:16:17,248
- What was his name?
- Clouseau.

32
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,257
Inspector Clouseau.

33
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:44,558
You 'ave a licence?

34
00:16:44,808 --> 00:16:46,353
Monsieur...?

35
00:16:46,687 --> 00:16:52,742
City ordinance 47B prohibits the playing
of any musical instrument in a public place

36
00:16:52,993 --> 00:16:55,665
for the purpose of commercial enterprise
without a licence.

37
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:57,879
I don't understand.

38
00:16:58,129 --> 00:17:01,136
It is against the law for you to play
your musical instrument.

39
00:17:01,428 --> 00:17:07,441
- The law? You say it's against the law.
- Yes, unless you have a proper licence.

40
00:17:07,692 --> 00:17:11,575
- What kind of licence?
- A licence that permits

41
00:17:11,826 --> 00:17:14,957
the playing of any musical instrument
in a public place

42
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:17,421
for the purpose of commercial enterprise.

43
00:17:17,672 --> 00:17:20,261
- Commercial enterprise?
- Yes.

44
00:17:20,511 --> 00:17:25,021
- You play and people give you the money.
- People give the monkey the money.

45
00:17:25,272 --> 00:17:28,445
- It is the same.
- Not at all, monsieur.

46
00:17:28,696 --> 00:17:32,120
I am a musician
and the monkey is a businessman.

47
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:33,957
He doesn't tell me what to play.

48
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:36,463
I don't tell him what to do with his money.

49
00:17:36,713 --> 00:17:39,386
Don't try to be funny with me!

50
00:17:39,595 --> 00:17:42,100
He is your meenkey,
therefore it's your money!

51
00:17:42,351 --> 00:17:44,606
He lives with me but he is not my monkey.

52
00:17:44,856 --> 00:17:50,577
I came home and I found him in the living
room. He pays for his room and board.

53
00:17:50,827 --> 00:17:53,500
Then the meenkey is breaking the law.

54
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:57,258
But he doesn't play any musical instrument.

55
00:17:57,509 --> 00:18:01,810
City ordinance 132R prohibits the begging.

56
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:05,025
How do you know so much
about the city ordinance?

57
00:18:05,276 --> 00:18:08,324
What sort of stupid question is that?
Are you blind?

58
00:18:08,575 --> 00:18:13,460
- Yes.
- Oh, I see, yes. Yes, of course.

59
00:18:13,711 --> 00:18:16,383
You happen to be talking to a police officer,

60
00:18:16,634 --> 00:18:21,603
and because I expect to be transferred
back to the detective division,

61
00:18:21,853 --> 00:18:23,858
I'll let you off with a warning.

62
00:18:24,108 --> 00:18:25,904
Thank you, monsieur.

63
00:18:26,196 --> 00:18:30,497
- You must get yourself a proper licence!
- First thing tomorrow.

64
00:18:30,748 --> 00:18:34,214
Try to do something
about your filthy meenkey.

65
00:18:38,682 --> 00:18:41,855
Oh, one moment!

66
00:18:43,902 --> 00:18:45,363
- Arretez!

67
00:18:49,873 --> 00:18:53,005
- Idiot!
- How could I know he was the bank manager?

68
00:18:53,255 --> 00:18:55,970
- Or that the bank was being robbed (!)
- Correct.

69
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,350
What is correct?

70
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,605
I did not know the bank was being robbed

71
00:19:00,855 --> 00:19:04,112
because I was engaged in my sworn duty
as a police officer.

72
00:19:05,657 --> 00:19:07,787
You didn't even arrest the old beggar.

73
00:19:08,038 --> 00:19:12,464
There was some question as to whether
he or his meenkey was breaking the law.

74
00:19:12,715 --> 00:19:14,260
- Meenkey?
- What?

75
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:17,725
- You said meenkey!
- Correct. Chimpanzee meenkey.

76
00:19:17,976 --> 00:19:20,732
So I let them both off with a warning.

77
00:19:20,983 --> 00:19:24,240
The beggar was the lookout man
for the gang.

78
00:19:24,574 --> 00:19:29,376
Impossible. He was blind.
How can a blind man be a lookout?

79
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:33,969
- How can an idiot be a policeman?
- Simple. All he has to do is to enlist...

80
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:36,057
Shut up!

81
00:19:37,393 --> 00:19:40,525
- How do you know he was blind?
- Because he told me so.

82
00:19:40,776 --> 00:19:44,659
- He told you so. You believed him?
- I had no reason to doubt him.

83
00:19:46,872 --> 00:19:52,259
Do you believe me if I tell you that I'm not
going to get you suspended for six months?

84
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:54,138
If you say so, sir, yes.

85
00:19:54,389 --> 00:19:56,644
I'm a bigger liar than the beggar.

86
00:19:56,894 --> 00:19:59,149
You are suspended for six months,
without pay.

87
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:04,077
- Six months?
- Effective immediately. Anything to say?

88
00:20:04,327 --> 00:20:08,670
- Could you lend me 50 francs?
- Will you get out of my sight!

89
00:20:15,978 --> 00:20:19,527
My blood pressure... Idiot.

90
00:20:21,072 --> 00:20:25,832
One day, François, I'll be rid of him forever.
That'll be the day!

91
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:30,301
- Something on your mind?
- An order from the Commissioner.

92
00:20:30,551 --> 00:20:33,224
- Oh, yes?
- It concerns Clouseau.

93
00:20:33,474 --> 00:20:34,894
Go on.

94
00:20:35,144 --> 00:20:38,235
He's to be reinstated as an inspector.

95
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:40,489
What? You can't be serious.

96
00:20:41,533 --> 00:20:46,419
And he is to report immediately
to Colonel Sharki in Lugash.

97
00:20:47,463 --> 00:20:49,342
I see...

98
00:20:55,146 --> 00:20:56,859
- Sir!
- What?

99
00:20:57,109 --> 00:20:59,656
It's a birthday gift from my wife.

100
00:21:01,535 --> 00:21:05,168
- Most realistic.
- Get me the Commissioner.

101
00:21:10,263 --> 00:21:14,814
Chief Inspector Dreyfus calling.
The Commissioner...

102
00:21:16,234 --> 00:21:22,331
I have just received your instructions
to send Clouseau to Lugash,

103
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:25,546
but he's no longer with us.
I've just given him...

104
00:21:25,797 --> 00:21:27,049
But...

105
00:21:28,093 --> 00:21:31,810
Since France and Lugash
have been allies for 200 years,

106
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:34,566
it might be a mistake
to send someone who is...

107
00:21:35,944 --> 00:21:37,948
Yes, of course.

108
00:21:38,199 --> 00:21:40,412
Very good, Commissioner.

109
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:49,849
It seems the Shah of Lugash
telephoned the President personally

110
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:54,108
and asked for Clouseau
to be assigned to the case.

111
00:21:56,823 --> 00:21:59,621
- The Shah of Lugash!
- Incredible.

112
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,875
All right, François.

113
00:22:08,056 --> 00:22:10,352
The Shah of Lugash...

114
00:22:48,227 --> 00:22:49,980
Oh, good evening, madame.

115
00:22:52,402 --> 00:22:55,618
I was just reading the headlines
in your newspaper.

116
00:22:59,794 --> 00:23:01,631
Good evening.

117
00:23:10,651 --> 00:23:14,033
Cato... Cato!

118
00:25:41,271 --> 00:25:45,781
Monsieur Clouseau's residence.
One moment, please. For you.

119
00:25:46,031 --> 00:25:48,161
It's Chief Inspector Dreyfus.

120
00:26:00,981 --> 00:26:03,570
- Yes, sir?
- You're back on the force.

121
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:06,367
Come to my office immediately!

122
00:26:08,372 --> 00:26:10,000
Immediately, sir.

123
00:26:11,128 --> 00:26:14,301
Well, Cato, I'm back on the force.

124
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:24,574
You know, Cato, your freezer ambush ploy...
I really congratulate you.

125
00:26:24,824 --> 00:26:28,332
It was very, very good. But Cato...

126
00:26:29,125 --> 00:26:31,339
Your fly is undone!

127
00:26:35,013 --> 00:26:37,936
And so, my friend, are you.

128
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:54,765
Yes, my little yellow friend, I knew
the Chief would have to reconsider.

129
00:26:54,974 --> 00:26:58,690
He didn't get where he is
by ignoring a man's qualifications.

130
00:26:58,941 --> 00:27:02,114
He knows that I am unique
and, therefore, indispensable.

131
00:27:02,365 --> 00:27:04,578
We are much the same, the Chief and I.

132
00:27:04,828 --> 00:27:09,129
All great detectives
have one thing in common.

133
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:11,927
And you know what that is? Instinct!

134
00:27:12,721 --> 00:27:16,855
That rare ability to know immediately
without having to stop and reason.

135
00:27:17,105 --> 00:27:20,905
In my business it can easily mean
a difference between life and death.

136
00:27:22,742 --> 00:27:24,037
I'll get it.

137
00:27:27,461 --> 00:27:29,173
Ah, thank you.

138
00:27:31,428 --> 00:27:36,105
Yes, that split-second timing
when instinct tells you...

139
00:27:37,024 --> 00:27:39,613
That... Arghhh!

140
00:27:48,966 --> 00:27:50,845
Infamous powers are at work.

141
00:27:51,096 --> 00:27:54,854
The instant you assign me to a case, the
underworld hears about it and I am set upon.

142
00:27:55,188 --> 00:27:57,485
Cato is in hospital.

143
00:27:57,736 --> 00:28:01,703
They nearly blew his little yellow skin off.
It's amazing I am still alive.

144
00:28:01,953 --> 00:28:03,665
Amazing is not the word.

145
00:28:03,916 --> 00:28:08,133
Do I detect something in your voice
that says I'm in disfavour with you?

146
00:28:08,426 --> 00:28:11,474
Yes. I wish you were dead.

147
00:28:11,724 --> 00:28:16,276
- Of course you're entitled to your opinion.
- And you're not! Out of my sight!

148
00:28:16,527 --> 00:28:18,573
You want me to leave?

149
00:28:19,241 --> 00:28:23,500
If you're not out in five seconds,
I won't be responsible for my actions!

150
00:28:23,751 --> 00:28:27,258
Five seconds is nothing.
I can easily be out of here in three...

151
00:28:27,509 --> 00:28:30,682
- But if you really want...
- I've had enough!

152
00:28:30,933 --> 00:28:33,355
Oh, thank you very much.

153
00:28:36,529 --> 00:28:42,416
A very amusing clever little gadget,
but of course my instinct told me that...

154
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:48,931
Something the matter?
Are you not feeling well??

155
00:28:49,181 --> 00:28:52,898
My blood pressure... My pills...
You're killing me.

156
00:28:54,401 --> 00:28:56,447
Perhaps some water?

157
00:29:00,372 --> 00:29:04,715
You have a defective carafe.
Allow me to blot you. I will blot you.

158
00:29:04,966 --> 00:29:07,095
My aunt suffered from high blood pressure.

159
00:29:07,346 --> 00:29:11,438
She was attended successfully
by Dr August Ball from Nice.

160
00:29:13,609 --> 00:29:16,950
And after he attended her
for several weeks...

161
00:29:22,253 --> 00:29:26,179
Obviously out of fluid.
Would you like me to fill it for you?

162
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,946
No, just... Please, just go away.

163
00:29:34,196 --> 00:29:35,491
Yes.

164
00:29:36,117 --> 00:29:39,124
All right, Inspector. I will leave.

165
00:29:39,374 --> 00:29:43,466
But remember, I will be at your service
night or day.

166
00:29:45,011 --> 00:29:47,600
Of course, I will be on assignment in Lugash.

167
00:29:47,851 --> 00:29:50,941
Unfortunately, there is some difference
in the time.

168
00:29:52,486 --> 00:29:55,868
My watch seems to have stopped,
probably due to the explosion.

169
00:29:59,167 --> 00:30:00,754
You need a new flint.

170
00:30:02,341 --> 00:30:07,435
Well, Chief Inspector. Until we meet again
and the case is sol-ved.

171
00:30:11,569 --> 00:30:14,534
Case is sol-ved... Idiot!

172
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:36,875
Don't just stand there!

173
00:30:37,125 --> 00:30:41,050
Call a doctor,
and then help me find my nose!

174
00:30:52,951 --> 00:30:54,789
Inspector!

175
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:59,173
Very interesting museum
you have here.

176
00:31:02,305 --> 00:31:04,727
- Inspector...
- Please, say nothing.

177
00:31:04,978 --> 00:31:08,193
I prefer to investigate
the scene of the crime spontaneously.

178
00:31:08,443 --> 00:31:12,703
- It gives my instincts full rein.
- But our security measures...

179
00:31:12,953 --> 00:31:17,839
I'm sure they are very good...
but obviously not good enough.

180
00:31:27,318 --> 00:31:31,076
Very effective indeed.
The element of surprise...

181
00:31:31,327 --> 00:31:35,252
Of course I knew it was going
to happen, but nevertheless a surprise...

182
00:31:35,503 --> 00:31:36,881
How kind of you to welcome me!

183
00:31:46,067 --> 00:31:49,742
Is there any way of getting
in and out without this?

184
00:31:49,993 --> 00:31:53,709
- Deactivate.
- Deactivate the door.

185
00:32:06,236 --> 00:32:07,823
Yes...

186
00:32:19,515 --> 00:32:21,520
So we meet again.

187
00:33:01,106 --> 00:33:02,902
Very ingenious.

188
00:33:03,152 --> 00:33:05,407
He pulled himself across the floor.

189
00:33:05,699 --> 00:33:08,831
- He did?
- How else could he avoid the radar field?

190
00:33:10,042 --> 00:33:15,680
Yes, how else? Of course, he would
need a very slippery floor for that.

191
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:18,853
- Therefore the wax.
- The wax?

192
00:33:21,484 --> 00:33:23,112
Are you all right?

193
00:33:23,363 --> 00:33:27,163
Of course I am!
I am examining the wax!

194
00:33:31,882 --> 00:33:33,928
Have you taken a sample of this wax?

195
00:33:34,638 --> 00:33:36,308
Wax is wax.

196
00:33:36,558 --> 00:33:40,400
This is where you are wrong.
Wax is not just wax.

197
00:33:40,651 --> 00:33:42,321
In this case it is a clue.

198
00:33:42,572 --> 00:33:46,037
English wax, French wax, domestic wax...

199
00:33:46,413 --> 00:33:50,840
The inspector is right.
Have the wax tested immediately.

200
00:33:52,009 --> 00:33:55,600
It is my guess you'll find it is English wax.

201
00:33:55,851 --> 00:33:59,191
- Why?
- Because your thief is an Englishman.

202
00:33:59,442 --> 00:34:00,736
How do you know?

203
00:34:01,655 --> 00:34:03,743
It is my business to know that.

204
00:34:03,993 --> 00:34:06,749
He is Sir Charles Phantom,
the notorious Litton...

205
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,672
- The Phantom?
- Yes, one and the same.

206
00:34:14,475 --> 00:34:16,562
His calling card...

207
00:34:17,398 --> 00:34:21,281
Four years ago,
Sir Charles vanished. It was rumoured...

208
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:29,340
..he'd given up his life of crime, but my
instinct told me he wouldn't hide long.

209
00:34:29,591 --> 00:34:34,351
- Four years is not long?
- Time is not the issue, this glove is.

210
00:34:34,602 --> 00:34:37,274
It signifies the Phantom
is up to his old tricks.

211
00:34:37,525 --> 00:34:40,531
But I will catch him. I will root him out.

212
00:34:40,782 --> 00:34:44,123
It won't be easy. He's a master of disguise.

213
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:48,841
Undoubtedly he is gone back
into hiding until the heat is off.

214
00:35:44,003 --> 00:35:46,008
How is he?

215
00:35:46,258 --> 00:35:47,887
Unlovable.

216
00:35:58,076 --> 00:35:59,663
Has he seen it?

217
00:35:59,913 --> 00:36:02,126
I thought you'd like to show it to him.

218
00:36:38,414 --> 00:36:40,710
- How was Paris?
- Expensive.

219
00:36:40,961 --> 00:36:42,924
Good. Buy anything foolish?

220
00:36:43,174 --> 00:36:45,137
Lots. How have you been?

221
00:36:45,387 --> 00:36:47,392
Splendid. Fantastic.

222
00:36:47,642 --> 00:36:53,405
I have created something absolutely
extraordinary since breakfast.

223
00:36:53,655 --> 00:36:55,785
- Can I see it?
- No, not yet.

224
00:36:56,036 --> 00:36:59,084
Please, don't be silly. Let me see it.

225
00:37:05,013 --> 00:37:06,851
How about that?

226
00:37:07,227 --> 00:37:09,649
- You know what?
- What?

227
00:37:09,899 --> 00:37:12,321
I think I came back just in time.

228
00:37:28,774 --> 00:37:30,987
Damn!

229
00:37:31,237 --> 00:37:33,701
- What, darling?
- Listen to this.

230
00:37:33,952 --> 00:37:38,253
"Police today were conducting
a house-to-house search of Lugash

231
00:37:38,503 --> 00:37:44,475
"for the thief who stole the Pink Panther
diamond from the Royal Museum.

232
00:37:44,725 --> 00:37:50,697
"The only clue is a white monogrammed
man's glove with the initial 'P'."

233
00:37:51,949 --> 00:37:53,703
What do you think?

234
00:37:53,954 --> 00:37:58,296
That you didn't spend your time
just painting during my absence.

235
00:37:58,547 --> 00:38:01,428
Oh, you think I had something to do with it?

236
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:03,015
Didn't you?

237
00:38:03,266 --> 00:38:08,444
You little beast! Three - no, four years ago -
I swore to you that I was retired.

238
00:38:09,571 --> 00:38:11,575
I've been faithful to you ever since.

239
00:38:11,826 --> 00:38:14,373
In your fashion.

240
00:38:14,624 --> 00:38:18,215
- What the hell does that mean?
- That you're being teased.

241
00:38:18,465 --> 00:38:20,595
I believe you, darling,

242
00:38:20,846 --> 00:38:24,604
but it does sound the kind of job
only the Phantom could've done.

243
00:38:24,854 --> 00:38:26,984
I mean, the Pink Panther.

244
00:38:27,652 --> 00:38:30,366
No clues
except your well-known calling card.

245
00:38:31,202 --> 00:38:35,377
Yes, I must admit...
The impostor is very clever...

246
00:38:35,628 --> 00:38:37,632
very clever indeed.

247
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:42,226
I'm surprised half the police force of France
hasn't descended on us.

248
00:38:42,476 --> 00:38:45,650
- But of course they will!
- Without a doubt.

249
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:47,696
But if you're innocent?

250
00:38:47,947 --> 00:38:49,742
I'm not only innocent,

251
00:38:49,993 --> 00:38:54,168
but if I decided to get back into business,
I wouldn't leave my calling card!

252
00:38:54,419 --> 00:38:58,302
- But will the police think of that?
- No.

253
00:38:58,595 --> 00:39:04,316
- But you can convince them.
- Not unless the real thief is caught.

254
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:07,197
But then you're lost!

255
00:39:07,447 --> 00:39:12,792
If the police think you're the real thief,
then who will catch the impostor?

256
00:39:17,386 --> 00:39:21,812
Well, I...I can only think
of one person, really. Can't you?

257
00:39:22,063 --> 00:39:23,816
Charles!

258
00:39:25,027 --> 00:39:28,201
Since the alternative is prison,
I don't have much choice.

259
00:39:28,869 --> 00:39:32,961
 I'm frightened.
This impostor is very clever.

260
00:39:33,212 --> 00:39:35,216
It could be dangerous.

261
00:39:36,219 --> 00:39:39,768
Oh, darling, not to worry.

262
00:39:40,018 --> 00:39:41,355
Trust me.

263
00:39:41,605 --> 00:39:44,904
I may be a bit rusty, but I'm
capable of taking care of myself.

264
00:40:16,139 --> 00:40:20,357
I congratulate you, Chief,
on your excellent facilities.

265
00:40:20,607 --> 00:40:25,242
Of course, you understand that my visit
must be of the utmost secrecy.

266
00:40:25,493 --> 00:40:28,499
Of course. My department will do
everything possible to assist you.

267
00:40:30,086 --> 00:40:34,554
However, there is one question
that only you can answer.

268
00:40:34,805 --> 00:40:36,308
Oui?

269
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:44,284
Does Sir Charles Litton
have a swimming pouil??

270
00:40:44,534 --> 00:40:46,998
A swimming "pouil"...?

271
00:40:52,092 --> 00:40:55,141
- Back before you know it.
- Take care.

272
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:16,521
What identity will you travel under?

273
00:41:16,771 --> 00:41:23,244
Well, I shall be dreary old Sir Charles Litton
leaving the country and...

274
00:41:24,497 --> 00:41:31,178
..fearless, dashing young Dr Marvin Tanny
arriving at Lugash.

275
00:41:33,015 --> 00:41:34,811
Watch it!

276
00:42:24,210 --> 00:42:25,797
I have the report.

277
00:42:26,048 --> 00:42:28,887
Someone has trifled with your brakes.

278
00:42:29,179 --> 00:42:33,272
The underworld will stop at nothing.
This is the second attempt on my life...

279
00:42:33,522 --> 00:42:36,905
I may have caught my...death of...

280
00:42:44,922 --> 00:42:46,634
Gesundheit.

281
00:44:38,629 --> 00:44:44,308
I have fixed your doorbell from the ringing.
There is no charge.

282
00:44:44,558 --> 00:44:47,147
Thank you. What do you want?

283
00:44:47,398 --> 00:44:51,532
I am from the telephurn company. There's
something the matter with your phurn.

284
00:44:51,782 --> 00:44:54,371
- My "phurn"?
- What?

285
00:44:54,622 --> 00:44:57,211
You said there's something the matter
with my phurn.

286
00:44:57,461 --> 00:44:58,756
Yes.

287
00:44:59,006 --> 00:45:02,806
- My phone?
- Correct. That is what I've been saying.

288
00:45:03,057 --> 00:45:05,145
There's no trouble with our telephones.

289
00:45:05,395 --> 00:45:08,360
I know when there is a trouble!

290
00:45:08,987 --> 00:45:13,413
And I can definitely tell you that
there is a trouble, rest assured of that.

291
00:45:13,663 --> 00:45:17,463
- Since when?
- Since it was reported.

292
00:45:17,714 --> 00:45:20,303
I see. What is the trouble with it?

293
00:45:20,553 --> 00:45:24,980
If I knew that I could simply call you up
and tell you what the trouble is.

294
00:45:25,230 --> 00:45:29,782
- What's the trouble?
- He says we have trouble with our phones.

295
00:45:30,033 --> 00:45:32,037
Allow me to introduce myself.

296
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:34,876
I'm Emile Flournoy, communications expert

297
00:45:35,169 --> 00:45:38,384
and chief troubleshooter
for the Nice Telephurn company.

298
00:45:38,635 --> 00:45:40,681
Oh, please come in, monsieur.

299
00:45:56,674 --> 00:45:58,553
How can we help you?

300
00:45:59,764 --> 00:46:02,144
Which is your nearest phurn?

301
00:46:02,812 --> 00:46:06,779
- There.
- What? Ah, yes...

302
00:46:09,368 --> 00:46:10,830
Hmm...

303
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:14,171
Yes, this phurn will not do at all.

304
00:46:14,421 --> 00:46:17,094
Show me another phurn.

305
00:46:17,344 --> 00:46:19,098
Show Monsieur Flo...

306
00:46:19,348 --> 00:46:20,977
Flournoy.

307
00:46:21,228 --> 00:46:24,401
Flournoy...the telephone
in Sir Charles' study.

308
00:46:28,118 --> 00:46:30,206
I hope you locate the trouble.

309
00:46:30,456 --> 00:46:33,296
It is my business to locate trouble.

310
00:46:37,931 --> 00:46:39,935
No trouble back there.

311
00:46:40,186 --> 00:46:43,568
- If you require anything...
- What I require is a phurn,

312
00:46:43,819 --> 00:46:47,994
my little bag of tools
and some privacy in which to work.

313
00:46:48,245 --> 00:46:50,082
That is all I require!

314
00:47:42,029 --> 00:47:44,910
Take that phone but don't pick it up
until I tell you.

315
00:48:42,453 --> 00:48:45,710
Raymond??
Si...

316
00:48:47,046 --> 00:48:52,600
I'm taking the five o'clock
plane to Switzerland. Have you got that??

317
00:48:52,850 --> 00:48:54,980
Si, Switzerland.

318
00:48:55,230 --> 00:48:58,989
- Have you got the merchandise?
- Si.

319
00:48:59,239 --> 00:49:05,503
Good. I see you tomorrow
at the Palace Hotel in Gstaad.

320
00:49:05,753 --> 00:49:08,635
- Si.
- Goodbye.

321
00:49:08,885 --> 00:49:11,182
Si... Goodbye.

322
00:49:28,971 --> 00:49:30,391
Inspector?

323
00:49:30,641 --> 00:49:32,228
Do not come in!

324
00:49:32,478 --> 00:49:36,111
I am making final delicate adjustments
to the phurn.

325
00:49:36,362 --> 00:49:39,243
I will tell you
when it's safe to enter.

326
00:49:46,133 --> 00:49:50,100
These adjustments must not
be interfered with, you know.

327
00:50:16,950 --> 00:50:20,249
Do not come in!
I'm just putting my tools away.

328
00:50:43,133 --> 00:50:48,979
As I summarised, a slight malfunction
with your phurn which I have repaired.

329
00:50:51,150 --> 00:50:55,785
I must return to my office
and report my adjustments.

330
00:51:32,866 --> 00:51:38,086
According to the authorities in Nice,
he's demolished a pool and two trucks.

331
00:51:38,336 --> 00:51:40,717
And he is on his way to Gstaad.

332
00:51:40,967 --> 00:51:42,262
Gstaad?

333
00:51:42,512 --> 00:51:47,607
Yes. Today, a paradise in the Swiss Alps,
tomorrow, a wasteland.

334
00:51:50,070 --> 00:51:56,000
Compared to Clouseau,
Attila the Hun was a Red Cross volunteer.

335
00:52:00,009 --> 00:52:01,846
- Careful!
- What?

336
00:52:02,974 --> 00:52:05,479
I put the real one in the bottom drawer.

337
00:53:02,353 --> 00:53:04,650
Follow that car!

338
00:53:36,052 --> 00:53:38,599
Do you know the way to the Palace Hotel??

339
00:53:38,850 --> 00:53:40,144
Yes.

340
00:54:07,996 --> 00:54:09,792
Your bag, sir?

341
00:54:10,043 --> 00:54:13,592
No, thank you.
This bag never leaves my hand.

342
00:54:50,088 --> 00:54:51,675
He-he-he.

343
00:54:54,181 --> 00:54:55,642
Arghh!

344
00:55:05,789 --> 00:55:07,668
Your bag, sir.

345
00:55:09,798 --> 00:55:11,468
Thank you.

346
00:55:13,807 --> 00:55:16,772
Scusi, signore. May I take your coat?

347
00:55:17,314 --> 00:55:19,319
Thank you very much.

348
00:55:21,991 --> 00:55:24,580
- Your gloves?
- Of course.

349
00:55:26,668 --> 00:55:28,088
Your hat?

350
00:55:28,422 --> 00:55:30,677
- Grazie, signor.
- Prego.

351
00:55:54,562 --> 00:55:56,024
Oui, monsieur?

352
00:55:56,274 --> 00:55:58,738
- Do you have a rheum?
- A "rheum"...?

353
00:55:58,989 --> 00:56:01,912
- What?
- You said, do I have a "rheum".

354
00:56:02,162 --> 00:56:05,795
I know what I said!
I said, "Do you have a rheum?"

355
00:56:07,048 --> 00:56:09,219
You mean, do I have a room?

356
00:56:09,470 --> 00:56:11,433
That's what I have been saying, you fool!

357
00:56:12,852 --> 00:56:15,149
Do you have a reservation?

358
00:56:19,784 --> 00:56:22,540
I am Inspector Clouseau of the Surete.

359
00:56:23,709 --> 00:56:26,090
I am here on official police business.

360
00:56:26,340 --> 00:56:32,437
Whether it's official or not, this is the height
of the season and the hotel is full.

361
00:56:32,980 --> 00:56:34,608
Listen, my friend.

362
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:37,656
This is a matter of national importance.

363
00:56:37,907 --> 00:56:40,245
If you continue to be difficult,

364
00:56:40,496 --> 00:56:43,670
I shall have to speak with my superiors.

365
00:56:47,553 --> 00:56:49,641
In that case, monsieur...

366
00:56:51,019 --> 00:56:53,274
We do have...a rheum.

367
00:56:54,067 --> 00:56:56,280
I thought as much.

368
00:57:19,038 --> 00:57:22,964
Nature of your visit to Lugash, Dr Tanny?
Business or pleasure?

369
00:57:23,214 --> 00:57:25,219
Purely pleasure.

370
00:58:07,269 --> 00:58:09,273
How are you, Pepi?

371
00:58:10,609 --> 00:58:14,034
What a surprise! Sir Charles Litton, isn't it?

372
00:58:14,284 --> 00:58:18,042
Not necessarily. A cognac, s'ilvous plait.

373
00:58:18,919 --> 00:58:23,638
Well... Where do I find the Fat Man?

374
00:58:23,888 --> 00:58:27,688
Oh, I haven't seen the Fat Man in years.

375
00:58:27,981 --> 00:58:29,317
Really?

376
00:58:33,075 --> 00:58:35,455
If you're not working for the Fat Man,

377
00:58:35,706 --> 00:58:37,710
who are you working for?

378
00:58:38,170 --> 00:58:42,178
- You're breaking my finger!
- Why don't you call a policeman?

379
00:58:44,099 --> 00:58:48,525
All right, you can find the Fat Man
at the Salamander.

380
00:58:48,776 --> 00:58:50,572
Thank you, Pepi.

381
00:58:51,824 --> 00:58:56,668
Why don't you order yourself
some liniment...on the rocks?

382
01:00:10,246 --> 01:00:14,045
Well, Charles, my old friend!

383
01:00:14,505 --> 01:00:16,802
It's good to see you.

384
01:00:17,637 --> 01:00:20,309
Come, sit down. I've really missed you.

385
01:00:20,518 --> 01:00:24,276
You look wonderful! What can I do for you?

386
01:00:24,527 --> 01:00:27,742
Well, I need a favour, old man.

387
01:00:27,993 --> 01:00:33,087
Of course! First, I need your help.
And my two associates.

388
01:00:33,338 --> 01:00:36,344
They are here to guard the Pink Panther.

389
01:00:36,595 --> 01:00:39,184
When you've finished your drink,
hand it over.

390
01:00:39,434 --> 01:00:41,480
I haven't got it.

391
01:00:41,731 --> 01:00:44,821
- But you took it.
- I wish I had.

392
01:00:45,072 --> 01:00:46,951
But I didn't, I swear.

393
01:00:47,243 --> 01:00:52,671
Normally I detest violence, but in your case
I'm forced to make a regrettable exception.

394
01:00:53,632 --> 01:00:55,511
Would it upset you too much to explain why?

395
01:00:55,762 --> 01:00:58,935
Under the pretence
of trying to catch the thief,

396
01:00:59,186 --> 01:01:01,858
the General is hurting many innocent people.

397
01:01:02,109 --> 01:01:03,988
And a group of my friends.

398
01:01:04,238 --> 01:01:06,953
If I give him the thief,
he'll stop hurting them.

399
01:01:07,955 --> 01:01:12,966
Of course, if you didn't steal the Panther,
one might almost conclude

400
01:01:13,216 --> 01:01:17,768
that the General, in order to get rid of his
political enemies, did it himself.

401
01:01:18,018 --> 01:01:20,065
I bet he even offered a reward.

402
01:01:20,315 --> 01:01:22,528
A very considerable reward. Dead...

403
01:01:22,779 --> 01:01:25,451
- Or alive?
- And if you are dead...

404
01:01:25,702 --> 01:01:30,546
- I can't prove I didn't steal it.
- I knew you'd figure it out.

405
01:01:30,796 --> 01:01:34,304
Deliver the body to the general
with my compliments.

406
01:01:34,555 --> 01:01:37,979
I'm awfully sorry, old boy.

407
01:01:39,649 --> 01:01:45,078
You know the old saying: "With friends
like you, who needs enemies?"

408
01:03:17,404 --> 01:03:21,037
- Good evening, Dr Tanny.
- Good evening.

409
01:03:21,288 --> 01:03:23,417
I am Colonel Sharki.

410
01:03:24,085 --> 01:03:29,681
Ah, yes. I thought we might be running
into one another sooner or later.

411
01:03:31,309 --> 01:03:34,608
I...I need your help.

412
01:03:37,197 --> 01:03:42,542
Now, Colonel Sharki,
what could a simple doctor do

413
01:03:42,793 --> 01:03:46,050
to help the head
of the Lugash Secret Police?

414
01:03:46,342 --> 01:03:48,514
A simple doctor, nothing...

415
01:03:48,764 --> 01:03:53,775
But the notorious Phantom -
oh, he could do quite a bit.

416
01:03:54,026 --> 01:03:55,988
For instance?

417
01:03:56,281 --> 01:04:00,749
I want your co-operation
in the recovery of the Pink Panther.

418
01:04:00,999 --> 01:04:02,795
The Fat Man thinks

419
01:04:03,045 --> 01:04:05,050
that you cooked up this robbery

420
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:09,351
as an excuse to do
a little political house-cleaning.

421
01:04:11,647 --> 01:04:15,614
The Fat Man is not
the only one with that opinion.

422
01:04:15,865 --> 01:04:19,874
 If you can prove
that you're not guilty... Bad leg?

423
01:04:20,124 --> 01:04:21,878
It's nothing.

424
01:04:22,129 --> 01:04:26,263
If you can prove that you're not guilty,
then I am in serious trouble.

425
01:04:26,513 --> 01:04:29,311
Because of the religious significance
of the Pink Panther,

426
01:04:29,562 --> 01:04:34,280
it is imperative that, sooner or later, the thief
be apprehended and the jewel returned.

427
01:04:34,573 --> 01:04:37,161
But you would prefer it to be later?

428
01:04:38,874 --> 01:04:43,258
It's reassuring to know that
we understand each other so well.

429
01:04:44,386 --> 01:04:46,849
And if I do indeed...

430
01:04:47,142 --> 01:04:49,230
catch the thief?

431
01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:53,322
Oh, I have
every confidence that you will.

432
01:04:54,282 --> 01:05:00,588
 How does the saying go?
"Set a thief to catch a thief"?

433
01:05:03,093 --> 01:05:05,097
Good night, Dr...Tanny.

434
01:05:43,932 --> 01:05:46,271
Yes. I hate him all right.

435
01:05:46,521 --> 01:05:48,400
How much do you hate him?

436
01:05:48,651 --> 01:05:53,077
How much? How high is up?
I hate every molecule in his body!

437
01:05:53,328 --> 01:05:56,209
- You'd like to kill him?
- Kill him?

438
01:05:56,460 --> 01:05:58,965
Oh, God, yes...to kill him!

439
01:05:59,216 --> 01:06:00,886
Why don't you?

440
01:06:01,136 --> 01:06:04,978
Oh, to kill him...! What? Why don't I?

441
01:06:05,229 --> 01:06:07,233
It's not so easy. You try.

442
01:06:07,484 --> 01:06:10,156
- I mean kill him psychically.
- Ridiculous!

443
01:06:10,365 --> 01:06:14,457
There's nothing I can do "psychically"
that would have any effect on him.

444
01:06:14,708 --> 01:06:18,007
- Why not?
- Because he's got a brain of a meenkey.

445
01:06:18,257 --> 01:06:20,262
- Meenkey?
- What?

446
01:06:20,512 --> 01:06:22,475
You said "meenkey".

447
01:06:22,725 --> 01:06:26,316
I did?! Hmm-mm!
I'm beginning to talk like him!

448
01:06:26,567 --> 01:06:31,703
No, Doctor. You come up with a better
suggestion or I'll get another analyst.

449
01:06:31,954 --> 01:06:34,167
Just relax.

450
01:06:34,459 --> 01:06:38,301
Relax? I haven't slept for a week.

451
01:06:39,345 --> 01:06:44,565
I just lie there, thinking the same thoughts
over and over and over again.

452
01:06:44,815 --> 01:06:49,910
Describe your thoughts. Get them out
and you'll feel much better.

453
01:06:50,954 --> 01:06:57,760
It's always the same. Clouseau is sitting
just like you with his back to me and...

454
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:05,611
..and then suddenly my hands go around
his throat and I begin to squeeze.

455
01:07:05,861 --> 01:07:09,828
It's wonderful, it's marvellous. I'm squeezing.

456
01:07:10,079 --> 01:07:15,298
And the more I squeeze,
the freer I feel. I'm in ecstasy.

457
01:07:18,054 --> 01:07:22,147
And then suddenly...
suddenly my problem is sol-ved.

458
01:07:25,195 --> 01:07:27,074
Doctor? Doctor!

459
01:07:28,369 --> 01:07:33,463
Sir Charles arrived at my office and
we reviewed all the evidence to date.

460
01:07:33,714 --> 01:07:36,678
He was interested,
asked all the right questions.

461
01:07:36,929 --> 01:07:41,021
I showed him the film
from the museum's hidden cameras.

462
01:07:41,272 --> 01:07:44,946
This was the last group
to go through before the robbery.

463
01:07:45,197 --> 01:07:48,371
- Do you recognise anybody?
- No.

464
01:07:50,250 --> 01:07:54,759
He studied the film carefully
and claimed not to recognise anyone.

465
01:07:55,010 --> 01:07:56,263
No.

466
01:07:56,513 --> 01:07:59,353
We questioned him
three times about each one.

467
01:07:59,603 --> 01:08:02,109
You're sure?
Absolutely.

468
01:08:02,359 --> 01:08:04,698
This one?
No.

469
01:08:04,948 --> 01:08:08,206
How about that one?
No!

470
01:08:08,456 --> 01:08:10,669
The results were identical.

471
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:15,263
Little or no stress until a question
about number three, then hard stress.

472
01:08:15,513 --> 01:08:19,397
- Number three?
- A young man. The guide remembers him.

473
01:08:47,917 --> 01:08:51,801
- Good morning.
- It could be better.

474
01:08:52,051 --> 01:08:55,768
- How?
- You could go away.

475
01:08:56,018 --> 01:08:57,856
All right. But first I need your truck.

476
01:08:58,106 --> 01:09:00,820
I haven't got a truck any more... Aiee!

477
01:09:01,990 --> 01:09:03,785
I sold it.

478
01:09:05,163 --> 01:09:10,091
- Wh-what do you want it for?
- You'll help me cross the border.

479
01:09:10,341 --> 01:09:12,638
It's impossible, the border is closed!

480
01:09:12,888 --> 01:09:16,313
Aieee! ..You have to have a special pass.

481
01:09:16,605 --> 01:09:19,528
- Get one.
- Out of the question!

482
01:09:19,820 --> 01:09:24,748
If I go to the Fat Man to buy a special pass,
he wants to know the reason.

483
01:09:24,998 --> 01:09:30,385
Then tell him I've threatened your life
unless you help me cross the border.

484
01:09:30,635 --> 01:09:36,398
Tell him that for half the sum of the reward,
plus a forged pass for you,

485
01:09:36,649 --> 01:09:38,987
you will deliver me into an ambush

486
01:09:39,238 --> 01:09:43,831
at some pre-named place of the Fat Man's
choosing this side of the border.

487
01:09:44,833 --> 01:09:49,134
- What if he doesn't believe me?
- I'm sure you can convince him.

488
01:09:51,473 --> 01:09:54,521
And if, my dear Pepi, you double-cross me,

489
01:09:54,771 --> 01:09:58,905
it'll be a very long while
before you give your next piano recital.

490
01:10:16,360 --> 01:10:19,409
- Yes?
- You asked about Lady Litton's activities.

491
01:10:19,659 --> 01:10:22,457
- Yes?
- She's going skiing at two o'clock.

492
01:10:22,707 --> 01:10:24,545
Skiing in this weather?

493
01:10:24,795 --> 01:10:27,050
- On the glacier.
- On the glacier?

494
01:10:27,301 --> 01:10:31,059
Psst! How long have you been a bellboy?

495
01:10:31,310 --> 01:10:33,105
Too long, monsieur.

496
01:10:33,356 --> 01:10:38,116
Keep up this good work and very soon
I'll see to it that you become a bellman.

497
01:10:50,476 --> 01:10:52,690
- Bonjour, m'lady.
- Good afternoon.

498
01:10:52,940 --> 01:10:56,573
I've changed my mind.
I'm going to the tennis matches instead.

499
01:10:56,824 --> 01:11:00,039
If my husband calls,
tell him I'll be back around four.

500
01:11:00,289 --> 01:11:02,377
- Oui, madame.
- Thank you.

501
01:11:12,483 --> 01:11:16,283
Hello. Guten Ta-a-ag.

502
01:11:47,058 --> 01:11:49,104
Hello. Wie geht's?

503
01:11:49,355 --> 01:11:50,733
Wie geht's??

504
01:14:59,144 --> 01:15:00,522
Schwein bird!

505
01:15:00,773 --> 01:15:03,821
That is my private moustache. Naughty bird!

506
01:15:09,041 --> 01:15:10,377
Schwein!

507
01:18:37,955 --> 01:18:41,045
No, no, wait! It's me, Inspector Clouseau!

508
01:18:41,296 --> 01:18:44,135
She's coming! In the elevator!

509
01:19:16,623 --> 01:19:18,293
Hello?

510
01:20:21,723 --> 01:20:24,271
What are we... What are we going to do?

511
01:20:24,521 --> 01:20:26,108
Sh! Never fear...

512
01:20:33,165 --> 01:20:35,545
She's coming!

513
01:20:46,486 --> 01:20:47,822
Come in.

514
01:20:51,204 --> 01:20:53,292
Some towels you have, bitte?

515
01:20:53,543 --> 01:20:55,171
I'll get them.

516
01:22:17,810 --> 01:22:19,814
What are you doing?!

517
01:22:20,065 --> 01:22:22,779
Wie geht's? Staubsauger!

518
01:22:26,746 --> 01:22:30,212
Halt! Out! Schnell, schnell!

519
01:22:58,941 --> 01:23:00,570
Go on!

520
01:23:01,614 --> 01:23:03,911
Guten tag! Wie geht's?

521
01:23:24,288 --> 01:23:29,132
- What took you so long?
- The Fat Man doesn't convince easily.

522
01:23:29,383 --> 01:23:32,431
- But you managed.
- Here is your pass.

523
01:23:33,893 --> 01:23:36,440
And...you gave him?

524
01:23:36,691 --> 01:23:42,578
As you suggested, for the pass and half
of the reward, I will hand you over.

525
01:23:42,829 --> 01:23:45,752
- Quickly, we must hurry.
- Where?

526
01:23:46,003 --> 01:23:48,842
- What?
- Where did you agree to hand me over?

527
01:23:49,093 --> 01:23:55,148
The Fat Man will be waiting one mile south
of the roadway, seven miles from the border.

528
01:23:55,398 --> 01:23:57,611
I know the place precisely!

529
01:23:57,862 --> 01:24:01,328
I will avoid it, absolutely. We must hurry!

530
01:24:02,956 --> 01:24:04,376
After you.

531
01:24:04,627 --> 01:24:06,589
- What?
- Try "why".

532
01:24:06,840 --> 01:24:08,426
Why? Aieee!

533
01:24:09,303 --> 01:24:13,730
Because I know you precisely
and doubt you absolutely.

534
01:24:13,980 --> 01:24:16,068
Sir Charles, please, please...

535
01:24:16,319 --> 01:24:20,495
As long as you've told the truth,
there's nothing to worry about.

536
01:24:20,745 --> 01:24:23,877
- Nothing to worry about...
- Right.

537
01:24:24,963 --> 01:24:27,719
- Be careful.
- Thank you very much.

538
01:26:23,095 --> 01:26:24,682
Open it.

539
01:26:27,522 --> 01:26:29,192
Be careful!

540
01:26:33,785 --> 01:26:35,748
He tricked me!

541
01:27:12,829 --> 01:27:15,209
From the gentleman at the bar, madame.

542
01:27:53,251 --> 01:27:56,842
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

543
01:27:58,387 --> 01:28:00,433
Monsieur Guy Gadbois

544
01:28:00,683 --> 01:28:02,521
at your service.

545
01:28:02,938 --> 01:28:06,613
- How do you do? I'm Lady Litton.
- Yes, I know.

546
01:28:06,864 --> 01:28:10,079
I took the liberty of finding out.
I hope you're not offended.

547
01:28:10,330 --> 01:28:15,340
- That depends on your intentions.
- Strictly honourable, I can assure you.

548
01:28:15,591 --> 01:28:21,896
A man sees a beautiful chick and
can't help but be inquisitive, you know.

549
01:28:23,358 --> 01:28:27,784
- You think me naughty if I buy you a drink?
- You already have.

550
01:28:29,496 --> 01:28:32,085
I know that.

551
01:28:32,336 --> 01:28:36,052
How about I buy myself one
and we drink it together?

552
01:28:39,518 --> 01:28:44,153
Waiter, another Kahlua
and ginger ale, please.

553
01:28:47,536 --> 01:28:53,925
Well, if there is a Lady Litton,
there must be a lurd.

554
01:28:54,175 --> 01:28:56,555
- A what?
- Lurd Litton?

555
01:28:56,848 --> 01:28:58,560
Oh, yes, he's in...

556
01:28:58,810 --> 01:29:00,147
Yes?

557
01:29:00,397 --> 01:29:02,861
- ..in plastics.
- Oh, the plastic?

558
01:29:03,111 --> 01:29:07,037
In...industrial plastics.

559
01:29:07,287 --> 01:29:10,294
Ah... Very interesting.

560
01:29:18,854 --> 01:29:20,650
Well...

561
01:29:21,902 --> 01:29:24,867
Here is looking at you, kid.

562
01:29:45,496 --> 01:29:48,878
- You have anything to declare?
- Nothing.

563
01:29:49,170 --> 01:29:51,175
You may proceed.

564
01:30:08,379 --> 01:30:10,091
I come here often

565
01:30:10,341 --> 01:30:13,390
for the winter sports, for the skiing.

566
01:30:13,640 --> 01:30:16,396
So do I. Why have we never met?

567
01:30:16,647 --> 01:30:20,196
It's simple, really. I get up at the crack of...

568
01:30:20,447 --> 01:30:22,618
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

569
01:30:22,869 --> 01:30:24,957
I get up at the crack of dawn always,

570
01:30:25,207 --> 01:30:27,880
up the mountain,
down the slopes, on the piste.

571
01:30:28,130 --> 01:30:30,176
You must be a very good skier.

572
01:30:30,427 --> 01:30:34,143
Well, I started
when I was a mere babe-in-arms.

573
01:30:34,394 --> 01:30:36,983
I could ski before I could even crawl.

574
01:30:41,075 --> 01:30:44,082
- I'm terribly sorry.
- It's all right.

575
01:30:44,374 --> 01:30:47,297
This hotel is deteriorating rapidly.

576
01:30:48,216 --> 01:30:51,807
- Your health.
- Here's to you, Monsieur Gadbois.

577
01:30:55,649 --> 01:30:58,071
Is that your own parrot?

578
01:30:58,321 --> 01:31:00,117
No, it comes with the hotel.

579
01:31:00,701 --> 01:31:04,251
Someone let it out of its cage
and I can't get it back in.

580
01:31:04,501 --> 01:31:06,297
You need another glass.

581
01:31:06,548 --> 01:31:09,888
I most certainly do. Swine parrot!

582
01:31:10,807 --> 01:31:13,229
What is it you do, Monsieur Gadbois?

583
01:31:14,022 --> 01:31:17,864
Oh, a little bit of this
and a little bit of that.

584
01:31:18,240 --> 01:31:22,332
- A man of mystery?
- One might say that, yes.

585
01:31:22,583 --> 01:31:27,343
I would tell you more
but it would be safer for you if I did not.

586
01:31:28,554 --> 01:31:31,560
- Are you all right?
- Of course I am!

587
01:31:31,811 --> 01:31:33,857
Yes?

588
01:31:35,527 --> 01:31:38,826
Excuse me. For a moment I thought
I was in your apartment.

589
01:31:40,246 --> 01:31:42,919
- Hello?
- I am in your apartment...

590
01:31:43,169 --> 01:31:45,633
- It's for you.
- For me...?

591
01:31:51,897 --> 01:31:57,242
- There's no need to leave on my account.
- There's need to leave on my account.

592
01:32:00,749 --> 01:32:04,382
- Hello??
- Monsieur Gadbois?

593
01:32:04,633 --> 01:32:08,057
Yes, this is Monsieur Gadbois.
Who is that speaking?

594
01:32:08,934 --> 01:32:11,731
Don't you know? Can't you guess?

595
01:32:11,982 --> 01:32:13,736
I'll give you a clue.

596
01:32:13,986 --> 01:32:19,123
This is the man who hates you
and would like to see you dead and buried!

597
01:32:19,373 --> 01:32:23,257
Are you the head waiter at the little
bistro on the Rue des Beaux Arts?

598
01:32:23,507 --> 01:32:26,096
No, this is Chief Inspector Dreyfus!

599
01:32:26,347 --> 01:32:27,725
Idiot?!

600
01:32:28,810 --> 01:32:33,362
You understand that anyone
could ask for Monsieur Guy Gadbois

601
01:32:33,613 --> 01:32:37,747
and say that they were Chief Inspector
Dreyfus. What is your code-name?

602
01:32:37,997 --> 01:32:40,753
Code-name... Code-name?

603
01:32:42,006 --> 01:32:46,056
I've never had
a code-name, lunatic?!

604
01:32:46,307 --> 01:32:52,028
Only the real Inspector Dreyfus would know
that he did not have a code-name.

605
01:32:53,322 --> 01:32:56,204
Clouseau, why are you still in Switzerland?

606
01:32:58,876 --> 01:33:02,843
Because I'm attempting
to interrogate Lady Litton

607
01:33:03,094 --> 01:33:05,683
and trying to find out where her husband is.

608
01:33:05,933 --> 01:33:09,399
Her husband is in Lugash.
He's been there since Tuesday!

609
01:33:09,650 --> 01:33:12,907
Well, in that case I'll leave
on the next available plane.

610
01:33:14,786 --> 01:33:18,335
Yes, quite, quite, sir. I quite understand.

611
01:33:18,586 --> 01:33:23,764
I'm not arguing about that.
That would be my advice as well.

612
01:33:24,014 --> 01:33:30,403
But... Yes, I can understand your feelings
under the circumstances. Absolutely.

613
01:33:30,654 --> 01:33:32,658
Yes, that is quite right.

614
01:33:32,909 --> 01:33:35,873
But, sir, whatever your feelings are,

615
01:33:36,124 --> 01:33:41,636
you must not call me here at any hour
of night or day, even in an emergency!

616
01:33:42,889 --> 01:33:47,607
A little bit of this and a little bit of that
add up sometimes... Thank you.

617
01:33:48,484 --> 01:33:51,240
Did you say
you were leaving on the next plane?

618
01:33:51,491 --> 01:33:56,210
Regrettably, yes, yes.
One of life's little tragedies.

619
01:33:56,460 --> 01:33:58,506
So, until we meet again...

620
01:34:00,218 --> 01:34:04,436
I will say, "Here is looking at you, kid."

621
01:34:10,491 --> 01:34:12,746
Is anything the matter?

622
01:34:13,706 --> 01:34:16,754
Yes... Strange taste.

623
01:34:18,091 --> 01:34:22,183
- Well, au revoir.
- Au revoir.

624
01:34:35,128 --> 01:34:37,049
The concierge, please.

625
01:35:31,793 --> 01:35:33,798
Monsieur Gadbois' room.

626
01:37:05,957 --> 01:37:07,252
Yes?

627
01:37:07,502 --> 01:37:13,098
Clouseau, since you disregarded my orders
and remain in Switzerland...

628
01:37:13,348 --> 01:37:15,227
- But...
- Don't interrupt!

629
01:37:15,478 --> 01:37:16,898
Arrest Lady Litton.

630
01:37:17,148 --> 01:37:19,027
Arrest Lady Litton?

631
01:37:19,278 --> 01:37:20,990
Immediately!

632
01:37:21,240 --> 01:37:23,537
If she's not in your custody in five minutes,

633
01:37:23,788 --> 01:37:27,086
you'll be checking parking meters
in Martinique!

634
01:37:27,838 --> 01:37:29,216
Yes, sir.

635
01:37:32,181 --> 01:37:34,060
Five minutes!

636
01:37:37,609 --> 01:37:42,996
No, Cato, you fool. This is not the time.
This is not the time, Cato!

637
01:37:44,332 --> 01:37:46,629
Come out of there!

638
01:37:46,880 --> 01:37:48,926
This is the time.

639
01:37:50,930 --> 01:37:54,647
Stupid fool, you forgot
the first rule of self-defence.

640
01:37:54,897 --> 01:37:56,776
Never allow yourself to be taken by surprise!

641
01:37:57,027 --> 01:37:59,699
Anyway, I didn't expect to see you soon.

642
01:37:59,908 --> 01:38:02,414
My brown suit... Valet!

643
01:38:02,664 --> 01:38:05,880
They've done an excellent restoration
on your little yellow skin.

644
01:38:06,130 --> 01:38:10,348
Valet, this is Inspector Clouseau.
Please send up my...

645
01:38:10,598 --> 01:38:13,688
Well, please send down my brown suit
immediately.

646
01:38:13,939 --> 01:38:17,238
As quick as you can. Quicker, please!

647
01:38:18,240 --> 01:38:20,704
As if I can wait! Help me get dressed.

648
01:38:21,915 --> 01:38:25,714
Arrest Lady Litton? But on what charge?

649
01:38:27,134 --> 01:38:29,640
Hallo, this is Inspector Clouseau!

650
01:38:29,890 --> 01:38:32,897
Please connect me with Paris, France.

651
01:38:37,950 --> 01:38:40,664
Hello, oui? What?

652
01:38:40,914 --> 01:38:42,292
Who?

653
01:38:43,044 --> 01:38:46,134
Oh... Yes, yes, OK, I'll accept it.

654
01:38:48,932 --> 01:38:51,855
Hello, Clouseau. No, he is not here.

655
01:38:52,774 --> 01:38:54,486
He's on vacation.

656
01:38:54,736 --> 01:38:59,288
But I just spoke with him and he told me
to arrest Lady Litton immediately.

657
01:38:59,538 --> 01:39:01,543
What? Yes.

658
01:39:02,253 --> 01:39:04,382
That's very easy for you to say.

659
01:39:04,633 --> 01:39:07,681
I'd be delighted to, but on what charge?

660
01:39:07,932 --> 01:39:09,936
It could be embarrassing for me.

661
01:39:10,187 --> 01:39:14,905
She says, "On what charge?"
and I do not have the answer!

662
01:39:15,740 --> 01:39:18,204
What? Oh, yes?

663
01:39:18,455 --> 01:39:20,501
And the same to you!

664
01:39:21,419 --> 01:39:23,048
Filthy swine!

665
01:39:24,301 --> 01:39:26,681
Cato, very strange...

666
01:39:26,931 --> 01:39:32,945
Chief Inspector Dreyfus wants me
to arrest her immediately without a charge.

667
01:39:33,195 --> 01:39:36,035
I call back and find that he is not in his office.

668
01:39:36,285 --> 01:39:40,085
Even stranger, I find
he's gone away on vacation.

669
01:39:40,336 --> 01:39:43,802
Cato, things are very fishy in Denmark.

670
01:39:44,052 --> 01:39:45,472
Switzerland.

671
01:39:45,722 --> 01:39:47,435
Yes, there too.

672
01:39:56,078 --> 01:39:59,544
No more. No more! I've had enough!

673
01:39:59,795 --> 01:40:04,054
This time it ends
with a bullet in his brain. Brain?

674
01:40:45,311 --> 01:40:47,357
Bonjour, madame!

675
01:40:48,526 --> 01:40:50,990
Breakfast. Voila!

676
01:40:51,449 --> 01:40:54,623
Leave it over there. I'll sign for it later.

677
01:41:01,221 --> 01:41:03,810
How about a little tip?

678
01:41:05,563 --> 01:41:08,069
Charles! Darling!

679
01:41:10,366 --> 01:41:13,372
All right. Now, where is it?

680
01:41:13,623 --> 01:41:16,754
After all these years, you need to ask?

681
01:41:17,005 --> 01:41:20,053
- I'm quite serious.
- Oh, I hope so.

682
01:41:20,304 --> 01:41:22,893
You waiters lead such interesting lives.

683
01:41:23,143 --> 01:41:25,983
No, no, not now, please. Where is it?

684
01:41:27,820 --> 01:41:29,950
That depends on what you're looking for.

685
01:41:30,201 --> 01:41:33,082
Come on, Claudine, I'm losing patience!

686
01:41:34,167 --> 01:41:37,466
I shall ask the hotel
to send up another waiter.

687
01:41:38,510 --> 01:41:43,187
I should like very much if you would
hand me over the Pink Panther,

688
01:41:43,438 --> 01:41:45,651
if it is not too much trouble.

689
01:41:48,449 --> 01:41:50,829
How did you find out so quickly?

690
01:41:51,539 --> 01:41:53,251
Feminine intuition.

691
01:41:54,921 --> 01:41:57,886
I thought it would take you
at least another week.

692
01:41:59,055 --> 01:42:02,521
You are very good at what you do.

693
01:42:02,772 --> 01:42:04,567
Thank you.

694
01:42:04,818 --> 01:42:09,202
I was prepared to surrender
my body to Clouseau if necessary.

695
01:42:09,453 --> 01:42:11,541
Why did you do it?

696
01:42:12,585 --> 01:42:15,758
I didn't. I said I was prepared to.

697
01:42:16,677 --> 01:42:19,182
Aren't you a little bit proud of me?

698
01:42:19,433 --> 01:42:22,607
- You nearly had me killed.
- Better than dying of boredom.

699
01:42:22,857 --> 01:42:24,861
Me bored with you? Huh!

700
01:42:25,530 --> 01:42:27,283
I'm sorry, darling.

701
01:42:28,202 --> 01:42:30,374
 It's just that I never realised

702
01:42:30,624 --> 01:42:35,176
how tedious life could be
for a retired jewel thief.

703
01:42:35,426 --> 01:42:36,929
Yuck!

704
01:42:41,982 --> 01:42:43,987
Clever little beast.

705
01:42:45,031 --> 01:42:46,951
Better than a hotel safe.

706
01:42:52,088 --> 01:42:53,841
Now tell me...

707
01:42:54,760 --> 01:42:57,140
how did you find out it was me?

708
01:42:58,268 --> 01:43:03,070
Well, there's something about a wife...
even with a beard.

709
01:43:05,701 --> 01:43:11,756
Come on, darling, it's time to get dressed,
pack and go home.

710
01:43:12,257 --> 01:43:13,718
Darling...

711
01:43:15,848 --> 01:43:19,773
Forgive me, madame, but you see
before you a very disillusioned man.

712
01:43:20,024 --> 01:43:24,241
Disillusioned, and with a gun.
He's obviously not with the hotel.

713
01:43:24,492 --> 01:43:28,208
No. Allow me to introduce Colonel Sharki
of the Lugash Secret Police.

714
01:43:28,459 --> 01:43:30,630
Oh. That explains the gun.

715
01:43:30,881 --> 01:43:34,848
I foolishly believed
that your husband was a man of integrity.

716
01:43:35,098 --> 01:43:37,395
- That was foolish.
- Thank you (!)

717
01:43:37,645 --> 01:43:40,026
Your husband and I had an arrangement.

718
01:43:42,364 --> 01:43:45,120
He was to do certain things and if he didn't...

719
01:43:45,371 --> 01:43:48,294
You were to do...certain things.

720
01:43:48,544 --> 01:43:50,381
Regrettably.

721
01:43:51,133 --> 01:43:53,973
Coffee, darling? Sorry, there's only one cup.

722
01:43:55,309 --> 01:44:01,197
I know I'm going to be sorry I asked, but...
want to give me a for instance?

723
01:44:01,447 --> 01:44:03,828
First, you'll hand over the Pink Panther.

724
01:44:04,078 --> 01:44:05,790
And second?

725
01:44:06,041 --> 01:44:09,005
- I will be forced to shoot you.
- Who's forcing you?

726
01:44:13,307 --> 01:44:15,728
Open the door in the name of the law!

727
01:44:15,979 --> 01:44:19,487
Would you, please, sir, answer the door?

728
01:44:19,737 --> 01:44:21,783
Excuse me, darling.

729
01:44:22,034 --> 01:44:25,750
Lady Litton,
I am forced to arrest you?!

730
01:44:26,001 --> 01:44:28,381
If you do not open this door,

731
01:44:28,632 --> 01:44:31,095
I will have to break it down!

732
01:44:31,346 --> 01:44:33,183
Very well!

733
01:44:41,952 --> 01:44:44,166
You're all wet!

734
01:44:44,416 --> 01:44:46,462
A defect in my plumbing.

735
01:44:46,755 --> 01:44:48,968
Lady Litton, listen to me.

736
01:44:49,218 --> 01:44:51,933
I have deceived you.

737
01:44:52,183 --> 01:44:56,568
I am not Guy Gadbois.
I am Inspector Clouseau.

738
01:44:56,860 --> 01:44:59,365
It is my painful duty to arrest you.

739
01:44:59,616 --> 01:45:02,998
- Do you know my husband?
- I met him several years ago.

740
01:45:03,249 --> 01:45:05,587
When I meet him again,
I shall arrest him immediately!

741
01:45:05,838 --> 01:45:07,842
Then you must have met Colonel Sharki?

742
01:45:08,093 --> 01:45:12,477
That idiot from the Lugash Secret Police?
Yes, I know him. And when I...

743
01:45:13,772 --> 01:45:18,616
Sir Charles Litton, I arrest you in the name
of the law, and anything you say...

744
01:45:20,704 --> 01:45:23,877
Before you get all worked up,
there's something you must know.

745
01:45:24,128 --> 01:45:26,424
He intends to kill all of us.

746
01:45:26,675 --> 01:45:28,930
- Who?
- Colonel Sharki.

747
01:45:33,106 --> 01:45:37,240
Good Sharki, Colonel God!
We were just talking about you.

748
01:45:37,950 --> 01:45:41,666
As you can see, I've got
the whole case buttoned up.

749
01:45:41,917 --> 01:45:46,009
This is Sir Charles Phantom,
the famous Pink Litton who stole...

750
01:45:47,429 --> 01:45:51,604
- He's going to kill us?
- Unless you get him to change his mind.

751
01:45:52,648 --> 01:45:55,070
- You're joking, of course?
- No.

752
01:45:56,532 --> 01:45:59,831
- You're going to kill me as well??
- With pleasure.

753
01:46:01,292 --> 01:46:04,257
Is there anything I can do
to change your mind?

754
01:46:04,967 --> 01:46:08,767
Oh, well, there's nothing that I can think of.

755
01:46:09,017 --> 01:46:11,314
Supposing that I thought of something?

756
01:46:12,316 --> 01:46:14,279
For instance?

757
01:46:15,406 --> 01:46:16,868
Well...

758
01:46:18,580 --> 01:46:23,173
For instance, supposing I told you
that your fly was undone?

759
01:46:24,301 --> 01:46:27,725
By a remarkable coincidence, so is yours.

760
01:46:29,061 --> 01:46:31,024
Oh, not again!

761
01:46:32,694 --> 01:46:38,457
Ah, I see you are familiar
with the open fly ploy. So am I.

762
01:46:39,960 --> 01:46:44,929
You also know the falling on the bed
with the arm on the floor ploy. Interesting.

763
01:46:45,180 --> 01:46:47,769
- He's been shot dead, you idiot!
- Don't call me an idiot!

764
01:47:07,019 --> 01:47:08,856
Be careful, darling.

765
01:47:09,107 --> 01:47:12,155
He's either reloading or out of ammunition.

766
01:47:13,533 --> 01:47:16,206
He's out of his mind, that's what he's out of.

767
01:47:27,940 --> 01:47:30,236
I kill him! I kill him!

768
01:47:30,821 --> 01:47:33,034
- Monsieur!
- I kill you!

769
01:47:49,863 --> 01:47:56,001
Chief Inspector Dreyfus
was found not guilty by reason of insanity.

770
01:47:56,252 --> 01:48:00,636
Clouseau, the famous detective,
was decorated by General Wadafi.

771
01:48:00,887 --> 01:48:02,807
Then he went back to France,

772
01:48:03,058 --> 01:48:07,484
where he took over the position
vacated by the madman Dreyfus.

773
01:48:07,735 --> 01:48:12,871
There it is, ladies and gentlemen,
the largest diamond in the world.

774
01:48:13,122 --> 01:48:19,970
And surely the most famous, or infamous,
if you prefer - the Pink Panther.

775
01:48:20,221 --> 01:48:21,807
And Sir Charles?

776
01:48:22,851 --> 01:48:29,240
As far as anyone knows, he's
living the quiet life in the South of France.

777
01:48:29,491 --> 01:48:34,418
Although there has been a rumour
that the Phantom is back at work.

778
01:48:34,669 --> 01:48:37,049
Although it has long been suspected

779
01:48:37,341 --> 01:48:40,849
that Sir Charles and the Phantom
are one and the same,

780
01:48:41,099 --> 01:48:43,563
it has never been proved.

781
01:48:45,735 --> 01:48:47,447
Mark my words, François,

782
01:48:47,697 --> 01:48:52,374
I will definitely prove
that Sir Charles Litton is the Phantom.

783
01:48:53,585 --> 01:48:56,508
- Did you enjoy your food?
- Yes, sir, very nice.

784
01:48:56,759 --> 01:49:00,934
You probably guessed
that I have a passion for oriental food.

785
01:49:02,020 --> 01:49:06,906
Cato usually cooks for me, but recently
he's taken to attacking me at every chance.

786
01:49:07,156 --> 01:49:09,662
It's very bad for the digestion.

787
01:49:14,172 --> 01:49:16,301
That is very strange, François.

788
01:49:16,552 --> 01:49:21,563
I don't ever recall receiving
a fortune cookie in a Japanese restaurant.

789
01:49:21,813 --> 01:49:24,611
- What does it say?
- We shall see.

790
01:49:28,536 --> 01:49:34,591
"Beware of Japanese waitress
bearing fortune cookies."

791
01:49:35,844 --> 01:49:37,848
"Japanese waitress"?

792
01:49:45,072 --> 01:49:46,450
Cato!

793
01:49:49,499 --> 01:49:51,420
No, you idiot!

794
01:49:56,890 --> 01:49:59,354
Oh, I'm so terribly sorry, I...

795
01:50:10,002 --> 01:50:12,967
Cato, no more! Enough, enough!

796
01:50:13,802 --> 01:50:18,103
Enough, I tell you!
Take those little yellow hands off me!

797
01:50:18,395 --> 01:50:24,158
Remember my new position in the force.
You devastated my sukiyaki in there!

798
01:50:24,909 --> 01:50:27,582
You fool! Raving oriental idiot!

799
01:50:27,791 --> 01:50:30,213
There's a time and place for everything!

800
01:50:31,591 --> 01:50:33,553
And this is it.

801
01:51:20,489 --> 01:51:23,036
Kill him! Kill him!
