1
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,558
What the fuck is that?

2
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,355
Jimmy?

3
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,392
-What's up?
-Did I hit something?

4
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,072
What the fuck is that?

5
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,638
Maybe you got a flat?

6
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,355
No.

7
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,077
What the fuck?
You better pull over and see.

8
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,350
He's still alive. You fucking piece of shit!

9
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:48,159
Die, you motherfucker! Look at me!

10
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:01,028
<i>As far back as I can remember,
I always wanted to be a gangster.</i>

11
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,429
<i>To me...</i>

12
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:44,752
<i>being a gangster was better than
being president of the United States.</i>

13
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,236
<i>Even before I first wandered
into the cabstand for an after-school job...</i>

14
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,390
<i>I knew I wanted to be a part of them.</i>

15
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,869
<i>It was there that I knew I belonged.</i>

16
00:02:55,960 --> 00:03:00,351
<i>To me, it meant being somebody
in a neighborhood full of nobodies.</i>

17
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:03,432
<i>They weren't like anybody else.
They did whatever they wanted.</i>

18
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:07,069
<i>They double-parked in front of a hydrant,
nobody ever gave them a ticket.</i>

19
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,469
<i>In the summer,
when they played cards all night...</i>

20
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,596
<i>nobody ever called the cops.</i>

21
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,076
Tony Stacks. How are you?

22
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,799
<i>Tuddy Cicero.</i>

23
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,075
Could this be the Canarsie Kid?

24
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,159
-How are you?
-Good.

25
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,515
<i>Tuddy.</i>

26
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,398
<i>Tuddy ran the cabstand
and the Bella Vista Pizzeria...</i>

27
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,951
<i>and other places for his brother, Paul,
who was the boss of the neighborhood.</i>

28
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,555
<i>Paulie might have moved slow...</i>

29
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,754
<i>but it was only because Paulie
didn't have to move for anybody.</i>

30
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,832
-It's your fault.
-You started it.

31
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,911
I started it? It's your fault.

32
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,278
<i>At first my parents loved that I found
a job across the street from the house.</i>

33
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,955
<i>My father, who was Irish,
was sent to work at the age of 11.</i>

34
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,037
<i>He liked that I got myself a job.</i>

35
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,510
<i>He always used to say
that American kids were spoiled lazy.</i>

36
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,832
-Bye, Dad.
-Bye.

37
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,599
See you, Mikey.

38
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,908
Bye, Henry.

39
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,991
Henry! Watch how you cross!

40
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,513
Bring back milk!

41
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,672
<i>My mother was happy after
she found out that the Ciceros...</i>

42
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:35,230
<i>came from the same part of Sicily
as she did. To my mother...</i>

43
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,993
<i>that was the answer to all her prayers.</i>

44
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,829
<i>I was the luckiest kid in the world.</i>

45
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,718
<i>I could go anywhere, I could do anything.</i>

46
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,360
<i>I knew everybody,
and everybody knew me.</i>

47
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,513
<i>Wiseguys would pull up
and Tuddy would toss me their keys...</i>

48
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,352
<i>and let me park their Cadillacs.</i>

49
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:55,955
<i>Here I am, this little kid,
I can't even see over the steering wheel...</i>

50
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,156
<i>and I'm parking Cadillacs.</i>

51
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,276
<i>But it wasn't too long...</i>

52
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,114
<i>before my parents changed
their minds about my job at the cabstand.</i>

53
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,713
For your mother and sister.

54
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,236
<i>For them, the cabstand was supposed
to be a part-time job. But for me...</i>

55
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,311
<i>it was definitely full-time.</i>

56
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,311
<i>That's all I wanted to do.</i>

57
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,473
<i>People like my father could never
understand, but I was a part of something.</i>

58
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,279
<i>I belonged. I was treated like a grown-up.</i>

59
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,479
Tell him 519.

60
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,631
<i>Every day I was learning to score.</i>

61
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,154
<i>A dollar here, a dollar there.</i>

62
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,117
<i>I was living in a fantasy.</i>

63
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,073
Did you have a good day at school?

64
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,991
<i>My father was always pissed off.</i>

65
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,196
<i>Pissed that he made such lousy money...</i>

66
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,158
<i>pissed that my kid brother Michael
was in a wheelchair.</i>

67
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:47,313
<i>He was pissed that there were seven of us
living in such a tiny house.</i>

68
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,358
Tell me about this.

69
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,716
It's a letter from school.

70
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,913
It says you haven't been there in months.

71
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,394
In months!

72
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,519
You're a bum !

73
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,716
Want to grow up to be a bum?

74
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:08,239
<i>After a while, he was mostly pissed
because I hung around the cabstand.</i>

75
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,231
<i>He knew what went on at that cabstand.</i>

76
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:14,791
<i>Every once in a while, I'd have to take
a beating. But by then, I didn't care.</i>

77
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,718
<i>The way I saw it...</i>

78
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,600
<i>everybody takes a beating sometime.</i>

79
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,395
-I can't make any more deliveries.
-What? You'll fuck everything up.

80
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,516
My dad says he'll kill me. Look.

81
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,999
Come on with me.

82
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,071
-Is that him, kid?
-No.

83
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,392
-How about him?
-No.

84
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,231
-That's the guy.
-Get him.

85
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,274
Excuse me.

86
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,954
-Scumbag.
-Come here, you piece of shit.

87
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,516
-Know this kid?
-Yeah.

88
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,158
-Know where he lives?
-Yeah.

89
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,470
-You deliver mail to his house?
-Yeah.

90
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,235
From now on, any letter from that school
to his house comes directly here.

91
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,469
-Understand?
-Yeah.

92
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,233
Another letter from that school
goes to that kid's house...

93
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,788
in the fucking oven you'll go, head first.

94
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:11,078
<i>That was it. No more letters from
truant officers. No letters from school.</i>

95
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,196
<i>In fact, no more letters from anybody.</i>

96
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,829
<i>Finally after a few weeks, my mother
went to the post office to complain.</i>

97
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,918
<i>How could I go to school after that...</i>

98
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,993
<i>and pledge allegiance to the flag
and sit through good government bullshit?</i>

99
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:29,032
<i>Paulie hated phones.
He wouldn't have one in his house.</i>

100
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,714
Mickey called. Want me to call him back?

101
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,672
All right, make the call.

102
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:37,309
<i>He got all his calls second hand.
Then you'd have to call the people back...</i>

103
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,435
<i>from an outside phone.</i>

104
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,909
Got a nickel? Get him on the phone.

105
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:46,191
<i>There were guys, that's all they did
all day, was take care of Paulie's calls.</i>

106
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,638
<i>For a guy who moved all day long,
Paulie didn't talk to six people.</i>

107
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,678
<i>If there was a union problem
or, say, a beef in the numbers...</i>

108
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:06,150
<i>only the top guys could meet
with Paulie to discuss the problem.</i>

109
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,391
<i>Everything was one-on-one.
Paulie hated conferences.</i>

110
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,509
<i>He didn't want anybody
hearing what he said...</i>

111
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,876
<i>and he didn't want anybody listening
to what he was being told.</i>

112
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:20,078
<i>Hundreds of guys depended on Paulie,
he got a piece of everything they made.</i>

113
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,392
<i>It was a tribute, like in the old country,
except they were doing it in America.</i>

114
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:28,837
<i>All they got from Paulie was protection
from other guys looking to rip them off.</i>

115
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:32,708
<i>That's what it's all about. That's what
the FBI could never understand.</i>

116
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:35,276
<i>What Paulie and the Organization does...</i>

117
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,148
<i>is offer protection for people
who can't go to the cops. That's it.</i>

118
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:43,679
<i>That's all it is. They're like
the police department for wiseguys.</i>

119
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:57,039
<i>People looked at me differently,
and they knew I was with somebody.</i>

120
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:01,199
<i>I didn't have to wait in line at the bakery
on Sunday mornings for fresh bread.</i>

121
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,679
<i>The owner knew who I was with...</i>

122
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:06,275
<i>and he'd come from around the counter.
No matter how many were waiting...</i>

123
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,271
<i>I was taken care of first.</i>

124
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,829
<i>Our neighbors didn't park
in our driveway anymore...</i>

125
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,480
<i>even though we didn't have a car. At 13...</i>

126
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,393
<i>I was making more money than most
of the grown-ups around.</i>

127
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,517
<i>I had more money than I could spend.
I had it all.</i>

128
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:33,791
<i>One day, some neighborhood kids carried
my mother's groceries all the way home.</i>

129
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,233
<i>You know why?</i>

130
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,792
<i>It was out of respect.</i>

131
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,471
Hi, Mom, what do you think?

132
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,634
-Look at my shoes, aren't they great?
-My God.

133
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,718
You look like a gangster.

134
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,472
They shot me. Help!

135
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,632
Henry, shut the door.

136
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,751
<i>That was the first time
I had ever seen anyone shot.</i>

137
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,630
Can't have that in here. Jesus Christ!

138
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,631
I can't have that in this joint.

139
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,438
<i>I remember feeling bad about the guy...</i>

140
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,557
<i>but I also remember feeling
that maybe Tuddy was right.</i>

141
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,434
<i>I knew Paulie didn't want
anybody dying in the building.</i>

142
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:14,229
You're a real jerk. You wasted
eight fucking aprons on this guy.

143
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,471
What the hell's wrong with you?
I got to toughen this kid up.

144
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,157
<i>It was a glorious time.</i>

145
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,548
<i>And wiseguys were all over the place.</i>

146
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:45,352
<i>It was before Apalachin
and before Crazy Joe...</i>

147
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,238
<i>decided to take on a boss and start a war.</i>

148
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,916
<i>It was when I met the world.</i>

149
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,639
<i>And it was when I first met
Jimmy Conway.</i>

150
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,110
<i>He couldn't have been more than 28 or 29
at the time...</i>

151
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,111
<i>but he was already a legend.</i>

152
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:04,113
<i>He'd walk in the door and everybody
who worked the room just went wild.</i>

153
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,760
<i>He'd give the doorman $100
just for opening the door.</i>

154
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:10,674
<i>He'd give hundreds to the dealers
and the guys who ran the games.</i>

155
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,672
<i>The bartender got $100
just for keeping the ice cubes cold.</i>

156
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,718
The Irishman is here
to take all you guineas' money.

157
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,434
-Want a drink?
-Give me a 7 and 7.

158
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,517
-I'd like you to meet the kid Henry.
-How you doing?

159
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,479
-Thank you.
-Keep them coming.

160
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,518
<i>Jimmy was one of the most
feared guys in the city.</i>

161
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,238
<i>He was first locked up at 11...</i>

162
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,357
<i>and he was doing hits
for mob bosses when he was 16.</i>

163
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,159
<i>See, hits never bothered Jimmy.
It was business.</i>

164
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,630
<i>But what Jimmy really loved to do...</i>

165
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,711
<i>what he really loved to do was steal.</i>

166
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,995
<i>He actually enjoyed it.</i>

167
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:58,868
<i>Jimmy was the kind of guy who rooted
for the bad guys in the movies.</i>

168
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,232
Give me your wallet.

169
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:07,157
You might know who we are,
but we know who you are. Understand?

170
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,629
<i>He was one of
the city's biggest hijackers...</i>

171
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:13,235
<i>of booze, cigarettes, razor blades,
shrimp and lobsters.</i>

172
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:16,198
<i>Shrimp and lobsters were best.
They went really fast.</i>

173
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:20,068
<i>Almost all of them were gimmies.
They just gave it up, no problem.</i>

174
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,832
<i>They called him Jimmy the Gent.</i>

175
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,069
Help the lady.

176
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,196
<i>Drivers loved him.
They used to tip him off...</i>

177
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:28,795
<i>about the really good loads.
Of course, everybody got a piece.</i>

178
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,950
Thanks, I'll be back for the rest later.

179
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,519
Okay, see you later.

180
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,438
Henry, come here.

181
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,311
-Say hello to Tommy.
-How're you doing, Henry?

182
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,391
You're gonna be working together, okay?

183
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,152
Help him. Go ahead.

184
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,590
Jimmy, you got anything good?

185
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,753
<i>And when the cops assigned a whole
army to stop Jimmy, what did he do?</i>

186
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,909
How're you doing?

187
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,752
<i>He made them partners.</i>

188
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,398
I'd complain, but who'd listen?

189
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,319
-One Pall Mall.
-There you go.

190
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,516
-What do you need?
-Two Luckies.

191
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,477
-Here you go, Henry.
-Thanks a lot.

192
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,629
What do you need?

193
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:04,359
-One Pall Mall.
-One Pall Mall, here you go.

194
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,078
-What are you doing?
-It's all right.

195
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,277
-You have permission from your mother?
-How many cartons you need?

196
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,193
-Where'd you get the cigarettes?
-Get him out of here.

197
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,032
-It's okay.
-It's not okay.

198
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:17,271
-You don't understand.
-You don't understand. Store's closed.

199
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,717
-Henry got pinched.
-Where?

200
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,597
By the factory, selling cigarettes.

201
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,389
<i>Henry Hill. The People of
the State of New York vs. Henry Hill.</i>

202
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:32,359
Docket number 704162.

203
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,552
Yes, sir. That's me.

204
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,919
Just stand there. Now stay there.

205
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,718
Counselor, proceed.

206
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,313
Congratulations.

207
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,517
Here's your graduation present.

208
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,512
-What for? I got pinched.
-Everyone does, but you did it right.

209
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,670
You told them nothing,
and they got nothing.

210
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:03,832
-I thought you'd be mad.
-I'm not mad, I'm proud of you.

211
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:08,118
You took your first pinch like a man
and learned the two greatest things in life.

212
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,430
-What?
-Look at me.

213
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,196
Never rat on your friends...

214
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,550
and always keep your mouth shut.

215
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,879
Here he is.

216
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,157
You broke your cherry.

217
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,552
Congratulations!

218
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,957
<i>By the time I grew up,
there was $30 billion a year in cargo...</i>

219
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,792
<i>moving through Idlewild Airport...</i>

220
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,872
<i>and believe me,
we tried to steal every bit of it.</i>

221
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,714
<i>See, you gotta understand,
we grew up near the airport.</i>

222
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,358
<i>It belonged to Paulie.</i>

223
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,113
<i>We had friends and relatives
who worked all over the place.</i>

224
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,829
<i>They would tip us off about
what was coming in and moving out.</i>

225
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,993
<i>If any truckers or airlines gave us trouble...</i>

226
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:30,073
<i>Paulie had the union people scare them
with a strike. It was beautiful.</i>

227
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,869
<i>It was a bigger moneymaker than numbers
and Jimmy was in charge of it all.</i>

228
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,713
<i>Whenever we needed money,
we'd rob the airport.</i>

229
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,189
<i>To us, it was better than Citibank.</i>

230
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,155
You got a phone? Come on!

231
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,835
Two niggers just stole my truck.
Can you believe that shit?

232
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,232
<i>There was Jimmy...</i>

233
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,039
<i>and Tommy and me.</i>

234
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,951
<i>And there was Anthony Stabile.</i>

235
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,553
How're you doing?

236
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,193
<i>Frankie Carbone.</i>

237
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,158
<i>And then there was Mo Black's brother,
Fat Andy.</i>

238
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,111
<i>And his guys, Frankie the Wop.</i>

239
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,792
<i>Freddy No Nose.</i>

240
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,074
<i>And then there was Pete the Killer,
who was Sally Balls'brother.</i>

241
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,151
<i>Then you had Nickey Eyes...</i>

242
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,117
<i>and Mikey Franzese.</i>

243
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,633
That guy, I wanna see him.

244
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,269
<i>Jimmy Two Times, who got that nickname
because he said everything twice.</i>

245
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,874
I'm gonna go get the papers,
get the papers.

246
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:56,029
What is this? Coats?
Henry, I need suits, not coats.

247
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,999
Suits are coming Thursday.

248
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:00,958
But it's the middle of summer.
What'll I do with fur coats?

249
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,156
You don't want furs? I'll take them away.

250
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:07,518
No, I want them. We'll hang them
in the freezer with the meat. How's that?

251
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,160
<i>For us, to live any other way was nuts.</i>

252
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,474
<i>To us, those goody-good people who
worked shitty jobs for bum paychecks...</i>

253
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:18,473
<i>and took the subway to work every day
and worried about bills, were dead.</i>

254
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,268
<i>They were suckers. They had no balls.</i>

255
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,915
<i>If we wanted something, we just took it.</i>

256
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,357
<i>If anyone complained twice, they got hit
so bad they never complained again.</i>

257
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:31,830
<i>It was just all routine.
You didn't even think about it.</i>

258
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,278
Frankie, what the fuck does 520
have to do with 469?

259
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,759
I can't believe this guy.

260
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:42,674
520 ain't even close to 469.
What's that got to do with anything?

261
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,513
Piece of cake. It's all there.

262
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,831
Don't worry about the alarms.
I just gotta find a way to get the key.

263
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,354
-No problem, right?
-I'll take care of it.

264
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,836
-Tell him what you were telling me.
-Too good to be true.

265
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:08,315
Big score coming from Air France.
Bags of money coming in.

266
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,874
Tourists and American servicemen
change their money...

267
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,916
into French money and send it back here.

268
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,991
-Calm down.
-It's beautiful.

269
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,552
It's totally untraceable. Okay?

270
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,279
The only problem is getting a key,
but I've got a plan.

271
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:25,670
-Me and Frenchy and this citizen.
-Yeah, he's a piece of work.

272
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,469
If I'm right, there could be
$500,000 coming in, all cash.

273
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:34,149
The best time is probably over a weekend.
So maybe Saturday night.

274
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,231
There's a Jewish holiday on Monday.

275
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,629
They won't find out until Tuesday.
Beautiful.

276
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,551
What about the security?

277
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,834
Security?

278
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,152
You're looking at it. It's a joke.
I'm the midnight-to-eight man.

279
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,719
I'm the commandant.

280
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,598
He just comes in
like he's picking up lost baggage.

281
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,148
-It's beautiful.
-It won't be a problem at all.

282
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,673
-Good.
-We're on.

283
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,270
What's really funny is
that fucking bank job in Secaucus.

284
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,316
I'm in the middle of the weeds,
lying down.

285
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,755
He says, "What are you doing?"
I said, "I'm resting."

286
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:06,071
"Here? This ain't no beach or park."
I said, "I'm resting."

287
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,593
I know I'm resting.

288
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,911
He pulls me in, starts asking questions.
You know, this and that.

289
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,912
"What are you going to tell us?"
I said, "My usual. Nothing.

290
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,198
"Why tell you?" The fuck. He says,
"No, you'll tell me something today."

291
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,710
I said, "Okay, go fuck your mother."

292
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,996
You saw the paper, Anthony.
My head was out like this.

293
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:32,076
Now I'm coming around,
and who do I see in front of me?

294
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,755
This prick again. He says,
"What do you want to tell me now?"

295
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,674
I said, "What are you doing here?
I told you to go fuck your mother."

296
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,670
I thought he was gonna shit.

297
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,599
The fuckers. I wish I was big just once.

298
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,671
Funny. You're really funny.

299
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,796
What do you mean, I'm funny?

300
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,031
It's funny, you know. It's a good story.

301
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,758
You're a funny guy.

302
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,870
You mean the way I talk? What?

303
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,274
It's just, you know. You're just funny.

304
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,629
You know, the way
you tell the story and everything.

305
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,995
Funny how? What's funny about it?

306
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,314
-Tommy, you got it all wrong.
-Anthony.

307
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,960
He's a big boy. He knows what he said.
What did you say?

308
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,268
Funny, how?

309
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,796
Just, you know. You're funny.

310
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,037
Let me understand this.

311
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,236
Maybe I'm a little fucked up.

312
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,551
But, I'm funny, how? Funny like a clown?
I amuse you?

313
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,794
I make you laugh?
I'm here to fucking amuse you?

314
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,474
What do you mean, funny?
How am I funny?

315
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,995
You know, how you tell a story.

316
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:48,835
No, I don't know. You said it.
How do I know? You said I'm funny.

317
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:52,316
How the fuck am I funny?
What the fuck is so funny about me?

318
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,158
Tell me what's funny.

319
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,431
Get the fuck out of here, Tommy.

320
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,557
Motherfucker! I almost had him !

321
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,596
You stuttering prick, you!

322
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,557
Frankie, was he shaking?

323
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:14,235
I wonder about you sometimes, Henry.
You may fold under questioning.

324
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,715
Jesus Christ.

325
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:23,349
What the fuck is it with you?
I thought I was getting pinched already.

326
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,716
He's hanging on my fucking neck
like a vulture. What do you want?

327
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,917
This guy didn't want to come
and give you the check.

328
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,998
Could you take care of this?

329
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,878
No problem. Tell him to put it
on my tab. Of course.

330
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,837
That's what I want to talk to you about.

331
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:40,230
It ain't just this one.
It's seven big ones you owe me.

332
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,110
$7,000, that ain't peanuts.
I don't mean to be out of order--

333
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,236
Don't mean to be out of order?

334
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,390
It's good you don't mean
to be out of order.

335
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,029
Embarrassing me in front of my friends,
like I'm a deadbeat.

336
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,072
You know, Sonny, you're a fucking mutt.

337
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,116
You know the money
we spend in this fucking--

338
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,475
-Don't be like that.
-What do you mean?

339
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:07,911
Do you believe this prick?
You think this is funny?

340
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,313
What the fuck are you looking at?
You fucking moron!

341
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,955
You don't want to bring the check?

342
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,476
Do you believe this prick?

343
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,873
You're supposed
to be doing this stuff, too.

344
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,598
You're a funny guy.

345
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,516
-That's it, Henry.
-No, go back.

346
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:36,114
You want to laugh? This prick last week
asked me to christen his kid.

347
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,870
I charged him $7,000.

348
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,751
You really are a funny guy.

349
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,511
I'm worried. I'm hearing all kinds
of fucking bad things.

350
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,551
He's treating me like I'm a fucking fag.

351
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,110
I got to go on the lam
in order to get away from this guy.

352
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:59,158
This ain't right. I can't go here,
I can't go there.

353
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:02,516
You think you're the only one?
I talk to them, they don't listen.

354
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:06,434
If you tell him, he'll stop.
I'll wind up being declared an MIA.

355
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:09,432
They'll find me in the back of a car
somewhere in the weeds.

356
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,080
You've known this Tommy all your life.
Who knows better?

357
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,673
This cocksucker's an arch criminal.

358
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:17,309
When I leave my house, before I get
to the car I look over both shoulders.

359
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,755
This is no way to live. I'm no fence jumper.

360
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,195
I'm around you all my life,
tell me what I gotta do.

361
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:25,033
-Whatever I got to do, I'm gonna do.
-What could I do?

362
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:29,079
If there was something I could do, I would.
I would like to help you out.

363
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,789
Sonny, tell him what we talked about.

364
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,076
-You think it's all right?
-Yeah.

365
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,269
Maybe you could come in with me,
take a piece of this joint. It'd be good.

366
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:43,272
What are you talking about?
You mean the restaurant?

367
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,079
It's a classy place. Look at the layout.

368
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:49,152
You've been in there a million times.
You know how it looks.

369
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:52,915
Tommy taking over this joint
is like putting a silk hat on a pig.

370
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,958
I don't mean no disrespect,
but that's the way it is.

371
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:59,316
I know you're his friend.
I'm begging you. What can I say?

372
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,833
What am I gonna do?
What do you want from me?

373
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:06,550
I don't know anything
about the restaurant business. Nothing.

374
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,110
All I know is to sit down and order a meal,
not how to make a restaurant.

375
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,430
Not for you. It's just a place to hang.

376
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:16,035
The chef is great. The shows are good.
There's a lot of whores coming in.

377
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:19,157
I'd love to help you, but what do you want
from me? What'll I do?

378
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:22,437
Tommy's a bad kid, a bad seed.
What am I supposed to do? Shoot him?

379
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,431
That wouldn't be a bad idea.

380
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:33,438
I'm sorry I said that. I didn't mean it.
I just mean that he's scaring me.

381
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,989
I just need help. Help me, please.

382
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,155
You know anything about
this restaurant business?

383
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:42,038
He knows everything.
He's there 24 hours a day.

384
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,759
Another fucking few minutes,
he could be a stool.

385
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,398
That's how often he's in there.

386
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:50,155
You want me to be your partner?
Is that what you're telling me?

387
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,630
What the fuck you think I'm talking about?
Paulie, please. Come on.

388
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,631
It's not even fair.

389
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,399
You don't understand.

390
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:00,870
You run the joint.
Maybe I'll try to help you, all right.

391
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,953
God bless you, Paulie. I appreciate it.
You've always been fair with me.

392
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:08,828
<i>Now the guy's got Paulie as a partner.
Any problems, he goes to Paulie.</i>

393
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,990
<i>Trouble with a bill, he can go to Paulie.</i>

394
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,230
<i>Trouble with the cops,
deliveries, Tommy...</i>

395
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,548
<i>he can call Paulie.</i>

396
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,473
<i>Now the guy's gotta come up
with Paulie's money every week...</i>

397
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,675
<i>no matter what.</i>

398
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:22,719
<i>"Business is bad? Fuck you, pay me.
Had a fire? Fuck you, pay me.</i>

399
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:25,553
<i>"The place got hit by lightning?
Fuck you, pay me. "</i>

400
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,790
Can I get one of those TVs?

401
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,552
<i>Also, Paulie could do anything.</i>

402
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:32,632
<i>Especially run up bills on the joint's credit.
And why not?</i>

403
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,676
<i>Nobody's gonna pay for it anyway.</i>

404
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,751
<i>When deliveries are made
at the front door...</i>

405
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:39,479
<i>you move the stuff out the back
and sell it at a discount.</i>

406
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:42,711
<i>You take a $200 case of booze
and sell it for $100.</i>

407
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,349
<i>It doesn't matter. It's all profit.</i>

408
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,554
<i>Then finally, when there's nothing left...</i>

409
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,675
Fucking shame.

410
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:54,799
<i>...when you can't borrow another buck
or buy another case of booze...</i>

411
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,553
<i>you bust the joint out. You light a match.</i>

412
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,153
Do you need help reaching anything?

413
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,549
You look like
you're decorating a Christmas tree.

414
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,790
You don't know what you're doing.

415
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,356
She's from the Five Towns.

416
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,075
Who?

417
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,837
The Jew broad, Diane,
I was telling you I'm going to shag.

418
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,880
I've been trying to bang her
for a fucking month now.

419
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,155
She won't go out with me alone.

420
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,233
-No.
-No, what?

421
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,430
No, what? Who the fuck
asked you anything?

422
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,476
I didn't ask you.
Hear what I'm going to say.

423
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,073
All right, what?

424
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,715
Okay, what.

425
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:32,480
She don't want to go out
with Italians alone.

426
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,755
She's prejudiced against Italians.

427
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:37,229
You fucking believe that?
In this day and age?

428
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,788
What the fuck is this world coming to?

429
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:44,435
I can't believe this. A Jew broad,
prejudiced against Italians.

430
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,671
She won't go out with me alone
unless her girlfriend comes with us.

431
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,796
So you come along,
go out with her girlfriend.

432
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,711
See? I knew it.

433
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:54,109
You knew what?
What the fuck is wrong with that?

434
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,191
-When is this?
-Tomorrow night.

435
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,838
I can't, I gotta meet Tuddy.

436
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,593
You could meet Tuddy.
You can come early and then still go.

437
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:03,035
-Why do you always do this?
-Don't give me that shit.

438
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,554
What did I ask you for?
I'm asking you for a favor.

439
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,437
I do a lot of fucking favors for you.

440
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,398
I'm trying to bang this fucking broad.
Help me out.

441
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,389
I don't understand you. She's beautiful!

442
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:17,517
Her fucking family lives in the Five Towns.
These Jews got money.

443
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,798
Maybe the family owns the whole block.
You may wind up with a big score.

444
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,876
You with your fucking mouth.

445
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:33,358
<i>I had a meeting with Tuddy at 11.:00,
and here I am, a backup guy for Tommy.</i>

446
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:36,029
How about it?
Did you have enough to eat?

447
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,634
It was delicious. I'm just watching my diet.

448
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,073
Let me watch your figure.

449
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,718
<i>I couldn't wait to get away.</i>

450
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:44,314
<i>I was ordering the dessert
when they were eating dinner.</i>

451
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,868
<i>When they were having coffee,
I was asking for a check.</i>

452
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,154
<i>I had business.</i>

453
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,674
Have some coffee. It'll wake you up.

454
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,836
-Can we have the check?
-What are you doing?

455
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:57,036
-I got to go.
-We just got here.

456
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,031
I got that thing. I gotta go.

457
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,310
Wait a couple of minutes.
We'll leave together.

458
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:05,075
This way we don't go out
like a bunch of hobos, one at a time.

459
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,358
<i>I couldn't stand him.</i>

460
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,835
<i>I thought he was really obnoxious.</i>

461
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,876
<i>He kept fidgeting around.</i>

462
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:15,638
You don't mind, do you?
That's very annoying.

463
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:22,153
Good? You might prefer Manischewitz,
but it'd look funny on my table.

464
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,359
-Ready?
-Henry, lighten up.

465
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,590
We just got here. What are you doing?

466
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:32,870
<i>Before it was time to go home,
he was pushing me into the car...</i>

467
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,157
<i>then pulling me out. It was ridiculous.</i>

468
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,996
<i>Diane and Tommy made us promise...</i>

469
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,991
<i>to meet them again on Friday night.</i>

470
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,229
<i>We agreed.</i>

471
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,915
<i>Of course, when Friday night came around,
Henry stood me up.</i>

472
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,719
I feel terrible. I don't know where he is.

473
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:52,158
He really liked you, too.
All he did was talk about her.

474
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,674
<i>We were a trio
instead of a double date that night.</i>

475
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:57,558
He would have called.
I hope it's nothing serious.

476
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:00,279
<i>But I made Tommy take me
looking for him.</i>

477
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,192
Tommy, what the fuck?

478
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:09,033
You got some nerve standing me up.

479
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,519
Nobody does that to me.

480
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:14,149
Who do you think you are,
Frankie Valli or some kind of big shot?

481
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:18,072
Slow down, I forgot.
I thought it was next week.

482
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:21,311
It was this Friday and you agreed,
so you're a liar!

483
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,197
We can talk about this. Take it easy.

484
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,713
Talk about it?

485
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,758
Talk to you after what
you just did to me? Forget it.

486
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:32,869
I thought you would stand me up.
You looked bored. You didn't say anything.

487
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,393
What do you expect?

488
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,031
Let me make it up to you.

489
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,474
I'll think about it.

490
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:43,030
<i>I remember, she was screaming
on the street, and I mean loud.</i>

491
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,394
<i>But she looked good.</i>

492
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,631
I'll think about it.
But it'll cost you, Hill. A lot.

493
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:50,314
<i>She had these great eyes
just like Liz Taylor's.</i>

494
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,391
<i>At least that's what I thought.</i>

495
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,835
Hello, Henry.

496
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,273
-You're ready?
-Yeah.

497
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,395
Come on.

498
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,152
-No, wait a minute.
-What?

499
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:02,153
Quick, you have to cover that cross.
My mother sees that--

500
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,434
Karen.

501
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:04,995
Mom.

502
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,953
-I'd like you to meet my friend, Henry Hill.
-How do you do?

503
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:11,396
-Nice to meet you.
-My daughter says that you're half Jewish.

504
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,157
It's just the good half.

505
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,951
-Thank you, sir.
-Bye, see you later, thanks.

506
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:19,270
What're you doing?
You're leaving your car?

507
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,032
He watches the car for me.

508
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,839
It's easier than leaving it at a garage
and waiting.

509
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:26,718
It's a lot quicker that way,
you know what I mean?

510
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,749
I like going in this way.
It's better than waiting in line.

511
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:44,476
How are you doing? What's up?
Here you go.

512
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,476
-How are you doing?
-I'm doing all right.

513
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,709
Good.

514
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,391
Every time I come here,
every time, you two. Don't you work?

515
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:52,392
Henry, nice to see you. Hi, how are you?

516
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,516
Anthony, right in the front.

517
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,795
Anything you need, just let me know.

518
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,960
Tony, thanks a lot. I appreciate it.

519
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:19,270
-How are you guys doing?
-How are you?

520
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,154
-You gave them $20 each.
-It's all right.

521
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,629
Henry, this is with Mr. Tony, over there.

522
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,039
-Where?
-Over there.

523
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,031
Thanks a lot, Tony.

524
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,470
-What do you do?
-What?

525
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:41,028
-What do you do?
-I'm in construction.

526
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,229
They don't feel like you're in construction.

527
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:47,038
I'm a union delegate.

528
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,913
<i>Now, ladies and gentlemen...</i>

529
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,471
<i>the Copacabana is proud to present
the king of one-liners...</i>

530
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,437
<i>Henny Youngman.</i>

531
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:05,949
How are you all? I'm glad to be here.
Take my wife, please.

532
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,235
I take my wife everywhere
but she finds her way home.

533
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:15,109
<i>I said, "Where do you wanna go
for our anniversary?"</i>

534
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,156
<i>She said,
"Somewhere I've never been before. "</i>

535
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,435
<i>I said, "Try the kitchen. "</i>

536
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,629
<i>Dr. Wellsler is here.</i>

537
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:24,712
<i>Gave a guy six months to live.
Couldn't pay his bill.</i>

538
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,791
<i>Gave him another six months.</i>

539
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,517
<i>I love this crowd.</i>

540
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,271
<i>Air France made me.</i>

541
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:50,035
<i>We walked out with $420,000
without using a gun.</i>

542
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:53,556
<i>And we did the right thing.
We gave Paulie his tribute.</i>

543
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,592
$60,000.

544
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,750
It's going to be a good summer.

545
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:08,269
I'm proud of you.
That is a lot of money for a kid like you.

546
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:12,239
Anybody asks you where you got it,
you got it in Vegas playing craps, all right?

547
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,639
All right.

548
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,553
Check, sir.

549
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:21,273
No. You have to sign for it here.

550
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,478
Should I tip him?

551
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,675
-How are you doing?
-Okay. How are you?

552
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:38,673
Henry, this is Bruce. Bruce, this is Henry.

553
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,271
Good to meet you.

554
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:44,116
I'll see you around later.

555
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:50,517
-Do you know him?
-Yeah.

556
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,352
He lives across the street.

557
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:21,037
<i>One night, Bobby Vinton sent us
champagne. There was nothing like it.</i>

558
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:25,029
<i>I didn't think there was
anything strange in any of this.</i>

559
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:27,953
<i>A 21-year-old kid with such connections.</i>

560
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,991
<i>He was an exciting guy.</i>

561
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:36,434
<i>He was really nice.
He introduced me to everybody.</i>

562
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,429
<i>Everybody wanted to be nice to him.</i>

563
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:42,071
<i>He knew how to handle it.</i>

564
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,955
<i>Don't buy wigs that come off
at the wrong time.</i>

565
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:54,634
<i>Morrie's wigs don't come off!</i>

566
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:55,948
<i>Even underwater.</i>

567
00:35:56,040 --> 00:36:00,272
<i>And remember, Morrie's wigs
are tested against hurricane winds.</i>

568
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:03,989
<i>Forget about money. You can afford
a Morrie wig. Priced to fit every budget.</i>

569
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,399
<i>Call me now!</i>

570
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,553
<i>Come in for a personalized fitting.</i>

571
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,678
Come on, Morrie. Jimmy's waiting.
You're past due.

572
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,194
You're a good kid.
We've been good to each other.

573
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,714
But there's something
unreasonable going on here.

574
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,995
Jimmy's being a ball-breaker.

575
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,036
Give him 8-to-5 on Cleveland.

576
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:28,590
I never had to pay the vigorish
he demands. Am I something special?

577
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,352
What am I, a schmuck on wheels?

578
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,874
You know Jimmy.
You borrowed his money. Pay him.

579
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,110
I didn't agree to three points
above the vig.

580
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,668
What are you going to do?
Fight with Jimmy Conway?

581
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,069
He wants his money.
Give him his money and we'll go.

582
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,195
Fuck him !

583
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:44,556
Fuck him in the ear!
Fuck him in the other ear!

584
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,358
Did I ever bust his balls? Did I?

585
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:49,079
I could've dropped a dime a million times.

586
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:52,277
You're talking crazy. Stop it now, will you?

587
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:55,511
You got money
for that fucking commercial.

588
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,955
You don't got my money?

589
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,917
Jimmy, he's gonna pay you.

590
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,390
I'll fucking kill you.
Give me the money, cocksucker.

591
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,072
Pay me my money.

592
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,718
He'll pay.

593
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:10,432
Morrie's. Who's this? He's here.

594
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,396
-Jimmy, I'm sorry.
-You should be sorry.

595
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:16,631
Don't do it again.
Give me the fucking money!

596
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,632
You hear me? Give me the fucking money.

597
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:23,269
I'll give you. You've got it, kid.
You've got it, believe me.

598
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:25,430
Karen, slow down.

599
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,630
Where? Stay there. Don't move.

600
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:31,790
-What happened?
-It's Karen, Jimmy.

601
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:34,235
-Money today.
-I'll pay.

602
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,830
What happened?

603
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,198
-Are you all right?
-Yeah.

604
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,713
Who did it?

605
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:54,032
This guy who lives across the street
from me that I've known all my life.

606
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,798
He started to touch me.
He started to grab me.

607
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,560
I told him to stop. He didn't stop.

608
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:08,349
I hit him back.
And then he got really angry.

609
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,516
He pushed me out of the car.

610
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,876
You sure you're all right?

611
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:28,349
Why don't you go inside
and get yourself together. Clean up.

612
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,914
What do you want, fucko?
You want something?

613
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:01,193
I swear on my fucking mother,
if you touch her again, you're dead.

614
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,194
Don't shoot.

615
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:26,388
-Hide this. Are you all right?
-Yeah.

616
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:33,158
<i>I know there are women,
like my best friends...</i>

617
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,834
<i>who would have gotten out
the minute their boyfriend...</i>

618
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,718
<i>gave them a gun to hide. But I didn't.</i>

619
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:42,398
<i>I've got to admit the truth.
It turned me on.</i>

620
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:49,834
<i>Mazel tov!</i>

621
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:24,828
Why don't you be like your friend Henry?
He's got a nice girl.

622
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:28,032
He's settling down now. He's married.

623
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:30,429
Pretty soon he'll have a nice family.

624
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:33,956
And you're still bouncing around
from girl to girl.

625
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,790
<i>It was like he had two families.</i>

626
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,039
<i>The first time I was introduced
to all of them at once, it was crazy.</i>

627
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:51,511
<i>Paulie and his brothers had lots
of sons and nephews.</i>

628
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:54,678
<i>Almost all of them
were named Peter or Paul.</i>

629
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,593
<i>It was unbelievable.</i>

630
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:00,911
Meet Paulie Jr., my nephew.
And this is Petey.

631
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:04,158
<i>There must have been two dozen
Peters and Pauls at the wedding.</i>

632
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,355
This is Marie.

633
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:08,193
<i>Plus, they were all married
to girls named Marie.</i>

634
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:11,239
-She looks Italian.
-She is Italian, you're right.

635
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:13,959
<i>And they named all their daughters Marie.</i>

636
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:18,389
And this is Pete. No, I mean Paulie.
I get confused myself.

637
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:22,429
<i>By the time I finished meeting everybody,
I thought I was drunk.</i>

638
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,832
Paulie, you shouldn't have.

639
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,398
Welcome to the family.

640
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:34,915
Sunday dinner?

641
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,560
So beautiful. I want to cry.

642
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:40,838
Here's something to help you get started.

643
00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:00,390
-The bag. The bag.
-What? What bag?

644
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:03,278
The bag with the envelopes in it,
all the money.

645
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:07,437
Don't worry about that.
Nobody's going to steal that here.

646
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:38,113
He didn't call?

647
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:42,115
-He's with his friends.
-What kind of person doesn't call?

648
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:45,317
He's a grown-up. He doesn't have to call
every five minutes.

649
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:48,836
If he was such a grown-up
why doesn't he get you two an apartment?

650
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:52,196
Don't start. Mom, you're the one
who wanted us here.

651
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:55,790
You're here a month and sometimes
I know he doesn't come home at all.

652
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:57,711
What kind of people are these?

653
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:00,598
-What do you want me to do?
-Do? What can you do?

654
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:03,433
He's not Jewish.
Did you know how these people live?

655
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,158
Did you know what they were like?

656
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:08,198
Your father never stayed out all night
without calling.

657
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:11,670
Stay out? Daddy never
went out at all, Ma ! Keep out of it.

658
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,591
You don't know how I feel!

659
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:17,468
How do you feel now? You don't know
where he is or who he's with.

660
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:20,028
He's with his friends! Dad!

661
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:22,076
Leave him out of this.
He's suffered enough.

662
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:24,993
He hasn't digested a decent meal
in six weeks.

663
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:37,390
Where were you? Why didn't you call?

664
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:41,951
We were worried to death.
A married man does not stay out like this.

665
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:46,440
Normal people don't act like this!

666
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:49,512
What's wrong with you?

667
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:53,669
You're not normal. She's right.
What's wrong with you?

668
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:56,911
What kind of person are you?
What is the matter with you?

669
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:59,516
What kind of people are they?

670
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:04,714
<i>We weren't married to nine-to-five guys.</i>

671
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,553
<i>But the first time I realized how different...</i>

672
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:09,915
<i>was when Mickey had a hostess party.</i>

673
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:13,160
-Karen, where you from?
-Lawrence.

674
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:17,358
On the Island. It's nice.
I'm from Miami. You ever been there?

675
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:21,076
It's okay, but it's like you died
and woke up in Jew heaven.

676
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:23,875
Angie, stop picking at that thing.

677
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,319
I'd like to smack his face.

678
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:27,152
The red-haired guy, looks like a farmer?

679
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:29,196
The guy's hands are all over me.

680
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:33,478
So I told him, "Keep your fucking hands
off me, or I'll cut them off."

681
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,439
She means it.

682
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:40,035
You don't know how lucky he is.
I just mention this to Vinnie....

683
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:43,272
How can you mention it?
Vinnie would kill him.

684
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:47,148
If I don't, he'll kill the miserable bastard,
then Vinnie will be there for life.

685
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:49,834
You think you got problems.
What about Jeannie's kid?

686
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:53,595
He was in an argument. A $10 card game.
He pulls out a gun.

687
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:57,229
The gun goes off. Some kid gets killed.
When the grandmother hears it...

688
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:01,313
and finds out he's jailed, she has a heart
attack and drops dead right on the spot.

689
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:05,632
Now Jeannie has a husband and son
in jail and a mother in the funeral parlor.

690
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:09,159
-Jeannie drinks.
-Maybe she's depressed.

691
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:11,356
Give me a break. She's drunk.

692
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:16,036
As soon as something happens,
you make them out to be saints.

693
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:20,830
<i>They had bad skin and wore too much
makeup. They didn't look very good.</i>

694
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:23,754
<i>They looked beat-up.
And the stuff they wore...</i>

695
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:25,717
<i>was thrown together and cheap.</i>

696
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:28,360
<i>A lot of pantsuits and double-knits.</i>

697
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:31,918
She spends her life in a nightgown.

698
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,275
The woman is no angel, believe me.

699
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:36,828
<i>They talked about their rotten kids...</i>

700
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:39,480
<i>and about beating them
with broom handles and belts.</i>

701
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:42,438
<i>And that the kids
still didn't pay any attention.</i>

702
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:44,431
<i>When Henry picked me up, I was dizzy.</i>

703
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:47,080
I don't know if I could live like that.

704
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:51,596
God forbid, what would happen
if you had to go to prison?

705
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:53,074
Karen.

706
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:55,711
Mickey said that Jeannie's husband--

707
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:58,030
Do you know why Jeannie's husband
went to the can?

708
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:01,430
Because of Jeannie.
He wanted to get away from her.

709
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:06,071
Let me tell you something.
Nobody goes to jail unless they want to.

710
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,311
Unless they make themselves get caught.

711
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,152
They don't have things organized.

712
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:13,471
I know what I'm doing.
I've got things organized with these guys.

713
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:17,838
You know who goes to jail? Nigger
stickup men. Know why they get caught?

714
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:20,798
Because they fall asleep
in the getaway car, Karen.

715
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:24,590
Come on, don't worry so much, sweetie.
Come here.

716
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:33,514
<i>After a while, it got to be all normal.</i>

717
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:36,635
<i>None of it seemed like crime.</i>

718
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:38,995
<i>It was more like Henry was enterprising...</i>

719
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:42,709
<i>and that he and the guys made bucks
hustling while other guys...</i>

720
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,678
<i>were sitting on their asses
waiting for handouts.</i>

721
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:50,319
<i>Our husbands weren't brain surgeons,
they were blue-collar guys.</i>

722
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:54,791
<i>The only way they could make real extra
money was to go out and cut corners.</i>

723
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,714
Where's the strong box, you varmint?

724
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:06,115
Don't fucking move! Don't move.

725
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:17,799
-See you at the diner.
-I'm riding shotgun.

726
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:20,519
Did you see him give it right over?

727
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:23,194
Back to the hideout to split up the loot.

728
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:29,235
<i>We were all so very close.</i>

729
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:33,029
<i>There were never any outsiders around.
Absolutely never.</i>

730
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:37,751
<i>Being together all the time made
everything seem all the more normal.</i>

731
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:39,193
Hello, Mrs. Hill. Police.

732
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:43,478
I'm Detective Deacy. This is Detective
Silvestri. We have a search warrant.

733
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:45,551
Would you read and sign it?

734
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:47,193
-Anywhere?
-Yeah, anywhere.

735
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,794
This'll take a while,
we have to go through everything.

736
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:52,838
-You boys want some coffee?
-No coffee now, thanks.

737
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:56,912
-Be careful.
-We'll just go about our business.

738
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,355
<i>There was always a little harassment.</i>

739
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:02,193
<i>They wanted to talk to Henry
about this or that.</i>

740
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:05,477
<i>They'd make me sign
their subpoenas or warrants.</i>

741
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:07,869
<i>But mostly they just wanted a handout.</i>

742
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:11,236
<i>A few bucks to keep things quiet
no matter what they found.</i>

743
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:20,990
<i>I always asked if they wanted coffee.
Some wives, like Mickey Conway...</i>

744
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:23,998
<i>used to curse at them
and spit on the floor.</i>

745
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:27,595
<i>She used to spit on her own floor.
That never made any sense to me.</i>

746
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:30,592
<i>It was better to be polite
and call the lawyer.</i>

747
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:43,717
<i>We always did everything together,
and we always were in the same crowd.</i>

748
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:47,634
<i>Anniversaries, christenings.
We only went to each other's houses.</i>

749
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,033
<i>The women played cards.</i>

750
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:55,079
<i>When kids were born, Mickey and Jimmy
were the first at the hospital.</i>

751
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:58,197
<i>When we went to the Islands
or Vegas for vacation...</i>

752
00:48:58,280 --> 00:48:59,554
<i>we went together.</i>

753
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:02,598
<i>No outsiders ever. It got to be normal.</i>

754
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:05,712
<i>It got to where I was proud
that I had the kind of husband...</i>

755
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:09,395
<i>who was willing to risk his neck
just to get us the little extras.</i>

756
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:13,391
But I got Mom to watch the babies
tomorrow night.

757
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:15,311
-Can't do it, Karen.
-Why not?

758
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:17,960
I just can't. I got something lined up.

759
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:21,517
But tomorrow's the only night
she can do it.

760
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:25,036
-Pretty please?
-I can't. What do you want me to do?

761
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,470
-I got to go.
-Wait a minute.

762
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:31,830
I wanted to go shopping.
Can I get some money?

763
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:33,592
How much do you need?

764
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:37,112
-How much?
-That much.

765
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:44,479
This much. Give me a kiss.

766
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:49,478
See you later.

767
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:55,475
All right.

768
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,197
Welcome home, Batts.

769
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:31,557
Hi, how are you?

770
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:35,191
Sit down. Have a drink.
Give them all a drink.

771
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:38,274
And give those Irish hoodlums a drink.

772
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:40,157
There's only one Irishman here.

773
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:42,231
It's a celebration, fellas.

774
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:45,312
-Top of the morning to you.
-It's good to be home.

775
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:51,032
This is my friend Jimmy.

776
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:53,680
Henry. It's his joint. This is Lisa.

777
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,638
Tommy. All dressed up.

778
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:59,632
All grown up and doing the town.
Look at this.

779
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:02,393
Forgot you were having a party
for this mug.

780
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:04,638
Come here.

781
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:06,995
I'll say hello. Billy, how are you?

782
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:09,833
Get over here.
I haven't seen you in six years.

783
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:12,912
Jesus Christ Almighty. You look terrific.

784
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:14,879
Watch the suit.

785
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:18,397
You little prick. I've known you all my life.

786
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:22,634
-Don't get too big on me.
-Just don't bust my balls.

787
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:26,599
If I was gonna break your balls,
I'd say, "Go get your shine box."

788
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:30,435
This kid was great.

789
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:32,636
They used to call him "Spitshine Tommy."

790
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:36,679
He'd make your shoes look like
fucking mirrors. Excuse my language.

791
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:40,594
He was terrific. He was the best.
He made a lot of money, too.

792
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:43,438
No more shines, Billy.

793
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,433
-What?
-I said no more shines.

794
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:48,273
You've been away a long time.
They didn't tell you.

795
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:50,396
I don't shine shoes anymore.

796
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:54,713
Relax. What's got into you?
I'm breaking your balls a little, that's all.

797
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:56,153
I'm only kidding with you.

798
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:59,516
Sometimes you don't sound like it.
There's a lot of people around.

799
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:01,716
I'm only kidding. We're having a party.

800
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:05,429
I haven't seen you in a long time
and you get fucking fresh.

801
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:07,476
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to offend you.

802
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:09,835
I'm sorry, too. It's okay. No problem.

803
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:16,310
Now go home and get your fucking
shine box.

804
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:17,958
Motherfucking mutt!

805
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:20,349
You fucking piece of shit!

806
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:22,712
Come on, come on!

807
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:26,519
He bought his fucking button!
That fake old tough guy!

808
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:28,875
You bought your fucking button!

809
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:31,235
-Don't get nervous.
-You motherfucker!

810
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:33,993
Keep that motherfucker here!
Keep him here.

811
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:37,596
Come on, you fucking feel strong?

812
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:40,752
Sorry. Tommy gets a little loaded.
He doesn't mean any disrespect.

813
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:43,274
He doesn't mean any disrespect?
Are you nuts?

814
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:46,750
Teach this kid a little fucking manners.
What's right is right.

815
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:49,274
-You understand what I'm saying?
-It's all right.

816
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:53,592
We're hugging and kissing over here
and then he acts like a fucking jerk.

817
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:58,238
You insulted him a little bit.
You got a little out of order.

818
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:00,595
-I didn't.
-You insulted him a little.

819
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:03,831
-I didn't insult anybody. Give us a drink.
-Okay.

820
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:06,435
Let's have some drinks.
Drinks on the house.

821
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:08,511
No, have the drink with me.

822
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:11,557
The drinks are on the house.

823
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:16,152
I fucked kids like that in the can.
In the ass.

824
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:18,391
Fucking break up my party.

825
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:28,078
You've been away for six years.
It's different now.

826
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:30,390
I did my fucking time, Jimmy.

827
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:35,273
I came home and I want what I got to get.
I got mouths to feed.

828
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:37,920
-You're gonna get it.
-You understand?

829
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:42,232
Get the door!

830
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:58,835
Let me shoot him
in his big, fucking mouth!

831
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:00,433
Let's shoot him.

832
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:19,556
Fucking mutt dented my shoes.

833
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:22,234
His whole crew is going to be
looking for him.

834
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:28,676
This is bad. What do we do with him?
We can't just dump him on the street.

835
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:32,309
I know a place upstate.
They'll never find him. More tablecloths.

836
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:34,914
I didn't want to get blood on your floor.

837
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:40,232
Go open your trunk.

838
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:46,032
We'll get a shovel at my mother's house.

839
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:58,874
She has a shovel here somewhere.
Quiet, I don't want to wake her up.

840
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:03,068
Look who's here.

841
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:06,191
What did you do? What happened?

842
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:08,794
I hit something on the road.
Jimmy will tell you.

843
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:10,996
What happened to him?

844
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,754
I haven't seen you in so long.
What happened to him?

845
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:17,717
You, too. How are you?

846
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:19,028
Why are you up so late?

847
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:23,352
He came in. You came in.
I'm so happy to see him.

848
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:27,194
Go inside. Make yourselves comfortable.
I'll make you something to eat.

849
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:29,999
-Go to sleep. We're leaving.
-I can't. Not while he's home.

850
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:32,355
I haven't seen him in so long.
I want to see him.

851
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:33,714
You go inside.

852
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:35,119
This stuff is like lead.

853
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:38,237
Tell me, where you been?
I haven't seen you.

854
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:40,993
You haven't called. Where have you been?

855
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:43,958
-I been working nights.
-And?

856
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:45,837
And tonight we were out late.

857
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:49,276
We took a ride out to the country
and hit a deer.

858
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:52,272
That's where all the blood is from.
Jimmy told you.

859
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:55,997
It reminds me, I need this knife.
I'm taking this, okay?

860
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:57,911
-Okay.
-Just for a while.

861
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,433
The poor thing.

862
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:03,195
We hit the deer and his paw....
What do you call it?

863
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:04,918
The paw.

864
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,389
-The hoof.
-Got caught in the grill.

865
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:09,311
I got to hack it off.

866
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:11,675
Ma, it's a sin to leave it there.

867
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:13,557
I'll bring the knife back.

868
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,797
-Delicious.
-Thank you.

869
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,150
Why don't you get yourself a nice girl?

870
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:20,071
I do, almost every night.

871
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:22,674
But get yourself a girl
so you could settle down.

872
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:27,515
I do, every night. Then I'm free.
I love you, I want to be with you.

873
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:28,953
Settle down.

874
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:32,398
How's your friend Henry?

875
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:34,835
What's the matter? You don't talk much.

876
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:36,672
Talk. What are you quiet for?

877
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:39,194
You don't eat much, you don't talk much.

878
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:41,714
-I'm just listening.
-Something wrong?

879
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:45,236
<i>When we were kids,
the compares used to visit each other.</i>

880
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:49,991
There was this man. He would never talk.
He'd just sit there all night, not a word.

881
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:54,518
They say to him, "What's the matter?
Don't you say anything?"

882
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:58,629
He says, "What am I going to say,
that my wife two-times me?"

883
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:02,357
So she says, "Shut up!
You're always talking."

884
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:06,628
But in Italian, it sounds much nicer.

885
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:08,278
<i>-Cornuto contento.
-That's it.</i>

886
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:11,830
-What does that mean?
-It means he's content to be a jerk.

887
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:14,834
He doesn't care who knows it.

888
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:17,674
-Did Tommy tell you about my painting?
-No.

889
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:20,073
Look at this.

890
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:21,588
It's beautiful.

891
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:24,672
I like it. One dog goes one way
and the other goes the other.

892
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:27,149
One's facing east, the other west.
So what?

893
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:30,596
He's saying, "What do you want from me?"
The guy's got nice white hair.

894
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:32,830
Beautiful. The dog looks the same.

895
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:34,831
Looks like somebody we know.

896
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:38,556
Without the beard. It's him.

897
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:42,234
It's him.

898
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:52,713
What the fuck is that?

899
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:55,360
<i>For most of the guys,
killings were accepted.</i>

900
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:58,113
<i>Murder was the only way
everybody stayed in line.</i>

901
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:01,397
<i>You got out of line, you got whacked.
Everybody knew the rules.</i>

902
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:04,870
<i>Sometimes, even if people didn't
get out of line, they got whacked.</i>

903
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:09,272
<i>Hits became a habit. Guys would get
into arguments over nothing.</i>

904
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:11,555
<i>Before you knew it, one was dead.</i>

905
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:13,835
<i>They were shooting each other
all the time.</i>

906
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:17,356
<i>Shooting people was a normal thing.
It was no big deal.</i>

907
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:21,673
<i>We had a serious problem with Billy Batts.</i>

908
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:25,753
<i>This was really a touchy thing.
Tommy killed a made guy.</i>

909
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:29,435
<i>Batts was part of the Gambino crew
and was considered untouchable.</i>

910
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:33,390
<i>Before you touched a made guy,
you had to have a good reason.</i>

911
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:36,199
<i>You had to have a sit-down
and you'd better get an okay...</i>

912
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:38,510
<i>or you'd be the one who got whacked.</i>

913
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:52,071
<i>Saturday night was for wives...</i>

914
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:55,197
<i>but Friday night at the Copa
was for the girlfriends.</i>

915
00:58:56,920 --> 00:58:59,150
Last week, we saw Sammy Davis, Jr.

916
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:02,118
You got to see this show.
What a performer.

917
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:05,636
He does these impersonations.
You'd think it was the real people.

918
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:09,679
It's unbelievable. You could see
how a white girl could fall for him.

919
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,035
What?

920
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:15,952
Not me. But you could see how
some girls could. Like that Swedish girl.

921
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:18,237
So you condone that stuff.

922
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:19,639
Take it easy.

923
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:24,073
I don't want to be kissing
Nat King Cole over here.

924
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:26,037
No, I'm not talking about me.

925
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:29,237
But, you know, he's got personality.

926
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:30,753
Personality?

927
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:35,078
He's talented.
I understand what you're saying.

928
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:38,470
But watch what you say.
People get the wrong impression.

929
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:40,915
I just said he was talented,
you're unbelievable.

930
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,468
Just leave it alone now,
I understand what you said.

931
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:45,551
He's talented. Leave it at that.

932
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:22,270
No? Not even Uncle Paulie?

933
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:40,430
What did you hear about that thing?

934
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:43,958
-The Brooklyn thing?
-No, the guy from downtown.

935
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:47,637
-The guy from where Christie lived?
-No.

936
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:51,832
The guy who disappeared,
the one they made the beef on.

937
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:54,471
-Know the guy I mean?
-Yeah.

938
01:01:54,560 --> 01:01:58,519
His name was Batts. His people
are driving everyone crazy looking for him.

939
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:00,318
Nobody knows what happened to him.

940
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:04,313
He came into the joint that night
and then just disappeared. That was it.

941
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:10,039
All right. Keep your eyes open.
They're busting my balls over it.

942
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:12,431
-All right?
-Yeah.

943
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:16,876
Okay, everybody, let's eat.

944
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:24,398
I want my money.

945
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:26,759
He owes it.

946
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:38,033
You know that thing
we took care of upstate?

947
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:41,430
-Paulie was talking about that.
-Got to get it out of there.

948
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:44,520
They just sold the property
to make condominiums.

949
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:48,115
-It's been six months.
-We got to get it out of there right away.

950
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:04,278
Henry, hurry up. My mother's making
fried peppers and sausage for us.

951
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:09,915
-Here's an arm.
-Very funny, guys.

952
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,433
Here's a leg.

953
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:12,919
Here's a wing.

954
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:17,952
What do you like, the leg or the wing?
Or you still go for the hearts and lungs?

955
01:03:19,120 --> 01:03:20,758
Oh, that's so bad.

956
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:29,072
What happened to the car?

957
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:31,198
I hit a skunk, all right?

958
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:32,952
Go with your mother.

959
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:35,712
It's disgusting, Henry.

960
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:42,438
<i>I set up Janice in an apartment
around the corner from The Suite.</i>

961
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:45,239
<i>That way I was able to stay over
a couple of nights a week.</i>

962
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:46,548
This is my new antique lamp.

963
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:49,677
<i>Karen was home with the kids.
She never asked questions.</i>

964
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:51,591
The furniture's all Maurice Valencia.

965
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:53,272
Looks like Roma.

966
01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:55,555
This is all silk. This is from Siam.

967
01:03:57,480 --> 01:03:59,152
Come see my bedroom.

968
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:03,555
-Tommy, will you take him?
-I'll eat this fucking dog tonight.

969
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:09,396
Love that crystal ball or what?

970
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:13,713
This is where we spend most of our time.

971
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:17,635
I love the floral arrangements.

972
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:20,595
French.

973
01:04:20,680 --> 01:04:24,514
<i>Janice and I were having so much fun,
she started screwing up at work.</i>

974
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:27,034
<i>I had to straighten out her boss a little bit.</i>

975
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:30,635
Janice can do what she wants to do.
Got it?

976
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:34,918
Just try to run. Hang up once more,
and you'll deal with me.

977
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:42,396
Come on, get off of her.

978
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:44,358
You're an animal.

979
01:04:56,760 --> 01:05:00,389
Spider, on your way over here,
bring me a Cutty and water.

980
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:04,950
-Did you guys eat?
-I'm starving.

981
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:08,590
-I'll play these.
-You'll play those?

982
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:10,671
Do I stutter? I play those.

983
01:05:14,360 --> 01:05:16,237
What am I? A mirage?

984
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:19,074
Where's my fucking drink?
I asked you for a drink.

985
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:21,799
-You wanted a drink?
-I asked you for one.

986
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:24,678
I thought you said, "I'm all right, Spider."

987
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:27,351
Am I on a pay-no-mind list?

988
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:31,558
No, I heard someone say "Spider, Spider."

989
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:34,871
-I thought it was Henry.
-You're a mumbling, stuttering little fuck.

990
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:37,030
I thought you said, "I'm all right, Spider."

991
01:05:37,120 --> 01:05:38,792
You ain't all right.

992
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:41,030
No, I thought you said you were all right.

993
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:43,918
I am all right! You ain't, you prick.

994
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:48,997
You've been doing this all fucking night
to me, you motherfucker!

995
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:51,230
He wants a drink now? I'll bring it.

996
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:53,914
Go get me a fucking drink!
Move it, you little prick.

997
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,468
You walk like fucking Stepin Fetchit.

998
01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:58,472
For everybody else you run.

999
01:05:58,560 --> 01:06:02,075
Run for me, you prick!
Dance, dance the fucking drink back here!

1000
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:04,072
What's that movie that Bogart made?

1001
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:06,754
<i>-Where he played a cowboy.
-The Oklahoma Kid.</i>

1002
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:10,799
<i>-Shane?
-Oklahoma Kid, that's me!</i>

1003
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:13,440
You fucking varmint. Dance!

1004
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:15,431
Yahoo, you motherfucker!

1005
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:17,990
Round up those fucking wagons.

1006
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:25,398
Now he's moving.

1007
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:28,880
-Henry, what happened?
-You shot him in the foot, Tommy.

1008
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:33,112
He's fucking fine. So he got shot
in the foot. What is it? A big fucking deal?

1009
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:35,634
-Get a towel.
-Nice fucking game.

1010
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:41,631
Take him to Ben Casey, the little prick.
Let him crawl like he crawls for the drinks.

1011
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:44,720
Take him to the doctor down the street.

1012
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:46,838
Bones are all shattered.

1013
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:48,712
Don't get me upset, now.

1014
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:52,315
Don't make a big fucking thing out of it,
Spider, you little prick.

1015
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:55,039
You trying to make me think
what the fuck I did here.

1016
01:06:55,120 --> 01:06:56,917
It was an accident.

1017
01:06:57,240 --> 01:06:59,435
-Little fucking actor.
-I got a great hand here.

1018
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:00,919
-You in or out?
-Yeah, I'm in.

1019
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,831
-$800.
-$800?

1020
01:07:03,560 --> 01:07:07,030
You haven't been home in two weeks.
You're not going out tonight!

1021
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:10,557
Karen, will you grow up! Stop!
I'm still gonna go out!

1022
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:12,551
Not without your car keys, you're not.

1023
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:14,631
Are you nuts? What's your problem?

1024
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:16,836
Yes, I'm nuts. Something's going on.

1025
01:07:17,040 --> 01:07:19,838
-Stop with that. Enough! Stop with that.
-No!

1026
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:23,509
I'm telling you, I look in your face
and I know that you're lying!

1027
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:27,796
-Get out! Get out!
-Shut up.

1028
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:29,069
Get out of my life!

1029
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:32,072
You're fucked in the head, Karen.
This is all in your mind.

1030
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:34,469
-You're a lousy bastard!
-You got a problem.

1031
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:38,235
Go ahead, go to your ready-made whores.
That's all you're good for!

1032
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:41,790
Get out of my life! I can't stand you!

1033
01:07:52,120 --> 01:07:53,838
Spider, what's your rush?

1034
01:07:56,320 --> 01:07:58,356
-Here you go.
-Thank you, Spider.

1035
01:07:58,440 --> 01:08:02,479
Spider, that fucking bandage on your foot
is bigger than your fucking head.

1036
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:08,075
Next thing you know, he's gonna be
coming in one of these fucking walkers.

1037
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:09,957
Even though you got that, you can dance?

1038
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:14,431
Give us a couple of fucking steps, Spider.
You fucking bullshitter, you.

1039
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:16,875
Tell the truth.
You're looking for sympathy?

1040
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:19,235
Why don't you go fuck yourself, Tommy?

1041
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:26,114
I didn't fucking hear right.
Can't believe what I heard.

1042
01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:28,589
Spider, here. This is for you. Attaboy.

1043
01:08:29,360 --> 01:08:32,272
I got respect for this kid.
He's got a lot of fucking balls.

1044
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:34,874
Good for you.
Don't take no shit off nobody.

1045
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:38,590
He shoots him in the foot,
he tells him to go fuck himself.

1046
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:43,311
Are you gonna let this fucking punk
get away with that?

1047
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:45,994
What's the matter?
What's the world coming to?

1048
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:52,392
That's what the fucking world
is coming to. How do you like that?

1049
01:08:52,480 --> 01:08:55,677
-How's that, all right?
-What's the fucking matter with you?

1050
01:08:55,760 --> 01:08:57,671
What are you, stupid or what?

1051
01:08:57,760 --> 01:09:00,797
Tommy, I'm kidding with you.
Are you a fucking sick maniac?

1052
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:03,917
How do I know if you're kidding?
You're breaking my fucking balls?

1053
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,560
I'm fucking kidding with you,
you fucking shoot the guy?

1054
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:07,789
He's dead.

1055
01:09:09,360 --> 01:09:11,669
Good shot. I'm a lucky man. Good shot.

1056
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:13,113
You can't miss at this distance.

1057
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:15,077
You got a problem
with what I did, Anthony?

1058
01:09:15,160 --> 01:09:16,229
No.

1059
01:09:16,320 --> 01:09:19,949
Fucking rat. His whole family's all rats.
He would've grown up to be a rat.

1060
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:22,190
Stupid bastard! I can't fucking believe you.

1061
01:09:22,280 --> 01:09:25,989
Now you're going to dig the hole.
I got no fucking lime.

1062
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:30,269
I'll dig the hole. I don't give a fuck.
Is it the first hole I dug?

1063
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:33,074
I'll dig the fucking hole.
Where are the shovels?

1064
01:09:34,140 --> 01:09:35,619
<i>-Hello.
-Hello?</i>

1065
01:09:35,820 --> 01:09:38,254
This is Karen Hill. I wanna talk to you.

1066
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:42,019
Hello? Don't hang up on me!

1067
01:09:42,100 --> 01:09:43,897
<i>I want to talk to you!</i>

1068
01:09:44,140 --> 01:09:46,859
<i>You keep away from my husband,
you hear me?</i>

1069
01:09:48,060 --> 01:09:50,449
<i>Hello? Open the door!</i>

1070
01:09:52,260 --> 01:09:53,613
Answer me!

1071
01:09:54,060 --> 01:09:56,494
I'm gonna tell everyone
who walks in this building...

1072
01:09:56,580 --> 01:09:59,253
that in 2R, Rossi,
you are nothing but a whore!

1073
01:09:59,340 --> 01:10:00,978
Is this the superintendent?

1074
01:10:01,060 --> 01:10:03,494
Yes, I want you to know, sir,
that you have a whore...

1075
01:10:03,580 --> 01:10:05,059
<i>living in 2R!</i>

1076
01:10:05,180 --> 01:10:08,138
Rossi, Janice Rossi. Do you hear me?

1077
01:10:08,580 --> 01:10:10,093
<i>He's my husband!</i>

1078
01:10:10,180 --> 01:10:12,774
<i>Get your own goddamn man!</i>

1079
01:10:13,980 --> 01:10:15,459
Wake up, Henry.

1080
01:10:28,300 --> 01:10:29,972
What are you doing?

1081
01:10:32,460 --> 01:10:35,293
-Karen, are you crazy?
-I am crazy.

1082
01:10:36,540 --> 01:10:39,008
I'm crazy enough to kill both of you.

1083
01:10:41,820 --> 01:10:43,492
Karen, take it easy.

1084
01:10:46,860 --> 01:10:48,737
-Okay?
-Do you love her?

1085
01:10:50,260 --> 01:10:51,409
Do you?

1086
01:10:52,420 --> 01:10:54,376
-Do you?
-Karen...

1087
01:10:56,580 --> 01:10:58,889
I love you. You know I love you.

1088
01:11:00,020 --> 01:11:01,692
You don't.

1089
01:11:03,140 --> 01:11:04,778
No, you don't.

1090
01:11:05,380 --> 01:11:07,974
Please, be careful. Baby, don't.

1091
01:11:08,740 --> 01:11:11,971
<i>But still I couldn't hurt him.
How could I hurt him?</i>

1092
01:11:12,060 --> 01:11:14,654
<i>I couldn't even bring myself to leave him.</i>

1093
01:11:14,820 --> 01:11:16,253
<i>The truth was...</i>

1094
01:11:16,340 --> 01:11:18,535
<i>that no matter how bad I felt...</i>

1095
01:11:19,260 --> 01:11:21,615
<i>I was still very attracted to him.</i>

1096
01:11:22,780 --> 01:11:25,055
<i>Why should I give him to someone else?</i>

1097
01:11:25,140 --> 01:11:26,937
<i>Why should she win?</i>

1098
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:32,252
Just put it down.

1099
01:11:33,380 --> 01:11:35,735
You know I love you, don't you?

1100
01:11:35,940 --> 01:11:37,931
You're all I want, Karen.

1101
01:11:39,300 --> 01:11:41,416
Please put the gun down, Karen.

1102
01:11:42,300 --> 01:11:44,814
Baby, come on.

1103
01:11:58,180 --> 01:12:00,455
What are you, fucking crazy, Karen?

1104
01:12:01,780 --> 01:12:04,533
I got enough to worry about
getting whacked on the street!

1105
01:12:04,620 --> 01:12:08,135
I got to fucking come home for this?

1106
01:12:08,660 --> 01:12:10,616
I should fucking kill you!

1107
01:12:11,820 --> 01:12:13,572
How does it feel?

1108
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:16,457
How does it feel, Karen?

1109
01:12:32,420 --> 01:12:34,251
I'm sorry!

1110
01:12:40,940 --> 01:12:42,851
Hi, Jimmy! How are you?

1111
01:12:43,700 --> 01:12:46,658
-Looking good.
-Thank you. Good to see you.

1112
01:12:46,740 --> 01:12:49,174
-Hi, Paulie!
-Hi, honey. How are you?

1113
01:12:49,260 --> 01:12:50,295
Good.

1114
01:12:50,380 --> 01:12:52,974
-Why don't you go get cigarettes, okay?
-Sure.

1115
01:12:53,780 --> 01:12:56,214
-Any of you need anything?
-I'm all right.

1116
01:12:56,500 --> 01:12:59,298
-Want anything to drink? A beer?
-No.

1117
01:12:59,380 --> 01:13:01,848
-Chinese food?
-No, come on, sit down.

1118
01:13:08,380 --> 01:13:10,257
Karen came to the house.

1119
01:13:10,940 --> 01:13:11,577
She's very upset.

1120
01:13:12,060 --> 01:13:14,369
This is no good.
You gotta straighten this thing out.

1121
01:13:14,460 --> 01:13:17,611
We got to have calm now. We don't know
what the hell she's gonna do.

1122
01:13:17,700 --> 01:13:20,009
She's getting all hysterical.
She gets very excited.

1123
01:13:20,100 --> 01:13:23,854
She's wild. And you got to take it easy.
You got children.

1124
01:13:24,580 --> 01:13:27,970
I'm not saying you gotta go back to her
this minute, but you gotta go back.

1125
01:13:28,060 --> 01:13:30,494
It's the only way.
You gotta keep up appearances.

1126
01:13:30,580 --> 01:13:33,014
The two of them come over every day,
commiserating.

1127
01:13:33,100 --> 01:13:34,977
I can't have it.

1128
01:13:36,100 --> 01:13:38,409
I can't do it, Henry.

1129
01:13:38,500 --> 01:13:41,492
Nobody says that you can't do
what you wanna do.

1130
01:13:41,580 --> 01:13:44,219
We all know that. I mean, this is what it is.

1131
01:13:44,300 --> 01:13:47,019
We know what it is.
You have to do the right thing.

1132
01:13:47,100 --> 01:13:49,409
You have to go home to the family,
you understand?

1133
01:13:49,500 --> 01:13:52,014
You got to go home, okay? Look at me.

1134
01:13:52,300 --> 01:13:54,450
You gotta go home. Smarten up.

1135
01:13:55,100 --> 01:13:56,613
-All right?
-All right.

1136
01:13:56,740 --> 01:13:58,298
I'm gonna talk to Karen.

1137
01:13:58,380 --> 01:14:01,770
I'll straighten this out.
I know just what to say to her.

1138
01:14:02,260 --> 01:14:04,216
I'm gonna tell her you'll go back to her...

1139
01:14:04,300 --> 01:14:07,212
and it'll be just the way
it was when you were first married...

1140
01:14:07,300 --> 01:14:09,097
your romance, it's gonna be beautiful.

1141
01:14:09,180 --> 01:14:11,136
I know how to talk to her,
especially to her.

1142
01:14:11,220 --> 01:14:13,734
Jimmy and Tommy are going down
to Tampa this weekend...

1143
01:14:13,820 --> 01:14:15,048
to pick up something for me.

1144
01:14:15,140 --> 01:14:16,653
Instead, you go with Jimmy.

1145
01:14:16,740 --> 01:14:18,173
You come with me, we'll go down.

1146
01:14:18,260 --> 01:14:20,728
Have a good time.
Take some time for yourself. Relax.

1147
01:14:20,820 --> 01:14:22,617
Sit in the sun. Take a couple days off.

1148
01:14:22,700 --> 01:14:24,577
-We'll have a good time.
-Enjoy yourselves.

1149
01:14:24,660 --> 01:14:27,220
And when you come back,
you go back to Karen.

1150
01:14:27,820 --> 01:14:29,492
Please, there's no other way.

1151
01:14:29,580 --> 01:14:32,174
<i>You're not gonna get a divorce.
We're not animali.</i>

1152
01:14:32,260 --> 01:14:34,728
No divorce. She'll never divorce him.

1153
01:14:36,460 --> 01:14:39,258
She'll kill him, but she won't divorce him.

1154
01:14:43,380 --> 01:14:44,972
You gonna pay us?

1155
01:14:51,100 --> 01:14:53,978
-You gonna pay?
-Give us the fucking money!

1156
01:14:54,500 --> 01:14:56,456
I can't, I swear.

1157
01:14:57,980 --> 01:14:59,174
Let's go.

1158
01:15:07,420 --> 01:15:10,014
-We'll throw the bastard to the lions.
-No!

1159
01:15:10,100 --> 01:15:12,773
What fucking lions?
I ain't going near any lions, Jimmy!

1160
01:15:12,860 --> 01:15:15,169
-Let's throw him over the moat.
-All right.

1161
01:15:15,260 --> 01:15:16,579
I'll get the money!

1162
01:15:16,660 --> 01:15:19,333
<i>They must really feed each other
to the lions down there...</i>

1163
01:15:19,420 --> 01:15:21,172
<i>because the guy gave the money right up.</i>

1164
01:15:21,260 --> 01:15:22,898
I swear to Christ, I'll get the money.

1165
01:15:22,980 --> 01:15:24,971
<i>We got to spend the rest of the weekend
at the track.</i>

1166
01:15:25,420 --> 01:15:26,773
Yeah. They mean business.

1167
01:15:26,860 --> 01:15:29,374
<i>Then, I couldn't believe what happened.</i>

1168
01:15:29,780 --> 01:15:32,248
<i>When we got home,
we were all over the newspaper.</i>

1169
01:15:32,340 --> 01:15:35,491
<i>At first, I didn't even know
why we got picked up.</i>

1170
01:15:35,580 --> 01:15:37,696
<i>Then I found out
that the guy we roughed up...</i>

1171
01:15:37,780 --> 01:15:41,090
<i>turned out to have a sister
working as a typist for the FBI.</i>

1172
01:15:41,180 --> 01:15:43,899
<i>Who could believe it?
Of all the fucking people.</i>

1173
01:15:43,980 --> 01:15:47,177
<i>She gave up everybody.:
Jimmy, me, even her brother.</i>

1174
01:15:48,540 --> 01:15:51,293
<i>It took the jury six hours
to bring us in guilty.</i>

1175
01:15:51,420 --> 01:15:54,617
<i>The judge gave Jimmy and me 10 years
like he was giving away candy.</i>

1176
01:15:54,700 --> 01:15:57,260
...ten years in a federal penitentiary.

1177
01:15:57,460 --> 01:16:01,373
You will now be turned over
to the U.S. Attorney General's office.

1178
01:16:05,460 --> 01:16:07,098
Toast, guys.

1179
01:16:07,180 --> 01:16:09,489
Good trip, good life, get out soon.

1180
01:16:09,580 --> 01:16:11,377
Good trip, sweetheart.

1181
01:16:14,180 --> 01:16:16,216
We'll watch the home front.

1182
01:16:17,620 --> 01:16:19,975
Say hello to those blow-job hacks.

1183
01:16:20,980 --> 01:16:24,052
Yeah, motherfuck them
every chance you get.

1184
01:16:29,660 --> 01:16:32,049
I'll call you when I get a chance.

1185
01:16:43,940 --> 01:16:45,134
Now take me to jail.

1186
01:16:49,660 --> 01:16:52,379
<i>In prison, dinner was always a big thing.</i>

1187
01:16:52,700 --> 01:16:56,056
<i>We had a pasta course,
and then we had a meat or a fish.</i>

1188
01:16:56,660 --> 01:16:59,493
<i>Paulie did the prep work.
He was doing a year for contempt...</i>

1189
01:16:59,580 --> 01:17:01,889
<i>and had this wonderful system
for doing the garlic.</i>

1190
01:17:01,980 --> 01:17:04,972
<i>He used a razor,
and he used to slice it so thin...</i>

1191
01:17:05,060 --> 01:17:07,779
<i>that it used to liquefy in the pan
with just a little oil.</i>

1192
01:17:07,860 --> 01:17:09,816
<i>It was a very good system.</i>

1193
01:17:10,020 --> 01:17:12,488
<i>Vinnie was in charge of the tomato sauce.</i>

1194
01:17:12,580 --> 01:17:13,979
Get the smell?

1195
01:17:14,060 --> 01:17:16,779
Three kinds of meat in the meatballs:

1196
01:17:16,860 --> 01:17:18,816
veal, beef, and pork.

1197
01:17:19,180 --> 01:17:21,250
Good, but you gotta have the pork.

1198
01:17:21,340 --> 01:17:22,898
That's the flavor.

1199
01:17:22,980 --> 01:17:26,370
<i>I felt he used too many onions,
but it was still a very good sauce.</i>

1200
01:17:26,460 --> 01:17:29,179
Vinnie, don't put too many onions
in the sauce.

1201
01:17:29,260 --> 01:17:31,774
I didn't put too much onions in, Paul.

1202
01:17:32,060 --> 01:17:33,857
Put three small onions, that's all I did.

1203
01:17:33,940 --> 01:17:36,579
Three onions? How many cans
of tomatoes you put in there?

1204
01:17:36,660 --> 01:17:39,254
-I put two big cans.
-You don't need three onions.

1205
01:17:39,340 --> 01:17:41,331
<i>Johnny Dio did the meat.</i>

1206
01:17:41,420 --> 01:17:43,980
<i>We had no broiler,
so Johnny did everything in pans.</i>

1207
01:17:44,060 --> 01:17:46,176
<i>It used to smell up the joint
something awful...</i>

1208
01:17:46,260 --> 01:17:49,172
<i>and the hacks used to die,
but he still cooked a great steak.</i>

1209
01:17:49,260 --> 01:17:51,694
-How do you like yours?
-Medium rare.

1210
01:17:52,260 --> 01:17:54,296
Medium rare. An aristocrat.

1211
01:17:54,700 --> 01:17:58,375
<i>You know, when you think of prison
you get pictures in your mind...</i>

1212
01:17:58,460 --> 01:18:02,009
<i>of all those old movies
with rows of guys behind bars.</i>

1213
01:18:02,100 --> 01:18:03,931
<i>It wasn't like that for wiseguys.</i>

1214
01:18:04,020 --> 01:18:06,739
<i>It really wasn't that bad,
excepting that I missed Jimmy...</i>

1215
01:18:06,820 --> 01:18:08,253
<i>who was doing his time in Atlanta.</i>

1216
01:18:08,340 --> 01:18:11,252
Give me two steaks
while you're in there, all right?

1217
01:18:12,060 --> 01:18:16,338
<i>Everyone else in the joint was doing
real time, mixed together, living like pigs.</i>

1218
01:18:16,460 --> 01:18:19,418
<i>But we lived alone. We owned the joint.</i>

1219
01:18:19,500 --> 01:18:22,810
We batted them sons of bitches.
You couldn't recognize them.

1220
01:18:22,900 --> 01:18:24,253
Good, they deserved it.

1221
01:18:24,340 --> 01:18:27,616
<i>Even the hacks we couldn't bribe
would never rat on the guys we did.</i>

1222
01:18:27,700 --> 01:18:29,531
...had respect. People loved one another.

1223
01:18:29,620 --> 01:18:30,735
They left their doors open.

1224
01:18:30,820 --> 01:18:31,889
Sorry it took so long.

1225
01:18:31,980 --> 01:18:34,540
The skinny guard's getting to be
a real pain in the ass.

1226
01:18:34,620 --> 01:18:37,692
-We're gonna have to do something.
-I took care of him.

1227
01:18:37,780 --> 01:18:39,498
What'd you bring?

1228
01:18:39,580 --> 01:18:41,013
-Bread.
-Good.

1229
01:18:41,340 --> 01:18:43,570
-Fresh.
-Vinnie, I got your peppers and onions.

1230
01:18:43,660 --> 01:18:45,935
Salami, prosciutto, a lot of cheese.

1231
01:18:46,020 --> 01:18:47,533
Come on, what else?

1232
01:18:47,620 --> 01:18:49,053
-Scotch.
-Nice.

1233
01:18:50,020 --> 01:18:51,772
-Some red wine.
-Okay.

1234
01:18:52,100 --> 01:18:53,977
-Now we can eat.
-I got some white, too.

1235
01:18:54,060 --> 01:18:55,812
Give me the white, too. Beautiful.

1236
01:18:55,900 --> 01:18:58,778
Okay, boys, let's eat.
Come on, it's ready, Vinnie.

1237
01:18:59,340 --> 01:19:00,455
Some more bread.

1238
01:19:00,540 --> 01:19:03,293
Tomorrow we eat sandwiches.
You got to go on a diet, Vinnie.

1239
01:19:03,380 --> 01:19:05,450
-You must be kidding.
-Believe me.

1240
01:19:14,140 --> 01:19:15,732
What are you doing?

1241
01:19:20,620 --> 01:19:22,417
I'll take that.

1242
01:19:24,700 --> 01:19:27,134
-All right, I'll catch you guys later.
-Yeah.

1243
01:19:27,220 --> 01:19:29,450
You going for a walk in the park?

1244
01:19:30,940 --> 01:19:33,932
-Okay, I'll catch you next week. Thanks.
-Okay.

1245
01:19:36,660 --> 01:19:39,254
-Is there any more?
-No, that's it. Have a good weekend.

1246
01:19:39,340 --> 01:19:40,170
-Thanks.
-You too, Henry.

1247
01:19:48,580 --> 01:19:49,729
Mrs. Hill, come here.

1248
01:19:49,820 --> 01:19:50,935
Come on.

1249
01:19:54,180 --> 01:19:56,171
You girls stay right here.

1250
01:19:56,540 --> 01:19:59,771
-I want you to hold hands.
-Okay, go right up to the front.

1251
01:19:59,980 --> 01:20:01,891
-Let's go.
-How you doing?

1252
01:20:01,980 --> 01:20:04,414
-Good, how are you?
-Very well, thank you.

1253
01:20:15,780 --> 01:20:18,419
-What you talking about?
-I saw her name in the register.

1254
01:20:18,500 --> 01:20:20,536
-Jesus Christ.
-You want her to visit you?

1255
01:20:20,620 --> 01:20:24,374
Let her stay up all night crying
and writing letters to the parole board.

1256
01:20:24,460 --> 01:20:27,293
What am I doing here?
Where am I? I'm in jail.

1257
01:20:27,540 --> 01:20:29,690
I can't stop people from coming to see me.

1258
01:20:29,780 --> 01:20:33,011
Good, let her sneak this stuff in
for you every week.

1259
01:20:33,100 --> 01:20:37,537
-Let her fight these bastards every week!
-Look what you're doing! Stop it!

1260
01:20:38,940 --> 01:20:40,134
I'm sorry.

1261
01:20:40,620 --> 01:20:42,975
Let her sneak this shit in for you.

1262
01:20:43,980 --> 01:20:45,777
Will you stop it, Karen?

1263
01:20:46,180 --> 01:20:48,648
-Let her do it!
-Stop it!

1264
01:20:56,500 --> 01:20:59,731
Nobody's helping me. I'm all alone.

1265
01:21:00,620 --> 01:21:02,576
Belle and Morrie are broke.

1266
01:21:02,940 --> 01:21:06,091
I asked your friend Remo
for the money that he owes you.

1267
01:21:06,180 --> 01:21:07,579
You know what he told me?

1268
01:21:07,660 --> 01:21:11,175
He told me to take my kids down
to the police station and get on welfare.

1269
01:21:11,260 --> 01:21:13,171
It's gonna be okay.

1270
01:21:13,340 --> 01:21:17,333
Even Paulie, since he got out, I've never
seen him. I never see anybody anymore.

1271
01:21:17,420 --> 01:21:20,173
It's only you and me.
That's what happens when you go away.

1272
01:21:20,260 --> 01:21:24,094
I told you that we're on our own.
Forget everybody else. Forget Paulie.

1273
01:21:25,060 --> 01:21:28,894
As long as he's on parole,
he doesn't want anybody doing anything.

1274
01:21:31,260 --> 01:21:33,490
-I can't do it.
-Yes, you can. Listen to me.

1275
01:21:33,580 --> 01:21:36,140
All I need for you
is to keep bringing me the stuff.

1276
01:21:36,220 --> 01:21:38,893
I got a guy in here from Pittsburgh
who'll help me move it.

1277
01:21:38,980 --> 01:21:40,493
In a month we're gonna be fine.

1278
01:21:40,580 --> 01:21:42,969
-We won't need anybody.
-I'm afraid.

1279
01:21:43,060 --> 01:21:45,016
I'm afraid if Paulie finds out....

1280
01:21:45,100 --> 01:21:46,419
Don't worry about him.

1281
01:21:46,500 --> 01:21:49,936
He is not helping us out.
Is he putting any food on the table?

1282
01:21:51,020 --> 01:21:52,499
We've gotta help each other.

1283
01:21:52,580 --> 01:21:56,095
We've just gotta be really careful
while we do it.

1284
01:22:00,580 --> 01:22:02,730
I don't want to hear a word
about her anymore.

1285
01:22:02,820 --> 01:22:03,855
Never.

1286
01:22:28,180 --> 01:22:29,772
Daddy!

1287
01:22:31,340 --> 01:22:33,570
-We missed you.
-Are you here to stay?

1288
01:22:33,660 --> 01:22:37,130
Did you see our pictures?
I did the one with the house and rainbow.

1289
01:22:37,220 --> 01:22:38,653
I did the sun.

1290
01:22:38,780 --> 01:22:42,534
My chorus concert is in two weeks.
Are you coming?

1291
01:22:43,340 --> 01:22:45,137
Do you like the house?

1292
01:22:46,340 --> 01:22:48,331
Karen, get packed.
We're moving out of here.

1293
01:22:48,420 --> 01:22:49,455
With what?

1294
01:22:49,660 --> 01:22:52,538
Don't worry with what.
Just start looking for a new house.

1295
01:22:52,620 --> 01:22:56,135
I got to go to Pittsburgh in the morning.
Those guys there owe me $15,000.

1296
01:22:56,220 --> 01:22:58,131
We'll be all right. I got things lined up.

1297
01:22:58,220 --> 01:23:00,973
Pittsburgh? You have to go see
your parole officer tomorrow.

1298
01:23:01,060 --> 01:23:03,858
Don't worry about it.
Everything's gonna be fine.

1299
01:23:04,420 --> 01:23:06,695
-Who wants to go to Uncle Paulie's?
-Me!

1300
01:23:16,580 --> 01:23:18,093
What do you want?

1301
01:23:18,340 --> 01:23:20,296
Sweetheart, let Mommy eat.

1302
01:23:23,620 --> 01:23:26,373
You look good.
Did you eat this good in the joint?

1303
01:23:28,420 --> 01:23:30,217
I don't want any more of that shit.

1304
01:23:30,300 --> 01:23:31,369
What shit?

1305
01:23:31,460 --> 01:23:34,054
-Just stay away from the garbage.
-Look, Paulie--

1306
01:23:34,140 --> 01:23:37,416
I'm not talking about what you did inside.
You did what you had to do.

1307
01:23:37,500 --> 01:23:40,094
I'm talking about now. From now.
Here and now.

1308
01:23:40,820 --> 01:23:43,539
-Why would I get into that?
-Don't make a jerk out of me.

1309
01:23:43,620 --> 01:23:45,133
Just don't do it.

1310
01:23:48,700 --> 01:23:51,612
I want to talk to you about Jimmy.
You gotta watch out for him.

1311
01:23:51,700 --> 01:23:54,419
He's a good earner, but he's wild,
takes too many chances.

1312
01:23:54,500 --> 01:23:56,934
I know Jimmy. You think
I would take chances like him?

1313
01:23:57,020 --> 01:23:58,692
Tommy's a good kid, but he's crazy.

1314
01:23:58,780 --> 01:24:00,532
He's a cowboy.
He's got too much to prove.

1315
01:24:00,620 --> 01:24:02,292
You gotta watch out for kids like this.

1316
01:24:02,380 --> 01:24:04,974
I know what they are.
I only use them for certain things.

1317
01:24:05,060 --> 01:24:07,574
I ain't gonna get fucked like Gribbs,
you understand?

1318
01:24:07,660 --> 01:24:11,972
Gribbs is 70 years old. The fucking guy's
gonna die in prison. I don't need that.

1319
01:24:12,180 --> 01:24:16,014
So I'm warning everybody. Everybody.
Could be my son, could be anybody.

1320
01:24:16,260 --> 01:24:18,899
Gribbs got 20 years just
for saying hello to some fuck...

1321
01:24:18,980 --> 01:24:20,971
who was sneaking behind his back,
selling junk.

1322
01:24:21,060 --> 01:24:23,528
I don't need that.
That won't happen to me, understand?

1323
01:24:23,620 --> 01:24:25,815
You know you're out early
because I got you a job.

1324
01:24:25,900 --> 01:24:27,856
I don't need this heat,
you understand that?

1325
01:24:27,940 --> 01:24:31,728
You see anybody fucking around
with this shit you're gonna tell me, right?

1326
01:24:31,820 --> 01:24:32,969
That means anybody.

1327
01:24:33,060 --> 01:24:34,095
-All right.
-Yeah?

1328
01:24:34,180 --> 01:24:35,693
Yeah. Of course.

1329
01:24:42,740 --> 01:24:46,733
<i>Took me about a week of sneaking around
before I could unload the Pittsburgh stuff.</i>

1330
01:24:46,820 --> 01:24:49,288
<i>But when I did, it was a real score.</i>

1331
01:24:49,380 --> 01:24:51,848
<i>I started using Sandy's place
to mix the stuff.</i>

1332
01:24:51,940 --> 01:24:54,374
<i>And even with Sandy snorting
more than she mixed...</i>

1333
01:24:54,460 --> 01:24:57,054
<i>I could see that
this was a really good business.</i>

1334
01:24:57,140 --> 01:24:59,449
<i>I made $12,000 in my second week.</i>

1335
01:25:00,020 --> 01:25:03,057
<i>I had a down payment on my house
and things were really rolling.</i>

1336
01:25:03,140 --> 01:25:07,213
<i>All I had to do was every once in a while
tell Sandy that I loved her.</i>

1337
01:25:10,660 --> 01:25:12,616
<i>But it was perfect, I'm telling you.</i>

1338
01:25:12,700 --> 01:25:15,168
<i>As long as I kept getting
the stuff from Pittsburgh...</i>

1339
01:25:15,260 --> 01:25:16,932
<i>I knew Paulie would never find out.</i>

1340
01:25:17,020 --> 01:25:20,774
<i>Within a couple of weeks,
it got so big I needed some help.</i>

1341
01:25:21,100 --> 01:25:23,773
<i>So I got Jimmy and Tommy
to come in with me.</i>

1342
01:25:24,140 --> 01:25:25,698
It's fucking great.

1343
01:25:25,780 --> 01:25:26,974
Mr. Conway.

1344
01:25:32,580 --> 01:25:34,411
-Bring your pay slips?
-Yeah.

1345
01:25:37,340 --> 01:25:39,570
Four and a half months of dirt.

1346
01:25:40,700 --> 01:25:42,577
-It's so good.
-I did it.

1347
01:25:43,700 --> 01:25:46,214
-Do you love it?
-It's wonderful.

1348
01:25:46,620 --> 01:25:50,329
And this we just had to have made special.
Go ahead, sit in it, Belle.

1349
01:25:50,420 --> 01:25:52,809
The others you couldn't even sit in.

1350
01:25:53,020 --> 01:25:54,533
Okay, you ready?

1351
01:25:54,620 --> 01:25:56,690
Watch the wall with the rock.

1352
01:26:04,020 --> 01:26:06,739
The electricians did it special. Come on.

1353
01:26:07,860 --> 01:26:09,612
Come on. All right.

1354
01:26:09,700 --> 01:26:13,215
This was imported. It came in two pieces.
Do you believe what they can do?

1355
01:26:13,300 --> 01:26:14,653
It's nice, huh?

1356
01:26:14,740 --> 01:26:16,776
Henry, come over here.
Did you and Jimmy talk?

1357
01:26:16,860 --> 01:26:19,294
I talked to him,
and he's looking into everything.

1358
01:26:19,380 --> 01:26:22,531
This'll make the Air France haul
look like goddamn peanuts.

1359
01:26:22,620 --> 01:26:24,850
-Come on.
-He's gonna do it, right?

1360
01:26:24,940 --> 01:26:26,737
I told you. He'll check everything out.

1361
01:26:26,820 --> 01:26:29,459
He's looking into it.
We'll see what happens. No promises.

1362
01:26:29,540 --> 01:26:33,579
I know. Do you understand?
There's millions in there. And I've been...

1363
01:26:33,660 --> 01:26:37,255
bleeding for this caper, been cultivating
this son of a bitch for two years.

1364
01:26:37,340 --> 01:26:40,332
He owes me $20,000. Once in a lifetime.
I could retire.

1365
01:26:40,420 --> 01:26:44,208
No more nut every week.
No more bullshit. My dream comes true.

1366
01:26:44,300 --> 01:26:46,211
Morrie, let's get a drink.

1367
01:26:46,700 --> 01:26:49,658
<i>These are the guys that Jimmy
put together for what turned out to be...</i>

1368
01:26:49,740 --> 01:26:53,449
<i>the biggest heist in American history.:
the Lufthansa heist.</i>

1369
01:26:54,700 --> 01:26:57,339
<i>Tommy and Carbone were gonna grab
the outside guard...</i>

1370
01:26:57,420 --> 01:26:59,854
<i>and make him get us in the front door.</i>

1371
01:27:01,060 --> 01:27:04,177
<i>Frenchy and Joe Buddha
had to round up the workers.</i>

1372
01:27:04,740 --> 01:27:08,699
<i>Johnny Roastbeef had to keep them
all tied up and away from the alarms.</i>

1373
01:27:09,300 --> 01:27:11,495
<i>Even Stacks Edwards got in on it.</i>

1374
01:27:11,580 --> 01:27:15,050
<i>He used to hang around the lounge
and play guitar. Everybody loved Stacks.</i>

1375
01:27:15,140 --> 01:27:17,608
<i>What he was supposed to do
was steal the panel truck...</i>

1376
01:27:17,700 --> 01:27:20,692
<i>and afterwards compact it
by a friend of ours out in Jersey.</i>

1377
01:27:20,780 --> 01:27:23,135
<i>Only Morrie was driving us nuts.</i>

1378
01:27:23,220 --> 01:27:25,131
Morrie, have a drink and shut up.

1379
01:27:25,220 --> 01:27:28,337
<i>Just because he set this up,
he felt he could bust Jimmy's balls...</i>

1380
01:27:28,420 --> 01:27:30,888
<i>for an advance on the money
we were going to steal.</i>

1381
01:27:30,980 --> 01:27:34,450
<i>He didn't mean anything by it.
That's just the way he was.</i>

1382
01:27:41,020 --> 01:27:44,979
<i>I had everybody working for me.
Even our old baby-sitter, Lois Byrd.</i>

1383
01:27:47,860 --> 01:27:49,259
Did you have a good flight?

1384
01:27:49,340 --> 01:27:51,900
I hate Pittsburgh.
Where did you find such creeps?

1385
01:27:51,980 --> 01:27:53,891
Come on, they're not that bad.

1386
01:27:54,980 --> 01:27:56,777
And it's worth it, isn't it?

1387
01:27:57,060 --> 01:27:59,449
Is this the same baby you used last week?

1388
01:27:59,540 --> 01:28:02,532
No, that one was my sister's.
This is Deirdra's.

1389
01:28:03,460 --> 01:28:04,654
Big yawn.

1390
01:28:04,740 --> 01:28:06,412
She looks just like you.

1391
01:28:07,060 --> 01:28:09,290
That's what the stewardess said.

1392
01:28:21,420 --> 01:28:23,331
Take it easy, Sandy.

1393
01:28:23,420 --> 01:28:26,093
Come on, give me a break.
You got enough here to go around.

1394
01:28:26,180 --> 01:28:29,490
You got all day. Just make it last,
all right? Take it easy.

1395
01:28:29,860 --> 01:28:31,657
-I got to go.
-Where are you going?

1396
01:28:31,740 --> 01:28:35,699
Don't start. You know I gotta go
do this thing. Fuck, where are my keys?

1397
01:28:36,940 --> 01:28:38,293
Over there.

1398
01:28:38,380 --> 01:28:39,972
It's a mess. It's like a pig pen.

1399
01:28:40,060 --> 01:28:42,096
What do you think
I got you the dishwasher for?

1400
01:28:42,180 --> 01:28:44,057
I hate doing the dishes. Fucks up my nails.

1401
01:28:44,140 --> 01:28:45,937
How could you hate it?
You got to be smart.

1402
01:28:46,020 --> 01:28:49,171
Look at all this powder around here.
That could put us away forever.

1403
01:28:49,260 --> 01:28:51,410
-Loosen up.
-What are you doing?

1404
01:28:52,380 --> 01:28:55,611
-You know, I gotta....
-You don't have to go anywhere.

1405
01:28:56,700 --> 01:28:58,179
Make them wait.

1406
01:29:07,100 --> 01:29:10,729
<i>Nobody knows for sure just how much
was taken in the daring pre-dawn raid...</i>

1407
01:29:10,820 --> 01:29:13,414
<i>at the Lufthansa cargo terminal
at Kennedy Airport.</i>

1408
01:29:13,500 --> 01:29:17,095
<i>The FBI says $2 million,
Port Authority Police say $4 million--</i>

1409
01:29:20,300 --> 01:29:22,336
Jimmy!

1410
01:29:22,420 --> 01:29:24,251
Those sons of bitches!

1411
01:29:24,340 --> 01:29:26,649
<i>...from the scene of the heist at JFK.</i>

1412
01:29:26,740 --> 01:29:30,255
<i>It looks like a big one. Maybe the biggest
this town has ever seen.</i>

1413
01:29:32,060 --> 01:29:34,130
Come here, you! Come here!

1414
01:29:35,180 --> 01:29:37,774
Look at this genius. This genius!

1415
01:29:42,020 --> 01:29:43,851
Merry Christmas.

1416
01:29:48,500 --> 01:29:50,775
-Hello, who's this?
-That's my wife.

1417
01:29:51,380 --> 01:29:54,577
Come here.
I want to show you something, Jimmy.

1418
01:29:57,140 --> 01:29:58,539
Isn't she gorgeous?

1419
01:29:58,620 --> 01:30:01,692
I bought it for my wife.
It's a coupe. I love that car.

1420
01:30:04,380 --> 01:30:07,178
What did I tell you?
I talked to you before, didn't I?

1421
01:30:07,260 --> 01:30:08,613
Didn't I say what was going on?

1422
01:30:08,700 --> 01:30:10,816
Didn't I say not to go buy anything
for a while?

1423
01:30:10,900 --> 01:30:13,812
-The fucking car?
-It's a wedding gift from my mother.

1424
01:30:13,900 --> 01:30:16,016
It's under her name. I just got married.

1425
01:30:16,100 --> 01:30:18,853
-I love that car.
-Excuse me, darling, for just a second.

1426
01:30:18,940 --> 01:30:21,215
-I just got married.
-Are you nuts?

1427
01:30:21,300 --> 01:30:23,689
-What are you getting excited for?
-Are you stupid?

1428
01:30:23,780 --> 01:30:26,453
We got a million bulls out there.
Everybody's watching us.

1429
01:30:26,540 --> 01:30:28,337
And you get a fucking car. I'm excited?

1430
01:30:28,420 --> 01:30:30,615
It's under my mother's name.
It's a wedding gift.

1431
01:30:30,700 --> 01:30:32,531
I don't give a fuck. Are you stupid?

1432
01:30:32,620 --> 01:30:34,770
Didn't you hear what I said?
Don't buy anything.

1433
01:30:34,860 --> 01:30:38,455
Don't get anything. Nothing big.
What's the matter with you?

1434
01:30:38,620 --> 01:30:40,099
What are you getting excited for?

1435
01:30:40,180 --> 01:30:43,570
Because you're going to get us all
fucking pinched. What are you, stupid?

1436
01:30:43,660 --> 01:30:46,299
-What's the matter with you?
-I apologize.

1437
01:30:47,620 --> 01:30:50,692
-I'm sorry.
-What the fuck is the matter with you?

1438
01:30:52,900 --> 01:30:54,174
I'm sorry.

1439
01:30:56,700 --> 01:31:00,056
I'm sorry, Jimmy.
It's under my mother's name.

1440
01:31:00,700 --> 01:31:03,339
What'd you say? You being
a fucking wise guy with me?

1441
01:31:03,420 --> 01:31:06,218
-I'm sorry. I apologize.
-What did I tell you?

1442
01:31:06,620 --> 01:31:09,578
What did I tell you?
You don't buy anything, you hear me?

1443
01:31:09,660 --> 01:31:11,298
Don't buy anything!

1444
01:31:11,380 --> 01:31:12,938
I'm sorry, Jimmy.

1445
01:31:16,020 --> 01:31:18,375
The fat fuck, he ought to wear a sign.

1446
01:31:25,500 --> 01:31:27,809
I can't believe this.
Are you stupid or what?

1447
01:31:27,900 --> 01:31:29,174
Excuse me.

1448
01:31:29,420 --> 01:31:31,092
-What's the matter?
-Take it off.

1449
01:31:31,180 --> 01:31:34,058
-Why? What's the matter?
-Take it off!

1450
01:31:36,140 --> 01:31:39,576
Didn't I tell you not to get anything big
and not to attract attention?

1451
01:31:39,660 --> 01:31:42,697
In two days, one guy gets a Caddy
and one gets a $20,000 mink.

1452
01:31:42,780 --> 01:31:44,657
-Bring it fucking back.
-I'll bring it back.

1453
01:31:44,740 --> 01:31:48,176
I don't care what you do.
Bring it where you got it before.

1454
01:31:48,260 --> 01:31:51,013
-Get it out of here!
-All right. Let's go, honey.

1455
01:31:54,980 --> 01:31:57,016
Shut the fuck up and let's go.

1456
01:31:59,940 --> 01:32:02,374
This drink here is better than sex, babe.

1457
01:32:04,260 --> 01:32:08,299
I'm gonna go see Stacks. Don't you look
at anybody or I'll fucking kill you.

1458
01:32:08,380 --> 01:32:12,453
He's so jealous. If I even look
at anyone else, he'll kill me.

1459
01:32:12,660 --> 01:32:14,093
That's great.

1460
01:32:14,220 --> 01:32:17,178
Tell them all to relax.
Don't attract attention.

1461
01:32:20,140 --> 01:32:21,971
I've been looking all over for you.

1462
01:32:22,060 --> 01:32:23,652
How are you? Merry Christmas.

1463
01:32:23,740 --> 01:32:25,696
Listen, I need the money.

1464
01:32:26,060 --> 01:32:29,450
-Morrie, relax, okay? It's Christmas.
-Jimmy, I need the money.

1465
01:32:29,540 --> 01:32:31,690
I'm relaxing. I need the money.

1466
01:32:31,780 --> 01:32:34,738
-I did what I had to do. I need the money.
-Not tonight, Morrie.

1467
01:32:34,820 --> 01:32:38,654
Listen, I did my caper. He owes me.
Everybody's flashing their stuff.

1468
01:32:38,740 --> 01:32:41,459
Evidently, they got their money.
I'm wearing the same shit.

1469
01:32:41,540 --> 01:32:44,850
-Just not tonight.
-They're wearing it. I gotta talk to him.

1470
01:32:47,100 --> 01:32:49,614
I got $500,000 coming to me.

1471
01:32:49,700 --> 01:32:52,134
The biggest fucking bundle
he ever made in his life.

1472
01:32:52,220 --> 01:32:54,814
Morrie, I'll go talk to him.
Go have a drink, all right?

1473
01:32:54,900 --> 01:32:56,970
-I'll talk to him.
-It's poison in my eyes.

1474
01:32:57,060 --> 01:32:59,858
-Morris, baby, are you all right?
-No, I'm not.

1475
01:33:05,380 --> 01:33:08,611
Christmas. Your share. Just a little taste.

1476
01:33:11,660 --> 01:33:12,934
We did it!

1477
01:33:15,820 --> 01:33:17,458
-Jimmy.
-Yeah.

1478
01:33:18,060 --> 01:33:19,971
-Yeah, who is it?
-It's me.

1479
01:33:20,060 --> 01:33:21,618
Pete? One second.

1480
01:33:22,180 --> 01:33:25,411
Don't do what Frankie and Johnny did.
Don't be a moron with the money.

1481
01:33:25,500 --> 01:33:27,252
-Do what's right, you understand?
-Yeah.

1482
01:33:27,980 --> 01:33:30,448
Karen, Judy, Ruth, come here!

1483
01:33:30,980 --> 01:33:33,574
I got the most expensive tree they had.

1484
01:33:34,980 --> 01:33:38,450
-What do you think, Mommy?
-I love them all.

1485
01:33:38,660 --> 01:33:40,218
I love the gold outfit.

1486
01:33:40,300 --> 01:33:42,052
-Merry Christmas.
-Thank you.

1487
01:33:42,140 --> 01:33:43,539
-What?
-Merry Christmas.

1488
01:33:43,620 --> 01:33:44,894
And?

1489
01:33:45,260 --> 01:33:46,739
Happy Hanukkah.

1490
01:33:47,580 --> 01:33:50,697
-Very funny.
-Go get yourself something nice, okay?

1491
01:33:58,700 --> 01:34:02,852
<i>Lufthansa should have been
our ultimate score. The heist of a lifetime.</i>

1492
01:34:03,420 --> 01:34:06,537
<i>$6 million in cash.
More than enough to go around.</i>

1493
01:34:16,140 --> 01:34:17,539
Yo, Stacks!

1494
01:34:17,900 --> 01:34:20,414
Open up! What's up? What're you doing?

1495
01:34:26,420 --> 01:34:30,095
What's with you? He ain't ready.
I knew you wouldn't be ready.

1496
01:34:30,180 --> 01:34:33,490
-You didn't bring any coffee?
-What do I look like, a fucking caterer?

1497
01:34:33,580 --> 01:34:36,731
Frankie will make coffee.
Go ahead, Frankie, make coffee.

1498
01:34:39,340 --> 01:34:41,410
Thought you had
one of your bitches in here.

1499
01:34:41,500 --> 01:34:43,809
Yeah, I did. Where the fuck is she?

1500
01:34:44,780 --> 01:34:47,692
Always got these hot books around,
or a bitch, or something.

1501
01:34:47,780 --> 01:34:49,008
What time is it?

1502
01:34:49,100 --> 01:34:52,979
-It's 11:30. We had to be there by 9:00.
-I'll be ready in a minute.

1503
01:34:53,060 --> 01:34:56,894
You're always fucking late.
You'd be late for your own fucking funeral.

1504
01:35:01,580 --> 01:35:05,334
What the fuck you looking at?
Make that coffee to go. Let's go.

1505
01:35:08,340 --> 01:35:10,217
What the fuck you doing? It's a joke.

1506
01:35:10,300 --> 01:35:13,212
Put the fucking pot down.
You gonna take the coffee?

1507
01:35:32,060 --> 01:35:33,937
<i>Stacks was always crazy.</i>

1508
01:35:34,260 --> 01:35:37,855
<i>Instead of getting rid of the truck
as he was supposed to, he got stoned...</i>

1509
01:35:37,940 --> 01:35:42,377
<i>went to his girlfriend's, and by the time
he woke up, the cops had found the truck.</i>

1510
01:35:42,460 --> 01:35:44,530
<i>It was all over the television.</i>

1511
01:35:44,620 --> 01:35:47,612
<i>They even said they came up
with prints off the wheel.</i>

1512
01:35:48,180 --> 01:35:51,490
<i>It was just a matter of time
before they got to Stacks.</i>

1513
01:36:02,780 --> 01:36:04,498
I gotta talk to you.

1514
01:36:04,740 --> 01:36:07,208
-Have a drink.
-Have a drink. Come on.

1515
01:36:07,700 --> 01:36:11,329
Have a drink. What you doing?
It's an occasion. Have a drink.

1516
01:36:12,620 --> 01:36:14,576
I still gotta talk to you.

1517
01:36:14,900 --> 01:36:15,935
What?

1518
01:36:16,020 --> 01:36:18,488
-What happened with Stacks?
-Don't worry about that.

1519
01:36:18,580 --> 01:36:22,209
-There's feds all over the place.
-So what? Where are they gonna go?

1520
01:36:22,700 --> 01:36:25,134
-It's in the papers.
-He's worried.

1521
01:36:25,620 --> 01:36:27,372
What are you worried about?

1522
01:36:27,460 --> 01:36:30,816
The television and the newspapers.
All the shit's out there.

1523
01:36:30,900 --> 01:36:34,017
-What are you worried about?
-You worry too much.

1524
01:36:34,300 --> 01:36:36,894
Everything is beautiful.
There's nothing to worry about.

1525
01:36:36,980 --> 01:36:39,335
-Didn't you tell him?
-I didn't tell him yet.

1526
01:36:39,420 --> 01:36:40,819
-What?
-Guess what?

1527
01:36:42,340 --> 01:36:43,978
They're gonna make him.

1528
01:36:45,540 --> 01:36:47,371
Paulie's going to make you?

1529
01:36:48,140 --> 01:36:49,289
Tommy.

1530
01:36:49,380 --> 01:36:51,894
They opened up the books.
Paulie got the okay.

1531
01:36:51,980 --> 01:36:54,619
You believe that?
This little guinea bastard.

1532
01:36:55,500 --> 01:36:59,812
He's gonna get made. We're gonna work
for this guy one day. He's gonna be a boss.

1533
01:37:00,780 --> 01:37:02,372
I can't believe it.

1534
01:37:02,460 --> 01:37:04,610
I'm really happy for you.
Great. Congratulations.

1535
01:37:04,700 --> 01:37:06,611
Motherfuckers, we got them now.

1536
01:37:07,380 --> 01:37:11,498
Jimmy, I've been looking all over for you.
Can I talk to you a second?

1537
01:37:12,220 --> 01:37:14,529
I mastermind the goddamn thing,
I'm left with dick.

1538
01:37:14,620 --> 01:37:18,010
They'd be up a creek if not for me.
Fuck him ! I want my money.

1539
01:37:18,220 --> 01:37:20,290
I want my money! I've had it up to here!

1540
01:37:20,380 --> 01:37:22,655
That cheap cigarette hijacker.

1541
01:37:22,780 --> 01:37:25,453
-Fuck him ! I want my money!
-Good. Go tell him.

1542
01:37:28,100 --> 01:37:30,773
You're gonna keep your mouth shut,
or what?

1543
01:37:32,340 --> 01:37:34,217
Morrie, you're gonna get your money.

1544
01:37:34,300 --> 01:37:36,655
You just got to stop busting balls.

1545
01:37:37,060 --> 01:37:39,893
All right? Look at me. You hear me?
Look at me, okay?

1546
01:37:39,980 --> 01:37:42,050
Everything's going to be fine.

1547
01:37:47,940 --> 01:37:48,975
Henry.

1548
01:37:54,340 --> 01:37:58,094
Sweetheart, half mick, half guinea?
I'll sing with an Italian accent.

1549
01:38:38,260 --> 01:38:41,491
<i>I could see for the first time
that Jimmy was a nervous wreck.</i>

1550
01:38:41,580 --> 01:38:44,731
<i>His mind was going in
eight different directions at once.</i>

1551
01:38:46,820 --> 01:38:49,209
Think Morrie tells his wife everything?

1552
01:38:49,460 --> 01:38:50,813
Morrie? Him?

1553
01:38:51,340 --> 01:38:54,173
<i>That's when I knew
Jimmy was going to whack Morrie.</i>

1554
01:38:54,260 --> 01:38:58,412
<i>That's how it happens. That's how fast
it takes for a guy to get whacked.</i>

1555
01:38:59,060 --> 01:39:01,415
He's a nut job. He talks to everybody.

1556
01:39:01,500 --> 01:39:04,890
Acts like a jerk in his commercials.
Nobody listens to what he says.

1557
01:39:04,980 --> 01:39:08,052
Nobody fucking cares what he says,
he talks so much.

1558
01:39:08,260 --> 01:39:10,820
Make sure you bring him here tonight.

1559
01:39:10,940 --> 01:39:12,498
-Okay?
-All right.

1560
01:39:14,820 --> 01:39:17,653
Start like this. Sorry.
Did I get you in the eye?

1561
01:39:17,740 --> 01:39:19,696
Stop breaking my balls, all right?

1562
01:39:19,780 --> 01:39:21,657
<i>I was just stalling for time.</i>

1563
01:39:22,300 --> 01:39:26,213
<i>I knew I still had till 8.:00 or 9.:00
to talk Jimmy out of killing Morrie.</i>

1564
01:39:26,420 --> 01:39:30,333
<i>But meanwhile, as far as Jimmy knew,
I was going along with the program.</i>

1565
01:39:30,420 --> 01:39:34,049
I pulled his hair out of his fucking head.
I bit him. He's out cold.

1566
01:39:36,100 --> 01:39:38,330
I'm enraged.
I wanted to kill this little fuck.

1567
01:39:38,420 --> 01:39:41,218
I walk away.
We start to go in the fucking joint.

1568
01:39:41,580 --> 01:39:44,811
I don't want to turn around.
Jimmy's going like this to me.

1569
01:39:45,180 --> 01:39:46,977
I don't want to fucking turn around.

1570
01:39:47,060 --> 01:39:50,848
I don't want to turn around. He picks up
his fucking head, he says....

1571
01:39:51,740 --> 01:39:53,537
I said, "Don't say it."

1572
01:39:58,220 --> 01:39:59,494
"Jerkoff! "

1573
01:40:02,140 --> 01:40:05,576
What are you going to do? What?
I fucking fly at him.

1574
01:40:05,660 --> 01:40:08,572
I got him and I'm banging his head,
banging his fucking face.

1575
01:40:08,660 --> 01:40:10,412
I'm pulling his hair out of his head.

1576
01:40:10,500 --> 01:40:13,458
I beat him to a pulp. To a pulp I beat him.

1577
01:40:13,540 --> 01:40:16,418
He's laying there full of fucking blood.
I'm out of breath.

1578
01:40:16,500 --> 01:40:19,014
Forget about tonight. Forget about it.

1579
01:40:19,820 --> 01:40:21,776
<i>It was a load off my mind.</i>

1580
01:40:22,820 --> 01:40:24,048
<i>Poor bastard.</i>

1581
01:40:24,140 --> 01:40:26,449
<i>He never knew how close he'd come
to getting killed.</i>

1582
01:40:26,540 --> 01:40:29,452
<i>Even if I told him,
he would have never believed me.</i>

1583
01:40:30,900 --> 01:40:34,734
-Jimmy, could I talk to you now?
-You're a pisser. A real pisser.

1584
01:40:35,300 --> 01:40:38,497
Want to talk now? Okay, let's talk.
Let's get it over with.

1585
01:40:38,580 --> 01:40:41,492
I've never met a ball buster like you,
my whole life.

1586
01:40:41,580 --> 01:40:43,616
Who loves you more than I do?

1587
01:40:43,700 --> 01:40:46,897
-I'd do anything for you.
-Except to stop busting my balls.

1588
01:40:47,780 --> 01:40:50,135
-Let's go have coffee.
-Want to go to the diner?

1589
01:40:50,220 --> 01:40:52,529
We'll go to the diner on the boulevard.

1590
01:40:53,060 --> 01:40:55,938
-Which diner?
-Rockaway Boulevard. It's open 24 hours.

1591
01:40:56,020 --> 01:40:58,136
-They got Danishes?
-They got everything.

1592
01:40:58,220 --> 01:41:00,495
Let's pick up some Danishes for Belle.

1593
01:41:01,060 --> 01:41:05,053
Hear about the points we were shaving
up in Boston? It's terrific. Nunzio--

1594
01:41:12,940 --> 01:41:14,498
I thought he'd never shut up.

1595
01:41:14,580 --> 01:41:16,252
What a pain in the ass.

1596
01:41:16,340 --> 01:41:19,138
-What'll we do with him?
-Chop him up and get rid of the car.

1597
01:41:19,220 --> 01:41:21,131
Call me when you're through.

1598
01:41:21,220 --> 01:41:23,609
-Frank, let's chop him up.
-All right.

1599
01:41:23,700 --> 01:41:26,214
Where you going,
you dizzy motherfucker, you?

1600
01:41:26,300 --> 01:41:27,335
You said chop him up.

1601
01:41:27,420 --> 01:41:30,696
At Charlie's, not here!
Where are you gonna chop him here?

1602
01:41:31,620 --> 01:41:34,214
Come on, what are you doing?
Get out of here.

1603
01:41:34,300 --> 01:41:36,370
I got a better shot letting him drive.

1604
01:41:36,460 --> 01:41:38,212
The car's cold.

1605
01:41:38,300 --> 01:41:41,736
Get the fuck out of here!
What, warm it up? Get out of here!

1606
01:41:42,540 --> 01:41:44,974
-Who is it?
-It's Belle. Open up.

1607
01:41:45,060 --> 01:41:46,698
It's Belle. Let me in.

1608
01:41:47,540 --> 01:41:51,249
Morris didn't come home. He's missing.
I know something's happened.

1609
01:41:51,340 --> 01:41:52,614
Calm down.

1610
01:41:52,900 --> 01:41:55,289
He's missing! I know something happened.

1611
01:41:55,380 --> 01:41:57,575
He's probably drunk
and fell asleep somewhere.

1612
01:41:57,660 --> 01:42:01,255
In 27 years, he's never been away all night
without calling.

1613
01:42:01,340 --> 01:42:04,093
I know something's happened.
I know you know.

1614
01:42:04,180 --> 01:42:07,650
Let me get changed.
I'll take you home, then look for him.

1615
01:42:07,820 --> 01:42:10,971
-I've been home! I've been on the phone--
-He's playing cards.

1616
01:42:14,220 --> 01:42:16,654
-What'll I tell Belle?
-Who gives a fuck?

1617
01:42:17,500 --> 01:42:20,856
Tell her he ran off with some broad.
What do you care?

1618
01:42:20,940 --> 01:42:22,976
-Watch this.
-Don't fuck with them.

1619
01:42:23,060 --> 01:42:25,016
I do it all the time. I'll bust their balls.

1620
01:42:25,100 --> 01:42:27,853
Don't give them the satisfaction,
the fucks.

1621
01:42:30,220 --> 01:42:32,450
Come on, fuckos. Let's go for a ride.

1622
01:42:33,700 --> 01:42:35,372
Keep them up all night.

1623
01:42:36,260 --> 01:42:37,773
I'll see you later.

1624
01:43:25,380 --> 01:43:28,497
<i>Jimmy was cutting every link
between himself and the robbery...</i>

1625
01:43:28,580 --> 01:43:30,889
<i>but it had nothing to do with me.</i>

1626
01:43:40,980 --> 01:43:44,131
<i>I gave Jimmy the tip and he gave me
some Christmas money.</i>

1627
01:43:45,860 --> 01:43:48,169
<i>From then on, I kept my mouth shut.</i>

1628
01:43:48,260 --> 01:43:52,048
<i>I knew Jimmy. He had the cash. It was his.</i>

1629
01:43:52,140 --> 01:43:55,337
<i>He kicked some money upstairs to Paulie,
but that was it.</i>

1630
01:43:56,420 --> 01:43:59,776
<i>It made him sick to turn the money over
to the guys who stole it.</i>

1631
01:43:59,860 --> 01:44:02,658
<i>He'd rather whack them.
Anyway, what did I care?</i>

1632
01:44:02,740 --> 01:44:04,571
<i>I wasn't asking for anything.</i>

1633
01:44:04,660 --> 01:44:08,255
<i>And Jimmy was making nice money
through my Pittsburgh connections.</i>

1634
01:44:08,700 --> 01:44:12,579
<i>Still, months after the robbery
they were finding bodies all over.</i>

1635
01:44:33,700 --> 01:44:36,419
<i>When they found Carbone
in the meat truck...</i>

1636
01:44:36,500 --> 01:44:38,138
<i>he was frozen so stiff...</i>

1637
01:44:38,220 --> 01:44:41,212
<i>it took them two days
to thaw him out for the autopsy.</i>

1638
01:44:45,860 --> 01:44:47,930
<i>Still, I never saw Jimmy so happy.</i>

1639
01:44:48,300 --> 01:44:51,815
<i>He was like a kid. We had money
coming in through my Pittsburgh people...</i>

1640
01:44:51,900 --> 01:44:55,290
<i>and even after a while,
the Lufthansa thing began to calm down.</i>

1641
01:44:55,460 --> 01:44:57,610
<i>What made Jimmy so happy
that morning...</i>

1642
01:44:57,700 --> 01:45:00,612
<i>was that this was the day
that Tommy was being made.</i>

1643
01:45:00,940 --> 01:45:03,852
<i>Jimmy was so excited,
you'd think he was being made.</i>

1644
01:45:04,420 --> 01:45:06,980
<i>He must have made four calls
to Tommy's house.</i>

1645
01:45:07,140 --> 01:45:11,019
<i>They had a signal set up, so he'd know
the minute the ceremony was over.</i>

1646
01:45:11,780 --> 01:45:13,896
-Ma, where are you?
-Here I am.

1647
01:45:14,500 --> 01:45:16,968
-You're home.
-Home? I'm leaving.

1648
01:45:17,380 --> 01:45:19,894
-You look lovely.
-I look good, huh?

1649
01:45:19,980 --> 01:45:23,256
You look wonderful. Be careful.
Congratulations.

1650
01:45:23,900 --> 01:45:27,131
I love you. Don't paint
any more religious pictures, please.

1651
01:45:27,220 --> 01:45:28,858
-God be with you.
-Bye, Ma.

1652
01:45:28,940 --> 01:45:31,249
<i>We always called each other goodfellas.</i>

1653
01:45:31,340 --> 01:45:32,978
<i>You'd say to somebody.:</i>

1654
01:45:33,060 --> 01:45:37,099
<i>"You'll like this guy. He's all right.
He's a goodfella, one of us. "</i>

1655
01:45:37,460 --> 01:45:38,779
<i>You understand?</i>

1656
01:45:39,420 --> 01:45:41,650
<i>We were goodfellas. Wiseguys.</i>

1657
01:45:44,020 --> 01:45:47,296
<i>But Jimmy and I could never be made
because we had Irish blood.</i>

1658
01:45:47,380 --> 01:45:49,769
<i>It didn't matter my mother was Sicilian.</i>

1659
01:45:50,020 --> 01:45:53,854
<i>To become a member of a crew,
you've got to be 100% Italian...</i>

1660
01:45:53,940 --> 01:45:57,091
<i>so they can trace your relatives
back to the old country.</i>

1661
01:46:03,860 --> 01:46:06,169
<i>It's the highest honor they can give you.</i>

1662
01:46:06,260 --> 01:46:08,728
<i>It means you belong
to a family and a crew.</i>

1663
01:46:09,020 --> 01:46:11,454
<i>It means nobody can fuck around
with you.</i>

1664
01:46:11,940 --> 01:46:14,329
<i>It also means you could
fuck around with anybody...</i>

1665
01:46:14,420 --> 01:46:16,809
<i>just as long as they aren't also a member.</i>

1666
01:46:16,900 --> 01:46:20,210
<i>It's like a license to steal.
A license to do anything.</i>

1667
01:46:22,300 --> 01:46:24,256
How many years ago
since you were made?

1668
01:46:24,340 --> 01:46:27,059
-I'm an old-timer. 30 years ago.
-Thirty years?

1669
01:46:27,140 --> 01:46:31,258
Brings back a lot of memories.
Pike's Peak was a pimple then, wasn't it?

1670
01:46:34,380 --> 01:46:37,292
<i>As far as Jimmy was concerned,
with Tommy being made...</i>

1671
01:46:37,380 --> 01:46:39,689
<i>it was like we were all being made.</i>

1672
01:46:40,540 --> 01:46:43,100
<i>We would now have
one of our own as a member.</i>

1673
01:46:58,300 --> 01:46:59,892
<i>-Who's this?
-This is Vinnie.</i>

1674
01:46:59,980 --> 01:47:02,778
Vinnie. What happened?
Did we get straightened out?

1675
01:47:02,860 --> 01:47:05,818
<i>No, we had a problem.
We tried to do everything we could.</i>

1676
01:47:05,900 --> 01:47:06,935
What do you mean?

1677
01:47:07,020 --> 01:47:11,013
<i>You know what I mean. He's gone,
and we couldn't do nothing about it.</i>

1678
01:47:12,860 --> 01:47:14,691
<i>-That's it.
-What do you mean?</i>

1679
01:47:14,780 --> 01:47:16,099
<i>He's gone.</i>

1680
01:47:17,980 --> 01:47:19,049
<i>That's it.</i>

1681
01:47:23,700 --> 01:47:26,373
I knew it! I can't fucking believe it.

1682
01:47:36,380 --> 01:47:38,450
-What happened?
-They fucking whacked him.

1683
01:47:38,540 --> 01:47:39,655
Fuck.

1684
01:47:54,860 --> 01:47:56,452
Are you all right?

1685
01:48:03,260 --> 01:48:05,694
<i>It was revenge for Billy Batts...</i>

1686
01:48:05,780 --> 01:48:07,577
<i>and a lot of other things.</i>

1687
01:48:07,660 --> 01:48:08,695
And that's that.

1688
01:48:08,780 --> 01:48:11,169
<i>There was nothing we could do about it.</i>

1689
01:48:11,340 --> 01:48:13,854
<i>Batts was a made man
and Tommy wasn't.</i>

1690
01:48:14,460 --> 01:48:16,371
<i>We had to sit still and take it.</i>

1691
01:48:16,460 --> 01:48:19,736
<i>It was among the Italians.
It was real greaseball shit.</i>

1692
01:48:31,900 --> 01:48:33,697
<i>They even shot Tommy in the face...</i>

1693
01:48:33,780 --> 01:48:37,136
<i>so his mother couldn't give him
an open coffin at the funeral.</i>

1694
01:49:22,540 --> 01:49:25,896
<i>I was gonna be busy all day.
I had to drop off some guns at Jimmy's...</i>

1695
01:49:25,980 --> 01:49:27,732
<i>to match some silencers he had.</i>

1696
01:49:27,820 --> 01:49:30,778
<i>I had to pick up my brother at the hospital
and drive him home.</i>

1697
01:49:30,860 --> 01:49:33,328
<i>I had to pick up
some new Pittsburgh stuff for Lois...</i>

1698
01:49:33,420 --> 01:49:36,492
<i>to fly down to some customers
I had near Atlanta.</i>

1699
01:49:47,300 --> 01:49:50,690
<i>Right away, I knew he didn't want them,
and I'd be stuck for the money.</i>

1700
01:49:50,780 --> 01:49:54,329
<i>I only bought them because
he wanted them, and now he didn't.</i>

1701
01:49:55,060 --> 01:49:58,450
What good are these? None of them fit.
What's the matter with you?

1702
01:49:58,540 --> 01:49:59,768
I'm not paying for it.

1703
01:49:59,860 --> 01:50:03,375
<i>I didn't say a thing. Jimmy was
so pissed off, he didn't even say goodbye.</i>

1704
01:50:03,460 --> 01:50:05,690
Stop the drugs. They're making
your mind into mush!

1705
01:50:05,780 --> 01:50:07,213
-You hear me?
-I'll take them back.

1706
01:50:20,380 --> 01:50:22,291
<i>My Pittsburgh guys always wanted guns.</i>

1707
01:50:22,380 --> 01:50:25,929
<i>Since I would see them in the afternoon
to pick up a delivery...</i>

1708
01:50:26,020 --> 01:50:28,454
<i>I was pretty sure I'd get my money back.</i>

1709
01:50:46,700 --> 01:50:47,815
Oh, my God.

1710
01:50:49,500 --> 01:50:53,413
<i>When I finally got to the hospital,
Michael's doctor wanted to put me in bed.</i>

1711
01:50:53,500 --> 01:50:55,616
Jesus Christ, what happened to you?

1712
01:50:56,540 --> 01:50:58,849
I almost got into an accident
on the way here.

1713
01:50:58,940 --> 01:51:01,818
<i>And I told him I was partying all night.</i>

1714
01:51:01,900 --> 01:51:03,697
-I'm fine.
-Come on. Get over here.

1715
01:51:03,780 --> 01:51:06,010
-Doc, I'm fine.
-Let me check you out.

1716
01:51:06,300 --> 01:51:07,415
Come on.

1717
01:51:10,300 --> 01:51:12,939
<i>He took mercy on me,
gave me 10 milligrams of Valium...</i>

1718
01:51:13,020 --> 01:51:14,373
<i>and sent me home.</i>

1719
01:51:14,780 --> 01:51:18,329
<i>My plan was to drop off my brother
at the house and pick up Karen.</i>

1720
01:51:20,300 --> 01:51:23,337
There it is.
You see that helicopter right there?

1721
01:51:23,420 --> 01:51:26,810
Right in front of us, there.
I think it's been following me all morning.

1722
01:51:26,900 --> 01:51:29,698
-Get the fuck out. What are you, nuts?
-I'm telling you.

1723
01:51:29,780 --> 01:51:31,008
I don't know what's going on.

1724
01:51:31,100 --> 01:51:34,092
It's the third time I've seen it.
At the hospital I saw it.

1725
01:51:34,180 --> 01:51:36,535
I had to make some stops.
I've seen it every time.

1726
01:51:36,620 --> 01:51:39,373
I've been all over town
and I've seen it all day.

1727
01:51:45,660 --> 01:51:47,173
<i>I was cooking dinner that night.</i>

1728
01:51:48,380 --> 01:51:52,168
<i>I had to start braising the beef
and veal shanks for the tomato sauce.</i>

1729
01:51:54,340 --> 01:51:57,377
<i>It was Michael's favorite.
I was making ziti with meat gravy...</i>

1730
01:51:57,460 --> 01:52:00,054
<i>and I'm planning to roast some peppers
over the flames...</i>

1731
01:52:00,140 --> 01:52:04,019
<i>put on some string beans with olive oil.
I had some beautiful cutlets...</i>

1732
01:52:04,100 --> 01:52:05,169
<i>that were cut just right...</i>

1733
01:52:05,260 --> 01:52:08,172
<i>that I was going to fry up as an appetizer.</i>

1734
01:52:08,380 --> 01:52:10,371
<i>So, I was home for about an hour.</i>

1735
01:52:10,460 --> 01:52:12,371
<i>My plan was to start the dinner early...</i>

1736
01:52:12,460 --> 01:52:15,020
<i>so Karen and I could unload the guns
Jimmy didn't want...</i>

1737
01:52:15,100 --> 01:52:16,499
<i>then get the package for Lois...</i>

1738
01:52:16,580 --> 01:52:19,333
<i>to take to Atlanta for her trip
later that night.</i>

1739
01:52:19,900 --> 01:52:23,688
<i>I kept looking out the window,
and I saw that the helicopter was gone.</i>

1740
01:52:24,100 --> 01:52:27,854
Michael, keep an eye on the sauce.
Stay here with your Uncle Michael.

1741
01:52:28,540 --> 01:52:32,328
<i>So I asked my brother to watch the sauce,
and Karen and I started out.</i>

1742
01:52:34,940 --> 01:52:36,931
Oh, God. I see it.

1743
01:52:37,180 --> 01:52:39,569
-I see it. Look, it's right there.
-Damn!

1744
01:52:40,740 --> 01:52:42,173
-That's it.
-There it is.

1745
01:52:42,260 --> 01:52:44,216
We got to get to your mother's.

1746
01:52:44,420 --> 01:52:45,739
See, I told you.

1747
01:52:45,820 --> 01:52:47,139
It's funny.

1748
01:52:47,540 --> 01:52:50,930
-It's not the end of the world.
-We're going to your mother's.

1749
01:53:17,540 --> 01:53:21,249
Go inside, tell your mother not to touch
anything outside the house. Nothing.

1750
01:53:21,340 --> 01:53:24,093
We couldn't go to your mother's house?
You had to come here.

1751
01:53:29,420 --> 01:53:31,058
Let's go shopping.

1752
01:53:33,060 --> 01:53:35,176
I'm not nuts,
it's been following me all morning.

1753
01:53:36,420 --> 01:53:37,739
I'm telling you.

1754
01:53:38,380 --> 01:53:41,497
Fine. Fine. He thinks I'm paranoid!

1755
01:53:42,540 --> 01:53:46,215
I should bring him the helicopter,
then we'll see how paranoid I am.

1756
01:53:47,740 --> 01:53:49,492
Come on, let's go inside.

1757
01:53:53,420 --> 01:53:55,217
-Yeah, it's gone.
-I don't hear anything.

1758
01:53:55,300 --> 01:53:56,653
Let's go back to your mother's.

1759
01:54:10,020 --> 01:54:12,488
-They all right?
-Beautiful. They're great.

1760
01:54:13,300 --> 01:54:15,894
Didn't I tell you, you were paranoid?
Didn't I tell him?

1761
01:54:15,980 --> 01:54:17,459
Yeah. I need a hit.

1762
01:54:17,980 --> 01:54:21,290
Want to see helicopters?
Come on, I'll show you helicopters.

1763
01:54:21,500 --> 01:54:24,412
I've seen enough helicopters for one day,
thank you.

1764
01:54:24,860 --> 01:54:29,058
<i>I had to get home and get the package
ready for Lois to take on her trip.</i>

1765
01:54:29,140 --> 01:54:32,974
<i>Also, I had to get to Sandy's to give
the package a whack with quinine.</i>

1766
01:54:33,180 --> 01:54:35,410
<i>Plus, I knew Sandy would get on my ass.</i>

1767
01:54:35,500 --> 01:54:39,129
<i>I had the cooking to finish,
and I had to get Lois ready for her trip.</i>

1768
01:54:39,220 --> 01:54:42,132
-It's Sandy. What is this?
-She's a pain in the ass.

1769
01:54:43,340 --> 01:54:45,012
<i>-When are you coming over?
-In an hour.</i>

1770
01:54:45,100 --> 01:54:48,251
<i>-You staying tonight, right?
-I can't. I got my brother tonight.</i>

1771
01:54:48,340 --> 01:54:52,219
Come on, stop.
We'll talk about it later, okay? Goodbye.

1772
01:54:59,540 --> 01:55:01,451
<i>-Hello?
-It's me. You ready?</i>

1773
01:55:02,420 --> 01:55:05,617
Tell Michael not to let the sauce stick.
Keep stirring it.

1774
01:55:05,700 --> 01:55:09,454
-Henry says don't let the sauce stick.
-I'm stirring it.

1775
01:55:09,540 --> 01:55:11,371
<i>-Listen, you know what to do?
-Yeah, yeah.</i>

1776
01:55:11,460 --> 01:55:13,655
Don't "yeah, yeah" me, Lois.
This is important.

1777
01:55:13,740 --> 01:55:16,174
Make sure you leave the house
when you make the call.

1778
01:55:16,260 --> 01:55:19,377
Understand me?
Call from an outside line. I mean it.

1779
01:55:19,460 --> 01:55:23,055
Jesus, you must think I'm dumb. Why
are you bugging me? I know what to do.

1780
01:55:23,140 --> 01:55:25,734
You little hick, just make sure you do it.

1781
01:55:25,820 --> 01:55:26,855
<i>You can be such a pain.</i>

1782
01:55:26,940 --> 01:55:30,694
<i>-Hey! Just do it!
-Okay.</i>

1783
01:55:31,420 --> 01:55:35,777
Un-fucking-believable. All of them.
Every fucking girl in my life.

1784
01:55:37,060 --> 01:55:39,176
-What did he say?
-Nothing.

1785
01:55:39,260 --> 01:55:41,535
<i>What does she do
after she hangs up with me?</i>

1786
01:55:41,620 --> 01:55:45,056
<i>After everything I told her?
After all her "yeah, yeah "bullshit?</i>

1787
01:55:45,140 --> 01:55:47,734
<i>She picks up the phone
and calls from the house.</i>

1788
01:55:47,820 --> 01:55:50,095
<i>If anybody was listening,
they'd know everything.</i>

1789
01:55:50,180 --> 01:55:52,136
<i>They'd know a package
was leaving my house...</i>

1790
01:55:52,220 --> 01:55:55,656
<i>and they'd even have the time and
flight number, thanks to her.</i>

1791
01:55:57,220 --> 01:55:59,097
<i>As soon as I got home, I started cooking.</i>

1792
01:55:59,180 --> 01:56:01,250
<i>I had a few hours until Lois' flight.</i>

1793
01:56:01,340 --> 01:56:03,410
<i>I told my brother to watch the stove.</i>

1794
01:56:03,500 --> 01:56:07,095
<i>All day long the guy's been watching
helicopters and tomato sauce.</i>

1795
01:56:07,900 --> 01:56:12,337
<i>I had to drive over to Sandy's,
mix the stuff, then get back to the gravy.</i>

1796
01:56:23,060 --> 01:56:26,052
Do you think you can come over here,
fuck me, and leave?

1797
01:56:26,140 --> 01:56:28,176
-Come on.
-You got someplace better to go?

1798
01:56:28,260 --> 01:56:30,694
Don't talk like that. Come on.

1799
01:56:31,060 --> 01:56:32,812
-You all right?
-Yeah, sure.

1800
01:56:32,900 --> 01:56:34,128
You believe me?

1801
01:56:35,260 --> 01:56:36,659
Do you believe me?

1802
01:56:36,900 --> 01:56:38,299
Do you believe me?

1803
01:56:40,180 --> 01:56:41,852
-That the last one?
-Yeah.

1804
01:56:51,060 --> 01:56:53,290
You lying son of a bitch. I hate you!

1805
01:56:59,740 --> 01:57:03,449
Please stop feeding the dog
from the table...

1806
01:57:03,540 --> 01:57:05,770
from the plate on top of it. Stop it.

1807
01:57:05,860 --> 01:57:08,169
-I have to.
-You don't have to.

1808
01:57:12,900 --> 01:57:14,299
I got to go home.

1809
01:57:16,260 --> 01:57:18,171
What do you mean, you got to go home?

1810
01:57:18,260 --> 01:57:19,579
I've been carrying this all day.

1811
01:57:19,660 --> 01:57:22,254
We got to start taping it to your leg.
We got to go soon.

1812
01:57:22,340 --> 01:57:24,331
I got to go home and get my hat.

1813
01:57:25,060 --> 01:57:27,574
Forget your fucking hat.
Are you kidding me?

1814
01:57:27,740 --> 01:57:30,459
So I need a trip to Rockaway
because you want your hat?

1815
01:57:30,540 --> 01:57:34,374
I need it, I got to have it.
It's my lucky hat. I never fly without it.

1816
01:57:34,540 --> 01:57:38,374
Lois, do you understand
what we are involved in here?

1817
01:57:38,820 --> 01:57:41,732
I don't care. I need my hat.
I won't fly without it.

1818
01:57:46,460 --> 01:57:49,896
<i>What could I do if she insisted
I drive her home for her goddamn hat?</i>

1819
01:57:49,980 --> 01:57:52,733
<i>I hid the package in the kitchen
and went to take her home.</i>

1820
01:57:52,820 --> 01:57:53,889
A hat?

1821
01:58:02,620 --> 01:58:04,178
What the fuck is this?

1822
01:58:04,340 --> 01:58:06,854
Police! Freeze! Don't you move,
you motherfucker...

1823
01:58:06,940 --> 01:58:09,932
or I'll blow your brains out.
Shut the car off slowly.

1824
01:58:13,700 --> 01:58:15,691
<i>For a second, I thought I was dead.</i>

1825
01:58:15,780 --> 01:58:18,248
<i>But when I heard all the noise,
I knew they were cops.</i>

1826
01:58:18,340 --> 01:58:19,978
<i>Only cops talk that way.</i>

1827
01:58:20,180 --> 01:58:21,329
Don't fucking move.

1828
01:58:21,420 --> 01:58:24,776
<i>If they had been wiseguys,
I wouldn't have heard a thing.</i>

1829
01:58:25,620 --> 01:58:27,258
<i>I would have been dead.</i>

1830
01:58:28,180 --> 01:58:29,818
Michael, lock the door!

1831
01:58:53,060 --> 01:58:55,938
Talk to me. When was the last time
you took a collar?

1832
01:58:56,020 --> 01:58:57,612
Fuckhead, I'm talking to you.

1833
01:58:57,700 --> 01:59:01,295
You don't want to say a fucking word,
don't. I don't really give a fuck.

1834
01:59:01,380 --> 01:59:05,419
You'll do 25 years. See how much
of a good guy you'll be then.

1835
01:59:05,500 --> 01:59:07,536
<i>All day I thought the guys
in the helicopter...</i>

1836
01:59:07,620 --> 01:59:12,057
<i>were local cops busting my balls over
Lufthansa. They turned out to be narcs.</i>

1837
01:59:12,140 --> 01:59:13,209
Just get the lawyer.

1838
01:59:13,300 --> 01:59:16,815
<i>They'd been on me a month.
Phone taps, surveillance, everything.</i>

1839
01:59:16,900 --> 01:59:19,539
You know the boys. All the pals are here.

1840
01:59:19,620 --> 01:59:23,010
You don't want to talk to me,
you'll have a problem all night.

1841
01:59:23,220 --> 01:59:27,008
Each one of these counts holds
25-to-life in New York State.

1842
01:59:27,100 --> 01:59:31,491
Twenty-five fucking years, pal.
I'll slap your fucking head inside out.

1843
01:59:32,220 --> 01:59:34,415
What, were you guys grocery shopping?

1844
01:59:35,740 --> 01:59:39,415
Are we going to make a cake?
You going to make a fucking cake?

1845
01:59:39,660 --> 01:59:41,730
You got anything good in there?

1846
01:59:43,380 --> 01:59:44,495
Is it good?

1847
01:59:49,300 --> 01:59:50,779
Bye-bye, dickhead.

1848
01:59:53,780 --> 01:59:55,179
See you in Attica, dick.

1849
01:59:55,740 --> 01:59:58,812
I spoke to Jimmy.
He offered to give me some money.

1850
01:59:59,260 --> 02:00:02,536
He just wants to know what's happening.
He just wants to talk to you.

1851
02:00:02,620 --> 02:00:04,053
Fuck Jimmy and his money.

1852
02:00:04,140 --> 02:00:07,371
I got to straighten out everything
with Paulie or I'm dead.

1853
02:00:07,980 --> 02:00:09,732
Then you're better off staying in here.

1854
02:00:09,820 --> 02:00:13,290
They could whack me in here as easy
as outside, maybe even easier.

1855
02:00:13,380 --> 02:00:15,052
They're afraid I'll rat them out.

1856
02:00:15,140 --> 02:00:19,292
People are already walking away from me.
I'm dead in here. You got to get me out.

1857
02:00:19,380 --> 02:00:23,851
<i>Karen finally got her mother to put
her house up for my bail and I was out.</i>

1858
02:00:23,940 --> 02:00:27,899
<i>I remember I had this feeling
I would be killed right outside the jail.</i>

1859
02:00:28,300 --> 02:00:31,417
<i>I knew Paulie was still pissed at me,
and he's such a hothead.</i>

1860
02:00:31,500 --> 02:00:33,252
<i>And I was worried about Jimmy.</i>

1861
02:00:33,340 --> 02:00:37,458
<i>See, Jimmy knew if Paulie found out
he was into drug deals with me...</i>

1862
02:00:38,140 --> 02:00:41,052
<i>Paulie would have Jimmy whacked
even before me.</i>

1863
02:00:42,700 --> 02:00:44,258
<i>This is the bad time.</i>

1864
02:00:45,100 --> 02:00:47,250
<i>I didn't feel safe until I got home.</i>

1865
02:00:49,020 --> 02:00:52,695
<i>Now my plan was to stay alive
long enough to sell off the dope...</i>

1866
02:00:52,780 --> 02:00:57,171
<i>the cops never found, then disappear
until I can get things straightened out.</i>

1867
02:00:58,700 --> 02:00:59,769
Fuck!

1868
02:00:59,860 --> 02:01:03,455
-Where's the stuff I left, Karen?
-I flushed it down the toilet.

1869
02:01:05,140 --> 02:01:06,175
You what?

1870
02:01:06,620 --> 02:01:09,180
What was I supposed to do?
They were all over the house.

1871
02:01:09,260 --> 02:01:13,253
That was worth $60,000!
I need that money! That's all we got!

1872
02:01:13,340 --> 02:01:15,979
What was I supposed to do?
They had a search warrant!

1873
02:01:16,060 --> 02:01:20,338
That's all the money we had! I was
depending on that! Why did you do that?

1874
02:01:20,820 --> 02:01:23,573
I had to. They were going to find it!

1875
02:01:23,660 --> 02:01:27,494
-They would have never found it!
-They would have, I swear to you!

1876
02:01:28,860 --> 02:01:30,452
They would've found it!

1877
02:01:31,860 --> 02:01:33,293
Why did you do that?

1878
02:01:33,380 --> 02:01:36,816
-They would have found it.
-Why did you do that, Karen?

1879
02:01:37,980 --> 02:01:39,857
Oh, my God!

1880
02:01:40,300 --> 02:01:43,098
-I had to do it.
-Oh, my God.

1881
02:02:17,780 --> 02:02:19,611
<i>Paulie, I'm really sorry.</i>

1882
02:02:22,180 --> 02:02:24,899
I don't know what else to say.
I know I fucked up.

1883
02:02:24,980 --> 02:02:26,572
Yeah, you fucked up.

1884
02:02:30,100 --> 02:02:31,931
But I'm all right now.

1885
02:02:33,460 --> 02:02:37,692
I can be trusted now. I'm clean.
On my kids, I'm clean.

1886
02:02:37,780 --> 02:02:40,010
You looked in my eyes and lied to me.

1887
02:02:41,140 --> 02:02:43,210
You treated me like a fucking jerk.

1888
02:02:43,780 --> 02:02:45,293
Like I was never nothing to you.

1889
02:02:45,380 --> 02:02:48,133
After what you said,
I couldn't come to you.

1890
02:02:49,220 --> 02:02:51,495
You know, I was ashamed.

1891
02:02:54,420 --> 02:02:56,297
I'm ashamed now.

1892
02:02:59,500 --> 02:03:01,730
But I got nowhere else to go, Paulie.

1893
02:03:04,660 --> 02:03:08,812
You're all I've got.
And I really need your help. I really do.

1894
02:03:14,740 --> 02:03:15,775
Take this.

1895
02:03:30,220 --> 02:03:32,609
And now I've got to turn my back on you.

1896
02:03:42,220 --> 02:03:43,812
<i>$3,200.</i>

1897
02:03:44,380 --> 02:03:48,214
<i>That's what he gave me.
$3,200 for a lifetime.</i>

1898
02:03:49,100 --> 02:03:51,330
<i>It wasn't even enough to pay for the coffin.</i>

1899
02:03:51,420 --> 02:03:53,411
<i>-We got to get out.
-I don't want to run.</i>

1900
02:03:53,500 --> 02:03:57,732
I don't want to. Am I supposed to pick up
and leave everything? Go hiding?

1901
02:03:58,140 --> 02:04:00,608
I don't want to do that.
Is that what you want?

1902
02:04:00,700 --> 02:04:02,770
If we stay around here, we're dead.

1903
02:04:03,500 --> 02:04:05,252
You got it? We're dead.

1904
02:04:05,900 --> 02:04:07,094
They're right.

1905
02:04:07,420 --> 02:04:10,537
You took too much of that stuff.
You're totally paranoid.

1906
02:04:13,620 --> 02:04:15,497
How's he doing? Busting his balls or what?

1907
02:04:15,580 --> 02:04:16,649
He's okay.

1908
02:04:17,740 --> 02:04:19,219
They sobered him up.

1909
02:04:19,420 --> 02:04:21,490
Good. Very good. Glad to hear it.

1910
02:04:25,140 --> 02:04:27,495
You know what kind of questions
they're asking him?

1911
02:04:27,580 --> 02:04:29,138
Jimmy, I don't know.

1912
02:04:30,180 --> 02:04:33,570
I got my mind on so many other things.
I got no money....

1913
02:04:34,100 --> 02:04:36,660
The girls are old enough
to read the newspapers.

1914
02:04:36,740 --> 02:04:38,856
Tell him he's got to call me. Okay?

1915
02:04:39,540 --> 02:04:43,010
As soon as you talk to him,
he's got to call me. It's important.

1916
02:04:43,340 --> 02:04:46,855
He doesn't know I came here to see you.
It's like he's crazy.

1917
02:04:46,940 --> 02:04:49,977
-Take this. It's a couple of thousands.
-Thanks, Jimmy.

1918
02:04:50,140 --> 02:04:52,051
Don't worry, everything will be all right.

1919
02:04:52,140 --> 02:04:55,337
I got some beautiful Dior dresses.
You want to have them?

1920
02:04:55,580 --> 02:04:57,377
Pick out a few for yourself.

1921
02:04:58,140 --> 02:04:59,971
-For my mom.
-Yeah, whatever.

1922
02:05:00,140 --> 02:05:02,779
No. It's over here.
In the store on the corner.

1923
02:05:02,860 --> 02:05:05,328
It's swag, so I got it down on the corner.

1924
02:05:10,900 --> 02:05:12,697
Go ahead, sweetheart, I'll see you.

1925
02:05:12,780 --> 02:05:14,532
-Thanks, Jimmy.
-Don't worry.

1926
02:05:14,620 --> 02:05:17,214
-I'll try.
-Don't forget, he's got to call me.

1927
02:05:19,620 --> 02:05:21,736
-Over here?
-Right down there.

1928
02:05:36,140 --> 02:05:38,096
It's over there, on the corner.

1929
02:05:38,380 --> 02:05:39,608
Right there.

1930
02:06:12,420 --> 02:06:14,536
No, go ahead. It's right in there.

1931
02:06:14,620 --> 02:06:16,611
No, Jimmy. I'm in a hurry!

1932
02:06:16,940 --> 02:06:19,693
My mom's watching the kids!
I got to get home!

1933
02:06:19,780 --> 02:06:21,259
I'll come back later!

1934
02:06:42,780 --> 02:06:44,338
Karen!

1935
02:06:48,660 --> 02:06:49,854
What happened?

1936
02:06:51,020 --> 02:06:52,089
Nothing.

1937
02:06:52,580 --> 02:06:54,650
-What happened?
-I just got scared.

1938
02:06:57,740 --> 02:06:58,934
Got the keys?

1939
02:07:00,540 --> 02:07:04,089
-What happened, Karen?
-I just got scared. It's okay.

1940
02:07:04,180 --> 02:07:05,852
-Are you all right?
-Yeah.

1941
02:07:12,340 --> 02:07:16,731
<i>If you're part of a crew, nobody ever
tells you they're going to kill you.</i>

1942
02:07:17,260 --> 02:07:19,012
<i>It doesn't happen that way.</i>

1943
02:07:19,100 --> 02:07:22,456
<i>There aren't any arguments
or curses like in the movies.</i>

1944
02:07:22,540 --> 02:07:26,533
<i>Your murderers come with smiles.
They come as your friends.</i>

1945
02:07:26,620 --> 02:07:28,611
<i>People who cared for you all your life.</i>

1946
02:07:28,700 --> 02:07:32,932
<i>They always seem to come when you're
weakest and most in need of their help.</i>

1947
02:07:33,260 --> 02:07:36,377
<i>So I met Jimmy in a crowded place
we both knew.</i>

1948
02:07:36,740 --> 02:07:40,574
<i>I got there 15 minutes early,
and Jimmy was already there.</i>

1949
02:07:40,980 --> 02:07:45,212
<i>He took the booth near the window
so he could see everyone who drove up.</i>

1950
02:07:45,540 --> 02:07:47,815
<i>He wanted to make sure I wasn't tailed.</i>

1951
02:07:48,220 --> 02:07:50,973
<i>He was jumpy. He hadn't touched a thing.</i>

1952
02:07:51,980 --> 02:07:54,938
<i>On the surface,
everything was supposed to be fine.</i>

1953
02:07:55,020 --> 02:07:57,329
<i>We were supposed to be discussing
my case.</i>

1954
02:07:57,420 --> 02:08:02,175
<i>But I had a feeling Jimmy was trying
to sense if I'd rat on him to save my neck.</i>

1955
02:08:03,780 --> 02:08:07,329
I been telling you your whole life,
don't talk on the phone.

1956
02:08:07,540 --> 02:08:09,258
Now you understand?

1957
02:08:11,820 --> 02:08:15,210
It's going to be okay.
You got a good chance to beat the case.

1958
02:08:18,060 --> 02:08:22,133
You know that kid from the city
we were talking about? You know?

1959
02:08:24,460 --> 02:08:28,817
The kid turned out to be a rat. As soon as
he got pinched, he ratted on everybody.

1960
02:08:31,180 --> 02:08:33,330
I know where he is. He's hiding now.

1961
02:08:34,860 --> 02:08:36,373
Know what I'm saying?

1962
02:08:40,940 --> 02:08:44,455
Would you have a problem going
with Anthony to take care of that?

1963
02:08:46,940 --> 02:08:48,134
No, not at all.

1964
02:08:49,700 --> 02:08:51,418
That way they got nothing.

1965
02:08:59,700 --> 02:09:02,498
<i>Jimmy had never asked me
to whack somebody before.</i>

1966
02:09:02,780 --> 02:09:06,375
<i>But now he's asking me to go to Florida
and do a hit with Anthony.</i>

1967
02:09:13,540 --> 02:09:17,169
<i>That's when I knew I would never
have come back from Florida alive.</i>

1968
02:09:30,540 --> 02:09:33,737
Whenever you move me,
I asked once and I'll tell you again...

1969
02:09:33,820 --> 02:09:35,890
I don't want to go any place cold.

1970
02:09:36,580 --> 02:09:38,889
You don't have a choice in that matter.

1971
02:09:39,020 --> 02:09:41,454
Come on. Whoever fucking controls it...

1972
02:09:42,220 --> 02:09:44,814
just no place cold. Do that for me.
I'm trying to--

1973
02:09:44,900 --> 02:09:46,652
He's bronchial, that's why.

1974
02:09:46,740 --> 02:09:49,254
If he's legitimately bronchial,
we'll consider that.

1975
02:09:49,340 --> 02:09:51,535
I'd like to go someplace not cold.

1976
02:09:51,620 --> 02:09:55,215
Can I ask you some questions?
What about my parents?

1977
02:09:56,180 --> 02:09:57,295
What about them?

1978
02:09:57,380 --> 02:10:00,258
Am I going to see them?
Am I going to talk to them?

1979
02:10:00,980 --> 02:10:03,494
Don't I have some kind of contact
with them?

1980
02:10:03,940 --> 02:10:04,975
No.

1981
02:10:06,020 --> 02:10:09,217
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
You mean to tell me that...

1982
02:10:09,580 --> 02:10:13,493
God forbid something happens to my
parents, they get sick, I can't see them?

1983
02:10:13,580 --> 02:10:16,458
Maybe something can be worked out
if they're sick...

1984
02:10:16,940 --> 02:10:19,056
if there's extraordinary circumstances--

1985
02:10:19,140 --> 02:10:21,893
I can't do this. I can't do this, Henry.

1986
02:10:22,980 --> 02:10:24,652
I can't leave my parents.

1987
02:10:25,860 --> 02:10:27,976
Excuse me, Karen, I told you before.

1988
02:10:29,180 --> 02:10:32,570
I'm not going to do this
unless you and the kids come with me.

1989
02:10:34,300 --> 02:10:36,018
I can't do it without you.

1990
02:10:36,300 --> 02:10:40,213
So, you do whatever, but...that's it.

1991
02:10:41,700 --> 02:10:44,294
-You need Henry, not me, right?
-That's right.

1992
02:10:44,460 --> 02:10:46,974
Frankly, I don't care
whether you go or not.

1993
02:10:47,100 --> 02:10:50,297
If it'll make him a better witness,
I'd like you to be with him.

1994
02:10:50,380 --> 02:10:52,098
They want Henry, not me.

1995
02:10:52,180 --> 02:10:55,536
Henry'll be in the protection program.
They can't get to him.

1996
02:10:56,020 --> 02:10:59,376
They can only get to him
by getting to you or your kids.

1997
02:10:59,460 --> 02:11:01,849
If he goes into the program,
you're in danger--

1998
02:11:01,940 --> 02:11:04,329
-I don't know anything.
-Don't give me...

1999
02:11:04,420 --> 02:11:05,819
the babe-in-the-woods routine.

2000
02:11:05,900 --> 02:11:10,371
I've listened to those wiretaps,
and I've heard you talk about cocaine.

2001
02:11:10,460 --> 02:11:13,975
<i>Conversation after conversation
you talked to Henry on the phone.</i>

2002
02:11:18,580 --> 02:11:20,616
It doesn't matter.
Whether he goes to jail...

2003
02:11:20,700 --> 02:11:24,010
or stays on the streets and beats the case,
he's a dead man.

2004
02:11:24,580 --> 02:11:26,411
He knows it and you know it.

2005
02:11:27,820 --> 02:11:29,492
What about the kids and school?

2006
02:11:29,580 --> 02:11:32,014
<i>Will they get left back?
I mean, what goes on?</i>

2007
02:11:32,100 --> 02:11:34,455
Go to Wall Street and get real crooks.

2008
02:11:34,580 --> 02:11:36,935
Whoever sold you those suits
had a sense of humor.

2009
02:11:37,140 --> 02:11:40,052
What it comes down to is
we're your only salvation.

2010
02:11:40,860 --> 02:11:44,455
We'll save your life and his life,
and we'll keep you out of jail.

2011
02:11:48,220 --> 02:11:50,814
<i>This morning you told the jury
about your background.</i>

2012
02:11:50,900 --> 02:11:52,891
<i>It was easy for us to disappear.</i>

2013
02:11:53,180 --> 02:11:55,296
<i>My house
was in my mother-in-law's name.</i>

2014
02:11:55,380 --> 02:11:57,336
<i>My cars were registered to my wife.</i>

2015
02:11:57,420 --> 02:12:00,776
<i>My Social Security cards
and driver's licenses were phonies.</i>

2016
02:12:00,900 --> 02:12:03,130
<i>I never voted or paid taxes.</i>

2017
02:12:03,700 --> 02:12:08,057
<i>My birth certificate and arrest sheet was
all you'd ever have to know I was alive.</i>

2018
02:12:08,140 --> 02:12:10,700
-Do you see him here in this courtroom?
-Yes.

2019
02:12:10,980 --> 02:12:13,494
Will you please point him out for the jury?

2020
02:12:15,780 --> 02:12:20,217
Let the record reflect that Mr. Hill
identified the defendant, James Conway.

2021
02:12:21,300 --> 02:12:24,258
Do you also know a man
named Paul Cicero?

2022
02:12:24,580 --> 02:12:26,855
-Do you see him in the courtroom?
-Yes.

2023
02:12:27,060 --> 02:12:29,176
Can you point him out for the jury?

2024
02:12:30,780 --> 02:12:34,819
Let the record reflect that Mr. Hill
identified the defendant, Paul Cicero.

2025
02:12:35,980 --> 02:12:37,698
Your Honor, I have a document....

2026
02:12:37,780 --> 02:12:40,089
<i>The hardest thing was leaving the life.</i>

2027
02:12:40,820 --> 02:12:42,378
<i>I still love the life.</i>

2028
02:12:42,660 --> 02:12:44,730
<i>We were treated like movie stars
with muscle.</i>

2029
02:12:44,820 --> 02:12:46,890
<i>We had it all, just for the asking.</i>

2030
02:12:46,980 --> 02:12:50,177
<i>Our wives, mothers, kids,
everybody rode along.</i>

2031
02:12:50,500 --> 02:12:53,572
<i>I had paper bags filled with jewelry
stashed in the kitchen.</i>

2032
02:12:53,660 --> 02:12:55,935
<i>I had a sugar bowl full of coke
next to the bed.</i>

2033
02:12:56,020 --> 02:12:59,729
People call them rats because rats do
anything to survive. Isn't that right?

2034
02:12:59,820 --> 02:13:01,856
-Objection!
-Objection sustained.

2035
02:13:01,940 --> 02:13:04,977
-I know nothing about being a rat.
-You know everything about it.

2036
02:13:05,780 --> 02:13:07,293
Objection, Your Honor.
In view of the violence....

2037
02:13:07,380 --> 02:13:09,575
<i>Anything I wanted was a phone call away.</i>

2038
02:13:09,660 --> 02:13:13,050
<i>Free cars. Keys to a dozen hideout flats
all over the city.</i>

2039
02:13:13,140 --> 02:13:15,608
<i>I'd bet $20,000, $30,000 over a weekend...</i>

2040
02:13:15,700 --> 02:13:19,693
<i>then blow the winnings in a week
or go to the sharks to pay the bookies.</i>

2041
02:13:19,860 --> 02:13:21,213
It didn't matter.

2042
02:13:21,540 --> 02:13:26,216
It didn't mean anything. When I was broke
I would go out and rob some more.

2043
02:13:26,620 --> 02:13:28,019
We ran everything.

2044
02:13:28,460 --> 02:13:32,578
We paid off cops. We paid off lawyers.
We paid off judges.

2045
02:13:32,820 --> 02:13:36,176
Everybody had their hands out.
Everything was for the taking.

2046
02:13:38,140 --> 02:13:39,698
And now it's all over.

2047
02:13:40,460 --> 02:13:42,098
<i>That's the hardest part.</i>

2048
02:13:42,820 --> 02:13:44,412
<i>Today everything is different.</i>

2049
02:13:44,500 --> 02:13:48,539
<i>There's no action.
I have to wait around like everyone else.</i>

2050
02:13:48,900 --> 02:13:50,618
<i>Can't even get decent food.</i>

2051
02:13:51,340 --> 02:13:54,412
<i>After I got here I ordered spaghetti
with marinara sauce...</i>

2052
02:13:54,500 --> 02:13:56,570
<i>and I got egg noodles and ketchup.</i>

2053
02:13:57,060 --> 02:13:58,618
<i>I'm an average nobody.</i>

2054
02:13:59,820 --> 02:14:02,573
<i>I get to live the rest of my life
like a schnook.</i>
