1
00:04:06,696 --> 00:04:09,032
It has to be from downtown.

2
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:13,787
It's handled through this office,
but it requires downtown approval.

3
00:04:17,124 --> 00:04:18,375
I don't know.

4
00:04:21,795 --> 00:04:23,505
It has been submitted.

5
00:04:55,954 --> 00:04:58,290
Sylvia, can you help me with this?

6
00:04:58,874 --> 00:04:59,958
Coming.

7
00:05:17,518 --> 00:05:19,187
Closing time. Going in?

8
00:05:20,313 --> 00:05:23,191
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

9
00:05:28,404 --> 00:05:30,198
I couldn't say.

10
00:05:33,659 --> 00:05:35,953
- You the manager?
- It's a matter of policy.

11
00:05:38,457 --> 00:05:40,167
It... It looks...

12
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:42,878
Keep talking like nothing was wrong.

13
00:05:43,754 --> 00:05:47,049
Listen, let me call you back.

14
00:05:53,389 --> 00:05:55,807
Sonny, I'm getting really bad vibes.

15
00:05:57,934 --> 00:05:59,727
What are you talking about?

16
00:06:00,561 --> 00:06:03,272
Maybe we should take
something smaller, Sonny.

17
00:06:05,441 --> 00:06:09,070
You crazy? He started already.
He's got the gun out.

18
00:06:10,071 --> 00:06:11,989
Go on, go over by the door.

19
00:06:15,244 --> 00:06:16,870
Get over by the door.

20
00:07:07,172 --> 00:07:08,297
Freeze!

21
00:07:08,464 --> 00:07:10,340
- Nobody move.
- Get over there!

22
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,386
Okay. All right,
get away from those alarms.

23
00:07:14,887 --> 00:07:16,555
Come on, get in the center.

24
00:07:18,432 --> 00:07:20,350
He moves, take his head off.

25
00:07:20,517 --> 00:07:22,603
Put the gun on him!
Get out of the center.

26
00:07:23,312 --> 00:07:25,022
Sonny.

27
00:07:25,482 --> 00:07:27,067
I can't do it, Sonny.

28
00:07:28,485 --> 00:07:31,362
- What?
- I'm not gonna make it.

29
00:07:33,073 --> 00:07:36,201
- What? Put it on him.
- I can't do it, Sonny.

30
00:07:36,368 --> 00:07:38,536
Oh, fuck me. Sal.

31
00:07:40,705 --> 00:07:43,458
- What?
- Where are you? He can't make it.

32
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:44,834
Fuck him. Let him go!

33
00:07:46,336 --> 00:07:47,921
Come on, Sonny!

34
00:07:49,547 --> 00:07:51,549
All right, let him out.

35
00:07:51,716 --> 00:07:54,135
- Let him out!
- Do what the gentleman says, Howard.

36
00:07:54,469 --> 00:07:55,929
Let him out!

37
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,433
I'm sorry, Sonny.

38
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,436
Oh, shit.

39
00:08:03,437 --> 00:08:06,107
- Stevie, don't take the car.
- How do I get home?

40
00:08:08,192 --> 00:08:09,777
Take the subway. We need the car.

41
00:08:10,152 --> 00:08:12,571
Stevie, the keys.

42
00:08:14,573 --> 00:08:16,325
- I'm sorry, Sonny.
- Right.

43
00:08:16,575 --> 00:08:17,952
All right, lock it.

44
00:08:18,119 --> 00:08:19,453
Shit.

45
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:28,044
- What do you want?
- Sonny, there's a girl under that desk.

46
00:08:36,845 --> 00:08:37,888
All right, go.

47
00:08:41,892 --> 00:08:44,520
We got rid of him.
So now we just move it along.

48
00:08:44,687 --> 00:08:46,355
- Sal, you got them?
- I got them.

49
00:08:46,564 --> 00:08:49,400
Okay. What'd he say to me?
Wait a minute.

50
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:51,652
Anybody here?
What's this, a squirrel?

51
00:08:51,902 --> 00:08:54,739
Hey, you. Come on. Go ahead.

52
00:08:54,905 --> 00:08:57,575
In the back there.
No one's gonna hurt you.

53
00:08:58,159 --> 00:08:59,744
Go ahead, get to the back.

54
00:08:59,994 --> 00:09:02,788
- Pull the drapes!
- Howard.

55
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:09,128
Now, you, to the back there.

56
00:09:09,378 --> 00:09:11,088
Go to him, right there.

57
00:09:11,255 --> 00:09:15,302
Okay. We're gonna move this now.
Just moving along.

58
00:09:15,469 --> 00:09:18,555
Come on. Gotcha. Gotcha.

59
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:23,268
We're moving right along, folks. Gonna
get this thing done in half an hour.

60
00:09:23,894 --> 00:09:25,479
We just gotta block...

61
00:09:25,729 --> 00:09:27,481
Oh, shit.

62
00:09:27,647 --> 00:09:28,982
Here.

63
00:09:30,442 --> 00:09:33,486
Knock out the TV.
There we go.

64
00:09:34,111 --> 00:09:37,406
See? No replay, folks.
No alarms.

65
00:09:37,698 --> 00:09:39,784
Let's get you all fixed up
and on your way.

66
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:42,578
- Right. Is the vault open?
- I can take care of that.

67
00:09:42,745 --> 00:09:44,872
That's good. Let's go.
Take care of it.

68
00:09:48,334 --> 00:09:50,796
Hey, wait a minute.
What are you trying to do?

69
00:09:51,046 --> 00:09:54,007
Trip the alarm?
Use the spot key?

70
00:09:55,384 --> 00:09:58,136
- I must've been out of my mind.
- You get your mind right!

71
00:09:58,553 --> 00:10:01,306
I'm a Catholic. I don't wanna
hurt anybody, understand?

72
00:10:01,473 --> 00:10:03,350
- Yes, sir.
- No alarms.

73
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,185
- No alarms!
- Okay.

74
00:10:05,352 --> 00:10:07,062
No games, all right?

75
00:10:08,772 --> 00:10:09,815
Use the other one.

76
00:10:11,108 --> 00:10:12,275
Miriam...

77
00:10:12,609 --> 00:10:14,027
...open the safe.

78
00:10:15,237 --> 00:10:18,115
It's all right. It's all right.

79
00:10:31,379 --> 00:10:33,631
Here. Put it in this.

80
00:10:48,895 --> 00:10:50,272
What?

81
00:10:50,939 --> 00:10:52,816
That's all there is.

82
00:10:55,736 --> 00:10:57,070
What are you talking about?

83
00:10:57,237 --> 00:10:59,906
They picked it up today.
There's only $ 1,100.

84
00:11:00,198 --> 00:11:03,035
- It's true.
- He's gonna shoot me.

85
00:11:04,203 --> 00:11:06,122
I can't believe it.

86
00:11:06,873 --> 00:11:08,958
I can't believe it.

87
00:11:10,543 --> 00:11:11,878
There's no money here.

88
00:11:12,045 --> 00:11:15,548
- Come on, Sonny, let's do it!
- I'm doing it!

89
00:11:17,258 --> 00:11:21,679
Too much. This is too much.
This is too much.

90
00:11:22,388 --> 00:11:24,223
All right, come on. Let's go.

91
00:11:25,641 --> 00:11:27,602
Somebody... You answer it.

92
00:11:27,769 --> 00:11:31,189
Watch him, Sal. You, come with me.
Watch him.

93
00:11:32,565 --> 00:11:35,443
- Sit down.
- Who's the head teller here?

94
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:37,320
- I am.
- Come here.

95
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:43,744
All right, open it up.

96
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,499
Nope, not all of it.

97
00:11:48,665 --> 00:11:51,835
Look, I worked in a bank.
I know the alarms. All right?

98
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:53,837
Don't play games with me. See.

99
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:56,090
You take one of these,
go like this...

100
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,965
...in here, and out it comes.

101
00:11:58,216 --> 00:11:59,384
You got your 100.

102
00:11:59,926 --> 00:12:01,469
I'll call you back.

103
00:12:03,471 --> 00:12:05,723
No, it's decoy money.
It's marked.

104
00:12:06,349 --> 00:12:07,642
It's shit.

105
00:12:07,892 --> 00:12:09,185
See?

106
00:12:12,522 --> 00:12:14,942
Cheer up, you'll be
the veterans of a robbery.

107
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:17,903
You know the bank
sends you a dozen red roses?

108
00:12:18,153 --> 00:12:20,864
Sal, let him answer it.

109
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:25,577
Hey, you. Manager. Fucker!
Don't get ideas.

110
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:27,746
I bark, that man there, he bites.

111
00:12:27,996 --> 00:12:30,541
- Believe me, I'm on your side.
- On my side, shit.

112
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:34,211
Listen, we got young girls here.
You could watch your language.

113
00:12:38,006 --> 00:12:39,925
I speak what I feel.

114
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:43,595
"Watch my language."
Empty the drawer out.

115
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,349
I don't know.
You'd have to find out from him.

116
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,435
Traveler's checks...

117
00:12:51,146 --> 00:12:52,188
...and the register.

118
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:55,358
The register.

119
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:59,779
You've got it.
All right, let's go.

120
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:03,158
I'll take that from you.

121
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:06,286
All right, Sal, here we go.

122
00:13:08,912 --> 00:13:10,539
Shit.

123
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:21,717
Come on.

124
00:13:25,929 --> 00:13:28,683
- Shit.
- Sonny, what the hell are you doing?

125
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:31,102
I'm burning the register here.

126
00:13:34,856 --> 00:13:36,775
Moving right along, folks.

127
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:39,778
All right. Okay.

128
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:43,531
We're leaving.
Let me have the keys.

129
00:13:44,074 --> 00:13:45,408
Howard, give him the keys.

130
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:49,204
- Come on.
- Howard.

131
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:51,998
Nobody's gonna hurt you.
We're gonna leave.

132
00:13:57,045 --> 00:13:59,839
Sonny. Who's that?

133
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:03,761
It's the insurance guy from across
the street. He probably saw the smoke.

134
00:14:12,853 --> 00:14:15,231
Please, put out the fire.

135
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,578
- I'll get some water.
- Stay right there!

136
00:14:30,745 --> 00:14:33,832
No, no, please, don't...! Don't do it!

137
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:36,918
- I'm call you back later.
- Get rid of him.

138
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,630
- Come on, get rid of him!
- Howard.

139
00:14:40,589 --> 00:14:41,924
Howard.

140
00:14:49,098 --> 00:14:50,891
- Use your head.
- I can handle it.

141
00:14:58,441 --> 00:15:01,819
- Everything's all right?
- Cigarette butt got in the wastebasket.

142
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:07,575
- Well, then you're okay.
- Yeah. Thanks for keeping an eye out.

143
00:15:07,742 --> 00:15:09,326
Okay.

144
00:15:13,414 --> 00:15:15,417
- Good.
- Go now. We gave you all we've got.

145
00:15:15,584 --> 00:15:17,377
Okay, we're going.

146
00:15:17,586 --> 00:15:20,172
Answer the phone.
Sal, get them in the vault.

147
00:15:20,338 --> 00:15:21,798
Come on, in the vault.

148
00:15:21,965 --> 00:15:24,217
- Where's the money?
- I'm getting it. Got it.

149
00:15:30,932 --> 00:15:33,893
He's gonna come with us. Okay.

150
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:36,979
No, please don't close that door.
How can we breathe?

151
00:15:37,146 --> 00:15:38,856
- I can't explain. I'll call...
- Right.

152
00:15:39,356 --> 00:15:40,900
Wait a minute.

153
00:15:41,108 --> 00:15:42,693
- Wait a minute. Listen.
- What?

154
00:15:42,902 --> 00:15:45,613
I will never make this.
I'll have to go to the toilet.

155
00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:49,909
Honey, it's no joke.

156
00:15:50,117 --> 00:15:53,205
I got a terrible fear
of being locked in.

157
00:15:57,417 --> 00:16:00,337
- Who has to go to the bathroom?
- I do too.

158
00:16:00,587 --> 00:16:04,341
- See, now they all wanna go.
- Look, do you wanna check it out?

159
00:16:04,508 --> 00:16:07,469
It's the first door on your right.

160
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:12,307
All right, Mouth, let's go.

161
00:16:14,518 --> 00:16:16,686
First door on my right.

162
00:16:17,604 --> 00:16:18,647
It's Maria!

163
00:16:19,314 --> 00:16:22,901
Listen, I... I forgot she's in there.
It's not her fault.

164
00:16:23,068 --> 00:16:25,862
She's always pulling this.
She's supposed to have 10 minutes...

165
00:16:26,029 --> 00:16:29,367
...she takes 15...
- Shut up! Nobody goes to the bathroom.

166
00:16:29,534 --> 00:16:32,495
- Let's go, out.
- We're having a bank robbery.

167
00:16:34,497 --> 00:16:36,332
Mulvaney speaking.

168
00:16:36,499 --> 00:16:38,167
All right, Mouth. Mouth.

169
00:16:38,418 --> 00:16:40,253
- Here's your toilet.
- It's for you.

170
00:16:40,503 --> 00:16:42,797
- What?
- Telephone call.

171
00:16:44,674 --> 00:16:46,007
For you.

172
00:17:07,405 --> 00:17:08,448
Yeah.

173
00:17:08,614 --> 00:17:10,658
<i>- What are you doing in there?
- Who's this?</i>

174
00:17:10,908 --> 00:17:15,913
<i>Detective Sergeant Eugene Moretti,
asshole. We got you by the balls.</i>

175
00:17:16,164 --> 00:17:19,709
<i>I'm looking you right in the eye.
Right now I can see you.</i>

176
00:17:19,876 --> 00:17:20,960
- Who is it?
- Cops.

177
00:17:42,941 --> 00:17:44,526
You come to the front door...

178
00:17:45,027 --> 00:17:46,320
Hang it up.

179
00:18:08,883 --> 00:18:10,426
Get on the side of the street.

180
00:18:10,593 --> 00:18:11,928
Come on, let's go.

181
00:18:13,846 --> 00:18:15,473
How'd that happen?

182
00:18:16,767 --> 00:18:19,686
Did I do anything to hurt you?
Did I treat you badly?

183
00:18:19,937 --> 00:18:23,982
- Look at my salary. I won't be a hero.
- Did you have a plan or what?

184
00:18:24,233 --> 00:18:26,193
What did you do,
just barge in on a whim?

185
00:18:27,069 --> 00:18:29,905
- Why'd you have to light a fire?
- I told you to get out...

186
00:18:30,155 --> 00:18:32,324
...when you could,
but you had to hang around.

187
00:18:32,491 --> 00:18:34,535
He don't have a plan.
It's all a whim.

188
00:18:34,701 --> 00:18:37,246
- Rob a bank, right?
- I had it planned!

189
00:18:37,496 --> 00:18:40,332
Only the money should have
been delivered, not taken away.

190
00:18:40,499 --> 00:18:44,461
That fucking Jack, downtown, he gave
me the wrong information. That fuck!

191
00:18:44,712 --> 00:18:47,965
What is this Jack supposed to be?
A mastermind or what?

192
00:18:48,132 --> 00:18:49,591
I wouldn't be arguing with me.

193
00:18:49,758 --> 00:18:53,138
We're all in a barrel together
and we wanna get out of it.

194
00:18:56,266 --> 00:18:59,894
All right, I gotta have time to think.
I gotta think.

195
00:19:00,145 --> 00:19:01,479
Oh, shit.

196
00:19:18,203 --> 00:19:21,582
Listen, bastards. You keep away,
or we'll start throwing bodies out...

197
00:19:21,749 --> 00:19:23,250
...one at a time. Got that?

198
00:19:26,795 --> 00:19:28,548
Who is this?

199
00:19:38,266 --> 00:19:40,477
There a Jenny here?

200
00:19:40,643 --> 00:19:44,022
- Who's Jenny here?
- That's me.

201
00:19:44,272 --> 00:19:46,566
It's the squirrel.
You got a husband?

202
00:19:47,233 --> 00:19:50,570
Yeah? Well, he's on the phone.
Go ahead.

203
00:19:51,529 --> 00:19:53,782
Well, what could I tell him?

204
00:19:54,365 --> 00:19:56,868
I don't know, tell him whatever.
Tell him the truth.

205
00:19:57,077 --> 00:20:00,121
What a fucking comedy.
W-N-E-W, plays all the hits.

206
00:20:00,371 --> 00:20:01,915
<i>Listen. Now, don 't hang up.</i>

207
00:20:02,665 --> 00:20:05,002
<i>- First off, is anybody hurt in there?
- No.</i>

208
00:20:05,252 --> 00:20:09,173
Keep away, or we'll start throwing
bodies out, one at a time. You got that?

209
00:20:09,423 --> 00:20:12,927
Don't do that. Let me talk to you for
a while. How many people you got?

210
00:20:13,094 --> 00:20:14,345
<i>No, call me back.</i>

211
00:20:14,678 --> 00:20:16,764
- Call me back.
- Excuse me.

212
00:20:18,182 --> 00:20:21,268
He said he wants to know
what time you'll be through.

213
00:20:21,852 --> 00:20:23,895
What? Oh, girlie, please.

214
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,114
Come on. Let's go.

215
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:43,582
- Where's the back door?
- It's locked on the inside.

216
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:45,126
Where is it?

217
00:20:45,376 --> 00:20:47,503
Through the passageway to the right.

218
00:20:49,296 --> 00:20:52,466
Sal, cover them, cover them.

219
00:20:52,842 --> 00:20:55,886
You could just go ahead
and cook whatever's there.

220
00:21:01,892 --> 00:21:05,563
<i>Ready for riot gang.
3- 4, sergeant.</i>

221
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:07,940
<i>3- 4, sergeant. Is that roof...?</i>

222
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:27,085
<i>- Negative.
- Tell units preset.</i>

223
00:21:27,377 --> 00:21:30,881
Oh, yes, I will. Yes, I will.

224
00:21:31,048 --> 00:21:34,092
- Let's go, come on.
- Honey, I've gotta go now.

225
00:21:34,676 --> 00:21:36,218
I gotta go.

226
00:21:37,136 --> 00:21:38,637
I love you too.

227
00:21:39,472 --> 00:21:41,766
All right, inside here.

228
00:21:44,226 --> 00:21:47,980
Sal, I don't know what happened.

229
00:21:48,272 --> 00:21:51,400
Maybe somebody tripped an alarm
or something. I don't know.

230
00:21:51,567 --> 00:21:53,987
- But there's a way out of this.
- Listen.

231
00:21:54,154 --> 00:21:57,365
- Were you serious about what you said?
- About what?

232
00:21:58,116 --> 00:22:00,202
About throwing...

233
00:22:02,996 --> 00:22:05,957
About throwing those bodies
out the door?

234
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:12,255
- That's what I want him to think.
- I wanna know what you think.

235
00:22:17,094 --> 00:22:20,389
Because I'll tell you right now,
I'm ready to do it.

236
00:22:20,972 --> 00:22:22,724
Right. Okay.

237
00:22:23,558 --> 00:22:26,228
- I mean it. I mean it.
- I know.

238
00:22:28,271 --> 00:22:29,315
All right.

239
00:22:29,607 --> 00:22:32,360
Listen, everybody.
I know we got a problem here, right?

240
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:35,363
But there's a way out of this thing.
I'm telling you.

241
00:22:35,613 --> 00:22:38,199
All you gotta do is cooperate with me.

242
00:22:38,449 --> 00:22:40,827
Stay cool, and we'll get out of this,
all right?

243
00:22:41,077 --> 00:22:43,079
Nobody gets hurt if you listen to me.

244
00:22:43,413 --> 00:22:47,457
First, we'll do things a step at a time.
You gotta go to the bathroom, right?

245
00:22:47,708 --> 00:22:49,376
She'll get to go to the bathroom.

246
00:22:49,543 --> 00:22:52,212
Everybody who has to go
will get to go to the bathroom.

247
00:22:52,379 --> 00:22:53,672
We'll do things together.

248
00:22:54,381 --> 00:22:56,675
Now, stay cool...
What's the matter with him?

249
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:59,761
He's got asthma.

250
00:23:00,345 --> 00:23:03,306
- Asthma?
- Yeah, asthma.

251
00:23:12,275 --> 00:23:14,694
Asthma. Shit.

252
00:23:16,028 --> 00:23:17,947
All right, I'll take care of that.

253
00:23:18,531 --> 00:23:20,158
- You, what's your name?
- Mulvaney.

254
00:23:20,324 --> 00:23:22,368
Mulvaney? Come with me.

255
00:23:24,203 --> 00:23:27,206
- He's got asthma and he's a guard?
- They go to guard school.

256
00:23:27,415 --> 00:23:30,001
To learn what, how to shoot?
He doesn't have a gun.

257
00:23:30,168 --> 00:23:33,212
They earn a $ 105 a week
to fold the flag in the morning...

258
00:23:33,463 --> 00:23:35,673
...straighten up.
I don't know what they learn.

259
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:40,386
All right, I wanna block that door. In
case they try coming in, I can hear it.

260
00:23:40,636 --> 00:23:42,181
All right. Let's move this.

261
00:23:46,643 --> 00:23:48,687
Wait a minute. Hold it, hold it.

262
00:23:50,647 --> 00:23:52,274
Let's get rid of this.

263
00:23:58,030 --> 00:23:59,364
You got kids?

264
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:02,033
I got 2 kids and I'd like
to see them again.

265
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,911
You'll see them again.
You're being cooperative with me.

266
00:24:05,078 --> 00:24:08,039
I got no complaints
against you, whatsoever.

267
00:24:08,456 --> 00:24:11,167
Whatsoever.
You got bank insurance?

268
00:24:11,334 --> 00:24:14,962
You know I do. You seem
to know a lot about bank procedure.

269
00:24:16,589 --> 00:24:18,592
I know a lot about a lot of things.

270
00:24:21,637 --> 00:24:24,765
I just wanna get you
out of here safe, right?

271
00:24:26,517 --> 00:24:28,477
What if I take you with me?

272
00:24:28,644 --> 00:24:30,145
If you take anybody...

273
00:24:30,396 --> 00:24:32,314
...please take me.

274
00:24:32,606 --> 00:24:34,233
They'll shoot you, you know?

275
00:24:34,483 --> 00:24:35,734
The cops...

276
00:24:35,984 --> 00:24:39,863
...don't care about bank insurance.
See what they did in Attica?

277
00:24:40,322 --> 00:24:44,368
Forty-two people, they killed.
The innocent with the guilty.

278
00:24:45,661 --> 00:24:47,121
Anyway...

279
00:24:49,873 --> 00:24:54,421
I won't take you. I'll take one of
them girls, a married one with kids.

280
00:24:54,671 --> 00:24:58,633
Cops don't like it in the papers when
they shoot a married woman with kids.

281
00:25:02,637 --> 00:25:04,264
You're all right.

282
00:25:05,223 --> 00:25:07,392
You won't fuck with me, will you?

283
00:25:23,699 --> 00:25:25,451
Come on, set a car.

284
00:25:25,868 --> 00:25:28,203
- Help with those barricades.
- Move them back.

285
00:25:36,755 --> 00:25:38,131
There's the FBI.

286
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:43,803
How you doing, Sheldon?

287
00:26:05,742 --> 00:26:08,621
Why didn't you wait
and try to take them outside?

288
00:26:08,954 --> 00:26:10,289
I made an error in judgment.

289
00:26:10,498 --> 00:26:13,918
Thought the S.O.B. S would be
remorseful at the sight of a policeman.

290
00:26:14,168 --> 00:26:17,838
And you know something?
Nobody said "hostage" yet, understand?

291
00:26:21,217 --> 00:26:23,302
- We have a bank robbery here.
- Yeah.

292
00:26:26,054 --> 00:26:28,640
How did the press guys
get through the barrier?

293
00:26:34,896 --> 00:26:38,233
We don't know what's up yet.
We're setting up communications.

294
00:26:38,483 --> 00:26:41,778
This is Ron Cummins from CBS.
Can you tell me the situation?

295
00:26:41,945 --> 00:26:45,366
We got the... We're setting up
communications now.

296
00:26:45,533 --> 00:26:47,243
The perpetrators are in the bank.

297
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:48,786
That's all I can say now.

298
00:26:49,036 --> 00:26:52,790
When I get it, you'll get it.
That's all. Okay.

299
00:26:53,207 --> 00:26:55,209
What are you doing
on the fire escape?

300
00:26:55,459 --> 00:26:58,921
I said on the roof.
Now, get up on the roof, will you?

301
00:27:47,595 --> 00:27:49,930
- Get the phone company?
- It's being set up now.

302
00:27:50,181 --> 00:27:52,933
This phone is gonna be
a direct line into the bank.

303
00:27:58,774 --> 00:28:02,319
<i>- Mulvaney speaking.
- Moretti here. Let me talk to him.</i>

304
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:08,325
<i>- Yeah.
- Detective Sergeant Eugene Moretti.</i>

305
00:28:08,492 --> 00:28:10,368
- Yeah.
- Okay...

306
00:28:10,535 --> 00:28:13,038
...you're in there, we're out here.
What do we do?

307
00:28:13,205 --> 00:28:15,290
<i>- I don't know. What do we do?
- Listen.</i>

308
00:28:15,707 --> 00:28:19,211
- Are the people in the bank okay?
- They're okay.

309
00:28:19,503 --> 00:28:23,006
<i>- You alone or you got confederates?
- I'm not alone.</i>

310
00:28:24,925 --> 00:28:27,677
- I got Sal.
- Sal, what's that for, Salvatore?

311
00:28:27,844 --> 00:28:30,389
Yeah. Sal, he's a killer.

312
00:28:30,556 --> 00:28:33,768
We're Vietnam veterans
so killing don't mean anything to us.

313
00:28:34,018 --> 00:28:35,645
<i>- In the Army?
- In the Army, yeah.</i>

314
00:28:35,978 --> 00:28:40,358
- So there's you, what's your name?
- Why do you wanna know my name?

315
00:28:41,192 --> 00:28:44,028
Give me any name.
Just so I got something to call you.

316
00:28:51,368 --> 00:28:54,996
Let's be reasonable, okay?
Just give me your name.

317
00:28:56,706 --> 00:28:57,749
Call me Sonny.

318
00:28:57,916 --> 00:28:59,251
<i>- Sonny?
- Yeah.</i>

319
00:28:59,418 --> 00:29:01,002
Okay. Now listen, Sonny.

320
00:29:01,253 --> 00:29:03,171
I wanna see
if the people are okay.

321
00:29:03,422 --> 00:29:04,840
<i>- Right.
- Yeah.</i>

322
00:29:05,006 --> 00:29:07,635
Then I wanna work out a way
to get them out of there.

323
00:29:07,802 --> 00:29:09,762
I wanna come over without a gun.

324
00:29:10,012 --> 00:29:13,224
You can frisk me so you can trust me.
We'll find a way out of this.

325
00:29:13,391 --> 00:29:14,517
Right.

326
00:29:14,684 --> 00:29:18,938
I just wanna find some way
that I can trust you too.

327
00:29:19,188 --> 00:29:21,649
Not be on the street
where you could just shoot me.

328
00:29:21,941 --> 00:29:24,318
<i>- Some sign, right?
- Right. Like what?</i>

329
00:29:24,694 --> 00:29:26,362
How about letting the people out?

330
00:29:26,612 --> 00:29:30,324
Come on, now. Who do you think you're
dealing with? A fucking idiot here?

331
00:29:30,575 --> 00:29:32,910
They're keeping me alive.
I'm gonna let them out?

332
00:29:33,077 --> 00:29:35,747
Talk to me. Just talk to me straight.
I'm ready to talk.

333
00:29:35,913 --> 00:29:38,750
Okay, okay.
How about giving us the women?

334
00:29:39,041 --> 00:29:41,335
No, I've got women.
That's all I've got here.

335
00:29:41,502 --> 00:29:44,048
Okay. Give me something.
Give me one of them.

336
00:29:44,214 --> 00:29:46,550
<i>- Why do you want one?
- It's like a fair exchange.</i>

337
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,927
<i>- I'll come over. I won't pack nothing.
- Yeah?</i>

338
00:29:49,094 --> 00:29:52,264
I don't know if you'll take me hostage.
It's a sign of trust.

339
00:29:52,514 --> 00:29:55,684
<i>- How do I call you back?
- We got a direct line here.</i>

340
00:29:55,976 --> 00:29:57,895
Pick up the receiver and I'm here.

341
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:01,481
He wants one.

342
00:30:05,485 --> 00:30:07,862
- Him, right?
- Right.

343
00:30:08,529 --> 00:30:09,572
- Right?
- Right.

344
00:30:09,739 --> 00:30:12,617
- Okay? He goes.
- Okay.

345
00:30:12,784 --> 00:30:14,327
Can you get up?

346
00:30:17,246 --> 00:30:19,333
What are we dealing with here?

347
00:30:21,251 --> 00:30:23,837
Hey, you have to keep
checking me out all the time?

348
00:30:24,463 --> 00:30:25,672
Yeah.

349
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:29,426
- Here you are. Your stomach okay?
- It's all right.

350
00:30:30,761 --> 00:30:32,346
He'll need the keys.

351
00:30:33,013 --> 00:30:34,223
Got the keys?

352
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,894
- Just the one, Sonny!
- Right.

353
00:30:52,658 --> 00:30:56,204
- Hey, don't fire! Don't fire!
- What are you doing?

354
00:30:56,371 --> 00:30:58,665
- Get away from him!
- That's a hostage!

355
00:31:00,542 --> 00:31:03,712
<i>- Don 't fire, don 't fire. Hold your fire.
- Hold your fire!</i>

356
00:31:03,878 --> 00:31:05,755
We voted to send him out!

357
00:31:06,881 --> 00:31:09,426
- He's one of the hostages!
- Get away from him!

358
00:31:09,592 --> 00:31:12,137
- What's the matter with you?
- He's a hostage!

359
00:31:12,303 --> 00:31:15,806
He's one of the hostages.
What the hell's the matter with you?

360
00:31:16,056 --> 00:31:19,560
I don't give a fuck, goddamn it!
Get away. Get out of here.

361
00:31:20,811 --> 00:31:22,688
Hey, Sonny! Wait a minute, Sonny.

362
00:31:22,938 --> 00:31:25,274
That was your fault, Sonny.

363
00:31:25,441 --> 00:31:28,068
You know we had
the communications set up here.

364
00:31:28,235 --> 00:31:31,197
We're not set up properly.
We've got 250 cops here.

365
00:31:31,364 --> 00:31:33,199
We don't know
what's going on in there.

366
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:36,578
- You almost killed him! Are you crazy?
- That was smart.

367
00:31:36,828 --> 00:31:41,583
You say you got nothing but women,
and throw out a guy. What's going on?

368
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:43,710
You wanted a hostage,
I gave you one.

369
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:47,047
- You gonna deal with us or not?
- I gave you one.

370
00:31:47,297 --> 00:31:50,592
You did, but you should have picked up
the phone. Come on out.

371
00:31:50,759 --> 00:31:53,887
Look. I ain't packing nothing, see?

372
00:31:54,054 --> 00:31:55,430
I ain't packing nothing.

373
00:31:55,597 --> 00:31:58,850
You can come out and frisk me.
You can tell.

374
00:32:00,977 --> 00:32:03,480
- Why you want me to come out?
- To look at something.

375
00:32:04,522 --> 00:32:07,568
- To see what you're up against.
- I can see it. Why come out?

376
00:32:07,818 --> 00:32:10,654
Come out and see it all, all right?
Come on.

377
00:32:11,697 --> 00:32:13,157
All right?

378
00:32:13,699 --> 00:32:18,329
Sal is in there with the other people.
Anything happens to me, they'll get it.

379
00:32:18,704 --> 00:32:21,874
I don't forget about Sal.
Come out and look. Okay?

380
00:32:22,041 --> 00:32:24,293
Come on. Okay?

381
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:28,546
- I gotta check with him first.
- All right. You don't need that artillery.

382
00:32:35,387 --> 00:32:38,515
Sonny, five minutes.
You tell him that.

383
00:32:39,307 --> 00:32:40,475
Take it easy.

384
00:32:41,309 --> 00:32:43,395
Get them back.
He's got a white flag.

385
00:32:43,646 --> 00:32:45,564
All right. Okay.
Everything's all right.

386
00:32:45,731 --> 00:32:48,943
- See that?
- Right, yeah. Okay.

387
00:32:49,944 --> 00:32:52,613
- Come on out, Sonny.
- He's too close here.

388
00:32:52,947 --> 00:32:54,740
Get back!
What the fuck are you doing?

389
00:32:54,907 --> 00:32:56,450
- Get them back.
- Get back!

390
00:32:56,617 --> 00:32:59,787
- All right.
- Okay. Come on out.

391
00:33:00,037 --> 00:33:02,540
Take a look at this. Come on.

392
00:33:02,706 --> 00:33:05,292
Here, look. Look up here. Look.

393
00:33:05,459 --> 00:33:06,627
Look.

394
00:33:08,045 --> 00:33:10,172
Look over here, huh?

395
00:33:14,135 --> 00:33:17,221
Over there, right?
We got everything here, okay?

396
00:33:35,282 --> 00:33:37,451
You got the militia out here, huh?

397
00:33:45,708 --> 00:33:48,085
Let Sal come look.
What hope have you got?

398
00:33:49,587 --> 00:33:51,380
Come on. Quit while you're ahead.

399
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:54,050
- It's only attempted robbery.
- Armed robbery.

400
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:56,720
All right, armed, then.
Nobody's been hurt.

401
00:33:56,970 --> 00:34:00,599
Release the hostages. No one
will worry over kidnapping charges.

402
00:34:00,766 --> 00:34:02,267
The most you'll get is 5 years.

403
00:34:02,434 --> 00:34:04,227
- You'll get out in one year.
- Kiss me.

404
00:34:04,394 --> 00:34:06,480
- What?
- Kiss me.

405
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:09,649
When I'm being fucked,
I like to get kissed on the mouth.

406
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:12,819
You're a city cop, right?
Bank robbery's a federal offense.

407
00:34:12,986 --> 00:34:16,239
They got me on kidnapping, armed
robbery. They're gonna bury me.

408
00:34:16,406 --> 00:34:18,408
I won't talk to somebody
trying to con me.

409
00:34:18,575 --> 00:34:20,452
- Get someone in charge.
- I am in charge.

410
00:34:20,619 --> 00:34:24,289
I won't talk to some flunky pig
trying to con me. What's he doing?

411
00:34:24,623 --> 00:34:26,374
- Get back!
- Why are they moving in?

412
00:34:26,625 --> 00:34:30,796
Will you get the fuck back there?
Get back there. Get over there!

413
00:34:30,962 --> 00:34:33,216
- Go on back there, man!
- Get over there!

414
00:34:33,383 --> 00:34:35,551
He wants to kill me so bad,
he can taste it.

415
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,055
- No one's gonna kill anybody.
- Attica! Attica! Attica!

416
00:34:39,722 --> 00:34:43,267
Attica! Attica! Attica!

417
00:34:43,434 --> 00:34:45,770
Attica! Attica!

418
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:50,065
Attica! Attica! Attica!

419
00:34:50,982 --> 00:34:52,150
Attica!

420
00:34:52,818 --> 00:34:55,487
Attica! Remember Attica!

421
00:34:59,658 --> 00:35:03,787
Go ahead. Go ahead.
Your word don't fucking matter!

422
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:05,747
Come on, calm down.

423
00:35:10,044 --> 00:35:11,462
- To put their guns down!

424
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:13,548
Put your guns down!

425
00:35:13,715 --> 00:35:15,800
Wasn't for the TV guys,
they'd kill us all.

426
00:35:19,011 --> 00:35:21,305
Tell them to put their guns down!
Get back!

427
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:23,391
- Put those guns down!
- Put the guns down!

428
00:35:23,558 --> 00:35:26,185
Get back!
Put those fucking guns down!

429
00:35:26,352 --> 00:35:28,146
Put those guns down!

430
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,649
Put them down! Put them down!

431
00:35:32,483 --> 00:35:34,861
Put those fucking guns down.

432
00:35:35,111 --> 00:35:37,238
Put those guns down.

433
00:35:40,408 --> 00:35:43,035
Attica! Attica!

434
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:56,383
You got it, man!
You got it, man!

435
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:58,761
You got it, man!

436
00:35:59,678 --> 00:36:01,764
You got it! You got it!

437
00:36:04,307 --> 00:36:08,603
You got it, man! You got it, right?
You got it, right?

438
00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:13,066
You got it. You got it.
You got it, right?

439
00:36:13,399 --> 00:36:16,277
<i>- Headquarters in Washington...
- Robbing a bank?</i>

440
00:36:16,527 --> 00:36:19,363
<i>- What was...? What?
- As to the identity of one of the men.</i>

441
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:22,868
Why didn't he tell me
he needed money?

442
00:36:23,118 --> 00:36:27,581
He should've come to me
if he needed money.

443
00:36:28,248 --> 00:36:30,417
I can't believe it.

444
00:36:30,584 --> 00:36:34,755
<i>We know that 8 people
are still being held in the bank.</i>

445
00:36:35,172 --> 00:36:39,051
<i>The situation inside the bank
is totally unknown to us other than...</i>

446
00:36:39,301 --> 00:36:43,097
<i>... descriptions that have been
obtained from Howard Calvin.</i>

447
00:36:43,347 --> 00:36:45,516
Why steal when your mom's a sucker?

448
00:36:45,766 --> 00:36:49,686
<i>We'll switch you now to Ron Cummins
at the bank in Brooklyn.</i>

449
00:36:50,437 --> 00:36:52,398
<i>Miss Benson, what's it like inside?</i>

450
00:36:53,023 --> 00:36:54,900
They're holding up,
what can you say?

451
00:36:55,109 --> 00:36:57,404
- The guy with the gun on us...
- Got a deal?

452
00:36:57,570 --> 00:37:01,950
...he's a quiet type.
- Any confidence in Detective Moretti?

453
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:05,954
They don't know Detective Moretti yet.
I gotta go now.

454
00:37:06,913 --> 00:37:08,706
What's this with the hands?

455
00:37:09,249 --> 00:37:11,000
She's out, let her stay out.

456
00:37:11,167 --> 00:37:14,129
They're my girls.
I'm going back in there.

457
00:37:24,596 --> 00:37:27,558
- Howard, how is he?
- Howard's all right.

458
00:37:27,933 --> 00:37:30,936
- Put the TV on.
- Girls, I was interviewed.

459
00:37:31,103 --> 00:37:34,107
Sal, looks good.

460
00:37:35,066 --> 00:37:37,360
Everybody's out there.
They got the whole media.

461
00:37:37,527 --> 00:37:39,571
Television people. Television people...

462
00:37:39,821 --> 00:37:42,449
...they wanna talk to you.
They're out there.

463
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:49,873
Yeah?

464
00:37:50,039 --> 00:37:52,751
<i>Hello, Sonny.
Sonny, you're on the air.</i>

465
00:37:53,001 --> 00:37:55,545
<i>- Would you answer a few questions?
- Yeah.</i>

466
00:37:56,546 --> 00:37:58,548
<i>Why are you doing this?</i>

467
00:38:02,719 --> 00:38:04,262
<i>- Hello?
- See, now...</i>

468
00:38:04,429 --> 00:38:06,389
...I just saw myself there.
What'd you...?

469
00:38:06,556 --> 00:38:08,308
<i>- Why am I doing it?
- Yes.</i>

470
00:38:08,475 --> 00:38:11,062
<i>- Doing what?
- Robbing a bank.</i>

471
00:38:16,233 --> 00:38:18,360
What? I don't know
what you mean by that.

472
00:38:18,611 --> 00:38:21,322
I'm robbing a bank
because they got money here.

473
00:38:21,572 --> 00:38:24,617
<i>I mean, why do you feel
you have to steal for money?</i>

474
00:38:24,867 --> 00:38:26,285
<i>Couldn 't you get a job?</i>

475
00:38:28,369 --> 00:38:30,663
No. Doing what?

476
00:38:30,955 --> 00:38:35,168
You know... You know, if you want a
job, you gotta be a member of a union.

477
00:38:35,335 --> 00:38:38,505
See. If you got no union card,
you don't get a job.

478
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,548
<i>What about non-union jobs?</i>

479
00:38:43,676 --> 00:38:45,262
What's wrong with this guy?

480
00:38:45,513 --> 00:38:48,224
What do you mean, non-union?
Like what, a bank teller?

481
00:38:48,391 --> 00:38:50,559
- Know how much a bank teller makes?
- Not much.

482
00:38:50,726 --> 00:38:55,106
Not much. $ 115 to start, right?
You gonna live on that?

483
00:38:55,356 --> 00:38:59,610
I got a wife and kids. How am I gonna
live on that? What do you make a week?

484
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:03,280
<i>- I'm here to talk to you, Sonny.
- No, well, I'm... I'm talking to you.</i>

485
00:39:03,531 --> 00:39:06,867
We're entertainment, right?
What do you...? What do you got for us?

486
00:39:07,243 --> 00:39:09,120
<i>What do you want to get for it?</i>

487
00:39:09,370 --> 00:39:13,416
<i>- Do you expect to be paid?
- I don't need to be paid. Look.</i>

488
00:39:13,666 --> 00:39:17,711
I'm here with my partner and nine
other people, see, and we're dying.

489
00:39:17,878 --> 00:39:21,341
You're gonna see our brains on the
sidewalk. They'll spill our guts out.

490
00:39:21,508 --> 00:39:23,009
Gonna show that on television?

491
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:26,012
Have housewives see that?
Instead of "As The World Turns"?

492
00:39:26,179 --> 00:39:28,557
What do you got for me?
I want something for that.

493
00:39:28,724 --> 00:39:29,808
<i>- Sonny.
- Yeah.</i>

494
00:39:29,975 --> 00:39:32,561
<i>- You could give up.
- Give up?</i>

495
00:39:32,811 --> 00:39:34,980
<i>- Right. You ever been in prison?
- No.</i>

496
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:38,358
No. Let's talk about something
you fucking know about, okay?

497
00:39:38,525 --> 00:39:42,403
<i>- How much you make a week?
- Transmission has been interrupted.</i>

498
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:46,157
<i>Please stand by, we will return
to our special newscast very soon.</i>

499
00:39:46,323 --> 00:39:48,868
Hello? What the fuck happened?

500
00:39:51,454 --> 00:39:53,497
Guess he didn't appreciate
your language.

501
00:39:55,624 --> 00:39:56,959
Fuck him.

502
00:40:03,467 --> 00:40:04,885
Sal.

503
00:40:07,679 --> 00:40:09,139
Sal.

504
00:40:25,197 --> 00:40:27,365
I don't know,
they might deal with us.

505
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:31,870
You know? I mean, I don't know about
that guy out there.

506
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:36,667
But if I get the FBI involved in this,
they might deal.

507
00:40:36,834 --> 00:40:38,461
What do you think?

508
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:48,679
No.

509
00:40:49,013 --> 00:40:50,264
- Sal...
- No!

510
00:40:50,765 --> 00:40:53,725
- What's the matter with you?
- You made a promise, didn't you?

511
00:40:53,892 --> 00:40:55,685
- Did you promise me something?
- Yeah.

512
00:40:55,852 --> 00:40:59,606
Did you say either we get away clean
or we kill ourselves?

513
00:40:59,856 --> 00:41:02,651
- Did you?
- I'm not talking about that.

514
00:41:02,818 --> 00:41:04,945
- You believe in keeping your promises?
- Yeah.

515
00:41:05,112 --> 00:41:06,822
- Then does it still go?
- Yeah.

516
00:41:06,988 --> 00:41:10,034
- Well, what are you talking about?
- I'm trying to...

517
00:41:12,662 --> 00:41:15,039
I ain't going back
to that prison, Sonny.

518
00:41:20,002 --> 00:41:22,171
<i>- Yeah.
- Kill them all. Now.</i>

519
00:41:22,338 --> 00:41:25,550
<i>- Take your bayonet, jam it into their...
- Fuck you, you fucker.</i>

520
00:41:38,062 --> 00:41:40,231
Shit.

521
00:42:03,589 --> 00:42:06,299
We ask for a jet.
What do you think?

522
00:42:12,638 --> 00:42:14,599
We get a helicopter.

523
00:42:14,849 --> 00:42:18,352
We get a helicopter here,
it lands on the roof...

524
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:23,484
...and takes us to a jet.
And we fly the fuck out of the country.

525
00:42:24,568 --> 00:42:28,280
Sal. Sal...

526
00:42:28,447 --> 00:42:30,115
...we can do it.

527
00:42:34,870 --> 00:42:37,456
Sal. Sal, look.

528
00:42:37,623 --> 00:42:41,210
We got them. We don't even know it.
We got the hostages.

529
00:42:42,127 --> 00:42:45,964
We've been looking at this the
wrong way. We make the demands.

530
00:42:46,215 --> 00:42:48,926
They're gonna give us
anything we want.

531
00:42:54,890 --> 00:42:57,684
I'm flying to the tropics.
Fuck the snow.

532
00:43:03,983 --> 00:43:05,402
Hey, where's the Mouth?

533
00:43:06,736 --> 00:43:11,074
- You ready to go to Algeria?
- Algeria? Yeah, sure.

534
00:43:11,449 --> 00:43:13,201
We're all going to sunny climes!

535
00:43:13,368 --> 00:43:16,453
Sal, I can make it happen!
I can make it happen!

536
00:43:17,246 --> 00:43:20,624
I made it happen so far, right?
I can make it happen.

537
00:43:27,881 --> 00:43:29,967
- Yeah.
- Give me Moretti.

538
00:43:30,259 --> 00:43:31,927
Sarge.

539
00:43:33,011 --> 00:43:36,349
All of you, go ahead, make phone calls.
Call home or whatever.

540
00:43:36,975 --> 00:43:38,351
We're all going on a trip.

541
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:40,854
<i>- Yeah, Sonny.
- Yeah. I wanna talk to you.</i>

542
00:43:41,146 --> 00:43:44,190
<i>- And I'm coming out.
- Good, I'll be there.</i>

543
00:43:44,441 --> 00:43:46,192
Let's go. Come on, he's coming out.

544
00:43:46,401 --> 00:43:47,694
Sal.

545
00:43:48,111 --> 00:43:50,780
Now, you gotta understand something.

546
00:43:51,030 --> 00:43:54,242
If we leave the country,
there's no coming back here.

547
00:43:55,410 --> 00:43:56,786
There's no coming back.

548
00:43:57,036 --> 00:43:59,330
If there's anyone you wanna talk to...

549
00:43:59,581 --> 00:44:02,584
...you wanna say goodbye to,
do it now.

550
00:44:07,255 --> 00:44:08,590
No.

551
00:44:09,299 --> 00:44:10,718
No.

552
00:44:10,885 --> 00:44:13,721
Is there any special country
you wanna go to?

553
00:44:16,682 --> 00:44:18,517
Wyoming.

554
00:44:20,227 --> 00:44:23,064
No, Wyoming...
That's not a country.

555
00:44:24,315 --> 00:44:26,609
That's all right.
I'll take care of it.

556
00:44:49,757 --> 00:44:51,967
All right, put them down!

557
00:44:55,221 --> 00:44:58,140
Put them down. You need a gun?
What do I have?

558
00:44:58,599 --> 00:45:01,894
See this here, look.
I got nothing up my sleeve.

559
00:45:02,144 --> 00:45:06,023
I got nothing here either.
Wanna see my pockets? Here.

560
00:45:06,273 --> 00:45:09,819
You need that gun, right? Yeah.

561
00:45:10,694 --> 00:45:13,823
Moretti, tell them
to put their guns down!

562
00:45:13,989 --> 00:45:17,868
Hey, you, see that?
Put it in your holster.

563
00:45:22,039 --> 00:45:23,375
Put the guns down!

564
00:45:26,044 --> 00:45:29,214
You know what it means
to put a gun down? What's this?

565
00:45:29,965 --> 00:45:32,467
- What's this?
- Put them down.

566
00:45:32,634 --> 00:45:36,430
Right. Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.

567
00:45:36,888 --> 00:45:38,974
You got it, right?

568
00:45:40,350 --> 00:45:42,351
You got it, baby! Hey, Moretti!

569
00:45:42,601 --> 00:45:44,353
You ready to let these...?

570
00:45:49,775 --> 00:45:51,777
You got Maria in there!

571
00:45:54,572 --> 00:45:56,532
Maria!

572
00:45:57,283 --> 00:46:00,787
He's got a gun in there! Maria!

573
00:46:02,289 --> 00:46:04,916
Maria! Maria!

574
00:46:06,168 --> 00:46:08,420
Get him the fuck out of here!

575
00:46:09,463 --> 00:46:11,089
How the hell did that happen?

576
00:46:11,339 --> 00:46:13,592
- I got Sal in there!
- Take it easy.

577
00:46:13,842 --> 00:46:16,720
- Notify the precinct, all right?
- Who the fuck is that?

578
00:46:17,262 --> 00:46:19,264
No, no, no.
He's one of them Spanish kids.

579
00:46:19,514 --> 00:46:20,974
- Who's Maria?
- She's inside.

580
00:46:21,224 --> 00:46:23,894
Sal wants to see Sonny,
says he'll shoot unless he does.

581
00:46:24,061 --> 00:46:27,147
- Sal. Sal.
- He's serious. Sonny, he means it!

582
00:46:27,314 --> 00:46:30,525
- He means it.
- It's all right. It's all right.

583
00:46:31,318 --> 00:46:32,694
It's all right.

584
00:46:35,406 --> 00:46:37,700
- Hey, man, I'm sorry.
- How'd that happen?

585
00:46:37,867 --> 00:46:40,495
You got his girlfriend.
You know the Spanish. You okay?

586
00:46:40,661 --> 00:46:42,497
That fuck tried to kill me.

587
00:46:42,747 --> 00:46:45,583
- You look all squeezed out.
- Squeezed out, I'm squeezed out.

588
00:46:45,750 --> 00:46:48,669
Yeah, yeah. Okay. Wait, let me see.
Let me see your head.

589
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:51,214
- I'm bleeding.
- Let me see it.

590
00:46:51,589 --> 00:46:52,923
Let me see it.

591
00:46:53,090 --> 00:46:56,635
Oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus.

592
00:46:58,553 --> 00:47:01,681
It's all right. You want to
talk to me about something?

593
00:47:02,349 --> 00:47:04,309
You should've heard that phone call.

594
00:47:04,559 --> 00:47:06,853
Calls up, some creep,
says, "Kill everybody."

595
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:08,855
Everybody wants to kill everybody.

596
00:47:09,106 --> 00:47:11,734
You're gonna get assholes like that
anyhow, right?

597
00:47:11,901 --> 00:47:13,277
Right.

598
00:47:17,281 --> 00:47:19,951
Yeah, I wanna talk to you.
I got an offer.

599
00:47:21,244 --> 00:47:22,787
I want a helicopter out of here.

600
00:47:24,414 --> 00:47:27,625
And a jet to go wherever I wanna go.

601
00:47:27,875 --> 00:47:30,169
So I don't want a little jet,
I want a big one.

602
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:33,840
One with a bar, a piano.
Maybe I wanna go out of the country.

603
00:47:34,006 --> 00:47:37,719
I don't know, Sonny. I don't know
whether a helicopter'll fit in here or not.

604
00:47:38,177 --> 00:47:39,345
I'll check it out.

605
00:47:39,512 --> 00:47:41,806
- It could land on the roof.
- No, that's asphalt.

606
00:47:41,973 --> 00:47:44,100
You know what'll happen,
it'll break through.

607
00:47:44,267 --> 00:47:46,978
I'll call my superiors, you understand?

608
00:47:47,229 --> 00:47:49,314
Why don't you
bring your superiors here?

609
00:47:49,565 --> 00:47:52,276
Why am I talking to you
if you gotta call your superiors?

610
00:47:52,651 --> 00:47:56,280
- We don't always see eye-to-eye.
- Yeah, so I'll talk to them.

611
00:47:56,488 --> 00:47:57,823
I'll see what they say.

612
00:47:58,073 --> 00:48:01,326
I talk to them and I ask them,
all right? Then we'll see.

613
00:48:01,493 --> 00:48:03,203
Anything else I can give you?

614
00:48:06,789 --> 00:48:09,625
Yeah, I want you to bring
my wife down here.

615
00:48:10,293 --> 00:48:12,503
- What do you give us?
- What do you want?

616
00:48:13,337 --> 00:48:14,797
The women hostages.

617
00:48:16,466 --> 00:48:18,885
Oh, man. You know,
there's no talking to you.

618
00:48:19,385 --> 00:48:22,096
That's all I got in there,
I told you, is women.

619
00:48:22,972 --> 00:48:25,017
You gonna talk to me or what?

620
00:48:26,852 --> 00:48:29,688
I'll give you one hostage
for each thing you give me, see?

621
00:48:29,855 --> 00:48:31,982
Give me the helicopter,
I give you a hostage.

622
00:48:32,149 --> 00:48:33,984
Give me the jet, I give you a hostage.

623
00:48:34,234 --> 00:48:36,779
You give me my wife,
I give you a hostage.

624
00:48:37,029 --> 00:48:39,281
Then the rest come home on the jet.

625
00:48:41,408 --> 00:48:43,452
I'll see what they'll do, all right?

626
00:48:44,036 --> 00:48:46,830
In the meantime, you pick out
who you wanna give us.

627
00:48:47,081 --> 00:48:50,000
And you tell me where
your wife is, all right?

628
00:48:50,542 --> 00:48:54,463
<i>I'm here minding my own business,
I hear the transistor, go, "Sonny what?"</i>

629
00:48:54,713 --> 00:48:57,049
<i>I can 't believe my ears.
I grab the kids.</i>

630
00:48:57,216 --> 00:49:00,595
<i>I'm telling you, Sonny didn 't do it.
It ain 't him to rob a bank!</i>

631
00:49:00,845 --> 00:49:04,349
<i>It ain 't him to steal or hurt anybody
or do nothing wrong!</i>

632
00:49:04,641 --> 00:49:07,310
<i>He's never done wrong
since the day I know him.</i>

633
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:11,523
<i>Night before last we're at Coney Island.
I'm looking in the glove compartment.</i>

634
00:49:11,689 --> 00:49:13,608
<i>He's got a gun with bullets in it.</i>

635
00:49:13,858 --> 00:49:16,444
<i>Things are adding up
how crazy he's acting lately...</i>

636
00:49:16,694 --> 00:49:19,863
...and in with a bad crowd.
So I look at him.

637
00:49:20,030 --> 00:49:22,825
Go on, get in bed. He's yelling
at the kids like a madman.

638
00:49:23,075 --> 00:49:26,328
Then he wants me to go on a
kiddie ride. I don't wanna go.

639
00:49:26,578 --> 00:49:29,498
He starts screaming at me.
Sweetheart.

640
00:49:29,665 --> 00:49:32,376
He's screaming and screaming.

641
00:49:32,626 --> 00:49:35,379
I say, "What are you
gonna do with the gun?

642
00:49:35,630 --> 00:49:37,507
Shoot me and dump me in the river?"

643
00:49:37,966 --> 00:49:41,094
I mean, I was scared of him.
I never been scared of him.

644
00:49:41,344 --> 00:49:45,140
His mother says we was always fighting,
the cops was always at our house.

645
00:49:45,390 --> 00:49:48,768
I hit him with a jack handle
once in the car.

646
00:49:49,227 --> 00:49:51,271
Only I didn't even hit him,
I hit myself.

647
00:49:51,438 --> 00:49:54,315
You should've seen the bruise
on my leg, from here to here.

648
00:49:54,482 --> 00:49:57,736
He'd put on his hat and coat,
he goes out the door.

649
00:49:59,946 --> 00:50:03,283
So they tell me he did it.
But I don't believe it.

650
00:50:03,450 --> 00:50:06,995
Mrs. Wortzik, please, listen to me.
They want you down at the bank.

651
00:50:07,245 --> 00:50:11,499
His body functions might've done it,
but he himself, he didn't do it!

652
00:50:19,258 --> 00:50:23,637
"Dear Abby: Lately I've been dreaming
about falling into water...

653
00:50:23,804 --> 00:50:26,807
...and not being able
to reach the surface.

654
00:50:27,391 --> 00:50:31,436
I begin to breathe heavily
and I wake up in a cold sweat.

655
00:50:31,686 --> 00:50:36,357
A friend tells me that my problem
is one of sexual repression."

656
00:50:37,108 --> 00:50:40,070
- Margaret, are you all right?
- No.

657
00:50:40,236 --> 00:50:44,157
<i>What are you, a renegade, a bandit?
What kind of man are you...</i>

658
00:50:44,324 --> 00:50:47,077
<i>... siding with the Indians
against his own people?</i>

659
00:50:47,243 --> 00:50:51,874
<i>- What's your grudge against me?
- I'm taking you in for murder, Kilgore.</i>

660
00:50:56,796 --> 00:50:57,838
Yeah?

661
00:50:58,005 --> 00:51:01,342
<i>Are you doing anything
to any of those girls in there?</i>

662
00:51:02,051 --> 00:51:03,886
He's back again.

663
00:51:04,970 --> 00:51:06,555
<i>Well?</i>

664
00:51:09,350 --> 00:51:11,185
<i>Who is this?</i>

665
00:51:12,645 --> 00:51:14,480
Look at Margaret.

666
00:51:17,483 --> 00:51:19,235
What's the matter with her?

667
00:51:19,944 --> 00:51:21,946
There's no air in here.

668
00:51:25,951 --> 00:51:28,620
What happened to the air conditioning?

669
00:51:33,625 --> 00:51:37,421
- I'm sorry, Syl.
- It's all right.

670
00:51:38,463 --> 00:51:41,925
- Where's the air conditioning?
- The basement.

671
00:51:46,345 --> 00:51:49,682
Sal, I'm gonna go
check the air conditioning.

672
00:51:49,932 --> 00:51:52,810
- I'll be right back.
- Sonny.

673
00:51:57,815 --> 00:51:59,316
What?

674
00:52:00,652 --> 00:52:03,488
I never been up in an airplane before.

675
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:10,162
So? I mean...

676
00:52:11,413 --> 00:52:15,542
I mean, it's safe. It's like a car.
It's safer than a car.

677
00:52:18,378 --> 00:52:20,046
It's all right, Sal.

678
00:52:25,886 --> 00:52:29,056
- I'm gonna go check it now.
- Okay.

679
00:52:52,955 --> 00:52:54,082
- Sal!
- What?

680
00:52:54,247 --> 00:52:57,000
- They're coming in the back!
- In the vault! Come on.

681
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:00,629
- Goddamn it, move!
- Back, get back.

682
00:53:00,796 --> 00:53:02,047
No, don't shoot!

683
00:53:09,429 --> 00:53:12,350
That's it, Sonny! Get her in there!
Do it!

684
00:53:13,601 --> 00:53:15,061
Get her in there!

685
00:53:16,604 --> 00:53:17,980
Who fired that shot?

686
00:53:19,816 --> 00:53:21,275
Pick her up by the legs.

687
00:53:23,486 --> 00:53:25,154
Who fired the shot?

688
00:53:26,572 --> 00:53:28,032
Come on! Move!

689
00:53:28,658 --> 00:53:30,868
Okay, legs. I'll bring her.

690
00:53:31,577 --> 00:53:33,371
<i>- They're moving good.
- What's that?</i>

691
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:37,625
Sonny?

692
00:53:38,501 --> 00:53:40,628
Sonny! Get me a bullhorn.

693
00:53:44,966 --> 00:53:46,342
Sonny!

694
00:53:50,431 --> 00:53:53,976
- You got that bullhorn?
- Right. Here.

695
00:53:57,438 --> 00:53:58,772
Hey, Sonny.

696
00:54:01,066 --> 00:54:02,526
Come on out, Sonny.

697
00:54:04,445 --> 00:54:06,405
- Sonny.
- Sonny!

698
00:54:06,571 --> 00:54:07,780
That's all I need.

699
00:54:10,408 --> 00:54:12,618
- Sonny?
- Sonny!

700
00:54:12,785 --> 00:54:14,704
Come on, take care of that, will you?

701
00:54:15,955 --> 00:54:18,249
- Sonny, come on out.
- Sonny, come on out.

702
00:54:18,416 --> 00:54:20,793
Go straighten that out,
will you, Carmine? Sonny!

703
00:54:22,086 --> 00:54:23,671
Sonny, come on out.

704
00:54:25,883 --> 00:54:28,093
- Sonny?
- You did fine.

705
00:54:28,302 --> 00:54:29,845
Sonny.

706
00:54:33,223 --> 00:54:34,266
Sonny!

707
00:54:34,433 --> 00:54:37,728
You son of a bitch,
you wanna get those people killed?

708
00:54:37,978 --> 00:54:39,855
Come on out, Sonny.

709
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:45,444
Sonny, come on out.

710
00:54:49,364 --> 00:54:50,783
Come on out here, now.

711
00:54:53,952 --> 00:54:57,039
Come on out, Sonny. Sonny!

712
00:55:01,086 --> 00:55:02,754
Sonny?

713
00:55:05,507 --> 00:55:07,467
Come on out here, Sonny.

714
00:55:09,469 --> 00:55:11,429
All right, I see it, Sonny. Come on.

715
00:55:11,596 --> 00:55:14,474
Come on. All right, get back.

716
00:55:18,436 --> 00:55:20,145
Wait, wait. People, wait.

717
00:55:24,858 --> 00:55:26,193
Keep going.

718
00:55:28,779 --> 00:55:30,239
What's the matter with you?

719
00:55:31,073 --> 00:55:33,659
- What?
- What're you firing that shot for?

720
00:55:33,909 --> 00:55:35,411
We got 250 cops here!

721
00:55:35,661 --> 00:55:37,914
Fuck you! What were
they doing back there?

722
00:55:38,164 --> 00:55:40,417
What the hell's the matter with you?

723
00:55:41,376 --> 00:55:42,669
Are we dealing?

724
00:55:42,836 --> 00:55:44,838
- They were trying to get in, right?
- Who?

725
00:55:45,088 --> 00:55:47,424
Come on, don't give me that shit.
You know who.

726
00:55:47,715 --> 00:55:49,717
- What's going on?
- You're full of shit!

727
00:55:49,884 --> 00:55:51,928
Find out what's going on there!

728
00:55:52,178 --> 00:55:54,848
- Honest to God, Sonny, I don't know...
- Bullshit!

729
00:55:55,098 --> 00:55:57,016
Communications aren't set up yet.

730
00:55:57,267 --> 00:55:59,561
- Get someone to talk to me!
- Goddamn it.

731
00:55:59,811 --> 00:56:01,730
I'm not talking to you anymore.

732
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:04,399
- Let me talk to you.
- You say this, you do that.

733
00:56:04,649 --> 00:56:05,942
Why were they back there?!

734
00:56:06,234 --> 00:56:08,486
- I don't know!
- You're full of shit.

735
00:56:08,737 --> 00:56:10,613
That's another force, a tactical force!

736
00:56:10,864 --> 00:56:13,409
They like to shoot,
climb through windows!

737
00:56:13,659 --> 00:56:16,579
They like that, right?
Without your orders, right?

738
00:56:16,829 --> 00:56:18,289
No. Yes! Without my orders!

739
00:56:18,581 --> 00:56:21,333
- You're not coming through the roof?
- I tell you we won't.

740
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:24,962
You're telling me a lot of things,
but you're not doing them.

741
00:56:25,212 --> 00:56:26,464
What were they doing?!

742
00:56:26,756 --> 00:56:28,966
- I don't know!
- You can't answer me, right?

743
00:56:29,133 --> 00:56:30,676
- You can't answer me.
- What?

744
00:56:30,843 --> 00:56:32,427
- You can't answer me.
- Yes, I can.

745
00:56:32,635 --> 00:56:34,679
So tell me what they were doing.

746
00:56:34,971 --> 00:56:37,474
No communications!
I sent someone back there.

747
00:56:37,724 --> 00:56:41,603
I got a guy in there who's gonna kill
somebody. That's your responsibility.

748
00:56:41,770 --> 00:56:44,481
- Not mine, that's yours.
- Wait a minute, hold on. Let's...

749
00:56:44,647 --> 00:56:46,566
- We got everything you wanted.
- Oh, yeah?

750
00:56:46,733 --> 00:56:49,820
Yeah. We can't get a helicopter in here,
but a bus is coming.

751
00:56:50,279 --> 00:56:53,115
We got a jet coming into Kennedy,
all right?

752
00:56:53,282 --> 00:56:55,534
Okay? All right?

753
00:56:57,453 --> 00:56:59,330
Now, we got ahold of your wife.

754
00:57:00,122 --> 00:57:01,540
Your wife is coming.

755
00:57:01,707 --> 00:57:04,001
We reached her
and she's coming here, all right?

756
00:57:04,543 --> 00:57:07,046
- Okay?
- Where you going? Where you going?

757
00:57:07,213 --> 00:57:09,757
I'm right here.
I thought we were gonna talk.

758
00:57:10,216 --> 00:57:12,134
I thought so too.
But we're not talking.

759
00:57:12,301 --> 00:57:14,178
We're trying to get in the back door.

760
00:57:14,428 --> 00:57:17,932
Your wife will be here
in about a half-hour. Okay?

761
00:57:18,099 --> 00:57:20,142
They're still pointing.
They love to point.

762
00:57:20,393 --> 00:57:22,770
Holster that weapon!
Holster it!

763
00:57:23,187 --> 00:57:24,730
Holster that weapon!

764
00:57:25,482 --> 00:57:27,109
You too!

765
00:57:28,985 --> 00:57:30,237
All right, come on.

766
00:57:30,529 --> 00:57:32,697
- What?
- What else do you want me to do?

767
00:57:32,948 --> 00:57:35,033
How could you do any better?

768
00:57:35,575 --> 00:57:36,952
We got everything you wanted.

769
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:39,454
I'll do anything I can
to stop anything I can.

770
00:57:42,124 --> 00:57:43,416
Anything else?

771
00:57:43,666 --> 00:57:45,251
- Yeah.
- What?

772
00:57:45,501 --> 00:57:48,003
I got some people
in there that are hungry.

773
00:57:48,170 --> 00:57:51,006
- Can you get some food?
- No problem. What do you want?

774
00:57:51,173 --> 00:57:52,842
- Want some pizzas?
- Yeah, all right.

775
00:57:53,008 --> 00:57:54,093
Pizzas?

776
00:57:54,260 --> 00:57:57,722
Hey, Carmine, get some food,
some pizzas.

777
00:57:58,389 --> 00:58:00,266
Can we get some beer, you think?

778
00:58:00,558 --> 00:58:03,186
No beer.
Let's keep it to soft drinks, all right?

779
00:58:03,603 --> 00:58:06,022
Come on. All right? Carmine...

780
00:58:06,189 --> 00:58:08,817
...some soft drinks too, okay?
Cokes.

781
00:58:09,067 --> 00:58:10,944
- What else?
- I need some aspirin too.

782
00:58:11,194 --> 00:58:12,654
Some lady's not feeling well.

783
00:58:13,363 --> 00:58:15,198
You got it. Anything else?

784
00:58:15,866 --> 00:58:19,411
- Just don't fucking con me.
- I'm not. Why would I wanna do that?

785
00:58:19,578 --> 00:58:23,623
I'm in trouble enough as it is.
I'm not trying to create any trouble.

786
00:58:24,207 --> 00:58:25,542
All right?

787
00:58:33,008 --> 00:58:34,342
It's okay.

788
00:58:38,389 --> 00:58:41,601
They can't... They can't bring
a helicopter in here, Sal.

789
00:58:41,768 --> 00:58:43,519
Because they can't land it here.

790
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:47,148
But they're gonna get us a limo bus...
A big bus so we can all get in.

791
00:58:47,315 --> 00:58:49,275
And that's how we get to the airport.

792
00:58:50,443 --> 00:58:52,153
It's good. It looks good.

793
00:58:54,989 --> 00:58:59,034
You people,
I just ordered you some food, so...

794
00:58:59,201 --> 00:59:01,286
I even got her some aspirins.

795
00:59:01,453 --> 00:59:03,538
Okay? So we're moving it along now.

796
00:59:03,955 --> 00:59:07,250
I gotta pay for the food.
Where's the marked fives?

797
00:59:07,501 --> 00:59:10,170
That was a foolish thing
you did back there.

798
00:59:12,005 --> 00:59:14,092
- Yeah?
- Foolish thing.

799
00:59:17,553 --> 00:59:19,305
We gonna get the ball rolling?

800
00:59:19,889 --> 00:59:22,100
Yeah, what do you think I'm doing?

801
00:59:22,350 --> 00:59:24,519
I'm working on it, right?
What's it look like?

802
00:59:24,685 --> 00:59:27,063
You think it's easy?
I gotta keep them cool.

803
00:59:27,313 --> 00:59:29,065
I gotta keep all you people happy.

804
00:59:29,315 --> 00:59:31,567
I gotta have all the ideas
and do it all alone.

805
00:59:31,734 --> 00:59:33,486
I'm working on it.
You wanna try it?

806
00:59:33,986 --> 00:59:36,364
<i>Your food is here, Sonny.</i>

807
00:59:37,907 --> 00:59:39,909
You're starting to get on my nerves.

808
00:59:48,459 --> 00:59:52,756
All right. Go on with him there.
You'll be all right. Go right here.

809
00:59:55,843 --> 00:59:58,262
- What do I owe you?
- It's all paid for.

810
00:59:58,429 --> 00:59:59,888
- It's paid for.
- I paid for it.

811
01:00:00,055 --> 01:00:01,682
No, I got it. I got it.

812
01:00:02,224 --> 01:00:04,852
Here. Keep the change.

813
01:00:08,354 --> 01:00:09,689
What?

814
01:00:12,191 --> 01:00:13,901
- You want this?
- Yeah!

815
01:00:17,363 --> 01:00:18,406
You like it?

816
01:00:28,584 --> 01:00:30,711
Moretti, could you use five?

817
01:00:39,052 --> 01:00:41,221
I got a lot for you.

818
01:00:50,439 --> 01:00:51,774
Get back!

819
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:55,903
Get back, goddamn it! Get back!

820
01:00:57,112 --> 01:01:00,240
Let him go. Let him go.

821
01:01:11,795 --> 01:01:15,632
More! More! More!

822
01:01:15,799 --> 01:01:19,969
More! More! More!

823
01:01:24,098 --> 01:01:26,266
Could you open it?

824
01:01:27,559 --> 01:01:28,977
Thank you, man.

825
01:01:29,770 --> 01:01:31,480
See you later.

826
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:36,235
I'm a fucking star!

827
01:01:59,259 --> 01:02:01,636
- Okay, kick...
- Right.

828
01:02:01,803 --> 01:02:03,805
...out, turn.
- Around.

829
01:02:03,972 --> 01:02:08,435
No, just pick her up and hold her.
She'll be okay.

830
01:02:09,144 --> 01:02:11,896
You get your kick good. Here.

831
01:02:20,656 --> 01:02:23,325
Kick, out...

832
01:02:23,492 --> 01:02:25,494
This is where it gets stuck.

833
01:02:26,871 --> 01:02:29,039
- Is that it?
- Yeah.

834
01:02:29,206 --> 01:02:30,291
Here.

835
01:02:30,458 --> 01:02:34,502
- Miriam's making a fool of herself.
- Out.

836
01:02:34,753 --> 01:02:37,964
- Anybody got a cigarette?
- Yeah, I do.

837
01:02:38,214 --> 01:02:39,716
Sylvia, you don't smoke.

838
01:02:42,051 --> 01:02:43,845
You don't smoke?

839
01:02:44,763 --> 01:02:46,181
No.

840
01:02:47,432 --> 01:02:49,350
Why...? Why do you wanna start now?

841
01:02:49,642 --> 01:02:52,521
I'm scared to death, that's why.
What, you don't smoke?

842
01:02:53,606 --> 01:02:55,524
- No.
- How come?

843
01:03:00,654 --> 01:03:02,907
- I don't want the cancer.
- Oh, my God.

844
01:03:03,199 --> 01:03:06,619
- Give me the cigarette.
- Go ahead, do what you want.

845
01:03:08,245 --> 01:03:10,623
I just think you ought to
take care of your body.

846
01:03:10,873 --> 01:03:13,959
My body? What for?

847
01:03:15,753 --> 01:03:18,464
The body is the temple of the Lord.

848
01:03:21,133 --> 01:03:22,426
You're serious.

849
01:03:25,304 --> 01:03:27,182
So you rob a bank...

850
01:03:27,432 --> 01:03:31,061
...but you keep your body pure.
Is that it?

851
01:03:35,899 --> 01:03:37,692
You gonna smoke or what?

852
01:03:40,070 --> 01:03:41,405
Yes.

853
01:03:41,571 --> 01:03:44,199
If I die of cancer,
it'll be half your fault.

854
01:03:49,578 --> 01:03:53,791
- No, it's because you're weak.
- Right, I'm weak.

855
01:03:54,333 --> 01:03:57,211
- One, two, three...
- Where's your bullets?

856
01:03:57,461 --> 01:03:58,963
Mulvaney speaking.

857
01:04:01,841 --> 01:04:03,301
It's Moretti.

858
01:04:04,845 --> 01:04:06,680
Wants to talk to you.

859
01:04:08,223 --> 01:04:10,684
<i>- Yeah.
- Will you guys hold it down back there?</i>

860
01:04:10,851 --> 01:04:13,353
<i>Sonny, they're bringing in your wife.</i>

861
01:04:27,325 --> 01:04:29,703
Step back. Stay back.

862
01:04:30,203 --> 01:04:32,581
- Where's Moretti?
- Probably in the bar.

863
01:04:40,465 --> 01:04:42,925
In the barbershop.

864
01:04:45,470 --> 01:04:47,013
What's that?

865
01:04:47,930 --> 01:04:49,974
We went to Bellevue
where you told us...

866
01:04:50,224 --> 01:04:51,642
...said he was his wife.

867
01:04:51,893 --> 01:04:53,644
They were married in a church.

868
01:04:53,936 --> 01:04:55,354
Jesus Christ!

869
01:04:56,022 --> 01:04:57,105
Leon.

870
01:05:00,901 --> 01:05:02,360
Leon!

871
01:05:02,944 --> 01:05:04,613
Hey, Leon, over here!

872
01:05:05,113 --> 01:05:07,407
Leon! Hey, Leon!

873
01:05:07,574 --> 01:05:10,243
- Now move it back.
- Leon, over here!

874
01:05:10,494 --> 01:05:13,246
Leon! Happy birthday!

875
01:05:23,216 --> 01:05:25,384
- Hey, give us some room, huh?
- Watch his head.

876
01:05:30,139 --> 01:05:31,682
He's a queer?

877
01:05:32,016 --> 01:05:34,936
Sarge. Sarge, he wants you!

878
01:05:36,354 --> 01:05:39,524
Come on, get the shield out of here.
I don't need it now.

879
01:05:39,774 --> 01:05:42,068
Where were you 4 hours ago,
when I needed it?

880
01:05:42,318 --> 01:05:44,779
He's not gonna shoot.
Yeah, Sonny, what?

881
01:05:45,029 --> 01:05:47,198
What happened? Is he all right?

882
01:05:47,448 --> 01:05:50,785
- He's a little groggy right now, okay?
- No, let me talk to him.

883
01:05:50,952 --> 01:05:54,248
Let me get him on his feet and
call you back. Shut the fucking door.

884
01:05:57,251 --> 01:06:00,170
Stop the noise in here.
I don't wanna hear a fucking sound!

885
01:06:00,421 --> 01:06:01,463
Typewriter!

886
01:06:02,297 --> 01:06:04,383
- Get off the fucking phone!
- Sarge.

887
01:06:04,842 --> 01:06:06,135
Now!

888
01:06:06,969 --> 01:06:08,887
Give me some water, all right?

889
01:06:11,389 --> 01:06:14,058
Leon? Leon.

890
01:06:14,767 --> 01:06:18,646
You all right, man? They give you a shot
down at the hospital or something?

891
01:06:19,689 --> 01:06:22,775
Oh, God.
They shot me with, like, unreal!

892
01:06:23,025 --> 01:06:24,819
You gotta get ahold of yourself...

893
01:06:25,278 --> 01:06:28,407
...so you can talk to him,
see if he'll come out of the bank.

894
01:06:28,574 --> 01:06:29,992
Oh, no.

895
01:06:30,159 --> 01:06:32,828
He's got 8 people, and a kid
named Sal. You know him?

896
01:06:33,162 --> 01:06:36,498
- No, not really.
- Says he's gonna shoot these 8 people.

897
01:06:36,707 --> 01:06:40,252
I can't help it.
I can't stop him from anything.

898
01:06:40,544 --> 01:06:42,212
Who will he listen to, then?

899
01:06:42,463 --> 01:06:45,382
I can't... I can't talk to him.
He won't listen to anybody.

900
01:06:45,549 --> 01:06:48,218
He's been...
He's been crazy all summer.

901
01:06:49,636 --> 01:06:51,346
He's tried to kill me since June.

902
01:06:52,848 --> 01:06:56,226
Yeah. Put a gun to my head.
And he cut me with a knife.

903
01:06:56,393 --> 01:06:59,354
- He beat up my friends.
- Did you contact the police?

904
01:07:00,564 --> 01:07:02,232
What good would that do?

905
01:07:02,566 --> 01:07:06,404
It'd just make him mad. They don't
know him. And it wouldn't stop him.

906
01:07:06,654 --> 01:07:11,034
- Somebody's gotta stop him.
- You don't understand. He's crazy.

907
01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:16,664
He's got a wife, children.

908
01:07:17,957 --> 01:07:19,959
He's a wonderful father.

909
01:07:20,835 --> 01:07:21,919
His mother...

910
01:07:22,086 --> 01:07:26,340
...you should see her. Together with
his father, they're like a car wreck.

911
01:07:27,341 --> 01:07:29,760
It just... It just rolls off his back.

912
01:07:30,010 --> 01:07:33,055
He sees them.
He pays the rent. Unbelievable.

913
01:07:34,932 --> 01:07:39,061
I was the one who wanted to get
married. He didn't really want it...

914
01:07:39,854 --> 01:07:41,940
...but he did it.
I don't know why.

915
01:07:42,899 --> 01:07:44,526
Why did you wanna get married?

916
01:07:48,530 --> 01:07:50,740
I thought it would help me.

917
01:07:52,826 --> 01:07:54,536
But it didn't.

918
01:07:54,911 --> 01:07:58,206
I... I was so confused.
I was doing...

919
01:07:58,373 --> 01:07:59,958
...insane things.

920
01:08:01,084 --> 01:08:02,585
What sort of things, Leon?

921
01:08:07,424 --> 01:08:09,050
After the wedding...

922
01:08:09,759 --> 01:08:12,762
...I ran off for 10 days
to Atlantic City.

923
01:08:13,721 --> 01:08:15,891
Sonny was frantic.

924
01:08:16,058 --> 01:08:20,229
He knew I'd been drinking. He didn't
know where I was, who I was with.

925
01:08:21,397 --> 01:08:24,525
I couldn't explain the things I did.

926
01:08:24,775 --> 01:08:27,069
So I went to a psychiatrist...

927
01:08:27,403 --> 01:08:28,946
...who told me...

928
01:08:29,572 --> 01:08:33,576
...that I was a woman
trapped in a man's body.

929
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:45,044
So right away Sonny wanted to give me
money for the sex change operation.

930
01:08:45,295 --> 01:08:47,255
But where was he gonna get it?

931
01:08:47,505 --> 01:08:50,008
$2,500?

932
01:08:50,175 --> 01:08:52,928
My God, he was in hock
up to his ears already.

933
01:08:53,179 --> 01:08:55,014
He needed the money
for your operation?

934
01:08:55,264 --> 01:08:58,309
It drove him crazy. He...

935
01:08:58,476 --> 01:09:00,936
He would fly into these rages.

936
01:09:01,812 --> 01:09:04,023
And I got more depressed than ever.

937
01:09:04,315 --> 01:09:06,776
I knew I'd never get my operation.

938
01:09:09,653 --> 01:09:13,532
So I tried to kill myself.
I took about a half a pound of pills.

939
01:09:13,699 --> 01:09:18,204
Blues, reds, yellows, screamers,
uppers, downers, you name it.

940
01:09:18,788 --> 01:09:20,623
And I wound up in a hospital.

941
01:09:22,833 --> 01:09:24,960
And Sonny comes there...

942
01:09:25,211 --> 01:09:27,421
...and he just looks at me.

943
01:09:28,590 --> 01:09:30,258
And he says:

944
01:09:30,509 --> 01:09:32,469
"Why, Leon?

945
01:09:32,803 --> 01:09:35,430
When things were going so good?"

946
01:09:40,060 --> 01:09:41,937
Don't you think...?

947
01:09:42,521 --> 01:09:45,774
Leon, don't you think
he sort of did it for you?

948
01:09:49,402 --> 01:09:51,404
Yeah, I guess so.

949
01:09:53,072 --> 01:09:55,991
Don't you think you owe it to him
to try to get him out?

950
01:09:57,493 --> 01:09:59,620
I can't talk to him.

951
01:10:01,664 --> 01:10:04,918
You're up to your neck in it, Leon.
You're an accessory.

952
01:10:05,335 --> 01:10:10,215
- No, no. They can't hold me responsible.
- Wait, you could help us a little.

953
01:10:10,590 --> 01:10:11,633
I'm afraid.

954
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:15,303
Just talk to him for a minute.
How can he hurt you on the phone?

955
01:10:16,430 --> 01:10:20,809
- All you're gonna be is on the phone.
- I can't. I don't know what to...

956
01:10:21,059 --> 01:10:24,354
- Just talk with him on the phone.
- I can't. No.

957
01:10:30,277 --> 01:10:32,404
You think about it, Leon.

958
01:10:33,405 --> 01:10:34,656
Yeah.

959
01:10:39,453 --> 01:10:42,915
- He doesn't wanna talk to you.
- What do you mean, won't talk to me?

960
01:10:43,958 --> 01:10:46,794
- Let me work on it.
- I thought you were doing that.

961
01:10:55,595 --> 01:10:57,638
He don't wanna talk to me.

962
01:11:12,110 --> 01:11:16,031
<i>Police are questioning Leon Shermer,

981

Sonny. Sonny, they said,
"Two homosexuals in the bank."

982
01:12:33,152 --> 01:12:35,863
- Right on TV. You hear?
- What difference does it make?

983
01:12:36,029 --> 01:12:39,491
They're gonna say anything they want.
Let them say it.

984
01:12:44,663 --> 01:12:45,998
Well, I'm not a homosexual.

985
01:12:48,709 --> 01:12:52,921
Tell them to get that right.
That's going out on the TV.

986
01:12:57,176 --> 01:13:01,764
Sal, what am I supposed to do? I can't
control what they say on television.

987
01:13:03,390 --> 01:13:06,811
What should I do? I'm doing
everything I can. I can't do that.

988
01:13:07,562 --> 01:13:09,105
I mean, they're...

989
01:13:11,399 --> 01:13:13,026
Look, Sal.

990
01:13:13,485 --> 01:13:17,572
Forget about it. It's just a freak show
to them, anyway. It don't matter.

991
01:13:17,739 --> 01:13:19,574
Whatever they say, it don't matter.

992
01:13:25,746 --> 01:13:27,331
It'll be all right.

993
01:13:36,465 --> 01:13:38,258
What's the matter with you?

994
01:13:39,843 --> 01:13:42,847
You shouldn't let something like that
spoil your fun, you know?

995
01:13:43,014 --> 01:13:45,183
You gotta get fun out of life.

996
01:13:50,647 --> 01:13:51,856
Shit.

997
01:13:52,023 --> 01:13:54,067
Where's the goddamn jet?

998
01:13:55,110 --> 01:13:57,946
They're always screaming overhead,
going somewhere...

999
01:13:58,113 --> 01:14:00,281
...when you don't need them,
you know?

1000
01:14:23,806 --> 01:14:28,269
What are you gonna tell the pilot
when you get on the plane?

1001
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:31,313
You have to know, right?

1002
01:14:31,480 --> 01:14:33,691
- Did you know Holland's pretty good.
- Use this.

1003
01:14:33,941 --> 01:14:37,485
- Holland?
- They sheltered people during the war.

1004
01:14:38,111 --> 01:14:39,863
They're good people.

1005
01:14:40,071 --> 01:14:41,531
Where's Holland?

1006
01:14:41,781 --> 01:14:44,951
- It's right up...
- It's over there.

1007
01:14:47,746 --> 01:14:49,080
She doesn't have a map.

1008
01:14:49,247 --> 01:14:51,458
It's got good chocolate.

1009
01:14:53,878 --> 01:14:56,380
Come on, get in the vault.
Get in the vault. Come on.

1010
01:14:56,547 --> 01:14:57,590
Quickly!

1011
01:15:09,769 --> 01:15:12,563
They're waiting for us
to do something, I think.

1012
01:15:16,192 --> 01:15:17,610
Sonny.

1013
01:15:19,070 --> 01:15:21,822
- Come on out for a second, please.
- It's him, Sonny.

1014
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:24,700
Come on out here.
I wanna talk to you a second.

1015
01:15:27,453 --> 01:15:29,664
- Come on, Sonny.
- Sonny.

1016
01:15:37,464 --> 01:15:38,882
Sonny.

1017
01:15:39,633 --> 01:15:41,218
Come on out, Sonny.

1018
01:15:42,344 --> 01:15:43,845
Sonny?

1019
01:15:48,474 --> 01:15:50,434
Come on out a minute.

1020
01:15:51,519 --> 01:15:53,145
That's it, Sonny.

1021
01:15:58,859 --> 01:16:01,362
Hey, Sonny!

1022
01:16:05,616 --> 01:16:06,660
Moretti!

1023
01:16:09,329 --> 01:16:13,500
What the fuck is going on?
Get the lights back on.

1024
01:16:13,875 --> 01:16:15,544
Moretti!

1025
01:16:17,170 --> 01:16:18,213
Who are you?

1026
01:16:19,714 --> 01:16:21,550
FBI, Sheldon.

1027
01:16:24,136 --> 01:16:25,887
Oh, good.

1028
01:16:26,054 --> 01:16:29,057
About time. Maybe we can
get this thing started, huh?

1029
01:16:29,224 --> 01:16:31,017
Look, get the lights back on...

1030
01:16:31,184 --> 01:16:34,438
...and the air conditioner.
We got no air conditioning.

1031
01:16:34,688 --> 01:16:38,275
- No more favors. That's all over, Sonny.
- Favors?

1032
01:16:38,608 --> 01:16:40,902
You been doing me favors all night?

1033
01:16:41,611 --> 01:16:45,450
I have a jet, limo will be here
in a half hour.

1034
01:16:47,326 --> 01:16:49,537
I want the hostages.

1035
01:16:50,288 --> 01:16:51,956
No, no, no. Bullshit.

1036
01:16:52,749 --> 01:16:55,251
I'd like to work with you on this,
not against you.

1037
01:16:55,501 --> 01:16:57,754
The hostages are
what's keeping me alive.

1038
01:16:59,881 --> 01:17:01,173
When do I get them?

1039
01:17:02,924 --> 01:17:04,509
Didn't they tell you anything?

1040
01:17:06,428 --> 01:17:08,346
I'd like to hear it from you.

1041
01:17:10,265 --> 01:17:14,603
You get one hostage for the
limousine that you bring me in.

1042
01:17:15,228 --> 01:17:18,232
One hos... One hostage for the jet.

1043
01:17:18,691 --> 01:17:22,111
Then I get to the airport.
I go into the plane, check it all out.

1044
01:17:22,361 --> 01:17:24,906
And if it's okay,
then they all come out.

1045
01:17:27,033 --> 01:17:29,368
- I wanna go inside.
- Why?

1046
01:17:29,619 --> 01:17:32,955
- To see if everybody's all right.
- They're all right.

1047
01:17:33,289 --> 01:17:34,832
No, I have to see.

1048
01:17:43,966 --> 01:17:45,426
You got guts.

1049
01:17:45,676 --> 01:17:48,930
Think if we slit their throats,
we're gonna let you out?

1050
01:17:49,263 --> 01:17:50,932
I have to see.

1051
01:18:02,403 --> 01:18:04,530
I gotta check with my partner.

1052
01:18:11,954 --> 01:18:14,455
The FBI, Sal. They're coming in.

1053
01:18:20,795 --> 01:18:23,714
Hey, pussycat. There you go.

1054
01:18:29,220 --> 01:18:32,474
You'd like to kill me?
Bet you would.

1055
01:18:32,724 --> 01:18:35,936
I wouldn't like to kill you.
I will if I have to.

1056
01:18:36,186 --> 01:18:38,105
It's your job, right?

1057
01:18:39,356 --> 01:18:40,899
The guy who kills me...

1058
01:18:41,150 --> 01:18:45,362
...I hope he does it because he hates
my guts, not because it's his job.

1059
01:18:51,952 --> 01:18:55,080
Nobody give your right name.
It's the FBI.

1060
01:19:06,676 --> 01:19:10,221
Just wanna make sure all you
young ladies are all right in here.

1061
01:19:10,388 --> 01:19:11,681
- Look...
- We're all right.

1062
01:19:11,848 --> 01:19:14,976
...they asked for the jet hours ago.
Now, what are you doing?

1063
01:19:15,143 --> 01:19:18,438
That's being set up.
We'll have you out in a couple of hours.

1064
01:19:18,646 --> 01:19:21,816
- A couple of hours?
- Why not give them what they want?

1065
01:19:21,983 --> 01:19:24,943
They'll get what they want. We
wanna be sure we get what we want.

1066
01:19:25,110 --> 01:19:28,072
That's to get you all out of here safe.

1067
01:19:29,740 --> 01:19:31,075
You two boys too.

1068
01:19:31,366 --> 01:19:32,701
That's close enough.

1069
01:19:36,455 --> 01:19:39,792
Tell the TV to stop saying
there's two homosexuals in here.

1070
01:19:40,918 --> 01:19:42,796
I will, Sal.

1071
01:19:44,798 --> 01:19:46,841
Outside for a minute, Sonny?

1072
01:20:11,991 --> 01:20:13,576
You handle yourself well, Sonny.

1073
01:20:14,035 --> 01:20:18,081
A lot of men would have choked. We
might have had a death on our hands.

1074
01:20:18,331 --> 01:20:20,793
But you handled it. I respect that.

1075
01:20:21,544 --> 01:20:24,588
Now, don't you try to take Sal.
We'll handle him.

1076
01:20:25,548 --> 01:20:29,427
- Just sit tight and you won't get hurt.
- Wait. What are you talking about?

1077
01:20:31,220 --> 01:20:33,055
You just sit quiet.

1078
01:20:34,598 --> 01:20:36,392
We'll handle Sal.

1079
01:20:39,561 --> 01:20:42,397
You think I'd sell him out, you fuck?

1080
01:20:59,290 --> 01:21:00,833
What'd he say?

1081
01:21:03,085 --> 01:21:05,129
He was just talking
about arrangements.

1082
01:21:05,296 --> 01:21:08,299
I talked to him about the TV, Sal.
It's gonna be all right.

1083
01:21:09,175 --> 01:21:10,217
That's all?

1084
01:21:11,135 --> 01:21:12,428
Yeah.

1085
01:21:13,929 --> 01:21:16,140
Why couldn't he say that in here?

1086
01:21:17,183 --> 01:21:21,854
I don't know. He wanted to show me
how the bus is coming in.

1087
01:21:32,783 --> 01:21:33,825
What's the matter?

1088
01:21:35,035 --> 01:21:37,162
Somebody get a glass of water.

1089
01:21:39,414 --> 01:21:41,124
Got a hankie?

1090
01:21:42,375 --> 01:21:43,543
They poisoned the pizza.

1091
01:21:43,752 --> 01:21:47,380
It's not the pizza.
He's got diabetes.

1092
01:21:48,340 --> 01:21:52,009
He had some Coke before.
Don't give him anything. I'll hold it.

1093
01:21:52,760 --> 01:21:55,805
What can we do for you,
Mr. Mulvaney? Tell us.

1094
01:22:00,601 --> 01:22:02,770
Is there a doctor out here?

1095
01:22:05,898 --> 01:22:07,984
We need a doctor in here.

1096
01:22:10,821 --> 01:22:12,364
We need a doctor.

1097
01:22:14,699 --> 01:22:16,743
- What's wrong?
- The manager, he's diabetic.

1098
01:22:16,910 --> 01:22:18,495
He don't look good.

1099
01:22:32,175 --> 01:22:33,718
I gotta search you.

1100
01:22:37,305 --> 01:22:39,433
Watch out he don't kiss you, doc.

1101
01:22:40,809 --> 01:22:43,061
Looking for an antonym.

1102
01:22:44,981 --> 01:22:46,399
Okay.

1103
01:22:52,321 --> 01:22:53,656
Just him.

1104
01:22:55,074 --> 01:22:56,451
Sonny.

1105
01:22:57,744 --> 01:23:01,580
I've convinced Leon to talk to you.
He's on the phone now.

1106
01:23:15,260 --> 01:23:16,803
He's coming on.

1107
01:23:25,521 --> 01:23:26,606
Hello.

1108
01:23:27,690 --> 01:23:29,067
<i>Hello?</i>

1109
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:30,818
<i>Hello, Leon?</i>

1110
01:23:31,235 --> 01:23:33,780
Hello. Hello, Sonny.

1111
01:23:34,363 --> 01:23:35,740
What happened?

1112
01:23:35,907 --> 01:23:38,076
How you...? How you doing?

1113
01:23:38,534 --> 01:23:41,454
Well, I'm out of the hospital.

1114
01:23:41,621 --> 01:23:45,124
Yeah, I know. You know,
I thought you'd never get out.

1115
01:23:46,250 --> 01:23:49,337
Hot. I never thought
I'd get out this way, I'll tell you.

1116
01:23:49,629 --> 01:23:51,047
Yeah.

1117
01:23:51,547 --> 01:23:53,174
So how you doing?

1118
01:23:55,134 --> 01:23:57,471
<i>- I'm a little shaky.
- Oh, yeah?</i>

1119
01:23:57,638 --> 01:24:01,016
Moretti told me that you were
all drugged up...

1120
01:24:02,017 --> 01:24:06,688
...so I figured that's why you didn't
talk to me. I was wondering why.

1121
01:24:06,855 --> 01:24:08,607
It was really terrible, you know?

1122
01:24:08,857 --> 01:24:12,111
I mean, you walk in, and right away
they say you're crazy.

1123
01:24:12,277 --> 01:24:14,862
And then they start sticking
things in your arm.

1124
01:24:15,613 --> 01:24:19,867
I mean, how do they expect you to get
uncrazy if you're asleep all the time?

1125
01:24:21,369 --> 01:24:25,206
I'm... I'm just starting
to come out of it now.

1126
01:24:25,373 --> 01:24:29,001
<i>- So...
- So how are you?</i>

1127
01:24:29,293 --> 01:24:30,628
I'm fine.

1128
01:24:32,798 --> 01:24:34,508
This is something, huh?

1129
01:24:39,388 --> 01:24:41,056
<i>Yeah, yeah.</i>

1130
01:24:41,223 --> 01:24:44,726
I don't know, Leon, you know?
I'm dying here.

1131
01:24:45,018 --> 01:24:46,687
I'm dying.

1132
01:24:48,355 --> 01:24:51,567
Don't you ever listen to yourself
when you say you're dying?

1133
01:24:51,817 --> 01:24:54,945
<i>- Did you ever listen to yourself?
- What are you talking...?</i>

1134
01:24:55,195 --> 01:24:58,699
What do you mean, what am I
talking about? You're dying.

1135
01:24:58,907 --> 01:25:02,828
Do you know that you say that
to me every day? "I'm dying."

1136
01:25:02,995 --> 01:25:05,956
You're not dying.
You're killing the people around you.

1137
01:25:06,206 --> 01:25:09,669
Leon, don't give me that shit.
I don't need the deep shit now!

1138
01:25:09,919 --> 01:25:12,380
You don't realize what
the things you do mean.

1139
01:25:12,630 --> 01:25:15,133
Yeah? I know what I do.

1140
01:25:15,592 --> 01:25:17,302
<i>You stick a gun
to somebody's head.</i>

1141
01:25:17,552 --> 01:25:21,264
<i>- I don't know what I'm doing sometimes.
- Obviously, you don 't.</i>

1142
01:25:21,514 --> 01:25:23,808
"Go to sleep
so it won't hurt when I shoot."

1143
01:25:24,726 --> 01:25:27,352
<i>What do you think
I've been doing in the hospital?</i>

1144
01:25:27,561 --> 01:25:30,230
I take a handful of pills
to get away from you.

1145
01:25:30,397 --> 01:25:32,024
<i>- Right?
- Yeah.</i>

1146
01:25:32,191 --> 01:25:34,735
So now I'm talking to you
on the phone again, right?

1147
01:25:34,985 --> 01:25:37,696
I... I... I got no job.
I don't have friends.

1148
01:25:37,946 --> 01:25:40,616
I can't live.
I have to live with people.

1149
01:25:42,493 --> 01:25:44,370
This death business, I'm sorry.

1150
01:25:44,621 --> 01:25:47,749
I don't know what I'm getting here
with that shit.

1151
01:25:47,916 --> 01:25:52,087
You know, what am I supposed
to say to that shit? This is going on.

1152
01:25:52,337 --> 01:25:54,798
<i>- And you're giving me that shit.
- I'm sorry.</i>

1153
01:25:55,006 --> 01:25:56,716
You know what's happening with me.

1154
01:25:56,966 --> 01:25:59,594
You know the pressures
I've been having, right?

1155
01:25:59,844 --> 01:26:03,139
I got all these pressures. You know it.
You're in that hospital...

1156
01:26:03,389 --> 01:26:06,559
...with them tubes coming out
and want that operation, right?

1157
01:26:06,768 --> 01:26:09,395
You're giving me that shit.
Everybody's giving me shit.

1158
01:26:09,562 --> 01:26:14,317
Everybody needs money.
So you needed money? I got you money.

1159
01:26:14,567 --> 01:26:18,321
- I didn't ask you to rob a bank!
- I know you didn't ask me.

1160
01:26:18,488 --> 01:26:22,660
Look, I'm not putting this
on anybody, you know?

1161
01:26:22,910 --> 01:26:25,871
Nothing on nobody.
I did this on my own. You see?

1162
01:26:26,122 --> 01:26:29,333
All on my own, I did it.
But I just want you to know something.

1163
01:26:29,500 --> 01:26:32,670
I want you to know
that I'm getting out of here.

1164
01:26:32,920 --> 01:26:35,047
I'm getting a plane out of here...

1165
01:26:35,214 --> 01:26:39,134
...and I just wanted you to know it.
And I wanted you to come down...

1166
01:26:39,384 --> 01:26:42,345
...and I wanted to just say
goodbye to you.

1167
01:26:42,595 --> 01:26:45,890
Or, if you wanted to,
you can come with me.

1168
01:26:46,141 --> 01:26:48,810
You're free to do what you want.
That's just what...

1169
01:26:49,060 --> 01:26:50,979
<i>... I wanted to say to you, that's all.</i>

1170
01:26:53,148 --> 01:26:55,483
<i>- I'm... I'm free to do what I want, huh?
- Right.</i>

1171
01:26:55,734 --> 01:27:00,531
I been trying to get away from you for
months and I'm going with you on a trip?

1172
01:27:00,781 --> 01:27:02,783
Where? Where are you going?

1173
01:27:03,200 --> 01:27:07,121
I don't know where yet.
We said Algeria. I don't know.

1174
01:27:07,371 --> 01:27:09,415
So I'll go to Algeria.
I don't know yet.

1175
01:27:09,665 --> 01:27:12,209
Why are you going to Algeria?

1176
01:27:13,836 --> 01:27:16,839
I don't know why. They got
a Howard Johnson's there.

1177
01:27:17,006 --> 01:27:19,925
Your chances... You're warped, you
know? You're really warped.

1178
01:27:20,134 --> 01:27:22,553
<i>I'm warped. I know I'm warped.</i>

1179
01:27:22,845 --> 01:27:25,431
God, Algeria. It's...

1180
01:27:27,975 --> 01:27:31,312
You know, they walk around
with masks on, things on their heads.

1181
01:27:31,562 --> 01:27:34,733
<i>- They're a bunch of crazy people.
- What am I supposed to do?</i>

1182
01:27:34,983 --> 01:27:38,111
<i>- You could have picked a better place.
- Like where?</i>

1183
01:27:38,361 --> 01:27:40,530
<i>Sweden? Denmark?</i>

1184
01:27:42,616 --> 01:27:44,910
Yeah, like that. Yeah.

1185
01:27:46,703 --> 01:27:49,831
You know what?
Sal wanted to go to Wyoming.

1186
01:27:50,082 --> 01:27:54,126
I had to tell him it's not a country.
He don't know where Wyoming is.

1187
01:27:54,460 --> 01:27:58,047
I'm with a guy who don't know where
Wyoming is. Think you got problems?

1188
01:28:01,550 --> 01:28:03,302
So, Sal is with you?

1189
01:28:03,552 --> 01:28:07,014
<i>Oh, boy.
You'd be better off giving up.</i>

1190
01:28:08,057 --> 01:28:11,394
I'm not giving up, because
why have I done this so far?

1191
01:28:11,645 --> 01:28:15,440
I've gone so far with this,
and why should I give up now?

1192
01:28:15,941 --> 01:28:17,526
I can't give up.

1193
01:28:20,362 --> 01:28:24,116
<i>- Would you do me a favor then?
- Yeah, what?</i>

1194
01:28:26,451 --> 01:28:30,664
These guys that have me
down here, you know...

1195
01:28:31,415 --> 01:28:34,751
...they think I'm part of the plot
to rob the bank.

1196
01:28:34,918 --> 01:28:37,963
That's crazy, Leon. That's crazy.

1197
01:28:38,130 --> 01:28:40,590
They're bullshitting you,
giving you a snow job.

1198
01:28:40,841 --> 01:28:43,468
<i>- They told me I was an accessory.
- No.</i>

1199
01:28:43,718 --> 01:28:46,472
<i>That's just a con job on you.
Don 't listen to that.</i>

1200
01:28:46,722 --> 01:28:50,768
I have to listen to it.
I can't survive in prison, Sonny.

1201
01:28:50,935 --> 01:28:53,646
<i>- Leon, you're not going to prison.
- How do you know?</i>

1202
01:28:53,896 --> 01:28:55,731
Because I know. Believe me.

1203
01:28:55,898 --> 01:28:58,276
<i>- Look, please, just tell them.
- Please what?</i>

1204
01:28:58,568 --> 01:28:59,986
Tell them what?

1205
01:29:00,236 --> 01:29:04,197
That you didn't do it?
Are they on the phone now?

1206
01:29:04,364 --> 01:29:06,658
- Are they on the phone now?
- Yeah.

1207
01:29:06,950 --> 01:29:09,578
That's great, Leon.
That's really terrific.

1208
01:29:09,870 --> 01:29:12,414
<i>You talk to me with them on the phone.
Really smart.</i>

1209
01:29:12,664 --> 01:29:14,541
<i>- I have no choice!
- What do you mean?</i>

1210
01:29:14,791 --> 01:29:18,712
What am I supposed to do? There's
7,000 fucking cops all around me.

1211
01:29:18,962 --> 01:29:20,923
<i>- Who's on now?
- Look, don 't lay it on me!</i>

1212
01:29:21,174 --> 01:29:24,218
I'm not, but you knew
that was going on, right?

1213
01:29:24,469 --> 01:29:26,429
<i>You knew what was happening, right?</i>

1214
01:29:26,679 --> 01:29:27,930
Yeah!

1215
01:29:28,181 --> 01:29:30,391
I wanna know
who's on the phone now.

1216
01:29:32,685 --> 01:29:34,812
Moretti. Moretti, is that you?

1217
01:29:36,355 --> 01:29:37,857
<i>Hello.</i>

1218
01:29:39,817 --> 01:29:42,987
Will somebody talk to me?
Somebody gonna talk to me or what?

1219
01:29:43,237 --> 01:29:46,407
- They on the phone now?
- They won't talk to you.

1220
01:29:47,158 --> 01:29:50,995
All right. He didn't do it, okay?
He had nothing to do with it.

1221
01:29:52,371 --> 01:29:55,124
<i>All right. Now, will you get
the fuck off the phone?</i>

1222
01:29:55,291 --> 01:29:56,876
Are they off the phone?

1223
01:30:00,422 --> 01:30:01,465
Yeah.

1224
01:30:01,632 --> 01:30:05,094
Terrific. That really convinced them.
That's what they wanted to know.

1225
01:30:05,260 --> 01:30:07,304
- Did I do it for you?
- Yeah, thank...

1226
01:30:07,471 --> 01:30:08,639
- Thank you very much.
- Okay.

1227
01:30:10,682 --> 01:30:12,810
So now what?
What are you gonna do?

1228
01:30:13,435 --> 01:30:15,228
Well, I thought...

1229
01:30:16,604 --> 01:30:18,731
...that I would
go back to the hospital.

1230
01:30:18,981 --> 01:30:23,111
They're really nice there. They
seem like they're trying to help me.

1231
01:30:23,569 --> 01:30:25,655
That's good, then.
You found something.

1232
01:30:26,447 --> 01:30:28,449
Yeah, I don't know if I have or not.

1233
01:30:30,284 --> 01:30:32,537
So are you gonna still
have the operation?

1234
01:30:32,787 --> 01:30:35,290
Yeah. Yeah.

1235
01:30:35,999 --> 01:30:39,128
So then, what am I
supposed to say to you?

1236
01:30:45,634 --> 01:30:46,927
Thanks a lot...

1237
01:30:48,679 --> 01:30:50,180
...and bon voyage.

1238
01:30:51,515 --> 01:30:53,600
Yeah, right.
See you sometime.

1239
01:30:53,809 --> 01:30:56,562
Yeah. I'll see you in my dreams, huh?

1240
01:30:56,812 --> 01:30:58,939
<i>Right, I'll write a song.</i>

1241
01:31:02,359 --> 01:31:06,613
<i>- I don't know. Life's so funny.
- You said a mouthful, sweetheart.</i>

1242
01:31:11,745 --> 01:31:13,747
Well... Goodbye, huh?

1243
01:31:17,375 --> 01:31:18,668
Bye.

1244
01:31:45,069 --> 01:31:46,529
<i>- Yeah.
- Give me... Can I have...?</i>

1245
01:31:46,696 --> 01:31:49,032
<i>- Moretti. Moretti.
- Hey. Hey.</i>

1246
01:31:49,199 --> 01:31:52,243
You cut off the incoming calls.
Can I have a line?

1247
01:31:52,410 --> 01:31:54,871
I wanna talk to my wife
and to my kids.

1248
01:31:55,121 --> 01:31:57,457
<i>He wants an outside line,
is it all right?</i>

1249
01:31:59,042 --> 01:32:02,337
<i>- I want a line.
- Yeah, Sonny, I'm getting it.</i>

1250
01:32:03,338 --> 01:32:06,674
I could call anybody,
they'd put them on the phone.

1251
01:32:07,509 --> 01:32:09,052
The Pope, an astronaut...

1252
01:32:10,386 --> 01:32:12,097
...the wisest of the wise.

1253
01:32:13,348 --> 01:32:15,391
Who do I have to call?

1254
01:32:17,519 --> 01:32:19,813
I just don't know what to do.

1255
01:32:26,862 --> 01:32:28,656
<i>- Hello.
- Angie.</i>

1256
01:32:28,823 --> 01:32:31,367
Sonny, Jesus!
I was watching it on TV.

1257
01:32:31,534 --> 01:32:35,538
<i>- Yeah. So where are the kids?
- I sent them to the neighbors.</i>

1258
01:32:36,205 --> 01:32:39,999
I can't believe. I can't believe.
I mean, it ain't like you.

1259
01:32:40,208 --> 01:32:41,251
I know.

1260
01:32:41,418 --> 01:32:44,212
<i>You've never done anything
like it before in your life.</i>

1261
01:32:44,462 --> 01:32:47,090
I'm dying, you know that?
I'm dying here.

1262
01:32:47,340 --> 01:32:52,011
<i>I blame myself. I notice you been
tense, like something is happening.</i>

1263
01:32:52,262 --> 01:32:55,348
<i>Like that night you're yelling
at the kids like a madman.</i>

1264
01:32:55,598 --> 01:32:57,100
<i>Then you want me to go...</i>

1265
01:32:57,350 --> 01:33:00,062
...on that ride, here
to there, full of those kids.

1266
01:33:00,312 --> 01:33:03,691
It's ridiculous. I'm not about to go,
so you yell at me:

1267
01:33:03,941 --> 01:33:08,237
"You pig, get on the fucking ride!"
Everything fell out of me.

1268
01:33:08,487 --> 01:33:11,866
<i>My heart, my liver just fell to the floor.
I mean, everything.</i>

1269
01:33:12,116 --> 01:33:16,746
You know what it felt like? You yelling
at me in front of all those people?

1270
01:33:16,996 --> 01:33:19,290
<i>You never talked to me
like that before, Sonny.</i>

1271
01:33:19,540 --> 01:33:22,293
I think, "He's gonna shoot me,
dump my body in the river."

1272
01:33:22,460 --> 01:33:25,045
- Will you just shut up.
- I was scared of you!

1273
01:33:25,421 --> 01:33:29,884
Will you shut the fuck up and
listen to me?! Just listen to me!

1274
01:33:30,134 --> 01:33:32,428
You see that?
With the language and everything.

1275
01:33:32,678 --> 01:33:35,056
I'm trying to talk to you, and you...

1276
01:33:35,307 --> 01:33:37,058
A person can't communicate with you!

1277
01:33:37,309 --> 01:33:40,979
I mean, what am I here?
I'm your wife. I'm your wife!

1278
01:33:41,980 --> 01:33:44,357
You know something?
You hurt me.

1279
01:33:44,608 --> 01:33:48,320
You hurt me, you know that?
Can you imagine, marrying another man?

1280
01:33:49,321 --> 01:33:51,406
<i>Did I ever do anything
to make you do that?</i>

1281
01:33:51,656 --> 01:33:54,492
<i>Did I ever turn you down or anything?</i>

1282
01:33:54,742 --> 01:33:56,535
I know I let myself get fat.

1283
01:33:56,786 --> 01:33:59,997
<i>- Don't call yourself fat.
- You can 't stand me to say it.</i>

1284
01:34:00,247 --> 01:34:04,293
Like I can't stand you being
a bank robber. That's what love is.

1285
01:34:04,460 --> 01:34:06,837
Yeah? You know what love is, right?

1286
01:34:07,088 --> 01:34:10,509
If you know what love is so much,
why didn't you come down here?

1287
01:34:10,759 --> 01:34:14,763
- Well...
- Talk to me about love, go ahead.

1288
01:34:15,764 --> 01:34:17,224
Sonny, I'm scared.

1289
01:34:17,474 --> 01:34:20,310
I'm scared. Are they
gonna shoot me or something?

1290
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:21,978
They're not gonna shoot you!

1291
01:34:22,229 --> 01:34:26,149
<i>You should see it on the TV.
They got cannons, machine guns.</i>

1292
01:34:26,399 --> 01:34:28,443
They're after me, Angie, not you.

1293
01:34:28,652 --> 01:34:30,654
It's late already
by the time I find out...

1294
01:34:30,904 --> 01:34:34,658
<i>... it's just you and Sal. I can 't
get a babysitter! What'll I do?</i>

1295
01:35:05,897 --> 01:35:10,735
Listen, I think I better take him back
for a cardiac check.

1296
01:35:21,163 --> 01:35:23,833
So, what's the matter?
What, he gonna die or what?

1297
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:29,213
No, no. It's just a precautionary
measure. It's awfully warm in here.

1298
01:35:42,018 --> 01:35:44,937
All right, then. Let's go,
let him out.

1299
01:35:45,188 --> 01:35:47,231
I'm not going. I'm okay.

1300
01:35:48,107 --> 01:35:49,901
I just needed the injection.

1301
01:35:50,151 --> 01:35:54,405
What, you trying to be a hero?
You don't look good. We'll let you out.

1302
01:35:54,655 --> 01:35:56,741
I'm not trying to be anything.

1303
01:35:57,325 --> 01:35:59,286
I just wanna be left alone.

1304
01:35:59,453 --> 01:36:01,038
Okay?

1305
01:36:01,580 --> 01:36:04,708
- No one's bothering you.
- I wish to fuck you never came.

1306
01:36:06,085 --> 01:36:07,419
That's all.

1307
01:36:07,586 --> 01:36:10,964
Don't try to act like
you're some angel of human kindness.

1308
01:36:16,428 --> 01:36:21,224
Out of the closet and into the streets!
Out of the closet and into the streets!

1309
01:36:24,644 --> 01:36:29,190
Out of the closet and into the streets!
Out of the closet and into the streets!

1310
01:36:38,826 --> 01:36:42,329
Sonny all the way!
Sonny all the way!

1311
01:36:42,496 --> 01:36:45,707
Sonny all the way!
Sonny all the way!

1312
01:36:45,874 --> 01:36:49,753
Sonny all the way!
Sonny all the way!

1313
01:37:19,159 --> 01:37:20,744
Ladies.

1314
01:37:22,078 --> 01:37:23,580
Ladies.

1315
01:37:24,998 --> 01:37:28,460
I wanna apologize
for my use of language back there.

1316
01:37:28,834 --> 01:37:31,670
Why? What did you say,
Mr. Mulvaney?

1317
01:37:37,968 --> 01:37:40,471
- What did he say?
- He said the 'F' word.

1318
01:37:40,721 --> 01:37:42,306
What? What did he say?

1319
01:37:42,556 --> 01:37:44,057
He said the 'F' word.

1320
01:37:51,191 --> 01:37:52,734
- Fuck.
- I know, Miriam.

1321
01:37:52,901 --> 01:37:54,235
Fuck.

1322
01:37:56,863 --> 01:38:00,700
But I'm a Christian
and my ears are not garbage cans.

1323
01:38:03,119 --> 01:38:04,621
Come on.

1324
01:38:04,788 --> 01:38:07,165
Oh, Edna.

1325
01:38:08,208 --> 01:38:11,127
- Then we shouldn't go after them.
- Then we won't.

1326
01:38:11,795 --> 01:38:13,797
- What's that?
- Sonny.

1327
01:38:14,172 --> 01:38:17,467
Could you come out, please?
Sonny?

1328
01:38:17,634 --> 01:38:19,511
- Shit.
- What?

1329
01:38:19,677 --> 01:38:22,514
- It's my mother.
- Sonny.

1330
01:38:23,057 --> 01:38:25,017
Someone here to see you. Sonny...

1331
01:38:25,184 --> 01:38:29,105
...could you come out, please?
- Oh, who needs this shit?

1332
01:38:29,271 --> 01:38:33,275
Sonny. Sonny,
could you come out, please?

1333
01:38:40,366 --> 01:38:42,700
Mom, what are you doing down here?

1334
01:38:43,868 --> 01:38:46,955
- I don't need you down here.
- Oh, Sonny.

1335
01:38:47,122 --> 01:38:50,417
All of Brooklyn is out here.
Three networks of television.

1336
01:38:50,667 --> 01:38:53,962
- I got it all worked out, Ma.
- I talked to the man from the FBI.

1337
01:38:54,337 --> 01:38:56,172
Who?
No, don't talk to anybody.

1338
01:38:56,339 --> 01:38:59,760
He says if you come out now,
everything is gonna be all right.

1339
01:39:00,010 --> 01:39:03,055
- I'm trying to get you out of this.
- Don't talk to the FBI.

1340
01:39:03,305 --> 01:39:04,557
I told them everything...

1341
01:39:04,807 --> 01:39:09,687
...how you were in the war in Vietnam,
I told them you always had good jobs.

1342
01:39:09,854 --> 01:39:13,065
I told them you were with Goldwater
in '64 in the convention and...

1343
01:39:13,315 --> 01:39:16,235
Listen, I'm getting a plane
and I'm going to Algeria.

1344
01:39:16,485 --> 01:39:18,529
- I'll write you from there.
- Algeria?

1345
01:39:18,696 --> 01:39:20,948
- I gotta get out of here.
- I don't understand.

1346
01:39:21,198 --> 01:39:24,243
If I stay and talk to you,
they won't send the limousine.

1347
01:39:24,493 --> 01:39:28,706
- They'll think I'll come out with you.
- What's the matter with that?

1348
01:39:28,956 --> 01:39:30,791
Because I'm not coming with you.

1349
01:39:31,041 --> 01:39:35,630
The FBI understands everything,
that it is not you that is doing this.

1350
01:39:35,881 --> 01:39:38,842
It's the pressures from your home life!

1351
01:39:39,092 --> 01:39:42,637
- Don't get on Angie now.
- Did I say one word against her?

1352
01:39:42,888 --> 01:39:45,849
You were going to. She has
nothing to do with it, it's me!

1353
01:39:46,099 --> 01:39:49,186
Your life was sweetness and roses.
And you...

1354
01:39:49,352 --> 01:39:53,898
You wouldn't need Leon if Angie
was treating you right, you know that!

1355
01:39:54,148 --> 01:39:57,735
I don't understand why you
wanna sleep with her anyway.

1356
01:39:57,985 --> 01:40:00,279
You got two kids on welfare now.

1357
01:40:00,529 --> 01:40:05,242
- You want three kids on welfare?
- I can't talk to you about this now.

1358
01:40:05,701 --> 01:40:08,037
What are you gonna do?
All right, come out.

1359
01:40:08,287 --> 01:40:11,332
I can't come out. I can't.
Sal is in there with the people.

1360
01:40:11,583 --> 01:40:14,336
- If I come out, he's gonna kill them.
- Oh, my God.

1361
01:40:14,503 --> 01:40:16,171
Run. Run.

1362
01:40:16,421 --> 01:40:19,633
Run? Where am I gonna run?
Ma, I can't run.

1363
01:40:19,883 --> 01:40:22,385
- Maybe...
- There's no maybe. No maybes.

1364
01:40:22,636 --> 01:40:25,555
You gotta go home. Where's Pop?
He didn't come, did he?

1365
01:40:25,806 --> 01:40:29,810
Is he pissed off at you!
He says he doesn't have a son.

1366
01:40:29,976 --> 01:40:32,062
- He says you're dead.
- He's right.

1367
01:40:32,229 --> 01:40:33,480
- No. No.
- Look, Ma...

1368
01:40:33,647 --> 01:40:36,525
...I'm a fuck-up and an outcast
and that's it.

1369
01:40:36,775 --> 01:40:40,153
You come near me, you're
gonna get fucked over and fucked out!

1370
01:40:40,403 --> 01:40:43,323
Now, I gotta go, Ma.
Get her home, okay?

1371
01:40:43,573 --> 01:40:45,033
Just take her home.

1372
01:40:45,283 --> 01:40:47,954
How beautiful you were
when you were a baby.

1373
01:40:48,121 --> 01:40:51,582
Go home now. Get her home now.

1374
01:40:53,084 --> 01:40:54,127
All right.

1375
01:41:01,259 --> 01:41:03,094
<i>Ten minutes.</i>

1376
01:41:18,900 --> 01:41:21,111
Being of sound mind...

1377
01:41:21,736 --> 01:41:23,071
...and body...

1378
01:41:24,198 --> 01:41:25,867
You know, what they...

1379
01:41:36,002 --> 01:41:38,337
To my darling wife...

1380
01:41:39,672 --> 01:41:41,048
...Leon...

1381
01:41:44,719 --> 01:41:46,679
...whom I love...

1382
01:41:50,558 --> 01:41:52,602
...more than any man...

1383
01:41:52,977 --> 01:41:54,937
...has loved another man...

1384
01:41:56,063 --> 01:41:57,982
...in all eternity.

1385
01:42:02,696 --> 01:42:04,072
I leave...

1386
01:42:05,908 --> 01:42:09,453
...$2,700...

1387
01:42:11,413 --> 01:42:15,125
...from my $ 10,000
life insurance policy...

1388
01:42:18,711 --> 01:42:20,630
...to be used...

1389
01:42:22,173 --> 01:42:24,842
...for your sex change operation.

1390
01:42:30,848 --> 01:42:33,976
If there is any money left over...

1391
01:42:36,980 --> 01:42:39,274
...I want it to go to you...

1392
01:42:42,027 --> 01:42:43,862
...at my first...

1393
01:42:45,072 --> 01:42:48,450
At the first anniversary
of my death...

1394
01:42:48,951 --> 01:42:50,869
...at my grave.

1395
01:42:59,920 --> 01:43:01,839
To my wife...

1396
01:43:02,256 --> 01:43:04,174
...to my sweet wife...

1397
01:43:05,342 --> 01:43:06,969
...Angela...

1398
01:43:10,097 --> 01:43:14,227
...$5,000 from the same policy.

1399
01:43:19,149 --> 01:43:21,443
You are the only woman...

1400
01:43:21,609 --> 01:43:23,862
...that I ever loved.

1401
01:43:29,117 --> 01:43:32,286
And I repledge my love to you...

1402
01:43:34,371 --> 01:43:36,415
...in this sad moment.

1403
01:43:44,089 --> 01:43:47,134
To little Kimmy...

1404
01:43:48,177 --> 01:43:49,888
...and Timmy.

1405
01:43:51,514 --> 01:43:53,892
I hope you remember me, Timmy.

1406
01:43:57,312 --> 01:43:59,647
You are the little man
of the family now...

1407
01:44:08,490 --> 01:44:11,785
...and I hope
you look after them for me.

1408
01:44:15,997 --> 01:44:17,791
To my mother...

1409
01:44:21,419 --> 01:44:23,713
...I ask forgiveness.

1410
01:44:28,385 --> 01:44:31,222
You... You don't understand...

1411
01:44:33,599 --> 01:44:35,851
...the things I said...

1412
01:44:36,894 --> 01:44:38,437
...and did.

1413
01:44:41,524 --> 01:44:44,984
But I'm me and I'm different.

1414
01:44:50,865 --> 01:44:53,576
I want a military funeral...

1415
01:44:58,164 --> 01:45:01,752
...and I'm entitled to have one,
free of charge.

1416
01:45:07,550 --> 01:45:10,636
God... God bless you...

1417
01:45:12,054 --> 01:45:14,014
...and watch over you...

1418
01:45:17,726 --> 01:45:20,604
...till we are joined in the hereafter.

1419
01:45:35,119 --> 01:45:38,415
Here, I'll sign.
I'll spell that last name.

1420
01:45:44,045 --> 01:45:46,923
- Watch out!
- Watch out over here.

1421
01:45:47,090 --> 01:45:49,050
Look out over here. Watch it.

1422
01:45:52,971 --> 01:45:54,889
Come on, Sarge, just one picture?

1423
01:46:02,605 --> 01:46:04,607
Back, back!

1424
01:46:07,109 --> 01:46:09,320
All you guys, back up!

1425
01:46:34,012 --> 01:46:36,515
- You're the driver?
- Yeah.

1426
01:46:38,934 --> 01:46:41,019
All right. I wanna check it out.

1427
01:46:45,107 --> 01:46:47,484
- These seats come out?
- No, they're bolted.

1428
01:46:55,410 --> 01:46:58,121
All right, here.
Light me on that side.

1429
01:46:59,622 --> 01:47:01,416
Give me light over there.

1430
01:47:06,754 --> 01:47:08,255
All right.

1431
01:47:14,094 --> 01:47:16,721
Jesus, you're the man, huh?

1432
01:47:17,597 --> 01:47:20,267
I was watching. I saw you, man.

1433
01:47:21,476 --> 01:47:24,479
You should see yourself,
you wouldn't believe it.

1434
01:47:24,855 --> 01:47:28,067
- I believe it.
- Goddamn, Sheila won't believe it.

1435
01:47:28,234 --> 01:47:29,819
- Who's Sheila?
- My old lady.

1436
01:47:30,069 --> 01:47:32,196
They said, "Gas up a stretch...

1437
01:47:32,363 --> 01:47:35,825
...go to 285 Prospect Park West."
- Give me some light over here.

1438
01:47:35,992 --> 01:47:39,537
I said, "Shit, another load
for the massage parlors."

1439
01:47:56,304 --> 01:47:57,346
It's okay.

1440
01:47:57,805 --> 01:47:59,766
My man, I'm gonna remember you.

1441
01:48:07,107 --> 01:48:09,651
This is Agent Murphy.
He'll be your driver.

1442
01:48:09,985 --> 01:48:11,278
No, I want him.

1443
01:48:13,614 --> 01:48:16,617
- Give me the black guy.
- Hey, man, I ain't into that shit.

1444
01:48:16,784 --> 01:48:18,077
Nobody'll hurt you.

1445
01:48:19,161 --> 01:48:22,121
If they would've shot,
they would've shot already.

1446
01:48:22,330 --> 01:48:24,916
- I can't allow that, Sonny.
- You can't allow?

1447
01:48:25,249 --> 01:48:28,628
What makes you think you can
say shit to me? I'm running this.

1448
01:48:29,962 --> 01:48:32,590
I'll pay you. What do you want?
$ 100? $200?

1449
01:48:32,757 --> 01:48:34,425
$ 1,000? Come on.

1450
01:48:35,676 --> 01:48:37,638
Don't look at him, I'm running this.

1451
01:48:38,972 --> 01:48:40,432
Come on.

1452
01:48:42,518 --> 01:48:43,936
Look, it'll be an adventure.

1453
01:48:49,358 --> 01:48:52,486
You men that shoot,
aim for white meat.

1454
01:49:00,911 --> 01:49:02,621
Take a walk.

1455
01:49:03,997 --> 01:49:05,040
Give me him.

1456
01:49:07,334 --> 01:49:10,295
You think you're dealing
with a fucking idiot?

1457
01:49:11,296 --> 01:49:12,673
Take a walk, cop!

1458
01:49:17,804 --> 01:49:21,015
Everybody is a con man. Come on.

1459
01:49:25,270 --> 01:49:27,021
I want everyone across the street.

1460
01:49:28,690 --> 01:49:31,067
I want them all back,
on the sidewalk!

1461
01:49:31,317 --> 01:49:32,734
Let's go!

1462
01:49:33,444 --> 01:49:36,029
At least I know
who I'm dealing with now.

1463
01:49:38,991 --> 01:49:41,452
Here's a pen for you. Come on.

1464
01:49:51,629 --> 01:49:53,506
Don't move, okay?

1465
01:49:57,051 --> 01:50:00,096
Sonny, here's your document.

1466
01:50:01,222 --> 01:50:04,684
- Right.
- Oh, you gotta sign it. Here.

1467
01:50:06,478 --> 01:50:09,564
We're taking off. We're going now.

1468
01:50:10,148 --> 01:50:12,066
Okay, Sal. Where is he? Sal?

1469
01:50:12,859 --> 01:50:14,194
Sal.

1470
01:50:14,360 --> 01:50:16,070
That's it, we're going.

1471
01:50:16,905 --> 01:50:18,990
Here, people, let's go. We're going.

1472
01:50:19,657 --> 01:50:23,369
- Can I get my sweater?
- Get what you had when you came in.

1473
01:50:33,214 --> 01:50:34,673
Sal?

1474
01:50:37,093 --> 01:50:38,427
Sal.

1475
01:50:41,263 --> 01:50:43,390
- How you doing?
- Good.

1476
01:50:43,557 --> 01:50:46,434
- Good? We're gonna do it, right?
- Yeah.

1477
01:50:46,935 --> 01:50:48,812
We're gonna do it. Sal, see...

1478
01:50:49,062 --> 01:50:51,648
...you gotta keep your eye on him.
He's the driver.

1479
01:50:51,898 --> 01:50:54,192
- I need it.
- No, it's mine.

1480
01:50:54,442 --> 01:50:56,653
You gotta keep
your eye on him, Sal, see?

1481
01:51:01,658 --> 01:51:03,536
All right, where am I now?

1482
01:52:01,469 --> 01:52:03,429
All right, hold it. Hold it.

1483
01:52:04,305 --> 01:52:06,056
All right, let's go.

1484
01:52:06,807 --> 01:52:09,560
Swing around now. Swing around.

1485
01:52:10,227 --> 01:52:12,188
Just keep holding hands.

1486
01:52:18,445 --> 01:52:19,821
Hold it.

1487
01:52:21,740 --> 01:52:24,034
Break it on "three."
Not yet, don't break yet.

1488
01:52:24,743 --> 01:52:26,328
One...

1489
01:52:26,620 --> 01:52:28,205
...two...

1490
01:52:28,371 --> 01:52:29,956
...three. Go.
- Go.

1491
01:52:40,926 --> 01:52:43,136
Oh, fuck. We did it.

1492
01:52:43,303 --> 01:52:46,056
- We did it.
- Wish us luck.

1493
01:52:47,474 --> 01:52:48,683
Bye-bye.

1494
01:52:51,020 --> 01:52:53,856
- Okay, you got your one.
- Follow my car.

1495
01:53:06,953 --> 01:53:08,413
Sheldon here, get me Kennedy.

1496
01:53:08,578 --> 01:53:12,833
- Sal, we did it.
- Yeah.

1497
01:53:13,250 --> 01:53:15,585
I'll be a son of a bitch, we did it.

1498
01:53:16,211 --> 01:53:19,214
Okay, let's move.
Come on, honk the horn.

1499
01:53:21,800 --> 01:53:24,094
Hey, Sal, do me a favor, will you?

1500
01:53:24,344 --> 01:53:27,306
Keep the gun pointed up.
We hit a bump, the gun'll go off.

1501
01:53:37,608 --> 01:53:39,569
All right. You set out there?

1502
01:53:42,405 --> 01:53:44,198
We're leaving now.

1503
01:53:44,449 --> 01:53:46,325
We want no trouble en route.

1504
01:53:49,328 --> 01:53:50,621
<i>- Intersection check?
- Check.</i>

1505
01:53:53,332 --> 01:53:56,836
<i>- All right. We'll be starting up right now.
- 10-4.</i>

1506
01:54:28,785 --> 01:54:30,161
It's gonna be all right.

1507
01:54:56,021 --> 01:54:57,523
Sal.

1508
01:54:57,689 --> 01:55:00,859
Sal, you just gotta remember
to keep the gun pointed up.

1509
01:55:24,467 --> 01:55:25,885
You fucking...

1510
01:55:30,181 --> 01:55:32,183
Hey, let him go!

1511
01:57:27,758 --> 01:57:28,968
What's he doing?

1512
01:57:29,343 --> 01:57:31,720
He's still got some
arrangements to make.

1513
01:57:45,235 --> 01:57:47,612
- That's it?
- That's it.

1514
01:57:47,779 --> 01:57:50,574
Sal, see it? There it is.

1515
01:58:47,422 --> 01:58:49,049
Oh, I forgot.

1516
01:58:49,299 --> 01:58:51,426
I forgot to ask if they
got food on board.

1517
01:58:56,265 --> 01:58:57,767
They gonna have food on board?

1518
01:59:04,315 --> 01:59:07,527
There's your jet. We get one more now.
That's the deal.

1519
01:59:07,777 --> 01:59:10,028
Right. Okay, who goes?

1520
01:59:10,570 --> 01:59:12,030
Sylvia?

1521
01:59:13,573 --> 01:59:15,158
Maria.

1522
01:59:23,166 --> 01:59:25,377
I'll pray for you.

1523
01:59:26,211 --> 01:59:27,546
Sal...

1524
01:59:28,005 --> 01:59:30,174
...because this is
your first plane trip...

1525
01:59:30,341 --> 01:59:32,844
...don't be scared, okay?

1526
01:59:46,441 --> 01:59:49,569
I didn't eat all day.
Will there be any food on board?

1527
01:59:49,902 --> 01:59:51,487
There'll be hamburgers. Ready?

1528
01:59:55,074 --> 01:59:56,909
- Sal.
- What?

1529
01:59:57,326 --> 01:59:58,995
Ready to go?

1530
01:59:59,579 --> 02:00:00,913
Yeah.

1531
02:00:05,169 --> 02:00:08,213
Okay. Let's move it.

1532
02:00:09,923 --> 02:00:11,341
Sal...

1533
02:00:12,259 --> 02:00:15,304
...we don't want any accidents
at this point, right?

1534
02:00:15,679 --> 02:00:17,347
You keep your gun pointed up.

1535
02:00:19,683 --> 02:00:21,351
You ready to get out first?

1536
02:00:21,810 --> 02:00:23,186
I'm ready.

1537
02:00:28,316 --> 02:00:29,817
Don't shoot me.

1538
02:00:31,319 --> 02:00:33,946
Quick bullet. Hold it. Hold it.
Hold it, please.

1539
02:00:34,113 --> 02:00:35,615
Okay, it's safe. Come on.

1540
02:00:35,782 --> 02:00:37,617
Put him away, put him away.

1541
02:00:51,965 --> 02:00:55,344
All right, guys, move back.
Come on, back up.

1542
02:01:08,107 --> 02:01:09,566
Now spread them!

1543
02:01:14,446 --> 02:01:17,200
No. No, we're all secure here.

1544
02:01:17,367 --> 02:01:20,120
Murphy will report from the car.

1545
02:01:24,749 --> 02:01:26,418
You make the report.

1546
02:01:26,668 --> 02:01:28,086
Put the gun down.

1547
02:01:28,336 --> 02:01:29,671
Back off.

1548
02:01:30,505 --> 02:01:34,466
Get up now, Sonny.
You're under arrest.

1549
02:01:34,633 --> 02:01:36,844
You have the right to remain silent.

1550
02:01:37,010 --> 02:01:40,722
You have the right to an attorney
during your interrogation.

1551
02:01:40,973 --> 02:01:45,185
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

1552
02:01:45,352 --> 02:01:47,479
If you cannot afford to hire a lawyer...

1553
02:01:47,646 --> 02:01:51,775
...one will be appointed
to represent you if you wish one.

1554
02:02:04,497 --> 02:02:08,084
<i>Agent Sheldon, would you please
remain on the apron...</i>

1555
02:02:08,251 --> 02:02:11,838
<i>... until the hostages are
well inside the terminal?</i>

1556
02:02:12,088 --> 02:02:13,131
<i>Repeat:</i>

1557
02:02:13,339 --> 02:02:16,634
<i>Agent Sheldon, would you please
remain on the apron...</i>

1558
02:02:17,051 --> 02:02:21,306
<i>... until the hostages are
well inside the terminal?</i>

1559
02:02:21,556 --> 02:02:23,892
Yeah, I got you.
We'll hold here.
