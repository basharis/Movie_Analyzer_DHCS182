1
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:52,610
Has it come on?

2
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:55,173
No.

3
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:58,110
Now?

4
00:01:58,751 --> 00:02:00,446
No.

5
00:02:01,654 --> 00:02:02,746
Now?

6
00:02:03,389 --> 00:02:05,152
No.

7
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:07,717
Now?

8
00:02:08,761 --> 00:02:11,059
Turn the damn thing properly!

9
00:02:12,732 --> 00:02:16,099
Welcome to the wrestling area
at the Seoul Olympics.

10
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:18,069
Looking forward to
an exciting match today.

11
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,036
It's come on.

12
00:02:19,205 --> 00:02:20,399
Shall I come down?

13
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:21,574
No.

14
00:02:21,774 --> 00:02:23,332
Stand there holding it.

15
00:02:26,779 --> 00:02:30,180
The final match this Olympics...
in the 72-kilo category,

16
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:34,016
between wrestlers from
Russia and America.

17
00:02:35,121 --> 00:02:36,349
It's really sad that,

18
00:02:36,422 --> 00:02:39,516
despite wrestling being
such a popular sport in India

19
00:02:39,592 --> 00:02:44,052
Indian wrestlers have
disappointed in the Olympics.

20
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:47,024
Even our boys
can bring home medals.

21
00:02:48,134 --> 00:02:50,466
But where is the support?

22
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:53,331
Neither money,
nor facilities.

23
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,800
How will our boys win a medal?

24
00:02:58,111 --> 00:03:01,171
If a medal could be won with words,

25
00:03:02,048 --> 00:03:04,608
you would have won
it a long time ago.

26
00:03:08,421 --> 00:03:10,252
Are you new here?

27
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,717
That's what I thought.

28
00:03:16,996 --> 00:03:19,328
Try stepping into a
wrestling arena someday,

29
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:22,394
you'll run for your life
before the match begins.

30
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:26,636
Looks like you have
done it many times.

31
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,232
Run for your life.

32
00:03:30,743 --> 00:03:34,042
If this were an arena,
then we'd see who would run.

33
00:03:34,747 --> 00:03:37,181
Why do we need an arena?

34
00:03:39,752 --> 00:03:42,277
Now, the moment
we were all waiting for.

35
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:44,752
The stage is all set for a big fight.

36
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:47,692
There's palpable excitement in the air.

37
00:03:49,195 --> 00:03:51,060
Both the wrestlers are walking,

38
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:53,030
for the fight.

39
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:54,726
You are absolutely right, Tom.

40
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:58,328
Looks like it's going
to be an interesting bout.

41
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,063
The crowd seems excited.

42
00:04:03,676 --> 00:04:06,543
The wrestlers come face to face.

43
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,677
Let's see how it plays out.

44
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:13,585
The customary handshake.

45
00:04:13,653 --> 00:04:16,349
The referee's whistle...
and the match begins!

46
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:25,592
He's down!

47
00:04:26,065 --> 00:04:27,032
He's down!

48
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,392
An early thrashing
for the Russian wrestler.

49
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:34,061
Overconfidence can often
prove fatal.

50
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:38,701
Bro, you want to try once more?

51
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,648
Now, the wrestlers are gearing up
for the next round.

52
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:56,320
Yes, Tom, this match doesn't look
as easy as it had seemed.

53
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,691
Let's see what happens now.

54
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:02,561
Both wrestlers testing each other.

55
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:05,297
A great attack!
An equally superb defense.

56
00:05:08,174 --> 00:05:10,438
And that was a magnificent move!

57
00:05:11,377 --> 00:05:13,641
What an amazing move!

58
00:05:14,113 --> 00:05:16,138
He didn't know what hit him.

59
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:20,242
Here's an attack.

60
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,621
And that's a counter-attack!

61
00:05:24,123 --> 00:05:25,351
And it's over!

62
00:05:25,558 --> 00:05:27,048
It's all over.

63
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,287
David has become Goliath,

64
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:31,588
and Goliath has become David here.

65
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:33,158
Well said, Tom.

66
00:05:33,232 --> 00:05:37,635
No one expected such a quick defeat
for the Russian wrestler.

67
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:38,636
What a match!

68
00:05:39,138 --> 00:05:41,003
This is top class wrestling.

69
00:05:43,543 --> 00:05:45,135
You are good.

70
00:05:46,212 --> 00:05:48,305
You've just defeated
a state level champion.

71
00:05:49,215 --> 00:05:50,739
Don't be disheartened buddy,

72
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:54,252
you've just lost to
a national level champion.

73
00:06:04,063 --> 00:06:05,587
Meet my uncle.

74
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:08,059
Mahavir Singh Phogat.

75
00:06:08,634 --> 00:06:11,125
He quit wrestling many years ago,

76
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:15,034
but wrestling hasn't
quit on him.

77
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:28,552
# I'm here to stay. #

78
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:31,317
# Beat the best. #

79
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,985
# I'm here to stay. #

80
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,528
# Beat the best. #

81
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:42,391
# From the mother's womb to the
cemetery, your life is a wrestling bout. #

82
00:06:42,468 --> 00:06:44,993
# So, wrestle, O Wrestler! #

83
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:47,565
# Wrestle, O Wrestler! #

84
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:50,335
# Your glory may rise and fall, #

85
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:53,345
# cause up in the sky
your stars are wrestling, too. #

86
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,438
# So, wrestle, O Wrestler! #

87
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:58,579
# Wrestle, O Wrestler! #

88
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:04,115
# When your heart
thumps with fear, #

89
00:07:04,957 --> 00:07:06,151
# pat your back, #

90
00:07:06,225 --> 00:07:07,419
# bring back courage, #

91
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:09,984
# and you'll be fine. #

92
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:15,428
# Every challenge is
like a crazed elephant, #

93
00:07:15,501 --> 00:07:16,695
# standing in front of you, #

94
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:18,334
# staring fierce, #

95
00:07:18,404 --> 00:07:20,099
# threatening you. #

96
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:23,165
# So, take it head on, #

97
00:07:23,242 --> 00:07:25,733
# that's what you are born for! #

98
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:27,343
# So, wrestle, O Wrestler! #

99
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:30,582
# Wrestle, O Wrestler! #

100
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:34,015
# Your glory may rise and fall, #

101
00:07:34,086 --> 00:07:36,520
# cause up in the sky
your stars are wrestling, too. #

102
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:38,386
# So, wrestle, O Wrestler! #

103
00:07:39,425 --> 00:07:41,154
# Wrestle, O Wrestler! #

104
00:07:59,078 --> 00:08:00,602
The smaller kid will win.

105
00:08:03,082 --> 00:08:04,242
There you go!

106
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:07,950
Merely building a good body
does not make a wrestler.

107
00:08:08,187 --> 00:08:09,279
Come here, kid.

108
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:14,585
Wrestling runs in the blood,
you have to be born with it.

109
00:08:15,194 --> 00:08:17,219
Here. Buy yourself some milk.

110
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:19,222
Bless you.

111
00:08:55,134 --> 00:08:59,366
When there's no food on your plate
what will you eat? Medals?

112
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:03,073
No one gives a damn
about wrestling.

113
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:06,640
Just take up the job
you are being offered.

114
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:15,618
Why did you quit wrestling?

115
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:18,989
I had no choice.

116
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:24,228
Wrestling gave me respect, fame,

117
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:27,357
but it couldn't give me money.

118
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,058
So, I took up this job.

119
00:09:30,102 --> 00:09:33,435
Every wrestler dreams,

120
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:35,736
of bringing honor and
glory to the country.

121
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:40,604
But if the country offers no support,

122
00:09:40,646 --> 00:09:43,342
how far can a wrestler go?

123
00:09:56,629 --> 00:10:02,226
It's not your fault that you
couldn't win a medal for your country.

124
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:07,029
How long will you let these
memories depress you?

125
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:17,409
What I couldn't do,
our son will.

126
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:22,515
He will win gold
for our country.

127
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:27,352
Our flag will fly the highest.

128
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:29,655
Mark my words.

129
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:39,070
That day uncle was
as anxious as a student,

130
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:41,469
whose high school results
were due.

131
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:43,632
Don't worry, brother.

132
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:44,768
It's going to be alright.

133
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:58,380
It's a girl.

134
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:08,094
Uncle was hoping for a boy.

135
00:11:08,634 --> 00:11:09,692
But a girl was born.

136
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:11,025
It's okay.

137
00:11:13,105 --> 00:11:15,437
You have a sister now, Omkar.

138
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:18,003
I was genuinely happy.

139
00:11:18,577 --> 00:11:20,772
But uncle was faking it.

140
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,377
And then it all started.

141
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:27,776
Suddenly everyone in the village
was an expert,

142
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:32,115
in the art of conceiving a boy.

143
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:36,119
Feed a black cow sweets made
with white sesame seeds,

144
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:39,131
wrapped in maize flatbreads,
with your left hand, before sunrise.

145
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:40,427
A son, for sure!

146
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:43,799
Mahavir, here's a special prayer...
for a son.

147
00:11:44,303 --> 00:11:46,737
Recite it daily.

148
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,403
Here... eat this.

149
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:52,267
Eat this!

150
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:54,110
Stop, will you.

151
00:11:56,582 --> 00:11:57,571
Mahavir,

152
00:11:58,084 --> 00:12:00,314
make sure you try only on a Sunday.

153
00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:04,714
On all other days,
reign in your urges.

154
00:12:06,425 --> 00:12:07,619
Got it?

155
00:12:08,994 --> 00:12:10,552
Neither did people stop
giving their advice,

156
00:12:10,596 --> 00:12:12,154
Here you go, son.

157
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:14,456
nor did uncle and aunt
stop acting on them.

158
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:18,733
The day of the delivery arrived
and so did half the village.

159
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:21,101
To take credit for a son.

160
00:12:21,307 --> 00:12:23,298
Geeta, you are going to
have a brother.

161
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:24,501
You can play with him.

162
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,487
It's a girl.

163
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:39,081
But neither did uncle get a son,

164
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,484
nor the villagers, credit.

165
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:44,554
But, in all these
"unfailing techniques",

166
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,493
where did the fault lie?

167
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:51,468
She must have fed a black buffalo
instead of a black cow.

168
00:12:51,637 --> 00:12:54,231
Else, look at my cousin
from Rohtak.

169
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:56,238
She had three healthy boys
in three years.

170
00:12:56,308 --> 00:12:58,640
If you say the prayer in reverse,

171
00:12:58,711 --> 00:13:01,475
the results will also be reversed.

172
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:03,742
Self control is a virtue.

173
00:13:04,183 --> 00:13:08,051
I told him to try only on Sundays.

174
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:11,689
He must have let
the reins free every day.

175
00:13:15,227 --> 00:13:17,218
I couldn't give you a son...

176
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:24,100
It's not your fault.

177
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:27,336
And don't get me wrong.

178
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:32,343
Both, Geeta and Babita
are very dear to me.

179
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:40,444
But only a boy
can fulfil my dream.

180
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,060
Years went by.

181
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,401
Uncle remained adamant,

182
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:03,134
he wanted a boy.

183
00:14:06,745 --> 00:14:09,407
But maybe God was adamant too.

184
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:11,448
The third child was a girl,

185
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:15,076
and so was the fourth.

186
00:14:24,296 --> 00:14:27,493
This time I too was dejected.

187
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:46,046
Food is ready, papa.

188
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:03,667
Turn it over or it'll burn.

189
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:21,710
After that uncle gave up on his
desire for a son, and on his dream too.

190
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,084
Hey, Mahavir Singh-ji!

191
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:29,191
What's wrong with him?

192
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:35,295
Are you coming to watch
the wrestling match this evening?

193
00:15:38,003 --> 00:15:40,062
No. You carry on.

194
00:15:42,574 --> 00:15:43,632
Hey, Mahavir!

195
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:47,303
I've been blessed with a boy.

196
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:49,075
Here... have some sweets.

197
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,094
What happened?

198
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:40,256
Look how badly
they've been thrashed.

199
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:41,495
Say something!

200
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:43,728
Yes, look how badly
they've been thrashed.

201
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:45,530
They're all swollen and bruised.

202
00:16:45,604 --> 00:16:47,299
Yes, they're all swollen and bruised.

203
00:16:49,274 --> 00:16:50,673
Why did you beat them?

204
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:52,107
I didn't, uncle.

205
00:16:52,711 --> 00:16:55,339
Geeta and Babita beat them up.

206
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:09,617
They started it.

207
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:12,391
He called me a loser
and Babita a witch.

208
00:17:12,631 --> 00:17:14,360
So, we gave it to them.

209
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:18,164
They beat them so badly?
For such a trivial reason?

210
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:23,006
Yes, shouldn't have
beaten them so badly.

211
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:25,405
Please forgive them...
they're kids.

212
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:30,072
We are letting go because
they are your girls.

213
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:32,015
Move!

214
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:33,745
Got thrashed by girls!

215
00:17:39,191 --> 00:17:40,180
Come here.

216
00:17:42,594 --> 00:17:43,424
Come here!

217
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:50,260
We won't fight again, papa.

218
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:54,003
First tell me, how did you
manage to do it?

219
00:17:57,576 --> 00:18:00,204
First, he called me a loser
but I remained quiet.

220
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:02,347
But then he called Babita a witch.

221
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:03,071
That was it.

222
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:05,673
I grabbed him and
punched him like this.

223
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:09,010
Then the other guy attacked.

224
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:11,454
I caught his hair
and shoved him down,

225
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:13,718
and dug my elbow in his back.

226
00:18:32,978 --> 00:18:36,641
They say that a twig is enough
to give hope to a drowning man.

227
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:40,183
Here, uncle had found
not one, but two lifeguards!

228
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:55,027
All along, I was desperate for a son,

229
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:58,126
so he could win a gold
for the country.

230
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:04,602
But what didn't occur to me
is that gold is gold.

231
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:07,539
Whether a boy wins it, or a girl.

232
00:19:09,381 --> 00:19:13,283
From now on, Geeta and Babita
will do no household chores.

233
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:18,181
Wrestling is in their blood.

234
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,459
From now on they will only wrestle.

235
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:26,097
Wrestling is for boys.

236
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:28,499
You think our girls are
any lesser than boys?

237
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:31,434
I've never ever seen girls wrestle.

238
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:36,104
What will the villagers say?

239
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:38,699
For how long will they talk?

240
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:44,178
What if the girls break
their hands and legs?

241
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:47,181
We'll fix them.

242
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:51,649
Where will the money come from?

243
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:54,387
I don't know.

244
00:19:58,163 --> 00:20:02,099
Don't ruin the girls' lives
for your passion.

245
00:20:06,572 --> 00:20:09,132
Let me try for a year.

246
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:12,642
For this one year,
you bury your feelings.

247
00:20:15,614 --> 00:20:18,208
If I'm proven wrong,

248
00:20:18,283 --> 00:20:20,774
I'll bury my dream forever.

249
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:35,798
Be ready at 5am tomorrow.

250
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:40,237
Why, papa?

251
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:47,770
I want to feed you
your favourite snack, 'gol gappas'.

252
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:52,614
5am. Okay?

253
00:20:55,153 --> 00:20:57,087
What did you do now?

254
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,724
I thought you did something.

255
00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:05,318
Eat.

256
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:10,725
How is it?

257
00:21:11,503 --> 00:21:13,494
It's a little less spicy, papa.

258
00:21:14,139 --> 00:21:15,697
Alright, make it spicier.

259
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,213
Eat as much as you want right now.

260
00:21:23,682 --> 00:21:28,244
Because from today, you will both
lead the life of a wrestler.

261
00:21:32,724 --> 00:21:36,251
And wrestlers are not allowed,

262
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:39,125
pickled, oily and spicy food,

263
00:21:39,264 --> 00:21:42,256
in fact,
all the food that you most love.

264
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,231
Consider this your last treat.

265
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:01,013
# A messiah for the rest, #

266
00:22:01,386 --> 00:22:03,445
# a terror for your own. #

267
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:05,490
Come on, faster Babita!

268
00:22:05,557 --> 00:22:12,053
# O Papa, don't put us
through this torture! #

269
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:17,464
# A messiah for the rest,
a terror for your own. #

270
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:20,004
Papa, it's difficult to run
in these clothes.

271
00:22:20,205 --> 00:22:25,006
# O Papa, don't put us
through this torture! #

272
00:22:25,644 --> 00:22:30,274
# Don't torture us! #

273
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:36,681
# O Papa! #

274
00:22:39,725 --> 00:22:41,124
# O Papa! #

275
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:53,764
Don't you dare stop!

276
00:22:54,072 --> 00:22:58,441
# O Papa, you are
injurious to our health. #

277
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:03,345
# O Papa, you are
injurious to our health. #

278
00:23:03,615 --> 00:23:05,480
# Have mercy on us, #

279
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:08,348
# we are little children. #

280
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,354
# Have mercy on us, #

281
00:23:10,422 --> 00:23:12,185
# we are little children. #

282
00:23:12,257 --> 00:23:15,249
# So much discipline... #

283
00:23:16,595 --> 00:23:21,294
# So much discipline
makes us want to die. #

284
00:23:21,366 --> 00:23:26,360
# O Papa, you are
injurious to our health. #

285
00:23:26,538 --> 00:23:28,438
# Have mercy on us, #

286
00:23:28,507 --> 00:23:30,600
# we are little children. #

287
00:23:31,209 --> 00:23:33,177
# Have mercy on us, #

288
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:34,576
# we are little children. #

289
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:38,343
# So much discipline... #

290
00:23:39,451 --> 00:23:44,081
# So much discipline
makes us want to die. #

291
00:23:44,156 --> 00:23:49,093
# O Papa, you are
injurious to our health. #

292
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:52,522
Nobody would've ever been
punished so severely,

293
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:55,632
for beating up a couple of boys.

294
00:23:56,535 --> 00:24:01,529
He abused me.
Why did you have to beat him?

295
00:24:03,175 --> 00:24:04,335
Now you tell me!

296
00:24:07,646 --> 00:24:11,480
# You stopped our
picnics and outings. #

297
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:13,484
# This is torture, #

298
00:24:13,552 --> 00:24:16,419
# grave torture! #

299
00:24:16,488 --> 00:24:20,515
# To tell children, not to
enjoy their childhood. #

300
00:24:20,592 --> 00:24:22,685
# This is torture, #

301
00:24:22,761 --> 00:24:25,195
# grave torture! #

302
00:24:30,602 --> 00:24:32,729
# Toffees, games and toys, #

303
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:35,165
# scrumptious foods, #

304
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,367
# have bid us adieu, #

305
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:39,569
# since your scolding. #

306
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:44,081
# This is our time
for fun and games, #

307
00:24:44,382 --> 00:24:48,682
# why is it being measured
by a stopwatch? #

308
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:52,717
# Our luck is like
a broken down car. #

309
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:57,288
# Our luck is like
a broken down car. #

310
00:24:57,529 --> 00:25:00,555
# And our papa... #

311
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:06,503
# And our papa is the
driver of that car. #

312
00:25:06,571 --> 00:25:11,599
# O Papa, you are
injurious to our health. #

313
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:15,510
# You have forbidden us
tasty and spicy food. #

314
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:18,048
# This is torture, #

315
00:25:18,116 --> 00:25:20,380
# grave torture! #

316
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:24,578
# You ask delicate dolls
to toughen up. #

317
00:25:24,656 --> 00:25:27,352
# This is torture, #

318
00:25:27,425 --> 00:25:29,450
# grave torture! #

319
00:25:30,462 --> 00:25:33,488
We'll obey your
every command, mummy.

320
00:25:33,732 --> 00:25:35,666
Just save us
from this wrestling.

321
00:25:35,734 --> 00:25:38,532
For one year forget
that you have a mother.

322
00:25:40,405 --> 00:25:42,339
Hey! Forgot so quickly?

323
00:25:44,142 --> 00:25:45,769
How utterly absurd, Mahavir!

324
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:47,542
Girls in the wrestling arena?

325
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:50,180
Will you have me sin at this age?

326
00:25:53,018 --> 00:25:55,384
# Our childhood has been
thrown away, #

327
00:25:55,487 --> 00:25:57,648
# the garden has lost its blossoms, #

328
00:25:57,722 --> 00:26:01,715
# wonder what kind of
war we prepare for? #

329
00:26:02,127 --> 00:26:06,621
# Day and night, we cry
cascades of tears, #

330
00:26:06,698 --> 00:26:11,362
# you are still not happy, O dictator,
we are your sacrifice. #

331
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:15,666
# Do you think we are so hopeless? #

332
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:19,608
# Do you think we are so hopeless? #

333
00:26:19,678 --> 00:26:24,308
# Better than you, are... #

334
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:28,682
# Better than you,
are Bollywood movie villains. #

335
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:34,191
# O Papa, you are
injurious to our health. #

336
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:36,056
Babita...

337
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:43,192
Will you press my legs please?

338
00:26:43,501 --> 00:26:47,232
I was going to ask you
the same thing.

339
00:27:25,176 --> 00:27:28,009
Always respect Mother Earth.

340
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,410
The more you respect it,

341
00:27:31,583 --> 00:27:33,744
the more respect
you will get in return.

342
00:28:00,979 --> 00:28:04,380
Uncle had managed to bring
Geeta and Babita to the wrestling pit,

343
00:28:04,449 --> 00:28:06,349
but there was something missing.

344
00:28:06,418 --> 00:28:09,546
In order for Geeta and
Babita to train well,

345
00:28:09,721 --> 00:28:12,246
they needed to practice
with good wrestlers.

346
00:28:16,127 --> 00:28:17,287
Omkar?

347
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:19,424
Him?

348
00:28:20,331 --> 00:28:21,093
Y es.

349
00:28:21,499 --> 00:28:23,490
Isn't that too much, brother?

350
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:26,469
It was bad enough that
you were making the girls wrestle.

351
00:28:26,638 --> 00:28:29,072
Now you want
them to fight boys?

352
00:28:30,341 --> 00:28:32,434
Yes or no?

353
00:28:35,447 --> 00:28:38,041
I don't have the heart to say yes.

354
00:28:38,416 --> 00:28:40,145
And, I don't have the courage
to say no.

355
00:28:40,285 --> 00:28:42,378
Okay, then send him over.

356
00:28:49,094 --> 00:28:53,155
Because of you both
I'm caught in the crossfire.

357
00:28:53,465 --> 00:28:55,194
Stop complaining!

358
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,459
You are just caught
in the crossfire.

359
00:28:57,535 --> 00:29:00,026
We've been pushed into war.

360
00:29:00,105 --> 00:29:01,003
Keep running!

361
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:04,371
Why has papa got him
to train with us?

362
00:29:04,442 --> 00:29:06,501
This pint-sized boy is no challenge.

363
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:08,705
He looks like a 'TTSS' to me.

364
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,038
What does that mean?

365
00:29:10,115 --> 00:29:12,106
Tall on Talk, Short on Strength.

366
00:29:16,955 --> 00:29:18,582
'TTSS'... is it?

367
00:29:35,206 --> 00:29:37,333
Go easy, I'm your little sister.

368
00:29:37,475 --> 00:29:38,373
Yes... yes!

369
00:29:48,219 --> 00:29:49,618
Don't mind me saying,

370
00:29:49,988 --> 00:29:51,319
but your girls are a little weak.

371
00:29:51,723 --> 00:29:53,657
Want to fight me?

372
00:29:54,058 --> 00:29:55,423
I'll be right back.

373
00:30:48,046 --> 00:30:50,537
I don't understand your ways.

374
00:30:56,688 --> 00:31:03,992
At one time, I can either be
their coach or their father.

375
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:09,667
When the coach is at work,

376
00:31:11,336 --> 00:31:13,201
the father has to take a backseat.

377
00:31:20,111 --> 00:31:22,136
Sorry for calling you 'TTSS'.

378
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:23,578
Sorry, my foot!

379
00:31:28,453 --> 00:31:30,216
You think this is a joke?

380
00:31:30,788 --> 00:31:33,484
He is throwing you down
and you are letting him?

381
00:31:34,425 --> 00:31:35,289
When he attacks from the left,

382
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,352
why don't you stabilize yourself
on the left and defend?

383
00:31:39,197 --> 00:31:39,788
Sorry, papa.

384
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:42,093
Child, this is wrestling,

385
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,664
three sorrys and the game is over.

386
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:47,034
Come on.

387
00:31:47,105 --> 00:31:48,265
Try again.

388
00:31:56,614 --> 00:31:59,310
Where's the strength in you?

389
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,588
You are training the girls to wrestle,

390
00:32:04,722 --> 00:32:06,314
I didn't say anything.

391
00:32:06,524 --> 00:32:08,617
But I will not allow you to cook
chicken in my kitchen!

392
00:32:08,693 --> 00:32:10,320
Try and understand.

393
00:32:10,461 --> 00:32:12,429
Wrestlers require protein.

394
00:32:12,497 --> 00:32:14,021
I don't care!

395
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:15,725
If meat is cooked in my kitchen,

396
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,297
I will stop eating.

397
00:32:17,368 --> 00:32:19,427
You want your girls
to be weak wrestlers?

398
00:32:19,504 --> 00:32:21,028
I don't know anything.

399
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:23,573
There's no way chicken will be
cooked in my kitchen!

400
00:32:27,145 --> 00:32:28,635
Omkar!
- Yes.

401
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,547
Do you know how to cook?

402
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:31,309
No, uncle.

403
00:32:31,382 --> 00:32:32,713
Then learn.

404
00:32:34,018 --> 00:32:36,282
We don't have enough money
for their current diet.

405
00:32:36,421 --> 00:32:38,252
How can we afford
chicken now?

406
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:41,882
What? Sell you chicken
worth 1 00 rupees for 20?

407
00:32:42,327 --> 00:32:44,261
And I will benefit from this deal?

408
00:32:44,595 --> 00:32:47,462
Why don't you explain the math?

409
00:32:48,333 --> 00:32:52,167
Look, Geeta and Babita will eventually
become famous wrestlers.

410
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:56,171
And when people will find out that
they eat chicken from your shop,

411
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,208
where do you think
they'll buy chicken from?

412
00:32:58,509 --> 00:33:01,000
That makes sense.

413
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:02,171
But just 20 rupees?

414
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:03,472
There are other shops too.

415
00:33:03,548 --> 00:33:04,981
Wait... Iisten.

416
00:33:06,551 --> 00:33:08,416
Let's make it 40.

417
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:10,977
I won't give a dime
more than 25.

418
00:33:24,068 --> 00:33:25,592
I have browned the onions,

419
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:28,999
and now this pot
will not go back in my kitchen.

420
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,352
Now, put the chicken in the pot.

421
00:33:51,262 --> 00:33:54,060
And let it cook on a slow flame.

422
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:06,237
It's to be eaten with rice.

423
00:34:07,412 --> 00:34:09,744
But... it can also be
eaten with bread.

424
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:21,988
Uncle was fulfilling his duty,

425
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,652
and the villagers, theirs.

426
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:26,486
Girls are best suited
for the kitchen,

427
00:34:26,631 --> 00:34:28,155
not for wrestling.

428
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:29,597
Mahavir Singh has gone mad.

429
00:34:30,034 --> 00:34:30,762
Not mad,

430
00:34:31,035 --> 00:34:32,229
he's become shameless.

431
00:34:32,303 --> 00:34:36,569
He's getting the girls to
wear shorts and fight boys.

432
00:34:36,774 --> 00:34:40,676
Since you all started wrestling,
your walk has become very manly.

433
00:34:41,045 --> 00:34:42,672
Wonder what else will happen?

434
00:34:43,114 --> 00:34:46,572
Next, it'll be my fist
and your face.

435
00:34:48,186 --> 00:34:51,587
If only you had
given birth to a boy!

436
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:54,281
Their mother doesn't protest either.

437
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:57,690
The entire village is laughing at us.

438
00:34:57,762 --> 00:35:00,424
Who will marry our girls?

439
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:04,595
I will make our girls so capable,

440
00:35:04,702 --> 00:35:06,693
that boys will not choose them,

441
00:35:06,971 --> 00:35:08,336
they will choose boys!

442
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:14,374
I'm going to tell papa today,
this wrestling isn't working out.

443
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:15,639
Me, too.

444
00:35:15,713 --> 00:35:18,443
B-O-Y... boy.

445
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:22,548
C-A-T... cat.

446
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:26,055
Papa, this wrestling
isn't working out...

447
00:35:26,657 --> 00:35:27,646
for Babita.

448
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,389
Yes, papa... and,

449
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:35,398
Geeta gets so tired
that she falls asleep in class.

450
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:39,535
She can't concentrate
on her studies at all.

451
00:35:40,571 --> 00:35:42,698
Babita's body aches terribly.

452
00:35:43,207 --> 00:35:45,471
She keeps tossing
and turning all night.

453
00:35:45,543 --> 00:35:49,707
In school, girls tease
Geeta by calling her a man.

454
00:35:50,214 --> 00:35:51,203
Sad, isn't it?

455
00:35:52,717 --> 00:35:55,379
None of these
seem like a problem.

456
00:35:55,753 --> 00:35:57,744
Tell me if there is
a real problem.

457
00:35:58,256 --> 00:35:58,722
Read.

458
00:35:58,789 --> 00:36:02,691
E-L-E-P-H-A-N-T

459
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,327
Papa, our hair is getting ruined
because of wrestling in the mud.

460
00:36:07,532 --> 00:36:09,159
She even has lice.

461
00:36:09,567 --> 00:36:11,660
I killed eight this evening.

462
00:36:16,574 --> 00:36:18,007
Now, that's a real problem.

463
00:36:20,044 --> 00:36:22,478
Okay, be ready tomorrow at 5am.

464
00:36:26,217 --> 00:36:27,149
Papa, please.

465
00:36:27,218 --> 00:36:28,515
We don't have any problem.

466
00:36:28,586 --> 00:36:30,451
In fact, we are enjoying it.

467
00:36:30,621 --> 00:36:32,418
Please don't cut our hair.

468
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:34,458
We will do as you say.

469
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:36,186
Ma, say something.

470
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:37,693
Look what papa is doing.

471
00:36:37,762 --> 00:36:39,525
Please don't cut our hair, papa.

472
00:36:39,597 --> 00:36:41,588
We'll do whatever you say.

473
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:43,724
We'll wake up in the morning!

474
00:36:44,001 --> 00:36:45,434
Do everything...
won't ever complain.

475
00:36:45,503 --> 00:36:47,596
Just don't cut our hair, please.

476
00:36:47,672 --> 00:36:49,037
Please, papa.

477
00:36:50,608 --> 00:36:51,575
Cut it.

478
00:36:52,109 --> 00:36:52,734
Cut it?

479
00:36:53,778 --> 00:36:55,336
Can you grow it?

480
00:36:57,315 --> 00:36:58,577
Then cut it.

481
00:38:24,368 --> 00:38:26,336
Getting them to wrestle
was still okay,

482
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:29,132
but it's cruel to chop their hair off!

483
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:31,298
They are girls, after all.

484
00:38:31,742 --> 00:38:35,200
Whatever I'm doing
is for their best.

485
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:38,480
Anything that distracts them
from wrestling,

486
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:39,741
I will get rid of!

487
00:38:41,752 --> 00:38:44,721
"ls that the full moon or the sun!"

488
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:47,981
I'm confused... today both
seem to have risen together.

489
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,027
Let it go, Babita.

490
00:38:51,195 --> 00:38:53,425
Our stars are to blame.

491
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:00,334
Enough of wrestling,

492
00:39:01,372 --> 00:39:03,101
now, it's time for a street-fight!

493
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:07,539
And then, in a small village
of Haryana called Balali,

494
00:39:07,978 --> 00:39:10,003
a grand rebellion began.

495
00:39:10,448 --> 00:39:15,511
Revolutionaries Geeta and Babita
versus dictator Mahavir Singh.

496
00:39:16,554 --> 00:39:20,388
All of uncle's arsenal
were neutralized one by one.

497
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:25,150
The alarm clock was
cleverly misguided.

498
00:39:39,677 --> 00:39:41,645
What happened, papa?

499
00:39:42,613 --> 00:39:44,205
You are late today.

500
00:39:44,648 --> 00:39:46,115
Age is catching up.

501
00:39:46,484 --> 00:39:47,451
No problem.

502
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:49,677
We've finished today's training.

503
00:39:49,987 --> 00:39:51,352
Come, Babita.

504
00:39:57,495 --> 00:40:01,158
Countless light-bulbs were martyred.

505
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,391
How come the bulb fuses everyday?

506
00:40:04,602 --> 00:40:05,660
Quality... papa,

507
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,230
quality!

508
00:40:07,671 --> 00:40:10,606
Injury was made an ally.

509
00:40:12,376 --> 00:40:16,278
In the battlefield, surrender
was given without a fight.

510
00:40:18,482 --> 00:40:19,346
Should I give it to you?

511
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:21,749
And uncle, despite having both hands,

512
00:40:22,052 --> 00:40:25,283
felt helpless like the armless character
from the film 'Sholay'.

513
00:40:25,322 --> 00:40:27,085
Get out of here!

514
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:32,289
I couldn't understand how
I had suddenly become so strong.

515
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:35,565
But uncle understood very well
why Geeta and Babita,

516
00:40:35,633 --> 00:40:38,363
had suddenly become so weak.

517
00:40:39,236 --> 00:40:43,332
Geeta and Babita thought
that they had won the war.

518
00:40:43,407 --> 00:40:44,374
Hey!

519
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:48,178
Are you going to Sunita's wedding?

520
00:40:48,345 --> 00:40:49,778
M... mummy.

521
00:40:50,181 --> 00:40:52,149
Are you trying to embarrass me?

522
00:40:53,217 --> 00:40:54,582
Choose one.

523
00:40:55,052 --> 00:40:56,144
This one.

524
00:41:03,994 --> 00:41:05,393
Let me see.

525
00:41:07,731 --> 00:41:11,223
Finally,
my girls are looking like girls.

526
00:41:14,405 --> 00:41:16,396
Don't tell papa.

527
00:41:16,674 --> 00:41:18,505
Come home before 8pm.

528
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:25,638
# I arrive, the blushing bride. #

529
00:41:26,083 --> 00:41:29,519
# I arrive, the blushing bride. #

530
00:41:29,687 --> 00:41:33,453
# Shy... nervous. #

531
00:41:33,724 --> 00:41:37,182
# I arrive, the blushing bride. #

532
00:41:50,107 --> 00:41:53,804
# I've seen many weird things
in my life, #

533
00:41:54,078 --> 00:41:57,275
# but my groom is
the weirdest of the lot. #

534
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:05,285
# I've seen many weird things
in my life, #

535
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:08,651
# but my groom is
the weirdest of the lot. #

536
00:42:09,159 --> 00:42:15,530
# Marrying me to him is like
casting pearls before swine. #

537
00:42:15,666 --> 00:42:19,193
# My groom is such a loser. #

538
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:23,099
# My groom is a loser. #

539
00:42:23,407 --> 00:42:27,070
# My groom is such a loser. #

540
00:42:40,324 --> 00:42:44,124
# I told my groom,
help me freshen up, #

541
00:42:44,295 --> 00:42:47,628
# get me a toothbrush
from the store. #

542
00:42:47,798 --> 00:42:51,598
# But instead of a toothbrush, #

543
00:42:51,802 --> 00:42:54,327
# he got me sugarcane
from the fields. #

544
00:42:54,471 --> 00:42:56,371
# What a loser! #

545
00:42:58,375 --> 00:42:59,603
# Such a loser! #

546
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:05,647
# My groom is such a loser. #

547
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:09,416
# My groom is a loser. #

548
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:13,519
# My groom is such a loser. #

549
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:37,175
- Let it go, brother.

550
00:43:37,247 --> 00:43:38,714
- He is crazy.

551
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:55,788
We missed training
just for a day.

552
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,597
What was the need to create
such a big scene?

553
00:44:02,072 --> 00:44:05,200
What kind of father forces
his daughters to become wrestlers?

554
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:08,672
Makes them wake up at 5am to run.

555
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:11,114
Works them like slaves.

556
00:44:11,181 --> 00:44:12,671
Makes them fight boys.

557
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:15,548
And if they protest,
he cuts their hair.

558
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:19,052
May God never give
anyone such a father.

559
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:24,984
I wish God had given me
such a father.

560
00:44:30,567 --> 00:44:34,435
At least your father
thinks about you.

561
00:44:36,407 --> 00:44:39,171
Otherwise, our reality is,

562
00:44:39,376 --> 00:44:41,173
the moment a girl is born,

563
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:43,745
teach her to cook and clean,

564
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:46,342
make her do
all the household chores.

565
00:44:48,585 --> 00:44:50,450
And, once she turns 14,

566
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:53,580
marry her off.

567
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:56,784
Get rid of the "burden"!

568
00:44:58,395 --> 00:45:00,727
And hand her over to a man,

569
00:45:01,965 --> 00:45:03,728
whom she has never seen before.

570
00:45:05,602 --> 00:45:07,729
Make her bear children
and raise them.

571
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:10,537
That's all she's good for.

572
00:45:11,108 --> 00:45:14,339
At least your father
considers you his child.

573
00:45:14,745 --> 00:45:16,508
He is fighting against
the whole world.

574
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:19,310
He is silently tolerating
their taunts.

575
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:20,574
Why?

576
00:45:22,453 --> 00:45:26,287
So that the two of you
can have a future... a life.

577
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:29,090
What is he doing wrong?

578
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:38,151
# I'm here to stay. #

579
00:46:38,328 --> 00:46:40,660
# Beat the best. #

580
00:46:41,098 --> 00:46:43,532
# I'm here to stay. #

581
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,534
# Beat the best. #

582
00:46:46,069 --> 00:46:51,268
# When fortune gives you
a chance to prove yourself, #

583
00:46:51,441 --> 00:46:56,606
# You have barely
a handful of days to prepare. #

584
00:46:56,680 --> 00:47:01,982
# It asks in exchange
every drop of your sweat. #

585
00:47:02,219 --> 00:47:07,452
# Know for sure
you gain so much more. #

586
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:19,163
# Fortune bows before
your intense effort. #

587
00:47:19,236 --> 00:47:21,136
# So, wrestle, O Wrestler! #

588
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:23,632
# Wrestle, O Wrestler! #

589
00:47:25,075 --> 00:47:28,010
That day, one fact
became clear to me.

590
00:47:28,312 --> 00:47:30,405
Don't know about Geeta and Babita,

591
00:47:30,581 --> 00:47:33,379
but I sure didn't have
wrestling in my blood.

592
00:47:35,652 --> 00:47:37,745
Look at him sulk.

593
00:47:39,056 --> 00:47:40,489
Give him some butter, ma.

594
00:47:40,591 --> 00:47:42,559
He's become so weak.

595
00:47:44,761 --> 00:47:47,229
I lost intentionally to
make you happy.

596
00:47:47,331 --> 00:47:48,525
Get lost... 'TTSS'!

597
00:47:48,599 --> 00:47:50,624
"Lost intentionally..."

598
00:47:51,568 --> 00:47:52,660
Don't worry.

599
00:47:52,769 --> 00:47:54,464
It'll remain between us.

600
00:47:54,571 --> 00:47:56,163
After all, you are family.

601
00:47:56,273 --> 00:47:58,298
Your reputation is ours, too.

602
00:47:58,375 --> 00:47:59,637
Don't get so cocky.

603
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:00,675
Watch me tomorrow.

604
00:48:00,744 --> 00:48:02,939
You won't be able to tomorrow.

605
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:06,675
No, uncle. Tomorrow, I will
definitely put up a tough fight.

606
00:48:07,017 --> 00:48:08,382
We are going
to Rohtak tomorrow.

607
00:48:09,486 --> 00:48:11,716
For a wrestling competition.

608
00:48:16,126 --> 00:48:19,220
But, I am not ready for
a wrestling competition yet.

609
00:48:19,596 --> 00:48:21,655
Who is talking about you?

610
00:48:28,272 --> 00:48:29,603
She will fight boys?

611
00:48:30,307 --> 00:48:32,172
She won't last
two minutes, uncle.

612
00:48:32,276 --> 00:48:33,300
Why?

613
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:34,976
Aren't you a boy?

614
00:48:36,179 --> 00:48:37,373
She thrashed you.

615
00:48:46,657 --> 00:48:49,387
I had seen a lot of wrestling
competitions in my life.

616
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,058
But today I was going to
witness a bout,

617
00:48:52,462 --> 00:48:55,090
the likes of which, had never
been seen before in Haryana.

618
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:58,264
A riot was inevitable.

619
00:49:02,139 --> 00:49:05,165
M r. Mahavir Singh Phogat...
welcome!

620
00:49:05,342 --> 00:49:07,674
It's an honor that you have come
to watch the competition.

621
00:49:08,111 --> 00:49:09,601
I've got a wrestler with me too.

622
00:49:09,713 --> 00:49:10,611
Name, please.

623
00:49:11,048 --> 00:49:12,572
Geeta Kumari Phogat.

624
00:49:14,518 --> 00:49:15,485
What?

625
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:18,285
Geeta Kumari Phogat.

626
00:49:22,326 --> 00:49:23,953
You'll make a girl wrestle?

627
00:49:24,094 --> 00:49:25,026
Yes. So?

628
00:49:31,435 --> 00:49:32,197
Write.

629
00:49:34,438 --> 00:49:38,397
Sir, the day I organize
a cooking competition,

630
00:49:38,675 --> 00:49:40,302
that day get Ms. Geeta along.

631
00:49:41,178 --> 00:49:42,577
This is a wrestling competition!

632
00:49:44,681 --> 00:49:46,740
We have come from very far.

633
00:49:47,351 --> 00:49:49,649
We won't return without a fight.

634
00:49:50,354 --> 00:49:52,379
Either Geeta will fight,

635
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:53,987
or you and l.

636
00:49:54,224 --> 00:49:57,091
First, you utter nonsense,
and then you are being stubborn too!

637
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:58,252
What do you mean?

638
00:49:58,328 --> 00:50:00,091
You want a girl
to wrestle with boys?

639
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:03,496
You may not be bothered
about your honor, but we are.

640
00:50:03,567 --> 00:50:05,262
I will have your honor
laid out now!

641
00:50:06,303 --> 00:50:07,770
Please... sir.

642
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:11,705
Please... we really respect you, sir.

643
00:50:12,242 --> 00:50:15,075
But what you ask for,
can't happen.

644
00:50:18,015 --> 00:50:19,346
We can't do this, brother.

645
00:50:32,129 --> 00:50:32,686
Let's go.

646
00:50:34,264 --> 00:50:35,561
How dare he...

647
00:50:38,201 --> 00:50:40,260
You are getting a chance to
play the game,

648
00:50:40,337 --> 00:50:42,362
and you are giving a walkover?

649
00:50:43,673 --> 00:50:44,469
Meaning?

650
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:47,135
How many years have we been
holding wrestling competitions?

651
00:50:47,477 --> 00:50:48,068
Five.

652
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:50,441
How many people come to see?

653
00:50:50,614 --> 00:50:52,104
Just a handful.

654
00:50:52,482 --> 00:50:53,107
So?

655
00:50:53,316 --> 00:50:55,113
Dimwit, think about it.

656
00:50:55,285 --> 00:50:58,083
In a town that has never
seen a girl wrestle,

657
00:50:58,288 --> 00:51:01,189
when a girl wrestles a boy,

658
00:51:01,324 --> 00:51:03,383
how many people
will come to watch?

659
00:51:04,361 --> 00:51:06,556
Our competition will go
through the roof!

660
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:08,531
But what if the girl
breaks her arms or legs?

661
00:51:08,598 --> 00:51:10,361
Let them break.

662
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:12,626
You bandage
your broken competition.

663
00:51:13,136 --> 00:51:15,001
Even if you charge
two rupees per ticket,

664
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:17,700
your wrestlers will eat
for months.

665
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:22,602
Mahavir-ji!

666
00:51:24,281 --> 00:51:27,409
Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls!

667
00:51:27,784 --> 00:51:33,689
You must have seen a girl
walk on fire, eat a snake.

668
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:36,783
But today, for the first time
in the history of Rohtak,

669
00:51:37,127 --> 00:51:39,721
see a girl wrestling a boy
in a competition,

670
00:51:39,796 --> 00:51:42,526
in half-an-hour, at Lal Chowk.

671
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:44,032
Tickets - two rupees.

672
00:51:44,167 --> 00:51:46,101
A wrestling girl for two rupees!

673
00:51:47,571 --> 00:51:48,799
You have to win!

674
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:55,169
Even if you were to pit
your boys against a lion,

675
00:51:55,312 --> 00:51:57,109
there still wouldn't have been
such a crowd.

676
00:52:04,988 --> 00:52:06,285
What do you think?

677
00:52:06,423 --> 00:52:08,220
How many seconds
will she last?

678
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:09,758
S... s... s...

679
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:12,494
Mate, by the time you finish
she'll be done and dusted.

680
00:52:15,165 --> 00:52:17,156
Will she fight in trunks like these?

681
00:52:18,602 --> 00:52:19,227
Get lost!

682
00:52:19,302 --> 00:52:21,770
I was just hoping.

683
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:24,472
Where is she?

684
00:52:26,343 --> 00:52:28,072
She looks hot.

685
00:52:28,178 --> 00:52:30,146
Hope her t-shirt doesn't tear.

686
00:52:30,247 --> 00:52:32,408
I hope it does!

687
00:52:41,758 --> 00:52:43,191
Go, Geeta!

688
00:52:47,097 --> 00:52:49,156
- Her father has lost it!

689
00:52:51,067 --> 00:52:53,092
Do you know
the rules of mud-wrestling?

690
00:52:54,204 --> 00:52:56,536
Then choose who you
want to lose to.

691
00:53:02,145 --> 00:53:03,703
Who do you think she'll pick?

692
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:06,141
Our Scrawny Spider.

693
00:53:07,384 --> 00:53:09,978
He will win for the first time.

694
00:53:22,132 --> 00:53:25,568
Gosh, Jassi will beat her to pulp!

695
00:53:25,635 --> 00:53:28,069
Three of you, out of here.

696
00:53:29,506 --> 00:53:31,997
Your girl has lost it.

697
00:53:32,442 --> 00:53:34,569
There is still time, stop her.

698
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:37,737
Or she'll go back on a stretcher.

699
00:53:38,748 --> 00:53:42,184
Before you fight a bout
you have to fight fear.

700
00:53:43,653 --> 00:53:45,644
At least, my girl has conquered fear.

701
00:53:46,122 --> 00:53:48,647
Go easy, she's a girl.

702
00:53:49,192 --> 00:53:51,251
Don't make that mistake.

703
00:54:26,229 --> 00:54:28,459
Will you embarrass us?

704
00:54:30,233 --> 00:54:31,666
Geeta, great going!

705
00:55:04,534 --> 00:55:06,001
W... wow!

706
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:21,477
She's gone.

707
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:25,449
Wh... wh... what a save!

708
00:56:00,623 --> 00:56:01,988
You fought well.

709
00:56:02,258 --> 00:56:03,156
Excellent!

710
00:56:04,094 --> 00:56:07,461
The committee awards
the winning wrestler, Jassi,

711
00:56:07,964 --> 00:56:10,330
with a cash prize of 20 rupees.

712
00:56:11,501 --> 00:56:14,368
And from our patron, Kartar Singh,

713
00:56:14,604 --> 00:56:18,233
a special prize for
Geeta Kumari of 50 rupees!

714
00:56:28,017 --> 00:56:29,109
Sorry, papa.

715
00:56:32,188 --> 00:56:33,177
It's okay.

716
00:56:33,556 --> 00:56:34,580
Come on.

717
00:56:41,564 --> 00:56:45,022
You got lucky, or you'd have
gone home on a stretcher.

718
00:56:56,513 --> 00:56:57,480
Papa,

719
00:57:01,718 --> 00:57:03,379
when is the next fight?

720
00:57:34,083 --> 00:57:38,179
# Dressed in shorts and a T-shirt
arrives a cyclone. #

721
00:57:38,488 --> 00:57:42,618
# Dressed in shorts and a T-shirt
arrives a cyclone. #

722
00:57:42,692 --> 00:57:45,092
# Make the calls, tell everyone, #

723
00:57:45,161 --> 00:57:47,527
# watch out for the wild cat. #

724
00:57:47,597 --> 00:57:49,997
# Whether you are from
Chandigarh or Delhi, #

725
00:57:50,066 --> 00:57:52,159
# she will flatten you out. #

726
00:57:52,268 --> 00:57:55,260
# She will relocate your limbs. #

727
00:57:55,338 --> 00:57:58,535
# Your attack will be met
with a counter-attack. #

728
00:57:58,608 --> 00:58:00,974
# She will flatten you,
flatten you out. #

729
00:58:01,044 --> 00:58:03,205
# She's a force to reckon with. #

730
00:58:03,279 --> 00:58:05,338
# A force! #

731
00:58:05,448 --> 00:58:07,575
# She's a force to reckon with. #

732
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:10,016
# A force! #

733
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:14,119
From tomorrow you'll have to
bless her as well.

734
00:58:19,395 --> 00:58:21,158
# What a girl! #

735
00:58:23,967 --> 00:58:26,026
# What a girl! #

736
00:58:27,704 --> 00:58:31,037
# Hark, O Wrestler!
Your ego will go up in flames, #

737
00:58:31,107 --> 00:58:33,041
# her grip has such fire. #

738
00:58:33,109 --> 00:58:35,202
# She will measure your self-worth, #

739
00:58:35,278 --> 00:58:37,405
# in tiny millimeters. #

740
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:39,345
# Your breath will run out, #

741
00:58:39,716 --> 00:58:41,547
# she will slam you so hard. #

742
00:58:42,085 --> 00:58:43,677
# She will flatten you out. #

743
00:58:44,387 --> 00:58:46,184
# She will relocate your limbs. #

744
00:58:47,490 --> 00:58:50,687
# Your attack will be met
with a counter-attack. #

745
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:53,194
# She will flatten you,
flatten you out. #

746
00:58:53,263 --> 00:58:55,254
# She's a force to reckon with. #

747
00:58:55,398 --> 00:58:57,298
# A force! #

748
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:59,659
# She's a force to reckon with. #

749
00:58:59,736 --> 00:59:01,567
# A force! #

750
00:59:11,281 --> 00:59:15,945
Once again people had started
talking about Geeta and Babita.

751
00:59:16,085 --> 00:59:20,215
These two girls come from Balali
and thrash boys.

752
00:59:20,423 --> 00:59:22,653
This fellow lost to a girl.

753
00:59:22,725 --> 00:59:24,317
Why don't you fight her?

754
00:59:24,594 --> 00:59:28,121
But this time the heckles were
replaced with applause!

755
00:59:29,265 --> 00:59:32,132
Some did not want to
wrestle with the girls.

756
00:59:34,537 --> 00:59:37,267
And some didn't allow
them to wrestle.

757
00:59:37,507 --> 00:59:38,667
Please leave!

758
00:59:41,110 --> 00:59:43,169
Geeta and Babita were winning
not just wrestling competitions,

759
00:59:43,313 --> 00:59:45,076
but hearts, too.

760
00:59:59,696 --> 01:00:04,861
1 4, 900... 1 5, 000... 1 5, 1 50.

761
01:00:06,669 --> 01:00:09,365
You've become a senior wrestler!

762
01:00:11,107 --> 01:00:14,133
By getting selected to the
Haryana state team,

763
01:00:14,210 --> 01:00:16,041
Geeta Kumari has brought fame
not only to our school,

764
01:00:16,112 --> 01:00:17,272
but to the entire district of Bhiwani.

765
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:19,244
And we are sure that,

766
01:00:19,315 --> 01:00:23,046
she will make our town proud
in the National Sub-Juniors, too.

767
01:00:28,391 --> 01:00:31,189
Leave? For two months?

768
01:00:31,594 --> 01:00:33,528
Is your daughter getting married?

769
01:00:34,364 --> 01:00:37,356
I have to prepare
Geeta for the Nationals, sir.

770
01:00:39,502 --> 01:00:42,437
Forget about it.

771
01:00:43,272 --> 01:00:46,639
If she was getting married,
I might have considered.

772
01:00:49,612 --> 01:00:52,445
I don't understand your decisions.

773
01:00:52,649 --> 01:00:55,049
I didn't have a choice.

774
01:00:56,052 --> 01:00:57,679
I couldn't let go of my dream,

775
01:00:57,820 --> 01:00:59,481
so, I let go of the job.

776
01:01:00,356 --> 01:01:02,051
What will you do now?

777
01:01:03,393 --> 01:01:06,226
I'll start farming
on our own plot of land.

778
01:01:07,063 --> 01:01:08,530
It's hard work,

779
01:01:08,665 --> 01:01:11,327
but at least I will be able
to give the girls time.

780
01:01:19,075 --> 01:01:22,101
Titu... put this in the car.

781
01:01:23,346 --> 01:01:25,143
Wait... go...

782
01:01:27,550 --> 01:01:29,347
Yes, Mahavir Singh-ji,
what were you saying?

783
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:34,521
If I could get some funds,
it would help a lot.

784
01:01:34,791 --> 01:01:37,555
My girl has now reached
the state level.

785
01:01:38,094 --> 01:01:38,526
So...

786
01:01:38,594 --> 01:01:40,585
What is the big deal
in reaching state level?

787
01:01:41,097 --> 01:01:42,724
That too in ladies wrestling?

788
01:01:43,266 --> 01:01:46,531
Your daughter ran alone,
and came first.

789
01:01:49,305 --> 01:01:51,398
What do you need the funds for?

790
01:01:54,177 --> 01:01:57,146
Sir, I want to buy a mat
for her to train on.

791
01:01:58,481 --> 01:02:00,176
She's playing well.

792
01:02:00,483 --> 01:02:01,609
If you support her today,

793
01:02:01,684 --> 01:02:03,515
then one day, she will
make the nation proud.

794
01:02:03,686 --> 01:02:05,517
Look, Mahavir Singh-ji,

795
01:02:05,621 --> 01:02:08,055
we get this much
funding for sports.

796
01:02:08,691 --> 01:02:10,454
Wrestling gets this much.

797
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:12,227
Keep aside gents wrestling,

798
01:02:12,295 --> 01:02:15,731
then remove coaching, dieting,
traveling, equipment, etc.

799
01:02:15,998 --> 01:02:17,989
All that remains for ladies wrestling
is this much.

800
01:02:19,268 --> 01:02:21,600
And for this much,
you bought me a box of sweets.

801
01:02:23,773 --> 01:02:25,707
But you have our
complete support.

802
01:02:31,781 --> 01:02:34,614
The reason lndia
doesn't win medals,

803
01:02:35,151 --> 01:02:38,120
is because officers like you
are warming these seats.

804
01:02:38,454 --> 01:02:40,217
Alright. I'll get up.

805
01:02:40,757 --> 01:02:43,385
Titu, serve me lunch.

806
01:02:45,428 --> 01:02:48,295
Mahavir Singh-ji,
care to join me for lunch?

807
01:02:54,337 --> 01:02:57,534
The Federation is a breeding ground
for such termites.

808
01:02:59,041 --> 01:03:01,532
They have ruined sports.

809
01:03:06,983 --> 01:03:10,248
There is no support
for sports persons,

810
01:03:11,154 --> 01:03:14,715
only abuses when you don't win.

811
01:03:15,525 --> 01:03:18,619
Medalists don't grow on trees.

812
01:03:19,195 --> 01:03:21,322
You have to nurture them.

813
01:03:22,165 --> 01:03:25,623
With love, with hard work,
with passion.

814
01:03:29,138 --> 01:03:33,234
And here, the scoundrels don't
give money for even a mat.

815
01:03:34,310 --> 01:03:36,278
What is a mat, brother?

816
01:03:36,512 --> 01:03:40,175
Synthetic mattresses
on which wrestlers fight.

817
01:03:41,717 --> 01:03:44,743
A mattress is a mattress!

818
01:03:47,356 --> 01:03:48,482
No?

819
01:03:49,625 --> 01:03:51,149
Did I say something wrong?

820
01:04:01,103 --> 01:04:04,072
Uncle had already ruined
our sleep, figuratively speaking.

821
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:07,707
Now he was hell bent
on doing it literally, too.

822
01:04:22,258 --> 01:04:25,557
Wrestling on a mat is different
from mud-wrestling.

823
01:04:26,128 --> 01:04:28,255
Now we have to wrestle
on the mat.

824
01:04:28,364 --> 01:04:31,333
And in mat-wrestling
you have to score points.

825
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:36,360
You can score one, two,
three or five points.

826
01:04:37,406 --> 01:04:38,464
Omkar...

827
01:04:42,612 --> 01:04:45,103
If you hold the opponent
by the waist,

828
01:04:45,181 --> 01:04:47,149
and drop him to his knees,

829
01:04:47,350 --> 01:04:49,341
then you score one point.

830
01:04:49,552 --> 01:04:54,046
And from the ground position
if you roll him on to his back,

831
01:04:54,123 --> 01:04:55,454
then you score two points.

832
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:57,488
There are different ways
to do this.

833
01:04:57,660 --> 01:04:58,558
Uncle!

834
01:04:58,628 --> 01:05:01,096
Like this.

835
01:05:01,497 --> 01:05:04,955
Or from the ground position,
like this!

836
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:13,975
If you flip your opponent on his back
from a standing position,

837
01:05:14,043 --> 01:05:16,204
then you will score three points.

838
01:05:17,446 --> 01:05:18,743
Please, uncle!

839
01:05:19,081 --> 01:05:20,571
Like this... three points.

840
01:05:20,983 --> 01:05:24,316
Like this... from standing position...
on to his back.

841
01:05:24,387 --> 01:05:28,448
To score five points is difficult,
but it can be done.

842
01:05:29,191 --> 01:05:31,386
If you flip your opponent
from a standing position,

843
01:05:31,761 --> 01:05:34,525
above your head
in a rainbow-like arc,

844
01:05:34,764 --> 01:05:36,254
and have him fall on his back,

845
01:05:36,465 --> 01:05:38,262
then you score five points!

846
01:05:38,534 --> 01:05:39,193
Watch.

847
01:05:39,268 --> 01:05:40,064
No... no, please, uncle!

848
01:05:40,136 --> 01:05:41,194
Come here.
- No, please.

849
01:05:46,442 --> 01:05:48,433
A real wrestling mat is not like this.

850
01:05:50,279 --> 01:05:51,712
It's like this.

851
01:06:09,165 --> 01:06:11,599
We have to fight
in the yellow area.

852
01:06:20,276 --> 01:06:22,608
The red zone is a danger area.

853
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:27,211
If you step out of it,
you lose a point.

854
01:06:34,490 --> 01:06:37,653
There are three rounds
of two minutes each.

855
01:06:38,461 --> 01:06:41,225
Three rounds
of two minutes each.

856
01:06:42,631 --> 01:06:46,567
Whoever wins two out of
three rounds, wins the match.

857
01:06:52,008 --> 01:06:54,408
Sir, your daughter is underweight.

858
01:06:55,478 --> 01:06:56,172
So?

859
01:06:56,579 --> 01:06:57,705
Take my advice.
Go back.

860
01:06:58,280 --> 01:07:00,441
Feed her,

861
01:07:00,516 --> 01:07:02,984
fatten her and
come back next year.

862
01:07:03,319 --> 01:07:06,311
If she fights like this,
she will break her bones.

863
01:07:07,156 --> 01:07:10,023
You just tell me whether
she is allowed to wrestle or not.

864
01:07:11,060 --> 01:07:13,392
Yes... she is.

865
01:07:13,562 --> 01:07:15,223
Sign up.

866
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:21,636
"Sub-Junior Nationals"

867
01:07:24,607 --> 01:07:25,403
Good move!

868
01:07:39,221 --> 01:07:42,190
Geeta had defeated beefy boys,

869
01:07:42,425 --> 01:07:45,189
how long could these girls survive?

870
01:07:48,264 --> 01:07:49,561
Is that a girl or a storm?

871
01:07:56,405 --> 01:08:00,933
"Sub-Junior National Champion"

872
01:08:01,377 --> 01:08:03,311
"Junior Nationals"

873
01:08:03,446 --> 01:08:04,435
Is she underweight?

874
01:08:04,613 --> 01:08:07,411
Yes... but how does it matter?

875
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:37,577
"Junior National Champion"

876
01:08:52,027 --> 01:08:55,326
Time flew by.

877
01:08:57,466 --> 01:08:59,730
Geeta went from junior to senior.

878
01:09:01,637 --> 01:09:02,535
And uncle,

879
01:09:02,972 --> 01:09:05,463
from senior to senior-citizen.

880
01:09:09,378 --> 01:09:10,936
Go... Geeta!

881
01:09:12,681 --> 01:09:16,481
Babita and I, went from
shorts to full length pants!

882
01:09:40,543 --> 01:09:42,238
Push... push her down!

883
01:09:45,414 --> 01:09:47,075
Side throw!

884
01:10:00,996 --> 01:10:03,396
Victory to Haryana!

885
01:10:25,521 --> 01:10:27,284
"National Champion"

886
01:10:46,275 --> 01:10:48,573
Finally uncle's dream
has been achieved.

887
01:10:49,044 --> 01:10:51,569
Now we can all relax.

888
01:10:51,780 --> 01:10:52,508
No.

889
01:10:54,783 --> 01:10:56,375
My dream remains to be fulfilled.

890
01:10:58,220 --> 01:11:01,519
Every year sees
a National champion.

891
01:11:02,191 --> 01:11:04,591
My dream will be fulfilled,

892
01:11:05,060 --> 01:11:06,652
when you win gold,
not for yourself,

893
01:11:07,296 --> 01:11:09,196
but for your country.

894
01:11:13,335 --> 01:11:15,303
You can celebrate today.

895
01:11:15,571 --> 01:11:18,506
From tomorrow we start
preparing further.

896
01:11:24,380 --> 01:11:25,540
Papa...

897
01:11:29,051 --> 01:11:31,019
Need to speak to you.

898
01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:32,652
Tell me.

899
01:11:33,322 --> 01:11:34,414
Papa,

900
01:11:35,257 --> 01:11:39,057
now that I am a
National champion, so...

901
01:11:40,696 --> 01:11:41,560
So?

902
01:11:41,664 --> 01:11:43,097
No, I mean,

903
01:11:43,165 --> 01:11:47,431
all National champions
need to go to Patiala,

904
01:11:47,469 --> 01:11:49,164
for further training.

905
01:11:49,705 --> 01:11:51,229
To the National Sports Academy.

906
01:11:51,307 --> 01:11:52,706
What are you getting at?

907
01:11:52,775 --> 01:11:54,174
Tell me clearly.

908
01:11:55,344 --> 01:11:57,335
I will have to go too, papa.

909
01:11:58,647 --> 01:12:01,980
From now, I'll have to train there,

910
01:12:04,186 --> 01:12:06,450
under the national coach.

911
01:12:21,003 --> 01:12:22,470
Geeta Kumari Phogat.

912
01:12:22,638 --> 01:12:24,037
Wrestling.

913
01:12:42,758 --> 01:12:44,282
The place looks good.

914
01:12:46,595 --> 01:12:48,426
Let's hope the coach is good too.

915
01:12:53,369 --> 01:12:54,802
Girls, come on.

916
01:13:00,142 --> 01:13:02,337
You all must be rejoicing,

917
01:13:02,678 --> 01:13:05,306
at the thought of
advanced training.

918
01:13:08,250 --> 01:13:09,410
Well, forget about learning,

919
01:13:10,252 --> 01:13:12,186
first you have to learn to forget!

920
01:13:12,588 --> 01:13:14,715
Forget the wrong training
you've received.

921
01:13:15,190 --> 01:13:17,215
Wrong diet, wrong exercise,
wrong technique.

922
01:13:17,459 --> 01:13:20,053
And after forgetting all that,

923
01:13:20,295 --> 01:13:21,660
your real training will begin,

924
01:13:22,264 --> 01:13:24,459
with National Coach,
Pramod Kadam.

925
01:13:25,701 --> 01:13:29,330
And you will only learn
what I teach you.

926
01:13:31,140 --> 01:13:32,630
Is that clear?
- Yes, sir!

927
01:13:33,075 --> 01:13:35,305
Is that clear?
- Yes, sir!

928
01:13:35,677 --> 01:13:36,439
Good.

929
01:13:37,513 --> 01:13:38,480
Warm up.

930
01:13:39,148 --> 01:13:40,410
Get me tea!

931
01:13:43,152 --> 01:13:44,244
Come on, girls.

932
01:13:44,319 --> 01:13:47,152
Energy... more energy!

933
01:13:47,356 --> 01:13:49,085
Yes, that's the way.

934
01:13:49,158 --> 01:13:50,022
Keep it up!

935
01:13:51,026 --> 01:13:51,492
Good.

936
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:53,027
Namaste, sir.

937
01:13:53,729 --> 01:13:56,061
Sir, I'm Mahavir Singh Phogat.

938
01:13:56,198 --> 01:13:57,665
Geeta's father.

939
01:13:58,801 --> 01:13:59,529
Okay.

940
01:13:59,768 --> 01:14:01,633
I'm the one who has trained her.

941
01:14:01,970 --> 01:14:04,097
Yes... good.

942
01:14:06,008 --> 01:14:06,975
She's good.

943
01:14:07,042 --> 01:14:09,704
Very strong, with a lot of stamina.

944
01:14:13,081 --> 01:14:15,174
Where's my tea?

945
01:14:16,752 --> 01:14:18,219
Come on... move it!

946
01:14:26,028 --> 01:14:27,256
Sir... one request.

947
01:14:29,031 --> 01:14:31,261
If Geeta gets the right coaching,

948
01:14:31,433 --> 01:14:33,731
she will definitely win
an international medal.

949
01:14:36,171 --> 01:14:37,297
Geeta!

950
01:14:39,675 --> 01:14:43,736
There should be a 90 degree
angle between your calf and thigh.

951
01:14:44,246 --> 01:14:46,305
Who has taught you?

952
01:14:48,116 --> 01:14:50,311
Is this how you will win
an international medal?

953
01:14:55,290 --> 01:14:57,485
You came to drop her, right?

954
01:14:58,060 --> 01:14:59,391
You've done that.

955
01:15:01,029 --> 01:15:02,257
Now leave the rest to me.

956
01:15:04,199 --> 01:15:05,666
Don't waste my time!

957
01:15:44,506 --> 01:15:45,666
Is Geeta happy?

958
01:15:48,577 --> 01:15:51,137
The institute must be
very big, isn't it?

959
01:15:54,049 --> 01:15:56,745
Everyone there must be
a champion, isn't it?

960
01:15:58,687 --> 01:16:00,382
And the facilities there
must be amazing, right?

961
01:16:00,489 --> 01:16:01,581
Have you trained today?

962
01:16:01,723 --> 01:16:04,021
Yes. And the coach
must be top notch?

963
01:16:04,192 --> 01:16:05,989
You seem very eager
to go there.

964
01:16:08,397 --> 01:16:10,262
Remember, I'm still your coach.

965
01:16:12,634 --> 01:16:14,499
Your first time
away from home?

966
01:16:16,238 --> 01:16:19,503
Just you wait...
we'll have a blast.

967
01:16:21,410 --> 01:16:23,708
Girls, 'DDLJ' is showing on TV.

968
01:16:24,146 --> 01:16:24,737
Wow!

969
01:16:25,380 --> 01:16:26,677
Let's watch.

970
01:16:27,015 --> 01:16:28,175
I'm going to sleep.

971
01:16:28,250 --> 01:16:30,616
You can't say no
to Shah Rukh Khan.

972
01:16:31,053 --> 01:16:32,315
It's a sin.

973
01:16:32,454 --> 01:16:33,182
Come.

974
01:16:36,992 --> 01:16:41,656
"Raj, if this girl loves you,
she will turn to look at you."

975
01:16:42,664 --> 01:16:43,528
Please turn.

976
01:16:45,534 --> 01:16:46,523
"Turn."

977
01:16:47,035 --> 01:16:48,024
Turn.

978
01:16:51,373 --> 01:16:52,431
Turn.

979
01:16:53,342 --> 01:16:54,309
"Turn."

980
01:16:55,243 --> 01:16:57,643
She turned!

981
01:17:09,358 --> 01:17:13,021
Just grow your hair.
You will kill it.

982
01:17:13,595 --> 01:17:15,290
A rhino uses strength,

983
01:17:15,397 --> 01:17:18,560
but the tiger uses both
strength and technique.

984
01:17:19,034 --> 01:17:21,093
Be a tiger, not a rhino.

985
01:17:21,203 --> 01:17:22,033
Clear?

986
01:17:31,613 --> 01:17:33,342
# These new colours,
these sweet sounds, #

987
01:17:33,415 --> 01:17:36,475
# why do my days
suddenly seem different? #

988
01:17:37,753 --> 01:17:40,085
# I know not. #

989
01:17:40,155 --> 01:17:42,555
# Why is my heart leaping, #

990
01:17:42,624 --> 01:17:45,252
# like a squirrel? #

991
01:17:46,161 --> 01:17:48,152
# I know not. #

992
01:17:48,230 --> 01:17:49,754
# These new colours,
these sweet sounds, #

993
01:17:50,032 --> 01:17:53,160
# why do my days
suddenly seem different? #

994
01:17:54,436 --> 01:17:56,495
# I know not. #

995
01:17:56,571 --> 01:17:59,096
# Why is my heart leaping, #

996
01:17:59,174 --> 01:18:01,233
# like a squirrel? #

997
01:18:01,309 --> 01:18:02,674
Shall we go out later tonight?

998
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:06,671
# Is the weather a little wild, #

999
01:18:06,948 --> 01:18:09,416
# or is my spirit soaring? #

1000
01:18:09,484 --> 01:18:11,645
Just one won't make a difference.

1001
01:18:12,421 --> 01:18:15,117
# The taste of free will, #

1002
01:18:15,190 --> 01:18:18,717
# is so juicy. #

1003
01:18:19,261 --> 01:18:20,956
# I know not, #

1004
01:18:21,029 --> 01:18:23,190
# why the branches
of my desire, #

1005
01:18:23,265 --> 01:18:26,359
# are suddenly blooming
with flaming flowers? #

1006
01:18:27,502 --> 01:18:29,493
# I know not, #

1007
01:18:29,571 --> 01:18:32,131
# why is my heart leaping, #

1008
01:18:32,207 --> 01:18:35,108
# like a squirrel? #

1009
01:18:35,744 --> 01:18:38,372
# I know not. #

1010
01:18:41,983 --> 01:18:44,110
Y es, that's the way!

1011
01:18:44,186 --> 01:18:46,416
Remember one mistake
can cost you the medal.

1012
01:18:54,196 --> 01:18:57,723
# A new friendship is forming, #

1013
01:18:58,200 --> 01:19:01,192
# with the limitless open skies. #

1014
01:19:01,503 --> 01:19:03,937
# That's making the earth jealous, #

1015
01:19:04,005 --> 01:19:09,671
# she's complaining
I'm getting spoilt. #

1016
01:19:10,545 --> 01:19:14,379
# Life too, now-a-days, #

1017
01:19:14,583 --> 01:19:18,144
# seems bored of counting, #

1018
01:19:18,220 --> 01:19:20,347
# it's reciting couplets, #

1019
01:19:20,422 --> 01:19:23,585
# among math equations. #

1020
01:19:23,658 --> 01:19:26,058
Y es papa, training is going well.

1021
01:19:26,294 --> 01:19:27,522
I'm going.
Coach-sir is waiting.

1022
01:19:27,596 --> 01:19:28,585
Bye!

1023
01:19:28,663 --> 01:19:33,600
# I've left behind the arguments
of right and wrong, #

1024
01:19:33,668 --> 01:19:36,034
# I've moved on. #

1025
01:19:36,104 --> 01:19:38,504
# Why is my heart leaping, #

1026
01:19:38,573 --> 01:19:41,133
# like a squirrel? #

1027
01:19:42,144 --> 01:19:43,270
Geeta!

1028
01:19:44,212 --> 01:19:45,144
Come here.

1029
01:19:47,415 --> 01:19:49,576
Forget your papa's technique.

1030
01:19:49,985 --> 01:19:51,976
Learn only what I teach you.

1031
01:19:52,053 --> 01:19:52,712
Got that?

1032
01:19:54,556 --> 01:19:55,318
Hello!

1033
01:19:56,057 --> 01:19:58,218
Sorry, Geeta has gone out.

1034
01:20:02,230 --> 01:20:05,495
For years I have been losing
to both of you intentionally.

1035
01:20:07,302 --> 01:20:08,667
It is the truth!

1036
01:20:10,505 --> 01:20:12,996
That's it!
You see?

1037
01:20:13,441 --> 01:20:16,308
Wrestlers shine only when
the technique is right.

1038
01:20:17,112 --> 01:20:18,602
Win the Nationals soon.

1039
01:20:19,014 --> 01:20:20,208
You too will be sorted.

1040
01:20:20,482 --> 01:20:22,677
Yes... when are you coming home?

1041
01:20:22,751 --> 01:20:24,514
I'm coming next week.

1042
01:20:24,753 --> 01:20:25,685
Need something?

1043
01:20:25,754 --> 01:20:27,312
Nothing. You get here.

1044
01:20:27,722 --> 01:20:28,689
Okay.

1045
01:20:36,665 --> 01:20:38,030
Did you like it?

1046
01:20:38,266 --> 01:20:39,096
Really?

1047
01:20:39,167 --> 01:20:40,498
You grew out your hair.

1048
01:20:40,702 --> 01:20:42,329
It's looking good.

1049
01:20:43,505 --> 01:20:45,473
Your papa won't like it.

1050
01:20:48,510 --> 01:20:51,104
Now everything can't work
the way papa wants.

1051
01:20:51,346 --> 01:20:52,608
Coach-sir didn't say anything.

1052
01:20:53,048 --> 01:20:54,538
And he is such an accomplished coach.

1053
01:20:56,318 --> 01:20:58,513
You do as you please over there.

1054
01:20:59,254 --> 01:21:00,482
Just be a little careful here.

1055
01:21:00,555 --> 01:21:01,214
Mummy,

1056
01:21:01,389 --> 01:21:03,482
real training happens
with a lot of freedom.

1057
01:21:03,658 --> 01:21:05,125
Not with so many restrictions.

1058
01:21:05,327 --> 01:21:08,387
We watch movies,
television, eat out, too.

1059
01:21:08,597 --> 01:21:10,997
My performance hasn't suffered.

1060
01:21:11,132 --> 01:21:13,100
I am the topmost wrestler
at the NSA.

1061
01:21:14,302 --> 01:21:16,099
You home, wrestler?

1062
01:21:24,479 --> 01:21:26,344
How are you?
- I am fine, papa.

1063
01:21:28,083 --> 01:21:29,380
How's your training going?

1064
01:21:29,451 --> 01:21:31,646
She's going to Sydney for a fight.

1065
01:21:34,022 --> 01:21:35,387
How's your training going?

1066
01:21:35,457 --> 01:21:37,186
It's going very well, papa.

1067
01:21:37,259 --> 01:21:38,556
You've seen...

1068
01:21:38,627 --> 01:21:40,618
I'm learning a lot of new things.

1069
01:21:40,695 --> 01:21:43,163
New strategy, moves,
technique...

1070
01:21:43,231 --> 01:21:44,220
very good.

1071
01:21:44,399 --> 01:21:47,493
I have thought that
I will teach her some things, too.

1072
01:21:48,470 --> 01:21:50,529
After all, she too has to
win the Nationals.

1073
01:21:53,141 --> 01:21:54,574
You've grown your hair.

1074
01:21:57,479 --> 01:21:58,741
Papa...
- No.

1075
01:22:00,615 --> 01:22:01,547
It's good.

1076
01:22:07,555 --> 01:22:10,319
Don't just attack,
you've to defend, too.

1077
01:22:10,392 --> 01:22:11,484
Hold me.

1078
01:22:11,726 --> 01:22:13,455
Now, how will you free yourself?

1079
01:22:13,595 --> 01:22:16,496
Hold this way, break and attack.

1080
01:22:16,698 --> 01:22:17,357
Got that?

1081
01:22:17,432 --> 01:22:19,491
That's an old technique.

1082
01:22:20,468 --> 01:22:21,230
Let me...

1083
01:22:23,238 --> 01:22:24,364
Hold me.

1084
01:22:25,407 --> 01:22:26,601
Tight.

1085
01:22:27,542 --> 01:22:30,102
Push your thumbs in this way,

1086
01:22:30,245 --> 01:22:31,212
and move it to the side.

1087
01:22:31,579 --> 01:22:34,070
Not in the front... but to the side.
Break and attack.

1088
01:22:34,149 --> 01:22:36,140
What's wrong with my technique?

1089
01:22:37,152 --> 01:22:38,176
What's wrong?

1090
01:22:38,253 --> 01:22:39,777
No, papa. It's not wrong.

1091
01:22:40,121 --> 01:22:43,147
This is more correct.
Coach-sir has taught it.

1092
01:22:43,258 --> 01:22:45,123
So now you are an expert?

1093
01:22:45,293 --> 01:22:46,783
International?

1094
01:22:47,595 --> 01:22:49,119
Papa, I was...

1095
01:22:49,264 --> 01:22:52,756
I'd like to know, what is it that
your coach-sir has taught you,

1096
01:22:53,268 --> 01:22:54,667
that your father couldn't.

1097
01:22:58,139 --> 01:23:00,198
Not her, show me.

1098
01:23:01,242 --> 01:23:02,368
Come on.

1099
01:23:05,246 --> 01:23:07,077
Push your thumbs in this way...

1100
01:23:11,987 --> 01:23:14,148
So, this is what your coach-sir
has taught you!

1101
01:23:14,389 --> 01:23:17,051
Is this how you'll win
an international medal?

1102
01:23:24,666 --> 01:23:25,724
I wasn't ready, papa.

1103
01:23:26,768 --> 01:23:28,133
So, get ready.

1104
01:26:09,631 --> 01:26:11,724
This is what I was saying, papa.

1105
01:26:14,536 --> 01:26:16,128
Isn't there a difference?

1106
01:27:01,683 --> 01:27:03,583
What happened today
wasn't right.

1107
01:27:04,352 --> 01:27:06,081
What wasn't right?

1108
01:27:06,955 --> 01:27:08,388
This was bound to happen.

1109
01:27:08,489 --> 01:27:11,322
Someone had to tell papa
that his techniques are weak.

1110
01:27:11,459 --> 01:27:13,689
His techniques aren't weak.

1111
01:27:13,995 --> 01:27:15,963
He's become a little weak.

1112
01:27:16,130 --> 01:27:17,563
And don't forget that
you've won the Nationals,

1113
01:27:17,599 --> 01:27:19,692
based on his "weak" techniques.

1114
01:27:20,134 --> 01:27:23,661
You can win the Nationals
with these techniques, Babita,

1115
01:27:24,439 --> 01:27:25,736
not international matches.

1116
01:27:26,007 --> 01:27:29,272
And the sooner
you realize this, the better.

1117
01:27:34,349 --> 01:27:35,611
Alright.

1118
01:27:36,217 --> 01:27:38,515
You keep faith in your techniques.

1119
01:27:39,053 --> 01:27:41,385
I still put my faith in papa.

1120
01:27:42,257 --> 01:27:46,717
I pray to God that you fight
well at the Nationals.

1121
01:27:48,263 --> 01:27:51,755
And I pray that you do well
in your international tournament.

1122
01:27:56,437 --> 01:28:01,272
# This world is a lie. #

1123
01:28:01,542 --> 01:28:08,072
# True is my pain. #

1124
01:28:08,316 --> 01:28:13,652
# Mirage-like, my beloved, #

1125
01:28:14,422 --> 01:28:19,189
# is our bond. #

1126
01:28:19,394 --> 01:28:22,090
# Those eyes, #

1127
01:28:22,330 --> 01:28:27,632
# that dreamt
beautiful dreams together, #

1128
01:28:28,336 --> 01:28:33,205
# they tear up in separation now. #

1129
01:28:34,442 --> 01:28:37,070
# Those eyes, #

1130
01:28:37,345 --> 01:28:42,681
# that stayed awake
nights together, #

1131
01:28:43,318 --> 01:28:47,652
# refuse to awaken
even in the mornings. #

1132
01:28:47,989 --> 01:28:51,982
# Separated are the paths, #

1133
01:28:52,360 --> 01:28:58,128
# of those who pledged, #

1134
01:28:58,266 --> 01:29:00,962
# to walk together always, #

1135
01:29:01,202 --> 01:29:03,693
# now they share only sorrow. #

1136
01:29:03,971 --> 01:29:06,633
# Those misty eyes, #

1137
01:29:07,342 --> 01:29:12,507
# that peered through
windows with hope, #

1138
01:29:13,381 --> 01:29:18,580
# are now suffocated
with despair. #

1139
01:29:42,977 --> 01:29:45,605
# The breath is unsettled, #

1140
01:29:46,147 --> 01:29:49,082
# with thoughts that torment. #

1141
01:29:49,150 --> 01:29:54,713
# Why is this soul in disarray? #

1142
01:29:55,123 --> 01:29:57,591
# Why this despair? #

1143
01:29:58,126 --> 01:30:00,424
# This disheartenment? #

1144
01:30:01,028 --> 01:30:07,399
# Why is the heart filled with
the storm of a million questions? #

1145
01:30:07,602 --> 01:30:10,070
# Those eyes, #

1146
01:30:10,471 --> 01:30:15,738
# that shone brightly like
stars in the sky, #

1147
01:30:16,444 --> 01:30:22,144
# have now disappeared
in the dark night. #

1148
01:30:22,583 --> 01:30:24,744
# Those eyes, #

1149
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:30,685
# that used to feast
on the warmth of the sun, #

1150
01:30:31,526 --> 01:30:35,519
# tired, now seek the shade. #

1151
01:30:35,797 --> 01:30:40,131
# Separated are the paths, #

1152
01:30:40,368 --> 01:30:46,170
# of those who pledged, #

1153
01:30:46,374 --> 01:30:49,275
# to walk together always, #

1154
01:30:49,410 --> 01:30:51,810
# now they share only sorrow. #

1155
01:30:52,079 --> 01:30:55,173
# Those misty eyes, #

1156
01:30:55,483 --> 01:31:00,785
# that peered through
windows with hope, #

1157
01:31:01,456 --> 01:31:07,156
# are now suffocated
with despair. #

1158
01:31:08,029 --> 01:31:11,590
"World Championship, Sydney"

1159
01:31:15,670 --> 01:31:19,504
"National Games, New Delhi"

1160
01:31:36,224 --> 01:31:37,350
Go... Babita!

1161
01:31:39,760 --> 01:31:41,193
Throw her.

1162
01:31:58,779 --> 01:32:00,406
What are you doing, Geeta?

1163
01:32:09,190 --> 01:32:10,157
What are you doing, Geeta?

1164
01:32:10,224 --> 01:32:11,384
Defend!

1165
01:32:14,095 --> 01:32:15,392
Attack!

1166
01:32:17,732 --> 01:32:18,699
Good one!

1167
01:32:23,571 --> 01:32:24,595
Is this how you defend?

1168
01:32:25,106 --> 01:32:27,540
The next round, too,
play attacking.

1169
01:33:12,687 --> 01:33:14,655
You don't look happy, papa.

1170
01:33:16,657 --> 01:33:18,056
Didn't I fight properly?

1171
01:33:19,627 --> 01:33:21,026
No, my dear.

1172
01:33:21,329 --> 01:33:23,524
You fought exactly as I expected.

1173
01:33:27,101 --> 01:33:32,038
But, I never imagined Geeta
would fight like this.

1174
01:33:36,510 --> 01:33:39,035
And now, you too,
have won the Nationals.

1175
01:33:39,313 --> 01:33:40,678
You too, will go to NSA.

1176
01:33:41,515 --> 01:33:43,210
You'll have a new coach.

1177
01:33:44,652 --> 01:33:48,213
And your papa once again
will become old.

1178
01:33:52,226 --> 01:33:53,090
No, papa.

1179
01:33:59,800 --> 01:34:02,166
Never forget,

1180
01:34:04,472 --> 01:34:07,100
how you got till here.

1181
01:34:24,225 --> 01:34:25,624
Hey, champion.

1182
01:34:27,261 --> 01:34:28,193
Hello, sis.

1183
01:34:31,699 --> 01:34:33,291
Still upset?

1184
01:34:36,437 --> 01:34:37,199
Come.

1185
01:34:38,005 --> 01:34:40,166
What did you fill in the bag?
- Let me get it.

1186
01:34:40,241 --> 01:34:41,265
It's so heavy.

1187
01:34:42,176 --> 01:34:43,302
Hi, Jasmeet!

1188
01:34:44,512 --> 01:34:47,242
This is my younger sister, Babita.

1189
01:34:47,314 --> 01:34:50,215
Whoa! A family of wrestlers!

1190
01:34:51,585 --> 01:34:52,779
Here is the mess.

1191
01:34:53,087 --> 01:34:54,645
This is were we hog.

1192
01:34:59,326 --> 01:35:00,759
This is the lounge.

1193
01:35:01,062 --> 01:35:03,587
Here we chill and watch TV.

1194
01:35:04,532 --> 01:35:06,500
Where is the training center?

1195
01:35:09,036 --> 01:35:11,061
My, aren't you eager!

1196
01:35:11,572 --> 01:35:14,166
See it tomorrow.
Rest today.

1197
01:35:18,979 --> 01:35:20,469
Can I say something?

1198
01:35:20,581 --> 01:35:21,980
Don't feel offended.

1199
01:35:23,217 --> 01:35:24,343
Tell me.

1200
01:35:24,985 --> 01:35:27,044
You've changed a lot.

1201
01:35:29,423 --> 01:35:33,655
I remember the first time
you lost a match.

1202
01:35:34,528 --> 01:35:36,496
You couldn't sleep all night.

1203
01:35:37,064 --> 01:35:41,057
And now, in spite of losing an
international fight you are...

1204
01:35:41,402 --> 01:35:45,702
I mean, it doesn't show
at all on your face.

1205
01:35:47,775 --> 01:35:50,175
Has papa trained you
to say this?

1206
01:35:51,178 --> 01:35:54,045
I remember papa's training
very well.

1207
01:35:54,715 --> 01:35:56,342
It seems you've forgotten.

1208
01:35:56,550 --> 01:35:59,348
You focus on your training.

1209
01:35:59,587 --> 01:36:01,179
I will manage mine.

1210
01:36:02,123 --> 01:36:03,613
And why are you lecturing me?

1211
01:36:03,991 --> 01:36:05,583
I've only lost one match.

1212
01:36:10,531 --> 01:36:11,555
"Moscow"

1213
01:36:11,632 --> 01:36:14,157
Geeta Kumari is trailing
in the second round as well.

1214
01:36:14,235 --> 01:36:17,261
She's fought well,
but hasn't managed much.

1215
01:36:17,338 --> 01:36:18,703
Geeta tries,

1216
01:36:19,573 --> 01:36:21,473
but Kasha scores one point.

1217
01:36:22,243 --> 01:36:24,006
And that's it!

1218
01:36:24,411 --> 01:36:28,006
Geeta Kumari makes an early exit
from the world championship.

1219
01:36:28,716 --> 01:36:31,310
What a disappointment!

1220
01:36:32,019 --> 01:36:36,080
Yet another defeat for
India's Geeta Kumari Phogat.

1221
01:36:38,993 --> 01:36:42,394
In Jakarta too, Geeta exits
in the first round.

1222
01:36:43,664 --> 01:36:50,593
A humiliating defeat for Geeta
in the Istanbul World Championship!

1223
01:37:01,448 --> 01:37:03,075
Geeta, don't lose hope.

1224
01:37:03,217 --> 01:37:05,082
We've worked very hard.
And you played well.

1225
01:37:05,219 --> 01:37:06,379
You just couldn't win.

1226
01:37:06,987 --> 01:37:09,046
It doesn't mean you are
a bad wrestler.

1227
01:37:10,024 --> 01:37:10,683
It happens.

1228
01:37:11,058 --> 01:37:12,719
Some people are not made
for international victory.

1229
01:37:39,720 --> 01:37:41,517
Do you feel too,

1230
01:37:43,524 --> 01:37:45,651
that I'm not cut out
for an international medal?

1231
01:37:49,730 --> 01:37:52,096
I don't know about that.

1232
01:37:53,200 --> 01:37:55,134
All I know,

1233
01:37:56,003 --> 01:37:57,493
is that you are the girl,

1234
01:37:57,738 --> 01:38:00,104
who thrashed boys
in mud-wrestling.

1235
01:38:01,976 --> 01:38:03,204
You are the girl,

1236
01:38:03,410 --> 01:38:06,379
who in spite of being
underweight, won sub-juniors.

1237
01:38:08,449 --> 01:38:11,577
You beat everyone at the Nationals
for three straight years.

1238
01:38:14,622 --> 01:38:17,284
If you are not cut out
for international victory,

1239
01:38:17,524 --> 01:38:21,460
then I don't know
which girl in lndia is.

1240
01:38:28,369 --> 01:38:31,202
I have a lot of faith in you,

1241
01:38:32,406 --> 01:38:36,502
but it's nothing compared to
the faith that papa has in you.

1242
01:38:38,545 --> 01:38:40,445
Talk to him once.

1243
01:38:43,517 --> 01:38:45,417
How do I face him?

1244
01:38:45,719 --> 01:38:47,619
He's our papa.

1245
01:38:49,456 --> 01:38:51,287
At worst, what will happen?

1246
01:38:51,625 --> 01:38:53,149
He will give you an earful.

1247
01:38:53,394 --> 01:38:54,622
Take it.

1248
01:38:55,562 --> 01:38:58,326
His reprimands have
always helped us, haven't they?

1249
01:39:06,373 --> 01:39:07,670
Your medicine.

1250
01:39:12,680 --> 01:39:14,409
I spoke to Babita.

1251
01:39:14,581 --> 01:39:17,243
She said the training
was going well.

1252
01:39:21,722 --> 01:39:22,950
And?

1253
01:39:25,626 --> 01:39:27,389
Geeta is not okay.

1254
01:39:29,063 --> 01:39:30,655
Please talk to her once.

1255
01:39:47,614 --> 01:39:48,672
Hello.

1256
01:39:50,317 --> 01:39:51,284
Geeta?

1257
01:39:53,087 --> 01:39:55,021
Okay, wait.

1258
01:39:56,690 --> 01:39:57,657
Geeta...

1259
01:40:45,172 --> 01:40:46,662
Sorry, papa.

1260
01:41:13,367 --> 01:41:17,531
Only six months remain for
the 19th Commonwealth Games,

1261
01:41:17,571 --> 01:41:20,233
the biggest sporting event in lndia.

1262
01:41:20,641 --> 01:41:26,170
What remains to be seen is how
the lndian players hold up,

1263
01:41:26,380 --> 01:41:29,440
against the world's best.

1264
01:41:48,535 --> 01:41:52,335
This time in the Commonwealth games,
I want three medals.

1265
01:41:52,573 --> 01:41:54,063
Now, whether they come
from you three,

1266
01:41:54,141 --> 01:41:55,369
you three or you three!

1267
01:41:55,542 --> 01:41:56,509
I don't care.

1268
01:41:56,577 --> 01:41:57,737
There are six months left.

1269
01:41:58,112 --> 01:41:59,409
Give your best.

1270
01:41:59,713 --> 01:42:00,680
Got that?

1271
01:42:01,115 --> 01:42:01,979
Get cracking!

1272
01:42:02,316 --> 01:42:03,214
Geeta.

1273
01:42:03,317 --> 01:42:04,181
Come here.

1274
01:42:07,588 --> 01:42:09,180
You will get one medal.

1275
01:42:09,356 --> 01:42:09,720
Yes, sir.

1276
01:42:09,990 --> 01:42:12,220
Not in the category
that you are losing in,

1277
01:42:12,292 --> 01:42:14,988
but in the category
in which you can win.

1278
01:42:15,195 --> 01:42:16,059
Got me?

1279
01:42:17,331 --> 01:42:20,494
It's difficult for you to survive
in the 55-kilo category.

1280
01:42:20,767 --> 01:42:23,292
You too must have
realised that by now.

1281
01:42:23,537 --> 01:42:24,765
In the 51-kilo category,

1282
01:42:25,038 --> 01:42:27,768
you can hold your own,
and maybe win.

1283
01:42:29,176 --> 01:42:31,269
Monitor everyone's diet strictly.

1284
01:42:31,445 --> 01:42:32,707
No mess ups.
- Sir!

1285
01:42:35,048 --> 01:42:37,107
Sir, I want to fight in the
55-kilo category!

1286
01:42:39,119 --> 01:42:41,713
If you fight in the 55-kilo category
you'll get no where!

1287
01:42:45,526 --> 01:42:47,255
She has to lose four kilos.

1288
01:42:47,394 --> 01:42:48,691
Change her diet.

1289
01:42:49,062 --> 01:42:51,121
From tomorrow we'll start your
training for the 51-kilo category.

1290
01:42:52,432 --> 01:42:53,660
Come on, girls.

1291
01:42:57,471 --> 01:42:59,735
Why won't you win
in the 55-kilo category?

1292
01:43:00,073 --> 01:43:02,041
No need for you
to lose weight!

1293
01:43:02,242 --> 01:43:04,733
You will fight in the
55-kilo category, and win!

1294
01:43:05,245 --> 01:43:07,145
I'm coming to Patiala.

1295
01:43:14,421 --> 01:43:16,981
We don't know anyone in Patiala.

1296
01:43:17,257 --> 01:43:19,225
How will you stay for six months?

1297
01:43:19,426 --> 01:43:20,518
On rent.

1298
01:43:20,661 --> 01:43:21,753
And food?

1299
01:43:22,162 --> 01:43:23,151
I'll cook.

1300
01:43:23,230 --> 01:43:24,720
I'll cook, uncle!

1301
01:43:26,166 --> 01:43:28,191
I was thinking that
I too could come along.

1302
01:43:29,169 --> 01:43:30,261
What will you do there?

1303
01:43:30,604 --> 01:43:34,062
Well, in the past they did well
when they trained with me.

1304
01:43:34,208 --> 01:43:36,301
So, if they train with me
in the future too...

1305
01:43:36,510 --> 01:43:38,569
Honestly, I think I am
their good luck charm.

1306
01:43:39,713 --> 01:43:41,305
I mean... that's what I think.

1307
01:43:43,016 --> 01:43:46,474
And, I will buy vegetables for you,
chop them for you,

1308
01:43:46,653 --> 01:43:49,178
run errands for you,
press your feet.

1309
01:43:49,523 --> 01:43:51,047
I'll make sure you are stress-free.

1310
01:43:51,258 --> 01:43:53,089
You see...
it's the Commonwealth Games.

1311
01:43:53,293 --> 01:43:54,658
We can't take any chances.

1312
01:44:00,067 --> 01:44:01,625
Start preparing for gold!

1313
01:44:02,002 --> 01:44:04,562
"Patiala"

1314
01:44:08,108 --> 01:44:09,666
The room is on top.

1315
01:44:10,711 --> 01:44:11,541
Come.

1316
01:44:15,048 --> 01:44:17,107
Is there no other room,
in the same budget?

1317
01:44:17,417 --> 01:44:18,349
It's nice.

1318
01:44:18,418 --> 01:44:19,544
Yes!

1319
01:44:19,620 --> 01:44:20,985
It's nice, indeed.

1320
01:44:21,288 --> 01:44:22,255
I have to admit!

1321
01:44:27,461 --> 01:44:28,359
Yes?

1322
01:44:28,428 --> 01:44:32,592
Geeta and Babita Kumari's
father and close cousin.

1323
01:44:37,537 --> 01:44:39,562
Holy cow!

1324
01:44:47,547 --> 01:44:50,038
Uncle, doesn't this place
seem lovely?

1325
01:45:08,068 --> 01:45:09,160
How are you, champ?

1326
01:45:13,740 --> 01:45:14,502
And you?

1327
01:45:14,675 --> 01:45:16,006
I'm good, papa.

1328
01:45:17,477 --> 01:45:18,375
Why are you here?

1329
01:45:18,545 --> 01:45:20,206
Uncle insisted that I come.

1330
01:45:20,280 --> 01:45:22,544
He said it's the Commonwealth Games.
We can't take a chance.

1331
01:45:22,616 --> 01:45:23,981
Shut up, 'TTSS'!

1332
01:45:26,386 --> 01:45:28,718
Geeta's 51-kilo category
training has started,

1333
01:45:28,989 --> 01:45:30,183
and the diet too.

1334
01:45:32,259 --> 01:45:34,284
You continue their diet and training,

1335
01:45:34,728 --> 01:45:37,219
I'll supplement the rest.

1336
01:45:39,566 --> 01:45:41,500
What time does
your training start?

1337
01:45:42,002 --> 01:45:42,696
7am.

1338
01:45:43,637 --> 01:45:44,695
Okay.

1339
01:45:45,072 --> 01:45:46,471
Be ready at 5am tomorrow.

1340
01:45:59,252 --> 01:46:01,413
# I'm here to stay. #

1341
01:46:01,488 --> 01:46:04,218
# Beat the best. #

1342
01:46:04,291 --> 01:46:07,021
# I'm here to stay. #

1343
01:46:07,094 --> 01:46:09,153
# Beat the best. #

1344
01:46:09,229 --> 01:46:14,462
# Hold on firmly to your dreams. #

1345
01:46:14,534 --> 01:46:19,733
# Don't pay heed to what
naysayers and cynics say. #

1346
01:46:20,073 --> 01:46:25,306
# It's their turn today,
let them have their say. #

1347
01:46:25,379 --> 01:46:31,682
# Your turn will come too;
prove your point then! #

1348
01:46:36,556 --> 01:46:42,358
# One roar of the lion silences
the bleating of a thousand sheep. #

1349
01:46:42,429 --> 01:46:44,329
# So, wrestle, O Wrestler! #

1350
01:46:45,165 --> 01:46:47,030
# Wrestle, O Wrestler! #

1351
01:46:47,634 --> 01:46:50,296
# Your glory may rise and fall, #

1352
01:46:50,370 --> 01:46:53,032
# cause up in the sky
your stars are wrestling too. #

1353
01:46:53,106 --> 01:46:54,733
# So, wrestle, O Wrestler! #

1354
01:46:56,009 --> 01:46:57,601
# Wrestle, O Wrestler! #

1355
01:47:15,429 --> 01:47:16,657
Stop... stop.

1356
01:47:17,464 --> 01:47:19,056
Straight attacks won't do.

1357
01:47:19,366 --> 01:47:21,391
You have to play with
the opponent's mind.

1358
01:47:22,536 --> 01:47:26,597
Fake a move...
but make another.

1359
01:47:42,489 --> 01:47:44,116
Sir, I had put her on a diet,

1360
01:47:44,191 --> 01:47:46,284
but, I don't know why
it hasn't reduced.

1361
01:47:48,361 --> 01:47:50,090
What have you been up to, Geeta?

1362
01:47:52,365 --> 01:47:55,232
Will you say something
or just keep crying?

1363
01:48:04,578 --> 01:48:08,947
Sir, judging by their actions
I feel they don't need NSA.

1364
01:48:10,116 --> 01:48:12,084
The rest is up to you.

1365
01:48:15,722 --> 01:48:17,553
Do you all have anything to say?

1366
01:48:21,328 --> 01:48:23,558
So you admit you are at fault.

1367
01:48:24,231 --> 01:48:26,392
Sir, they have just one fault.

1368
01:48:26,700 --> 01:48:28,361
That their father is crazy.

1369
01:48:30,704 --> 01:48:34,333
He is so crazy about getting
a gold for the country,

1370
01:48:35,308 --> 01:48:38,038
that in their childhood itself
he snatched away their toys,

1371
01:48:38,278 --> 01:48:39,973
and made them wrestle.

1372
01:48:41,281 --> 01:48:43,476
When they resisted,
he cut their hair off.

1373
01:48:44,084 --> 01:48:47,144
In order to prepare them,
he made them wrestle boys.

1374
01:48:47,454 --> 01:48:49,979
Took the taunts and abuses
of the entire village,

1375
01:48:51,057 --> 01:48:53,287
just so that one day they would
make the country proud.

1376
01:49:02,669 --> 01:49:03,966
Look, sir.

1377
01:49:04,271 --> 01:49:04,999
Look.

1378
01:49:05,238 --> 01:49:07,138
These 50 rupees
she won at Rohtak.

1379
01:49:07,407 --> 01:49:08,704
This in Hisar.

1380
01:49:10,243 --> 01:49:11,403
This in Chandigarh.

1381
01:49:12,178 --> 01:49:16,046
This... this, all this... sir.

1382
01:49:16,650 --> 01:49:20,177
These girls have traveled
a long way to reach here, sir.

1383
01:49:20,620 --> 01:49:23,316
Now don't tell them to turn back.

1384
01:49:24,057 --> 01:49:25,285
It's all my fault.

1385
01:49:25,559 --> 01:49:27,254
I humbly apologise.

1386
01:49:35,569 --> 01:49:38,037
Coach-sir is just concerned
with getting three medals.

1387
01:49:38,238 --> 01:49:40,069
No matter if they are bronze.

1388
01:49:40,640 --> 01:49:43,370
But I want our country
to win gold.

1389
01:49:44,210 --> 01:49:46,303
And this girl can do it, sir.

1390
01:49:58,191 --> 01:49:59,715
All of you, please wait outside.

1391
01:50:09,536 --> 01:50:12,061
You've made a mistake
by wasting time.

1392
01:50:13,406 --> 01:50:16,375
In 55-kilos, Geeta won't even
get selected for lndia.

1393
01:50:17,510 --> 01:50:20,104
If she had fought in the 51-kilos
she could've won a medal.

1394
01:50:20,780 --> 01:50:25,410
She should've won a medal
much earlier, in 55-kilos itself.

1395
01:50:26,052 --> 01:50:27,485
You are responsible for that!

1396
01:50:28,021 --> 01:50:28,783
What did I do wrong?

1397
01:50:29,155 --> 01:50:31,453
Geeta's natural game is attacking.

1398
01:50:32,292 --> 01:50:36,353
By putting technique above instinct,
you've changed her game.

1399
01:50:36,796 --> 01:50:40,061
It's like telling a tiger
to fight like an elephant.

1400
01:50:41,468 --> 01:50:44,403
You'll be left with neither
a tiger nor an elephant.

1401
01:50:44,571 --> 01:50:45,731
So, why don't you tell me,

1402
01:50:46,172 --> 01:50:48,402
how to fight to win a medal!

1403
01:50:48,608 --> 01:50:52,738
With your permission, I would like to
demonstrate it here and now.

1404
01:50:53,246 --> 01:50:54,508
They're calling you inside.

1405
01:50:59,052 --> 01:51:00,349
What happened was wrong.

1406
01:51:00,553 --> 01:51:03,147
But the committee has decided
to give them another chance.

1407
01:51:03,289 --> 01:51:04,153
Thank you, sir.

1408
01:51:04,257 --> 01:51:06,521
But, from today,

1409
01:51:07,227 --> 01:51:09,457
neither are you allowed
to enter the NSA premises,

1410
01:51:09,996 --> 01:51:12,988
nor are they allowed
to step out.

1411
01:51:16,736 --> 01:51:17,668
Okay, sir.

1412
01:51:24,210 --> 01:51:26,644
Today, make one for me too, uncle.

1413
01:51:29,649 --> 01:51:30,673
Sorry.

1414
01:51:37,223 --> 01:51:38,247
Thank you.

1415
01:51:43,396 --> 01:51:45,159
We had come to play the lead role,

1416
01:51:45,231 --> 01:51:47,756
NSA made ours
a guest appearance.

1417
01:51:48,401 --> 01:51:50,232
Let's head back now.

1418
01:51:50,770 --> 01:51:52,260
No, Omkar.

1419
01:51:52,739 --> 01:51:55,537
They can stop me
from going inside,

1420
01:51:56,743 --> 01:52:00,201
but no one can stop me
from coaching Geeta.

1421
01:52:01,514 --> 01:52:02,481
Cheers, uncle.

1422
01:52:04,984 --> 01:52:06,713
Against three of them
I held my own.

1423
01:52:07,120 --> 01:52:09,384
But the one who
took me to the cleaners...

1424
01:52:09,456 --> 01:52:13,051
she was smaller than me
and not that strong either.

1425
01:52:13,259 --> 01:52:14,726
Do you have a recording
of this match?

1426
01:52:15,061 --> 01:52:17,154
Yes papa, in the library.

1427
01:52:17,230 --> 01:52:19,289
Courier me a copy of all.

1428
01:52:26,039 --> 01:52:29,202
Only three months remain
for the Delhi Commonwealth Games.

1429
01:52:29,275 --> 01:52:33,371
And the fervor can be sensed at the
National Sports Academy in Patiala.

1430
01:52:36,116 --> 01:52:38,107
Where are we going, uncle?

1431
01:52:39,552 --> 01:52:42,419
The one thing
I disliked about uncle,

1432
01:52:42,722 --> 01:52:45,190
was his constant
air of suspense.

1433
01:52:45,291 --> 01:52:47,521
It could kill you!

1434
01:52:51,131 --> 01:52:53,258
"CrazyCougar.com"

1435
01:52:53,466 --> 01:52:55,366
"The Lustful Aunt"

1436
01:52:57,270 --> 01:53:00,137
If you want to watch a movie,
let's go to Amar Mahal.

1437
01:53:00,273 --> 01:53:01,706
They don't show decent films here.

1438
01:53:02,242 --> 01:53:03,300
Get off.

1439
01:53:06,045 --> 01:53:07,307
"Wild Daughter"

1440
01:53:08,381 --> 01:53:08,745
Yes?

1441
01:53:09,015 --> 01:53:11,506
How much for all the tickets
of the next show?

1442
01:53:12,385 --> 01:53:14,615
Which film do you
want to watch?

1443
01:53:15,155 --> 01:53:16,349
We've brought it with us.

1444
01:53:20,326 --> 01:53:21,520
Pause.

1445
01:53:25,765 --> 01:53:27,164
Play.

1446
01:53:40,446 --> 01:53:41,344
Are you done?

1447
01:53:41,414 --> 01:53:42,506
Be happy.

1448
01:53:42,682 --> 01:53:44,343
Your next show is sold-out too.

1449
01:53:44,517 --> 01:53:47,543
What are you guys up to?

1450
01:53:47,720 --> 01:53:49,779
I mean, where is the movie from?

1451
01:53:50,123 --> 01:53:53,251
Atlanta... Indonesia.

1452
01:53:53,326 --> 01:53:54,418
Imported?
- Yes.

1453
01:53:54,494 --> 01:53:56,587
Listen, can I make a copy?

1454
01:53:56,729 --> 01:53:58,594
Give me 50 rupees less.

1455
01:54:03,303 --> 01:54:06,170
How will she win
if she fights like this?

1456
01:54:06,706 --> 01:54:08,139
Uncle!

1457
01:54:09,209 --> 01:54:13,202
Uncle, you've gathered
the knowledge,

1458
01:54:13,446 --> 01:54:15,141
but how will you pass it on?

1459
01:54:15,215 --> 01:54:18,082
NSA has issued a 'shoot-at-sight'
order against you.

1460
01:54:20,687 --> 01:54:21,654
Sit.

1461
01:54:22,655 --> 01:54:24,213
Again... suspense!

1462
01:54:25,124 --> 01:54:26,614
Is this how you fight?

1463
01:54:26,693 --> 01:54:28,490
Like a quivering kitten?

1464
01:54:29,229 --> 01:54:31,390
If this is how you want to fight,
then don't.

1465
01:54:31,464 --> 01:54:32,522
What happened, papa?

1466
01:54:32,599 --> 01:54:35,033
I saw all your matches.

1467
01:54:35,535 --> 01:54:37,765
You weren't wrestling,
that's for sure!

1468
01:54:39,038 --> 01:54:42,007
Do you have copies of
the DVDs that you gave me?

1469
01:54:42,308 --> 01:54:43,275
Yes, papa.

1470
01:54:43,409 --> 01:54:45,741
Can you arrange to watch
them alone?

1471
01:54:46,179 --> 01:54:47,544
I'll borrow a laptop.

1472
01:54:48,314 --> 01:54:49,212
Alright.

1473
01:54:49,349 --> 01:54:51,112
Be ready at 5am tomorrow.

1474
01:54:56,522 --> 01:54:58,456
It's been a while since
papa gave me an earful.

1475
01:55:00,326 --> 01:55:01,122
Felt good.

1476
01:55:03,229 --> 01:55:05,493
Play the Jakarta fight, round one.

1477
01:55:06,032 --> 01:55:07,021
I have, papa.

1478
01:55:07,200 --> 01:55:09,168
Go to three minutes 58 seconds.

1479
01:55:10,637 --> 01:55:12,605
You have a lead
of two points,

1480
01:55:12,672 --> 01:55:14,435
and you started
playing defensive.

1481
01:55:16,175 --> 01:55:17,540
Play. Look.

1482
01:55:20,246 --> 01:55:21,713
Threw away the lead, didn't you?

1483
01:55:23,650 --> 01:55:26,619
When the opponent is trailing,
go for the jugular!

1484
01:55:34,160 --> 01:55:35,252
How did you do that?

1485
01:55:36,663 --> 01:55:40,292
Alternately, when you should be defending,
you are attacking and giving away points.

1486
01:55:40,600 --> 01:55:43,330
You will gain nothing by
desperately chasing after points.

1487
01:55:43,569 --> 01:55:45,662
You'll have to apply your mind.

1488
01:55:46,105 --> 01:55:48,437
You've lost matches
that were yours to win!

1489
01:55:56,516 --> 01:55:57,505
Go... Geeta!

1490
01:55:57,750 --> 01:56:00,446
"National Trials, Patiala"

1491
01:56:14,968 --> 01:56:17,596
Each round consists of two minutes.

1492
01:56:18,404 --> 01:56:23,239
However, there are 120 seconds
in those two minutes.

1493
01:56:23,576 --> 01:56:28,240
Wait for that one second
when the opponent makes a mistake.

1494
01:56:32,552 --> 01:56:34,577
She's good. Isn't she?

1495
01:56:35,588 --> 01:56:36,612
Yes, sir.

1496
01:56:38,291 --> 01:56:39,315
Very good!

1497
01:56:43,663 --> 01:56:46,097
Now you look ready, sis.

1498
01:56:47,166 --> 01:56:48,428
Did you tell papa?

1499
01:56:49,302 --> 01:56:50,234
What did he say?

1500
01:56:51,270 --> 01:56:53,431
"There's no need to get too happy!"

1501
01:57:00,013 --> 01:57:03,540
A grand opening ceremony
to the 201 0 Commonwealth Games!

1502
01:57:05,985 --> 01:57:09,716
Host nation, India, displaying
her ancient culture.

1503
01:57:10,123 --> 01:57:12,614
A proud moment indeed!

1504
01:57:17,196 --> 01:57:20,222
And here comes
the Indian contingent!

1505
01:57:25,438 --> 01:57:28,737
A huge welcome for them.

1506
01:57:32,045 --> 01:57:35,310
Let us remind you that
the finest athletes,

1507
01:57:35,381 --> 01:57:38,179
from 72 countries are participating.

1508
01:57:38,651 --> 01:57:42,314
We'll be back tomorrow
to start off the events.

1509
01:57:42,622 --> 01:57:44,647
Until then... goodnight!

1510
01:57:50,563 --> 01:57:54,260
Geeta was quite nervous
before her first bout.

1511
01:57:54,634 --> 01:57:56,363
And that was expected.

1512
01:57:56,502 --> 01:58:00,768
So far her performance
in international events had been poor.

1513
01:58:01,541 --> 01:58:06,001
However little... the nation
still had hope on her.

1514
01:58:07,080 --> 01:58:09,674
And this was probably
Geeta's last opportunity,

1515
01:58:09,949 --> 01:58:11,314
to prove herself.

1516
01:58:17,156 --> 01:58:20,319
The first match in women's wrestling,
55-kilo category, is between,

1517
01:58:20,460 --> 01:58:24,226
India's Geeta Kumari and
Melissa Anderson from Wales.

1518
01:58:24,564 --> 01:58:25,963
Go, Geeta!

1519
01:58:26,265 --> 01:58:28,130
Geeta seems quite nervous.

1520
01:58:28,267 --> 01:58:30,667
Now, let's see if she can
break her jinx,

1521
01:58:30,736 --> 01:58:34,672
of losing in the first
couple of rounds.

1522
01:58:35,374 --> 01:58:37,103
We would like to remind
our spectators,

1523
01:58:37,176 --> 01:58:39,440
that there will be three rounds
of two minutes each.

1524
01:58:40,279 --> 01:58:43,373
Whoever wins two rounds,
wins the match.

1525
01:58:46,385 --> 01:58:48,444
With that the match begins.

1526
01:58:50,623 --> 01:58:52,488
Both the wrestlers are quite alert.

1527
01:59:00,666 --> 01:59:02,224
1 point to Melissa.

1528
01:59:02,301 --> 01:59:04,667
Melissa - 1 ; Geeta - 0.

1529
01:59:10,209 --> 01:59:12,973
Melissa seems stronger.

1530
01:59:14,580 --> 01:59:16,172
3 more points to Melissa!

1531
01:59:16,249 --> 01:59:17,375
What are you doing, Geeta?

1532
01:59:18,651 --> 01:59:20,516
Melissa - 4; Geeta - 0.

1533
01:59:20,586 --> 01:59:22,986
If Geeta gives away
2 more points,

1534
01:59:23,122 --> 01:59:26,250
Melissa will win this round
on technical superiority.

1535
01:59:32,498 --> 01:59:34,591
And Melissa gets 2 points!

1536
01:59:37,003 --> 01:59:39,028
Exactly as we feared.

1537
01:59:39,505 --> 01:59:44,374
Melissa has won the first round
on technical superiority; 6-0.

1538
01:59:45,378 --> 01:59:46,367
What are you doing, Geeta?

1539
01:59:47,113 --> 01:59:48,705
Don't lose so badly!

1540
01:59:49,515 --> 01:59:52,678
We now need to see that
after losing the first round badly,

1541
01:59:52,718 --> 01:59:55,619
is Geeta capable of making
a comeback in round two.

1542
02:00:04,263 --> 02:00:06,094
2 points to Melissa.

1543
02:00:07,633 --> 02:00:09,396
1 more point to Melissa.

1544
02:00:10,069 --> 02:00:13,527
The match seems to be
slipping out of Geeta's hands.

1545
02:00:15,241 --> 02:00:17,004
You are not to lose, Geeta!

1546
02:00:24,617 --> 02:00:26,107
Come on, Geeta.

1547
02:00:30,056 --> 02:00:31,614
Geeta, lagging by 3 points.

1548
02:00:32,124 --> 02:00:33,751
She'll have to score real quick.

1549
02:00:42,501 --> 02:00:44,298
2 points to Geeta!

1550
02:00:44,770 --> 02:00:47,432
Melissa - 3; Geeta - 2.

1551
02:00:47,807 --> 02:00:50,139
Geeta tries to score some more,

1552
02:00:50,576 --> 02:00:52,203
but the referee blows the whistle.

1553
02:00:52,612 --> 02:00:54,546
The round is nearing completion.

1554
02:00:54,614 --> 02:00:56,639
Geeta is still behind by a point.

1555
02:01:03,589 --> 02:01:06,387
Geeta in trouble!

1556
02:01:09,228 --> 02:01:11,162
Geeta gets 3 points!

1557
02:01:11,364 --> 02:01:13,696
Geeta - 5; Melissa - 3.

1558
02:01:14,700 --> 02:01:19,296
Just four seconds to go.

1559
02:01:20,606 --> 02:01:22,005
Y es, Geeta!

1560
02:01:25,044 --> 02:01:27,444
Geeta's back in the match!

1561
02:01:27,513 --> 02:01:29,606
It's one round each.

1562
02:01:29,782 --> 02:01:35,220
Geeta has shown that she is not
going to accept defeat so easily.

1563
02:01:35,655 --> 02:01:38,488
It's the last round.

1564
02:01:39,091 --> 02:01:40,683
Play defensive.

1565
02:01:43,229 --> 02:01:44,218
Got it?

1566
02:01:44,630 --> 02:01:46,154
Play attacking!

1567
02:01:54,807 --> 02:01:56,399
And the last round begins.

1568
02:01:57,510 --> 02:01:59,375
Geeta on the attack.

1569
02:02:02,748 --> 02:02:04,272
1 point for Geeta.

1570
02:02:04,650 --> 02:02:07,278
Geeta - 1 ; Melissa - 0.

1571
02:02:16,662 --> 02:02:18,527
2 more points in Geeta's kitty.

1572
02:02:19,031 --> 02:02:21,192
Geeta- 3; Melissa - 0.

1573
02:02:21,701 --> 02:02:24,568
Will she manage to keep her lead?

1574
02:02:26,138 --> 02:02:27,571
Very good. Defend now.

1575
02:02:36,215 --> 02:02:37,739
3 points for Melissa!

1576
02:02:38,084 --> 02:02:39,278
I told you to defend.

1577
02:02:39,452 --> 02:02:41,283
No problem.
Keep attacking!

1578
02:02:41,354 --> 02:02:43,322
The score is equal at 3-3.

1579
02:02:45,658 --> 02:02:47,649
Go for it, Geeta!

1580
02:02:48,260 --> 02:02:50,490
This match can tilt either way.

1581
02:02:50,796 --> 02:02:55,290
Geeta was poised to win
but lost her lead.

1582
02:02:58,204 --> 02:02:59,762
Geeta's in danger.

1583
02:03:00,773 --> 02:03:02,001
Wow! What a move!

1584
02:03:02,074 --> 02:03:03,336
3 points to Geeta!

1585
02:03:03,409 --> 02:03:05,104
Keep her down, Geeta.

1586
02:03:11,117 --> 02:03:14,553
Geeta has won this match!

1587
02:03:16,489 --> 02:03:19,549
India's Geeta Kumari Phogat,

1588
02:03:19,625 --> 02:03:25,461
has proven her critics wrong.

1589
02:03:27,199 --> 02:03:33,104
A proud moment for Geeta's father,
Mahavir Singh Phogat!

1590
02:03:42,381 --> 02:03:44,008
So far lndia has won,

1591
02:03:44,049 --> 02:03:47,280
five gold, 1 3 silver
and seven bronze medals.

1592
02:03:47,720 --> 02:03:50,154
In women's wrestling,
lndia's Geeta Kumari Phogat,

1593
02:03:50,322 --> 02:03:53,758
has entered the semi-finals
of the 55-kilo category.

1594
02:03:54,326 --> 02:03:58,592
Geeta will now face
Nigeria's Naomi Edwards,

1595
02:03:58,664 --> 02:04:00,689
two time world champion.

1596
02:04:01,333 --> 02:04:02,231
What do you think?

1597
02:04:02,301 --> 02:04:04,735
Naomi is a very strong wrestler.

1598
02:04:05,004 --> 02:04:07,302
Extremely aggressive and attacking.

1599
02:04:07,740 --> 02:04:12,541
She doesn't give any
opportunity to her opponent.

1600
02:04:16,916 --> 02:04:20,249
It's not going to be easy
for Geeta this time.

1601
02:04:25,558 --> 02:04:27,583
Today, you played as per your will.

1602
02:04:27,993 --> 02:04:30,291
Now, do as I say.

1603
02:04:30,763 --> 02:04:32,492
Or it's impossible to win.

1604
02:04:32,565 --> 02:04:35,125
It's a difficult one,

1605
02:04:35,468 --> 02:04:37,026
but not impossible.

1606
02:04:38,237 --> 02:04:40,603
You'll have to play offensive!

1607
02:04:40,706 --> 02:04:42,571
You have to play defensive.

1608
02:04:42,641 --> 02:04:44,268
Just go for the points!

1609
02:04:44,343 --> 02:04:46,709
Don't go for the points.

1610
02:04:46,779 --> 02:04:48,679
You'll get a lot of opportunities.

1611
02:04:48,747 --> 02:04:52,308
Don't give her any opportunities
because she won't give you any.

1612
02:04:52,618 --> 02:04:54,711
Force a lock-jam each time.

1613
02:04:55,521 --> 02:04:58,081
If she doesn't get to score,
she'll get frustrated,

1614
02:04:58,324 --> 02:04:59,621
and will give you an opportunity.

1615
02:04:59,758 --> 02:05:02,625
That's the moment
we should grab!

1616
02:05:03,696 --> 02:05:07,132
The first semi-final match in
the 55-kilo category.

1617
02:05:07,333 --> 02:05:11,326
India's Geeta Kumari
versus Nigeria's Naomi Edwards.

1618
02:05:15,274 --> 02:05:17,572
Naomi attacking from the start.

1619
02:05:18,511 --> 02:05:21,412
And against her nature,
Geeta playing defensive.

1620
02:05:23,115 --> 02:05:24,582
Naomi attacks!

1621
02:05:24,650 --> 02:05:26,618
Geeta in trouble.

1622
02:05:26,652 --> 02:05:29,587
Geeta putting up a strong defense.

1623
02:05:30,022 --> 02:05:32,013
Geeta holding her back.

1624
02:05:37,329 --> 02:05:39,354
Naomi made a strong attempt.

1625
02:05:39,565 --> 02:05:41,590
But Geeta held her own.

1626
02:05:42,334 --> 02:05:43,528
Go on the attack!

1627
02:05:44,303 --> 02:05:45,531
Go easy.

1628
02:05:47,139 --> 02:05:48,470
Naomi gets rough.

1629
02:05:48,774 --> 02:05:50,605
She seems frustrated.

1630
02:05:52,177 --> 02:05:54,509
Naomi twisting Geeta's wrist.

1631
02:06:00,486 --> 02:06:04,616
Naomi is being given a warning.

1632
02:06:04,657 --> 02:06:06,420
Hang in there, Geeta!

1633
02:06:18,637 --> 02:06:20,366
That's 3 points for Naomi!

1634
02:06:21,340 --> 02:06:23,501
Geeta had been
holding her off well.

1635
02:06:23,576 --> 02:06:24,668
A really good effort,

1636
02:06:24,743 --> 02:06:26,973
but Naomi's broken
through her defense.

1637
02:06:29,248 --> 02:06:31,739
Geeta has to act fast.

1638
02:06:38,290 --> 02:06:39,689
Geeta takes Naomi down.

1639
02:06:39,758 --> 02:06:41,020
1 point to Geeta!

1640
02:06:41,093 --> 02:06:42,458
She's still trying.

1641
02:06:48,567 --> 02:06:50,296
And time's up!

1642
02:06:50,536 --> 02:06:54,028
Geeta played well,
but she's lost this first round.

1643
02:06:54,707 --> 02:06:55,765
What are you doing, Geeta?

1644
02:06:56,342 --> 02:06:57,604
Why don't you attack?

1645
02:07:04,717 --> 02:07:07,185
The second round begins.

1646
02:07:14,994 --> 02:07:16,120
Naomi attacks.

1647
02:07:33,012 --> 02:07:34,741
Naomi tries to flip Geeta.

1648
02:07:35,014 --> 02:07:37,346
But Geeta defends well.

1649
02:07:41,120 --> 02:07:42,712
Naomi puts all her strength,

1650
02:07:43,155 --> 02:07:46,056
but Geeta isn't giving her a chance.

1651
02:07:46,725 --> 02:07:49,216
This is an exciting match.

1652
02:07:50,596 --> 02:07:52,757
Naomi trying hard,

1653
02:07:53,332 --> 02:07:55,562
but Geeta not giving her space.

1654
02:07:56,769 --> 02:07:59,329
Naomi attacks again.

1655
02:07:59,672 --> 02:08:01,196
Geeta defends.

1656
02:08:08,947 --> 02:08:11,074
A nice defense by Geeta.

1657
02:08:24,329 --> 02:08:26,320
The referee breaks the fight.

1658
02:08:26,398 --> 02:08:28,696
Second round is still 0-0.

1659
02:08:29,435 --> 02:08:35,169
Naomi must be wondering
how to break Geeta's defense.

1660
02:08:38,711 --> 02:08:41,578
"If she doesn't get to score,
she'll get frustrated,

1661
02:08:42,014 --> 02:08:42,742
and will give you an opportunity. "

1662
02:08:43,148 --> 02:08:44,547
Naomi attacks.

1663
02:08:45,684 --> 02:08:47,743
"That's the moment
we should grab! "

1664
02:08:51,323 --> 02:08:53,223
3 points!

1665
02:08:53,525 --> 02:08:57,359
And Geeta wins this round, 3-0.

1666
02:08:59,732 --> 02:09:01,063
Naomi, look at me.

1667
02:09:01,567 --> 02:09:02,556
That girl, she's smart.

1668
02:09:02,634 --> 02:09:03,692
But you are double smart.

1669
02:09:04,169 --> 02:09:05,033
Okay?

1670
02:09:05,204 --> 02:09:07,001
Don't allow her to turn you easily.

1671
02:09:07,139 --> 02:09:08,197
How are you fighting?

1672
02:09:08,440 --> 02:09:12,035
Sir, I am fighting as I have learnt.

1673
02:09:14,613 --> 02:09:16,706
The third and final round has started.

1674
02:09:19,017 --> 02:09:20,348
It's interesting to see,

1675
02:09:20,419 --> 02:09:23,650
that Naomi is now
playing cautiously.

1676
02:09:42,741 --> 02:09:44,641
Naomi trying real hard.

1677
02:09:45,043 --> 02:09:47,102
But Geeta holding her back.

1678
02:09:47,646 --> 02:09:49,409
It's a lock position again.

1679
02:09:56,688 --> 02:09:58,053
Naomi attacks again.

1680
02:09:58,457 --> 02:10:00,152
Geeta holds her back.

1681
02:10:02,694 --> 02:10:04,662
Will Naomi score?

1682
02:10:06,031 --> 02:10:08,056
Hold on, Geeta!

1683
02:10:14,072 --> 02:10:16,563
The score stands at 0-0.

1684
02:10:17,075 --> 02:10:18,633
Naomi tries harder.

1685
02:10:21,647 --> 02:10:24,411
Geeta is exposed here
but holds her back.

1686
02:10:39,398 --> 02:10:41,696
Geeta hanging on
by the skin of her teeth.

1687
02:10:42,067 --> 02:10:44,297
Only 1 2 seconds left.

1688
02:10:45,204 --> 02:10:47,297
The score still 0-0.

1689
02:10:49,074 --> 02:10:50,405
Geeta attacks!

1690
02:10:57,683 --> 02:11:01,642
With that this round is tied at 0-0.

1691
02:11:02,187 --> 02:11:03,984
She could have scored.

1692
02:11:04,389 --> 02:11:05,617
Now there'll be a toss.

1693
02:11:06,124 --> 02:11:08,251
Now there will be a toss.

1694
02:11:08,493 --> 02:11:11,087
This is known as a 'clinch'.

1695
02:11:11,496 --> 02:11:15,626
The wrestler who wins the toss
gets to choose a grip,

1696
02:11:16,301 --> 02:11:19,429
and gets 30 seconds to score.

1697
02:11:20,205 --> 02:11:23,038
If the red side falls up,
Naomi gets to attack,

1698
02:11:23,308 --> 02:11:26,004
if it's blue, Geeta gets to attack.

1699
02:11:26,278 --> 02:11:28,746
In 99 percent of the cases
the one who wins the toss,

1700
02:11:29,014 --> 02:11:30,379
wins the match.

1701
02:11:43,328 --> 02:11:44,590
Oh!

1702
02:11:44,663 --> 02:11:48,121
Maybe even destiny
doesn't want Geeta to win.

1703
02:11:49,568 --> 02:11:53,163
It's next to impossible to defend
against Naomi for 30 seconds.

1704
02:11:55,340 --> 02:11:57,069
Which leg do you choose?
- Right.

1705
02:11:57,242 --> 02:11:59,802
Naomi has chosen
Geeta's right leg.

1706
02:12:00,545 --> 02:12:02,740
Geeta takes a defensive position.

1707
02:12:04,016 --> 02:12:06,314
Naomi takes her grip of choice.

1708
02:12:07,319 --> 02:12:08,752
Now, Geeta has two options.

1709
02:12:09,655 --> 02:12:11,714
Not allow Naomi to score
for 30 seconds,

1710
02:12:11,990 --> 02:12:14,254
or score herself,
and win the match.

1711
02:12:15,360 --> 02:12:19,694
In this position against Naomi,
both are almost impossible.

1712
02:12:36,014 --> 02:12:38,346
She lifts Geeta!

1713
02:12:42,587 --> 02:12:45,522
And Geeta scores a point!

1714
02:12:50,762 --> 02:12:54,357
No one expected
Geeta to win this match.

1715
02:12:55,233 --> 02:12:59,727
She has beaten the number one
contender for gold,

1716
02:12:59,805 --> 02:13:03,002
in this very exciting clinch,

1717
02:13:03,075 --> 02:13:06,044
and entered the finals!

1718
02:13:06,745 --> 02:13:09,680
And let's hope that
Geeta Phogat,

1719
02:13:10,115 --> 02:13:13,448
maintains her wonderful form
in the finals too.

1720
02:13:33,305 --> 02:13:34,636
Shall we go, uncle?

1721
02:13:35,173 --> 02:13:36,697
Let's see the next match.

1722
02:13:37,209 --> 02:13:39,700
Let's find out whether Geeta's finals
is against the Australian,

1723
02:13:40,078 --> 02:13:41,238
or the Scottish wrestler.

1724
02:13:41,947 --> 02:13:43,676
I'm very proud of Geeta.

1725
02:13:44,149 --> 02:13:47,118
She followed my strategy to the T.

1726
02:13:47,452 --> 02:13:49,249
The result is in front of you.

1727
02:13:50,222 --> 02:13:51,553
Here she comes.

1728
02:13:53,725 --> 02:13:55,454
She looks good.

1729
02:13:56,728 --> 02:13:58,423
I mean... as a wrestler.

1730
02:14:00,332 --> 02:14:03,529
Uncle, isn't she the
same one from the DVD?

1731
02:14:05,404 --> 02:14:06,962
Angelina Watson.

1732
02:14:07,339 --> 02:14:09,307
She's defeated Geeta twice.

1733
02:14:11,109 --> 02:14:13,202
She's played well till now.

1734
02:14:13,745 --> 02:14:15,542
And she'll play well
in the finals too.

1735
02:14:20,652 --> 02:14:23,678
I've always had faith in Geeta.

1736
02:14:24,289 --> 02:14:27,622
Sooner or later she had to
win an international medal.

1737
02:14:32,664 --> 02:14:34,427
A silver is guaranteed now!

1738
02:14:41,139 --> 02:14:42,538
The final won't be so easy.

1739
02:14:43,442 --> 02:14:44,340
Geeta-ji,

1740
02:14:44,743 --> 02:14:46,574
your game has changed dramatically.

1741
02:14:46,745 --> 02:14:48,178
How did this happen?

1742
02:14:53,418 --> 02:14:56,410
The entire credit for this,

1743
02:14:56,621 --> 02:14:58,145
goes to my father.

1744
02:15:01,560 --> 02:15:04,324
He never stopped believing in me.

1745
02:15:13,972 --> 02:15:14,666
Mahavir-ji!

1746
02:15:15,674 --> 02:15:17,266
Hello, Mr. Shamim.

1747
02:15:17,375 --> 02:15:19,104
Congratulations, Mahavir-ji!

1748
02:15:19,177 --> 02:15:20,644
Geeta fought very well.

1749
02:15:20,745 --> 02:15:23,373
All of Balali is proud.

1750
02:15:23,548 --> 02:15:25,038
And these girls insisted,

1751
02:15:25,117 --> 02:15:27,278
on watching Geeta's match
in the stadium,

1752
02:15:27,352 --> 02:15:28,512
or they won't eat.

1753
02:15:31,022 --> 02:15:32,080
How did you like the match?

1754
02:15:32,157 --> 02:15:33,283
Loved it!

1755
02:15:33,358 --> 02:15:35,417
Give this to her.

1756
02:15:36,761 --> 02:15:37,591
What is this?

1757
02:15:37,729 --> 02:15:38,991
I prayed for her.

1758
02:15:39,131 --> 02:15:40,689
Tomorrow is the final.

1759
02:15:44,069 --> 02:15:44,626
Bless you!

1760
02:15:45,237 --> 02:15:46,727
How can we allow this, sir?

1761
02:15:47,272 --> 02:15:50,002
Mahavir Singh is shouting instructions
to Geeta from the audience.

1762
02:15:50,208 --> 02:15:52,733
The poor thing is getting confused
whether to listen to him or me.

1763
02:15:55,046 --> 02:15:58,209
From her game, it sure doesn't
seem like she's confused.

1764
02:16:00,152 --> 02:16:03,349
Besides, how can we ask
the audience to remain silent?

1765
02:16:04,356 --> 02:16:05,380
Aren't you the coach?

1766
02:16:06,992 --> 02:16:08,425
She should be listening to you.

1767
02:16:08,660 --> 02:16:10,685
No, sir... she is listening to me.

1768
02:16:11,429 --> 02:16:13,693
That's why she's winning.
- Then what's the problem?

1769
02:16:16,234 --> 02:16:18,031
You wanted a bronze, right?

1770
02:16:19,437 --> 02:16:22,463
It's quite possible that
tomorrow she may win gold.

1771
02:16:23,542 --> 02:16:24,372
No?

1772
02:16:26,411 --> 02:16:30,677
I'm surprised she's made it so far
but I am happy for her.

1773
02:16:31,116 --> 02:16:33,550
It should be an interesting
final tomorrow.

1774
02:16:33,618 --> 02:16:36,644
Playing an lndian
in front of an lndian crowd.

1775
02:16:37,122 --> 02:16:38,646
Beating her, of course!

1776
02:16:38,757 --> 02:16:41,385
Angelina, any pressure
before the finals?

1777
02:16:41,493 --> 02:16:45,293
Yeah, I'm sure she must be
under tremendous pressure.

1778
02:16:46,131 --> 02:16:47,621
I've beaten her twice.

1779
02:16:48,066 --> 02:16:49,192
First round?
- Yeah.

1780
02:16:49,267 --> 02:16:50,666
Yeah, first round.

1781
02:16:51,403 --> 02:16:53,337
So, thank you and,

1782
02:16:53,405 --> 02:16:54,497
Namaste!

1783
02:17:00,512 --> 02:17:02,412
What's the strategy
for tomorrow, papa?

1784
02:17:10,422 --> 02:17:13,357
There is only one strategy
for tomorrow, child.

1785
02:17:14,459 --> 02:17:18,327
You have to fight in a way
that people remember you.

1786
02:17:21,499 --> 02:17:23,296
If you win silver,

1787
02:17:23,969 --> 02:17:26,460
sooner or later
you'll be forgotten.

1788
02:17:28,373 --> 02:17:32,332
If you win gold,
you will become an example.

1789
02:17:34,079 --> 02:17:37,981
And examples are given, child...
not forgotten.

1790
02:17:43,188 --> 02:17:45,247
See those girls?

1791
02:17:47,325 --> 02:17:49,759
If you win tomorrow,
you will not win alone.

1792
02:17:50,562 --> 02:17:54,328
Millions of girls like them
will win along with you.

1793
02:17:56,768 --> 02:18:01,137
It'll be a victory for every girl who
is considered inferior to boys;

1794
02:18:01,573 --> 02:18:04,201
who is forced
into household chores,

1795
02:18:04,276 --> 02:18:07,211
who is married off
to just raise children.

1796
02:18:09,714 --> 02:18:13,445
Tomorrow's match is
the most important one.

1797
02:18:16,187 --> 02:18:19,315
Because tomorrow you won't be
fighting just that Australian

1798
02:18:19,624 --> 02:18:24,254
but all those people
who think less of girls.

1799
02:18:32,137 --> 02:18:34,731
The finals of the women's wrestling,
Commonwealth Games 201 0,

1800
02:18:35,140 --> 02:18:38,007
55-kilo category, is about to begin.

1801
02:18:38,276 --> 02:18:43,043
India's Geeta Kumari versus
Australia's Angelina Watson.

1802
02:18:44,115 --> 02:18:46,447
We'd like to remind you all,

1803
02:18:46,518 --> 02:18:50,147
that never before has
an Indian female wrestler,

1804
02:18:50,588 --> 02:18:53,580
ever won gold in the
Commonwealth Games.

1805
02:18:54,426 --> 02:18:56,587
In this crowd, we see,

1806
02:18:57,295 --> 02:19:00,924
a lot of hope, enthusiasm
and the Indian flag.

1807
02:19:18,216 --> 02:19:19,478
Hello, sir!

1808
02:19:19,551 --> 02:19:21,212
Aren't you Mahavir Singh-ji?

1809
02:19:21,286 --> 02:19:22,617
Geeta's father?
- Yes.

1810
02:19:22,687 --> 02:19:23,654
A moment please.

1811
02:19:24,055 --> 02:19:27,491
The chairman of the Wrestling
Federation wants to meet you.

1812
02:19:27,559 --> 02:19:29,049
Some important matter.

1813
02:19:29,694 --> 02:19:32,288
I'll meet him later.
It's my daughter's match.

1814
02:19:32,397 --> 02:19:34,558
He's a big man.
He might get offended.

1815
02:19:34,632 --> 02:19:37,066
Just two minutes.

1816
02:19:40,472 --> 02:19:41,734
You carry on. I'll be there.

1817
02:19:47,412 --> 02:19:50,347
"The entire credit for this
goes to my father."

1818
02:19:51,249 --> 02:19:53,183
Go... take the credit.

1819
02:20:04,062 --> 02:20:05,188
How much further is it?

1820
02:20:05,263 --> 02:20:06,594
We are almost there, sir.

1821
02:20:14,272 --> 02:20:15,762
Where have you got me?

1822
02:20:17,342 --> 02:20:19,401
Hey, brother!

1823
02:20:19,644 --> 02:20:22,078
What are you doing, brother?

1824
02:20:24,215 --> 02:20:28,618
A thunderous applause for Geeta
as she walks in.

1825
02:20:29,487 --> 02:20:31,114
Is anyone there?

1826
02:20:33,558 --> 02:20:34,684
Hello!

1827
02:20:35,493 --> 02:20:37,154
Anyone there?

1828
02:20:37,796 --> 02:20:39,354
This is the final.

1829
02:20:39,597 --> 02:20:41,030
Play carefully.

1830
02:21:11,496 --> 02:21:15,364
Angelina Watson enters the stadium.

1831
02:21:26,511 --> 02:21:30,003
And the final match begins.

1832
02:21:30,081 --> 02:21:31,673
Go for gold, Geeta!

1833
02:21:38,156 --> 02:21:41,353
Angelina, aggressive
from the start.

1834
02:21:42,160 --> 02:21:43,593
She attacks.

1835
02:21:47,532 --> 02:21:48,624
Geeta defends.

1836
02:21:53,438 --> 02:21:55,497
And 3 points for Geeta!

1837
02:21:55,707 --> 02:21:59,108
Geeta takes a big lead
right from the start.

1838
02:21:59,511 --> 02:22:02,309
Geeta - 3; Angelina - 0.

1839
02:22:03,047 --> 02:22:03,672
Good... good!

1840
02:22:19,297 --> 02:22:21,128
Another point for Geeta.

1841
02:22:22,333 --> 02:22:25,564
Geeta - 4; Angelina - 0.

1842
02:22:26,204 --> 02:22:28,502
Geeta playing very well.

1843
02:22:35,713 --> 02:22:37,613
Angelina will need to act fast.

1844
02:22:47,559 --> 02:22:49,459
1 point to Angelina.

1845
02:22:50,762 --> 02:22:53,424
Angelina looks for a takedown.

1846
02:22:55,600 --> 02:22:57,363
Geeta defends well.

1847
02:22:57,802 --> 02:22:59,235
Referee whistles.

1848
02:22:59,337 --> 02:23:02,101
Geeta leads, 4- 1.

1849
02:23:07,478 --> 02:23:12,006
1 point to Geeta.
Geeta- 5; Angelina - 1.

1850
02:23:12,450 --> 02:23:16,181
And with this, Geeta Kumari
wins the first round quite easily.

1851
02:23:16,254 --> 02:23:18,620
Perhaps Angelina is realizing,

1852
02:23:19,190 --> 02:23:20,555
that this is not the same Geeta,

1853
02:23:20,625 --> 02:23:23,025
whom she had defeated
easily in the past.

1854
02:23:52,657 --> 02:23:54,488
And the second round starts.

1855
02:23:54,726 --> 02:23:57,456
Will Geeta win this round
and create history?

1856
02:24:02,166 --> 02:24:04,100
An excellent takedown!
1 point to Geeta.

1857
02:24:04,435 --> 02:24:07,427
Geeta - 1 ; Angelina - 0.

1858
02:24:09,207 --> 02:24:11,004
Go... Geeta, go!

1859
02:24:19,751 --> 02:24:21,548
2 more points for Geeta!

1860
02:24:21,619 --> 02:24:24,588
Geeta - 3; Angelina - 0.

1861
02:24:25,056 --> 02:24:27,616
Geeta bearing down on Angelina.

1862
02:24:32,163 --> 02:24:33,630
Geeta attacks!

1863
02:24:34,432 --> 02:24:36,366
1 point for Geeta.

1864
02:24:37,568 --> 02:24:38,432
Two more points,

1865
02:24:38,503 --> 02:24:40,471
and she'll win this round
by technical superiority,

1866
02:24:40,538 --> 02:24:42,199
and the championship!

1867
02:24:42,707 --> 02:24:45,039
Geeta bearing down
with all her might.

1868
02:24:45,276 --> 02:24:47,141
Will Geeta win?

1869
02:24:48,680 --> 02:24:51,148
The referee's whistle saves Angelina!

1870
02:24:51,215 --> 02:24:52,682
No problem... Geeta!

1871
02:24:57,388 --> 02:24:59,379
Angelina seems furious.

1872
02:25:04,295 --> 02:25:08,129
1 point for Angelina.
Angelina - 1 ; Geeta - 4.

1873
02:25:08,199 --> 02:25:10,030
Geeta is still in danger.

1874
02:25:11,202 --> 02:25:13,067
2 more points for Angelina.

1875
02:25:14,172 --> 02:25:16,538
Geeta - 4; Angelina - 3.

1876
02:25:20,478 --> 02:25:22,173
No problem... come on!

1877
02:25:22,213 --> 02:25:24,511
Geeta still leads by 1 point.

1878
02:25:24,716 --> 02:25:27,549
She needs to hold on to it
a little longer.

1879
02:25:29,087 --> 02:25:31,248
Will Geeta retain this lead?

1880
02:25:33,491 --> 02:25:35,083
Time is running out.

1881
02:25:35,293 --> 02:25:36,658
Geeta defends well.

1882
02:25:37,095 --> 02:25:39,120
Angelina going all out.

1883
02:25:40,698 --> 02:25:42,723
3 points to Angelina!

1884
02:25:43,101 --> 02:25:45,626
Angelina - 6; Geeta - 4.

1885
02:25:50,408 --> 02:25:52,638
And this round comes to an end.

1886
02:25:54,612 --> 02:25:58,708
And Angelina has shown
what a true champion is made of!

1887
02:25:59,517 --> 02:26:02,111
What are you doing?
You could've won the match!

1888
02:26:11,195 --> 02:26:13,720
Angelina, with renewed enthusiasm.

1889
02:26:16,200 --> 02:26:20,500
It's not going to be
easy for Geeta.

1890
02:26:21,139 --> 02:26:23,369
Angelina aggressive
from the start.

1891
02:26:30,715 --> 02:26:34,048
3 points for Angelina!

1892
02:26:34,585 --> 02:26:37,986
A 3-point lead in the final round!

1893
02:26:39,290 --> 02:26:42,157
Angelina - 3; Geeta - 0.

1894
02:26:54,338 --> 02:26:56,431
1 point more to Angelina.

1895
02:26:57,175 --> 02:27:00,201
Angelina - 4; Geeta - 0.

1896
02:27:00,578 --> 02:27:04,378
And this match leaning
in favour of Angelina.

1897
02:27:04,615 --> 02:27:10,076
If Geeta has to get back,
she needs to score fast.

1898
02:27:16,127 --> 02:27:18,095
A clever move by Geeta.

1899
02:27:20,698 --> 02:27:23,132
1 point to Geeta!

1900
02:27:25,436 --> 02:27:28,530
Angelina - 4; Geeta - 1.

1901
02:27:29,240 --> 02:27:31,208
Time... running out.

1902
02:27:31,409 --> 02:27:33,468
Geeta needs to keep at it.

1903
02:27:33,611 --> 02:27:36,512
But carefully, because if
Angelina scores again,

1904
02:27:36,647 --> 02:27:39,138
it'll be impossible
to make a come back.

1905
02:27:45,223 --> 02:27:46,212
Geeta attacks,

1906
02:27:46,290 --> 02:27:48,315
but Angelina scores a point!

1907
02:27:50,394 --> 02:27:53,295
Angelina - 5; Geeta - 1.

1908
02:27:54,699 --> 02:28:00,433
It's almost impossible now
for Geeta to make a comeback!

1909
02:28:09,513 --> 02:28:11,640
"Remember!"

1910
02:28:13,251 --> 02:28:16,220
"Your papa won't be there
to save you every time. "

1911
02:28:16,988 --> 02:28:18,615
"l can only teach you to fight."

1912
02:28:18,723 --> 02:28:20,315
"But you have to fight yourself."

1913
02:28:20,458 --> 02:28:22,949
"Make the effort...
save yourself."

1914
02:28:30,067 --> 02:28:32,160
Only 22 seconds left.

1915
02:28:32,737 --> 02:28:36,173
And Geeta is trailing by 4 points.

1916
02:28:37,108 --> 02:28:45,015
At this level, it's almost impossible
to cover this lead in such short time.

1917
02:28:56,327 --> 02:28:59,626
"T o score five points is difficult,

1918
02:29:01,132 --> 02:29:02,997
but it can be done. "

1919
02:29:05,136 --> 02:29:07,036
Geeta trying.

1920
02:29:07,305 --> 02:29:09,273
But Angelina stalling for time.

1921
02:29:12,443 --> 02:29:15,207
Just a few seconds left.

1922
02:29:15,479 --> 02:29:19,677
And India might have to
settle for a silver.

1923
02:29:44,442 --> 02:29:47,172
"You have to play with
the opponent's mind. "

1924
02:29:49,513 --> 02:29:51,504
"Fake a move,

1925
02:29:51,582 --> 02:29:53,015
but make another."

1926
02:30:00,524 --> 02:30:03,186
And a fantastic move by Geeta.

1927
02:30:05,296 --> 02:30:08,060
Will time be on her side?

1928
02:30:48,506 --> 02:30:50,474
It's a gold for Geeta!

1929
02:30:54,078 --> 02:30:59,209
Geeta has achieved
the impossible!

1930
02:30:59,550 --> 02:31:02,144
She is the first ever
female Indian wrestler,

1931
02:31:02,219 --> 02:31:04,710
to win gold at the
Commonwealth Games!

1932
02:31:06,157 --> 02:31:09,991
Who would have thought that
a girl from a small village in India,

1933
02:31:10,261 --> 02:31:13,526
is capable of leaving her mark
on the whole world!

1934
02:31:15,199 --> 02:31:16,166
Well done, Geeta!

1935
02:31:16,734 --> 02:31:19,669
A proud moment for India indeed!

1936
02:32:05,382 --> 02:32:06,542
Champion!

1937
02:32:06,650 --> 02:32:08,015
Where's papa?

1938
02:32:08,586 --> 02:32:09,553
I don't know.

1939
02:32:09,620 --> 02:32:11,144
We came together though.

1940
02:32:24,568 --> 02:32:26,399
And now the gold medal,

1941
02:32:26,704 --> 02:32:29,537
for India's Geeta Kumari Phogat.

1942
02:32:35,212 --> 02:32:37,373
And now, as per tradition,

1943
02:32:38,082 --> 02:32:41,347
the national anthem of the
winning country will play.

1944
02:33:43,247 --> 02:33:46,375
Victory to lndia!

1945
02:33:52,156 --> 02:33:54,090
Hey! What are you doing here?

1946
02:34:18,015 --> 02:34:21,348
Geeta, come...
the media is waiting.

1947
02:34:21,752 --> 02:34:22,616
Come.

1948
02:34:24,321 --> 02:34:25,754
Come. Everyone is waiting.

1949
02:34:28,192 --> 02:34:29,181
Come... come.

1950
02:35:30,220 --> 02:35:34,384
And finally uncle uttered
those golden words,
