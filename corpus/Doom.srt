172
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,314
It stays ours at all costs.

173
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,675
Mac, stay here with our friend
and secure the door.

174
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,910
<i>Men, on me. Let's move out.</i>

175
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,274
Open the door.

176
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,836
Who called in the military?

177
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,713
Where the fuck are we?

178
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,189
Couple million light years
from breakfast.

179
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,396
When can I start evacuating people
out through the Ark?

180
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,755
We're at Level 5 quarantine,
nobody goes anywhere.

181
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:46,913
Ladies, we're under
Level 5 quarantine...

182
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,390
<i>so I'm just gonna have to
strip search you girls.</i>

183
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,313
<i>- I don't think so.
- Hold that thought.</i>

184
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,358
<i>We're under Level 5 quarantine,
so I'm just gonna have...</i>

185
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,112
- to strip...
- Portman!

186
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,839
Sergeant, this is Dr Samantha
Grimm, the UAC science officer...

187
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,911
assigned to retrieve
data from the lab.

188
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,991
- Sergeant.
- Dr. Grimm.

189
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,389
- Hello, John.
- Hello, Samantha.

190
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,833
Hello, Samantha!

191
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,511
Sarge, this operation is a code red.

192
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,636
<i>We really don't have room
for passengers.</i>

193
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,996
Excuse me, but I have orders
to retrieve data from three servers:

194
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:20,197
Anthropology, Forensic Archaeology,
and Genetics.

195
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,436
This is a military operation,
Doctor.

196
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:25,432
We're really not here
to retrieve your science homework.

197
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:29,115
<i>Look, I got an idea. Why don't you
ask your CO what your orders are?</i>

198
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,353
To contain and neutralise
the threat, protect the civilians...

199
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:38,069
and retrieve UAC property.

200
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,393
We finally done here?
Because I've got a job to do.

201
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,194
- Lf you'll follow me?
- You chose this, Reaper.

202
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,035
- Is this gonna spoil my day?
- No, sir.

203
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,190
<i>Tell me you didn't let
a fine-Iooking piece of ass...</i>

204
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,350
<i>- like that get away from you.
- She's my sister.</i>

205
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,351
<i>- No shit?
- Don't do this again, man.</i>

206
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,475
Do what?

207
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,195
<i>There's three sections to
Carmack's lab complex.</i>

208
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,589
Archaeology, Genetics,
and Weapons Research.

209
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,671
<i>- You test weapons up here?
- Well, it's a dead planet.</i>

210
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:05,149
<i>You want that tested here, where
it's safe, or in your own backyard?</i>

211
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,834
We're primarily
an archaeological operation.

212
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,229
Weapons Research is
in its own separate facility.

213
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,629
<i>It has nothing to do
with Dr Carmack's work.</i>

214
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,278
How many inside
when the lab shut down?

215
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,828
<i>Only Dr Carmack's team.
That's six people.</i>

216
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,673
In one of the carbon dating labs,
there was an internal phone...

217
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,829
left off the hook.

218
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,070
Did you get any information from it?

219
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,194
Open the door.

220
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,470
Portman, Goat, lead on.

221
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,868
<i>Magnesium, chromium, lead.
It's all normal.</i>

222
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,188
All clear.

223
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,636
Pinky, give us a schematic.

224
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,358
Uploading to you now.

225
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,395
<i>Carmack's lab is isolated
from the rest of the facility.</i>

226
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,875
<i>The airlock is the only way
in or out.</i>

227
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,279
Goat, Portman: Genetics.

228
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:21,318
<i>Kid, Destroyer: Carmack's office,
where he sent the mayday from.</i>

229
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:24,073
Reaper, keep Dr Grimm here safe
on her salvage op.

230
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,994
<i>Duke and I'll take the weapons lab,
make sure all the hardware's secure.</i>

231
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,638
Be safe, gentlemen.

232
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,116
<i>- Portman, Goat, on you.
- It's on.</i>

233
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,832
- Clear left.
- Clear right.

234
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,313
<i>$5 says this shit ain't nothing but
a disgruntled employee with a gun.</i>

235
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:59,352
Fluorescent markings as rooms
are cleared. Go.

236
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,752
They're on the move.

237
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,552
<i>You don't look like a "Mac."</i>

238
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:14,234
Katsuhiko Kumanosuke Takaashi.

239
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,233
So, Mac.

240
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,394
What the fuck!

241
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,155
Pinky, you getting this?

242
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,395
Jesus.

243
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,799
<i>Very cool.</i>

244
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,475
Cleared.

245
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,830
Where the hell is everybody?

246
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,595
Hey.

247
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,115
Lock in.

248
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,675
<i>It's clear.</i>

249
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,437
How much time you gonna need?

250
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,351
Thirty minutes, tops.

251
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,438
<i>Goat, Portman.</i>

252
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,238
<i>There's another room to the north.</i>

253
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,833
<i>Past Genetics.</i>

254
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,514
Copy that.

255
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:07,033
- What the hell is that?
- You never did time, Portman?

256
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,155
What?

257
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:13,869
- This is a holding cell.
- Bullshit.

258
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,192
What makes you think that?

259
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,029
Touch it.

260
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:27,279
- 'Cause the walls are electrified.
- You asshole!

261
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,400
Jeez. They leave shit like this
lying around?

262
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:39,274
<i>I'd hate to see what they lock up.</i>

263
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,069
<i>"BFG."</i>

264
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,800
<i>Hey, Sarge,
what's the deal with the sister?</i>

265
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,553
<i>Reaper's parents led the first team
of archaeologists to Olduvai.</i>

266
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:04,108
They died in some accident
when he was a kid.

267
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:09,274
She followed in their footsteps,
and he didn't.

268
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:12,757
No, what I meant was, is she single?

269
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,716
<i>Please provide DNA verification.</i>

270
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,276
<i>Access denied.</i>

271
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,798
All units report contact.

272
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,676
<i>God damn it,
all units report contact.</i>

273
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,633
It was moving.

274
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,194
<i>Friendly fire, Sarge.
Wasting ghosts.</i>

275
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,271
Roger that. Funny, Duke.

276
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:20,233
So, "Reaper?" As in "Grim?"

277
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,831
They're Marines, Sam, not poets.

278
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,073
Holy shit!

279
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,513
Oh, yeah, meet Lucy.

280
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,232
Lucy, this is my brother, John...

281
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,151
another creature
from the long lost past.

282
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,834
- You found human remains?
- Humanoid.

283
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,354
Lucy and her child
were our first major find.

284
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,476
We're bringing out more every day.

285
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:43,475
- You re-opened the dig?
- I know I should have told you.

286
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,751
<i>I didn't figure it was
the sort of thing...</i>

287
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,229
I could jot down on
a yearly birthday card.

288
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,511
<i>- It's been stabilised.
- Bullshit.</i>

289
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,793
You wanna talk about safe?
Like you took a desk job?

290
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,312
<i>I'm a forensic archaeologist, John.
I'll go where the work is.</i>

291
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,391
Is that the only reason
you're up here?

292
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,357
<i>You wanna know why I'm up here?</i>

293
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,992
I'll show you. Come here.

294
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,958
<i>This is Lucy's chromosome profile.
Notice anything?</i>

295
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,475
My molecular genetics
is a little rusty.

296
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:16,353
<i>What's the first thing
Dad taught us to look for?</i>

297
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,550
<i>She's got 24 pairs of chromosomes.</i>

298
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:28,950
- Humans only have 23.
- But what does the extra pair do?

299
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,553
Makes her superhuman.

300
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,671
The extra pair makes
her super strong...

301
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,069
super fit, super intelligent.

302
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,834
Her cells divide 50 times faster...

303
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:40,195
meaning she heals almost instantly.

304
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:43,320
The fossil record indicates
these people had conquered disease.

305
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,914
We found no genetic disorders,
no viruses, no cancers.

306
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,475
So what,
they were just naturally superior?

307
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,039
No. Not naturally.

308
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,433
See, the earliest remains
we found only had 23.

309
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,833
We suspect this extra
chromosome may be synthetic.

310
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,354
Bioengineered?

311
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,236
<i>That's a long word for a Marine.</i>

312
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,509
Does it ever bother you...

313
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,192
you could've spent your life
looking in a microscope...

314
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,952
instead of a sniper scope?

315
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:13,193
If they were so smart,
how come they're so dead?

316
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,468
<i>We don't know.</i>

317
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,350
Maybe they just went with time.

318
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,630
<i>You don't shield a baby from time.</i>

319
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,598
<i>We got movement up ahead.</i>

320
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:29,070
You stay here, okay? Lock the door.

321
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,316
Fucking door has been ripped open.

322
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,188
<i>There's something
in Carmack's office.</i>

323
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,915
There!

324
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,229
Contact!

325
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:44,039
<i>Moving east
through Carmack's office! Fast!</i>

326
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,837
<i>Confirmed contact.
Moving fast, over south corridor.</i>

327
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,714
Hold your fire!

328
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:04,073
If you have a weapon, drop it.

329
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,389
<i>Don't move.</i>

330
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,712
- Sam, I told you to stay...
- But he knows me, John.

331
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,800
<i>Dr Carmack, it's me. Samantha.</i>

332
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,637
Where are the others?
Where are they?

333
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,438
<i>Steve, Hillary...</i>

334
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,038
<i>I'm not gonna hurt you.</i>

335
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,998
<i>I'm not gonna hurt you.</i>

336
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:44,949
Jesus Christ!

337
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,190
- Oh, damn.
- Get a med kit.

338
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,315
Nice.

339
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,799
<i>I'm not gonna hurt you.</i>

340
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,757
Duke, get him to the infirmary
with Dr Grimm.

341
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:55,718
Portman, Kid, go to the airlock
and dig in.

342
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:59,750
Anything trying to get away from us
will get driven straight to you.

343
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,870
<i>Now let's see if we can find
the body that goes with that arm.</i>

344
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,112
<i>It's messed up, huh?</i>

345
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,073
Guy like Carmack...

346
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:18,194
<i>who's trained to put logic
before emotion...</i>

347
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,995
<i>he's so freaked, huh...</i>

348
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:23,355
he tears off his own ear?

349
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,828
I tell you, man.

350
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:29,877
<i>It's shit like that
that gets under your skin.</i>

351
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,475
<i>Do you...</i>

352
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:46,316
- Do you have any?
- Do I have any?

353
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,235
What?

354
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,675
You know.

355
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:01,517
<i>I'm just a little shook up. I need
something to get my focus, man.</i>

356
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,670
My game face.

357
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,119
God damn it!

358
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,752
I took His name in vain.

359
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,796
Shit.

360
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,999
There is a God.

361
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:37,954
Ma'am.

362
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,714
Excuse me, ma'am.

363
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,633
Sarge...

364
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,671
I think we found
the rest of that arm.

365
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,636
No, no.

366
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:12,191
<i>- No, no, I don't do nanowalls.
- Yes, you do.</i>

367
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,234
You got him? Wait here.

368
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:21,955
Shit.

369
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,229
Two, three.

370
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,195
You okay?

371
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,111
- Did they find the others?
- Not yet.

372
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,430
My husband is with them.

373
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,392
<i>I'm sure Steve is fine.</i>

374
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,793
<i>Dr Carmack, I'm going to take
your blood pressure.</i>

375
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:01,079
<i>- Hey...
- It's okay, it's okay.</i>

376
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,629
- I can feel it.
- What happened in there?

377
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:08,399
Shut it down. Shut it down.

378
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,914
Shut it down.

379
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:21,475
<i>It's inside.</i>

380
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,954
<i>We heard something in Genetics.
We're re-entering.</i>

381
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:28,429
<i>That's affirmative, Reaper.</i>

382
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,392
Looks like we missed the party.

383
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,118
We were just here.

384
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,551
What happened to all the animals?

385
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:05,429
Sir, RRTS. We're here to help.

386
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,798
Sir, are you okay?

387
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,275
Okay.

388
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,992
No, no, no. Sir, put it down.

389
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,793
<i>Contact report.</i>

390
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:23,915
Damn it.

391
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,436
<i>We found another one
of the scientists.</i>

392
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,476
<i>Some weird shit
going on here, Sarge.</i>

393
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:31,836
- Can you ID him?
- We got a Dr Olsen.

394
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,078
He rushed us. Crazy.
Just like Carmack.

395
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:38,310
<i>- Is he dead?
- Yeah, very.</i>

396
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,709
<i>- Should we bag him and tag him?
- Negative.</i>

397
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,313
Continue your search.

398
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,349
Sarge?

399
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,957
- What was that?
- A monkey.

400
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:48,596
Some kind of monkey.

401
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,639
Oh, my God.

402
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,955
<i>There's something in his blood.</i>

403
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,516
<i>What's happening to him?</i>

404
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,872
- Move, move, move.
- I got him.

405
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,030
- Clear!
- Go, go, go.

406
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,599
<i>- Reaper, what have you got?
- We're chasing something.</i>

407
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,752
- What do you mean "something"?
- Something big, not human.

408
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:43,308
God damn it! Give me a confirmation
on what you see.

409
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,197
<i>- Reaper.
- It's in the sewer.</i>

410
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:49,910
All units, all units.
Southeast corridor near the med lab.

411
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,399
<i>And I thought "being in the shit"
was a figure of speech.</i>

412
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,869
Get in the goddamn hole, Portman.

413
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:06,315
I can handle things here.
You should go.

414
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:10,076
- I want to stay.
- Steve is gonna be okay.

415
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,479
The guys looking for him
are the best.

416
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:18,313
Go on, go on. Be with your daughter.

417
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,669
Thank you.

418
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,114
<i>What's going on?</i>

419
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:34,913
<i>"No blood match."
Can't be good, right?</i>

420
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,072
This is crazy.

421
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,393
Oh, my God!

422
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,236
<i>Tunnel ahead is the main junction.</i>

423
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,191
<i>It leads back under the lab complex.</i>

424
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,635
Destroyer, cover the exit.

425
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,833
We got a Dr Willits.

426
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,554
Steve Willits.

427
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,395
Move out.

428
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,752
<i>"Be sober, be vigilant...</i>

00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,198
<i>That's real comforting, Goat.</i>

432
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:26,350
<i>That ain't freaking me out at all.</i>

433
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,757
- Portman!
- What the fuck?

434
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,709
Go, go.

435
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:36,190
<i>- Wait! Somebody's down there.
- Come on.</i>

436
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,075
Grab an arm.

437
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,390
- Goddamn son of a bitch is heavy!
- Hang on.

438
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,872
<i>Quick, he's slipping back.</i>

439
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,439
<i>He's slipping.</i>

440
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:46,955
Shit.

441
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,033
Portman, what the hell happened?

442
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,758
I fell in the damn hole.

443
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:51,829
Shit.

444
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,275
Everybody, on me.
Watch your goddamn footing.

445
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,395
Move.

446
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,795
Shit.

447
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,358
Goat, straight ahead.

448
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:13,669
Portman, you're with me.

449
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,955
John, take The Kid
and go to the right.

450
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,395
Shit!

451
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,719
You lost your folks, right?

452
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,835
Shut up.

453
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,954
Small world.
I mean, I lost my parents, too.

454
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:00,359
Yeah, I mean, I woke up one morning
and everything was gone.

455
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,919
I mean, the only thing left was me.

456
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,434
They wanted the TV
more than they wanted me.

457
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:11,150
Every time you open your mouth,
you give away our position.

458
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,308
Wait a minute.

459
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:21,230
Your pupils are dilated.

460
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,358
- Are you high?
- What?

461
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,909
<i>- No, I got this condition...
- I don't give a damn.</i>

462
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,275
You take one more shot of that shit
and I'll blow holes in you.

463
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,509
Are we clear?

464
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,755
Okay.

465
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,155
Get down.

466
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,355
<i>I'm sorry, look,
I just needed a little...</i>

467
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,475
Get down!

468
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,433
<i>Goat, I think there's something
coming up on you.</i>

469
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,519
<i>This isn't happening.</i>

470
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,359
My light is down.

471
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,349
<i>I don't see anything.</i>

472
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,715
<i>Don't move. I'm on my way.</i>

473
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,195
Pinky.

<i>Can you see anything?</i>

475
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,108
<i>No. Nothing.</i>

476
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:33,835

<i>Goat, where are you?</i>

481
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,639

483
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:52,275

Everyone, get to the Ark now!

488

Hunegs, report to
the quarantine zone.

489
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:28,438
Evacuate the entire facility.
Get everyone to the Ark now.

Everybody to the Ark.

494
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:41,509
What happened?

495
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:42,919
He was talking about devils.

496
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:43,989
Devils?

497
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:46,640
All his Bible shit.
Angels. Good and evil.

498
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,597
<i>- Devils among us.
- Let's get this vest off him.</i>

499
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:49,954
<i>Now he's clear.</i>

500
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:52,995
Come on.

501
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:56,633
Got a weak pulse.
Portman, get me a line in here.

502
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:58,669
Come on, man.

503
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:00,751
Kid, keep pressure on that wound.

504
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:03,151
<i>- How's the pulse?
- I'm losing him.</i>

505
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:06,396
Sam, give me a shot of adrenaline.

506
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,397
<i>- We lost the pulse.

510
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:27,508
He disappeared.

511

What do you mean, he disappeared?

512
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,598
<i>He's gone. He disappeared.</i>

513
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,638

514
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:33,755
Okay.

515
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:35,558

519
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,353
Come on, you son of a bitch.

520
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:56,032
Okay, going again. Clear!

521
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:19,109
<i>He's gone.</i>

522
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:31,830
Doctor, you are going to tell me
what the fuck is going on up here.

523
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,239
- What?
- Come here.

524
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:36,355
Come here!

525
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:39,314
This is "what."

526
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:42,595
God.

527
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:45,993
Have you found anything like this
on your archaeological digs?

528
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:47,149
No.

529
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:49,959
Is there any way this thing came
from the outside, from the surface?

530
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:51,792
The planet is completely dead.

531
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:53,677
It came from somewhere, lady.

532
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:55,108
Portman, shut up!

533
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,839
<i>The atmosphere on the surface
can't support life.</i>

534
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:58,909
<i>Maybe it doesn't need air.</i>

535
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,592
It could have come from
another planet or something.

536
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:01,715
What? Like an alien?

537
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:03,392
- Look at that thing!
- Portman!

538
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:05,357
You need to shut the fuck up!

539
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,033
<i>That's not what we saw.</i>

540
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:10,633
<i>That's not what Goat and I
shot at in Genetics.</i>

541
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:13,280
<i>You telling me there's more of
these fucking things?</i>

542
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:14,918
Where are your surface entry points?

543
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,753
<i>There's a pressure door at
the end of the north corridor.</i>

544
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:20,559
Destroyer, Kid, Portman, get there
on the double. Give me an update.

545
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:22,392
- Yes, sir.
- Whatever this thing is...

546
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:24,550
it cannot get back through the Ark.

547
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,949
Mac, I want you to arm Pinky
with a weapon...

548
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:29,998
with some ST grenades,
and seal the Ark door.

549
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:31,195
<i>There's one other door.</i>

550
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:32,269
Where?

551
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:35,158
The entrance
to the archaeological dig.

552
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:37,716
<i>Ark portal activation in progress.</i>

553
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:39,910
<i>Don't let anything through the Ark.</i>

554
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:45,558
<i>Hey, wait. Wait a minute.
You can't leave me here.</i>

555
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:47,039
<i>I'm not a soldier.</i>

556
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:48,394
<i>Why don't you go fuck yourself?</i>

557
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:49,515
<i>It's bullshit.</i>

558
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:50,794
You're supposed to protect me.

559
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,233
Ark secure.

560
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:54,959
<i>Remaining personnel,
ready for evacuation.</i>

561
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:04,879
Shit.

562
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:06,555
Duke.

563
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:08,589
Hold this open.

564
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:13,754
<i>Don't be a wuss.</i>

565
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:33,797
Little tension
between you and Reaper?

566
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:36,229
We just went our separate ways.

567
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:39,750
Why does a talented student
throw it all away and join RRTS?

568
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:42,069
So, what was he like before?

569
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:43,798
- Who, John?
- Yeah.

570
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:45,359
Empathetic, sensitive.

571
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:47,556
<i>It's kind of hard for me to imagine
Reaper as sensitive.</i>

572
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:51,428
<i>I knew Reaper before all the "drop
down and give me 50, woo-ha" stuff.</i>

573
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:53,749
Yeah?

574
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:56,472
- Well, it's, "Hoo-ha."
- "Hoo-ha."

575
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:57,834
Yeah.

576
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:00,872
Do you have a family?

577
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:03,954
I have Destroyer.
You know, we grew up together.

578
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:07,879
You know, Duke, I bet
secretly you have a big heart.

579
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:09,154
Oh, yeah?

580
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:13,509
<i>And that's not the only
secret big thing I got.</i>

581
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:15,675
Little rusty, huh?

582
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:18,354
Oh, lady, you have no idea.

583
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:22,156
Right now, having sex with me
is practically your civic duty.

584
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:28,036
I need a power bone saw.

585
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:30,031
A power bone saw?

586
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:32,715
Girl, I've been waiting on you
my whole life.

587
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:35,992
<i>There's one in the procedure room.</i>

588
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:39,078
Down the corridor, on the left,
through the nanowall.

589
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:40,874
Through the nanowall?

590
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:45,640
<i>All right, I got it. It's cool.</i>

591
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:47,915
<i>For you I got it,
'cause you're pretty.</i>

592
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:48,989
Cool.

593
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:50,308
<i>I wouldn't do it for a dude,
you know.</i>

594
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:51,549
Off you go.

595
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,070
We're going back in
through the airlock.

596
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:58,312
We're not calling in backup?

597
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,353
The Ark is sealed.

598
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:04,957
Nothing gets back until
everything on this planet is dead.

599
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:06,839
We're going in hot.

600
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:08,748
You're serious.

601
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:10,713
Pick up your weapon, Portman.

602
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,392
Come on, Portman, move out.

603
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:14,630
<i>Didn't y'all see how that thing
greased Goat?</i>

604
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:17,829
<i>We don't know what
we're dealing with here.</i>

605
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:21,195
<i>It's SOP to call in
reinforcements when a situation...</i>

606
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:22,315
We are...

607
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:24,519
the reinforcements.

608
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:32,873
Now, you shoulder...

609
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:34,951
your fucking weapon, soldier.

610
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,994
<i>All UAC personnel
evacuated to Earth.</i>

611
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:12,795
Duke?

612
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:37,235
Duke?

613
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:40,635
Duke!

614
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:45,520
<i>Hey, hey, hey.
It's just a power shortage.</i>

615
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:46,835
You okay?

616
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:49,839
<i>Here's your bone saw.</i>

617
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,995
- So, which of you is the oldest?
- What?

618
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:55,796
Oh, me. By two minutes.

619
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:57,148
Twins? Shit.

620
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:58,914
Identical, right?

621
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:07,872
Sam, get back in the lab.

622
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:30,995
Shit.

623
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:36,513
Motherfucker!

624
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:38,555
Close it!

625
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:49,950
<i>And that's why I don't do nanowalls.</i>

626
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:53,960
<i>Pinky, we're entering
the archaeological dig.</i>

627
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:05,074
Secure the exit.

628
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:58,912
<i>- Sam.
- I'm coming.</i>

629
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:02,676
<i>I'm hungry. Let's eat.</i>

630
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:13,389
<i>Come on. Come on.</i>

631
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:16,119
<i>Careful now.
Not too close, John.</i>

632
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:19,393
<i>Go, go, go.</i>

633
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:21,588
<i>Slow down.</i>

634
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:23,872
<i>Go around. Go around again.</i>

635
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:26,030
<i>No! Mommy!</i>

636
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:35,512
Is this where it happened?

637
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:39,593
Did you find the door?

638
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:52,395
<i>John?</i>

639
00:52:57,320 --> 00:52:58,355
Clay.

640
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:04,435
Thurman.

641
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:07,674
Look at them.

642
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:11,192
<i>They weren't trying to stop
something from getting in.</i>

643
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:14,355
Something stopped them
from getting out.

644
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:16,989
<i>Mac, stand by.</i>

645
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:19,708
<i>- Destroyer, report.
- We've reached the north airlock.</i>

646
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:20,869
<i>It's secure.</i>

647
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:23,918
<i>Console indicates nothing's
come in or out for 26 hours.</i>

648
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:28,795
Mac?

649
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,035
Mac.

650
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:34,634
Mac, Mac, you copy?

651
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:39,112
Talk to me. Talk to me, Mac.

652
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:42,515
Shit.

653
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:46,073
Jesus Christ.

654
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:55,308
We're in pursuit.
Moving fast out of the dig.

655
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:56,753
<i>It's getting away.</i>

656
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:58,273
Pinky, what do you see?

657
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:00,316
<i>It's big. Very big.</i>

658
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:02,875
Moving fast,
back towards the lab complex.

659
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:06,955
Clear.

660
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:10,159
<i>It's back in the lab.</i>

661
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:15,395
Clear!

662
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:17,389
Clear.

663
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:19,519
<i>Damn, it's fast.</i>

664
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:21,674
All around defence, men.

665
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:22,988
Did you get it?

666
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:25,635
<i>- Pinky.
- Yes, Sarge?</i>

667
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:27,836
Anything gets through that door,
use an ST grenade.

668
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:29,638
<i>It cannot get back to Earth.</i>

669
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:33,470
<i>He pops an ST in there,
he's gonna blow the Ark.</i>

670
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:35,630
Reaper, Kid, pairs, cover formation.

671
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:37,312
Sweep the corridors. Go.

672
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:40,799
Destroyer, you and Portman
stay here. Shut the airlock.

673
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:41,949
Maintain a perimeter.

674
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:44,600
He blows the Ark, how the hell are
we supposed to get the fuck home?

675
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:46,671
Portman, shut the fucking door.

676
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:48,239
Where you going?

677
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:50,033
<i>I'm going to the armoury.</i>

678
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:53,792
I think we're gonna need something
with a little bit more kick.

679
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:23,435
Jesus.

680
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:26,236
You see anything like it before?

681
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:40,829
Heart.

682
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:49,429
Liver.

683
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:01,274
Kidneys.

684
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:03,078
Dogs got kidneys, right?

685
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:04,754
Pigs got kidneys.

686
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:15,117
<i>It's had its appendix removed.</i>

687
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:16,829
<i>It's human.</i>

688
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:19,075
What the fuck?

689
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:02,158
Goat knew he was turning.

690
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:11,636
<i>This thing didn't butcher Willits.</i>

691
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:16,233
It is Willits.

692
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:17,869
What?

693
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:25,958
This is bullshit, man.

694
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:29,029
I enlisted to serve my country,
not get greased protecting some...

695
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:31,350
<i>corporation's goddamn
science project.</i>

696
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:35,953
I gotta take a dump.

697
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:37,832
What? Now?

698
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:41,313
Unless you want me shitting
my pants right here.

699
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,991
<i>Please provide DNA verification.</i>

700
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:55,033
<i>Welcome, Patricia Tallman.
Access granted.</i>

701
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:10,153
Big fucking gun.

702
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:36,708
Shit.

703
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:36,674
Portman, I got floor and wall on
your gun cam.

704
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:39,476
<i>I'm taking a shit, you fucking gimp.</i>

705
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:43,556
<i>Fuck you, Portman,
you piece of shit.</i>

706
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:14,191
Lost Portman on comm and all
I've got on Destroyer is a wall.

707
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:15,679
Portman, come in.

708
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:18,195
Destroyer.

709
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:19,749
Come in.

710
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:43,353
This is Corporal Dean Portman...

711
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:46,910
with RRTS 6 Special Ops
on Olduvai, 0310 hours.

712
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:49,996
We have encountered
hostile activity.

713
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:19,759
I repeat, require immediate
RRTS reinforcements.

714
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:50,551
Destroyer, Portman,
where the hell are you?

715
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:01,068
Shit.

716
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:37,395
Shit.

717
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:50,836
<i>Oh, God! Jesus!</i>

718
01:04:56,800 --> 01:04:58,597
<i>- Pinky, you got Portman?
- No.</i>

719
01:05:16,840 --> 01:05:18,239
Holy shit.

720
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:34,070
<i>He's gone.</i>

721
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:40,789
Destroyer?

722
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:42,155
And Portman.

723
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:43,514
What the fuck happened, man?

724
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:45,033
I got him, I got him.

725
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:49,719
I got you, man.

726
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:51,948
<i>What's up, man?</i>

727
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:01,999
What the hell is this?

728
01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:04,435
And whose goddamn blood
is on that window?

729
01:06:04,520 --> 01:06:05,555
Goat's.

730
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:08,195
He killed himself.

731
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:11,238
What do you mean, he killed himself?
He was already dead.

732
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:12,949
<i>It's true.</i>

733
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:14,075
<i>It's Goat.</i>

734
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:17,710
He was changing into one of these
motherfuckers and he killed himself.

735
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:20,030
We found two more scientists
at the dig.

736
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:21,952
Thurman
and a balding guy with glasses.

737
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:23,268
Dr Clay.

738
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:27,199
Did you check their necks?

739
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:29,077
Were there open wounds
on their necks?

740
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:31,390
We were conducting a firefight,
not an autopsy.

741
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:35,393
We came up here to find six
scientists. Four are known dead...

742
01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:38,917
and Dr Willits is probably KIA
somewhere down in that sewer.

743
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:41,111
The only one missing is Dr Carmack.

744
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:43,191
Has Dr Carmack showed up yet?

745
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,638
<i>Oh, he's shown up all right.</i>

746
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:48,039
Look at the left ear.

747
01:06:56,080 --> 01:06:57,433
Son of a bitch.

748
01:06:57,520 --> 01:06:59,431
I think this other one
is Steve Willits.

749
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:02,193
<i>I'm going to run the DNA,
check it against his med records.</i>

750
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:03,872
What are you people working on
up here?

751
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:06,428
We're analysing bones, artefacts.

752
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:08,158
We're not doing anything like this.

753
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:09,878
Then what the fuck is that?

754
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:14,033
It must be a genetic mutation,
something environmental or viral.

755
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:15,474
<i>I don't know.</i>

756
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:17,952
It may even be reversible.

757
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:19,275
<i>It's irreversible.</i>

758
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:20,679
Not necessarily.

759
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:22,352
<i>Dr Carmack's condition...</i>

760
01:07:23,480 --> 01:07:24,833
is irreversible...

761
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:32,110
<i>because Carmack's condition
is that...</i>

762
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:34,275
<i>he's dead.</i>

763
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:37,237
Kid, you and Duke...

764
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:40,712
get back to the dig and you make
sure those other dead scientists...

765
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:42,119
are really dead.

766
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:49,669
I've lost...

767
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:51,879
four soldiers.

768
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:56,678
What are you people
experimenting with up here?

769
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:01,391
<i>I'm not gonna ask you again.</i>

770
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:05,512
<i>I told you, it's an archaeological
research centre.</i>

771
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:10,071
<i>Do you think I'm lying to you?
Is that what you're saying?</i>

772
01:08:13,240 --> 01:08:15,151
<i>You think I'm hiding something?</i>

773
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:18,918
<i>I'm telling the truth.</i>

774
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:25,718
What were you downloading?

775
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:27,631
What were you sent to protect?

776
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:31,033
The research data.

777
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:34,710
Research into what?

778
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:43,670
<i>Subject was injected with study
agent at 00:03.</i>

779
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:50,390
<i>Vitals normal, elevated heart rate
attributable to subject anxiety.</i>

780
01:08:51,440 --> 01:08:56,036
<i>C- 24 successfully grafted to
subject's marker cells at 00:09.</i>

781
01:08:56,120 --> 01:08:59,192
He reconstructed chromosome mutation
on a human subject.

782
01:09:00,320 --> 01:09:02,436
We were never gonna do
human studies.

783
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:05,156
What the hell are we looking at?

784
01:09:07,360 --> 01:09:09,794
Genesis, Chapter 1.

785
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:14,714
<i>Subject moved to protected
observation area at 00:17.</i>

786
01:09:20,760 --> 01:09:23,274
<i>Subject: Curtis Stahl.</i>

787
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:26,719
<i>Crime: Multiple murder.</i>

788
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:30,793
<i>Status: Condemned to execution.</i>

789
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:42,278
Chromosome 24.

790
01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:45,235
Oh, my God.

791
01:09:45,360 --> 01:09:48,989
<i>49 minutes after injection,
genetic mutations...</i>

792
01:09:49,080 --> 01:09:52,629
<i>began to visually manifest on
subject's extremities.</i>

793
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:04,836
This is what you're here to protect.

794
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:06,673
<i>It doesn't make any sense.</i>

795
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:08,830
You trusted them. They lied to you.

796
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:11,319
They used you, Sam.

797
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:13,796
If he perfected xenogenesis...

798
01:10:13,880 --> 01:10:15,950
<i>Christ, don't you get it?</i>

799
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:18,508
<i>It's this place. It's hell.
It always was.</i>

800
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:23,672
This shit ends here.

801
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:26,719
What are you doing?

802
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:28,472
We need to destroy these discs.

803
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:29,993
<i>That's UAC property.</i>

804
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:32,875
Fuck UAC, we take this back,
they'll just...

805
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:35,116
We take the data back.

806
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:38,513
<i>Sarge, do you not see
what's going on here?</i>

807
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:39,919
<i>I didn't see shit.</i>

808
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:42,397
<i>And I ain't paid to see shit.</i>

809
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:44,631
I have my orders. And so do you.

810
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:48,279
Is this everything?

811
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:51,988
I said, is this everything?

812
01:10:52,360 --> 01:10:55,477
- I have three more to download.
- Then do it.

813
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:09,675
Sarge?

814
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:11,515
We got a problem.

815
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:13,591
<i>One dead scientist is missing.</i>

816
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:15,435
Now.

817
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:19,677
You just wanna leave her here?

818
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,558
<i>She's got a job to do.</i>

819
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:28,553
<i>Look, this is Portman's comm.
You call if you need help, okay?</i>

820
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:32,879
You gonna be all right?

821
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:35,914
I'll be fine.

822
01:11:36,160 --> 01:11:37,912
Okay. I'll see you soon.

823
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:44,158
<i>Pinky, are you there? Pinky.</i>

824
01:11:44,240 --> 01:11:47,676
Sarge? Something is
cutting through the Ark door.

825
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:49,119
You have a visual?

826
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:51,472
<i>Oh, I got a visual all right.</i>

827
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:53,432
<i>Don't let it get to the Ark!</i>

828
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:54,955
<i>Five.</i>

829
01:11:55,040 --> 01:11:56,553
<i>- Pinky, use the grenade!
- Four.</i>

830
01:11:56,680 --> 01:11:58,352
<i>- Use the goddamn grenade!
- Three, two.</i>

831
01:11:58,720 --> 01:12:00,119
<i>- Throw it!
- One.</i>

832
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:18,870
<i>Pinky's gone. That fucker ran.</i>

833
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:19,995
Shit.

834
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:21,388
It got through.

835
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:23,114
What the hell is that?

836
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:24,474
<i>System reboot.</i>

837
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:28,109
<i>Time required to begin
renewed operation: Five minutes.</i>

838
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:29,679
Quarantine cordon is breached.

839
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:31,637
This mission is
no longer containment.

840
01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:33,950
Get all the weapons and ammo
you can. We're going through.

841
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:35,075
Move!

842
01:12:35,160 --> 01:12:36,559
Sam, come in. Over.

843
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:38,710
Sam, do you read me? Over. Come in!

844
01:12:40,040 --> 01:12:41,473
<i>She's not answering.</i>

845
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:43,592
<i>Time required to begin
renewed operation...</i>

846
01:12:43,680 --> 01:12:45,955
<i>four minutes and 45 seconds.</i>

847
01:12:46,240 --> 01:12:47,468
You got three.

848
01:12:53,680 --> 01:12:55,830
Sam! Come in, Sam!

849
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:08,635
Sam!

850
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:10,756
<i>Sam, why didn't you answer your
comm? We gotta go now!</i>

851
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:12,592
Why did they take Goat
and not Destroyer?

852
01:13:12,680 --> 01:13:14,557
Why Carmack and not Dr Thurman?

853
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:16,437
- What?
- Lucy had the 24th chromosome...

854
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:17,555
<i>but she wasn't a monster.</i>

855
01:13:17,640 --> 01:13:20,632
She died protecting her child,
not devouring it.

856
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:23,235
Why did the same chromosome
that made her superhuman...

857
01:13:23,320 --> 01:13:25,117
turn Stahl into a monster?

858
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:27,031
<i>- Let's go.
- Just give me a minute.</i>

859
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:29,839
<i>- We don't have a minute.
- Then give me 10 seconds.</i>

860
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:33,879
This is its tongue.

861
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:36,515
This is brain matter from Portman.

862
01:13:41,680 --> 01:13:43,238
This is from Destroyer.

863
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:52,238
<i>It's choosing, John.</i>

864
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:54,871
<i>It's choosing who to infect.</i>

865
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:57,352
<i>It's choosing? How is it choosing?</i>

866
01:13:57,440 --> 01:14:00,796
There are genetic markers for
psychotic and violent behaviour.

867
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:03,676
It could be a specific
neurotransmitter...

868
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:05,751
<i>it's picking up on, a ganglion.</i>

869
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:08,275
Latching onto numbers
in the DNA code linked to...

870
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:10,954
Linked to what? Evil?

871
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:13,588
Ten percent of the human genome
is still unmapped.

872
01:14:13,680 --> 01:14:16,353
<i>Some say it's
the genetic blueprint for the soul.</i>

873
01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:19,798
Maybe C-24 is what destroyed
the population.

874
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:22,756
It would explain why some of them
had to build the Ark...

875
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:24,637
to escape to a new beginning.

876
01:14:25,240 --> 01:14:28,915
Some it made superhuman.
Others, monsters.

877
01:14:31,160 --> 01:14:32,275
Oh, my God.

878
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:34,438
- We gotta get out of here now.
- What?

879
01:14:34,520 --> 01:14:36,476
<i>Come on, let's go, come on.</i>

880
01:14:36,720 --> 01:14:38,676
The people quarantined on
the other side of the Ark...

881
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:39,988
<i>they won't all be infected!</i>

882
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:41,399
<i>What's going on?</i>

883
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:45,312
Sarge is going to kill them all.
Come on.

884
01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:50,910
We uphold quarantine. Nothing
gets to the elevator back on Earth.

885
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:52,956
<i>We can't let them
get to the surface.</i>

886
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:55,031
<i>- Lf it breathes, kill it.
- Five...</i>

887
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:57,429
<i>four, three...</i>

888
01:14:57,880 --> 01:15:00,235
<i>two, one.</i>

889
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:08,958
<i>Ark travel complete.</i>

890
01:15:09,080 --> 01:15:11,355
UAC ARK FACILITY
PAPOOSE LAKE, NEVADA, USA

891
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:12,998
<i>This is Corporal Dean Portman...</i>

892
01:15:13,080 --> 01:15:16,072
<i>with RRTS 6 Special Ops
on Olduvai, 0310 hours.</i>

893
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:19,236
<i>We have encountered
hostile activity.</i>

894
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:22,957
<i>Require immediate
RRTS reinforcements.</i>

895
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:24,793
Yeah, no shit.

896
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:28,357
We got 58 minutes
before the auto lockdown is lifted.

897
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:30,751
Reset it for another six hours.

898
01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:32,592
<i>I can't. It's been disabled.</i>

899
01:15:32,840 --> 01:15:34,671
Same as the topside comm link.

900
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:36,313
They're disabling computers now?

901
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:38,470
Yeah, they're rocket scientists,
remember?

902
01:16:46,160 --> 01:16:48,151
<i>Ark travel complete.</i>

903
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:49,709
Oh, my God.

904
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:53,273
<i>Sarge, what's your position?</i>

905
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:07,394
Sarge, come in. Do you copy?

906
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:10,275
<i>Come in, Sarge.
Do you read me? Over.</i>

907
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:11,998
<i>Sarge, come in, do you copy?</i>

908
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:13,594
Loud and clear.

909
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:17,117
<i>Look, do not kill everybody.
I repeat, do not kill everybody.</i>

910
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:18,474
<i>They're not all infected.</i>

911
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:20,755
<i>- Help me, help me, please.
- Do you copy?</i>

912
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:23,270
- Copy that.
- Help me.

913
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:33,390
Clear the rest of this sector
and meet back at the Ark chamber.

914
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:57,231
<i>- Jesus Christ, what the hell are...
- Who the hell's in there?</i>

915
01:17:58,080 --> 01:18:01,436
<i>Well, don't just stand there,
you dumb son of a bitch. Help me up.</i>

916
01:18:07,160 --> 01:18:08,195
<i>It's okay.</i>

917
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:19,235
Please...

918
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:21,714
help us.

919
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:26,870
<i>You don't have to kill all of them.</i>

920
01:18:27,080 --> 01:18:31,551
<i>I don't think everyone is infected,
or even capable of being infected.</i>

921
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:36,317
We have orders to contain
this threat by any means necessary.

922
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:38,709
<i>So let's evacuate the uninfected...</i>

923
01:18:39,320 --> 01:18:40,639
and blow this place to hell.

924
01:18:40,720 --> 01:18:42,631
And we have orders
to protect this facility.

925
01:18:42,720 --> 01:18:45,154
<i>We don't have orders
to kill innocent people.</i>

926
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:50,753
We have to stop anything
from getting to the surface...

927
01:18:51,200 --> 01:18:53,509
by any means...

928
01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:55,115
necessary.

929
01:18:56,480 --> 01:18:58,994
Found this little chicken shit
hiding under a pile of dead bodies.

930
01:18:59,080 --> 01:19:00,559
Am I glad to see you guys.

931
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:02,710
That thing
cut right through the door.

932
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:05,712
I tried to use the grenade
but it came at me too fast.

933
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:09,517
Followed me through the Ark
and started to kill everybody.

934
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:11,149
It was horrible.

935
01:19:11,240 --> 01:19:14,471
<i>There's no wound on his neck.
He's clean.</i>

936
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:19,594
<i>I say who's clean...</i>

937
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:23,113
<i>and who's not.</i>

938
01:19:23,400 --> 01:19:25,072
<i>I mean, it wasn't my fault.</i>

939
01:19:27,040 --> 01:19:29,156
<i>Hey, I'm not a soldier.
You shouldn't have left me...</i>

940
01:19:29,240 --> 01:19:30,275
Sarge.

941
01:19:32,920 --> 01:19:34,876
<i>There's a storeroom to the south.</i>

942
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:37,269
<i>It's got, like, 20 people
holed up inside of it.</i>

943
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:38,873
We gotta do something.

944
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,195
Your orders were
to clear that sector.

945
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:44,788
Is it cleared?

946
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:47,112
No, I told them to stay put.

947
01:19:48,040 --> 01:19:50,270
They're okay.
They're just scared shitless.

948
01:19:50,360 --> 01:19:51,679
We kill them all.

949
01:19:55,680 --> 01:19:57,193
Let God sort them out.

950
01:19:58,720 --> 01:19:59,948
This is wrong.

951
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:02,390
<i>- I think...
- Son, you don't think.</i>

952
01:20:05,120 --> 01:20:06,439
<i>That's an order.</i>

953
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:09,672
We're in the field, soldier.

954
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:11,438
<i>Sarge, if nothing's found them...</i>

955
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:15,115
You will obey the direct order...

956
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:18,678
of your commanding officer.

957
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:27,515
No.

958
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:31,435
Now.

959
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:34,555
Go to hell.

960
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:38,395
- No.
- Holy shit.

961
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:52,030
Mutinous insurrection
is punishable...

962
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:54,555
by death.

963
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:01,872
<i>- It was his first mission!
- And it's not gonna be my last.</i>

964
01:21:02,240 --> 01:21:03,593
I need soldiers.

965
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:06,794
<i>I don't need anybody else
but soldiers.</i>

966
01:21:40,680 --> 01:21:42,033
Drop the weapons.

967
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:43,469
I mean it.

968
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:47,355
I have no intention of being killed
by a madman. Drop the weapons.

969
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:55,155
<i>There's something behind me,
isn't there?</i>

970
01:22:07,360 --> 01:22:08,395
On me.

971
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:13,435
Get Sam.

972
01:22:30,280 --> 01:22:31,349
Wait here.

973
01:22:44,120 --> 01:22:45,155
Listen.

974
01:22:53,240 --> 01:22:55,993
Withdraw!
Withdraw behind the nanowall.

975
01:22:56,520 --> 01:22:59,353
<i>- Move!
- I can't see. I can't see.</i>

976
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:12,555
Move.

977
01:23:18,640 --> 01:23:19,868
Clear!

978
01:23:23,960 --> 01:23:25,951
<i>Fuck! The wall's not closing!</i>

979
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:52,837
<i>I'm not supposed to die.</i>

980
01:23:55,160 --> 01:23:56,195
<i>Let's go.</i>

981
01:23:59,680 --> 01:24:01,511
Come on.

982
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:04,555
Clear.

983
01:24:07,760 --> 01:24:09,751
How long before they get through?

984
01:24:11,320 --> 01:24:12,355
Not long.

985
01:24:13,880 --> 01:24:15,359
You've been hit.

986
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:17,068
Oh, John.

987
01:24:31,880 --> 01:24:33,393
Listen to me, Sam.

988
01:24:34,720 --> 01:24:37,439
You're cold. Shivering.

989
01:24:39,160 --> 01:24:40,434
<i>It's important.</i>

990
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:42,837
This is an ST grenade.

991
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:46,238
When they come through...

992
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:49,830
you pop the top and hit the button.

993
01:24:53,560 --> 01:24:55,869
John, stay with me. Stay awake.

994
01:24:56,640 --> 01:24:59,074
John, stay with me, please.

995
01:25:05,160 --> 01:25:06,275
<i>What's that?</i>

996
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:10,197
<i>- It's C-24. It's from Carmack's lab.
- No.</i>

997
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:13,073
- It could save you.
- No way, forget it.

998
01:25:13,640 --> 01:25:15,312
You're bleeding to death.

999
01:25:16,240 --> 01:25:18,435
No way, Sam.

1000
01:25:21,080 --> 01:25:22,718
I've done some bad things.

1001
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:28,274
I know you.

1002
01:25:29,400 --> 01:25:30,719
<i>You don't know me.</i>

1003
01:25:32,760 --> 01:25:34,034
<i>You don't know.</i>

1004
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:37,837
You're my brother. I know you.

1005
01:25:41,960 --> 01:25:42,995
Wait.

1006
01:25:44,760 --> 01:25:45,795
Wait.

1007
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:49,793
If I should turn into
one of those demons.

1008
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:54,630
One through the heart,
one through the head...

1009
01:25:54,720 --> 01:25:56,278
<i>don't you hesitate. Okay?</i>

1010
01:25:56,440 --> 01:25:57,759
<i>I won't need to.</i>

1011
01:26:16,360 --> 01:26:17,873
<i>I know you.</i>

1012
01:26:18,520 --> 01:26:20,397
<i>You're my brother.</i>

1013
01:26:28,160 --> 01:26:29,229
Sam?

1014
01:28:13,560 --> 01:28:14,629
<i>Sam.</i>

1015
01:28:40,360 --> 01:28:41,395
<i>Sam.</i>

1016
01:29:41,720 --> 01:29:43,790
Sam.

1017
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:54,955
<i>John.</i>

1018
01:31:00,320 --> 01:31:01,355
Sam.

1019
01:31:05,800 --> 01:31:06,835
Sam.

1020
01:31:37,040 --> 01:31:40,112
- Sam.
- You're alive.

1021
01:31:41,080 --> 01:31:42,149
<i>Don't talk.</i>

1022
01:31:42,400 --> 01:31:45,039
Last man standing, Reaper.

1023
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:52,916
I think she needs medical attention.

1024
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,753
<i>- Can you get to the elevator?
- I'm not sure.</i>

1025
01:32:02,680 --> 01:32:03,715
Try.

1026
01:32:09,160 --> 01:32:11,276
Where are the survivors Kid found?

1027
01:32:12,720 --> 01:32:14,472
I took care of that problem.

1028
01:32:16,160 --> 01:32:19,914
<i>Quarantine's almost over.
Power should be back on any minute.</i>

1029
01:32:24,600 --> 01:32:29,037
- You killed The Kid.
- We're all killers, Reaper.

1030
01:32:31,280 --> 01:32:33,032
<i>It's what they pay us for.</i>

1031
01:32:33,560 --> 01:32:36,836
<i>Quarantine complete.
Elevators back on line.</i>

1032
01:32:48,080 --> 01:32:49,274
<i>It's finished.</i>

1033
01:32:51,280 --> 01:32:54,352
What do you say we go outside
and get some fresh air?

1034
01:33:02,200 --> 01:33:06,079
- Are you gonna shoot me?
- Yeah, I was thinking about it.

1035
01:33:06,840 --> 01:33:09,752
- What you got left?
- Half a clip. You?

1036
01:33:20,240 --> 01:33:22,117
I've got one round.

1037
01:35:53,160 --> 01:35:55,310
<i>Semper fi, motherfucker.</i>

1038
01:35:57,680 --> 01:36:00,035
Faithful to the Corps, John.

1039
01:38:43,760 --> 01:38:46,069
<i>Ark portal
activation in progress.</i>

1040
01:38:58,480 --> 01:38:59,549
<i>Five...</i>

1041
01:38:59,640 --> 01:39:02,154
<i>four, three...</i>

1042
01:39:02,280 --> 01:39:04,396
<i>two, one.</i>

1043
01:39:17,680 --> 01:39:19,113
Like The Kid said:

1044
01:39:21,280 --> 01:39:22,349
<i>"Go to hell."</i>

1045
01:39:55,440 --> 01:39:56,714
Almost home.
