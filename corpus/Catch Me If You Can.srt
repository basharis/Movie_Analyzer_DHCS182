27
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,512
Our first guest,
he's made a career

28
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,596

the most outrageous impostor

29
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,551

30
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,397

My name is

38

GARAGIOLA:
"From 1964 to 1967

39
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,911
"I successfully impersonated

"and I flew over
two million miles for free.

00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,155
"During that time, I was also
the chief resident pediatrician

"By the time I was caught,
I was considered

"the youngest and most daring

he's going to have
to tell the truth

57
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,030
and we're going to start
our questioning with Kitty.

58
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,640
Thank you. Number One,

a very bright fellow...

why didn't you go in
for a legitimate profession?

61
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,909
It was really a question
of dollars and cents.

62
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,155
When I was a young man,
I needed the money

63
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,952
and I thought
this list of careers

64
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,558

65
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,919

66
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,235
Number Two, I find this all
very fascinating.

67
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,111
Who was it
that finally caught you?

68
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,230

- I opened a checking account

Your son has been pretending

lecturing the students,
uh, giving out homework.

448

Mrs. Glasser has been ill

some confusion
with the real sub.

450
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:48,390
Your son held a teacher-parent
conference yesterday

you fold it

00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,158
You stay away from me...
I don't know who you are

535
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,394
but if you ever
come back here again...

536
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,590
Frankie! Frank, Frank,
calm down, will you?

537
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,755
I'm Dick Kesner.

538
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,870
Now, I want you
to leave your things here

539
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,876
and follow me
into the next room, okay?

540
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,399
They're all waiting for you.

541
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,476
PAULA:
You don't have to be scared.

542
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,397
I'm right here, Frank.
I'll always be here.

543
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,078
But there are laws.

544
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,236
Everything in this country has
to be legal.

545
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:49,113
So what we need to do is
make some decisions.

546
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,718
That's what Mr. Kesner
is here for.

547
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,990
Many times these decisions
are left up to the courts

548
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,439
but that can be
very expensive, Frank

549
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,038
people fighting
over their children.

550
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,638
Nobody is fighting.

551
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:00,240
Look at me, Frank.
Nobody is fighting.

552
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,475
<i>(speaking French)</i>

553
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,715
<i>(quietly)</i>:
Dad, what's going on?

554
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,193
Dad, what's going on?

555
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,708
<i>(speaking French continues)</i>

556
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,273
Do you remember your grandma,
Eve?

557
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,958
She arrived this morning.

558
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,353
<i>(speaks French)</i>

559
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,833
Hello.

560
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,912
Do you understand what
we're saying to you, Frank?

561
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:31,268
Your father and I
are getting a divorce.

562
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,709
<i>(speaking French)</i>

563
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,875
Nothing's gonna change.

564
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,558
We're still gonna see
each other.

565
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,431
Stop it, please, Frank.
Don't interrupt.

566
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,675
Frank, you don't
have to read all of this.

567
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,712
Most of it's for your parents...
boring adult business...

568
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,399
but this paragraph right here,
this is important

569
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:49,000
because it states
who you're gonna live with...

570
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,917
after the divorce...

571
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,791
whose custody you will be in.

572
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:55,832
And there's a blank space
right here.

573
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:56,790
<i>(Eve speaking French)</i>

574
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,193
And I want you to go
into the kitchen

575
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,753
sit at the table

576
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,358
and put a name down.

577
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,674
You can take
as long as you want

578
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,278
but when you come back
into this room...

579
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,788
<i>I want to see a name</i>
<i>on that line. </i>

580
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:10,389
Frank, just write down a name
and this will all be over.

581
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,271
It's gonna be okay.

582
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,992
FRANK:
<i>Dad, what name? </i>

583
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,109
Your mother or your father.

584
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,196
Just put the name there.
It's as simple as that.

585
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:20,118
And don't look so scared.

586
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,832
It's not a test.

587
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,791
<i>There's no wrong answer. </i>

588
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,998
<i>(man announcing trains</i>
<i>indistinctly)</i>

589

<i>(melancholy jazz playing)</i>

590
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,030
Hi.

<i>(panting)</i>

592
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,593
One ticket to Grand Central,

That'll be $3.50, sir.

594
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,519
Is it okay
if I write you a check?

595
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:53,033
Carl, when do I get
to call my father?

596
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:55,514
You can call him
when we get to New York.

597
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,312
We leave for the airport
in seven hours.

598
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,679
Paris, France 1969

599
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,870
Until then, just sit there.

600
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:03,514
Be quiet.

601
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,790
You know, Carl,
on the other side of the hotel

602
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,592
they got suites
that face the park.

603
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:11,672
It's the best room
the FBI can afford.

604
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,911
It's okay, I've stayed in worse.

605

<i>Mr. Mudrick... </i>

606
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,508
Mr. Mudrick, please.
You have to listen.

607
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,232
I don't want to hear your story.

608
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,952
This is two checks that bounced.

609
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,672
You know how much trouble
I'm in?

610
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:26,473
No, but listen, I'm telling you,
the bank, they made the mistake.

611
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,953
I'll write you another check
right now!

612
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,831
What, do I look like
I was born yesterday?

613
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,632
Look, it's midnight,
Mr. Mudrick.

614
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,590
Where am I gonna go?

615
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,153
You're a goddamn kid.

616
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,111

My boss sent me to Brooklyn,
then Queens.

622
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,153
Now he wants me in Long Island

623
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,555
to take a few clients out
for a night on the town.

624
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,990
I'm sorry, but we're not allowed
to cash checks from other banks.

625
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,156
How would we know
if they were any good?

626
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,838
What did you say your name was?

627
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:36,949
Ashley.

628
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,992
Ashley... you know what I found
on the sidewalk out there?

629
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,310
Must've slipped
right off your neck.

630
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:55,110
Is there something

<i>Love, your son, Frank. </i>

659
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,272
Hello.

660
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,515
I'm Frank Black
from Murrow High School

661
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:39,028
and I have an appointment
with Mr. Morgan.

662
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,274
You're the young man

663
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,117
who's writing the article
for the school paper.

664
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,593
Yes, ma'am, that's me.
I want to know

665
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,517
everything there is to know
about being a pilot.

666
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,073
What airports
does Pan Am fly to?

667
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,758
What does a pilot make
in a year?

668
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:51,030
And who tells them
where they're gonna fly to?

669
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,195
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down.

670
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,355
Just take 'em one at a time.

671
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,515
All right. What does it mean

672
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,073
when one pilot says
to another pilot:

673
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,519
"What kind of equipment
are you on?"

674
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,949
They just want to know what kind
of aircraft you're flying:

675
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,319
Is it a DC-8, 707,
Constellation?

676
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,920
And what about those I.D. badges
that I've seen pilots wear?

677
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,030
Well, every pilot has to have
two things with him

678
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,116
at all times: One is
his airline personnel badge...

679
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,037
Iooks just like this one here,
from Pan Am...

680
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,594
the other one is
their FAA license...

681
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,870
and that looks just like this.

682
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:18,469
Oh. Sir, do you think I can
make a copy of this

683
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,238
to put into my article?

684
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,998
Oh, Frank,
you can have that one.

685
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,314
It's three years expired.

686
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,873
Aw, thanks!
And what about your I.D. badge?

687
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,319
You have an extra one
I could borrow?

688
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:28,237
Oh, no, I can't help you there.

689
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,111
Those are special-ordered
from Polaroid.

690
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,593
The only way
to get one of those

691
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:34,108
is to become a real live pilot
for Pan American Airways.

883
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:48,076
They're called routing numbers.

884
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:50,236
So where do the checks
get routed to?

885
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,430
You know, I don't exactly know.

886
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,959

asked me that before.

Our next item up for bid

889

is also from the Jersey
Central Bank foreclosure.

890
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,595
This is a MICR encoder

891
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:03,232
a machine used
to encode bank checks.

892
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,474
Do I have an opening bid?

HANRATTY:
<i>Our unknown subject</i>
<i>is a paperhanger</i>

894
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,118

<i>on the East Coast. </i>

895
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,196
<i>In the last few weeks, </i>

896
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,629
<i>a new form of check fraud</i>
<i>which I'm calling "the float. "</i>

897
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:13,715
What he's doing is

898
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,716
he's opening checking accounts
at various banks

899
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,478
then changing the MICR ink
routing numbers

900
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,794

Uh, the remote thing is broken.

905
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,435
You'll have to do it by hand.

You've gotta... try the...

00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:28,915
Agent Mullen, it should be...

909
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,030
it should be the square button
just there by the side.

910
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,195
This carousel doesn't work.

911
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,593
It's a bad carousel
you got there.

912
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:34,629
Thank you, Agent Mullen.

913
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:35,829
Got to move it manually.

00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:38,235
This is a map of the 12 banks
of the U.S. Federal Reserve.

917
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,679

slide...

920
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:49,431
and then, ship that check off
to its corresponding branch.

921
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:52,074
Carl, for those of us who are
unfamiliar with bank fraud

922
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:54,315
you mind telling us
what the hell

923
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,713
you're talking about?

924
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:59,514
The East Coast branches are
numbered zero-one to zero-six.

925
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:01,516
The central branch
is zero-seven, zero-eight

926
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:02,595
so on, so forth.

927
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,153
You mean those numbers
on the bottom of a check

928
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,235
actually mean something?

929
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,589
All of this was in the report
I filed two days ago.

930
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:11,599
If you change...
a zero-two to a one-two

931
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:14,359
that means that check,
which was cashed in New York

932
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,958
does not go
to the New York Federal Branch

933
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,149
but it is rerouted

934
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:20,317
all the way to the San Francisco
Federal Branch.

935
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:23,079
The bank doesn't even know the
check has bounced for two weeks

936
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,997
which means our unsub can stay
in one place

937
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,598
paper the same city
over and over again

938
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,119
while his checks circle
the country.

939
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:31,357
You know,
you want to talk to my wife.

940
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,914
She's the one balances
the checkbook at our house.

It's all about timing, Frank.

991

The goddamn government
knows that.

992

They hit you when you're down.

993
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:50,873
I wasn't going to let them
take it from me, so I just...

994
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:53,718
shut the doors myself,
called their bluff.

995
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:00,316

If you were having

00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:42,549
Were you... punished
for screwing up in the field?

1058
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:45,068
Oh, no, no, no, I've never
worked in the field before.

1059
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:46,712
I audited
background investigations

1060
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:48,796

clerical applicants.

1061
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:50,068
Well, that's just great.

1062
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:51,348

1063
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:53,356

of the Pacific.

1064
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:55,834
You mind if I ask you
a question, Agent Hanratty?

1065
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:57,916
How come you're so serious
all the time?

1066
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:00,155
Does it bother you,
Mr. Amdursky?

1067

Yeah. Yeah, it does bother me.

1068

1069
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:06,599
A little, I guess.

1070
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:10,235

to hear me tell a joke?

Yeah. Yeah, we'd love
to hear a joke from you.

So, my-my next question is,
when a pilot retires

1236
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:41,596
uh, Pan Am sends them
a check every single month?

1237

feel sorry for me.

1402
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:28,838
The truth is,
I knew it was you.

1403
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:31,758
Now maybe I didn't get the cuffs
on you, but I knew.

1404
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:35,793
Ah, people only know
what you tell them, Carl.

1405
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:39,276
Well, then tell me this,
Barry Allen, Secret Service.

1406
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:42,392
How did you know
I wouldn't look in your wallet?

1407
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:44,954
The same reason
the Yankees always win.

1408
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,992
Nobody can keep their eyes
off the pinstripes.

1409
01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:51,157
The Yankees win
because they have Mickey Mantle.

1410
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:53,270
No one ever bets on the uniform.

I'll tell you what I <i>am</i> sure of.

1414
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:00,317
You're going to get caught.

1415
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:03,318
One way or another,
it's a mathematical fact.

1416
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:04,793
It's-It's like Vegas.

1417
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:06,068
The House always wins.

1418
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:15,149
Well, Carl, I'm sorry,
but I have to go.

1419
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:18,033

Wait, kid, kid, kid.

You mean like the comic book?

01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:31,395
Yeah, the comic book.

When he's not The Flash.

1451
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:34,033
That's his name, Barry Allen.

1452
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:36,469
Thank you.

1453
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:42,994
Now get this:
He reads comic books.

Barry Allen is The Flash!

He's a kid.
Our unsub is a kid.

1458

That's why we couldn't match
his prints.

1459
01:04:51,880 --> 01:04:53,472

a record.

He's been kiting checks

on a closed account
at Chase Manhattan Bank?

Oh, yes.

1492
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:07,354
The police think
he's some type of criminal.

1493
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:09,994
What he did was a felony,
Mrs. Barnes.

1494
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:11,712
It was $1,000.

1495

I'm so sorry, Frank.

1754

I can't do this.

Brenda, listen to me.

I don't care if you're
a virgin, all right?

1757

Really, I can wait.

1758

I'm not a virgin.

1759
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:16,320
I had an abortion two years ago.

1760
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:22,798
My parents had a friend do it

1761
01:17:22,840 --> 01:17:26,913
a man that my father
plays golf with.

1762
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:31,033
And then, when I got better,
they kicked me out of the house.

1763
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:33,799
I had an abortion and I wasn't
their daughter anymore.

01:17:44,520 --> 01:17:47,637
what if I spoke
to your parents, right?

1772
01:17:47,680 --> 01:17:49,511
May-Maybe I can
straighten things out, huh?

1773
01:17:49,560 --> 01:17:51,471
Well, I ask them all the time

1774
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:54,034

can't come home.

that he eventually churned
that cream into butter

1801
01:19:51,240 --> 01:19:53,117

Frank, have you decided
which hospital

01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:12,552
you want to work at
here in New Orleans?

1811
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:14,670
Well, um, to be quite honest

1812
01:20:14,720 --> 01:20:17,792
I'm thinking
about getting back into law.

1813

Oh, my!

1814
01:20:19,560 --> 01:20:21,676
Are you a doctor or a lawyer?

1815
01:20:21,720 --> 01:20:25,838
Before I went to medical school,
I passed the bar in California.

1816
01:20:25,880 --> 01:20:27,711
I practiced law for one year

1817
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:30,957

try my hand at pediatrics?

The truth is, sir, that...

1860
01:22:49,720 --> 01:22:51,199
The truth is that...

1861
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:56,710
I'm not a doctor,
I'm not a lawyer...

1862

Men like us are nothing

01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:36,792
I must confess, I'm guilty
of the same foolish whimsy.

1870
01:23:36,840 --> 01:23:38,910
I proposed to Carol

What are we looking for?

2087

Engagement announcements,
name of Conners.

2088
01:34:10,200 --> 01:34:12,430
Conners?! Come on, Carl,
the kid would've

2089
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:13,913
changed his name by now.

2090
01:34:13,960 --> 01:34:16,599
Mm-mm. He can't change it.

2091

She thinks he's Conners.

2092
01:34:18,480 --> 01:34:20,596
If he loses the name,
he loses the girl.

Not at all.
What can I do for you?

2131
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:47,797
Brenda, you love me, right?

2132

Yes.

I mean, you'd love me

2134
01:35:50,880 --> 01:35:51,790
Yes.

Brenda, listen. A name, right?

2140
01:35:58,320 --> 01:35:59,514
A name, it doesn't matter.

2141
01:35:59,560 --> 01:36:01,073
My name is Frank Conners, right?

2142
01:36:01,120 --> 01:36:02,314
- That's who I am with you.
- Yes.

You know,
sometimes when I travel

2145
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,195
I use the name Frank Taylor.
That-That's my secret.

2146
01:36:07,240 --> 01:36:09,117
- Frank Taylor?!
- Yeah, Frank Taylor, you know?

2147
01:36:09,160 --> 01:36:10,309
- Frank Black.
- Frank Black?!

2148

Yeah, it doesn't matter.

Why are you saying all this?

2150
01:36:14,120 --> 01:36:16,714
Brenda... Brenda, I don't want
to lie to you anymore.

2151
01:36:16,760 --> 01:36:18,159
All right? I'm not a doctor.

2152
01:36:18,200 --> 01:36:19,872
I never went to medical school.

2153
01:36:19,920 --> 01:36:22,514
I'm not a lawyer or a Harvard
graduate or a Lutheran.

2154
01:36:22,560 --> 01:36:24,994
Brenda, I ran away from home
a year and a half ago

2155
01:36:25,040 --> 01:36:26,792
when I was 16.

2156

Frank...

Frank?

2158
01:36:31,720 --> 01:36:33,597
You're not a Lutheran?

2159

Brenda... you see
all this money?

01:36:36,040 --> 01:36:37,951
You see all this money?
I have more.

I have plenty more.

2162
01:36:40,520 --> 01:36:41,475
I have enough money

2163
01:36:41,520 --> 01:36:43,317

2254
01:41:28,320 --> 01:41:29,753
Because I'm not in New York.

2255
01:41:29,800 --> 01:41:30,994
I'm not in Atlanta.

2256
01:41:31,040 --> 01:41:32,837
Yes, this is, uh, Frank Roberts

2257
01:41:32,880 --> 01:41:34,836
and I'm letting
all the universities

2258
01:41:34,880 --> 01:41:37,599
in the area know
that Pan Am will be initiating

2259
01:41:37,640 --> 01:41:39,596
a new recruiting program
this year.

2260
01:41:39,640 --> 01:41:42,757
I'Il, uh, be stopping
by your campus tomorrow morning.

2261
01:41:42,800 --> 01:41:45,712
Thank you all very much
for coming.

2262
01:41:45,760 --> 01:41:46,875
At the end of the day

2263
01:41:46,920 --> 01:41:49,912
I'll be choosing eight
young ladies to be a part of...

2264
01:41:49,960 --> 01:41:51,473
<i>(cheering and laughter)</i>

2265
01:41:51,520 --> 01:41:54,193
...Pan Am's future stewardess
flight crew program.

2266
01:41:54,240 --> 01:41:56,708
Now, these eight young ladies
will accompany me

2267
01:41:56,760 --> 01:41:59,672

tour through Europe.

2268

01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,560

what it takes

2270
01:42:03,600 --> 01:42:05,591
to be a Pan American stewardess.

01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:12,388
Nah, one man

2274
01:42:12,440 --> 01:42:13,714

01:42:15,240 --> 01:42:17,117
Yeah?

2277
01:42:17,160 --> 01:42:19,196
Make sure your uniforms

You, here.

2281
01:42:26,880 --> 01:42:30,509
What qualifies me
to be a future stewardess?

2282
01:42:30,560 --> 01:42:32,994
Well, I think
that I'm really friendly

2283
01:42:33,040 --> 01:42:34,678

2284
01:42:34,720 --> 01:42:38,235

Carl, your walkie-talkie

01:44:21,720 --> 01:44:23,073
There's a guy
in a Pan Am uniform

2320
01:44:23,120 --> 01:44:25,680
sitting in a white Coupe DeVille
out in front of Terminal J.

01:44:28,080 --> 01:44:29,195
He's got his pilot's cap on.

Step out of the car!

Keep your hands

Don't shoot me!
I'm just a driver.

2337
01:44:52,360 --> 01:44:54,351
A man paid me $100
to wear this uniform

2338
01:44:54,400 --> 01:44:55,469
and pick someone up
at the airport.

2339

Singapore, Egypt.

Why wasn't I called?

01:45:27,160 --> 01:45:28,559
FOX:
Nobody was called, sir.

2349
01:45:28,600 --> 01:45:31,478
The banks didn't know what
was happening till last week.

2350
01:45:31,520 --> 01:45:32,635
That's impossible.

2351
01:45:32,680 --> 01:45:34,352
They didn't call
'cause it's not counterfeiting.

2352
01:45:34,400 --> 01:45:35,913
- It's something else.
- Well, what is he doing?

2353
01:45:35,960 --> 01:45:37,029
He's making real checks, sir.

2354
01:45:37,080 --> 01:45:37,990
These are so perfect

2355
01:45:38,040 --> 01:45:39,553
the airline didn't know
the difference.

2356
01:45:39,600 --> 01:45:41,272
Last check was cashed
in Madrid a week ago.

2357
01:45:41,320 --> 01:45:42,435
My guess is he's still there.

2358
01:45:42,480 --> 01:45:43,754
We have to leave now, sir.
Today.

2359
01:45:43,800 --> 01:45:45,028
Go where?

2360
01:45:45,080 --> 01:45:46,638
Spain? You want to go to Spain?

2361
01:45:46,680 --> 01:45:47,999
Well, eventually,
he's got to go back

2362
01:45:48,040 --> 01:45:49,189
to where the checks
were printed.

2363
01:45:49,240 --> 01:45:51,117
I think that's why
he's moving back through Europe.

2364
01:45:51,160 --> 01:45:52,752
Look at the map, sir.
He's making a circle.

2365
01:45:52,800 --> 01:45:53,789
He's running out of checks.

2366
01:45:53,840 --> 01:45:55,193
I know it's a...
it's a long shot, sir

2367
01:45:55,240 --> 01:45:57,595
but if we track him from Madrid,
sir, we could still catch him.

2368
01:45:57,640 --> 01:45:59,358
I'm sorry, Carl,
if you couldn't catch him here

2369
01:45:59,400 --> 01:46:00,719
you're not going
to catch him there.

2370
01:46:00,760 --> 01:46:02,557
But, sir, we're going
to let him get away.

2371
01:46:02,600 --> 01:46:06,036
No, Carl, you let him get away.

Oh, yeah,

talking on Christmas, Carl?

2423
01:48:47,720 --> 01:48:49,472
Every Christmas
I'm talking to you!

Put your shirt on, Frank.
You're under arrest.

2426
01:48:52,480 --> 01:48:54,391
Hey, are you hungry?
Do you want some beans, Carl?

2427
01:48:54,440 --> 01:48:55,793
They got the best
French beans here.

2428
01:48:55,840 --> 01:48:56,750
Here, give these a try.

2429
01:48:56,800 --> 01:48:58,631
There's two dozen French
police officers outside.

2430
01:48:58,680 --> 01:49:00,238
Carl, I gotta tell you,
they're delicious.

2431
01:49:00,280 --> 01:49:01,349
They wanted to bring you in.

2432
01:49:01,400 --> 01:49:02,515
You want a bite?

2433
01:49:02,560 --> 01:49:03,993
But they needed the help
of an American.

2434
01:49:04,040 --> 01:49:05,189
Are you hungry?
You want a bite?

2435
01:49:05,240 --> 01:49:06,798
But I told them
I wouldn't bring them to you

2436
01:49:06,840 --> 01:49:08,432
unless I could put the cuffs
on you myself.

2437
01:49:08,480 --> 01:49:09,993
Well, you have a gun?
You have a gun?

2438

- No gun?
- No.

2439
01:49:11,160 --> 01:49:12,149
No gun.

2440
01:49:13,760 --> 01:49:15,352

Well, there's no windows here.

01:49:25,160 --> 01:49:27,594
I'm going to take a look
out the front door.

No! No!

2450
01:49:28,760 --> 01:49:31,354
I told them I'd walk out first
and give a signal.

Here, you can
put these on yourself.

No, I can't do that!
I can't do that.

You're wearing
a wedding ring, Carl!

You lied to me about that!

2468

Didn't you lie about that?!

2469
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:02,592
You asked me if I had a family.

2470
01:50:02,640 --> 01:50:04,119
I did, but I don't anymore.

What, did you...
you pay some hotel desk clerk

2479
01:50:21,440 --> 01:50:23,476
to make that call for you,
is that what you did?

2480
01:50:23,520 --> 01:50:24,430
It was Captain Luc.

2481
01:50:24,480 --> 01:50:25,595
I've got one minute
to bring you out.

These people

They're angry.

you steal their money

you live in their country.

what was going to happen

that there was no other way
for it to end.

How are you?

2770
02:04:50,680 --> 02:04:52,591
I have a half a dozen

How'd you pass the bar

Listen...

02:05:43,800 --> 02:05:45,791
I'm sorry I put you

You go back to Europe, you're

we'll send you

I know that.

2787
02:05:55,600 --> 02:05:57,955
I spent four years trying
to arrange your release.

2788
02:05:58,000 --> 02:05:59,672
Had to convince my bosses
at the FBI

2789
02:05:59,720 --> 02:06:01,915
and the Attorney General
of the United States

2790
02:06:01,960 --> 02:06:02,870
you wouldn't run.

2791
02:06:02,920 --> 02:06:05,673
Why'd you do it?

2792
02:06:05,720 --> 02:06:07,073
You're just a kid.

2793
02:06:07,120 --> 02:06:08,838
I'm not your kid.

2794
02:06:08,880 --> 02:06:11,155
You said you were
going to Chicago.

2795
02:06:11,200 --> 02:06:13,031
My daughter can't see me
this weekend.

2796
02:06:13,080 --> 02:06:14,957
She's going skiing.

2797
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:16,558
You said she was four years old.

2798
02:06:16,600 --> 02:06:17,635
You're lying.

2799
02:06:17,680 --> 02:06:19,193
She was four when I left.

2800
02:06:19,240 --> 02:06:20,559
Now she's 15.

2801
02:06:20,600 --> 02:06:23,637
My wife's been remarried
for 11 years.

2802
02:06:23,680 --> 02:06:25,830
I see Grace every now and again.

2803
02:06:25,880 --> 02:06:27,757
I don't understand.

2804
02:06:27,800 --> 02:06:29,677
Sure you do.

2805
02:06:29,720 --> 02:06:32,280
Sometimes it's easier
living the lie.

2806
02:06:35,600 --> 02:06:38,433
I'm going to let you
fly tonight, Frank.

2807
02:06:38,480 --> 02:06:40,277
I'm not even going
to try to stop you.

2808
02:06:40,320 --> 02:06:42,550
That's 'cause I know
you'll be back on Monday.

2809
02:06:42,600 --> 02:06:45,751
Yeah? How do you know
I'll come back?

HANRATTY:
<i>Good morning. </i>

2821
02:07:30,280 --> 02:07:32,236
I've, uh, called this meeting
to discuss

2822
02:07:32,280 --> 02:07:34,475
a new type of check fraud
and counterfeiting

2823
02:07:34,520 --> 02:07:36,829
which the unsub is washing
and altering checks

2824
02:07:36,880 --> 02:07:38,757
then passing them
throughout Arizona.

passing checks
as large as five figures.

Sorry.

2831
02:07:57,920 --> 02:08:01,196
We have a recovered check
on Agent Reiter's desk.

2832
02:08:01,240 --> 02:08:03,151
Why don't we step out
to the bullpen?

2833
02:08:07,320 --> 02:08:11,074
There's impressions
on every line.

2834
02:08:11,120 --> 02:08:14,715
Looks like the original amount
was for $60.

2835
02:08:18,280 --> 02:08:19,474
Mind if I take a look?

2836
02:08:22,840 --> 02:08:25,718
Cashed in Flagstaff a week ago.

2837
02:08:27,480 --> 02:08:30,278
Cost the bank $16,000.

2838
02:08:30,320 --> 02:08:32,197
It's a real check.

2839
02:08:32,240 --> 02:08:34,151
Yeah.

2840
02:08:34,200 --> 02:08:35,349
Yeah. It's been washed.

2841
02:08:35,400 --> 02:08:37,277
The only thing original
is the signature.

2842
02:08:37,320 --> 02:08:39,072
But it's perfect, Carl.
I mean...

2843
02:08:39,120 --> 02:08:41,315
I mean, this isn't hydrochloride
or bleach.

2844
02:08:41,360 --> 02:08:43,555
No.

2845
02:08:43,600 --> 02:08:45,238
Something new.

2846
02:08:45,280 --> 02:08:47,236
Maybe a nail polish remover
where the acetone

2847
02:08:47,280 --> 02:08:49,157
removes the ink
that's not been printed?

2848
02:08:53,040 --> 02:08:55,873
How did you do it, Frank?

2849
02:08:55,920 --> 02:08:58,798
How did you cheat
on the bar exam in Louisiana?

2850
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:07,072
I didn't cheat.

2851
02:09:07,120 --> 02:09:10,590
I studied for two weeks
and I passed.

2852
02:09:11,640 --> 02:09:13,835
Is that the truth, Frank?

2853
02:09:13,880 --> 02:09:16,030
Is that the truth?

2854
02:09:16,080 --> 02:09:18,469
I'll bet this guy steals checks
out of mailboxes.

2855
02:09:18,520 --> 02:09:20,954
He washes off their names
and he puts on his own.

2856
02:09:22,720 --> 02:09:24,870
You're saying that he's a local?

2857
02:09:24,920 --> 02:09:26,148
Well, if it were me, you know

2858
02:09:26,200 --> 02:09:28,395
I'd call the bank first,
I'd check out the balance...

2859
02:09:28,440 --> 02:09:29,998
Make sure there's enough money
in there

2860
02:09:30,040 --> 02:09:31,189
to make it worth your while.

2861
02:09:31,240 --> 02:09:32,309
Exactly.

2862
02:09:32,360 --> 02:09:34,271
You know, Carl, I think
this guy's pretty smart.

2863
02:09:34,320 --> 02:09:35,878
I guess all we have to do now
is catch him.

2864
02:09:35,920 --> 02:09:37,353
We'll start first thing
in the morning.

2865
02:09:37,400 --> 02:09:38,833
We'll run the name
Eric Anthony Feeders.

2866
02:09:38,880 --> 02:09:40,029
In Nevada, Arizona, California.

2867
02:09:40,080 --> 02:09:44,073
Frank Abagnale, Jr. Has been
married for 26 years. He has
three sons and lives a quiet
life in the midwest.

2868
02:09:44,120 --> 02:09:52,232
Since his release from prison in
1974, Frank has helped the FBI
capture some of the world's most
elusive check forgers

2869
02:09:52,280 --> 02:09:59,436
and counterfeiters, and is
considered one of the world's
foremost authorities on bank
fraud and forgery.

2870
02:09:59,480 --> 02:10:07,956
Frank has also designed many of
the secure checks that banks and
Fortune 500 companies use every
day.

2871
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:12,312
For his services, these
companies pay Frank Abagnale,
Jr. Millions of dollars a year.

2872
02:10:13,400 --> 02:10:18,315
Frank and Carl remain close
friends to this day.
