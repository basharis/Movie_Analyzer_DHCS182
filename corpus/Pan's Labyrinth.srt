1
00:00:42,142 --> 00:00:48,513
<i>Spain, 1944</i>

2
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:51,084
<i>The Civil War is over.</i>

3
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:53,219
<i>Hidden in the mountains,</i>

4
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:55,422
<i>armed men are still fighting</i>
<i>the new Fascist regime.</i>

5
00:00:55,422 --> 00:00:57,686
<i>Military posts are established</i>
<i>to exterminate the Resistance.</i>

6
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:24,580
A long time ago,

7
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:31,621
in the Underground Realm,
where there are no lies or pain,

8
00:01:32,692 --> 00:01:36,685
there lived a princess who dreamt
of the human world.

9
00:01:38,698 --> 00:01:43,897
She dreamt of blue skies,
soft breeze and sunshine.

10
00:01:49,008 --> 00:01:50,202
One day,

11
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:54,573
eluding her keepers,
the princess escaped.

12
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:02,478
Once outside...

13
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:06,585
the bright sun blinded her
and erased her memory.

14
00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:12,726
She forgot who she was
and where she came from.

15
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:19,434
Her body suffered cold, sickness and pain.
And eventually she died.

16
00:02:20,773 --> 00:02:23,003
However, her father, the king,

17
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:26,335
always knew that the Princess' soul
would return,

18
00:02:26,846 --> 00:02:28,313
perhaps in another body,

19
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:31,507
in another place, at another time.

20
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:35,445
He would wait for her,
until he drew his last breath,

21
00:02:35,788 --> 00:02:39,087
until the world stopped turning.

22
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:50,458
Why did you bring
so many books, Ofelia?

23
00:02:50,637 --> 00:02:53,231
We're going to the country,
the outdoors.

24
00:02:58,745 --> 00:03:00,406
Fairy tales?

25
00:03:00,813 --> 00:03:04,909
You're a bit too old to be filling your head
with such nonsense.

26
00:03:07,987 --> 00:03:09,887
Ask him to stop the car.

27
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,870
Ofelia, wait.

28
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:29,166
Your brother's not well.

29
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:33,937
Madam, are you okay?

30
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,747
Ofelia?

31
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:47,051
Ofelia, Come here.

32
00:04:50,256 --> 00:04:53,487
-l saw a fairy.
-Just look at your shoes!

33
00:04:54,727 --> 00:04:55,716
Let's go.

34
00:04:56,863 --> 00:04:59,764
When we get to the mill,
come out to greet the Captain.

35
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:01,830
l want you to call him Father.

36
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:04,702
You have no idea
how good he's been to us.

37
00:05:06,105 --> 00:05:09,404
lt's just a word, Ofelia...
just a word...

38
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,064
They're coming, Captain.

39
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:39,561
15 minutes late.

40
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:58,683
Carmen.

41
00:06:06,165 --> 00:06:07,462
Welcome.

42
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:14,705
That's not necessary.
l can walk perfectly well.

43
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:17,642
Doctor Ferreiro prefers
that you don't exert yourself.

44
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:19,208
No.

45
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,249
Come.
Do it for me.

46
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:30,513
Thank you.

47
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:33,551
Ofelia, come out.

48
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,654
Say hello to the Captain.

49
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:41,757
Ofelia.

50
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:52,104
lt's the other hand, Ofelia.

51
00:06:56,048 --> 00:06:57,072
Mercedes!

52
00:06:58,351 --> 00:07:01,184
-Bring the luggage.
-Sir.

53
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:08,444
lt's a labyrinth.

54
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:14,516
Just a pile of old rocks
that have always been here.

55
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:16,819
Even before the mill.

56
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:20,831
Better not to go in there.
You may get lost.

57
00:08:21,467 --> 00:08:22,661
Thank you.

58
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:24,533
Have you read them all?

59
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:25,969
Mercedes!

60
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:29,063
The Captain is calling.

61
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:32,737
Your father needs me.

62
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:36,807
He's not my father.

63
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:39,242
The Captain is not my father.

64
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:42,751
My father was a tailor.
He died in the war.

65
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:44,220
He's not my father.

66
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:48,059
You've made that clear enough.
Shall we go?

67
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,556
Have you seen my mother?

68
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,622
-lsn't she beautiful!
-Yes.

69
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:55,431
She's sick with baby.
Did you notice?

70
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:15,083
The guerrillas are sticking
to the woods

71
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,185
because it's hard
to track them up there.

72
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,655
Those bastards know the terrain
better than any of us.

73
00:09:20,826 --> 00:09:22,487
We'll block all access
to the woods

74
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:26,923
Food, medicine-
we'll store it all. Right here.

75
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:30,000
We need to force them down,
make them come to us.

76
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:32,065
We'll set up three
new command posts.

77
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:35,833
Here, here and here.

78
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:37,032
Mercedes.

79
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:40,836
-Ask Dr. Ferreiro to come down.
-Yes, sir.

80
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:47,645
This will help you sleep
through the night.

81
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:51,446
Just two drops just before bed.

82
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:55,786
Two drops only.

83
00:09:58,331 --> 00:09:59,161
Very good.

84
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,330
All of it.
Good.

85
00:10:05,838 --> 00:10:09,296
Don't hesitate to call me
if you need anything. Day or night.

86
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:13,941
You or your nurse.

87
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:15,736
Good night.

88
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:19,281
Close the door
and turn off the lights, sweetie.

89
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:33,426
You have to help us.
Come up and see him.

90
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:36,897
The wound is getting worse.
His leg isn't any better.

91
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:42,838
This is all l could get.

92
00:10:43,075 --> 00:10:44,064
l'm sorry.

93
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:47,970
Captain Vidal is waiting
for you in his office.

94
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,473
Come here, Ofelia.

95
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:30,918
Jesus, your feet.
They're frozen!

96
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:41,924
Are you afraid?

97
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:45,160
A little.

98
00:11:50,242 --> 00:11:51,368
What's that noise?

99
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:54,571
Nothing, just the wind.

100
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:59,245
Nights here are different
from city nights.

101
00:12:00,186 --> 00:12:03,212
There, you hear cars-tramway.

102
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:05,621
Here the houses are old.

103
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,382
They creak.

104
00:12:10,963 --> 00:12:12,328
As if they were speaking.

105
00:12:16,368 --> 00:12:18,802
Tomorrow, l'm going
to give you a surprise.

106
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,164
-A surprise?
-Yes.

107
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:27,145
-A book?
-No, something much better.

108
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:35,087
Why did you have to get married?

109
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:41,657
l was alone too long.

110
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:45,389
l'm with you.
You weren't alone.

111
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:47,922
You were never alone.

112
00:12:50,402 --> 00:12:54,133
When you're older, you'll understand.
lt hasn't been easy for me either.

113
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,711
Your brother's at it again-

114
00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:02,706
Tell him one of your stories.

115
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:04,944
l'm sure that'll calm down.

116
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,412
My brother, my brother...

117
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:19,030
Many, many years ago,

118
00:13:19,398 --> 00:13:21,764
in a sad, faraway land,

119
00:13:21,867 --> 00:13:25,598
there was an enormous mountain
made of rough, black stone.

120
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:27,933
At sunset,

121
00:13:28,607 --> 00:13:30,871
on top of that mountain,

122
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:35,547
a magic rose blossomed every night
that made whoever plucked it immortal.

123
00:13:35,881 --> 00:13:39,317
But no one dared go near it

124
00:13:39,785 --> 00:13:42,948
because its thorns were full of poison.

125
00:13:52,264 --> 00:13:56,758
Men talked amongst themselves
about their fear of death,

126
00:13:56,836 --> 00:14:01,466
and pain, but never about the promise
of eternal life.

127
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:13,384
And every day, the rose wilted
unable to bequeath its gift to anyone.

128
00:14:15,254 --> 00:14:19,850
forgotten and lost at the top
of that cold, dark mountain,

129
00:14:20,492 --> 00:14:23,586
forever alone, until the end of time.

130
00:14:36,508 --> 00:14:37,440
Come in.

131
00:14:40,946 --> 00:14:42,743
-How is she?
-Very weak.

132
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:44,714
She'll have as much rest
as as she needs.

133
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:46,009
l'll sleep down here.

134
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,680
-And my son?
-Pardon?

135
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:54,823
Excuse us, Captain.

136
00:14:56,862 --> 00:14:58,921
My son, how is he?

137
00:14:59,698 --> 00:15:01,598
For the moment, there's no
reason to be alarmed.

138
00:15:03,802 --> 00:15:04,700
Very good.

139
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:11,599
Captain, your wife should not have
traveled at such a late stage of pregnancy.

140
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:18,546
-ls that your opinion?
-My professional opinion, yes, sir.

141
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,154
A son should be born
wherever his father is.

142
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:25,681
That's all.

143
00:15:28,193 --> 00:15:29,626
One more thing, Captain.

144
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:32,654
What makes you so sure
the baby is a male?

145
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:35,934
Don't fuck with me.

146
00:15:37,736 --> 00:15:40,398
At 8 o'clock we detected movement
in the northwestern sector.

147
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:41,902
Gunfire.

148
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:48,204
Sergeant Bayona searched the area
and captured a suspect.

149
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:50,912
The other one's his son,
here from the town.

150
00:15:50,983 --> 00:15:53,383
Captain, my father
is an honest man.

151
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,511
Let me judge that.
Take your hat off in front of me.

152
00:15:57,523 --> 00:16:00,185
We found this weapon on him.
lt's been fired.

153
00:16:00,392 --> 00:16:02,087
My father was hunting
rabbits, Captain.

154
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:03,719
Again, keep quiet.

155
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:16,067
"No God, no country, no Master"?

156
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:20,672
-Just like that-how do you like that?
-Red prpaganda, Captain.

157
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,610
lt's not propaganda, sir.

158
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:25,613
lt's an old almanac, Captain.

159
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,313
We're just farmers.

160
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:30,752
Go on.

161
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:35,757
l went up into the woods, Captain.
To hunt for rabbits.

162
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:38,522
For my daughters. They're sick.

163
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:41,599
Rabbits, uh?

164
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:45,801
Captain, if my father says so,
he was hunting rabbits.

165
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:58,877
Leave him alone.

166
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:05,085
You killed him,
You killed him!

167
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:08,583
Murderer!
Son of a bitch!

168
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:40,518
Maybe you'll learn to search
these assholes properly

169
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:42,351
before you come bothering me.

170
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:43,788
Yes, Captain.

171
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:07,485
Mother.
Mother, wake up!

172
00:18:07,986 --> 00:18:11,251
Mother, there's something in the room.

173
00:18:52,664 --> 00:18:53,596
Hello.

174
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:55,990
Did you follow me here?

175
00:18:56,768 --> 00:18:57,928
Are you a fairy?

176
00:19:00,405 --> 00:19:01,269
Look!

177
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:08,102
This is a fairy.

178
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:37,569
You want me to go with you?

179
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,612
Outside? Where?

180
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:01,286
Hello?

181
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:04,185
Hello?

182
00:21:22,247 --> 00:21:24,340
Echo.

183
00:21:31,356 --> 00:21:33,381
Echo.

184
00:21:36,261 --> 00:21:38,354
Hello?

185
00:21:41,199 --> 00:21:42,723
Hello?

186
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:46,634
lt's you.

187
00:21:51,777 --> 00:21:55,110
lt's you.
You've returned.

188
00:21:55,213 --> 00:21:57,238
Don't be frightened,
l beg you.

189
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:00,517
Look, look.

190
00:22:08,794 --> 00:22:11,422
My name is Ofelia.
Who are you?

191
00:22:11,563 --> 00:22:12,723
Me?

192
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,768
l've had so many names...

193
00:22:17,969 --> 00:22:25,967
Old names that only the wind
and the trees can pronounce.

194
00:22:26,144 --> 00:22:32,982
l am the mountain,
the forest and the earth.

195
00:22:33,785 --> 00:22:35,082
l am...

196
00:22:38,557 --> 00:22:41,355
l am a faun.

197
00:22:42,127 --> 00:22:46,154
Your most humble servant,
Your Highness.

198
00:22:46,298 --> 00:22:49,927
-No, l'm...
-You're Princess Moanna,

199
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:55,701
daughter of the king
of the underworld.

200
00:22:55,774 --> 00:22:57,503
My father was a tailor.

201
00:22:57,609 --> 00:22:59,736
You are not born of man.

202
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:03,213
lt was the moon that bore you.

203
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:05,680
Look on your left shoulder

204
00:23:05,851 --> 00:23:08,820
and you will find a mark
that proves it.

205
00:23:09,254 --> 00:23:19,220
your real father had us open portals
all over the world to allow your return.

206
00:23:19,698 --> 00:23:21,359
This is...

207
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,594
This is the last of them.

208
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:33,838
But we have to make sure
that your essence is intact,

209
00:23:34,346 --> 00:23:38,476
that you have not become a mortal.

210
00:23:42,053 --> 00:23:47,685
You must complete three tasks
before the moon is full.

211
00:23:50,629 --> 00:23:56,659
This is The Book of Crossroads.

212
00:23:57,369 --> 00:24:00,497
Open it, when you are alone

213
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:03,540
and it will show you your future,

214
00:24:03,642 --> 00:24:07,976
show you what must be done.

215
00:24:16,354 --> 00:24:17,912
But there's nothing in here.

216
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,441
Mercedes, prepare these rabbits
for dinner tonight.

217
00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:21,476
They are too young.

218
00:25:21,987 --> 00:25:25,047
-Well, maybe they'll do for a stew.
-Yes, sir.

219
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:30,518
This coffee was burnt.
Taste it yourself.

220
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:41,803
You should keep an eye on it.

221
00:25:43,608 --> 00:25:45,041
As you wish, sir.

222
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:52,572
Cook these.

223
00:25:54,352 --> 00:25:56,820
-He didn't like the coffee.
-He's nothing but a fussy dandy.

224
00:25:56,955 --> 00:25:57,856
A fussy dandy!

225
00:25:57,856 --> 00:26:00,158
We're going to need some beef
and one more chicken.

226
00:26:00,158 --> 00:26:03,992
-Where are we supposed to find that?
-The doctor's wife, the mayor's too.

227
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:07,054
Well, they eat more
than a couple of pigs.

228
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:11,727
-And they don't shut up.
-Not even underwater.

229
00:26:26,685 --> 00:26:28,710
l'll be back in a moment,
Mercedes.

230
00:26:33,825 --> 00:26:35,087
Ofelia.

231
00:26:37,662 --> 00:26:40,392
Your father is giving
a dinner party tonight.

232
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:43,632
Look what l've made for you.

233
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:46,264
Do you like it?

234
00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:51,065
What l wouldn't have given
to have such a dress...

235
00:26:51,209 --> 00:26:53,643
as fine as this when l was your age!

236
00:26:53,812 --> 00:26:54,938
And look at the shoes!

237
00:26:56,314 --> 00:26:59,010
-Do you like them?
-Yes, very pretty.

238
00:27:00,652 --> 00:27:02,313
Go on, now.
Take your bath.

239
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:07,674
Ofelia?

240
00:28:09,454 --> 00:28:10,318
Ofelia?

241
00:28:11,756 --> 00:28:15,214
Hurry up.
l want to see the dress on you.

242
00:28:15,493 --> 00:28:18,053
l want you to be beautiful
for the Captain.

243
00:28:20,899 --> 00:28:22,662
You'll look like a princess.

244
00:28:27,072 --> 00:28:28,471
A princess?

245
00:28:34,813 --> 00:28:36,542
Make sure those chickens
are cleaned properly.

246
00:28:36,648 --> 00:28:39,116
And don't forget the beans.

247
00:28:42,353 --> 00:28:46,722
-You look marvelous, my girl, just beautiful.
-What a gorgeous dress!

248
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,651
Get back to work,
stop wasting time.

249
00:28:54,466 --> 00:28:55,933
Do you want some milk with honey?

250
00:29:01,473 --> 00:29:05,432
Move back, we can't have you getting
milk on your dress, with you looking so pretty.

251
00:29:07,812 --> 00:29:11,748
Mercedes.
Do you believe in fairies?

252
00:29:12,884 --> 00:29:13,782
No.

253
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:15,951
But when l was a little girl,
l did.

254
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:18,614
l believed in a lot of things
l don't believe any more.

255
00:29:21,025 --> 00:29:22,754
Last night,
a fairy visited me.

256
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:24,820
Really?

257
00:29:26,064 --> 00:29:29,200
And it wasn't alone,
there were lots of them,

258
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,895
-And a faun, too.
-A faun?

259
00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:35,128
He was very old, very tall
and smelled like earth.

260
00:29:36,174 --> 00:29:39,200
My mother warned me
to be wary of fauns.

261
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:40,502
Mercedes!

262
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:43,414
Come with me.

263
00:29:54,092 --> 00:29:55,889
Captain,
everything is here.

264
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:58,823
Flour, salt, oil, medicine,

265
00:29:58,997 --> 00:30:02,125
olives, bacon.

266
00:30:03,234 --> 00:30:05,099
This-this is real tobacco.

267
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,469
And the ration cards.

268
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:10,171
-l need you to check the inventory.
-Very well.

269
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:14,669
Mercedes.

270
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,575
-The key.
-Yes, sir.

271
00:30:24,923 --> 00:30:26,857
-ls this the only copy?
-The only one.

272
00:30:26,958 --> 00:30:28,755
From now on, l'll carry it.

273
00:30:29,694 --> 00:30:30,626
Captain.

274
00:30:36,401 --> 00:30:37,993
Captain,
perhaps it's nothing.

275
00:30:46,411 --> 00:30:47,400
lt's them.

276
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:03,151
"Once upon a time,
when the forest was young,

277
00:31:03,728 --> 00:31:09,360
they were home to creatures
who were full of magic and wonder."

278
00:31:16,174 --> 00:31:18,506
"They protected one another,

279
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:21,973
and slept in the shade
of a colossal fig tree

280
00:31:22,413 --> 00:31:24,847
that grew on a hill, near the mill."

281
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:29,148
"But now, the tree is dying.

282
00:31:29,487 --> 00:31:33,150
lts branches are dry,
its trunk old and twisted.

283
00:31:33,958 --> 00:31:37,189
A monstrous toad
has settled in its roots

284
00:31:37,462 --> 00:31:38,929
and won't let the tree thrive.

285
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:43,428
You must put the three magic
stones in the toad's mouth

286
00:31:44,102 --> 00:31:47,560
and retrieve the golden key
from inside his belly.

287
00:31:48,172 --> 00:31:51,335
Only then will the fig tree
flourish again."

288
00:33:17,862 --> 00:33:19,659
They were here
less than twenty minutes ago.

289
00:33:20,465 --> 00:33:22,296
They left in a hurry.

290
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,340
A dozen men, at most.

291
00:33:50,261 --> 00:33:51,626
Antibiotics.

292
00:33:52,597 --> 00:33:55,760
Shit, they forgot this lottery ticket.

293
00:33:58,102 --> 00:33:59,296
They're here.

294
00:34:02,273 --> 00:34:04,639
Those sons of bitches are here.

295
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:07,637
and they're watching us.

296
00:34:17,588 --> 00:34:19,283
Hey!

297
00:34:20,625 --> 00:34:23,116
You left this behind!

298
00:34:23,861 --> 00:34:25,852
And your lottery ticket!

299
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:28,490
Why don't you come back
and get it?

300
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:31,701
Who knows?
This could be your lucky day!

301
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:46,401
Hello.
l'm Princess Moanna,

302
00:35:46,777 --> 00:35:48,244
and l'm not afraid of you.

303
00:35:51,716 --> 00:35:54,947
Aren't you ashamed
living down here,

304
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:57,178
eating all these bugs...

305
00:35:57,955 --> 00:36:00,890
and growing fat
while the tree dies?

306
00:38:43,788 --> 00:38:45,813
Have you looked in her room?
And the pantry?

307
00:38:45,956 --> 00:38:47,218
Yes, ma'am.

308
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:52,420
Have you checked the garden?

309
00:38:52,763 --> 00:38:54,560
-And the barn?
-Yes, ma'am.

310
00:38:55,399 --> 00:38:56,991
Where is that girl?

311
00:38:57,068 --> 00:38:58,365
This way, please.

312
00:38:59,403 --> 00:39:02,395
Let me to introduce you
to my wife, Carmen.

313
00:39:04,275 --> 00:39:06,140
-Charmed.
-A pleasure to meet you.

314
00:39:06,744 --> 00:39:10,043
From now on,
one ration card per family.

315
00:39:10,815 --> 00:39:11,782
Take a look.

316
00:39:11,916 --> 00:39:14,111
-One?
-Only one.

317
00:39:14,885 --> 00:39:16,682
Captain, l'm not sure
it'll be enough.

318
00:39:16,754 --> 00:39:18,085
lf people are careful,
it should be plenty.

319
00:39:18,155 --> 00:39:21,352
We can't allow anyone to send food
to the guerillas in the mountains.

320
00:39:21,492 --> 00:39:25,360
They're losing ground,
and one of them is wounded.

321
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:28,966
Excuse me, Captain,
how can you be so sure?

322
00:39:28,966 --> 00:39:31,696
We almost got them.
We found this.

323
00:39:32,503 --> 00:39:33,731
Antibiotics.

324
00:39:34,972 --> 00:39:37,338
God has already
saved their souls.

325
00:39:37,608 --> 00:39:40,236
What happens to their bodies
hardly matter to Him.

326
00:39:40,411 --> 00:39:42,902
We'll help however we can, Captain.

327
00:39:43,013 --> 00:39:45,174
We know you're not here by choice.

328
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:50,611
You're wrong about that.

329
00:39:51,822 --> 00:39:55,690
l choose to be here because l want
my son to be born in a new, clean Spain.

330
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:59,754
Because these people
hold the mistaken belief

331
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:01,588
that we're all equal.

332
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:03,666
But there's a big difference:

333
00:40:04,268 --> 00:40:06,793
the war is over and we won.

334
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:10,340
And if we need to kill every one
of these vermin to settle it,

335
00:40:11,342 --> 00:40:13,503
then we'll kill them all,
and that's that.

336
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:16,269
We're all here by choice.

337
00:40:17,281 --> 00:40:19,476
By choice!

338
00:40:22,386 --> 00:40:25,184
Put the coffee on.
l'm going for more wood.

339
00:40:25,322 --> 00:40:27,313
We'll take care of it.

340
00:40:54,318 --> 00:40:55,444
Ofelia?

341
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:10,332
So, how did you
and the Captain meet?

342
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:15,568
Ofelia's father used to make
the Captain's uniforms.

343
00:41:15,706 --> 00:41:16,673
Oh, l see...

344
00:41:17,208 --> 00:41:21,406
And after he died,
l went to work at the shop.

345
00:41:21,545 --> 00:41:23,740
A little more than a year ago,

346
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:28,448
the Captain and l met again.

347
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:30,109
Curious, isn't it!

348
00:41:30,387 --> 00:41:33,356
l mean, finding each other again?

349
00:41:34,892 --> 00:41:37,554
Oh, yes,
very, very curious.

350
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:41,525
Please, forgive my wife.
She hasn't been exposed to the world.

351
00:41:42,032 --> 00:41:44,262
She thinks these silly stories
are interesting to others.

352
00:41:45,436 --> 00:41:46,960
We understand.

353
00:41:49,373 --> 00:41:51,534
Excuse me, madam
Ofelia is here.

354
00:41:52,276 --> 00:41:53,675
Excuse me.

355
00:42:04,622 --> 00:42:06,817
Have l told you that l was acquainted
with your father, Captain?

356
00:42:07,992 --> 00:42:09,459
No.
l had no idea.

357
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:13,686
ln Morocco.

358
00:42:14,098 --> 00:42:17,067
l knew him only briefly,
but he left a great impression.

359
00:42:17,134 --> 00:42:18,328
An excellent soldier.

360
00:42:18,802 --> 00:42:23,102
The men in his battalion said that
when General Vidal died on the battlefield,

361
00:42:23,908 --> 00:42:25,569
he smashed his watch on a rock

362
00:42:25,776 --> 00:42:28,267
so that his son would know
the exact hour and minute of his death.

363
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:31,712
So he would know
how a brave man dies.

364
00:42:34,785 --> 00:42:37,310
Nonsense.
He didn't own a watch.

365
00:42:38,923 --> 00:42:42,120
What you've done hurts me.

366
00:42:43,661 --> 00:42:46,255
After your bath,
you'll go to bed without supper.

367
00:42:48,265 --> 00:42:49,357
Are you listening?

368
00:42:52,836 --> 00:42:55,600
Sometimes l think
you'll never learn to behave.

369
00:42:56,473 --> 00:42:58,464
You've disappointed me, Ofelia.

370
00:43:00,544 --> 00:43:01,943
And your father, too.

371
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:04,676
You mean the Captain?

372
00:43:05,816 --> 00:43:07,113
Him more than me.

373
00:43:22,566 --> 00:43:23,999
l've got the key.

374
00:43:27,738 --> 00:43:29,365
Take me to the Labyrinth.

375
00:44:22,626 --> 00:44:23,615
Hello.

376
00:44:25,429 --> 00:44:27,226
l got the key out.

377
00:44:28,298 --> 00:44:33,167
That's me,
and the girl is you.

378
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:34,698
And the baby?

379
00:44:36,073 --> 00:44:38,303
So... you retrieved the key.

380
00:44:41,078 --> 00:44:42,340
l'm glad.

381
00:44:50,988 --> 00:44:55,288
She believed in you
from the very beginning.

382
00:44:55,659 --> 00:44:58,355
She's so glad you succeeded.

383
00:45:04,401 --> 00:45:05,800
Keep the key.

384
00:45:06,236 --> 00:45:09,399
You'll be needing it very soon.

385
00:45:09,573 --> 00:45:14,476
And this too?
a piece of chalk.

386
00:45:15,913 --> 00:45:19,183
Two tasks remain

387
00:45:19,183 --> 00:45:24,018
and the moon is almost full.

388
00:45:24,121 --> 00:45:25,918
Be patient.

389
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:34,894
We'll soon stroll through
the seven circular gardens of your palace.

390
00:45:34,998 --> 00:45:37,523
How do l know
that what you say is true?

391
00:45:37,835 --> 00:45:43,774
Why would a poor little faun
like me lie to you?

392
00:46:05,896 --> 00:46:07,090
Proceed.

393
00:46:08,132 --> 00:46:10,566
Have your cards
ready for inspection.

394
00:46:10,801 --> 00:46:13,361
Let's go.
Your name?

395
00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:18,597
Your names, first and last.

396
00:46:19,076 --> 00:46:23,240
Narciso Pena Soriano,
at your service.

397
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:28,980
This is our daily bread
in Franco's Spain,

398
00:46:29,219 --> 00:46:33,315
kept safe in this mill!
The Reds lie...

399
00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:35,351
because in a united Spain,

400
00:46:35,526 --> 00:46:39,223
there's not a single home
without fire or bread.

401
00:46:53,443 --> 00:46:57,004
Come on, show me
what happens now?

402
00:46:57,514 --> 00:46:58,538
Show me.

403
00:47:36,587 --> 00:47:38,179
Ofelia, help me...

404
00:47:44,027 --> 00:47:45,892
Captain! Captain!

405
00:47:48,465 --> 00:47:50,023
Come quickly.

406
00:47:50,567 --> 00:47:51,864
... because in a united Spain,

407
00:47:51,969 --> 00:47:55,837
there's not a single home
without fire or bread.

408
00:47:56,306 --> 00:47:58,638
This is our daily bread
in Franco's Spain...

409
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:04,514
Your wife needs
uninterrupted rest.

410
00:48:06,383 --> 00:48:09,284
She'll have to be sedated
most of the time.

411
00:48:11,521 --> 00:48:13,853
The girl should sleep
somewhere else.

412
00:48:15,626 --> 00:48:17,685
l'll stay here until the birth.

413
00:48:18,161 --> 00:48:19,128
Make her well.

414
00:48:20,464 --> 00:48:22,489
l don't care what it costs
or what you need.

415
00:48:27,204 --> 00:48:27,898
Make her well.

416
00:48:49,226 --> 00:48:50,693
Don't worry.

417
00:48:51,862 --> 00:48:54,353
Your mother will get better soon,
you'll see.

418
00:48:57,734 --> 00:48:59,361
Having a baby is complicated.

419
00:49:00,170 --> 00:49:03,333
Then l'll never have one.

420
00:49:15,886 --> 00:49:18,719
You're helping the men
in the woods, aren't you?

421
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:31,698
Have you told anyone?

422
00:49:33,270 --> 00:49:34,396
No, l haven't.

423
00:49:36,606 --> 00:49:38,699
l don't want anything bad
to happen to you.

424
00:49:49,619 --> 00:49:50,881
Nor l to you.

425
00:49:52,422 --> 00:49:54,549
Do you know a lullaby?

426
00:49:56,526 --> 00:49:57,754
Only one...

427
00:49:58,895 --> 00:50:00,920
but l don't remember the words.

428
00:50:01,231 --> 00:50:04,826
l don't care.
l still want to hear it.

429
00:50:58,188 --> 00:51:00,952
Don't be afraid.
lt's only me.

430
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,868
-Are you ready?
-Yes.

431
00:51:13,036 --> 00:51:14,162
Then let's go.

432
00:51:19,176 --> 00:51:20,643
This is sheer madness.

433
00:51:21,011 --> 00:51:23,445
When that man finds out about us,
he'll kill us all.

434
00:51:23,947 --> 00:51:27,075
-Have you thought about that?
-Are you so afraid of him, Doctor?

435
00:51:27,484 --> 00:51:29,452
lt's not fear...

436
00:51:30,053 --> 00:51:31,418
at least not for myself.

437
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,599
Pedro!

438
00:51:44,901 --> 00:51:47,335
Pedro, My brother!

439
00:52:03,987 --> 00:52:06,148
You didn't carry out the task.

440
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:09,588
No, my mother is sick.

441
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:13,722
That's no excuse
for negligence.

442
00:52:13,997 --> 00:52:18,866
Look...
this is a mandrake root.

443
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:22,837
A plant that dreamt
of being human.

444
00:52:23,773 --> 00:52:28,437
Put it under your mother's bed

445
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:32,043
in a bowl of fresh milk.

446
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:37,609
Each morning,
give it two drops of blood.

447
00:52:38,054 --> 00:52:42,115
Now, we have no time
to waste.

448
00:52:42,425 --> 00:52:45,189
The full moon will be upon us.

449
00:52:47,564 --> 00:52:50,032
Take my pets
to guide you through.

450
00:52:50,634 --> 00:52:56,231
You're going to a very dangerous
place, so be careful.

451
00:52:56,439 --> 00:52:59,203
The thing that slumbers there,

452
00:53:00,110 --> 00:53:02,635
it is not human.

453
00:53:06,483 --> 00:53:10,749
You will see
a sumptuous feast,

454
00:53:10,854 --> 00:53:13,652
but don't eat
or drink anything.

455
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:18,590
Absolutely nothing.

456
00:53:20,263 --> 00:53:23,790
Your life depends on it.

457
00:53:44,454 --> 00:53:49,414
l've brought some Orujo,
tobacco, cheese.

458
00:53:50,126 --> 00:53:52,492
Mail for Trigo and Piloto.

459
00:53:54,564 --> 00:53:56,532
Let's see how that leg's doing,
Frenchie.

460
00:53:57,100 --> 00:54:00,536
How do you think it's doing?
lt's fucked up.

461
00:54:01,004 --> 00:54:02,596
Let's see.

462
00:54:05,675 --> 00:54:08,940
... N-North American,

463
00:54:10,313 --> 00:54:12,975
British and Canadian troops

464
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:16,610
disembarked on a small beach
in the North of F-F.

465
00:54:17,454 --> 00:54:20,150
-"France", idiot.
-F-f-f-rance.

466
00:54:20,557 --> 00:54:23,048
More than 150,000 soldiers
give us hope...

467
00:54:23,293 --> 00:54:28,094
under the command
of General Dwight D. Eisenhower...

468
00:54:28,298 --> 00:54:31,267
ls it really bad, doctor?

469
00:54:32,302 --> 00:54:33,929
Look, Frenchie.

470
00:54:35,205 --> 00:54:36,763
There's no way to save it.

471
00:54:48,652 --> 00:54:51,951
l'll try to make it
in as few cuts as possible.

472
00:54:59,729 --> 00:55:03,130
Wait a second, doctor,
just a second.

473
00:55:38,336 --> 00:55:44,502
"Use the chalk to trace a door
anywhere in your room."

474
00:55:49,681 --> 00:55:53,640
"Once the door's open,
start the hourglass."

475
00:55:55,954 --> 00:55:58,081
"Let the fairies guide you."

476
00:56:03,462 --> 00:56:06,795
"Don't eat or drink anything,
during your stay,

477
00:56:06,155 --> 00:56:10,717
and come back
before the last grain of sand falls.

478
00:58:19,688 --> 00:58:20,712
No...

479
00:58:23,559 --> 00:58:24,753
This other one.

480
01:01:00,649 --> 01:01:02,276
No! No!

481
01:02:18,093 --> 01:02:19,993
We'll soon have reinforcements
from Jaca.

482
01:02:20,429 --> 01:02:24,331
Fifty men or more.
Then we'll go head to head with Vidal.

483
01:02:25,367 --> 01:02:27,858
And then what?

484
01:02:28,570 --> 01:02:32,267
You kill him, they'll send another
just like him. And another...

485
01:02:32,841 --> 01:02:36,072
You're screwed, no guns,
no safe shelter...

486
01:02:36,178 --> 01:02:40,410
You need food, medicine.
You must take care of Mercedes.

487
01:02:40,649 --> 01:02:42,378
lf you really love her,
you'd cross the border with her.

488
01:02:42,451 --> 01:02:44,885
-This is a lost cause.
-l'm staying here, doctor.

489
01:02:45,220 --> 01:02:46,187
There's no choice.

490
01:02:58,600 --> 01:02:59,760
You have to leave.

491
01:03:01,536 --> 01:03:04,471
Here's the key,
but you can't go down there now.

492
01:03:04,740 --> 01:03:06,970
lt's exactly what he expects.

493
01:03:10,145 --> 01:03:11,112
Leave it to me.

494
01:03:15,183 --> 01:03:16,309
l'm a coward.

495
01:03:17,419 --> 01:03:19,944
No, you're not.

496
01:03:21,123 --> 01:03:22,351
Yes, l am.

497
01:03:22,991 --> 01:03:27,428
A coward... for living
next to that son of a bitch,

498
01:03:28,730 --> 01:03:31,528
doing his laundry, making his bed,
feeding him.

499
01:03:35,237 --> 01:03:37,728
What if the doctor's right
and we can't win?

500
01:03:42,044 --> 01:03:44,274
At least we'll make things
harder for that bastard.

501
01:05:39,161 --> 01:05:40,128
Captain Vidal...

502
01:05:42,230 --> 01:05:44,755
Her temperature's down.
l don't know how, but it is.

503
01:05:45,567 --> 01:05:46,499
But she still has a fever?

504
01:05:47,135 --> 01:05:50,036
Yes, but it's a good sign.
Her body is responding.

505
01:05:51,840 --> 01:05:52,807
Listen to me.

506
01:05:53,475 --> 01:05:56,501
lf you have to choose,
save the baby.

507
01:05:56,678 --> 01:05:59,203
That boy will bear my name
and my father's name.

508
01:05:59,347 --> 01:06:00,336
Save him.

509
01:06:36,351 --> 01:06:37,318
Brother...

510
01:06:39,321 --> 01:06:40,253
Little brother...

511
01:06:42,490 --> 01:06:44,014
lf you can hear me,

512
01:06:45,126 --> 01:06:47,287
things out here aren't too good.

513
01:06:49,164 --> 01:06:51,155
But soon you'll have to come out.

514
01:06:52,434 --> 01:06:54,061
You've made Mama very sick.

515
01:06:56,271 --> 01:06:59,900
l want to ask you one favor
for when you come out,

516
01:07:01,042 --> 01:07:02,168
just one:

517
01:07:03,511 --> 01:07:05,172
don't hurt her.

518
01:07:06,381 --> 01:07:09,612
You'll meet her,
she's very pretty,

519
01:07:10,452 --> 01:07:12,716
even though sometimes she's sad
for days at a time.

520
01:07:13,822 --> 01:07:15,687
You'll see, when she smiles,

521
01:07:17,292 --> 01:07:18,782
you'll love her.

522
01:07:21,162 --> 01:07:24,461
Listen, if you do what l say,

523
01:07:24,766 --> 01:07:26,324
l'll make you a promise,

524
01:07:27,269 --> 01:07:30,898
l'll take you to my kingdom,
and l'll make you a prince.

525
01:07:31,906 --> 01:07:35,069
l promise you, a prince.

526
01:08:01,736 --> 01:08:04,261
l sounded the whistle,
but they wouldn't move.

527
01:08:04,472 --> 01:08:06,872
l tried to stop, but it was too late.

528
01:08:06,941 --> 01:08:09,375
The fireman and l
jumped outjust in time,

529
01:08:09,611 --> 01:08:11,010
but look at the mess they made.

530
01:08:14,182 --> 01:08:15,911
What did they steal
from the freight cars?

531
01:08:16,418 --> 01:08:18,215
They didn't open a single one.

532
01:08:18,486 --> 01:08:19,919
What the hell are you talking about?

533
01:08:20,055 --> 01:08:22,353
This whole mess...
They didn't open any of the cars.

534
01:08:22,557 --> 01:08:26,857
-They didn't take anything.
-Nothing? Are you sure?

535
01:08:27,228 --> 01:08:31,096
God only knows what they wanted,
other than to waste our time.

536
01:08:47,949 --> 01:08:49,712
They came out of nowhere, Captain.

537
01:08:53,054 --> 01:08:56,217
They have grenades,
they went up hill.

538
01:09:00,929 --> 01:09:03,727
Captain, we've surrounded
a small unit that fell behind.

539
01:09:03,965 --> 01:09:05,557
They took cover up on the hill.

540
01:09:40,635 --> 01:09:45,129
Go ahead, Serrano, don't be afraid,
this is the only decent way to die.

541
01:10:28,850 --> 01:10:30,044
Serrano!

542
01:10:47,268 --> 01:10:50,294
Let me see.

543
01:10:55,043 --> 01:10:56,135
Can you talk?

544
01:11:00,548 --> 01:11:01,515
Damn it!

545
01:11:20,101 --> 01:11:22,695
These are useless! They can't talk.

546
01:11:32,013 --> 01:11:34,675
Captain,
this one's still alive.

547
01:11:38,753 --> 01:11:40,118
Shot in the leg.

548
01:11:46,060 --> 01:11:47,425
-What's happened?
-They caught one.

549
01:11:47,529 --> 01:11:49,895
They took one of them alive.
And they're taking him to the storeroom.

550
01:11:55,103 --> 01:11:56,229
Mercedes!

551
01:11:57,071 --> 01:11:59,301
Pedro... Pedro...

552
01:12:16,758 --> 01:12:17,725
Mercedes?

553
01:12:18,660 --> 01:12:21,652
-l need to get into the storeroom.
-Not now.

554
01:12:22,163 --> 01:12:23,494
Move away!

555
01:12:50,592 --> 01:12:52,822
That's plenty, dear.

556
01:12:56,397 --> 01:12:57,887
Should l take this up?

557
01:13:17,752 --> 01:13:20,220
Here, half the dose.

558
01:13:20,722 --> 01:13:22,519
l don't think l need it.

559
01:13:22,824 --> 01:13:25,816
l feel better, much better.

560
01:13:26,094 --> 01:13:28,494
l don't understand.
But l'm glad.

561
01:13:31,833 --> 01:13:32,424
Mother...

562
01:13:47,181 --> 01:13:49,945
Damn, this cigarette is good!

563
01:13:50,718 --> 01:13:54,119
Real tobacco hard to find.

564
01:13:55,757 --> 01:13:58,157
G-G-Go to hell.

565
01:14:00,828 --> 01:14:04,821
Damn, Garces. We catch one
and he turns out to be a stutterer.

566
01:14:05,099 --> 01:14:07,226
We'll be here all night.

567
01:14:07,435 --> 01:14:09,403
As long as he talks.

568
01:14:15,276 --> 01:14:17,107
Garces is right.

569
01:14:17,945 --> 01:14:20,243
You'd do better
to tell us everything.

570
01:14:20,948 --> 01:14:24,315
But to make sure it happens,
l brought along a few tools.

571
01:14:26,654 --> 01:14:28,849
Just things you pick up
along the way.

572
01:14:29,057 --> 01:14:31,491
At first, l won't be able to trust you,

573
01:14:32,060 --> 01:14:35,518
but after l use this,
you'll own up to a few things.

574
01:14:37,565 --> 01:14:39,032
When we get to these,

575
01:14:40,068 --> 01:14:43,731
we'll have developed...
how can l put this-?

576
01:14:44,138 --> 01:14:46,732
A closer bond,
much like brothers.

577
01:14:48,176 --> 01:14:49,700
You'll see.

578
01:14:51,713 --> 01:14:53,374
And when we get to this one,

579
01:14:54,749 --> 01:14:57,183
l'll believe anything you tell me.

580
01:15:09,497 --> 01:15:10,794
l'll make you a deal.

581
01:15:10,865 --> 01:15:14,392
lf you can count to three
without st-t-tuttering,

582
01:15:14,736 --> 01:15:15,930
you can go.

583
01:15:18,106 --> 01:15:21,041
Don't look at him, look at me.

584
01:15:21,309 --> 01:15:23,072
Above me, there's no one.

585
01:15:23,611 --> 01:15:25,511
-Garces!
-Yes, Captain?

586
01:15:25,780 --> 01:15:29,307
lf l say this asshole can leave,
would anybody contradict me?

587
01:15:29,383 --> 01:15:31,010
No one, Captain.
He can leave.

588
01:15:31,753 --> 01:15:35,883
There you have it.
Count to three.

589
01:15:52,273 --> 01:15:54,901
-One.
-Good.

590
01:15:59,147 --> 01:16:00,114
Two.

591
01:16:01,883 --> 01:16:04,784
One more and you will be free.

592
01:16:21,702 --> 01:16:22,669
Shame.

593
01:16:34,582 --> 01:16:38,609
Your mother is much better,
Your Highness.

594
01:16:40,054 --> 01:16:46,118
Surely, you must be relieved.

595
01:16:46,627 --> 01:16:48,720
Yes, thank you.

596
01:16:49,130 --> 01:16:52,588
But things haven't turned out so well.

597
01:16:53,501 --> 01:16:54,593
No?

598
01:16:56,404 --> 01:17:00,033
-l had an accident.
-An accident?

599
01:17:00,208 --> 01:17:01,175
Yes.

600
01:17:10,451 --> 01:17:13,352
-You broke the rules!
-lt was only two grapes!

601
01:17:13,454 --> 01:17:15,046
l thought no one would notice.

602
01:17:16,457 --> 01:17:19,551
-We've made a mistake!
-A mistake?

603
01:17:20,294 --> 01:17:24,025
You failed.
You can never return.

604
01:17:24,131 --> 01:17:27,794
-lt was an accident!
-You cannot return.

605
01:17:27,902 --> 01:17:31,861
The moon will be full in three days.

606
01:17:32,440 --> 01:17:38,140
Your spirit shall forever remain
among the humans.

607
01:17:38,246 --> 01:17:42,114
You shall age like them,
you shall die like them

608
01:17:42,183 --> 01:17:46,279
and all memory of you
shall fade in time.

609
01:17:46,854 --> 01:17:50,847
And we'll vanish along with it.

610
01:17:51,492 --> 01:17:55,292
You will never see us again.

611
01:18:06,007 --> 01:18:09,738
Good day, doctor.
Sorry to wake you so early,

612
01:18:10,478 --> 01:18:12,207
but l think we need your help.

613
01:18:35,536 --> 01:18:37,094
My God, what have you done to him?

614
01:18:37,271 --> 01:18:38,397
Not much.

615
01:18:40,341 --> 01:18:42,138
But things are getting better.

616
01:18:50,051 --> 01:18:54,784
l like having you handy, Doctor.
lt has its advantages.

617
01:18:56,324 --> 01:18:57,791
Serrano, stay here.

618
01:18:57,959 --> 01:18:59,017
l talked.

619
01:19:00,428 --> 01:19:01,656
Not much.

620
01:19:04,031 --> 01:19:07,467
-B-b-but l talked.
-l'm sorry.

621
01:19:08,202 --> 01:19:09,794
l'm so sorry.

622
01:19:16,944 --> 01:19:22,075
Kill me.
Kill me now, please.

623
01:19:38,265 --> 01:19:39,857
Son of a bitch.

624
01:20:00,955 --> 01:20:02,889
lt'll take away the pain.

625
01:20:09,263 --> 01:20:10,730
lt's almost over.

626
01:20:19,473 --> 01:20:20,804
Watch Dr. Ferreiro,

627
01:20:20,941 --> 01:20:22,408
-l'll be right there.
-Yes, Captain.

628
01:20:45,966 --> 01:20:47,558
You're not moving anymore.

629
01:20:49,070 --> 01:20:50,503
Are you sick?

630
01:20:53,707 --> 01:20:56,232
What are you doing down there?

631
01:21:09,824 --> 01:21:11,485
-Call him!
-Who?

632
01:21:11,592 --> 01:21:13,992
Who else, you imbecile?
Ferreiro!

633
01:21:38,085 --> 01:21:40,178
What the hell is this?

634
01:21:43,257 --> 01:21:44,849
No! No, no!

635
01:21:45,092 --> 01:21:48,687
Leave her.
Leave her alone, please!

636
01:21:50,397 --> 01:21:52,957
Look at this! Look what she
was hiding under your bed!

637
01:21:53,367 --> 01:21:54,561
What do you think of this?

638
01:21:59,173 --> 01:22:03,667
Ofelia, what is this thing doing
under the bed?

639
01:22:03,878 --> 01:22:07,814
lt's a magic root
the faun gave me.

640
01:22:07,982 --> 01:22:10,576
This is all because of thatjunk
you let her read.

641
01:22:10,918 --> 01:22:11,885
Look what you've done!

642
01:22:12,019 --> 01:22:16,080
Please, leave us alone.
l'll talk to her, darling.

643
01:22:16,724 --> 01:22:19,659
Fine.
As you wish.

644
01:22:21,462 --> 01:22:24,158
He told me you would get better.
And you did.

645
01:22:24,431 --> 01:22:27,332
Ofelia, you have to listen
to your father.

646
01:22:28,669 --> 01:22:29,761
You have to stop all this.

647
01:22:30,437 --> 01:22:33,065
No. l want to leave this place!

648
01:22:33,407 --> 01:22:36,570
Please, take me away from here!
Let's just go, Please!

649
01:22:36,710 --> 01:22:39,008
Things are not that simple.

650
01:22:41,248 --> 01:22:43,079
You're getting older,

651
01:22:44,118 --> 01:22:47,485
soon you'll see that life
isn't like your fairy tales.

652
01:22:48,088 --> 01:22:50,283
The world is a cruel place.

653
01:22:51,659 --> 01:22:55,390
And you'll learn that,
even if it hurts.

654
01:22:56,997 --> 01:22:59,522
-No! No!
-Ofelia!

655
01:23:00,868 --> 01:23:05,828
Magic does not exist.
Not for you, me or anyone else.

656
01:23:17,651 --> 01:23:19,915
Mom! Help!

657
01:23:20,387 --> 01:23:21,820
Help!

658
01:23:22,690 --> 01:23:23,952
Help!

659
01:23:29,997 --> 01:23:30,964
Why did you do it?

660
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:34,961
lt was the only thing l could do.

661
01:23:36,303 --> 01:23:38,533
No. You could have obeyed me.

662
01:23:40,307 --> 01:23:42,571
l could have, but l didn't.

663
01:23:44,511 --> 01:23:47,036
lt would have been better for you.
You know it.

664
01:23:48,449 --> 01:23:51,418
l don't understand.
Why didn't you obey me?

665
01:23:51,719 --> 01:23:57,851
To obey-just like that-for the sake
of obeying, without questioning...

666
01:23:59,593 --> 01:24:02,585
that's something only people
like you can do, Captain.

667
01:24:40,034 --> 01:24:41,365
Captain!

668
01:24:47,675 --> 01:24:50,041
Garces! Call the troop paramedic.

669
01:24:50,244 --> 01:24:52,735
-Get up immediately!
-Yes, Captain.

670
01:25:27,381 --> 01:25:29,246
Your wife is dead.

671
01:25:38,926 --> 01:25:42,418
Because the paths to the Lord
are inscrutable.

672
01:25:42,896 --> 01:25:44,761
Because the essence
of His forgiveness

673
01:25:44,832 --> 01:25:48,165
lies in His word
and in His mystery.

674
01:25:49,036 --> 01:25:52,028
Because although God
sends us the message,

675
01:25:52,172 --> 01:25:54,800
it is our task to decipher it.

676
01:25:55,676 --> 01:25:57,507
Because when we open our arms

677
01:25:57,678 --> 01:26:02,547
the earth takes in only a hollow
and senseless shell.

678
01:26:03,917 --> 01:26:06,852
Far away now is the soul
in its eternal glory.

679
01:26:07,454 --> 01:26:11,117
Because it is in pain
that we find the meaning of life.

680
01:26:11,925 --> 01:26:14,860
And the state of grace
that we lose when we are born.

681
01:26:16,196 --> 01:26:21,463
Because God, in His infinite wisdom,
puts the solution in our hands.

682
01:26:25,539 --> 01:26:28,030
And because it is only
in His physical absence,

683
01:26:28,208 --> 01:26:32,474
that the place He occupies
in our souls is reaffirmed.

684
01:26:54,435 --> 01:26:57,927
You knew
Dr. Ferreiro pretty well,
didn't you, Mercedes?

685
01:26:59,006 --> 01:27:01,941
We all knew him, sir.
Everyone around here.

686
01:27:03,911 --> 01:27:07,540
The stutterer spoke of an informer.
Here... at the mill.

687
01:27:08,715 --> 01:27:12,583
Can you imagine?
Right under my nose.

688
01:27:14,421 --> 01:27:17,857
Mercedes, please.

689
01:27:27,601 --> 01:27:29,034
What must you think of me?

690
01:27:30,304 --> 01:27:31,896
You must think that
l'm a monster.

691
01:27:32,439 --> 01:27:35,340
lt doesn't matter
what someone like me thinks, sir.

692
01:27:45,519 --> 01:27:48,420
l want you to the storehouse
and bring me some more liquor, please.

693
01:27:48,689 --> 01:27:51,886
Yes, sir.
Goodnight, sir.

694
01:27:52,459 --> 01:27:56,418
Mercedes,
aren't you forgetting something?

695
01:27:57,464 --> 01:27:58,453
Sir?

696
01:28:03,504 --> 01:28:04,402
The key.

697
01:28:05,439 --> 01:28:07,771
l do have the only copy, don't l?

698
01:28:08,976 --> 01:28:09,965
Yes, sir.

699
01:28:11,512 --> 01:28:15,505
You know, there's an odd detail
that's been bothering me.

700
01:28:15,849 --> 01:28:17,783
Maybe it's not important, but...

701
01:28:18,051 --> 01:28:19,643
the day they broke into
the storehouse,

702
01:28:19,887 --> 01:28:22,219
with all those grenades
and explosives,

703
01:28:23,123 --> 01:28:24,613
the lock itself wasn't forced.

704
01:28:26,927 --> 01:28:30,522
As l said, it's probably
not important.

705
01:28:34,134 --> 01:28:35,431
Be very careful.

706
01:28:37,538 --> 01:28:38,766
Good night, sir.

707
01:29:21,615 --> 01:29:24,379
Ofelia, Ofelia!

708
01:29:24,651 --> 01:29:26,676
Ofelia, l'm leaving tonight.

709
01:29:27,220 --> 01:29:30,712
-Where to?
-l can't tell you. l can't tell you...

710
01:29:30,824 --> 01:29:33,850
-Take me with you.
-No, no. l can't.

711
01:29:33,961 --> 01:29:36,987
l can't, my child. But l'll come
back for you, l promise.

712
01:29:37,130 --> 01:29:38,256
Take me with you.

713
01:30:03,156 --> 01:30:04,453
l heard something.

714
01:30:09,429 --> 01:30:12,592
lt's nothing, don't worry.

715
01:30:21,942 --> 01:30:22,931
Mercedes.

716
01:30:25,112 --> 01:30:26,079
Ofelia.

717
01:30:35,088 --> 01:30:36,715
How long have
you known about her?

718
01:30:42,129 --> 01:30:43,687
How long have you been
laughing at me?

719
01:30:43,930 --> 01:30:45,124
Little bitch!

720
01:30:46,466 --> 01:30:47,728
Watch her!

721
01:30:51,204 --> 01:30:52,933
And if anyone tries to get in,

722
01:30:53,907 --> 01:30:55,499
kill her first.

723
01:31:09,823 --> 01:31:10,790
Dry meat.

724
01:31:14,394 --> 01:31:15,383
Tobacco.

725
01:31:16,697 --> 01:31:19,461
lf you had asked for it, l would have
given this to you, Mercedes.

726
01:31:26,673 --> 01:31:28,903
l want the names of whoever
wrote these letters.

727
01:31:30,644 --> 01:31:32,805
And l want them
in front of me, tomorrow.

728
01:31:33,180 --> 01:31:34,204
Yes, Captain.

729
01:31:37,084 --> 01:31:38,551
You can go, Garces.

730
01:31:40,120 --> 01:31:41,519
You're sure, Captain?

731
01:31:43,957 --> 01:31:46,721
For God's sake,
she's just a woman.

732
01:31:50,697 --> 01:31:52,858
That's what you've always thought.

733
01:31:54,034 --> 01:31:56,832
That's why l was able to get away with it.

734
01:31:57,070 --> 01:32:01,734
-l was invisible to you.
-Damn.

735
01:32:02,576 --> 01:32:06,376
You've found my weakness:
Pride.

736
01:32:07,781 --> 01:32:11,114
But it's your weak points
we're interested in.

737
01:32:13,487 --> 01:32:16,422
lt's very simple: you will talk...

738
01:32:18,125 --> 01:32:19,149
And l have to know

739
01:32:21,128 --> 01:32:22,425
that everything you say is the truth.

740
01:32:23,663 --> 01:32:27,929
We have a few things here
strictly for that purpose.

741
01:32:29,870 --> 01:32:31,132
Nothing complicated.

742
01:32:33,974 --> 01:32:35,498
Things we learn on the job.

743
01:32:37,611 --> 01:32:39,579
At first...

744
01:32:56,696 --> 01:32:59,927
l'm not some old man!
Not a wounded prisoner!

745
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:04,061
Mother Fucker!
Don't you dare touch the girl?

746
01:33:04,304 --> 01:33:06,067
Won't be the first pig l gutted.

747
01:33:29,563 --> 01:33:30,655
Look! He let her go.

748
01:33:33,166 --> 01:33:34,463
The fuck did you say?

749
01:33:42,475 --> 01:33:45,171
Get her!
Come on! Bring her to me!

750
01:33:45,612 --> 01:33:47,443
Bring her to me, damn it!

751
01:33:47,581 --> 01:33:49,071
Mount up!

752
01:34:52,012 --> 01:34:54,503
lt'll be better if you come
with me without struggling.

753
01:34:55,148 --> 01:34:57,173
The Captain said that if you behave...

754
01:35:01,821 --> 01:35:03,584
Don't be a fool, sweetheart.

755
01:35:03,957 --> 01:35:05,515
lf anyone's going to kill you...

756
01:35:07,627 --> 01:35:08,821
l'd rather it be me.

757
01:36:19,199 --> 01:36:24,136
l've decided to give you
one last chance.

758
01:36:29,409 --> 01:36:31,104
Do you promise to do what l say?

759
01:36:33,113 --> 01:36:37,345
Will you do everything l tell you,
without question?

760
01:36:39,152 --> 01:36:42,121
This is your last chance.

761
01:36:43,256 --> 01:36:46,384
Then listen to me.

762
01:36:46,826 --> 01:36:49,226
Fetch your brother

763
01:36:49,629 --> 01:36:52,291
and bring him to the labyrinth,

764
01:36:52,432 --> 01:36:56,835
as quickly as you can,
Your Highness.

765
01:36:57,070 --> 01:36:58,401
My brother?

766
01:36:58,638 --> 01:36:59,969
We need him.

767
01:37:00,106 --> 01:37:03,166
-But...
-No more questions.

768
01:37:06,179 --> 01:37:07,737
The door's locked.

769
01:37:08,748 --> 01:37:14,653
ln that case,
create your own door.

770
01:40:03,289 --> 01:40:04,722
Captain, with your permission.

771
01:40:08,094 --> 01:40:09,118
Come quickly.

772
01:40:09,896 --> 01:40:13,161
-Now what?
-Serrano is back. He's wounded.

773
01:40:14,133 --> 01:40:15,498
Wounded?

774
01:41:01,714 --> 01:41:03,113
Where's Garces?

775
01:41:10,590 --> 01:41:11,579
How many were there?

776
01:41:12,125 --> 01:41:14,355
l don't know exactly, Captain.

777
01:41:14,794 --> 01:41:16,284
Fifty men, at least.

778
01:41:16,396 --> 01:41:19,991
The rest of the men didn't make it.
Our watch posts are not responding.

779
01:41:20,133 --> 01:41:23,728
-How many men we have left?
-Twenty, maybe less, sir.

780
01:41:34,547 --> 01:41:37,914
We're leaving.
Together.

781
01:41:38,951 --> 01:41:40,213
Don't be afraid.

782
01:41:41,087 --> 01:41:42,748
Nothing is going to happen to you.

783
01:41:49,128 --> 01:41:50,755
Put them on picket duty
at the tree line.

784
01:41:50,897 --> 01:41:53,024
lf the rest of the squad gets back,
have it report immediately to me.

785
01:41:53,266 --> 01:41:56,758
Radio for reinforcements, now.

786
01:41:56,936 --> 01:41:58,233
Yes, Captain.

787
01:42:25,064 --> 01:42:26,292
Leave him!

788
01:43:12,378 --> 01:43:13,640
Ofelia!

789
01:44:40,800 --> 01:44:43,496
Quickly, Your Majesty,

790
01:44:43,769 --> 01:44:46,294
give him to me.

791
01:44:46,839 --> 01:44:49,933
The full moon is high in the sky,

792
01:44:50,042 --> 01:44:52,875
we can open the portal.

793
01:44:53,779 --> 01:44:55,406
Why is that in your hand?

794
01:44:56,916 --> 01:45:01,819
The portal will only open
if we offer the blood of an innocent.

795
01:45:02,121 --> 01:45:06,558
Just a drop of blood.
A pinprick, that's all.

796
01:45:06,659 --> 01:45:09,253
lt's the final task.

797
01:45:09,562 --> 01:45:10,893
Hurry.

798
01:45:13,599 --> 01:45:16,693
You promised to obey me!

799
01:45:17,136 --> 01:45:19,366
-Give me the boy!
-No!

800
01:45:19,972 --> 01:45:22,099
My brother stays with me.

801
01:45:22,341 --> 01:45:28,246
You would give up your sacred rights
for this brat you barely know?

802
01:45:28,314 --> 01:45:31,112
Yes, l would.

803
01:45:32,418 --> 01:45:34,886
You would give up
your throne for him?

804
01:45:35,021 --> 01:45:39,617
He who has caused you
such misery, such humiliation?

805
01:45:40,159 --> 01:45:43,026
Yes, l would.

806
01:45:47,133 --> 01:45:52,833
As you wish, Your Highness.

807
01:46:08,554 --> 01:46:09,578
No!

808
01:47:08,280 --> 01:47:09,269
My son.

809
01:47:36,876 --> 01:47:38,537
Tell my son...

810
01:47:44,383 --> 01:47:46,476
Tell him what time his father died.

811
01:47:47,286 --> 01:47:48,583
-Tell him that l...
-No.

812
01:47:49,789 --> 01:47:51,552
He won't even know your name.

813
01:49:34,393 --> 01:49:36,418
Arise, my daughter.

814
01:49:39,732 --> 01:49:40,994
Come.

815
01:50:07,226 --> 01:50:08,454
Father.

816
01:50:08,961 --> 01:50:12,590
You have spilled your own blood
rather than that of an innocent.

817
01:50:13,365 --> 01:50:17,199
That was the final task,
and the most important.

818
01:50:27,713 --> 01:50:32,980
And you chose well,
Your Highness.

819
01:50:33,219 --> 01:50:34,880
Come here with me,

820
01:50:35,754 --> 01:50:37,881
and sit by your father's side.

821
01:50:38,357 --> 01:50:40,552
He's been waiting for you so long.

822
01:51:33,479 --> 01:51:37,245
And it is said the princess
returned to her father's kingdom.

823
01:51:38,183 --> 01:51:43,519
That she reigned there with justice
and a kind heart for many centuries.

824
01:51:44,423 --> 01:51:46,687
That she was loved by her people.

825
01:51:46,959 --> 01:51:51,658
And that she left behind
small traces of her time on earth,

826
01:51:52,765 --> 01:51:57,600
visible only to those
who know where to look.
