1
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,950
Leondina, what's the matter?

2
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:28,910
Look, it's Jesus!
Where are they going?

3
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,870
Where are you taking
the statue?

4
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,710
- What?
- Where are you taking it?

5
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,550
They're taking it to the Pope!

6
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,510
He wants the phone number! No!

7
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,150
Hey, you, come here, please.

8
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,030
What did they eat at table N° 16?

9
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,070
The prince ate snails.

10
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,670
- What wine?
- Soave.

11
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:33,710
- No, Valpolicella! Hi, Marcello!
- Hi.

12
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,870
Snails and Valpolicella.
Let me take a picture.

13
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,070
It's not possible!

14
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,110
Why do you pay him?
I give out information!

15
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:06,590
Manager, stop that photographer!

16
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:14,150
- Give me the film!
- Oh, come on!

17
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,990
A light.

18
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,830
- Listen, honey, come here.
- Me?

19
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:35,870
- I'm talking to you. - What's
the matter? - I must talk to you.

20
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,950
Good evening, how are you?

21
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,470
- Sit down.
- There's no chair.

22
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,120
- Squat down!
- Sorry.

23
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:51,040
- Naughty!
- Why?

24
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,070
You're naughty.

25
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:56,590
And I'll break your little face!

26
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:02,310
Just a little publicity.

27
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,790
You got her into trouble
with her husband.

28
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:09,150
Do I worry
about your being cuckold?

29
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,630
- You're not a journalist.
- Great journalism!

30
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,350
- Shut up! Be careful!
- You'll kill me!

31
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,630
- Has he arrived?
- Not yet.

32
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:35,150
Tell him he's an idiot!
Whisky!

33
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,400
This place is unbearable!

34
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:29,870
Good evening, Maddalena.
Alone? Want to dance?

35
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,910
No.

36
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,630
Want to drink some Vodka?

37
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:38,190
No. Everything's wrong tonight.
I'm leaving.

38
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:42,230
- Can I accompany you?
- I don't know...

39
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:10,110
- Your friends.
- Marcello, where are you going?

40
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,950
- Miss Maddalena!
- Leave me alone tonight!

41
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,790
Welcome back!
More beautiful than a star!

42
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,910
Always the same song.
They never change?

43
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,940
Paparazzo, stop it!
You're a public figure!

44
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,110
Marcello, where are you going?

45
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,470
I'd like to live in a new city.

46
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,670
I like Rome very much.

47
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:51,470
It's a jungle
where one can hide well.

48
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,070
I'd like to hide too, but I can't.

49
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:05,430
- What'll we do?
- Take a ride.

50
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:16,310
- I'm fed up with Rome! I'd like
an island. - If you buy one.

51
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:21,340
I considered the possibility.
Would I really go there?

52
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,030
Your problem is
you have too much money.

53
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:29,070
Your problem is
you don't have enough.

54
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:33,630
Meanwhile here we are,
the two of us.

55
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:38,470
That's not a problem. We're among
the few people to be unhappy.

56
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,630
- What did you do here?
- Nothing.

57
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:45,950
You're so rich, if you fall,
you'll land standing up.

58
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,500
- You think so?
- Sure.

59
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,950
I can't even stand up!

60
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,950
I need an enthusiastic push.

61
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,700
When I make love there's tension.

62
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:03,750
- Only love gives me strength.
- Long live love!

63
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,670
Annamaria, look here!

64
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,800
That car looks like an apartment!

65
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:13,990
- Are you Liliana?
- I'm not Liliana.

66
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,830
- And who are you?
- Good evening.

67
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:20,460
- Good evening.
- Who are you talking to?

68
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,510
Who's there?

69
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,870
Liliana went to Milan.

70
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,830
- Are you coming with us?
- Me?

71
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,750
Yes... you, come with us.

72
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:37,510
She says if I go with her.
Should I?

73
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,870
Let's take a ride with this girl.

74
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,110
What do you want to do?

75
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:48,510
Nothing. I'll take her home.
You know her?

76
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:52,270
No. I don't think so.

77
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,150
I'm going to eat.
I'll see you there.

78
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,800
Turn off the lights, fanatic!

79
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,110
Get paid.
They're richer than Onassis.

80
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:14,670
- Are you coming? - If you
take me home, I'd appreciate it.

81
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,710
- Are you coming?
- Nope.

82
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,910
But I live far.

83
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,550
- Sit on the back.
- Thanks.

84
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:30,830
- Are you okay there? - Yes.
- Bye! - Bye, Annamaria.

85
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:34,870
- Where do you live?
- At Cessati Spiriti.

86
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:47,470
- Is that your car?
- Yes.

87
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,750
- Did you buy it for her?
- Her father.

88
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:55,310
All my father gave me
were beatings!

89
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:59,390
- Do you know my father?
- You introduced him to me.

90
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:02,270
Where do your parents live?

91
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:06,830
- In Cesena.
- Is there the sea? - No.

92
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,870
Well, how is it going?

93
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,790
So, so...

94
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,470
Things didn't go well tonight?

95
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:19,310
A truffle gave me
1,000 lira and cigarettes.

96
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:25,300
- Was he young or old?
- I didn't look at him in the face!

97
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,430
- Would you go with a woman
like this one? - No.

98
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:37,300
Why?
She's not worse than many others.

99
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:41,950
- You don't go with women
like this? - Yes, sometimes.

100
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:48,670
Listen, Gregory Peck... I'd like
to know something. What'll we do?

101
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:53,430
- We'll take you home, okay?
- Yes.

102
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:59,780
- Why? What did you think?
- Me, nothing!

103
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,510
We'll wake everyone up.
Turn off the radio!

104
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:16,220
- We'll leave immediately.
- Is someone home?

105
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,390
- What's she saying?
- If someone is home.

106
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:25,150
- No, my cousin is in Velletri.
- Will you offer us some coffee?

107
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,830
Gladly. I make good coffee.

108
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,550
Don't expect a palace!

109
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,070
I'll lead the way.

110
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,230
The coffee.

111
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:19,270
Watch out for the stairs.
The other evening a man...

112
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:24,710
Darn! It's flooded again!

113
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,430
Wait a moment.

114
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:31,630
"The engineer!"
He should have been a grave-digger!

115
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:36,510
That'll be the day! I've been
absolving all the devil's sins!

116
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,670
Damn!

117
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,100
I'll take you to the bedroom.

118
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:51,830
It's flooded here too.
I'll make some coffee.

119
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,830
Some recommendation is needed.

120
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:59,860
- I made a request two years ago
but... - Don't worry.

121
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,480
I make some coffee, okay?

122
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,070
Would you close the door?

123
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,750
You want to make love here?

124
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,070
No?

125
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,710
I'll leave your coffee here.

126
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:15,790
You didn't agree before?
Are you crazy?

127
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:21,350
They did everything!
I hope they give me 2,000 lira!

128
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,470
2,000? I set the price!

129
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:28,510
- Are they husband and wife?
- Oh, come on!

130
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:04,510
Here. Many thanks.
Must I back up?

131
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:09,030
No. Turn right at the end.
Can I give you a little kiss?

132
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:13,870
- Thanks. Come back when you want!
- Bye.

133
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,910
Slow down with that car!

134
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,470
Oh, my God!

135
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,630
Emma!

136
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:21,790
Emma! Emma!
Emma, answer, what happened?

137
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:33,020
What did you do? Crazy fool!

138
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,060
Emma!

139
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:55,150
It's nothing. Keep calm!
I'll take you to the hospital.

140
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:58,030
Why are you so crazy?

141
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:01,470
You want to ruin me, huh?

142
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:04,910
One day I'll just let you die!

143
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:11,310
Emma... stop it now.

144
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,750
Emma, darling...

145
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,620
My love... Emma...

146
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,990
Hurry up!

147
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,630
Did you bring that woman
that poisoned herself?

148
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:50,550
Giannelli,
don't write anything, please.

149
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,750
I'll get involved with the police.

150
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:55,710
What happened?
What is her name?

151
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,670
I can't tell you.
Leave me alone.

152
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,830
- You can come in.
- Thanks.

153
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:16,270
- Emma!
- Don't tire her. She must rest.

154
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,260
In two hours
you can take her back home.

155
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,230
Go to the brigadier for the report.
It's obligatory.

156
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,270
Emma!

157
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:39,550
Emma, why did you do it? Why?

158
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,590
The brigadier is waiting for you.

159
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,990
I'll be right back.

160
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,430
Wait, he'll be right in.

161
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:28,150
- Sister, can I use the phone?
- Sure.

162
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:22,790
- You can't stay here!
- I just want to take a picture!

163
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,430
Take your glasses off.

164
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:47,590
The producer Toto Scalise
has just arrived.

165
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:51,870
He's signed up the star
for a great picture.

166
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,950
Is it the Swedish woman?

167
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:57,030
I'd better not see her,
otherwise I'll kill my wife!

168
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,230
Long live Sweden!

169
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:06,470
The beautiful Swedish actress
tastes a typical Italian product,

170
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:11,580
which is as colourful
and joyful as our country.

171
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:14,710
Hi, Marcello,
great piece of meat, huh?

172
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:18,750
Toto Scalise is leading the star
through the customs...

173
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:48,790
- Did you have a good trip?
- Yes, thank you.

174
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,830
What a confusion!

175
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,990
- Come on Marcello, pass him!
- Stop it!

176
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:14,030
I want to take a picture!
Pass him!

177
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:25,110
Is it true you always bathe in ice?

178
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:43,230
Which Italian historical figure
would you like to play?

179
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,670
Do you like bearded men?

180
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:53,710
What do you think
about Italian actresses?

181
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:25,190
Do you think Italian Neo-realism
is dead or alive?

182
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:28,230
Do you believe
in friendship among peoples?

183
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:52,830
I couldn't call you before. Thanks.

184
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:01,390
I'm working, dear.
Did you take your medicine?

185
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:06,710
- Are you alone with her?
- There are at least 50 people!

186
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:12,750
- Swear on your mother's life!
- Yes, I swear on my mother.

187
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:17,750
Beautiful
if you like American beauty.

188
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,430
She's like a big doll!

189
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,310
Yes.

190
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:51,070
I'll come there
and rip your eyes out!

191
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:55,110
Marcello, why don't you
come here immediately?

192
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,950
- I can't!
- I want to make love.

193
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,070
- Pardon me?
- I want to make love!

194
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,300
Where shall we take her?

195
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:08,350
First to St. Peter's,
then to the Quirinale.

196
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,190
Here's our Robert!

197
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:29,350
- Marcello?
- What! Are you going out today?

198
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:34,030
No, I'll wait for you
all day at home.

199
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:39,510
What would you like to eat?
Something light. You want ravioli?

200
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:43,980
I've got everything.
I'll just go down for vegetables.

201
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,390
Then we'll go to the movies.
Whatever you want.

202
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,430
Marcello, do you love me?

203
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,790
Don't leave her alone!

204
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:47,190
Wait, I take one more picture!

205
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,190
She never stops a minute!

206
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:09,790
I finished the film.
I'll be right back.

207
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:21,190
- Where did she go?
- She's an elevator!

208
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:10,230
Sylvia, you know you're everything?

209
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:17,670
You're the first woman of creation.

210
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:21,470
You're mother, sister,
lover, friend,

211
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:24,230
an angel, a devil,
the earth, the home.

212
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:27,270
That's what you are: the home!

213
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,190
Why did you come here?

214
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:41,340
Go back to America, please.
What will I do now?

215
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:00,670
Our Robert is even a painter.
Bravo!

216
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:04,710
I must see you!
I must talk to you at all costs!

217
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:27,030
- Who's that idiot?
- Frankie Stout, a divine actor!

218
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,590
Please.

219
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:21,670
- Will you excuse me a moment?
- Go, honey, go!

220
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,310
He's dancing with the lady!

221
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,550
Hi, darling.

222
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:10,820
He's a good dancer, very good!

223
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,710
Banana flambé, huh?

224
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,870
- The lady's shoes.
- I'll take them, thank you.

225
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:20,830
- I found them...
- That's fine, thank you.

226
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:23,590
Excuse me... one moment.

227
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,590
- What do you want?
- Some rock music!

228
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:08,390
Good! Bravo! Divine!

229
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,550
Good!

230
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:21,830
Thank you, madam.
You're divine!

231
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,870
Thank you, sir!

232
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,950
Marcello, open the champagne!

233
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,390
Thanks.

234
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:22,860
I don't know.
I'll bring her back immediately.

235
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,670
Give me the shoes.
I'll be right back.

236
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,350
- Why did she get upset?
- Stay here. I'll take care of it.

237
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:32,000
- Here she is!
- Sylvia! - Sylvia!

238
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:34,460
- Sylvia, the shoes!
- Marcello, what happened?

239
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,510
Nothing happened. Go away!

240
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,670
Marcello, wait!

241
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,350
Great idea, Marcello!

242
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,270
Paparazzo, get out of the car!

243
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:56,790
Incredible scoop.
I'll give you 50 percent.

244
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:01,820
I don't give a damn
about the 50 percent. Get out!

245
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:05,550
Get lost!

246
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:08,830
Marcello,
tell me where you're going!

247
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,870
Hurry. Let's follow them!

248
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,790
We lost them.

249
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,550
Yes... no... of course!

250
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:49,670
What?

251
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:17,830
It's full of holes there!

252
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:37,590
We'd better leave.

253
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:49,790
Sergio will be back on the 12th.
I'm his mother.

254
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:54,470
- Do you have the studio key?
- No, he takes it with him.

255
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:56,790
I'm his mother. Was it for work?

256
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:01,350
Yes, for work...

257
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:04,350
I'll call on the 12th.
It doesn't matter.

258
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:06,390
Excuse me, madam. Goodnight.

259
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:13,870
- Excuse me, isn't she
the American actress? - Yes.

260
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:15,910
- How beautiful!
- Goodnight.

261
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:31,830
I can't bring you home.
The madwoman wouldn't understand.

262
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:33,870
Un-der-stand?

263
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:36,710
Wait. I've got an idea!

264
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:44,110
- Miss, a phone call for you.
- Hello?

265
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:49,670
Marcello! Sure you don't have
the wrong number?

266
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:52,470
Can I come with someone?

267
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:56,390
Someone? Who?

268
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,430
Someone!

269
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:04,190
- You're not alone?
- I'm playing cards with my father.

270
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:09,950
- Your father's there?
- Tell me...

271
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:13,270
What do you want?

272
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:16,550
Nothing.
I'll call you soon. Goodnight.

273
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,950
Sylvia, what are you doing?

274
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:45,230
Where can I find milk
at this hour?

275
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:52,150
Sylvia!
Where are you going with that cat?

276
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:54,990
Come here. Stop!

277
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:58,190
Come on!

278
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:01,820
I'll go get the milk.
Wait in the car.

279
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:06,630
I'm going... go!

280
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:19,700
Excuse me,
where can I buy some milk?

281
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:21,750
It doesn't matter...

282
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:55,430
Yes, I'm coming too...

283
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:59,030
I'm coming too!

284
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:06,550
Yes, you're right.
I'm making a mistake.

285
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:08,590
We're making a mistake!

286
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:23,630
Sylvia, who are you?

287
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:02,870
Turn him...

288
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:08,190
And to think he did Tarzan.

289
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:10,230
Put him back.

290
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:18,790
I'll take this one from the mirror.

291
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:21,830
I'll take one
while you're photographing him.

292
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:25,670
Here's Marcello!

293
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:32,670
Hey, wake up!

294
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:47,430
- Do me a favour. Leave!
- But I've got to work!

295
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:49,470
Enough!

296
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:53,270
Enough!

297
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:03,430
This will end up in a fight!

298
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:31,110
Follow her, Mr. Robert!

299
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:33,670
It's not over yet.

300
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:53,190
Marcello, hit him too, no?

301
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:56,950
Marcello, raise your head a bit!

302
00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:00,630
Mr. Robert, where are you going?
Marcello, what happened?

303
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:08,860
Marcello!
It's done. Now what do I do?

304
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:14,980
Put the horse on the table,
and her on the ground.

305
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:25,830
- I'll be right back. - Are you
coming out with me tonight?

306
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:48,510
I thought I saw you enter. How are
you? What are you doing here?

307
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:52,140
And you?
I'm happy to see you again.

308
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:55,230
I'm at home here.

309
00:52:56,360 --> 00:53:01,220
Father Franz found this book for me.

310
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:03,670
It's an old Sanskrit grammar book.

311
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:09,070
How long! How's your book?

312
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:13,510
It's going.
I finished gathering the material.

313
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:17,030
I thought I'd let you read it.
And you?

314
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:20,070
I liked your recent
article very much.

315
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:25,110
- No.
- Why? It was fine.

316
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:31,590
It was vivid, passionate...
the best of you.

317
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:34,990
A quality you insist on hiding.

318
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:37,870
I don't think I know how to write.

319
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:41,910
Why don't you come
some evening to see me?

320
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:46,590
- Can you stay another
five minutes? - Sure.

321
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:51,270
- Father, can I come up
with a friend? - Yes. Come on!

322
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:54,150
- Are you sure?
- Come on!

323
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:59,670
As you see,
these priests don't fear the devil.

324
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:02,710
They even let me play the organ.

325
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:05,710
Don't be too noisy.

326
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:10,270
Don't worry.
You'll hear some jazz at the most.

327
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:12,710
If It's jazz, I like it.

328
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:17,670
Sorry, I won't do it again.

329
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:20,830
You want to try, Marcello?

330
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:31,070
We're not used to hearing it.
Anymore.

331
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:35,230
Mysterious voice. It seems
to come from inside the earth.

332
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:38,270
- What song?
- You choose?

333
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:55,310
Where is it?
At the end of a wall?

334
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:57,390
Hey, paparazzo!

335
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:00,430
They told me at the 47th kilometre.

336
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:05,990
- I don't want an egg at this hour!
- Eat it.

337
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:08,030
- No!
- Eat it!

338
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:12,190
- Chew slowly!
- Yes.

339
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:17,630
We should have come yesterday.
It'll be full of photographers.

340
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:22,660
- Do you have some coffee?
- Marcello needs it!

341
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:25,750
I don't want a banana!

342
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:28,790
- I don't want it!
- Eat it!

343
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:33,510
- Chew slowly!
- Yes!

344
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:43,990
- The Madonna's children?
- Yes!

345
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:50,340
- Where is the miracle tree?
- Over there!

346
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:10,470
Stay here.
There's too much confusion.

347
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:19,780
Norman! Stay here! Norman!

348
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:26,150
Where are the children?

349
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:28,700
Locked up
in the carabineers' headquarters.

350
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:33,110
Take me with you.
I'll tell you about the Communists.

351
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:37,150
- Where is the miracle tree?
- Over there.

352
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:45,140
Damned them!
Damned them!

353
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:57,070
Free those creatures.
It's an abuse!

354
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:12,350
- Where?
- This way!

355
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:15,000
- Where are the children?
- I don't know.

356
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:18,030
- Where is the marshal?
- Who knows.

357
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:27,430
What about the 500 lira that you
received by that journalist?

358
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:30,910
Can I go home, brigadier?

359
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:37,190
I'll feel shaky
the rest of my life!

360
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:39,230
Yes, I understand...

361
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:44,870
Look over there.

362
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:55,110
The grandfather's here too!

363
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:58,670
- What are the children's names?
- Dario... - Pardon me?

364
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:01,590
- Dario and Maria.
- Dario and Maria. Great!

365
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:03,270
Good, cry!

366
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:07,390
It's a miracle.
The Madonna remembers everyone!

367
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:11,310
- Do I look good like this?
- You're perfect!

368
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:14,350
- The cigar?
- Sing first.

369
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:21,150
- Then It's not a miracle?
- I don't believe it.

370
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:27,190
The Lord can do it anywhere,
but they are very rare events.

371
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:30,630
Those youngsters aren't honest.

372
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:35,840
Who sees the Madonna
doesn't speculate on her!

373
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:41,710
Miracles are born out of silence
not in this confusion!

374
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:47,360
- Who did you see next to the tree?
- The Madonna.

375
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:50,270
- Who saw her first?
- I did! - I did!

376
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:55,350
- Simultaneously!
- No, he saw her first!

377
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:57,390
They are my nephews.

378
00:59:57,480 --> 01:00:02,550
The Madonna looked at us and smiled.
Her feet didn't touch the ground.

379
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:05,670
Did she tell you
she was the Madonna?

380
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:08,790
They don't want to believe it!

381
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:11,180
Could it really
have been the Madonna?

382
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:13,230
It doesn't matter.

383
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:17,550
What do you mean?
Why do you say that?

384
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:19,630
Yes, it doesn't matter.

385
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:24,840
Your Italy is filled
with supernatural forces.

386
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:27,630
Everyone feels their influence.

387
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:30,750
He who looks for God,
finds him where he wants.

388
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:32,990
Did you come for a miracle too?

389
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:37,630
No, I'm with my fiancée.
He's a journalist.

390
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:43,550
All these people frighten me.

391
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:48,590
You stay here. And don't laugh!

392
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:52,030
Higher!

393
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:55,590
I made a mistake.
Get down!

394
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:57,980
Let's try the children's scene!

395
01:00:58,080 --> 01:01:03,150
The children are smaller.
Can you see me?

396
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:05,510
Come on! Hurry up!

397
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:08,390
Hurry up!

398
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:13,470
- Here's my fiancée.
- Fine. - I'll be right back.

399
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:16,590
Ready? Go!

400
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:21,630
Speak up!
Why don't you pray?

401
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:29,620
It's7 p.m.
We'll meet in 2 hours.

402
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:33,470
Thank you.
See you this evening.

403
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:51,190
Holy Madonna,
make this creature get well.

404
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:54,230
I ask you with all my soul!

405
01:02:00,360 --> 01:02:02,310
Marcello...

406
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:10,710
Don't worry.
The Madonna hears us. She's good!

407
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:48,390
A large crowd
has gathered in this area.

408
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:51,310
Many are believers,
many are curious.

409
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:54,790
Among the curious,
journalists, photo reporters

410
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:58,150
from papers all over the world.

411
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:01,310
There is an innumerable number
of cars piled up.

412
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:06,070
The weather is nice
after so much rain.

413
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:09,030
The two children
are still held by the police.

414
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:12,030
We await further word from Rome.

415
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:15,710
We're interviewing
the children's uncle.

416
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:22,140
The first time they saw...
the miracle?

417
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:30,750
They first saw the Madonna
on March 15 of... next year.

418
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:33,910
- You mean this year.
- This year.

419
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:37,230
Permission from Rome arrived.
The children are coming!

420
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:42,310
- Really? - Yes, they are coming.
- The children are coming!

421
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:46,790
- Stay here... I'll be right back.
- Where are you going?

422
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:48,990
- I'm going up there.
- I'm coming too.

423
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:52,830
No, stay here with the lady.

424
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:58,750
Stay here.

425
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:14,870
Marcello, get down!

426
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:17,110
I just came up!

427
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:23,230
I'm coming up too.

428
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:45,140
Marcello,
why did you change so much?

429
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:48,470
Why don't you love me anymore?

430
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:55,950
Holy Madonna, if only he married me,

431
01:04:56,040 --> 01:04:59,820
I'd come here on foot
every day to thank you.

432
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:02,380
I'm not asking you that.

433
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:05,550
I'd like him to be mine
as he was once.

434
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:07,590
Here they are!

435
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:14,180
Here they are!
As soon as they arrive, take shots.

436
01:05:48,080 --> 01:05:50,640
Wait for my sign!

437
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:57,270
Hi, darling, how are you?
Focus on them and then on the crowd.

438
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:08,710
My wife is there too.

439
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:13,590
Sometimes she makes me so upset,
and sometimes...

440
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,950
Calm down... keep calm.

441
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:34,270
One at a time.

442
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:42,670
- It's raining.
- It's dangerous.

443
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:56,630
Water makes lights have short
circuits. Shut everything off!

444
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:17,870
We took shelter in the bus
because it started to rain again.

445
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:35,630
The Madonna is over there!

446
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:54,190
The children are getting up.

447
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:56,550
They're running
in the opposite direction.

448
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:58,830
They cry out
that they see the Madonna.

449
01:07:58,920 --> 01:08:01,150
The wild crowd is following them.

450
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:19,190
They're headed to another area!

451
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:38,590
There she is!

452
01:08:51,160 --> 01:08:55,590
They'll catch pneumonia!

453
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:03,110
She said if you don't build a church
here she won't come anymore.

454
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:08,320
She said if you don't build a church
here she won't come anymore.

455
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:11,430
Good night. Go home!

456
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:22,990
Leave me!

457
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:26,390
- Paparazzo, stop it!
- That's a nice shot!

458
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:31,070
Leave me!
It's impossible to be like you!

459
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:37,500
You're worse than hyenas!
You don't respect anyone! Slimes!

460
01:11:02,240 --> 01:11:04,190
Alfonso!

461
01:11:08,160 --> 01:11:12,310
Alfonso!

462
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:55,510
Good evening, I'm Steiner's wife.
We were waiting for you.

463
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:12,630
Good evening, Marcello.
How are you?

464
01:12:12,720 --> 01:12:15,310
Good. What a lovely home!

465
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:19,870
This is Emma.
I've been wanting to meet you.

466
01:12:19,960 --> 01:12:24,510
- Thanks for coming.
- I'll be right back. - Come here!

467
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:27,470
- Hi, Anna, how are you?
- Did you finish your book?

468
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:30,270
- This is Margherita. You know
her paintings? - Of course.

469
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:33,830
You didn't even come
to my exhibition!

470
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:38,860
She's an admirer of your writings
but she doesn't speak Italian.

471
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:42,310
- She said you're very decorative.
- She's right.

472
01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:47,190
I think I know you well.

473
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:53,670
When you understand that you love
Marcello more than he does...

474
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:55,710
you'll be happy.

475
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:04,510
The only real woman
is the oriental one.

476
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:08,430
Where was Eve?
In the Garden of Eden!

477
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:11,270
Where was the Garden of Eden?
In the orient!

478
01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:15,230
- There is love there!
- Why did you marry me?

479
01:13:15,320 --> 01:13:17,390
I made a big mistake!

480
01:13:17,480 --> 01:13:21,510
Mysterious, motherly,
both lover and daughter.

481
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:27,150
She huddles at your feet
like a tiger in love.

482
01:13:27,240 --> 01:13:30,940
Why doesn't he stay in the Orient?

483
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:33,910
- Will you introduce Emma to me?
- Of course.

484
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:38,470
What a lovely face!
Don't lose hold of that guy!

485
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:42,230
I'm saying it in his interests,
naturally...

486
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:47,340
The Oriental submits
both her spirit and her flesh.

487
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:51,950
May I introduce Marcello
and his fiancée?

488
01:13:52,040 --> 01:13:55,510
I'm pleased to meet you.
I agree with your concept on women.

489
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:59,350
The Oriental woman
can teach us much!

490
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:01,430
She's remained close to nature,

491
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:04,550
the nature she conquered after
centuries of civilization.

492
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:07,910
What use is civilization to you?

493
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:11,470
You can't make love anymore!

494
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:13,910
Speak for yourself!

495
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,150
- Would you like something
to drink? - Yes, please.

496
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:20,830
I envy you:
I've read all your stories.

497
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:26,550
I'd like to travel too,
meet women of all races.

498
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:30,790
I'd like to have children
of all colours: red, yellow...

499
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:34,390
- Like a bouquet of country flowers.
- You can't say anything else!

500
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:36,750
You must have incredible memories.

501
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:42,150
Memories?
Above all, I have projects!

502
01:14:42,240 --> 01:14:46,020
- What a magnificent creature!
Are you his fiancée? - Yes.

503
01:14:46,120 --> 01:14:48,110
Are you from the South?

504
01:14:48,200 --> 01:14:50,150
What an extraordinary person!

505
01:14:50,240 --> 01:14:52,800
He's written many important books

506
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:55,510
and has maintained
a childish candour.

507
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:59,510
I wonder
where he finds so much optimism.

508
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:02,630
I always watch him with stupor.

509
01:15:02,720 --> 01:15:05,590
At times maybe I envy him.

510
01:15:05,680 --> 01:15:09,950
I see that you have
a beautiful Morandi.

511
01:15:10,040 --> 01:15:12,270
Yes, he's my favourite painter.

512
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:15,230
The objects are flooded with light

513
01:15:15,320 --> 01:15:19,990
and yet painted with detachment,
precision, rigour...

514
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:24,910
It's an art
where nothing is coincidental.

515
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:28,350
Steiner said
that you have two loves,

516
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:30,820
and you don't know
which one to choose.

517
01:15:30,920 --> 01:15:35,270
Journalism or literature.
Look out for prisons!

518
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:38,190
Stay free, available, like me.

519
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:43,110
Never get married. Never choose.

520
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:46,150
Even in love,
It's better to be chosen.

521
01:15:49,720 --> 01:15:54,840
I read your poetry. I like it.
It's strong, precise.

522
01:15:54,920 --> 01:15:56,910
It doesn't look like
a woman's writing.

523
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,350
What do you know about women?

524
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:03,780
It's the art I prefer.

525
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:10,110
A clear, crystal art
that doesn't lie and tempt.

526
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:15,030
I work at a job I don't like now,
but I'm thinking about tomorrow.

527
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:18,790
Let's not forget to live today!

528
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:25,030
I think if a person lives
intensively in fullness of spirit

529
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:29,670
he gets younger every year!

530
01:16:35,320 --> 01:16:40,260
- You're a prophet tonight!
- An alcoholic prophet!

531
01:16:41,880 --> 01:16:44,670
Friends, you think too much
about the future.

532
01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:48,750
But you seem so different.
What do you do?

533
01:16:48,840 --> 01:16:52,190
What do you like to do most?

534
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:56,080
I don't know. And you?

535
01:16:56,160 --> 01:17:02,670
I like the three big evasions:
drinking, smoking, and going to bed.

536
01:17:02,760 --> 01:17:07,700
- Such wisdom!
- You never understood me.

537
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:12,710
You are a true primitive,
as primitive as a gothic spire.

538
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:17,510
You're so tall you can't hear
any voices up there!

539
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:22,070
If you could see my real height...
I'm not taller than this.

540
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:34,230
<i>As primitive as a gothic spire. </i>

541
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:39,070
<i>You're so tall you can't hear</i>
<i>any voices up there! </i>

542
01:17:39,160 --> 01:17:43,710
<i>If you could see my real height... </i>
<i>I'm not taller than this. </i>

543
01:17:49,320 --> 01:17:52,710
It's an old recording.
I'll shut it off.

544
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:56,030
Why, can't we hear it?

545
01:17:56,120 --> 01:17:58,990
I don't want to bore you.

546
01:17:59,080 --> 01:18:01,640
They're nature sounds he's recorded.

547
01:18:01,720 --> 01:18:05,340
- Play them again, please.
- No. - Please.

548
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:08,000
If they don't interest you,
why did you record them?

549
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:11,910
I thought they were beautiful.
Do you really want to hear them?

550
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:15,950
- I already know how interesting
they are. - As you wish.

551
01:18:41,360 --> 01:18:43,310
Birds!

552
01:18:45,680 --> 01:18:47,630
That's exactly the way they sound.

553
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:56,510
This is a forest.

554
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:09,350
What are you doing here?

555
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:16,150
- Why did you get out of bed?
- You'll get a cold!

556
01:19:16,240 --> 01:19:18,590
Your storm woke him up.

557
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:25,710
- Did you want one more kiss?
- Dad, you've got a huge head!

558
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:31,710
A huge head?!
Everyone knows now!

559
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:33,750
Such lovely children!

560
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:38,420
- Such intelligent eyes!
- Yes, It's true.

561
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:40,820
When one says something
that catches his interest

562
01:19:40,920 --> 01:19:45,470
first he thinks about it, seriously,
then he laughs cheerfully.

563
01:19:47,160 --> 01:19:50,780
If you give him a flower,
first he looks at it,

564
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:54,030
then laughs because he understands
that It's beautiful.

565
01:19:54,120 --> 01:19:57,900
The way you smile
when you listen to music.

566
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:03,190
Now back to sleep!
Then I'll come say goodnight.

567
01:20:03,280 --> 01:20:06,820
- Say goodnight to everyone.
- Goodnight.

568
01:20:06,920 --> 01:20:12,630
The girl is different.
She likes combinations of words.

569
01:20:12,720 --> 01:20:14,910
A new phrase enchants her.

570
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:18,910
At times she invents them.
I noted some of them.

571
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:23,190
For example:
"Who is the sun's mother?".

572
01:20:23,230 --> 01:20:26,820
Beautiful,
It's like a poet's phrase.

573
01:20:28,630 --> 01:20:33,300
- Do they sleep with you?
- They'd like to.

574
01:20:33,390 --> 01:20:40,420
At times
the little one slips into our bed.

575
01:20:40,510 --> 01:20:43,860
He takes her mother's finger
and squeezes it.

576
01:20:44,310 --> 01:20:46,300
You can't imagine how sweet it is

577
01:20:46,390 --> 01:20:50,340
to fall asleep
with a child next to you.

578
01:21:01,390 --> 01:21:04,140
Have you known Steiner
for a long time?

579
01:21:04,230 --> 01:21:08,380
Yes, but we've not seen
each other often.

580
01:21:29,190 --> 01:21:33,740
One day you'll have
a house like this.

581
01:21:42,070 --> 01:21:45,820
We get on well together, don't we?

582
01:22:11,590 --> 01:22:16,710
- Let me come here more often.
- Anytime.

583
01:22:16,790 --> 01:22:18,940
What is it, Marcello?

584
01:22:19,550 --> 01:22:23,060
I should change environment,
many things.

585
01:22:25,590 --> 01:22:27,540
Your house is a refuge.

586
01:22:27,630 --> 01:22:31,820
Your wife, the children, your books,
your extraordinary friends...

587
01:22:31,910 --> 01:22:34,980
I'm wasting time.
I won't manage anything anymore.

588
01:22:35,070 --> 01:22:40,660
Once I had ambitions...
but maybe I'm losing everything.

589
01:22:41,630 --> 01:22:45,580
Safety is not being locked up
in one's home.

590
01:22:46,830 --> 01:22:52,780
I'm too serious to be a dabbler
but not enough to be a professional.

591
01:22:53,670 --> 01:22:57,060
A more miserable life
is better, believe me,

592
01:22:57,150 --> 01:23:04,860
than an existence protected
by a perfectly organized society.

593
01:23:07,110 --> 01:23:11,260
I'm your friend
but I can't give you any advice.

594
01:23:12,230 --> 01:23:20,580
I can have you meet an editor
who can give you a decent job.

595
01:23:21,710 --> 01:23:24,660
It's better
than writing for those papers...

596
01:23:25,550 --> 01:23:30,490
- Do you want to think about it?
We'll discuss it later. - Yes.

597
01:23:36,430 --> 01:23:38,380
Come...
