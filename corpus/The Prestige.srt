1
00:00:58,425 --> 00:00:59,758
Are you watching closely?

2
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:11,153
Every magic trick
consists of three parts or acts.

3
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:14,698
The first part is called the Pledge.

4
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:18,118
The magician shows you
something ordinary...

5
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:21,622
...a deck of cards, a bird, or a man.

6
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:30,672
He shows you this object...

7
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,841
...perhaps he asks you to inspect it...

8
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:36,637
...to see that it is, indeed, real.

9
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:39,932
Yeah, unaltered, normal.

10
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:46,146
But of course, it probably isn't.

11
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:50,400
- Where do you think you're going?
- I'm part of the bloody act, you fool.

12
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:05,833
The second act is called the Turn.

13
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:23,267
The magician takes
the ordinary something...

14
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:28,063
...and makes it
do something extraordinary.

15
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:36,446
Now, you're looking for the secret,
but you won't find it...

16
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:39,908
...because, of course,
you're not really looking.

17
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:42,202
You don't really wanna know.

18
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:47,791
You want to be fooled.

19
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,420
But you wouldn't clap yet...

20
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:56,216
...because making something disappear
isn't enough.

21
00:02:56,801 --> 00:03:00,137
You have to bring it back.

22
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:05,142
That's why every magic trick
has a third act.

23
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,894
The hardest part.

24
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:10,898
The part we call the Prestige.

25
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:25,787
The Prestige. And did Robert Angier,
the Great Danton, your employer...

26
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:28,624
...get to that final part
of his trick that night?

27
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:31,585
- No, sir. Something went wrong.
- What went wrong?

28
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:35,255
I saw someone
making their way below stage.

29
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:37,132
I followed him.

30
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,552
It was Borden,
watching Mr. Angier drown.

31
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,972
Would you please describe
your occupation to the jury, Mr. Cutter?

32
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,224
I'm an ingénieur.

33
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:49,770
I design illusions and construct the
apparatus necessary for performing them.

34
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:50,938
So, Mr. Cutter...

35
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:54,274
...was this water-filled tank
beneath the stage...

36
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:56,193
...part of Mr. Angier's illusion?

37
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:57,486
No, no. It was...

38
00:03:57,654 --> 00:04:01,823
The tank was brought on for the first trick
and then taken off-stage.

39
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:05,160
Borden must have placed it
under the trap door after the interval.

40
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:06,745
How large was this tank?

41
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:11,500
Oh, it's a normal tank for escape
underwater, about 4 or 500 gallons.

42
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:13,043
How do you think Mr. Borden...

43
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:16,672
...was able to move the tank under
the trap door without anyone noticing?

44
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,632
He's a magician. Ask him.

45
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:23,345
I ask again that this man explain
the mechanics of Mr. Angier's illusion.

46
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:25,013
The Real Transported Man...

47
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:28,183
...is one of the most sought-after illusions
in this business.

48
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:29,851
I have the right to sell it on.

49
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:32,604
If I reveal the method here,
then the trick is worthless.

50
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:36,817
How can we know that the tank wasn't
some part of the trick that went wrong?

51
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,653
Mr. Cutter, I see your predicament...

52
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:42,072
...but Alfred Borden's life
hangs in the balance.

53
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:45,367
If you were prepared to disclose
the details to me in private...

54
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:48,120
...I might be able to judge
their relevance to the case.

55
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,872
Might this be an acceptable compromise?

56
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:12,477
I'm gonna have to ask you
to turn out your pockets.

57
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:18,066
Not my idea, sir.

58
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:22,237
The warden saw his show in Manchester
last year where he vanished into thin air.

59
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:25,365
He's convinced he'll try and escape.

60
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:31,038
I told him the only way
that Borden's gonna disappear...

61
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:34,374
...is if I leave him out there
with the other inmates.

62
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:40,714
Check the locks.

63
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,551
Twice.

64
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,602
My name is Owens.

65
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,937
I'm a solicitor.

66
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:59,775
I represent Lord Caldlow, an accomplished
amateur magician and historian...

67
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:01,651
How much?

68
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,821
- Lord Caldlow is interested...
- How much for my tricks?

69
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:06,281
Five thousand pounds.

70
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:08,950
Talk with Fallon, my ingénieur.
Money's for him.

71
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:12,788
Yes, I did.
He offered to sell me your tricks.

72
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:15,665
All except the most valuable one:
The Transported Man.

73
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:19,002
Well, I wouldn't forgive myself
for selling my greatest trick.

74
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,462
Even for your daughter?

75
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:24,841
If the newspapers are right
and you are for the drop...

76
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:28,387
...your daughter will need looking after.
- Fallon will take care of her.

77
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:31,973
Bernard Fallon? A man with a past
almost as obscure as your own.

78
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:34,768
Courts motioned that the girl
be removed from his care.

79
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:37,354
No, the girl will be an orphan.

80
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:42,401
I know you're no stranger to the workhouse.
It's better than here?

81
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:45,612
I'm offering you a way
to wrap up your affairs with dignity.

82
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,656
And I'm offering your daughter a future.

83
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:51,451
As Lord Caldlow's ward,
she will want for nothing. Ever.

84
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:55,539
Well, think it over.

85
00:06:56,332 --> 00:07:00,669
And Lord Caldlow would like you
to have this as a show of good faith.

86
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:04,214
He said it might be of interest.
This is Robert Angier's diary.

87
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:07,175
Including the time he spent
in Colorado learning your trick.

88
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:08,844
- He never learned my trick.
- Really?

89
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:12,514
On his return from Colorado, he mounted
a version of The Transported Man...

90
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:16,518
...that the papers said
was better even than your original.

91
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:23,066
If you want Angier's secrets,
you go dig him up and ask him yourself.

92
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:26,194
I want your secret, Mr. Borden.

93
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:29,698
Consider your daughter.

94
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:41,251
A cipher. An enigma.

95
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:47,799
A search. A search for answers.

96
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:57,517
EVen if Colorado
is the end of my journey...

97
00:07:57,685 --> 00:08:03,398
...it'll take much longer to unravel
the rest of Borden's secrets.

98
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:09,571
See, the cipher in his notebook
is unlocked by a single word...

99
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:15,535
...but it will still take months to translate
his writing and to know his mind.

100
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:21,708
Well, my passion is equal to the task.

101
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:37,557
Mr. Angier?
Welcome to Colorado Springs.

102
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:56,159
- The whole town has electricity.
- Yes, sir.

103
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:15,887
Well, quite a reception.

104
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:18,431
You're our first guest of the season,
Mr. Angier.

105
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:21,977
Your telegram didn't indicate
how long you'll be staying with us.

106
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:23,645
For as long as it takes.

107
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:26,982
I'll need a coach tomorrow
to take me up the mountain.

108
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:30,694
Well, the peak is closed, sir,
for scientific experimentation.

109
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:34,114
Yes, I know. That's why I'm here.

110
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:48,712
You'll have to walk the rest,
I'm afraid, sir.

111
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:29,586
I'm amazed how many of you
newspaper writers can't read my sign.

112
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:36,509
Not the welcome I was expecting.

113
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:41,514
I know you.

114
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:50,065
You're the Great Danton.
I saw your show in London seven times.

115
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:54,527
You guessed every object
the audience had in their pockets.

116
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:56,071
I'm Alley.

117
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:58,698
Sorry about the fence.
People interfere with our work.

118
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:01,409
- I've come to see Tesla.
- Why?

119
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:05,413
He made a machine
for a colleague of mine sometime ago.

120
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:09,084
- Can you get me a meeting with him?
- Impossible, I'm afraid.

121
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:11,419
I brought a lot of money.

122
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:13,129
I'm sorry, Mr. Angier.

123
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:17,175
I simply can't help you.

124
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:21,638
I'll be staying at the hotel. Indefinitely.

125
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:25,725
Hey, what am I holding?

126
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:27,894
Your watch.

127
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:38,405
Borden's journal entry for April 3rd, 1897,
describes a show at the Orpheum Theater.

128
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:42,409
That was just days after he first met me.

129
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:47,455
We were two young men
at the start of a great career.

130
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:50,125
Two young men devoted to an illusion.

131
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:52,460
Two young men
who never intended to hurt anyone.

132
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:57,132
Which of you brave souls is willing
to bind this lovely young woman?

133
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:10,812
If you would tie her wrists.

134
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:16,443
Bind her feet around the ankle.

135
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,611
Are either of you two gentlemen sailors?

136
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:20,488
- No.
- No.

137
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:24,784
I'm sure you can both tie a strong knot.

138
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:31,142
He's complacent,
he's predictable, he's boring.

139
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,895
I mean, Milton has gotten success,
whatever that means...

140
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:36,856
...and now he's scared.
He won't take any risks at all.

141
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:39,734
I mean, he's squandering
the goodwill of the audience...

142
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:42,862
...with tired, second-rate tricks.
- They're old favorites.

143
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:46,407
Favorites? Give me something fresh.
He won't even try a bullet catch.

144
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:48,159
A bullet catch is suicide.

145
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:52,247
All it takes is some smart-ass volunteer
to put a button in the barrel.

146
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:54,749
- Fine. Use a plant.
- You can't for every trick.

147
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:57,752
- There'd be no seats left for the punters.
- No bullet catch.

148
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:02,257
Whatever. The point is that a real magician
tries to invent something new...

149
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:05,218
...that other magicians
are gonna scratch their heads over.

150
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:07,554
And then you sell it to him
for a small fortune.

151
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:08,721
- All right.
- Yeah.

152
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:10,723
I suppose you have such a trick.

153
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:13,309
- Actually, I do.
- Would you care to sell it to me?

154
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:15,019
No.
No one else could do my trick.

155
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:17,230
- Any trick can be duplicated, right?
- Wrong.

156
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:20,275
If Mr. Borden
has invented his masterpiece...

157
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:22,610
...it might be only he's prepared to do it.

158
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:25,154
Milton is a great showman,
but Borden is right.

159
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:26,906
He won't get his hands dirty.

160
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:31,452
If you wanna see what it takes
to make real magic, go to the Tenley.

161
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:34,330
There's a Chinaman there,
and he really has what it takes.

162
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:36,749
- Chung Ling Soo.
- Pricey. I can't afford that.

163
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:38,459
I know the bloke on the door.

164
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:40,962
You two go and see that show...

165
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,006
...and whichever one of you
can tell me...

166
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:45,049
...how he does
the goldfish-bowl trick...

167
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:46,509
...gets a prize.
- All right.

168
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:48,344
- Which is?
- Ten minutes on-stage...

169
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:50,305
...with my old friend Mr. Ackerman.

170
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:51,806
- Really?
- Who's Ackerman?

171
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:54,100
The top theatrical agent in London.

172
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,186
I saw you drop the knot again.

173
00:14:57,354 --> 00:15:00,690
- I think I turned my wrist.
- Some nights, you just don't get it, do you?

174
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:04,819
I mean, if that knot slips
and Julia's on the hoist, she'll break a leg.

175
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:09,324
It's the wrong knot. Like I said,
the Langford double will hold tighter.

176
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:13,119
The Langford double isn't a wet knot.
It's too dangerous.

177
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:15,371
If the rope swells up, she won't slip it.

178
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:18,666
- I can slip a Langford underwater.
- She can slip it. We'll practice.

179
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:20,168
Hey, Borden, he said no.

180
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,670
Yeah, well, you know knots
better than me, do you?

181
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:24,756
Listen, no more mistakes.

182
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:27,508
All right. Yeah, do you?
You wanna take over?

183
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:30,511
- Just leave it.
- I didn't think so.

184
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:37,560
- Hey, Cutter, where's he from?
- Where are you from?

185
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:42,023
- He shifts props for Virgil at the hall.
- Aren't you worried he'll steal your tricks?

186
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:44,484
- He doesn't deal in methods.
- How do you know?

187
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:49,739
Because I hired him to find out
how Virgil does the orange trick.

188
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:52,241
- Well, I don't trust him.
- He's a natural magician.

189
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:53,868
Of course you can't trust him.

190
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:55,745
I think he's all right.

191
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:58,247
- You think everyone's all right.
- Even you.

192
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:02,126
Watch your sightlines. If I can see you
kissing your wife's leg every night...

193
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:04,837
...so can the blokes
at the ends of row three and four.

194
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:39,414
- You're wrong. It can't be.
- No, it is.

195
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:43,042
- Look at the man.
- This is the trick.

196
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:47,755
This is a performance right here.
This is why no one can detect his method.

197
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:51,092
Total devotion to his art.

198
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:56,264
Utter self-sacrifice, you know?

199
00:16:56,432 --> 00:17:02,061
It's the only way to escape all this,
you know.

200
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:05,231
All right.

201
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:09,318
I can barely lift this thing
and it's not even filled with water.

202
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:12,989
Or fish. Look.

203
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:15,283
I don't know. Hang on a second.

204
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:20,413
He must be strong as an ox.

205
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,501
He's been pretending
to be a cripple for years.

206
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:29,130
Any time he's in public. Any time
he goes out. It's unthinkable.

207
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:32,258
Borden saw it at once,
but I couldn't fathom it.

208
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:35,011
Living my whole life
pretending to be someone else.

209
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:38,848
- You're pretending to be someone else.
- I don't think changing a name compares.

210
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:41,476
Not just your name.
Who you are and where you're from.

211
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:45,897
I promised my family I wouldn't embarrass
them with my theatrical endeavors.

212
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:49,317
I thought of a name for you.

213
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,695
The Great Danton.

214
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:55,323
Do you like it?

215
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:58,659
- But it's sophisticated.
- It's French.

216
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:08,836
Borden writes as if no one but he
understood the true nature of magic.

217
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:17,512
But what does he know of self-sacrifice?

218
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:24,519
You bloody fool.

219
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:54,507
- He killed it.
- What?

220
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:55,675
What's wrong?

221
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:59,887
- He killed it.
- I'm sure he didn't.

222
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:05,309
See? Look, now
he'll bring it back.

223
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:10,398
No, he killed it.

224
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:12,733
No.

225
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:21,742
Look. See?
He's all right. He's fine.

226
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:25,913
- Look at him.
- But where's his brother?

227
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:31,836
He's a sharp lad, your son.

228
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:34,589
Oh, he's my nephew.

229
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:41,888
You're the lucky one today.

230
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:04,785
Are you watching closely?

231
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,957
Look closer.

232
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,795
Never show anyone.

233
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:19,592
They'll beg you and they'll flatter you for
the secret, but as soon as you give it up...

234
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,219
...you'll be nothing to them.

235
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:23,596
You understand? Nothing.

236
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:26,641
The secret impresses no one.

237
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:30,311
The trick you use it for is everything.

238
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:39,111
- Well, thank you for lunch, Mr. Borden.
- You're welcome.

239
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:43,824
- Alfred. It's Alfred.
- Alfred.

240
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:46,827
So I could use a cup of tea.

241
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:51,332
I'd scandalize the landlord. I think not.

242
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,961
You think that's...?
Is that enough to keep me out?

243
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:58,339
I think so.

244
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:01,133
So I'll see you again?

245
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:11,769
Milk and sugar?

246
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:37,837
- What's in there?
- Angier's machine.

247
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:47,972
You built this, Mr. Cutter?

248
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,933
Oh, no, sir.
This wasn't built by a magician.

249
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:53,060
This was built by a wizard.

250
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:57,857
A man who can actually do
what magicians pretend to do.

251
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:02,403
Tell me, Your Honor, what happens
with these things after the trial?

252
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:04,280
They've been sold to a Lord Caldlow.

253
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:07,241
An avid collector,
apparently very interested in the case.

254
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:09,869
Yeah, well, don't let him take this.

255
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:11,787
- Why ever not?
- It's too dangerous.

256
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:17,376
I'm sure beneath its bells and whistles
it's got a simple and disappointing trick.

257
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:20,421
Most disappointing of all, sir...

258
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:23,966
...it has no trick.

259
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:27,720
It's real.

260
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:33,100
This is the tank Angier drowned in?

261
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:35,269
Yes.

262
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:41,776
This is the place where the performer's
hand reaches through to the trick padlock.

263
00:22:41,943 --> 00:22:44,278
A standard magical apparatus
for escapes.

264
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:46,822
Yeah, with one important difference:

265
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,908
This isn't a trick lock.

266
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:50,993
It's been switched for a real one.

267
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:53,079
What a way to kill someone.

268
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:57,083
They're magicians, Your Honor.
Showmen.

269
00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:01,295
Men who live by dressing up plain
and sometimes-brutal truths...

270
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:04,340
...to amaze, to shock.

271
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:06,884
Even without an audience?

272
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:09,804
There was an audience.

273
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,807
You see, this water tank...

274
00:23:12,974 --> 00:23:17,144
...was of particular significance
to these two men.

275
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:21,524
Particularly awful significance.

276
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:27,988
Which of you brave souls is willing
to bind this lovely young woman?

277
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:31,867
If you would tie her wrists.

278
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:34,203
Bind her feet around the ankle.

279
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:49,510
Are either of you two gentlemen sailors?

280
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:50,678
No.

281
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:55,057
I'm sure you can both tie a strong knot.

282
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:50,571
Robert!

283
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:13,469
No! No! No!

284
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:18,098
Julia. Julia.

285
00:25:18,266 --> 00:25:20,726
Julia! Julia!

286
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:08,190
I knew an old sailor once.

287
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:13,362
He told me he went overboard,
tangled in the sails.

288
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:19,159
They pulled him out,
but it took him five minutes to cough.

289
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:23,289
He said it was like going home.

290
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,879
What do you want, Borden?

291
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:39,722
I'm sorry for your loss, Angier.

292
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:45,894
Which knot did you tie?

293
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:50,316
I keep asking myself that.

294
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:54,528
- And?
- And...

295
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:58,365
I'm sorry, I just don't know.

296
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:01,994
You don't know?

297
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:05,497
I'm sorry.

298
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:15,049
You don't know?

299
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:22,681
Alfred?

300
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:25,059
Good news.
We got our first booking today.

301
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:28,270
- I don't think we've had the pleasure.
- Mr. Fallon is my ingénieur.

302
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:31,899
- Where did you get all of...?
- Begged, borrowed, and don't ask.

303
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:36,153
He's a very enterprising soul,
is Mr. Fallon.

304
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:37,863
- So...
- We can't afford to pay him.

305
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:39,782
Money will come
when we get the audience.

306
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:43,410
But what about until then? I mean,
what I earn, it's barely enough for us.

307
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:46,747
Don't worry about it. I'll share
half my food with him or something.

308
00:27:47,707 --> 00:27:50,542
You're already going to be doing that
with someone else.

309
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:54,797
- No. You're...?
- Having a baby.

310
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:58,759
Oh, my God. We should have told Fallon.

311
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:00,719
That is great. We're having a baby.

312
00:28:00,887 --> 00:28:02,930
- We're having a baby.
- Oh, come here.

313
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:07,893
Alfred, what's this?

314
00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:12,106
Oh, this is just the trick to wake
Ackerman up at the end of my act.

315
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:14,900
Is it the masterpiece? The great trick?

316
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:17,611
No, no, no. The world is not ready
for that one yet.

317
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:22,116
This is just your run-of-the-mill,
daring, spectacular bullet catch.

318
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:27,079
- A bullet catch?
- Yeah, but it's safe, I promise. Look.

319
00:28:29,582 --> 00:28:31,750
- Shoot me.
- Shoot you?

320
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:32,960
Go on, shoot me.

321
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:37,589
- Right there.
- No, I can't.

322
00:28:37,757 --> 00:28:40,634
No, no, not there. Shoot me here. Don't...

323
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:48,976
- How's that?
- That's very good.

324
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:51,812
- Go on, tell me how you do it.
- No, I can't do that.

325
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:56,900
- Well, then you can't do it. Alfred...
- I can't do it?

326
00:28:57,068 --> 00:29:00,279
I'm sorry, Alfred,
but I can't raise a child on my own.

327
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:04,158
- You don't tell anybody that I told you.
- Okay.

328
00:29:04,325 --> 00:29:06,034
Gunpowder...

329
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:08,704
...wadding...

330
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:12,207
...and a bullet.

331
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:14,626
A ramrod.

332
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:20,549
Hold out your hand.

333
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:27,514
The bullet is not even in the gun
when the charge is fired.

334
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:31,351
Once you know,
it's actually very obvious.

335
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,396
Well, I mean, you still get...

336
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:37,524
It's dangerous. I mean,
people still get killed doing that.

337
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:38,901
- Well, how?
- Well, you know.

338
00:29:39,068 --> 00:29:42,029
Somebody could get a smart-ass.
He can put a penny or a button...

339
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:45,157
...or may God forbid, Sarah,
somebody could put a bullet there.

340
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:47,743
Don't worry. Don't worry...

341
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:51,205
...because I'm not gonna let
anything happen.

342
00:29:51,372 --> 00:29:52,956
Everything's gonna be all right...

343
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:59,296
...because I love you very much.

344
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:04,718
- Say it again.
- I love you.

345
00:30:05,845 --> 00:30:08,222
- Not today.
- What?

346
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:11,517
Well, on some days it's not true,
and today you don't mean it.

347
00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:14,770
Maybe today you're more
in love with magic than me.

348
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:17,272
I like being able to tell the difference.

349
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:22,361
It makes the days it is true
mean something.

350
00:30:24,572 --> 00:30:26,114
All right.

351
00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:48,095
Metal rings, ladies and gentlemen.

352
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:51,056
If there are any
ladies or gentlemen here.

353
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:54,393
- Solid metal.
- Seen that already.

354
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:57,437
- Leave it out!
- Come on.

355
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:04,319
Get out your gun, mate.

356
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:07,072
- Who threw that?
- I did!

357
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:15,664
Get out your gun.
You're gonna need it.

358
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:21,128
Get a gun.

359
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:25,007
It's what you came for, is it?

360
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:32,472
So who wants to volunteer?

361
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:35,475
Me! Me!

362
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:46,820
Me.

363
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:49,364
Watch it, cowboy.

364
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:03,128
Are you man enough, sir?

365
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:09,801
Yes.

366
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:31,239
Which knot did you tie, Borden?

367
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:34,159
I don't know.

368
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:53,387
He came in to demand an answer,
and I told him the truth.

369
00:32:53,554 --> 00:32:56,556
That I have fought with myself
over that night.

370
00:32:56,724 --> 00:33:00,185
One half of me swearing blind
that I tied a simple slipknot...

371
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:03,563
...the other half conVinced
that I tied the Langford double.

372
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:05,941
I can never know for sure.

373
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:13,240
How can he not know?

374
00:33:14,283 --> 00:33:18,203
He must know what he did. He must.

375
00:33:20,915 --> 00:33:22,874
Sarah, that bloody hurts.

376
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:26,211
I don't understand
how it can be bleeding again.

377
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:28,714
It's as bad as the day it happened.

378
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:35,762
- We have to get a doctor back.
- We can't afford the bloody doctor back.

379
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:38,682
- You've woken her.
- Great.

380
00:33:39,642 --> 00:33:42,269
I'm sorry. I need this to heal
so I can go back to work.

381
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:46,148
Alfred, face things. What tricks
can you perform with this kind of injury?

382
00:33:46,315 --> 00:33:49,818
I can do card pulls.
I can do some prop tricks.

383
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:54,281
I can still do that. And I can do the trick
that I've been telling you about.

384
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:56,450
The one that they're gonna
remember me for.

385
00:33:58,953 --> 00:34:00,746
Come on.

386
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:29,274
Never thought I'd find an answer
at the bottom of a glass.

387
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:30,984
Hasn't stopped you looking.

388
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:37,449
Heard about a booking.

389
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:41,244
Nice little theater.
Young up-and-coming magician.

390
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:42,829
- Who?
- You.

391
00:34:42,997 --> 00:34:44,664
You got me a booking? Why?

392
00:34:44,832 --> 00:34:46,750
I wanna keep on working.

393
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:49,961
And who's gonna hire the ingénieur
that killed Julia McCullough...

394
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:52,339
...in front of a sellout crowd
at the Orpheum?

395
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:55,342
Someone who knows
it wasn't your fault.

396
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:58,887
Someone who knows Alfred Borden
and his repertoire of exotic knots.

397
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:02,516
I hear he had a spot of bad luck
catching a bullet south of the river.

398
00:35:02,683 --> 00:35:05,102
That's a dangerous trick, that one.

399
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:12,567
We'll have to whitewash the windows...

400
00:35:12,735 --> 00:35:17,155
...confound the more curious members
of the public, but it will do.

401
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:21,701
- We should see about an assistant.
- I've made some arrangements.

402
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:25,288
Have you settled on a name?

403
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:28,875
Yes, I have. The Great Danton.

404
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:31,545
It's a bit old-fashioned, isn't it?

405
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:35,215
No, it's sophisticated.

406
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:37,801
The birdcage can't be our climax.
Everybody knows it.

407
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:40,512
- Not like this they don't.
- I don't wanna kill doves.

408
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:44,224
Then stay off the stage.
You're a magician, not a wizard.

409
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:48,228
You gotta get your hands dirty
if you're gonna achieve the impossible.

410
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:52,023
In here, Miss Wenscombe.

411
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:55,569
No point in you meeting Mr. Angier
if you don't fit.

412
00:35:55,736 --> 00:35:57,696
On the right.

413
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:00,949
What's so hard about this?

414
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:04,369
Nothing. But you're going down here.

415
00:36:06,622 --> 00:36:10,083
Hold it. Hold it there.
This has gotta go around there.

416
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:12,335
- And this will conceal it?
- Yeah, oh, sure.

417
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:13,587
- All right?
- Yeah.

418
00:36:13,754 --> 00:36:16,381
- Now, take that one there.
- Yep. Okay.

419
00:36:16,549 --> 00:36:19,009
- Pin this under.
- And this ties up here?

420
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:20,969
- That ties at the front.
- That's good.

421
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:29,936
Breathe as little as possible.

422
00:36:35,651 --> 00:36:38,445
Now, you see? That'll go. That'll flatten.

423
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:39,905
- I see. Yeah.
- Okay.

424
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:47,287
She's not experienced,
but she knows how to present herself.

425
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:51,708
A pretty assistant is the most
effective form of misdirection.

426
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:53,251
Thank you.

427
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:55,420
Ladies and gentlemen,
for my final trick...

428
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:58,256
...I will require the assistance
of two volunteers.

429
00:36:58,424 --> 00:37:00,759
Mr. Merrit, if you would oblige me?

430
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:05,722
Yeah. Okay. Bring your hand around.

431
00:37:06,098 --> 00:37:07,474
- Under?
- Under, yeah.

432
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:10,435
There. I put it around its foot.

433
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:12,437
- Careful.
- He's all right, ain't he?

434
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:35,669
- You get a volunteer to put a hand there.
- Yeah.

435
00:37:35,836 --> 00:37:36,878
And another one there.

436
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:40,715
Mr. Merrit, if you'll place your hands
on either side of the cage, please.

437
00:37:40,883 --> 00:37:41,883
Thank you, Olivia.

438
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:43,843
You best not be intending...

439
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:46,513
...to hurt this animal, Mr. Angier.
- Of course not.

440
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:48,890
You ready? All right.

441
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:50,642
One...

442
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:52,310
Two...

443
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,688
- Three.
- Three. Go.

444
00:37:57,817 --> 00:37:59,526
Well, that's bloody marvelous,
Cutter.

445
00:38:00,736 --> 00:38:01,736
Very nice.

446
00:38:01,904 --> 00:38:04,030
And the best part is...

447
00:38:09,328 --> 00:38:11,454
I thought you said
I had to get my hands dirty.

448
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:15,041
Someday perhaps you will.
I just had to know that you can.

449
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:17,919
- Very nice. Very nice, indeed.
- Thank you, Mr. Merrit.

450
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:20,922
I haven't had the chance
to compliment your beautiful theater.

451
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:23,425
Well, it'll be a lot more beautiful
when it's full.

452
00:38:23,592 --> 00:38:25,427
- Don't worry.
- Oh, you all say that.

453
00:38:25,594 --> 00:38:29,389
Why should I worry? If your tricks
don't get them in, somebody else's will.

454
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:33,727
Maybe somebody willing to do
a bullet catch or a water escape?

455
00:38:33,894 --> 00:38:35,270
Cheap thrills, Mr. Merrit.

456
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:39,065
People hoping for an accident,
likely to see one too.

457
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:41,776
What would that do for your business?

458
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:45,196
- You got a week, John.
- Thank you, Mr. Merrit.

459
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:57,584
Thank you.

460
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:02,255
Sir? In the third row there.

461
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:05,258
Please stand up
and show us your handkerchief.

462
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:08,887
This isn't mine.

463
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:12,140
Perhaps you'd be so good as to return it
to the lady in the aisle.

464
00:39:12,308 --> 00:39:13,600
I believe she has yours.

465
00:39:17,229 --> 00:39:18,813
Thank you.

466
00:39:20,983 --> 00:39:23,401
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I'm making so many mistakes.

467
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:25,403
I'm so nervous.

468
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:28,114
The audience doesn't seem
to be responding.

469
00:39:28,282 --> 00:39:33,078
They've seen a lot of tricks before,
but not this next one.

470
00:39:41,837 --> 00:39:44,047
Put a cloth over.

471
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:47,008
- Fingers crossed.
- I'll have the champagne ready.

472
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,318
- You've seen this one before?
- We've seen them all.

473
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:07,904
I'll make it a little harder then, shall I?

474
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:13,493
Two volunteers, please. A lady
and a gentleman to hold this cage with me.

475
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:17,872
I'll perform this feat in a manner
never before seen by yourselves...

476
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:20,875
...or any other audience
anywhere in the world.

477
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:27,590
Madam, if you'll place one hand on the back
of the cage, one hand on the front.

478
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:31,636
Sir, one hand on the bottom of the cage,
one hand on the top.

479
00:40:45,192 --> 00:40:47,819
- Should have spotted him.
- You had a lot of plates going.

480
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:50,238
- Don't suppose they'll let us do this again.
- No.

481
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:54,200
- So, what's the climax of our show?
- Show? You don't have a show.

482
00:40:54,368 --> 00:40:55,994
We have a week's engagement.

483
00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:59,789
To perform magic, not butcher birds
and break my customers' fingers.

484
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:02,375
Clear out. Anything here
in the morning gets burned.

485
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:04,878
- Mr. Merrit...
- It's done, John.

486
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:08,715
I've hired a comedian.
You know I hate comedians.

487
00:41:10,217 --> 00:41:12,385
Well, there's plenty of good theaters.

488
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:16,556
If we can come up with a new trick,
change the name of the act...

489
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:18,600
The name stays.

490
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:25,565
Right. Well, then the new trick's
gonna have to be irresistible, then.

491
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:27,525
I have a couple of methods to try out.

492
00:41:27,693 --> 00:41:30,987
And then we need a new angle
on the presentation.

493
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:32,947
Oh, and if you need some inspiration...

494
00:41:33,115 --> 00:41:36,117
...there's a technical exposition
at the Albert Hall this week.

495
00:41:36,285 --> 00:41:38,953
Engineers, scientists, you know?

496
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:42,290
That sort of thing
captures a public's imagination.

497
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:02,769
Mind if I join you? Tesla sends me
down here during the storms.

498
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:06,064
Perfect excuse to come join
the Great Danton for a drink.

499
00:42:07,274 --> 00:42:09,067
Two of them.

500
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:12,111
Beautiful, isn't it, huh?
God, I miss New York though.

501
00:42:12,279 --> 00:42:14,656
- So why are you here?
- The lightning lives here.

502
00:42:14,823 --> 00:42:17,951
And not much else. Our work is secret.

503
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:20,453
Is that a cipher?

504
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:25,625
It's a rotating transposition
that shifts every day of the diary.

505
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:29,671
Simple, but time-consuming to translate,
even when you have the five-letter keyword.

506
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:31,589
Which is?

507
00:42:31,757 --> 00:42:33,633
We magicians have a circle of trust.

508
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:37,762
You have a circle of trust
with someone whose diary you stole?

509
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:38,972
Maybe I bought it.

510
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:42,475
And you're hoping to find
a great secret in there.

511
00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:46,312
I've already found it.
That's why I'm here.

512
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:55,613
Tesla built one for another magician.

513
00:42:55,781 --> 00:42:59,033
- Why would you want the same thing?
- Call it a professional rivalry.

514
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:03,913
Mr. Tesla has built unusual machines
for unusual people.

515
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:05,623
But he would never talk about it.

516
00:43:05,791 --> 00:43:08,710
I understand discretion.
I just want the machine.

517
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:13,923
Finish your drink.

518
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:16,259
I wanna show you something.

519
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:19,679
I think you'll have a special appreciation
for our work.

520
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:23,224
- I thought it was a secret.
- You're a magician.

521
00:43:23,392 --> 00:43:25,059
Who's gonna believe you?

522
00:43:26,353 --> 00:43:28,396
Not long now.

523
00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:30,982
Our equipment requires
a great deal of current.

524
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:34,986
Tesla electrified the town in exchange
for using the generators when we need to.

525
00:43:37,197 --> 00:43:40,241
We do our tests
when the townspeople are asleep.

526
00:43:40,409 --> 00:43:43,036
Mr. Tesla doesn't wanna scare anyone.

527
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:02,889
Where are the wires?

528
00:44:04,391 --> 00:44:05,558
Exactly.

529
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:18,946
- Where's the generator?
- You saw it last week.

530
00:44:19,114 --> 00:44:22,075
- That must be 10 miles from here.
- Fifteen.

531
00:44:22,242 --> 00:44:25,536
And I have to ride all of them
before I get to bed.

532
00:44:26,413 --> 00:44:29,082
I'll send word for you
in a few days, Mr. Angier.

533
00:44:29,458 --> 00:44:33,252
Magic. Real magic.

534
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:37,382
Now appearing only here
at London's Royal Albert Hall.

535
00:44:37,549 --> 00:44:39,759
One of the miracles of our age.

536
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:42,053
A technological marvel.

537
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:44,430
You've never seen anything like it
in your lives.

538
00:44:44,598 --> 00:44:46,974
Your eyes will not believe
what they're witnessing.

539
00:44:47,142 --> 00:44:50,228
The miracle of Nikola Tesla,
ladies and gentlemen.

540
00:44:50,396 --> 00:44:52,772
Free clean power.
Would you like to know the future?

541
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:55,274
The man speaking now
is going to change the world.

542
00:44:55,442 --> 00:45:00,279
Ladies and gentlemen, come one, come all.
Immediate seating, no waiting.

543
00:45:15,587 --> 00:45:18,715
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm sorry...

544
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:20,633
...but objections have been raised...

545
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:24,178
...concerning the safety...
- They should be. Does that look safe to you?

546
00:45:24,346 --> 00:45:26,764
Part of Thomas Edison's
smear campaign...

547
00:45:26,932 --> 00:45:30,810
...against Mr. Tesla's
superior alternating current.

548
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:32,520
Mr. Alley, please.

549
00:45:32,688 --> 00:45:35,189
We have asked Mr. Tesla
to reconsider...

550
00:45:35,357 --> 00:45:37,984
- Which he will not.
...his presentation.

551
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:42,363
But I've been told he refuses
to appear under any such restrictions.

552
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:45,825
Clear the hall!
This thing is gonna blow!

553
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:48,619
- Clear the hall!
- Ladies and gentlemen, please!

554
00:45:49,288 --> 00:45:51,330
Where's the switch?

555
00:45:55,043 --> 00:45:57,503
This is all perfectly safe.

556
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:29,494
Hey.

557
00:46:29,661 --> 00:46:31,204
Hello, you.

558
00:46:31,371 --> 00:46:34,165
Hello, Jess.

559
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:39,337
Have you had a nice day with Mummy?

560
00:46:41,423 --> 00:46:44,550
Sarah, I love you.

561
00:46:44,718 --> 00:46:48,095
- See? Today it's true.
- Yeah.

562
00:46:48,263 --> 00:46:49,931
Hello.

563
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:53,267
I saw happiness.

564
00:46:53,602 --> 00:46:56,562
Happiness that should have been mine.

565
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:58,064
But I was wrong.

566
00:46:58,232 --> 00:47:02,819
His notebook reveals
that he never had the life that I enVied.

567
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:05,321
The family life
that he craVes one minute...

568
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:09,784
...he rails against the next,
demanding freedom.

569
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:12,829
His mind...
His mind is a diVided one.

570
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:14,831
His soul is restless.

571
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:21,212
His wife and child tormented
by his fickle and contradictory nature.

572
00:47:24,967 --> 00:47:27,385
What do you think?
What do you think you'll call her?

573
00:47:27,553 --> 00:47:28,803
I don't know.

574
00:47:28,971 --> 00:47:31,222
Everybody needs a name.
So, what's hers?

575
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:33,891
Maybe Sarah.

576
00:47:36,186 --> 00:47:38,646
That's a lovely name.
That's a lovely name.

577
00:47:38,814 --> 00:47:41,941
You talk about what you wanna do
for the rest of the day.

578
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:43,901
All right? Go on. You talk with her.

579
00:47:46,446 --> 00:47:48,447
They're taking her away?

580
00:47:50,617 --> 00:47:51,617
To the workhouse?

581
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:56,914
Now, you keep talking.

582
00:47:59,626 --> 00:48:02,795
Tell Owens I've reconsidered.
Take it. Go on, take it.

583
00:48:07,593 --> 00:48:09,635
It's for the best.

584
00:48:14,808 --> 00:48:16,642
Let me see.

585
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:22,690
- I'm gonna learn all the Professor's secrets.
- Only if I teach you how to read.

586
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:25,526
They're just stupid tricks, right?

587
00:48:25,694 --> 00:48:28,487
Haven't helped you
get out of here, have they?

588
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:32,491
Or can't you undo real locks, Professor?

589
00:48:33,702 --> 00:48:36,370
Well, maybe I'm just biding my time.

590
00:48:36,538 --> 00:48:42,376
Maybe one day I'll open my hand,
get your attention, ask:

591
00:48:42,544 --> 00:48:44,629
"Are you watching closely?"

592
00:48:44,796 --> 00:48:47,548
Maybe a magic word or two.

593
00:48:49,468 --> 00:48:51,928
And then I'll be gone.

594
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:58,434
How'd you get so famous, then, eh?

595
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:00,561
Magic.

596
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:05,858
Borden, get back here!

597
00:49:06,026 --> 00:49:07,526
Thank you.

598
00:49:08,153 --> 00:49:10,404
Shut up! Get him down!

599
00:49:10,906 --> 00:49:12,823
Thank you.

600
00:49:13,116 --> 00:49:14,992
Who's got a bloody key?

601
00:49:21,583 --> 00:49:24,085
February 8th, 1899.

602
00:49:24,252 --> 00:49:26,212
Today, finally a breakthrough.

603
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:29,048
Tesla's agreed to see me.

604
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:37,890
It's perfectly safe.

605
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:03,082
So this is the Great Danton.

606
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:07,920
Mr. Alley has effused about your act to me
on any number of occasions.

607
00:50:09,798 --> 00:50:11,257
Hold out other hand.

608
00:50:19,975 --> 00:50:21,809
What's conducting the electricity?

609
00:50:21,977 --> 00:50:25,271
Our bodies, Mr. Angier,
are quite capable of conducting...

610
00:50:25,439 --> 00:50:27,940
...and, indeed, producing energy.

611
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:31,569
Have you eaten, Mr. Angier?

612
00:50:34,614 --> 00:50:36,615
I need something impossible.

613
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:43,164
You are familiar with the phrase,
"Man's reach exceeds his grasp"?

614
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:44,957
It's a lie.

615
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:47,084
Man's grasp exceeds his nerve.

616
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:51,130
Society only tolerates
one change at a time.

617
00:50:52,632 --> 00:50:55,843
The first time
I tried to change the world...

618
00:50:56,011 --> 00:50:57,636
...I was hailed as a visionary.

619
00:50:58,263 --> 00:51:03,768
Second time,
I was asked politely to retire.

620
00:51:04,644 --> 00:51:07,730
So here I am, enjoying my retirement.

621
00:51:08,273 --> 00:51:10,149
Nothing is impossible, Mr. Angier.

622
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:12,026
What you want is simply expensive.

623
00:51:12,652 --> 00:51:14,653
If I were to build for you this machine...

624
00:51:14,821 --> 00:51:17,490
...you would be presenting it
merely as illusion?

625
00:51:17,657 --> 00:51:20,993
Well, if people actually believed
the things I did on-stage...

626
00:51:21,161 --> 00:51:24,789
...they wouldn't clap, they'd scream.
I mean, think of sawing a woman in half.

627
00:51:24,956 --> 00:51:27,833
Mr. Angier, have you considered
the cost of such a machine?

628
00:51:28,001 --> 00:51:29,835
Price is not an object.

629
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:33,839
Perhaps not,
but have you considered the cost?

630
00:51:34,883 --> 00:51:36,175
I'm not sure I follow.

631
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:39,053
Go home. Forget this thing.

632
00:51:39,513 --> 00:51:41,347
I can recognize an obsession.

633
00:51:41,973 --> 00:51:43,516
No good will come of it.

634
00:51:43,683 --> 00:51:45,476
Hasn't good come of your obsessions?

635
00:51:46,144 --> 00:51:48,729
At first.
But I have followed them too long.

636
00:51:48,897 --> 00:51:54,360
I am their slave, and one day,
they will choose to destroy me.

637
00:51:55,904 --> 00:51:59,698
If you understand an obsession,
then you know you won't change my mind.

638
00:52:01,034 --> 00:52:02,034
So be it.

639
00:52:03,662 --> 00:52:04,870
Will you build it?

640
00:52:05,914 --> 00:52:09,416
I have already begun to build it,
Mr. Angier.

641
00:52:09,584 --> 00:52:11,961
I hope you enjoy the mountain air.

642
00:52:12,129 --> 00:52:14,463
This will take some time.

643
00:52:38,488 --> 00:52:40,364
I thought you'd gone.

644
00:52:41,324 --> 00:52:43,492
I don't really have anywhere to go.

645
00:52:46,371 --> 00:52:47,621
You've been sleeping here?

646
00:52:47,789 --> 00:52:52,209
Cutter said it would be all right till we get
another booking. What are you doing?

647
00:52:53,253 --> 00:52:54,587
Research.

648
00:52:54,754 --> 00:52:59,216
Part of a magician's job is to watch
his competition, to see what illusions...

649
00:52:59,384 --> 00:53:02,136
You're going to do something
to that man, aren't you?

650
00:53:02,304 --> 00:53:04,096
Cutter's hoping you'll let things lie.

651
00:53:04,264 --> 00:53:06,932
He says if Borden thinks things
are even between you two...

652
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:08,475
Even?

653
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:11,604
My wife for a couple of his fingers?

654
00:53:11,771 --> 00:53:14,648
He has a family now, right?
And he's performing again.

655
00:53:14,816 --> 00:53:18,569
Borden is living his life just as he always
intended, as if nothing had happened.

656
00:53:18,737 --> 00:53:20,779
And look at... Look at me, all right?

657
00:53:20,947 --> 00:53:23,824
- I'm alone and no theater will touch me.
- Us.

658
00:53:24,784 --> 00:53:27,453
You're going to need a better disguise.

659
00:53:44,596 --> 00:53:45,638
Need a volunteer.

660
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:48,349
What happened?

661
00:53:49,476 --> 00:53:51,518
Did you hurt him?

662
00:53:53,188 --> 00:53:54,438
What happened, Robert?

663
00:53:56,858 --> 00:53:58,275
You, sir.

664
00:53:58,985 --> 00:54:01,820
Just a rubber ball, yes? Thank you.

665
00:54:01,988 --> 00:54:04,490
Just a rubber ball, no.

666
00:54:04,658 --> 00:54:07,826
Not normal. Not a normal rubber ball.

667
00:54:07,994 --> 00:54:09,036
It's magic.

668
00:54:09,871 --> 00:54:11,830
He had a new trick.

669
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:26,720
Was it good?

670
00:54:31,851 --> 00:54:34,270
It was the greatest magic trick
I've ever seen.

671
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:41,860
Did they applaud when you saw it?

672
00:54:42,028 --> 00:54:44,071
The trick was too good,
it was too simple.

673
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:47,324
- The audience hardly had time to see it.
- He's a dreadful magician.

674
00:54:47,492 --> 00:54:50,035
No, he's a wonderful magician.
He's a dreadful showman.

675
00:54:50,203 --> 00:54:52,413
He doesn't know how to dress it up,
how to sell...

676
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:54,206
- How does he do it?
- Uses a double.

677
00:54:54,374 --> 00:54:57,001
No, no, no, it's too simple.
This is a complex illusion.

678
00:54:57,168 --> 00:54:59,545
You only say that
because you don't know the method.

679
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:01,880
It's a double at the end.
It's the only way.

680
00:55:02,048 --> 00:55:04,216
I've seen him perform the trick
three times now.

681
00:55:04,384 --> 00:55:06,885
- The Prestige is the same man.
- No, it's not.

682
00:55:07,053 --> 00:55:09,513
The same man comes out
of that second cabinet.

683
00:55:09,681 --> 00:55:10,764
It's the same man.

684
00:55:12,017 --> 00:55:14,393
He wears padded gloves
to hide his damaged fingers...

685
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:16,437
...but if you look closely you can tell.

686
00:55:19,232 --> 00:55:21,859
He doesn't know how to sell it
to an audience, but I do.

687
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:24,361
Yeah, well, we can use it
as a climax to the show.

688
00:55:24,779 --> 00:55:26,655
Yes.

689
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:30,075
The man stole my life,
I'm gonna steal his trick.

690
00:55:30,243 --> 00:55:33,412
- We gotta find someone who looks like you.
- He doesn't use a double.

691
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:36,915
Robert, I don't know
how Borden does the trick, so either...

692
00:55:37,083 --> 00:55:40,461
You either wait for him to retire
and buy the secret...

693
00:55:40,628 --> 00:55:42,421
...or you listen to how I would do it.

694
00:55:42,589 --> 00:55:47,468
And the only way that I know how to do it
is to find you a bloody good double.

695
00:55:48,428 --> 00:55:50,054
All right.

696
00:55:51,306 --> 00:55:53,807
Take a good look.
Let's get out there and find me.

697
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:57,936
Look. Look.

698
00:56:02,067 --> 00:56:03,650
What's that?

699
00:56:04,819 --> 00:56:07,946
That is for you.

700
00:56:08,114 --> 00:56:09,865
What's this for?

701
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:11,658
Come here.

702
00:56:16,831 --> 00:56:20,584
- I asked you last week. You said you...
- You caught me in a wrong mood.

703
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:22,127
But you went over all the...

704
00:56:22,295 --> 00:56:25,839
Sarah, I'm allowed to change my mind,
aren't I?

705
00:56:26,341 --> 00:56:29,760
The act is taking off,
soon we'll be in a bigger theater.

706
00:56:29,928 --> 00:56:31,136
Things will work out.

707
00:56:33,598 --> 00:56:35,307
I can't believe it. Thank you.

708
00:56:35,475 --> 00:56:37,351
Thank you. It's beautiful.

709
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:45,818
Gerry?

710
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:47,236
Darling, look at you.

711
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:50,155
Mr. Cutter, Mr. Angier,
I'd like you to meet Gerald Root.

712
00:56:55,328 --> 00:56:58,705
A pleasure.
Pleasure to meet you fine gentlemen.

713
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:03,168
Would you like for me
to tell you a little joke? Come here.

714
00:57:05,004 --> 00:57:07,005
There we are. Yes?

715
00:57:07,173 --> 00:57:09,174
Are you laughing now?

716
00:57:11,386 --> 00:57:14,179
Oh, dear, I have to take a piss.

717
00:57:15,890 --> 00:57:18,684
- He's out of his mind.
- Of course. He's an out-of-work actor.

718
00:57:18,852 --> 00:57:20,686
He's perfect. He needs a little help...

719
00:57:20,854 --> 00:57:23,689
...but when I get done with him,
he could be your brother.

720
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:26,358
I don't need him to be my brother,
I need him to be me.

721
00:57:26,526 --> 00:57:28,152
Give me a month.

722
00:57:32,031 --> 00:57:33,866
Come around.

723
00:57:35,034 --> 00:57:39,371
So you open the door and...

724
00:57:46,629 --> 00:57:48,213
Come on.

725
00:57:52,093 --> 00:57:55,846
- Couldn't you have found a softer one?
- Well, it's not for sleeping on.

726
00:57:56,431 --> 00:57:58,390
So if you come down through there...

727
00:58:01,102 --> 00:58:04,104
...does Root go up through there?
- Yep.

728
00:58:04,522 --> 00:58:06,231
It's going to be amazing, Robert.

729
00:58:06,774 --> 00:58:10,569
Well, it has to be.
Borden's trick is getting noticed.

730
00:58:12,614 --> 00:58:14,990
The place was packed today.

731
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:18,410
You went and saw his show again.

732
00:58:18,578 --> 00:58:20,913
Ready to meet yourself, Mr. Angier?

733
00:58:29,589 --> 00:58:31,590
All I have to do is keep myself drunk...

734
00:58:31,758 --> 00:58:34,051
...and no one will be able
to tell the difference.

735
00:58:34,219 --> 00:58:36,094
Have a little faith, sir.

736
00:58:36,262 --> 00:58:41,141
Now, would you favor us
with a performance, Mr. Root?

737
00:58:45,063 --> 00:58:46,480
Jesus.

738
00:59:01,871 --> 00:59:05,082
Yes, you would drink too
if you knew the world half as well as I do.

739
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:10,462
Did you think you were unique?

740
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:13,131
I have been Caesar. I played Faust.

741
00:59:13,299 --> 00:59:16,301
How difficult could it possibly be
to play the Great Danton?

742
00:59:16,469 --> 00:59:19,638
You can go back to being yourself now,
Root, for nothing.

743
00:59:19,806 --> 00:59:21,974
I'd rather be him for now.

744
00:59:22,141 --> 00:59:24,935
I find it amusing.

745
00:59:28,314 --> 00:59:32,401
My liege, I did deny no prisoners.

746
00:59:33,528 --> 00:59:35,445
- You look wonderful.
- Oh, thank you.

747
00:59:35,613 --> 00:59:38,699
Root has to keep a low profile.
Anyone sees him, the game's up.

748
00:59:38,866 --> 00:59:41,827
I don't know how you do these things.
I'm not sure I wanna know.

749
00:59:42,036 --> 00:59:44,162
Have you thought
what we should call the trick?

750
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:45,789
There's no point in being coy.

751
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:48,125
Borden calls his trick
"The Transported Man."

752
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:55,007
Ladies and gentlemen,
much of what you've seen tonight...

753
00:59:55,174 --> 01:00:00,429
...may be termed as illusions
or entertaining trifles.

754
01:00:04,017 --> 01:00:05,183
Alas...

755
01:00:07,353 --> 01:00:09,813
...I cannot claim
this next feat as illusion.

756
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:11,857
Watch carefully.

757
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:15,819
You'll see no trickery...

758
01:00:16,279 --> 01:00:17,863
...for no trickery is employed.

759
01:00:19,032 --> 01:00:22,367
Merely a technique familiar
to certain citizens of the Orient...

760
01:00:22,535 --> 01:00:24,703
...and various holy men
of the Himalayas.

761
01:00:28,166 --> 01:00:30,876
Indeed, many of you
may be familiar with this technique...

762
01:00:31,044 --> 01:00:34,087
...but for those of you who aren't,
do not be alarmed...

763
01:00:34,255 --> 01:00:37,341
...what you're about to see
is considered safe.

764
01:01:09,332 --> 01:01:11,416
To our achievement.

765
01:01:12,085 --> 01:01:14,753
The manager says
he's never seen a reaction like it.

766
01:01:14,921 --> 01:01:18,131
At least he got to see it.
I spent the ovation hiding under the stage.

767
01:01:18,299 --> 01:01:20,717
No one cares about the man
who disappears into the box.

768
01:01:20,885 --> 01:01:22,636
They care about the one who comes out.

769
01:01:22,804 --> 01:01:25,597
- I care about the man in the box.
- Thank you.

770
01:01:25,765 --> 01:01:29,101
I don't know. Maybe...
Maybe we could switch before the trick.

771
01:01:29,268 --> 01:01:31,436
I could be the Prestige
and Root ends up below.

772
01:01:31,604 --> 01:01:34,272
No, the anticipation of the trick
is everything.

773
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:37,484
We need your showmanship
to build up the suspense.

774
01:01:37,652 --> 01:01:40,946
Once Root opens his mouth, it's over.
He can't introduce this trick.

775
01:01:41,114 --> 01:01:43,949
Of course I can. I'm the Great Danton.

776
01:01:44,117 --> 01:01:47,619
Root, you bloody fool.
Get out of that wardrobe and makeup.

777
01:01:47,787 --> 01:01:50,288
Anyone could walk in here at any minute.

778
01:01:50,456 --> 01:01:52,457
Congratulations, all.

779
01:01:52,792 --> 01:01:56,211
Life is not full of these moments, Robbie.
We worked hard.

780
01:01:56,379 --> 01:01:57,963
We need to celebrate properly.

781
01:02:01,634 --> 01:02:04,177
What's wrong? Is it your wife?

782
01:02:04,345 --> 01:02:06,596
No. No, it's the trick.
It isn't good enough.

783
01:02:06,764 --> 01:02:09,975
Borden's trick is nothing compared to ours.
He has no style.

784
01:02:10,143 --> 01:02:13,979
Well, he doesn't spend the finale
hiding under the stage.

785
01:02:14,147 --> 01:02:15,814
I need to know how he does it.

786
01:02:15,982 --> 01:02:19,359
- Why?
- So I can do it better.

787
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:23,488
I need you to go and work for him.

788
01:02:27,118 --> 01:02:28,785
Work for him? Are you joking?

789
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:31,204
You'll be my spy.

790
01:02:31,372 --> 01:02:33,457
We just got our start.
You want me to leave?

791
01:02:33,624 --> 01:02:35,667
That's how we advance.
Think of it, Olivia.

792
01:02:35,835 --> 01:02:39,463
We got people excited, but imagine
what we could do with the real illusion.

793
01:02:39,630 --> 01:02:43,467
We'd have the greatest magic act
anyone's ever seen.

794
01:02:43,634 --> 01:02:45,010
He knows I work for you.

795
01:02:45,178 --> 01:02:48,472
Exactly why he'll wanna hire you.
He'll want my secret.

796
01:02:48,639 --> 01:02:52,684
- Why would he trust me?
- Because you're gonna tell him the truth.

797
01:03:05,072 --> 01:03:06,072
Good girl.

798
01:03:09,327 --> 01:03:12,829
You must be curious to see what
so much money has bought you, Mr. Angier.

799
01:03:13,456 --> 01:03:16,333
It's fitting you should be here
for maiden voyage.

800
01:03:16,501 --> 01:03:18,210
Your hat.

801
01:03:26,344 --> 01:03:28,553
You might wanna stand back.

802
01:03:49,408 --> 01:03:50,408
I don't understand.

803
01:03:50,576 --> 01:03:52,869
Perhaps it would be best
if you left us to it.

804
01:03:53,037 --> 01:03:55,163
- Is there a problem, Mr. Tesla?
- No, no, no.

805
01:03:55,331 --> 01:03:56,873
- Come back next week.
- Next week?

806
01:03:57,041 --> 01:03:59,125
- Come back... Next week, it'll be fine.
- Tesla.

807
01:03:59,293 --> 01:04:02,087
She's just a little temperamental
sometimes.

808
01:04:06,968 --> 01:04:09,761
- Interesting workshop.
- Yeah, we make do.

809
01:04:09,929 --> 01:04:12,264
- My name is Olivia Wenscombe...
- I know who you are.

810
01:04:12,431 --> 01:04:13,765
You here to steal my show?

811
01:04:13,933 --> 01:04:15,725
I'm here to give it what it's missing.

812
01:04:15,893 --> 01:04:19,062
- Yeah? What might that be?
- Me.

813
01:04:20,606 --> 01:04:24,568
I was just saying that, wasn't I, Bernard?
Woman's touch.

814
01:04:24,735 --> 01:04:26,570
- I've left Angier.
- All right.

815
01:04:26,737 --> 01:04:29,447
- I want a job.
- Yeah?

816
01:04:29,615 --> 01:04:32,617
- I know you've no reason to trust me...
- Why wouldn't I trust you?

817
01:04:32,785 --> 01:04:36,621
I mean, you're only the mistress
of my enemy. Why wouldn't I trust you?

818
01:04:38,207 --> 01:04:40,125
- Mr. Borden...
- Alfred.

819
01:04:42,545 --> 01:04:44,129
I'm going to tell you the truth.

820
01:04:44,297 --> 01:04:47,465
Now that is a slippery notion
in our line of work...

821
01:04:47,633 --> 01:04:48,925
...isn't it, Miss Wenscombe?

822
01:04:51,053 --> 01:04:53,638
I am here because he sent me here.

823
01:04:53,806 --> 01:04:56,266
He wants me to work for you
and steal your secret.

824
01:04:56,434 --> 01:04:58,101
What does he need my secret for?

825
01:04:58,269 --> 01:04:59,644
His trick is top-notch.

826
01:05:00,271 --> 01:05:03,481
He vanishes and then he reappears
on the other side of the stage...

827
01:05:03,649 --> 01:05:07,485
...mute, overweight and,
unless I'm mistaken, very drunk.

828
01:05:07,653 --> 01:05:09,321
It's astonishing. How does he do it?

829
01:05:09,780 --> 01:05:14,659
And tell me, Olivia, does he enjoy
taking his bows under the stage?

830
01:05:14,827 --> 01:05:15,827
No, it's killing him.

831
01:05:15,995 --> 01:05:17,996
He's obsessed
with discovering your methods.

832
01:05:18,164 --> 01:05:19,372
He thinks of nothing else.

833
01:05:19,540 --> 01:05:22,626
He takes no pleasure in our success,
and I've had enough.

834
01:05:22,793 --> 01:05:24,210
There is no future with him.

835
01:05:26,422 --> 01:05:30,050
He sent me here to steal your secrets,
but I've actually come to offer you his.

836
01:05:30,551 --> 01:05:34,137
This is the truth, is it?

837
01:05:38,643 --> 01:05:40,352
Think you'd better get dressed, sir.

838
01:05:40,519 --> 01:05:42,729
Root, you're late
and more drunk than usual.

839
01:05:42,897 --> 01:05:45,523
- Now, get down below stairs right away.
- No.

840
01:05:47,109 --> 01:05:50,195
No, we need to have
a little chat, Mr. Cutter.

841
01:05:50,363 --> 01:05:51,404
We have a problem.

842
01:05:51,572 --> 01:05:54,157
Cutter, Borden is performing
right across the street.

843
01:05:54,325 --> 01:05:56,952
Yeah? We have a bigger problem.

844
01:05:58,079 --> 01:06:01,039
Root. He's realized
he can make demands.

845
01:06:01,874 --> 01:06:03,208
Wha...? He's blackmailing us?

846
01:06:03,376 --> 01:06:07,545
I was surprised, to tell you the truth.
It usually takes them longer to figure it out.

847
01:06:07,713 --> 01:06:10,507
- Well, how much does he want?
- Well, it makes no difference.

848
01:06:10,675 --> 01:06:14,052
- We gotta stop doing the trick.
- Stop the trick? Cutter, look at this.

849
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:16,388
Well, look at yesterday's,
look at last week...

850
01:06:16,555 --> 01:06:19,891
...where they said you were
the premier stage performer in London.

851
01:06:20,059 --> 01:06:21,643
Not magician, mind you.

852
01:06:21,811 --> 01:06:24,396
- Performer of any kind.
- Well, what's your point?

853
01:06:24,563 --> 01:06:26,856
My point is, Robert,
is you've climbed too high...

854
01:06:27,024 --> 01:06:29,234
...to get away
with professional embarrassment.

855
01:06:29,819 --> 01:06:32,612
We don't do any tricks we can't control.

856
01:06:34,824 --> 01:06:36,616
Just pay him whatever he wants for now.

857
01:06:36,784 --> 01:06:40,203
We keep doing the trick until Borden opens
and then we'll phase it out.

858
01:06:41,288 --> 01:06:42,747
All right.

859
01:06:45,418 --> 01:06:49,421
Cutter was always surprised
how fast Root turned bad.

860
01:06:50,006 --> 01:06:54,009
To what do I owe the pleasure
of this rather welcome pint of ale?

861
01:06:54,176 --> 01:06:57,554
You're the Great Danton, aren't you?

862
01:06:57,722 --> 01:07:01,057
Of course I am, but don't advertise it
because I'll be mobbed with fans.

863
01:07:01,225 --> 01:07:03,101
We paid him enough
to keep him in beers...

864
01:07:03,269 --> 01:07:05,437
...so you wouldn't expect him
to rock the boat.

865
01:07:05,604 --> 01:07:08,148
Indeed, many of you
may be familiar with this technique.

866
01:07:08,315 --> 01:07:11,943
But for those of you who aren't,
do not be alarmed...

867
01:07:12,111 --> 01:07:15,155
...what you're about to see
is considered safe.

868
01:07:15,322 --> 01:07:16,614
And who are you?

869
01:07:16,782 --> 01:07:22,620
I am a humble admirer
and a fellow practitioner.

870
01:07:22,788 --> 01:07:23,955
Very good.

871
01:07:33,466 --> 01:07:36,134
- Another?
- Oh, if you insist.

872
01:07:36,302 --> 01:07:38,219
- Another.
- I'm not performing tonight.

873
01:07:38,387 --> 01:07:40,138
Well, I'm only doing one show...

874
01:07:40,306 --> 01:07:43,475
...but to be frank, my people
pretty much run things these days.

875
01:07:43,642 --> 01:07:44,768
Get up there!

876
01:07:46,228 --> 01:07:47,228
Get up!

877
01:07:47,396 --> 01:07:49,564
Your illusion, The Transported Man...

878
01:07:49,732 --> 01:07:52,692
...l'm not claiming
to know your methods or anything...

879
01:07:53,402 --> 01:07:59,866
...but I had a similar trick in my act,
and I used a double.

880
01:08:01,285 --> 01:08:02,368
I see. Very good.

881
01:08:02,536 --> 01:08:05,121
Well, it was, and then it went bad.

882
01:08:05,289 --> 01:08:10,668
What I didn't count on, was that
when I incorporated this bloke into my act...

883
01:08:10,836 --> 01:08:12,837
...he had complete power over me.

884
01:08:14,173 --> 01:08:15,632
Complete power, you say.

885
01:08:33,192 --> 01:08:38,363
Be very careful giving someone
that power over you.

886
01:08:40,741 --> 01:08:42,700
Well, thank you.

887
01:08:42,868 --> 01:08:45,161
Yes, thank you for the warning.

888
01:08:47,331 --> 01:08:49,332
Cheers.

889
01:08:50,042 --> 01:08:52,043
I cannot claim this next feat as illusion.

890
01:08:52,211 --> 01:08:56,422
What you're about to see
is considered safe.

891
01:09:36,422 --> 01:09:38,631
The Great Danton.

892
01:09:45,014 --> 01:09:46,681
I apologize.

893
01:09:46,849 --> 01:09:50,602
There simply is too much magic...

894
01:09:50,769 --> 01:09:55,773
...for my stage at the Pantages
across the street.

895
01:09:57,109 --> 01:09:59,652
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

896
01:09:59,820 --> 01:10:03,239
Pardon my intrusion.

897
01:10:03,908 --> 01:10:06,743
- Bravo!
- And go easy on the poor chap.

898
01:10:06,911 --> 01:10:09,996
He does try so very hard.

899
01:10:12,625 --> 01:10:14,459
I don't know how Borden found him.

900
01:10:14,627 --> 01:10:16,294
Kept him under wraps, I was careful.

901
01:10:16,462 --> 01:10:18,504
Yeah, well, he did.

902
01:10:19,340 --> 01:10:20,465
Do you think it was her?

903
01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:30,516
You weren't expecting me?

904
01:10:30,684 --> 01:10:33,353
I was expecting you sooner.
Your message said afternoon.

905
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:35,647
It takes a bit
for me to get around these days.

906
01:10:35,981 --> 01:10:37,649
He's taken everything from me.

907
01:10:37,816 --> 01:10:40,485
My wife, my career, now you.

908
01:10:40,653 --> 01:10:42,028
What do you mean?
You sent me...

909
01:10:42,196 --> 01:10:44,864
I sent you to steal his secret,
not to improve his act.

910
01:10:45,032 --> 01:10:46,491
- That's my job.
- Or fall in love.

911
01:10:46,659 --> 01:10:49,244
- I did everything you asked!
- Yes? Yes?

912
01:10:49,411 --> 01:10:51,955
- Then how does he do it?
- Cutter was right, a double.

913
01:10:52,122 --> 01:10:55,375
- Of course Borden said that.
- He didn't say anything. I've seen things.

914
01:10:55,542 --> 01:10:59,337
Makeup, glasses, wigs. We don't use it
for the show, but I've seen it backstage.

915
01:10:59,505 --> 01:11:03,216
It's misdirection. He leaves things around
to make you think he's using a double.

916
01:11:03,384 --> 01:11:05,301
All the time?
He doesn't know when I look.

917
01:11:05,469 --> 01:11:07,345
All the time, Olivia!

918
01:11:07,513 --> 01:11:09,847
That's who he is! That's what it takes!

919
01:11:10,015 --> 01:11:12,350
He lives his act! Don't you see?

920
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:17,689
Just because you're sleeping with him
doesn't mean he trusts you.

921
01:11:17,856 --> 01:11:20,191
You think you can see everything,
don't you?

922
01:11:20,359 --> 01:11:24,028
But the Great Danton is a blind fool.
His notebook.

923
01:11:26,073 --> 01:11:28,199
You stole it?

924
01:11:28,367 --> 01:11:30,159
I borrowed it for tonight.

925
01:11:30,327 --> 01:11:32,287
I thought you could translate it,
but now...

926
01:11:32,454 --> 01:11:33,538
- I can't.
- You can't?

927
01:11:33,706 --> 01:11:36,541
Olivia, no one can, it's a cipher.

928
01:11:36,709 --> 01:11:39,627
Even with the keyword
it would take months to decode.

929
01:11:40,129 --> 01:11:43,047
- And without the keyword?
- Perhaps never.

930
01:11:43,215 --> 01:11:44,632
- We'll see.
- We will not see.

931
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:47,719
If I don't get that back to him tomorrow,
he'll know I took it.

932
01:11:47,886 --> 01:11:50,054
- Leave him.
- I can't. He knows where I live.

933
01:11:51,473 --> 01:11:53,391
This is his diary, Olivia.

934
01:11:53,559 --> 01:11:56,227
All of his secrets
are right here in my hands.

935
01:11:57,229 --> 01:11:58,438
Won't bring your wife back.

936
01:11:58,605 --> 01:12:01,774
I don't care about my wife,
I care about his secret.

937
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:16,414
Look...

938
01:12:17,416 --> 01:12:19,584
...l'll go to his workshop
and stage a break-in.

939
01:12:19,752 --> 01:12:23,921
- He'll know you took it.
- Yes, me. Not you.

940
01:12:24,089 --> 01:12:25,882
Understand?

941
01:12:34,767 --> 01:12:36,017
Robert.

942
01:12:37,978 --> 01:12:40,646
I have fallen in love with him.

943
01:12:41,648 --> 01:12:44,359
Then I know how hard
this has been for you.

944
01:12:52,743 --> 01:12:53,951
Notebook?

945
01:12:56,872 --> 01:12:58,748
Then he's just getting started.

946
01:13:29,196 --> 01:13:30,780
- Good evening.
- Professor.

947
01:13:32,574 --> 01:13:33,699
Professor.

948
01:13:34,159 --> 01:13:35,952
- I...
- Could I get your autograph?

949
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:37,578
- I'm walking tonight.
- Professor.

950
01:13:37,746 --> 01:13:39,539
Let him come. I don't care.

951
01:13:39,706 --> 01:13:42,125
- Professor.
- Professor.

952
01:15:06,877 --> 01:15:09,337
- You all right?
- I'm alive.

953
01:15:09,505 --> 01:15:11,589
Saves me cutting you an air hole.

954
01:15:25,687 --> 01:15:28,147
- I'm impressed.
- Why's that?

955
01:15:28,315 --> 01:15:30,816
You're finally getting your hands dirty.

956
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:34,153
It's what a good trick costs, Angier.

957
01:15:34,321 --> 01:15:35,655
Risk.

958
01:15:35,822 --> 01:15:37,073
Sacrifice.

959
01:15:37,616 --> 01:15:41,285
The sacrifice, I'm afraid, is gonna be yours,
unless you give me what I want.

960
01:15:42,746 --> 01:15:44,789
- Which is?
- Your secret.

961
01:15:45,332 --> 01:15:47,208
My secret?

962
01:15:47,376 --> 01:15:49,627
Your method for The Transported Man.

963
01:15:49,795 --> 01:15:52,421
Fallon wouldn't tell me.
He doesn't seem to talk at all.

964
01:15:52,589 --> 01:15:53,839
You have my notebook.

965
01:15:54,007 --> 01:15:55,967
Useless without the keyword.

966
01:15:57,469 --> 01:15:59,095
Write down your method, Mr. Borden.

967
01:15:59,263 --> 01:16:01,138
Describe it in full.

968
01:16:14,194 --> 01:16:16,821
I want the whole method,
not the keyword.

969
01:16:16,989 --> 01:16:19,365
I don't even know
if your secret's in your notebook.

970
01:16:19,533 --> 01:16:21,826
The keyword is the method.

971
01:16:25,622 --> 01:16:26,789
Where's my ingénieur?

972
01:16:34,089 --> 01:16:36,507
- Alive?
- How fast can you dig?

973
01:16:39,094 --> 01:16:42,054
Fallon! You hear me? Fallon!

974
01:16:43,473 --> 01:16:46,017
- How's the arm?
- Still attached.

975
01:16:47,561 --> 01:16:49,895
- Did you find your answer?
- Our answer.

976
01:16:50,063 --> 01:16:52,857
Cutter, I haven't looked yet.
I wanted you to share this.

977
01:16:53,025 --> 01:16:55,526
I already know how he does it, Robert.

978
01:16:55,694 --> 01:16:58,529
The same way he always has.
The same way as we do.

979
01:16:58,697 --> 01:17:01,073
It's just that you want something more.

980
01:17:01,241 --> 01:17:02,867
Well, let's find out then,
shall we?

981
01:17:08,373 --> 01:17:09,665
What does it mean?

982
01:17:17,716 --> 01:17:20,009
It means, Cutter,
we have a journey ahead of us.

983
01:17:20,177 --> 01:17:22,887
- To America.
- Robert?

984
01:17:23,055 --> 01:17:25,222
Listen to me.

985
01:17:26,141 --> 01:17:29,518
Obsession is a young man's game.

986
01:17:29,686 --> 01:17:33,606
- Oh, come on.
- I can't follow you any further in it.

987
01:17:34,858 --> 01:17:36,567
I can't. I'm sorry.

988
01:17:40,906 --> 01:17:42,406
Then the rest is up to me.

989
01:17:44,493 --> 01:17:46,118
I'm sorry.

990
01:17:51,333 --> 01:17:54,752
Good evening. Hello, darling.

991
01:17:55,170 --> 01:17:56,545
Champagne, your finest.

992
01:17:57,255 --> 01:17:59,674
I didn't know we were
going to be joined for dinner.

993
01:17:59,841 --> 01:18:02,760
- Absolutely. We are celebrating.
- Miss Wenscombe.

994
01:18:02,928 --> 01:18:05,888
Mr. Fallon.
Well, what are we celebrating?

995
01:18:06,056 --> 01:18:08,474
Well, we've hit upon a new trick,
haven't we, Fallon?

996
01:18:08,642 --> 01:18:11,560
- What trick, Freddy?
- Yes, Freddy, what trick?

997
01:18:11,728 --> 01:18:15,981
I am going to bury myself alive
every night...

998
01:18:16,149 --> 01:18:19,944
...and then someone will come along
and dig me up. Wonderful.

999
01:18:20,112 --> 01:18:23,989
- No, I think my husband's had quite enough.
- No, pour the champagne. Come on, pour...

1000
01:18:24,157 --> 01:18:26,909
Right. Sarah, don't talk to me like that.
I'm not a child.

1001
01:18:27,077 --> 01:18:29,036
- Perhaps it would...
- Perhaps, Mr. Fallon...

1002
01:18:29,204 --> 01:18:32,289
...you might escort Miss Wenscombe home.
My husband's being a bore.

1003
01:18:32,457 --> 01:18:36,001
- I see no reason why you have to suffer.
- Oh, please. Don't ruin this evening.

1004
01:18:39,464 --> 01:18:43,008
Good night, Mrs. Borden.
Good night, Freddy.

1005
01:18:46,805 --> 01:18:48,973
- "Freddy"?
- Well, that's my name.

1006
01:18:49,141 --> 01:18:53,394
- Not at home.
- Well, I'm not always at home, am I?

1007
01:18:54,354 --> 01:18:57,398
Well, couldn't you have at least
taken off the beard?

1008
01:18:57,566 --> 01:19:01,110
Sarah, I just came from
the bloody theater just now.

1009
01:19:01,278 --> 01:19:02,987
All right? And I'm out in public.

1010
01:19:03,155 --> 01:19:06,282
- Everybody else loves it.
- Why are you being like this, Alfred?

1011
01:19:06,908 --> 01:19:09,201
I had a terrible ordeal today.

1012
01:19:09,578 --> 01:19:13,998
I thought that something very precious...

1013
01:19:14,166 --> 01:19:16,083
...had been lost to me.

1014
01:19:16,251 --> 01:19:19,336
So I just wanted to celebrate.
Just a little.

1015
01:19:20,172 --> 01:19:21,797
All right, what?

1016
01:19:21,965 --> 01:19:23,674
What did you lose?

1017
01:19:28,263 --> 01:19:29,638
I see, more secrets.

1018
01:19:30,599 --> 01:19:33,684
Sarah, secrets are my life.

1019
01:19:35,729 --> 01:19:37,772
- Our life.
- No, Alfred, stop.

1020
01:19:37,939 --> 01:19:41,484
This isn't you. Stop performing.

1021
01:20:05,717 --> 01:20:08,219
I thought I had the place
to myself, Mr. Brent.

1022
01:20:08,386 --> 01:20:09,762
Unexpected guests.

1023
01:20:09,930 --> 01:20:13,390
Not very polite. A lot of questions.

1024
01:20:13,558 --> 01:20:16,185
First I thought they might work
for the government.

1025
01:20:16,353 --> 01:20:18,229
- No?
- Worse.

1026
01:20:18,396 --> 01:20:20,564
They work for Thomas Edison.

1027
01:20:21,942 --> 01:20:24,360
Today, a most curious development.

1028
01:20:24,528 --> 01:20:28,572
His assistant came to us
with a proposition.

1029
01:20:29,366 --> 01:20:32,618
Obviously, Angier has sent her
and told her to admit as much.

1030
01:20:32,786 --> 01:20:35,538
Does he enjoy taking
his bows under the stage?

1031
01:20:35,705 --> 01:20:39,375
He sent me here to steal your secrets,
but I've actually come to offer you his.

1032
01:20:39,876 --> 01:20:43,420
This is the truth, is it?

1033
01:20:51,596 --> 01:20:54,890
No, that's what he told me to tell you.
The truth...

1034
01:20:55,058 --> 01:20:58,853
...is that I loved him, and I stood by him,
and he sent me to you...

1035
01:20:59,020 --> 01:21:02,398
...like he would send a stagehand
to pick up his shirts.

1036
01:21:02,566 --> 01:21:05,234
I hate him for that.

1037
01:21:05,569 --> 01:21:09,405
I can spot Angier's methods
from the back of the theater.

1038
01:21:10,574 --> 01:21:12,616
So, what could you possibly
have to offer me?

1039
01:21:13,118 --> 01:21:15,870
You know how he does his tricks,
but you can't understand...

1040
01:21:16,037 --> 01:21:18,497
...why no one can see yours are better.
You hide this.

1041
01:21:18,665 --> 01:21:22,626
I had to look very closely to spot it when
you were performing The Transported Man...

1042
01:21:22,794 --> 01:21:25,421
...but this makes you unique.

1043
01:21:25,589 --> 01:21:27,756
It shows the audience
you aren't using a double.

1044
01:21:27,924 --> 01:21:30,009
You mustn't hide it,
display it proudly.

1045
01:21:30,176 --> 01:21:34,471
I'm sure it takes great skill
to perform illusions with one good hand.

1046
01:21:34,931 --> 01:21:36,974
Yeah, it does.

1047
01:21:38,476 --> 01:21:41,061
So let people know.

1048
01:21:41,730 --> 01:21:45,482
You could be so much more than he is,
and I can show you how.

1049
01:21:46,985 --> 01:21:48,777
I think she's telling the truth.

1050
01:21:49,654 --> 01:21:51,780
I think we cannot trust her.

1051
01:21:55,368 --> 01:21:57,786
But I loVe her. I need her.

1052
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:02,166
To open myself to such a relationship...

1053
01:22:02,334 --> 01:22:06,170
...to the dangers of such an affair...

1054
01:22:06,671 --> 01:22:11,050
...I need assurances of fidelity. Of love.

1055
01:22:12,177 --> 01:22:13,677
But how to be sure?

1056
01:22:16,056 --> 01:22:20,309
I know a way.
It's the only way to know her mind.

1057
01:22:20,477 --> 01:22:22,144
How could he send you away?

1058
01:22:24,022 --> 01:22:25,856
She must help me rid ourselves
of Angier.

1059
01:22:33,823 --> 01:22:36,617
Today, my mistress proves
her truthfulness.

1060
01:22:36,785 --> 01:22:39,036
Not to me, you understand.

1061
01:22:39,245 --> 01:22:41,246
I'Ve been conVinced
since she led me to Root.

1062
01:22:41,414 --> 01:22:47,211
Today, Olivia proves her love for me
to you, Angier.

1063
01:22:47,379 --> 01:22:49,254
Yes, Angier.

1064
01:22:49,422 --> 01:22:51,715
She gave you this notebook
at my request.

1065
01:22:51,883 --> 01:22:57,054
And, yes, "Tesla" is merely the key
to my diary, not to my trick.

1066
01:22:57,222 --> 01:23:01,767
Did you really think I'd part
with my secret so easily after so much?

1067
01:23:01,935 --> 01:23:03,185
Goodbye, Angier.

1068
01:23:03,353 --> 01:23:07,439
May you find solace for your thwarted
ambition back in your American home.

1069
01:23:17,951 --> 01:23:19,243
Tesla!

1070
01:23:20,537 --> 01:23:25,124
Tesla! Alley! Alley!

1071
01:23:25,291 --> 01:23:27,710
Tesla never made a machine
like the one I asked for.

1072
01:23:27,877 --> 01:23:30,587
- We never said he had.
- But you let me believe that he had.

1073
01:23:30,755 --> 01:23:33,424
You stole my money because
your funding had been cut off.

1074
01:23:33,591 --> 01:23:37,344
You've been shooting sparks at my top hat,
laughing at me all along...

1075
01:23:37,512 --> 01:23:39,972
...while using my money
to stave off ruin.

1076
01:23:41,016 --> 01:23:42,933
- Now, I have seen Edison's men.
- Where?

1077
01:23:43,101 --> 01:23:46,103
In the hotel. And I have every mind
to bring them up here myself.

1078
01:23:46,271 --> 01:23:48,272
That would be unwise, Mr. Angier.

1079
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:51,483
It is true that you are
our last remaining financier...

1080
01:23:51,651 --> 01:23:53,444
...but we have not stolen your money.

1081
01:23:53,611 --> 01:23:54,945
Sir, my cat.

1082
01:23:55,113 --> 01:23:58,115
When I told you I could make
your machine, I spoke a simple truth.

1083
01:23:58,283 --> 01:24:01,702
- Then why isn't the machine working?
- Because exact science, Mr. Angier...

1084
01:24:01,870 --> 01:24:03,120
...is not an exact science.

1085
01:24:03,538 --> 01:24:06,415
The machine simply does not operate
as expected.

1086
01:24:06,583 --> 01:24:08,834
It requires further examination.

1087
01:24:09,002 --> 01:24:11,628
- So where did my top hat go?
- Nowhere.

1088
01:24:11,796 --> 01:24:14,548
We tried the damn thing a dozen times.

1089
01:24:14,716 --> 01:24:16,050
The hat went nowhere.

1090
01:24:16,217 --> 01:24:18,135
We need to try different material.

1091
01:24:18,303 --> 01:24:21,972
It may provoke a different result.

1092
01:24:22,932 --> 01:24:24,600
Copernicus, come on.

1093
01:24:31,775 --> 01:24:36,278
You are responsible for whatever happens
to this animal, doctor.

1094
01:24:57,342 --> 01:25:01,011
I hope that whatever you were really doing
with my money was more worthwhile...

1095
01:25:01,179 --> 01:25:03,138
...Mr. Tesla.

1096
01:25:58,236 --> 01:25:59,236
Alley!

1097
01:26:02,657 --> 01:26:03,907
So the machine was working.

1098
01:26:04,075 --> 01:26:07,578
I never bothered to check the calibration
because the hat never moved.

1099
01:26:07,745 --> 01:26:10,831
These things never quite work
as you expect them to, Mr. Angier.

1100
01:26:10,999 --> 01:26:13,167
That's one of the principal
beauties of science.

1101
01:26:13,334 --> 01:26:16,712
I'll need a couple of weeks to iron out
the problems with the machine.

1102
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:19,089
We'll send word when it's ready.

1103
01:26:21,259 --> 01:26:23,385
Don't forget your hat.

1104
01:26:24,220 --> 01:26:27,973
- Well, which one is mine?
- They're all your hats, Mr. Angier.

1105
01:26:33,980 --> 01:26:36,899
You look so pretty
in this new dress of yours.

1106
01:26:37,066 --> 01:26:40,944
- Are we going to the zoo this afternoon?
- No, no, no. Daddy has some errands to run.

1107
01:26:41,112 --> 01:26:43,113
- But you promised.
- I promised, did I?

1108
01:26:43,281 --> 01:26:45,449
Then go to the zoo we shall.

1109
01:26:45,617 --> 01:26:48,911
So Daddy will go run his errands
and I'll be back before you know it...

1110
01:26:49,078 --> 01:26:52,789
...so you go get ready.
We'll go see those chimpanzees.

1111
01:26:56,044 --> 01:26:58,003
Sarah.

1112
01:26:58,379 --> 01:26:59,421
What are you doing?

1113
01:27:02,967 --> 01:27:06,094
We each of us have our vices.

1114
01:27:09,140 --> 01:27:12,559
Sarah, whatever you may think...

1115
01:27:13,061 --> 01:27:16,647
...your only competition for my affections
is our little girl.

1116
01:27:16,814 --> 01:27:21,151
I love you. I will always love you
and you alone.

1117
01:27:23,196 --> 01:27:26,406
- You mean it today.
- Absolutely.

1118
01:27:27,242 --> 01:27:30,535
Which makes it so much harder
when you don't.

1119
01:27:40,213 --> 01:27:42,965
Is that more shopping?
She does love the smell of money.

1120
01:27:43,132 --> 01:27:46,468
The little lady wants to go to the zoo,
so I thought you could take her.

1121
01:27:46,636 --> 01:27:49,721
Yeah? I mean,
I can do it tomorrow if not.

1122
01:27:49,889 --> 01:27:55,352
And Sarah, she knows.

1123
01:27:56,187 --> 01:27:59,398
She... I mean, at least she knows
that something's not right...

1124
01:27:59,565 --> 01:28:03,026
...so if you can just do whatever you can
to help me with her.

1125
01:28:03,194 --> 01:28:07,155
Talk to her. Just convince her
that I do love her.

1126
01:28:18,126 --> 01:28:22,170
- What is it, Freddy?
- Just don't call me that, please.

1127
01:28:22,338 --> 01:28:24,881
It's nothing. It's just, you know,
there's sometimes...

1128
01:28:25,049 --> 01:28:27,384
- Sometimes it seems wrong.
- I've told you before...

1129
01:28:27,552 --> 01:28:29,094
...when you're with me,
you're with me.

1130
01:28:29,262 --> 01:28:31,305
Leave your family at home
where they belong.

1131
01:28:31,931 --> 01:28:33,390
I'm trying.

1132
01:28:33,558 --> 01:28:35,058
I'm trying, Olivia.

1133
01:28:35,226 --> 01:28:37,728
- I'll get dressed.
- Yeah.

1134
01:28:39,063 --> 01:28:41,898
I saw Fallon hanging around again.

1135
01:28:42,442 --> 01:28:44,568
There's something
about that man I don't trust.

1136
01:28:44,902 --> 01:28:47,738
You trust me? Then trust Fallon.

1137
01:28:48,239 --> 01:28:50,449
He protects the things that I care about.

1138
01:29:28,780 --> 01:29:31,114
We're sorry to see you go, Mr. Angier.

1139
01:29:31,282 --> 01:29:33,825
We were sorry to see
Mr. Tesla leave as well.

1140
01:29:33,993 --> 01:29:35,994
He was very good to Colorado Springs.

1141
01:29:36,496 --> 01:29:42,459
Mr. Angier, I didn't think it was necessary
to tell Edison's men about the box.

1142
01:29:43,127 --> 01:29:44,127
What box?

1143
01:30:09,612 --> 01:30:12,948
I apologize for leaving
without saying goodbye...

1144
01:30:13,408 --> 01:30:17,577
...but I seem to have outstayed
my welcome in Colorado.

1145
01:30:18,329 --> 01:30:22,791
The truly extraordinary is not
permitted in science and industry.

1146
01:30:22,959 --> 01:30:28,380
Perhaps you'll find more luck in your field,
where people are happy to be mystified.

1147
01:30:28,548 --> 01:30:32,467
You will find what
you are looking for in this box.

1148
01:30:32,885 --> 01:30:36,930
Alley has written you
a thorough set of instructions.

1149
01:30:37,098 --> 01:30:41,726
I add only one suggestion
on using the machine:

1150
01:30:41,894 --> 01:30:43,854
Destroy it.

1151
01:30:44,021 --> 01:30:47,107
Drop it to the bottom
of the deepest ocean.

1152
01:30:47,275 --> 01:30:50,485
Such a thing will bring you only misery.

1153
01:30:54,532 --> 01:30:58,076
Tesla's warning is as unheeded
as he knew it would be.

1154
01:30:58,244 --> 01:31:00,203
Today, I tested the machine...

1155
01:31:00,371 --> 01:31:04,833
...taking precautions in case Tesla
hadn't ironed out the kinks in its operation.

1156
01:31:05,001 --> 01:31:09,838
I mean, if it went wrong,
I would not wanna live like that for long.

1157
01:31:28,483 --> 01:31:32,527
But here at the Turn,
I must leave you, Borden.

1158
01:31:32,695 --> 01:31:34,863
Yes, you, Borden.

1159
01:31:35,031 --> 01:31:37,240
Sitting there in your cell...

1160
01:31:37,408 --> 01:31:41,453
...reading my diary, awaiting your death...

1161
01:31:41,621 --> 01:31:43,705
...for my murder.

1162
01:31:48,878 --> 01:31:52,088
Angier's journal, that gesture
of good faith, that's a fake.

1163
01:31:52,256 --> 01:31:56,259
I assure you, it's not. The provenance
of the journal is clear and under no doubt.

1164
01:31:56,427 --> 01:32:00,972
And it's written in Angier's own hand,
of which we had numerous examples.

1165
01:32:02,934 --> 01:32:04,726
It don't matter.

1166
01:32:06,771 --> 01:32:09,689
So my tricks.

1167
01:32:12,068 --> 01:32:15,737
- All of them.
- Including The Transported Man?

1168
01:32:16,572 --> 01:32:18,865
Well, Lord Caldlow
will be very pleased indeed.

1169
01:32:19,033 --> 01:32:22,536
No, he won't.
Because they're not complete.

1170
01:32:22,703 --> 01:32:25,288
It's just the Pledge
and the Turn for each.

1171
01:32:25,456 --> 01:32:28,083
Without the Prestige for these tricks...

1172
01:32:28,668 --> 01:32:31,002
...these are worthless.
- Yeah.

1173
01:32:31,671 --> 01:32:35,131
You get the rest of it
when you bring my daughter here.

1174
01:32:38,010 --> 01:32:40,095
I wanna say goodbye.

1175
01:32:41,973 --> 01:32:43,306
We have to go through it now.

1176
01:32:43,474 --> 01:32:46,017
Listen, we have to go through it now.
Now, listen to me.

1177
01:32:46,185 --> 01:32:47,477
Deny it all you want.

1178
01:32:47,645 --> 01:32:49,938
Olivia means nothing.

1179
01:32:50,106 --> 01:32:51,481
- Olivia?
- I need an assistant.

1180
01:32:51,649 --> 01:32:52,774
No, I'll go to her.

1181
01:32:52,942 --> 01:32:54,693
- I'll tell her I know...
- Tell her what?

1182
01:32:54,860 --> 01:32:58,530
I know what you really are, Alfred. I...

1183
01:32:58,990 --> 01:33:00,949
- I know, and I...
- Sarah, Sarah.

1184
01:33:01,117 --> 01:33:03,368
- I can't keep it in.
- You can't talk like this.

1185
01:33:03,536 --> 01:33:04,536
Sarah, shut up.

1186
01:33:04,704 --> 01:33:05,996
- No, no.
- Sarah, shut up!

1187
01:33:06,330 --> 01:33:07,998
I don't wanna hear it anymore!

1188
01:33:08,165 --> 01:33:11,167
You can't talk like this!

1189
01:33:12,878 --> 01:33:15,964
You can't hide it anymore
because I know, Alfred, I know.

1190
01:33:16,132 --> 01:33:17,841
I know what you really are!

1191
01:33:18,009 --> 01:33:19,676
Alfred...

1192
01:33:19,844 --> 01:33:22,554
...I can't live like this.

1193
01:33:22,722 --> 01:33:24,681
Oh, well, you think I can live like this?

1194
01:33:24,849 --> 01:33:28,018
You think I bloody enjoy living like this?

1195
01:33:28,185 --> 01:33:30,770
- Stop it and listen! No!
- We have this beautiful house...

1196
01:33:30,938 --> 01:33:34,190
...lovely little girl, we're married.
What is so wrong with your life?

1197
01:33:34,358 --> 01:33:36,860
Alfred, I can't live like this!

1198
01:33:37,153 --> 01:33:39,904
Well, what do you want from me?

1199
01:33:44,535 --> 01:33:46,202
I want...

1200
01:33:46,370 --> 01:33:49,497
I want you to be honest with me.

1201
01:33:52,376 --> 01:33:54,210
No tricks...

1202
01:33:54,879 --> 01:33:58,256
...no lies...

1203
01:33:58,507 --> 01:34:01,676
...and no secrets.

1204
01:34:07,266 --> 01:34:10,602
Do you...? Do you love me?

1205
01:34:13,439 --> 01:34:15,190
Not today.

1206
01:34:17,234 --> 01:34:18,234
No.

1207
01:35:56,167 --> 01:35:58,168
Who's there?

1208
01:36:00,296 --> 01:36:02,088
I'm looking for an old friend.

1209
01:36:02,256 --> 01:36:03,381
I heard about a booking.

1210
01:36:04,175 --> 01:36:06,885
Nice little theater.
Good up-and-coming magician.

1211
01:36:07,052 --> 01:36:09,345
- You're back.
- It's good to see you, John.

1212
01:36:10,306 --> 01:36:12,891
Good rehearsal space.

1213
01:36:13,058 --> 01:36:15,685
Blind stagehands, I like it.

1214
01:36:15,853 --> 01:36:18,313
You always had
a good eye for publicity.

1215
01:36:18,481 --> 01:36:19,856
I need your help, John.

1216
01:36:20,357 --> 01:36:22,692
It's my last show. A limited engagement.

1217
01:36:23,152 --> 01:36:24,402
Your last show?

1218
01:36:24,945 --> 01:36:28,406
A wise man once told me
obsession was a young man's game.

1219
01:36:28,574 --> 01:36:29,574
I'm almost done.

1220
01:36:30,534 --> 01:36:32,327
There's one thing left.

1221
01:36:33,370 --> 01:36:35,747
The Real Transported Man.

1222
01:36:37,666 --> 01:36:39,584
You wanna design a show around it.

1223
01:36:39,752 --> 01:36:42,545
I don't want you backstage.
I need you front of house, managing.

1224
01:36:42,713 --> 01:36:45,256
I need you to call in favors
or connections you have...

1225
01:36:45,424 --> 01:36:49,010
...to get us the right booking for the run.
- What sort of booking you after?

1226
01:36:49,178 --> 01:36:51,387
The sort that Borden can't ignore.

1227
01:36:59,438 --> 01:37:01,523
What an honor it is to see you again, sir.

1228
01:37:01,690 --> 01:37:05,026
You told me you only wanted to show me
one trick. It piqued my interest.

1229
01:37:05,194 --> 01:37:08,238
- It's a very clever trick, Mr. Ackerman.
- Pleased to meet you.

1230
01:37:08,405 --> 01:37:11,241
Likewise, I'm sure.
Well, let's get on, shall we?

1231
01:37:15,079 --> 01:37:17,080
Turn it on, gentlemen.

1232
01:37:21,961 --> 01:37:23,044
Very pretty.

1233
01:37:34,223 --> 01:37:37,642
That's it, Cutter? He simply disappears?

1234
01:37:37,810 --> 01:37:40,645
That's not a trick.
Well, he has to come back.

1235
01:37:40,813 --> 01:37:41,896
There has to be a...

1236
01:37:42,064 --> 01:37:43,481
- A Prestige?
- Exactly.

1237
01:37:46,652 --> 01:37:48,444
Pardon me.

1238
01:37:49,238 --> 01:37:51,656
It's very rare to see...

1239
01:37:52,616 --> 01:37:54,534
...real magic.

1240
01:37:55,327 --> 01:37:58,997
- Yes, it's been many years since I've seen...
- Are you interested in helping us?

1241
01:38:01,208 --> 01:38:02,667
Yes.

1242
01:38:03,294 --> 01:38:05,628
But you'll have to dress it up a little.

1243
01:38:07,256 --> 01:38:08,923
Disguise it.

1244
01:38:10,467 --> 01:38:12,969
Give them enough reason to doubt it.

1245
01:38:13,804 --> 01:38:17,015
You haven't spoken about her, Freddy.
Not once.

1246
01:38:17,182 --> 01:38:20,810
Why would I talk about her to you?

1247
01:38:20,978 --> 01:38:23,354
Because she was a part of your life.

1248
01:38:23,522 --> 01:38:24,689
And now she's gone.

1249
01:38:27,610 --> 01:38:31,905
You know, the day before she killed herself,
she said she wanted to meet me.

1250
01:38:32,197 --> 01:38:35,158
That she had something
to tell me about you.

1251
01:38:35,326 --> 01:38:38,661
I was such a coward,
I couldn't bring myself to face her.

1252
01:38:38,829 --> 01:38:40,496
But...

1253
01:38:41,707 --> 01:38:43,875
...what would she have said?

1254
01:38:44,043 --> 01:38:46,961
You wanna know the truth about me?

1255
01:38:48,088 --> 01:38:51,591
Truth is that...

1256
01:38:53,010 --> 01:38:55,011
...I never loved Sarah.

1257
01:38:56,680 --> 01:38:57,680
I never loved her.

1258
01:38:57,848 --> 01:39:01,184
- You married her. You had a child with her.
- Yes, yes. Part of me.

1259
01:39:01,352 --> 01:39:05,063
Part of me did, but the other part didn't.

1260
01:39:05,230 --> 01:39:08,566
The part that found you.
The part that's sitting here right now.

1261
01:39:09,693 --> 01:39:10,693
I love you.

1262
01:39:11,195 --> 01:39:14,572
No, Olivia, I love you. That's the truth.

1263
01:39:14,740 --> 01:39:17,158
That is the truth that matters.

1264
01:39:17,326 --> 01:39:21,537
You could be in some other restaurant
with some other woman right now...

1265
01:39:21,705 --> 01:39:23,331
...talking about me that way.

1266
01:39:23,499 --> 01:39:25,500
- No.
- Yes.

1267
01:39:28,879 --> 01:39:33,633
It's inhuman to be so cold.

1268
01:39:38,806 --> 01:39:42,600
He's back. After two years.

1269
01:39:42,768 --> 01:39:46,437
He's got a new trick. They're saying
it's the best London's ever seen.

1270
01:39:48,774 --> 01:39:52,193
You should see the look
on your face, Professor.

1271
01:39:53,153 --> 01:39:55,029
You should go to him.

1272
01:39:55,197 --> 01:39:57,573
You two deserve each other.

1273
01:40:02,663 --> 01:40:06,457
I'm afraid I'm booked. The Moscow Ballet,
they'll be playing through next year.

1274
01:40:06,625 --> 01:40:09,252
Then get rid of them.
There'll be a hundred performances.

1275
01:40:09,420 --> 01:40:11,087
No more, no less.

1276
01:40:11,255 --> 01:40:13,715
Five performances a week. No matinees.

1277
01:40:15,592 --> 01:40:18,553
And that's what you'll be charging
for each ticket. Good day.

1278
01:40:41,326 --> 01:40:43,828
Ladies and gentlemen,
my first trick of the evening...

1279
01:40:43,996 --> 01:40:46,664
...is one that involves considerable risk.

1280
01:40:47,124 --> 01:40:49,876
Anyone in the audience
who would be irrevocably damaged...

1281
01:40:50,044 --> 01:40:53,087
...by seeing a man drown
should leave now.

1282
01:40:53,255 --> 01:40:56,215
For when I tell you the young lady
who taught me this illusion...

1283
01:40:56,383 --> 01:40:57,967
...actually died performing it...

1284
01:40:58,135 --> 01:41:01,345
...you will understand the seriousness
of the dangers involved.

1285
01:41:03,599 --> 01:41:05,308
Let's begin.

1286
01:41:15,694 --> 01:41:19,072
In my travels, I have seen the future...

1287
01:41:20,199 --> 01:41:23,034
...and it is a strange future indeed.

1288
01:41:23,744 --> 01:41:25,828
The world, ladies and gentlemen...

1289
01:41:25,996 --> 01:41:31,292
...is on the brink of new
and terrifying possibilities.

1290
01:41:50,562 --> 01:41:55,024
What you're about to witness
is not magic.

1291
01:41:55,192 --> 01:41:56,651
It is purely science.

1292
01:41:57,027 --> 01:41:59,445
I would like to invite you
to come up on-stage now...

1293
01:41:59,613 --> 01:42:02,532
...so that you can examine the machine
for yourselves.

1294
01:42:58,005 --> 01:43:01,174
Man's reach exceeds his imagination.

1295
01:43:01,341 --> 01:43:02,550
Bravo!

1296
01:43:05,512 --> 01:43:08,097
Bravo! Bravo!

1297
01:43:12,561 --> 01:43:15,104
Bravo. Bravo.

1298
01:43:23,363 --> 01:43:25,031
One hundred performances.

1299
01:43:25,199 --> 01:43:27,491
Why? Does his method dictate that?

1300
01:43:27,659 --> 01:43:29,577
Is it a publicity move? What is it?

1301
01:43:29,745 --> 01:43:32,121
He's a no-talent magician,
and they're calling him...

1302
01:43:32,289 --> 01:43:34,415
...the bloody best in England. Why?

1303
01:43:34,625 --> 01:43:37,293
Fifty yards in a second. In a second!

1304
01:43:37,461 --> 01:43:40,421
And all that we know
is he uses a trap door.

1305
01:43:40,589 --> 01:43:44,175
Brilliant. What is going on
under that stage?

1306
01:43:44,968 --> 01:43:47,762
Why can't you outthink him?

1307
01:44:02,486 --> 01:44:03,986
They do this every night?

1308
01:44:04,154 --> 01:44:07,323
After each performance, yeah?

1309
01:44:37,729 --> 01:44:39,355
We're done.

1310
01:44:40,524 --> 01:44:41,941
All right?

1311
01:44:43,360 --> 01:44:45,027
Let him have his trick.

1312
01:44:45,195 --> 01:44:47,613
I don't need... I don't need his secret.

1313
01:44:47,781 --> 01:44:49,365
So...

1314
01:44:50,701 --> 01:44:53,577
...don't go back there,
you leave him alone.

1315
01:44:53,787 --> 01:44:56,956
Both of us, just leave him alone.

1316
01:44:57,124 --> 01:44:58,582
We're done.

1317
01:45:07,551 --> 01:45:09,510
I told you, John...

1318
01:45:09,678 --> 01:45:11,595
...I don't want you backstage
on this one.

1319
01:45:13,473 --> 01:45:15,891
I would like to invite you
to come up on-stage now...

1320
01:45:16,059 --> 01:45:19,103
...so that you can examine the machine
for yourselves.

1321
01:45:47,591 --> 01:45:51,594
- Hey, you, where do you think you're going?
- I'm part of the bloody act, you fool.

1322
01:46:00,645 --> 01:46:02,438
Who was that?

1323
01:46:58,995 --> 01:46:59,995
Hey!

1324
01:47:00,163 --> 01:47:03,666
Where's the bloody key?
Where's the bloody key?

1325
01:47:03,875 --> 01:47:06,127
The blind man's got it!

1326
01:47:06,294 --> 01:47:09,839
Where's the bloody key?
Bloody drowning!

1327
01:47:19,224 --> 01:47:21,183
Hold on!

1328
01:47:25,605 --> 01:47:26,856
What have you done?

1329
01:47:48,795 --> 01:47:54,133
Alfred Borden, you have been found guilty
of the murder of Robert Angier.

1330
01:47:54,301 --> 01:47:57,928
You will be hanged by the neck
until dead.

1331
01:47:58,722 --> 01:48:01,724
May the Lord have mercy on your soul.

1332
01:48:03,351 --> 01:48:05,144
Mr. Cutter?

1333
01:48:05,896 --> 01:48:07,188
Owens.

1334
01:48:07,898 --> 01:48:10,065
Oh, thank you for coming, Mr. Owens.

1335
01:48:10,233 --> 01:48:14,528
It has fallen to me to dispose
of Mr. Angier's equipment.

1336
01:48:14,696 --> 01:48:16,280
But I noticed from this manifest...

1337
01:48:16,448 --> 01:48:19,909
...that Lord Caldlow
has purchased the bulk of the items.

1338
01:48:20,076 --> 01:48:24,038
Mr. Cutter, if you needed to know
where to deliver these items, surely you...

1339
01:48:24,206 --> 01:48:27,500
No, no. It's just
there is one particular item...

1340
01:48:27,667 --> 01:48:31,712
...this item, in fact, that I would like to...

1341
01:48:31,880 --> 01:48:33,881
- You would like to...?
- Buy.

1342
01:48:34,049 --> 01:48:35,966
- Buy yourself?
- Yeah, I suppose so.

1343
01:48:37,219 --> 01:48:39,136
- This is the machine?
- Yes.

1344
01:48:39,304 --> 01:48:43,766
Well, I'm afraid Lord Caldlow was adamant
about purchasing this particular item.

1345
01:48:44,226 --> 01:48:46,936
Do you think I could talk
to Lord Caldlow in person?

1346
01:48:47,354 --> 01:48:49,772
Out of the question, I'm afraid.

1347
01:48:52,275 --> 01:48:54,068
Of course...

1348
01:48:54,236 --> 01:48:57,112
...I suppose if, in the course
of your delivery arrangements...

1349
01:48:57,280 --> 01:48:59,740
...your paths were to cross...

1350
01:49:00,158 --> 01:49:04,078
...I can't stop you speaking your mind.
- Thank you.

1351
01:49:05,580 --> 01:49:07,790
- Still here, Borden?
- For now.

1352
01:49:08,500 --> 01:49:09,792
Got a visitor.

1353
01:49:09,960 --> 01:49:11,335
Lord Caldlow.

1354
01:49:11,503 --> 01:49:13,587
With a little girl.

1355
01:49:22,097 --> 01:49:23,681
Jess?

1356
01:49:23,848 --> 01:49:25,349
Hello, my love.

1357
01:49:26,059 --> 01:49:28,936
How are you? I've missed you so much.

1358
01:49:29,104 --> 01:49:31,146
And Fallon's missed you too.
We both have.

1359
01:49:31,314 --> 01:49:33,524
Daddy, can I come in there?

1360
01:49:34,317 --> 01:49:36,652
Not right now. Not right now, darling.

1361
01:49:36,820 --> 01:49:40,364
No, but everything is gonna be all right.

1362
01:49:40,824 --> 01:49:43,492
- You must be Lord Caldlow.
- Caldlow.

1363
01:49:43,827 --> 01:49:44,952
Yes, I am.

1364
01:49:45,120 --> 01:49:46,287
I always have been.

1365
01:49:51,334 --> 01:49:53,502
They flatter you
with all those chains, Alfred.

1366
01:49:53,670 --> 01:49:56,630
Don't they know you can't escape
without your little rubber ball?

1367
01:49:56,798 --> 01:49:57,923
I pulled you out.

1368
01:49:58,091 --> 01:49:59,633
Out of that tank.

1369
01:49:59,801 --> 01:50:03,470
All I wanted to do was prove
that I was a better magician...

1370
01:50:03,638 --> 01:50:05,514
...but you couldn't leave me alone.

1371
01:50:07,183 --> 01:50:09,351
I don't know what you've done...

1372
01:50:11,229 --> 01:50:14,732
...but you're not afraid
to get your hands dirty anymore, are you?

1373
01:50:14,899 --> 01:50:16,734
No, not anymore.

1374
01:50:16,901 --> 01:50:18,152
And I win.

1375
01:50:18,320 --> 01:50:21,530
Because no one cares about the man
in the box, the man who disappears.

1376
01:50:21,698 --> 01:50:22,698
You win?

1377
01:50:24,200 --> 01:50:28,621
This ain't a bloody competition anymore,
Angier, this is my little girl's life.

1378
01:50:28,788 --> 01:50:31,874
And don't you dare put her
in the middle of this.

1379
01:50:32,042 --> 01:50:34,877
Oh, I know how hard it is
to have someone so special...

1380
01:50:35,045 --> 01:50:37,671
...taken away from me, don't I, Borden?

1381
01:50:38,506 --> 01:50:41,133
And you can't take her with you now,
can you?

1382
01:50:41,301 --> 01:50:43,052
Oh, she'll be looked after.

1383
01:50:43,595 --> 01:50:47,723
- Goodbye, Professor. Come on, darling.
- No, no, no. Stop, stop, stop. Look.

1384
01:50:47,891 --> 01:50:49,224
Here.

1385
01:50:50,685 --> 01:50:52,394
That's what you're after.

1386
01:50:52,562 --> 01:50:54,688
That's what this is about.

1387
01:50:54,856 --> 01:50:56,106
Take it.

1388
01:50:56,274 --> 01:50:58,233
- Your secret?
- Yeah.

1389
01:51:01,237 --> 01:51:03,614
You always were the better magician.

1390
01:51:03,782 --> 01:51:05,282
We both know that.

1391
01:51:05,450 --> 01:51:09,161
But whatever your secret was,
I mean, you have to agree...

1392
01:51:09,412 --> 01:51:10,412
...mine is better.

1393
01:51:12,332 --> 01:51:15,542
Don't do this. Don't do this, Angier, no.
Jess, Jess, Jess.

1394
01:51:15,919 --> 01:51:19,088
Jess, I'm gonna take you home soon.
I promise.

1395
01:51:19,464 --> 01:51:21,757
- For God's sake, Borden.
- I promise. Look.

1396
01:51:25,720 --> 01:51:27,096
I promise.

1397
01:51:27,263 --> 01:51:30,933
- I love you, Jess. I love you.
- Come on.

1398
01:51:31,101 --> 01:51:34,269
- Come on. Come on.
- I love you. I love you, Jess.

1399
01:51:34,437 --> 01:51:36,772
Angier. Angier!

1400
01:51:36,940 --> 01:51:38,941
What, you think this place can hold me?

1401
01:51:39,109 --> 01:51:41,985
Angier! They're gonna bloody hang me!

1402
01:51:42,153 --> 01:51:45,280
They're gonna bloody hang me!
You can put a stop to this now!

1403
01:51:45,448 --> 01:51:47,533
- Listen! Listen! That man...!
- Just shut up.

1404
01:51:47,701 --> 01:51:50,119
Listen, that man is the one
I'm meant to have killed!

1405
01:51:50,286 --> 01:51:52,246
You blind bastard, listen to me!

1406
01:51:52,414 --> 01:51:54,331
- If he's alive, I'm not guilty!
- Guards!

1407
01:51:54,499 --> 01:51:56,667
- I'm not guilty!
- I don't care! Get hold of him!

1408
01:51:56,835 --> 01:51:58,836
- Goodbye, Professor.
- Angier!

1409
01:52:03,591 --> 01:52:05,300
Run along now.

1410
01:52:06,261 --> 01:52:09,763
Sir. There's a gentleman waiting.

1411
01:52:25,613 --> 01:52:26,655
Dear God.

1412
01:52:27,449 --> 01:52:29,116
Hello, Cutter.

1413
01:52:29,701 --> 01:52:31,618
You're... You're still alive.

1414
01:52:31,786 --> 01:52:33,537
How is it you're still alive, Robert?

1415
01:52:33,788 --> 01:52:36,081
I saw you on a slab, for God's sake.

1416
01:52:39,335 --> 01:52:41,128
- Child.
- Good night, sir.

1417
01:52:41,296 --> 01:52:42,796
Good night, Jess.

1418
01:52:44,591 --> 01:52:46,091
I've seen her before.

1419
01:52:46,259 --> 01:52:51,555
I saw her in court with Fallon.

1420
01:52:53,433 --> 01:52:55,934
- What have you done?
- Well, she needs looking after.

1421
01:52:56,102 --> 01:52:58,353
She needs her father.

1422
01:52:58,772 --> 01:53:01,523
You're letting him hang,
and I helped you.

1423
01:53:01,691 --> 01:53:07,571
I came here to beg Lord Caldlow
to let me destroy that machine.

1424
01:53:08,114 --> 01:53:11,366
I am not gonna beg you for anything.

1425
01:53:11,534 --> 01:53:14,787
You don't have to. I'm gonna make sure
that machine's never used again.

1426
01:53:15,955 --> 01:53:20,209
Then, Lord Caldlow...

1427
01:53:21,711 --> 01:53:23,629
...where do you want me to deliver it?

1428
01:53:23,797 --> 01:53:25,172
My theater.

1429
01:53:25,340 --> 01:53:27,466
It belongs with the Prestige materials.

1430
01:53:28,092 --> 01:53:30,594
John, I tried not to involve you.

1431
01:53:43,566 --> 01:53:45,442
So...

1432
01:53:47,779 --> 01:53:49,863
...we go alone now.

1433
01:53:50,532 --> 01:53:52,407
Both of us.

1434
01:53:55,829 --> 01:53:59,248
Only I don't have as far to go as you.

1435
01:54:04,504 --> 01:54:06,171
No.

1436
01:54:07,298 --> 01:54:10,676
You were right, I should have left him
to his damn trick.

1437
01:54:12,220 --> 01:54:13,971
I'm sorry.

1438
01:54:15,765 --> 01:54:18,141
I'm sorry for a lot of things.

1439
01:54:19,269 --> 01:54:21,436
I'm sorry about Sarah.

1440
01:54:23,106 --> 01:54:24,815
I didn't mean to hurt her.

1441
01:54:24,983 --> 01:54:26,942
I didn't.

1442
01:54:28,486 --> 01:54:31,196
You go live your life in full now, all right?

1443
01:54:31,364 --> 01:54:32,906
You live for both of us.

1444
01:54:41,624 --> 01:54:43,166
Goodbye.

1445
01:55:29,464 --> 01:55:31,256
Are you watching closely?

1446
01:56:02,705 --> 01:56:04,706
Put it down the end.

1447
01:56:38,282 --> 01:56:42,452
Take a minute to consider
your achievement.

1448
01:56:42,870 --> 01:56:48,000
I once told you about a sailor
who described drowning to me.

1449
01:56:48,167 --> 01:56:50,252
Yes, he said it was like going home.

1450
01:56:51,295 --> 01:56:56,216
I was lying. He said it was agony.

1451
01:57:34,964 --> 01:57:36,923
Alfred Borden...

1452
01:57:37,300 --> 01:57:41,053
...this day, in the name of the king
and the High Court of England...

1453
01:57:41,220 --> 01:57:43,472
...you will meet your end.

1454
01:57:45,141 --> 01:57:48,060
No one cares about the man in the box.

1455
01:57:52,148 --> 01:58:00,072
Cutter?

1456
01:58:01,866 --> 01:58:05,285
Do you have anything to say?

1457
01:58:08,831 --> 01:58:10,290
Abracadabra.

1458
01:58:46,911 --> 01:58:48,662
A brother.

1459
01:58:48,830 --> 01:58:50,163
A twin.

1460
01:58:51,332 --> 01:58:56,628
You were Fallon the whole time.

1461
01:58:56,796 --> 01:58:57,921
No.

1462
01:58:58,923 --> 01:59:01,299
We were both Fallon.

1463
01:59:01,467 --> 01:59:02,551
And we were both Borden.

1464
01:59:08,724 --> 01:59:11,643
Were you...? Were you the one
who went into the box...

1465
01:59:11,811 --> 01:59:13,603
...or the one who came back out?

1466
01:59:14,897 --> 01:59:16,982
We took turns.

1467
01:59:21,863 --> 01:59:23,864
The trick is where we would swap.

1468
01:59:30,163 --> 01:59:34,624
Cutter knew. Cutter knew.
But I told him it was too simple, too easy.

1469
01:59:35,793 --> 01:59:37,419
No.

1470
01:59:38,171 --> 01:59:40,046
Simple maybe, but not easy.

1471
01:59:40,423 --> 01:59:43,967
There's nothing easy
about two men sharing one life.

1472
01:59:49,640 --> 01:59:51,808
I don't understand
how it can be bleeding again.

1473
01:59:56,814 --> 01:59:58,982
What about Olivia? And your wife?

1474
01:59:59,942 --> 02:00:01,902
We each loved one of them.

1475
02:00:05,615 --> 02:00:07,616
I loVed Sarah.

1476
02:00:08,659 --> 02:00:10,911
He loVed OliVia.

1477
02:00:11,370 --> 02:00:16,499
We each had half of a full life, really,
which was enough for us.

1478
02:00:16,667 --> 02:00:18,460
Just.

1479
02:00:20,213 --> 02:00:22,047
But not for them.

1480
02:00:24,675 --> 02:00:29,387
See, sacrifice, Robert,
that's the price of a good trick.

1481
02:00:31,891 --> 02:00:34,643
But you wouldn't know
anything about that, would you?

1482
02:00:38,147 --> 02:00:39,439
I've made sacrifices.

1483
02:00:39,607 --> 02:00:41,358
- No.
- Yes.

1484
02:00:41,984 --> 02:00:44,945
It takes nothing
to steal another man's work.

1485
02:00:46,155 --> 02:00:47,739
It takes everything.

1486
02:01:07,843 --> 02:01:10,845
No. No.
No, wait! I'm the...!

1487
02:01:17,019 --> 02:01:19,145
It took courage.

1488
02:01:21,357 --> 02:01:24,484
It took courage to climb
into that machine every night...

1489
02:01:25,319 --> 02:01:30,282
...not knowing
if I'd be the man in the box...

1490
02:01:33,202 --> 02:01:34,202
...or in the Prestige.

1491
02:01:36,038 --> 02:01:40,667
Do you wanna...?
Do you wanna see what it cost me?

1492
02:01:41,127 --> 02:01:44,254
You didn't see where you are, did you?

1493
02:01:44,880 --> 02:01:47,048
Look. Look.

1494
02:01:48,092 --> 02:01:50,176
I don't care.

1495
02:01:54,473 --> 02:01:57,100
You went halfway around the world.

1496
02:01:58,102 --> 02:02:01,062
You spent a fortune.

1497
02:02:02,898 --> 02:02:05,233
You did terrible things.

1498
02:02:06,402 --> 02:02:09,237
Really terrible things, Robert.

1499
02:02:10,990 --> 02:02:12,407
And all for nothing.

1500
02:02:13,659 --> 02:02:16,369
- For nothing?
- Yeah.

1501
02:02:19,749 --> 02:02:24,502
You never understood why we did this.

1502
02:02:27,423 --> 02:02:30,675
The audience knows the truth.

1503
02:02:31,260 --> 02:02:35,263
The world is simple. It's miserable.

1504
02:02:37,058 --> 02:02:39,559
Solid all the way through.

1505
02:02:41,479 --> 02:02:46,066
But if you could fool them,
even for a second...

1506
02:02:47,610 --> 02:02:50,320
...then you could make them wonder.

1507
02:02:51,155 --> 02:02:52,989
And then you...

1508
02:02:53,449 --> 02:02:57,911
Then you got to see something
very special.

1509
02:03:01,791 --> 02:03:04,042
You really don't know?

1510
02:03:07,713 --> 02:03:13,009
It was... It was the look on their faces.

1511
02:03:28,192 --> 02:03:33,196
Every magic trick consists
of three parts or acts.

1512
02:03:36,492 --> 02:03:39,702
The first part is called the Pledge.

1513
02:03:40,121 --> 02:03:42,789
The magician shows you
something ordinary.

1514
02:03:43,958 --> 02:03:47,669
The second act is called the Turn.

1515
02:03:47,920 --> 02:03:51,005
The magician takes
the ordinary something...

1516
02:03:51,173 --> 02:03:54,134
...and makes it into
something extraordinary.

1517
02:03:55,428 --> 02:03:57,178
But you wouldn't clap yet...

1518
02:03:57,346 --> 02:04:00,432
...because making something disappear
isn't enough.

1519
02:04:01,058 --> 02:04:04,561
You have to bring it back.

1520
02:04:08,315 --> 02:04:09,983
Hey.

1521
02:04:37,970 --> 02:04:41,055
Now you're looking for the secret.

1522
02:04:43,309 --> 02:04:48,229
But you won't find it because,
of course, you're not really looking.

1523
02:04:50,232 --> 02:04:53,318
You don't really want to work it out.

1524
02:04:56,405 --> 02:04:58,698
You want to be fooled.

1525
02:10:22,397 --> 02:10:24,398
