1
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:23,599
In May 1980, Fidel Castro opened
the harbor at Mariel, Cuba,

2
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,434
with the apparent intention
of letting some of his people

3
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,557
join their relatives
in the United States.

4
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,792
Within seventy-two hours, 3,000
U.S. Boats were headed for Cuba.

5
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,997
It soon became evident that Castro
was forcing the boat owners

6
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:41,152
to carry back with them
not only their relatives

7
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,754
but the dregs of his jails.

8
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,877
Of the 125,000 refugees
that landed in Florida,

9
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,111
an estimated 25,000
had criminal records.

10
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,277
...they are unwilling to adapt
to the spirit of our revolution.

11
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,476
We don't want them!
We don't need them!

12
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,512
MARIEL HARBOUR, CUBA

13
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,198
What do you call yourself?

14
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,471
Antonio Montana.
And you, what you call yourself?

15
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,752
Where'd you learn English, Tony?
In school.

16
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,000
And my father,
he was from the United States.

17
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,438
Just like you, you know?

18
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,639
He was a Yankee.

19
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,117
He used to take me a lot
to the movies.

20
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,235
I learned.

21
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:54,995
I watch the guys
like Humphrey Bogart, James Cagney.

22
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,154
They teach me to talk.
I like those guys.

23
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,630
I always know one day
I'm coming here, United States.

24
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,309
So where's your old man now?
He dead. He die.

25
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,516
Sometime. Somewhere.

26
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,716
Mother?
She dead, too.

27
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,832
What work you do in Cuba?
You know, things.

28
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,832
I was this, that.

29
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,199
Construction business.

30
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,798
I work a lot with my hands.
I was in the Army.

31
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,918
Any family in the States?
Cousins, brother-in-law?

32
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,992
Nobody. Everybody's dead.

33
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,038
You ever been to jail, Tony?

34
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,669
Me? Jail? No way, no.

35
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,198
Been in a mental hospital?
Yeah. On the boat coming over.

36
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,472
What about homosexuality, Tony?
You like men?

37
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,074
<i>You like to dress up like a woman?</i>

38
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:50,108
What is wrong with this guy?
He kidding me or what?

39
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,350
Just answer the questions, Tony.

40
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,551
Okay. No.

41
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,709
<i>Fuck, no.</i>

42
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,431
Arrested for vagrancy? Marijuana?

43
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,079
Never, man.
Heroin?

44
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,515
Cocaine?
No.

45
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,397
Where'd you get the beauty
scar, tough guy? Eating pussy?

46
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,951
How am I gonna get a scar like that
eating pussy?

47
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,995
This was when I was a kid, you know?

48
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,112
You should see the other kid.
You can't recognize him.

49
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,349
And this?

50
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,509
What? That's nothing.
That's from my sweetheart.

51
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,956
Sweetheart, my ass! We've
been seeing more and more of these.

52
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,589
<i>Some kind of code
these guys used in the can.</i>

53
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,069
<i>Pitchfork means an assassin
or something.</i>

54
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,593
<i>You want to tell us about it...</i>

55
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,513
<i>or you want to take a trip
to the detention centre?</i>

56
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,395
Okay, you got me.

57
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,235
I was in the can one time.
For buying dollars. Big deal.

58
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,510
That's pretty funny, Tony.
That's true.

59
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,352
It was a Canadian tourist.

60
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,590
Did you mug him first?
Get him out of here!

61
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,875
Come on!
So I fuck up!

62
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,157
Let me talk to this guy. Please!
Let me talk to him a minute.

63
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,514
You a Communist?

64
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,633
How'd you like it?

65
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:07,429
They tell you always what to do,
what to think, what to feel.

66
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,830
Do you want to be like a sheep?
Like all those other people?

67
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,952
I don't have to listen to this!

68
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:16,919
You wanna work 8, 10 fucking hours?
You own nothing, you got nothing!

69
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,231
<i>Do you want a chivato
on every corner...</i>

70
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,753
watching everything you do?

71
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,432
Everything you say, man?

72
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,156
You know I eat octopus
three times a day?

73
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,515
I got fucking octopus
coming out of my ears.

74
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,797
I got fucking Russian shoes,
my feet's coming through.

75
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,799
How'd you like that?

76
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,874
You want me to stay there
and do nothing?

77
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,191
<i>I'm no fucking criminal, man.
I'm no puta or thief.</i>

78
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,870
I'm Tony Montana,
a political prisoner from Cuba.

79
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,039
I want my fucking human rights, now!

80
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,032
Like President Jimmy Carter says.
Okay?

81
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,078
Carter should see this human right.
He's really good.

82
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,833
- What do you say?
- I don't believe any of this shit!

83
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:00,959
They all sound alike to me.
That Castro is shitting all over us.

84
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,838
Send the bastard to Freedom Town.
Let them see him.

85
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,911
Get him out of here.
Know something?

86
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,035
You can send me anywhere.

87
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,315
Here, there, this, that.
It don't matter.

88
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,278
There's nothing you can do to me
that Castro hasn't done...

89
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,634
Get him out of here!

90
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,031
So?
So?

91
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,351
What'd you tell them?

92
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:24,991
What you told me to tell them.
That we... I was in sanitation.

93
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,798
They didn't go for it.

94
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,110
- Sanitation?
- Yeah.

95
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:35,559
I told you to tell them you was
in a sanatarium, not sanitation.

96
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,279
- Sanatarium. Yeah.
- You didn't tell me that.

97
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,070
No, I told you to say you had TB
and you was in a sanatarium.

98
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,514
You was cured.

99
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:49,909
- When did you tell me that?
- You should've kept your mouth shut.

100
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,195
They'd think you was a horse
and let you out.

101
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:02,880
ONE MONTH LATER

102
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,517
Tony! Montana!

103
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,509
Tony Montana! Come here.

104
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,715
Come here, man. I gotta talk to you.

105
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,797
<i>Come on, man. It's important.</i>

106
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,711
So close, man.
Come on.

107
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,040
- I gotta talk to you.
- Where are you going?

108
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,270
- Leave him alone.
- I got better things to do.

109
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,476
You're chicken, man.
You almost made it.

110
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:14,074
Are you ready for some good news?

111
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,198
Sure. What you got, man?

112
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,271
We can be outta this place
in 30 days.

113
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,750
Not only that, but we got
a green card and a job in Miami.

114
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,030
Now are we made or are we made, man?

115
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,436
What do we gotta do?
Go to Cuba and hit the Beard?

116
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:30,080
- No, man, somebody else.
- You're kidding?

117
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,594
- No.
- You're not kidding?

118
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,678
Guy named Rebenga, man.
Emilio Rebenga.

119
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,875
Rebenga?

120
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,229
- I know that name.
- Yeah?

121
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,833
- He's political.
- Yeah.

122
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,556
Well, he's coming in here
today. Castro just sprung him.

123
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,350
<i>This guy was one of the top dogs
for Fidel in the early days.</i>

124
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:54,833
Castro felt he couldn't trust him
and threw him in jail.

125
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:58,118
<i>But while he was on top,
he tortured a few guys to death.</i>

126
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,397
<i>One of the guy's brothers
is a rich guy in Miami now.</i>

127
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,879
<i>He wants the favor repaid.</i>

128
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,672
That's where we come in.

129
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,436
It's ugly, man.

130
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,429
Yeah.

131
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,749
You tell your guys in Miami,
your friend...

132
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,998
it'd be a pleasure.

133
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,470
I'd kill a Communist for fun...

134
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:28,835
but for a green card,
I gonna carve him up real nice.

135
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,913
MIAMI, FLORIDA, AUGUST 11, 1980.
HUNDREDS OF CUBAN REFUGEES

136
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,679
BEGAN RIOTING THIS MORNING
AT A DETENTION CENTRE SITUATED

137
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,718
UNDER INTERSTATE 95 IN NORTH MIAMI,
BURNING TENTS AND ATTACKING

138
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,951
IMMIGRATION AND NATURALISATION
GUARDS WITH PIPES, STICKS AND ROCKS.

139
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:42,310
<i>Libertad! Libertad!</i>

140
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,759
Rebenga!

141
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,318
From a friend you fucked!

142
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,557
That face. That's nice.

143
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:04,518
- That doesn't look like me.
- That looks pretty, man.

144
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,829
Fuck!

145
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,713
Your big shot friend better
come up with something soon.

146
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,268
I didn't come to the U.S.
To break my fucking back.

147
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,669
He's coming!
What do you want from me?

148
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,754
Fucking thing!

149
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,115
I told you.

150
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,874
What's wrong?

151
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,749
Look at that one.

152
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,274
That one in the pink.
She's beautiful.

153
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,032
<i>Look at those titties.</i>

154
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,438
Look at that punk with her.

155
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,956
What's he got that I don't have?

156
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:25,037
Well, he's very handsome,
for one thing, you know?

157
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,470
I mean, look at the way he dresses.

158
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,950
Come on.
That's style, flash, pizzazz.

159
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,952
And a little coke money
doesn't hurt nobody.

160
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,234
Look at this.

161
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,594
Fucking onions.

162
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,998
They ought to be picking gold
from the street.

163
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,559
There's two guys
looking for you out there.

164
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,670
<i>That's him, man. That's El mono.
I told you.</i>

165
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,398
Don't stay too fucking long.

166
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,789
We've got a lot of work to do.

167
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,551
Waldo! Good to see you, man.

168
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,996
This is my friend, Tony Montana,
I've been telling you about.

169
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:32,311
<i>Tony, that's Omar Suarez,
and that's Waldo Rojas over there.</i>

170
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,113
I got something for you.

171
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,156
Yeah? What do we gotta do?

172
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,596
Gotta unload a boat. Marijuana.
45 tons. You get $500 each.

173
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:44,032
- $500? That's great.
- You gotta be kidding.

174
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,388
$500?

175
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,069
Who do you think we are,
baggage handlers?

176
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,993
The going rate on a boat
is $1,000 a night.

177
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,069
You know that.

178
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,868
First you gotta work
your way up to $500.

179
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,394
What I did for you in Freedom Town,
what was that?

180
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,550
That Rebenga hit
was a game of dominoes?

181
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:08,108
- That was something else.
- Shut up! Take it easy.

182
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,668
<i>What's with this dishwasher, chico?</i>

183
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:14,230
Don't he know we could've got any
space cadet to hit Rebenga cheaper?

184
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,595
- $50!
- Then why didn't you?

185
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,951
Don't call me no fucking dishwasher,
or I'll kick your monkey ass.

186
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,632
Who the fuck are you?

187
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,272
You can't do that, man!

188
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,555
The Colombians!

189
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,556
Okay, all right, big man!

190
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:36,030
You want to make some big bucks?
Let's see how tough you are.

191
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,436
You know something about cocaine?

192
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,312
You kidding me or what?

193
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:48,074
There's a bunch of Colombians
coming in Friday.

194
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,994
<i>New guys. They say they got
two keys for us, for openers.</i>

195
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:55,959
Pure coke. Hotel in Miami Beach.
I want you to go over there.

196
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,349
If it's what they say,
pay 'em and bring it back.

197
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,431
Do that, you get $5,000.

198
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,316
Go, pay them, bring it back, yeah?

199
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,670
You know how to handle
a machine gun?

200
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,796
Yeah, man. We were in the Army.

201
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:16,390
- You gonna need a couple other guys.
- That's no problem.

202
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,396
Be at Hector's Bodega
at noon Friday.

203
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,277
You get the buy money then.

204
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:27,318
If anything happens
to that buy money...

205
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,039
my boss will stick your heads
up your asses...

206
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,236
faster than a rabbit gets fucked!

207
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,719
I'm scared.

208
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,351
- You're pushing your luck.
- Don't worry.

209
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:41,432
- That was dumb.
- You worry too much.

210
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,919
You'll have a heart attack.

211
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,037
You act like that guy's
doing you a favor or something.

212
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:49,908
- What's this with the Colombians?
- What does it matter?

213
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:53,954
He says "Colombians,"
and you make these eyes...

214
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:57,032
I don't like fucking Colombians,
okay?

215
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,593
What you guys doing?

216
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,636
There's a lot of dishes
to be washed.

217
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,392
Wash 'em yourself.

218
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,629
I retire!

219
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,110
What the fuck you gonna do now?

220
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,471
- Don't come back here!
- I gotta look after my investment!

221
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:14,757
Fuck you guys!
Close the shop!

222
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,400
Look at those tits.
She's begging for it.

223
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,756
Are you fucking crazy?
She's 103 years old.

224
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,397
Not that one, man! That one!

225
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,436
Which one?
The young one.

226
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:43,193
Move the fucking car.
We're at a stop sign.

227
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,196
We're just staying loose up here.
You gotta stay loose.

228
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,714
You can't worry.
You'll have a heart attack.

229
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:56,078
Just play it cool. Miami Beach.
Miami Beach, man!

230
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,070
The money stays in the trunk
till I come out.

231
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,594
You got it? Me, nobody else. Okay.

232
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:25,589
I'm not out in 15 minutes,
something's wrong. Okay?

233
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,951
Room 9. You ready?
Sure thing.

234
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,875
Okay.
You mind leaving the door open?

235
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,030
So my brother-in-law sees
everything's okay.

236
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,031
Sure. No problem.

237
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,508
No problem.

238
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,598
Hello. This is Marta.

239
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,153
Marta, hello.

240
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,232
I am Hector.

241
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,199
And I am Tony.

242
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,749
So, Omar says you're okay.

243
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,469
Yeah? Good. Omar's okay.

244
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,635
Okay.

245
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,349
So, you got the money?

246
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,074
You got the stuff?

247
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:19,709
Sure I have the stuff,
but not right here with me now.

248
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,392
I got it close by.

249
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,749
I don't have the money either, man.

250
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,397
I have it close by, too.

251
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,395
Where?

252
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,309
In the car?

253
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:41,238
No, not in the car, man.
No?

254
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,758
How about you?
Where you have your stuff?

255
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,349
Not far.

256
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:59,350
Okay. You want me to come in?
We start over again?

257
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,319
Where you from, Tony?

258
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,597
What the fuck difference
does it make where I'm from?

259
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,359
Take it easy, man.

260
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,509
I just want to get to know
who I do business with.

261
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:16,957
You'll know me once you do business
with me and stop fucking around.

262
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,555
Okay?

263
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,638
What's the story?
Tony!

264
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:33,839
You know, Frog Face,
you just fucked yourself.

265
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,909
- You steal from me, you're dead.
- Yeah?

266
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,511
You want to give me the cash...

267
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,950
or do I kill your brother first...

268
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,273
before I kill you?

269
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,510
Why don't you try
sticking your head up your ass?

270
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,757
See if it fits.

271
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,715
Yeah? Okay.

272
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:26,232
<i>It's very important.
I understand.</i>

273
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,878
<i>Thank you.
You're welcome.</i>

274
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,837
<i>You forecasted an earthquake...</i>

275
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,115
<i>in the 3-to-4-point range
this morning.</i>

276
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,278
<i>We had an earthquake
in the 3-to-4-point range.</i>

277
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,351
<i>I'm impressed.
Thank you, sir.</i>

278
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:40,673
<i>However, isn't it
rather slender evidence...</i>

279
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,197
You have such beautiful skin.

280
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,390
I like the way you...

281
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,879
I don't know what I'm supposed
to do today, but...

282
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:28,429
<i>Antonio, mira!</i>

283
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,391
Watch what happens to your friend.

284
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,471
If you don't want this
to happen to you...

285
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,039
give me the money.

286
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,513
Come on, come on.

287
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,918
Now the leg.

288
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,116
Let's do it, man. Come on.

289
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,431
We're all gonna be all right.

290
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,957
<i>Okay, cara cicatriz.</i>

291
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:44,314
You can die, too.
It makes no difference to me.

292
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,669
<i>Last chance, pendejo!</i>

293
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,548
Fuck you!

294
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:02,428
- You okay?
- Yeah, man. It went in and out.

295
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:15,231
Okay, take him out of here, quick!

296
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,151
<i>Chi Chi! Get the yeyo.</i>

297
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,954
- Your turn.
- I kill you!

298
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,269
Die!

299
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:58,835
Hurry up! Get in! Come on. Let's go!

300
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,593
<i>Close the door!</i>

301
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:15,796
Bunch of cowboys.
Somebody fucked up.

302
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,436
<i>Yeah, well,
I'll check it out right away.</i>

303
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:22,513
You do that, Omar. You do that.

304
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,235
<i>You still got the money?
Yeah.</i>

305
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,116
<i>And I got the yeyo.</i>

306
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:31,274
<i>You got the yeyo?
Yeah, right.</i>

307
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,751
<i>Bring it here.
Fuck you.</i>

308
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,115
I'm taking it to Lopez myself.

309
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,435
Not you, me.

310
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,799
Nice fucking guy.

311
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,276
Frank Lopez. Tony Montana.

312
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,557
Tony Montana.
Mr. Lopez. It's a real pleasure.

313
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,914
You can call me Frank.

314
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,514
<i>Everybody calls me Frank.
My Little League team.</i>

315
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,074
Even the fucking prosecutors
around town...

316
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,275
they all call me Frank.

317
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,952
- Okay, Frank.
- How are you?

318
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,917
Manny Ribera.

319
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,555
- He caught one on the job.
- Went right through.

320
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,153
We heard about that.

321
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,312
Omar, he tells me great things
about you guys.

322
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,558
Well, Omar's okay.

323
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,677
Not to mention, of course,
the nice job you did for me.

324
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:45,275
- That Commie son of a bitch...
- You don't have to mention that.

325
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:48,238
- That was fun.
- That was fun?

326
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,754
- Damn right.
- That was fun.

327
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,712
Sometimes it's fun.

328
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:57,512
What do you want to drink?
Scotch, gin, rum? What do you like?

329
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,592
Gin is fine. Want some? Two gins.

330
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,838
I need a guy with steel
in his balls, Tony.

331
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:07,310
A guy like you. And I need him
around me all the time.

332
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:10,631
<i>You, Tony, and your compadre here.</i>

333
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,033
Here's the stuff.

334
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,715
Two keys.

335
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:23,550
It cost my friend Angel his life.
Here's the money.

336
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,472
My gift to you.

337
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:34,030
I'm sorry about your friend, Tony.

338
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,311
If people would do business
the right way...

339
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,868
there'd be no fuck-ups like this.

340
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,394
Don't think
I don't appreciate the gesture.

341
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:46,278
<i>You're gonna find,
you stay loyal in this business...</i>

342
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:49,557
you're gonna move up.
You're gonna move up fast.

343
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,557
And you'll find out
your biggest problem...

344
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,517
is not bringing in the stuff...

345
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:03,194
but what to do
with all the fucking cash!

346
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,071
I hope I have that problem someday.

347
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,912
You'll have that problem,
don't worry.

348
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,877
Sit down over here.

349
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,788
Where the hell's Elvira?
It's late. Go find her, will you?

350
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:18,678
Jesus! Fucking broad.

351
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:22,753
She spends half her life dressing,
the other half undressing.

352
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,276
Gotta get her in between.

353
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,110
She's coming.
Yeah.

354
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,834
You gotta jump on her
when she's not looking.

355
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,751
That's the best time.

356
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,116
What are you guys doing tonight?

357
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:41,192
You wanna go to a nice restaurant
with me? You hungry?

358
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,309
I could eat a horse.

359
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:46,312
- Okay, they'll cook you a horse.
- I'll eat it.

360
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:54,234
Tell me, where'd they get you?
Right there in the side?

361
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,595
It's nothing.
It went right through me.

362
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,669
It hit the wall.

363
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,955
I ran out of bullets
like an asshole.

364
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:03,350
<i>When I changed the clip,
a guy who I thought I killed...</i>

365
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,510
<i>wasn't dead and shot me.</i>

366
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,911
The guy was behind me. I killed him.

367
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,355
- How many bullets you catch?
- Bullets? One bullet.

368
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,668
Nine millimeter.

369
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:25,589
Elvira, where the hell you been?
It's 10:00. I'm starving.

370
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:28,797
You're always hungry.
You should try starving.

371
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,392
Where you going? Come on.

372
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:35,632
<i>Come over here!
I want you to meet a friend of mine.</i>

373
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,156
Tony Montana. Elvira.

374
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,714
- Hello.
- Manny Ribera. Elvira.

375
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,429
So, there are five of us.
Where are we having dinner?

376
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,875
I thought we'd go
to the Babylon Club.

377
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,878
- Again?
- Again.

378
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:56,157
You know, Frank, if anyone wanted
to assassinate you...

379
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,390
you wouldn't be too hard to find.

380
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:01,517
Assassinate me?
Who the hell would want to kill me?

381
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,471
I got nothing but friends!

382
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:09,314
You never know. Maybe the catcher
on your Little League team.

383
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:13,429
The catcher? That son of a bitch,
he didn't get a base hit all season.

384
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,873
<i>I should kill him!</i>

385
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,151
You know who that is?
Luis and Miguel Echevierra.

386
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,957
They got the biggest distribution
set-up from here to Houston...

387
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,235
Tucson, all down that way.

388
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,032
What do you think of that?

389
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,029
Look.

390
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:39,430
<i>You see that fat bastard?
That's Nacho Contreras.</i>

391
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,431
<i>El Gordo!</i>

392
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,273
<i>He's got more cash
than anybody in this place.</i>

393
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,868
<i>He's a real chazer!</i>

394
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,355
<i>You know what a chazer is?</i>

395
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,915
<i>No, Frank, you tell me.
What is a chazer?</i>

396
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,468
It's the Yiddish word for "pig."

397
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:03,156
A guy who wants more than he needs.
He don't fly straight no more.

398
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:08,394
So, it comes down to one thing,
Tony boy, and you never forget it.

399
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,390
Lesson Number 1:

400
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:16,519
Don't underestimate...

401
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,875
the other guy's greed!

402
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,469
Lesson Number 2:

403
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,516
Don't get high on your own supply.

404
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:27,717
That's right. Lesson Number 2:
Don't get high on your own supply.

405
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:30,234
'Course, not everybody
follows the rules.

406
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,357
Your champagne, Mr. Lopez.

407
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,079
That is '64?
The best, Mr. Lopez.

408
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:43,470
Omar, you pour it, and you bring
another bottle right away, will you?

409
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:50,513
$550 for this bottle, Tony.
What do you think of that?

410
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:54,076
- That's pretty good.
- For a bunch of fucking grapes.

411
00:35:56,600 --> 00:36:00,513
So, here's to old friends
and to new friends.

412
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,758
How you like it, Tony?

413
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,431
- That's good, Frank.
- That's good?

414
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,954
- Like you say, man.
- That's good!

415
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,713
I'm gonna get you new clothes, too.

416
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:24,598
I'm gonna get you $550 suits...

417
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,032
so you look real sharp.

418
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:30,070
'Cause I want you to work for me.

419
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:35,358
I want you and your boys
to work with Omar here.

420
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,715
We are going to do...

421
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,189
something big next month.

422
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:45,836
We are running a string of mules
from Colombia.

423
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:49,676
You do good on that,
there'll be some other things.

424
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,869
That sounds like fun to me, Frank.

425
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,473
You want a cigar?

426
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:04,393
You wanna dance, Frank,
or sit here and have a heart attack?

427
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:13,192
Who? Me, dance?
I want a heart attack instead.

428
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,277
Don't foam into the Dommie P.

429
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,509
How about you?

430
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,677
What? You want me to dance?

431
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,716
Yeah, sure. Go on, Tony. You dance.

432
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,798
Go on. Have some fun.

433
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,872
What do you think of him?

434
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,151
I think he's a fucking peasant!

435
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,914
But you get a guy like that
on your side...

436
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,595
he breaks his back for you.

437
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,550
- What's your name?
- What?

438
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:35,188
What's your name? Elvira what?

439
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,555
- Hancock.
- What?

440
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:40,109
- Hancock!
- Hancock?

441
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:44,598
Sounds like a bird. Hancock.

442
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,353
Flying around.

443
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,674
Where you from?

444
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,516
- Baltimore.
- What?

445
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,432
- Baltimore!
- Baltimore?

446
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:58,515
- Where's that?
- It doesn't really matter, okay?

447
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:02,108
I'm just trying to be friendly.

448
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,356
I don't need another friend...

449
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,670
especially one
who just got off a banana boat.

450
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,872
Banana boat?

451
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:13,555
Hold it. You got the wrong guy.
I don't come off no banana boat.

452
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,475
<i>You're thinking of someone else,
maybe.</i>

453
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,916
Aren't you part
of the Cuban crime wave?

454
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,152
What you talking crazy for?
I'm a political refugee here.

455
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,153
So take it easy. Don't talk crazy.
Sorry.

456
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:30,597
I didn't know you were so sensitive
about your diplomatic status.

457
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:33,319
What is your problem, baby?

458
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,629
<i>You're good-looking.</i>

459
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,711
<i>You got a beautiful body,
beautiful legs...</i>

460
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,155
a beautiful face,
all these guys in love with you.

461
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:40,719
Only you got a look in your eye...

462
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,360
like you haven't been fucked
in a year!

463
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,832
Hey, José.

464
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:49,071
Who, why, when and how I fuck
is none of your business, okay?

465
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:52,277
Now you're talking to me, baby.
That I like. Keep it coming.

466
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:55,352
Don't call me "baby"!
I'm not your baby.

467
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:58,474
Not yet,
but you gotta give me some time.

468
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,872
Even if I were blind, desperate...

469
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:06,190
starved and begging for it
on a desert island...

470
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:08,555
you'd be the last thing
I'd ever fuck.

471
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,638
That chick he's with...

472
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,793
Yeah?
She likes me.

473
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:20,717
She likes you? How do you know?

474
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,149
I know.

475
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:26,557
<i>The eyes, chico. They never lie.</i>

476
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:33,634
- Are you serious?
- Serious? What do you think?

477
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:36,115
That's the boss's lady, okay?

478
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:40,318
- You're gonna get us killed.
- Fuck you, man. The boss's lady.

479
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,952
That guy's soft.

480
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,399
Look in his face.

481
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:51,834
<i>The booze and the concha
tell him what to do.</i>

482
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,590
Don't fucking go crazy on me, okay?

483
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:01,189
Just remember last year at this time
we were in a fucking cage, okay?

484
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,599
You remember.

485
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,272
I'd like to forget that.

486
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:09,396
- I say be happy with what you got.
- You be happy.

487
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:14,112
- Me, I want what's coming to me.
- What's coming to you?

488
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:18,557
<i>The world, chico...</i>

489
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,791
and everything in it.

490
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:32,197
THREE MONTHS LATER

491
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:57,439
This is paradise.

492
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:01,075
This is paradise, I'm telling you.

493
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:05,638
This town's like a great big pussy
just waiting to get fucked.

494
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,429
I should've come here 10 years ago.

495
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:12,193
I'd have been a millionaire
by this time.

496
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:16,033
By this time,
I'd have had my own boat...

497
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:18,429
my own car, my own golf course.

498
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:21,353
You know what I want?
I thought of this the other day.

499
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,998
A line of blue jeans.

500
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:26,152
With my name written
on the back of chicks' asses.

501
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:28,795
How's that?

502
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,789
That sounds completely crazy to me.

503
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:34,793
Look at that. Look.

504
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:37,434
<i>You're missing the sights.
That's what you're doing.</i>

505
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,476
<i>We're missing the action.</i>

506
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:44,154
Want to have some ice cream
with my friend and me?

507
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:45,958
Get lost, greaseball!

508
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,712
- Look at that.
- Ice cream?

509
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,472
- That's right.
- You said "ice cream"?

510
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:53,632
- Girls like ice cream.
- Come on. That won't work.

511
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:55,597
You can't do it that way.

512
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:58,478
You know how you pick up chicks
in this country?

513
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:05,511
- What was that? What you just did?
- That's what you do.

514
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:08,311
- That's disgusting.
- Watch.

515
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:11,119
Look at that fucking thing.
You look like a lizard.

516
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,350
Like a bug coming out of your mouth.

517
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,310
Figures you wouldn't understand.

518
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:19,472
But the women in this country,
when you do that, they know.

519
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:22,393
- They know what?
- They understand. They go crazy.

520
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:25,715
It'll take practice,
but you gotta learn.

521
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,870
'Cause women love
when you suck the pussy.

522
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:29,154
Look at that.

523
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:36,113
She's looking at us.

524
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:42,236
- You think you can do it with her?
- I think I can.

525
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:44,999
- You want to try it with her?
- Why not?

526
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:49,351
- You gonna watch me?
- I'm looking at you. Go ahead.

527
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:50,998
- You won't do it.
- Watch this.

528
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:53,759
I'm with you, man.

529
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:55,833
I'm gonna get her.

530
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:00,830
Go ahead, Romeo! Do your thing.

531
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:03,669
- Just be quiet. Just hang back.
- Romeo!

532
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:12,874
You're looking very pretty today.
Yes, you. I've been watching you.

533
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,031
You want to see something funny?

534
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:17,156
Take a look over there.
See that man?

535
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:19,595
<i>Watch that guy.
I gotta sit down here.</i>

536
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:20,909
I gotta watch my friend.

537
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,560
He gonna stick his tongue out
to that girl.

538
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:24,999
Look at that.

539
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:27,029
You're sick!

540
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:29,236
You see what happened to him?

541
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:33,110
- If I wasn't a nice guy...
- She's too big for you.

542
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:35,078
Causing trouble like that, come on.

543
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:37,515
- Bitch! Lesbian!
- What I try to tell you?

544
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:38,953
What I try to tell you?

545
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:41,838
This country,
you gotta make the money first.

546
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:45,873
Then when you get the money,
you get the power.

547
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:49,032
Then when you get the power,
then you get the women.

548
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:51,791
That's why you gotta
make your own moves.

549
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:53,518
That's the one I rented.

550
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:57,590
No. That's her, man. There she is.

551
00:44:58,120 --> 00:44:59,189
<i>About time.</i>

552
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:02,515
Frank got held up
at the golf course.

553
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:04,079
He told me to pick you up.

554
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:07,188
<i>He said he'd meet us
at the track later.</i>

555
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:13,231
He said to bet on Ice Cream
in the first, by the way.

556
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:17,873
In that thing? You must be kidding.

557
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:22,512
What you talking about?
That's a Cadillac.

558
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:27,192
- I wouldn't be caught dead in that.
- Come on.

559
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:32,436
It's got a few years,
but it's a cream puff.

560
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:35,476
It looks like somebody's nightmare.

561
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:46,830
So, you like this better?

562
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:53,911
It's like one of them tigers
from India.

563
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:55,957
Crazy guy.
Know what he's been doing?

564
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:58,759
Dragging me to the zoo
to look at tigers.

565
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:00,518
He says he's gonna buy one.

566
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:03,034
<i>You do that
and you won't have any friends left.</i>

567
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:06,192
Not that you have any now.
You'll like that tiger, man.

568
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:09,078
You gonna drive around with a tiger
in your passenger seat?

569
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:11,515
Maybe. Some lady tiger.

570
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:17,439
- How much?
- $43,000, fully equipped.

571
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:20,830
- That all?
- Machine-gun turrets are extra.

572
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:23,838
He's a funny guy. Come here, Manny.

573
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,989
Bullet-proof this, okay?

574
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:30,071
And this here and here.

575
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:32,474
<i>And the windows.</i>

576
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:39,311
- Get me a phone with a scrambler.
- A scrambler.

577
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:41,755
And a radio with scanners...

578
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:43,751
to pick up flying saucers,
stuff like that.

579
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:45,432
Don't forget the fog lights.

580
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:49,274
In case I get caught in a swamp.
That's a good idea.

581
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:55,118
Get out of the way, lady!
I'm trying to drive here!

582
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,755
I thought you were taking me
to Frank.

583
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:06,509
We got an hour. You hungry?

584
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,872
No, but I'm bored.

585
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:12,478
Well, that figures.

586
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:17,711
Check it out, Manny, okay?
And pay the guy.

587
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,072
And you take a taxi.
Meet me at the track, okay?

588
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:22,878
Good doing business with you.

589
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:30,389
I wouldn't buy the car
if you didn't like it.

590
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:33,153
Planning on driving the girls crazy,
aren't you, Tony?

591
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:35,390
Yeah. You know who?

592
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:39,118
What would Frank say?

593
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,038
I like Frank, you know?

594
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:45,312
Only I like you better.

595
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:55,070
- You got some for me?
- Sure.

596
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:17,196
Don't get confused, Tony.
I don't fuck around with the help.

597
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:28,115
You wanna play that way with me,
I play with you.

598
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:29,389
Shit.

599
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,672
Would you kiss me if I wear the hat?

600
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:32,795
No!

601
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:37,076
Playtime is over, okay?

602
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:33,188
Mama?

603
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:37,628
Long time.

604
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:41,992
No postcards from jail?

605
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:53,515
Gina.

606
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,953
- Tony?
- Look at you.

607
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:01,239
You're beautiful.

608
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:04,559
- I didn't...
- Mama, look at those eyes.

609
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:06,916
Look at that. She looks like me.

610
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:10,393
You know the last time I saw you,
you was like that.

611
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:13,836
You looked like a little boy.
Now look at you.

612
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:19,837
I got something for you.

613
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:26,512
It's no big deal.

614
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:42,755
I never thought I'd see you again,
you know?

615
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:44,876
You think they'd keep
a guy like me down?

616
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:46,439
Well, no.

617
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:55,275
- You look so good.
- Look, open that up. Open it.

618
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:58,115
- For me?
- I think so.

619
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:02,511
It's nothing much,
you know, nothing.

620
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:08,759
See what's written on the back?

621
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:10,114
On the back?

622
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:15,674
- Always.
- "Always." It's beautiful, Tony!

623
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:19,196
Mama is still working
in the factory...

624
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:21,316
and I work part-time
in a beauty parlor.

625
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:24,358
I'm doing hair, Tony.
Do you remember Hiram Gonzalez?

626
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:27,239
His father owned that barbershop.
It's his place.

627
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:29,834
Plus I go to junior college.
Miami Dade.

628
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,912
In two more years,
I get my cosmetology license.

629
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,151
- Then I'll be making enough money...
- Surprise!

630
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:39,359
All that's over, starting today.

631
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:40,749
Why?

632
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:45,311
My kid sister don't have to work
in no beauty parlor, and Mama...

633
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:48,229
she don't have to sew in no factory.

634
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:50,556
Your son made it, Mama.

635
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:53,194
He's a success.

636
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:56,629
That's why
I didn't come around before.

637
00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:01,274
I want you to see
what a good boy I've been.

638
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:04,999
Here's $1,000.

639
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:07,153
For you, Mama.

640
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:16,796
Who did you kill for this, Antonio?

641
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:19,471
I didn't kill nobody, Mama.

642
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:21,469
No?
No.

643
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:24,317
What are you doing now?

644
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:27,838
<i>Banks, or is it still bodegas,
you and the others?</i>

645
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:30,070
No! Things are different now.

646
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:32,879
I'm working
with an anti-Castro group.

647
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:34,798
I'm an organizer now.

648
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:37,075
I get a lot
of political contributions.

649
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:39,513
Sure you do.

650
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:46,718
A gun sticking in somebody's face
is how.

651
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:51,158
You know, all we hear about
in the papers...

652
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:55,753
is animals like you
and the killings.

653
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:59,591
It's Cubans like you who are giving
a bad name to our people.

654
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:02,877
People who come here, work hard
and make a good name for themselves.

655
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:04,837
People who send their children
to school.

656
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:06,558
What are you saying?
That's your son...

657
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:09,598
Son? I wish I had one.

658
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:11,389
He's a bum.

659
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:14,199
He was a bum then
and he's a bum now.

660
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:17,838
Who do you think you are?

661
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:23,113
We haven't heard a word
from you in five years.

662
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:28,674
You suddenly show up here,
throw some money around...

663
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:31,115
and think you can get my respect.

664
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:34,319
You think you can buy me
with jewellery?

665
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:37,836
You think you can come into my house
with your hotshot clothes...

666
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:40,309
and your jail manners
and make fun of us?

667
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:44,359
- You don't know what you're saying.
- That's not the way I am, Antonio!

668
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:46,949
That is not the way
I raised Gina to be!

669
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,355
You are not going to destroy her.

670
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:54,632
I don't need your money.

671
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:58,392
I work for my living.

672
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:01,388
I don't want you
in this house anymore!

673
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:03,717
I don't want you around Gina.

674
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:07,194
So come on. Get out!

675
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:22,154
And take this lousy money with you.
It stinks.

676
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,753
Why do you have to spoil it
for everybody?

677
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:31,872
<i>I'm sorry, Tony.</i>

678
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:34,879
Okay, Mama.

679
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,433
No. Tony, wait a minute!

680
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:42,590
Don't go, please!
Gina, stay here!

681
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:44,876
No, Mama.
He's no good. Gina!

682
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:47,872
Tony, wait, please!

683
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:52,758
I'm sorry. I don't know.
Mama, ever since Papa left she's...

684
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:54,910
Forget Papa. We never had one.

685
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:57,554
I know you did some bad things
back then.

686
00:54:57,800 --> 00:55:00,394
In the Army,
I know you got into some trouble.

687
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:02,152
The Communists...

688
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:04,231
they're always trying
to tell you what to do.

689
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:07,039
- Mama doesn't understand that.
- I know.

690
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:11,068
I just... I don't know.

691
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:13,628
I just want you to know
that I don't care.

692
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:17,629
<i>It doesn't matter to me how long
you've been away, five or ten years.</i>

693
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:22,712
You're my blood, always.

694
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:24,949
I know.

695
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:38,112
- Come on. I want you to take this.
- I gotta go back in.

696
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:40,794
- No, Tony. Please.
- You need this.

697
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:42,154
What will I tell her?

698
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:43,912
Take that.
You don't tell her anything.

699
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,390
Don't tell her I gave it to you,
but give her some from time to time.

700
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:49,994
And listen, you go out yourself.

701
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:53,356
Go ahead, go out, do some things.
Have some fun.

702
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:55,590
You gotta get some fun out of life.

703
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:58,399
You gonna beat yourself to death
at 19?

704
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:00,869
A pussycat like you? Come here.

705
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:06,917
- I'll talk to you again.
- Okay.

706
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,036
Put that money away.
Don't let her see it.

707
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:10,553
I'll talk to her.

708
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:13,753
I'll talk to you.

709
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:16,835
Let's go.

710
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:20,990
She's beautiful. How come you...

711
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:27,519
Stay away from her. You hear?

712
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:29,554
She's not for you.

713
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:43,428
COCHABAMBA, BOLIVIA

714
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:58,238
So, this and my other factory,
I can guarantee production...

715
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:02,233
of 200 kilos refined
every month of the year.

716
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:04,830
The problem is,
I have no steady market.

717
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:08,196
Basically, what I'm looking for
is somebody in the States...

718
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:11,511
who can share the risk with me,
somebody who can guarantee...

719
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:15,639
to buy from me, say,
150 kilos a month.

720
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:20,157
That's a big commitment, Mr. Sosa.
Something like that...

721
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:23,430
Too bad Frank's not here.
You should talk to him.

722
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:26,478
- It would've been nice if he'd come.
- He would like to come...

723
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:30,951
but with his trial coming up,
it's hard to leave the country.

724
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:34,316
- So he sent you instead?
- Something like that.

725
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:36,550
We'll talk at my house, shall we?

726
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:40,436
You got good stuff here.
Class-A shit.

727
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:04,995
This Lopez guarantees
to buy 150 kilos from me...

728
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:06,308
every month of the year.

729
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:07,549
He picks it up here.

730
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:09,790
I can sell it to him
for as little as...

731
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:14,950
$7,000 a key.
You can't do better than that.

732
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:18,479
But then we got to take the risk
of moving it.

733
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:21,513
We'll be cutting out the Colombians.
Know what that means?

734
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:23,431
That means we have
to go to war with them.

735
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:26,557
We cut out the Colombians,
we take risks on both sides.

736
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:28,837
Why don't we split the risk?

737
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:33,830
You guarantee your delivery,
say, as far as Panama...

738
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:36,312
we take it from there.

739
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:41,836
Panama is risky. It costs me more.

740
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:47,513
Panama I can sell for $13,500 a key.

741
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:51,154
$13,500? What, are you nuts?

742
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:56,150
$13,500? We still
got to take that shit to Florida.

743
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:58,276
<i>Do you know
what that's like these days?</i>

744
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:00,351
You got the Navy everywhere.

745
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:04,672
You got frogmen. You got EC-2s
with the satellite-tracking shit.

746
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:08,397
You got the fucking Bell 209
assault choppers up the ass.

747
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:11,269
We're losing one
out of every nine loads.

748
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:14,998
That's no duckwalk anymore,
let me tell you.

749
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:16,599
Forget about $13,500.

750
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,639
What do you suggest
that is reasonable?

751
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,956
Excuse me. One moment.

752
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:36,470
What the fuck's the matter with you?

753
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:38,152
Are you negotiating for Frank Lopez?

754
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:40,390
Don't worry about it. Take it easy.

755
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:43,392
I'm not worried about it.
You should worry about it.

756
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:46,679
If he wants to make a deal,
it's up to him, not you.

757
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:48,273
We're doing this one deal.
That's it.

758
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:50,191
Fuck you. How's that?

759
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:52,958
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you.

760
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:55,719
You need to open your eyes
and keep your mouth shut.

761
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:58,598
That's it. Let it go at that.
Don't worry about it.

762
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:01,831
Your head's in the wrong place.
You must watch out for yourself.

763
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:03,069
<i>Why not talk to him?</i>

764
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:05,037
<i>You think he wants
to give you the money?</i>

765
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:06,519
Shut the fuck up.

766
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:08,591
I'm doing the talking here, not you.

767
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:11,914
You're here to watch my back.
Watch my back.

768
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:15,231
Better than your front,
let me tell you.

769
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:16,719
<i>That's easier to watch.</i>

770
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:18,153
Close your mouth.

771
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:21,637
I can't wait to see what Frank's
gonna react to this one.

772
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:24,668
Just shut up.
I'm doing the talking here.

773
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:28,235
Now where were we?
Panama.

774
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:30,830
You're looking for a partner, right?

775
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:33,639
Something like that.

776
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:37,076
Look, Mr. Sosa,
we're getting ahead of ourselves.

777
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:41,759
I am down on Frank's authority
to buy 200 keys, that's it.

778
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,195
That's my limit. I got no right.

779
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:47,238
- Nobody got no right to negotiate...
- Let the man finish, okay?

780
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:49,914
Let him propose a proposition,
then we can talk more.

781
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,911
You got no authority here.

782
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,673
I started you in this business,
so shut the fuck up.

783
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:58,594
- Frank is gonna love it.
- That's up to Frank, not you!

784
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:03,996
I'm sorry about this, Mr. Sosa.

785
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:05,919
No, it is all right.

786
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:09,557
You're right.
Maybe you should talk to Frank.

787
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:13,389
Well, good.

788
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:17,672
I don't think it's something
I want to do on an overseas phone.

789
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:22,670
But as soon as I get back to Miami,
I will talk to Frank personally.

790
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:24,749
Good.

791
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:27,789
My associates can escort you
to my chopper...

792
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:29,518
<i>to take you to Santa Cruz.</i>

793
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:32,558
<i>I have a jet there.
You'll be in Miami in five hours.</i>

794
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:35,518
You'll be back here tomorrow
in time for lunch.

795
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:38,075
Good.

796
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:43,318
Good talking to you.

797
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:46,356
Why not leave your friend here?

798
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:49,113
While you're gone, he can tell me
how to run my business.

799
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:52,158
- I think Frank wants to see him.
- No, that's okay.

800
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:55,755
You tell Frank I'm keeping this guy
on ice for him.

801
01:01:58,400 --> 01:01:59,879
I guess so.

802
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,752
Let's finish our lunch.

803
01:02:09,080 --> 01:02:11,196
I have to hand it to you, Mr. Sosa.

804
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:14,670
You got everything a man could want.

805
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:19,233
I like you, Tony.
There is no lying in you.

806
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:24,753
Unfortunately, I don't feel the same
about the rest of your organization.

807
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:30,310
What do you mean by that, Mr. Sosa?

808
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:33,269
I'm talking about Omar Suarez.

809
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:39,236
This garbage was recognized
by my associate at lunch...

810
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:42,435
<i>from several years ago in New York.</i>

811
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:48,596
He was an informer for the police.

812
01:03:05,720 --> 01:03:09,793
He put Vito Duval and Nello
and Gino Ramos away for life.

813
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:16,959
<i>So how do I know
you're not a chivato, too, Tony?</i>

814
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:25,870
Let's get this straight now.

815
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:31,513
I've never fucked anybody over
who didn't have it coming.

816
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:33,079
You got that?

817
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:37,629
All I have in this world
is my balls and my word.

818
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:40,991
I don't break them for no one,
you understand?

819
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:44,594
That piece of shit up there,
I never liked him...

820
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:46,113
I never trusted him.

821
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:48,231
For all I know, he had me set up...

822
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:50,595
and had my friend
Angel Fernandez killed.

823
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:52,989
But that's history.
I'm here, he's not.

824
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:55,355
You want to go on with me, say it.

825
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:58,079
You don't, then you make a move.

826
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:06,080
I think you speak from the heart,
Montana.

827
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:07,513
<i>But I say to myself...</i>

828
01:04:08,560 --> 01:04:10,471
this Lopez, your boss...

829
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:14,233
<i>he had chivatos like that
working for him.</i>

830
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:16,678
His judgment stinks.

831
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:20,991
So I think to myself...

832
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:24,278
how many other mistakes
has this Lopez guy made?

833
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:30,388
How can I trust his organization?
You tell me, Tony.

834
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:35,393
Frank is smart, you know?

835
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:39,910
You can't blame him for that animal.

836
01:04:41,080 --> 01:04:43,753
It's a crazy business we're in,
you know?

837
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:46,479
That could happen to anyone,
even you.

838
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:55,433
Why don't I go back
and talk to Frank...

839
01:04:56,360 --> 01:04:57,793
and work it out?

840
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:00,517
I'll fix things between us.

841
01:05:02,360 --> 01:05:03,918
You got my word on that.

842
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:08,233
I think you and me,
we can work this thing out...

843
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:11,149
we do business together
for a long time.

844
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:14,354
Just remember...

845
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:17,390
I'll only tell you one time...

846
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:20,431
don't fuck me, Tony.

847
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:24,871
Don't you ever try to fuck me.

848
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:39,388
You what?

849
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:44,876
You made a deal
for fucking $18 million...

850
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:46,234
without even checking with me?

851
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:48,311
Are you crazy, Montana?
Are you crazy?

852
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:50,118
<i>- Coño. Take it easy.
- Coño, my ass!</i>

853
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:53,192
<i>At $10,500 a key. It's puro.</i>

854
01:05:54,680 --> 01:05:56,910
You can't lose money. No way.

855
01:05:58,840 --> 01:06:02,196
We make $75 million on this deal.

856
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:05,110
$75 million.

857
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:08,032
That is serious money.

858
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:10,072
What is Sosa going to do...

859
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:12,355
when I don't come up
with the first $5 million?

860
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:15,113
What is he going to do?
Will he send me a bill?

861
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:18,510
He'll send a hit squad up here!
There'll be a war in the street.

862
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:22,195
Relax! Take it easy.
I'm in tight with Sosa.

863
01:06:23,960 --> 01:06:26,952
You short a couple of million,
I go on the street for you.

864
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:28,917
I make a couple of moves...

865
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:31,875
a million here, a million there,
you got it.

866
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:39,630
You've been making moves
on your own?

867
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:44,638
I got ears, you know? I hear things.

868
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:51,118
What do you hear about Echevierra
and the Diaz brothers?

869
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:53,316
<i>What about Gomez?</i>

870
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:55,630
<i>What'll he do
when you start moving 2,000 keys...</i>

871
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:59,474
Fuck Gaspar Gomez
and fuck the Diaz brothers!

872
01:06:59,560 --> 01:07:00,709
<i>Fuck 'em all!</i>

873
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:03,710
I'll bury those cockroaches!

874
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:06,918
What they ever do for us?

875
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:17,278
Look, Frank, the time has come.

876
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:20,312
We gotta expand.

877
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:23,833
The whole operation. Distribution.

878
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:27,992
New York, Chicago, LA.

879
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:32,353
We gotta set our own mark
and enforce it.

880
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:34,792
We gotta think big now.

881
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:40,474
Think big.

882
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:47,878
<i>Like your friend Sosa.</i>

883
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:53,391
Let me tell you something
about that greaseball cocksucker.

884
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:56,388
He is a snake, that's what he is.

885
01:07:58,160 --> 01:08:01,948
<i>You turn your back on him,
he'll stick it in.</i>

886
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:04,751
<i>You don't trust a guy like that.</i>

887
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:08,350
You want me to believe...

888
01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:12,953
Omar was a stoolie
because Sosa said so?

889
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:14,919
You bought that line?

890
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:18,879
<i>Maybe I made a mistake
sending you down there.</i>

891
01:08:20,280 --> 01:08:23,158
Maybe you and Sosa
know something I don't know.

892
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:27,475
Like what?

893
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:29,993
Like what?

894
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:33,596
You tell me, "Like what."

895
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:40,074
You calling me a liar, Frank?

896
01:08:41,080 --> 01:08:42,752
That what you're calling me?

897
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:52,115
Let's just say I want things
to stay the way they are for now.

898
01:08:55,320 --> 01:08:57,788
You stall your deal with Sosa.

899
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:00,668
Stall it?

900
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:06,359
Okay, boss.

901
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:07,989
Come on.

902
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:11,549
I am the boss.

903
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:15,189
Sure, you're the boss.
Hey, Tony.

904
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:21,868
Remember I told you
when you started...

905
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:24,429
the guys who last
in this business...

906
01:09:25,280 --> 01:09:27,396
are the guys who fly straight...

907
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:30,073
<i>low-key, quiet.</i>

908
01:09:31,320 --> 01:09:33,276
<i>And the guys who want it all...</i>

909
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:37,111
<i>chicas, champagne, flash...</i>

910
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,399
they don't last.

911
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:43,068
You finished?

912
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:45,109
Can I go now?

913
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:08,158
Hi, there.

914
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:16,758
You just missed Frank.

915
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:20,869
Too bad.

916
01:10:23,160 --> 01:10:25,151
Only I didn't come to see Frank.

917
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:29,438
This is not the time
or the place, Tony.

918
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:32,388
Make an appointment.
That's okay.

919
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:35,472
I got something important
I want to talk to you about.

920
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:44,548
<i>So why don't we have
a couple of drinks...</i>

921
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:46,353
<i>act normal...</i>

922
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:50,272
<i>and just take it easy.</i>

923
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:52,911
<i>Come on. I like Scotch.</i>

924
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:00,751
- Sure. Why not?
- Okay. I won't bite you.

925
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:05,191
We're all normal here.

926
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:12,349
I heard you and Frank
aren't working together anymore.

927
01:11:12,720 --> 01:11:13,994
That's right.

928
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:20,550
I think it's easier, don't you?

929
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:22,918
Makes things easier.

930
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:26,429
Thank you.

931
01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:29,756
Here's to "the land of opportunity."

932
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:32,159
For you, maybe.

933
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:38,189
You like kids?

934
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:40,989
Kids?

935
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:43,750
Kids. You know, kids. Little kids.

936
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:47,476
Sure. Why not?

937
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:49,273
As long as there's a nurse.

938
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:52,193
Good, 'cause I like kids, too.

939
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:58,039
I like them. Boys, girls.
Don't matter to me.

940
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:03,236
Frank's gonna be back any minute.

941
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:05,159
Come here.

942
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:12,909
Sit here.

943
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:16,911
<i>I want to talk to you. Sit down.
I'm not gonna bite you.</i>

944
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:24,358
Okay, here's the story.

945
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:30,557
I come from the gutter. I know that.

946
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:34,432
I got no education...

947
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:36,759
but that's okay.

948
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:40,076
I know the street...

949
01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:42,549
and I'm making
all the right connections.

950
01:12:43,640 --> 01:12:47,030
With the right woman,
there's no stopping me.

951
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:49,791
I could go right to the top.

952
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:52,875
Anyway...

953
01:12:53,720 --> 01:12:55,790
what I got to tell you is this:

954
01:12:57,880 --> 01:12:59,359
I like you.

955
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:05,193
I liked you
the first time I laid eyes on you.

956
01:13:08,280 --> 01:13:10,748
I said, "She's a tiger.

957
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:14,957
"She'll belong to me."

958
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:20,153
Anyway...

959
01:13:21,400 --> 01:13:23,118
I want you to marry me.

960
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:28,878
I want you to be
the mother of my children.

961
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:34,512
Me? Marry you?

962
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:35,794
That's right.

963
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:41,992
What about Frank, Tony?

964
01:13:42,680 --> 01:13:44,193
<i>What will you do about Frank?</i>

965
01:13:44,280 --> 01:13:47,670
Frank is not gonna last, okay?
He's finished.

966
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:52,388
Just think about it, okay?

967
01:13:53,640 --> 01:13:55,915
I want you to really think about it.

968
01:13:58,440 --> 01:14:01,318
I'll go now. Take care.

969
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:11,232
All your enemies are gone.

970
01:14:12,680 --> 01:14:15,148
- Mr. Montana. How are you?
- Hello.

971
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:24,477
What the fuck she doing here?

972
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:28,752
Come on, man. She's just
dancing. Come on. Take it easy.

973
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:44,830
- It's just a disco.
- Who's that guy she's with?

974
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,275
He's some guy who works
for Luco. He's nobody.

975
01:14:48,360 --> 01:14:49,998
- He's harmless.
- Works for Luco?

976
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:52,435
Yeah. Forget him.

977
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:58,034
Hello, Tony. You remember me?

978
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:04,069
Bernstein. Mel Bernstein, right?

979
01:15:04,920 --> 01:15:06,956
Chief Detective, Narcotics.

980
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:10,394
That's right, yeah.
I think we should talk.

981
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:13,554
Talk?
What are we going to talk about?

982
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:16,958
I ain't killed nobody, not lately.

983
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:19,078
No, not lately.

984
01:15:19,160 --> 01:15:22,755
What about ancient history,
like Emilio Rebenga?

985
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:25,877
Or a bunch of whacked-out Indians
at the Sun Ray Motel?

986
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:29,436
Whoever's giving you
your information...

987
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:31,158
is taking you for a long ride.

988
01:15:32,680 --> 01:15:34,955
Tony, baby, we gonna talk...

989
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:37,838
or am I gonna bust
your wiseass spic balls...

990
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:39,239
here and now?

991
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:46,393
Keep your eye on her.

992
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:48,879
I'll do that.
Okay.

993
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:52,471
- My office.
- Good.

994
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:03,390
<i>The word on the street is
you're bringing in a lot of yeyo.</i>

995
01:16:03,640 --> 01:16:06,029
That means you're not
a small-time punk anymore...

996
01:16:06,120 --> 01:16:07,917
you're public property now.

997
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,719
Supreme Court says
that your privacy can be invaded.

998
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:12,472
Okay. How much?

999
01:16:13,960 --> 01:16:15,279
How much?

1000
01:16:15,960 --> 01:16:18,315
There's an answer to that, too.

1001
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:25,959
<i>Here's how much.</i>

1002
01:16:27,160 --> 01:16:28,388
Can you see it?

1003
01:16:30,360 --> 01:16:32,157
- Big number.
- Yeah!

1004
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:35,118
That's on a monthly basis,
same thing every month.

1005
01:16:35,560 --> 01:16:37,198
You know how this works?

1006
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:40,393
No. You tell me.

1007
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:43,269
We tell you
who's moving against you...

1008
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:46,313
and we shake down
who you want shaken down.

1009
01:16:47,160 --> 01:16:50,357
Let's say that you got
a real problem making a collection.

1010
01:16:51,680 --> 01:16:53,511
And then we step in for you.

1011
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:56,150
Got eight killers with badges
working for me.

1012
01:16:56,240 --> 01:16:59,198
When they hit, it hurts.
Same thing works the other way.

1013
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:01,271
You feed me a bust now and then.

1014
01:17:01,640 --> 01:17:04,757
<i>Some cowboy setting himself up
in business.</i>

1015
01:17:05,400 --> 01:17:07,550
Small fry, you know?

1016
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:12,758
We like snacks.

1017
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:16,231
How do I know you're the last cop
I'm gonna have to grease?

1018
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:21,436
What about Fort Lauderdale?
Metro? DEA?

1019
01:17:22,240 --> 01:17:25,038
How do I know what rock
they're gonna crawl out from under?

1020
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:29,159
Well, that's not my business, Tony.
We don't cross no lines.

1021
01:17:30,440 --> 01:17:34,877
You think I want this conversation
going any farther than this table?

1022
01:17:35,320 --> 01:17:38,437
My guys got families.
They're legitimate cops.

1023
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:40,631
I don't want
to see them embarrassed.

1024
01:17:40,720 --> 01:17:42,517
If they're embarrassed,
they'll suffer.

1025
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:45,194
If they suffer,
they'll make you suffer.

1026
01:17:47,680 --> 01:17:49,955
<i>You understand
what I'm talking about?</i>

1027
01:18:00,200 --> 01:18:01,792
Thanks for the drink.

1028
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:05,959
By the way...

1029
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:08,871
I got a vacation coming up.

1030
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:11,469
I'm gonna take the wife
to London, England.

1031
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:12,959
We've never been there.

1032
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:16,191
So throw in a couple
of round-trip tickets, first class.

1033
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:25,917
You gotta smile more, Tony.
You gotta enjoy yourself.

1034
01:18:26,520 --> 01:18:28,829
Every day above ground
is a good day.

1035
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:42,956
- Hello.
- Hello.

1036
01:18:44,360 --> 01:18:46,351
Yeah. Now that's the idea.

1037
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:48,152
Okay, Mel.

1038
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:52,231
You think about what I said?

1039
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:53,994
About the kids?

1040
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:59,672
- You know, you are really nuts.
- I'm nuts about you.

1041
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:02,755
Why don't you find your own girl?

1042
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:04,115
My own girl?
Yeah.

1043
01:19:04,200 --> 01:19:07,112
That's what I'm doing.
Do it somewhere else.

1044
01:19:07,200 --> 01:19:09,350
Maybe I don't hear
so good sometimes.

1045
01:19:09,480 --> 01:19:11,675
You won't hear anything
if you go on like this.

1046
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:12,909
Will you do something?

1047
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,639
You're fucking right
I'm going to do something!

1048
01:19:16,840 --> 01:19:18,717
I'm giving you orders. Blow!

1049
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:22,355
Orders? You giving me orders?

1050
01:19:27,720 --> 01:19:29,950
The only thing in this world...

1051
01:19:30,040 --> 01:19:33,510
that gives orders is balls.
You got that?

1052
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:36,149
<i>Balls.</i>

1053
01:19:46,160 --> 01:19:47,309
Let's go.

1054
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:55,869
Elvira.

1055
01:19:57,240 --> 01:19:58,912
When you gonna learn?

1056
01:20:01,560 --> 01:20:05,109
Looking good, honey.
Keep up the bad work.

1057
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:08,791
That cocksucker.
What happened?

1058
01:20:09,680 --> 01:20:13,355
- He put that prick Bernstein on me.
- Who? Lopez did?

1059
01:20:14,840 --> 01:20:15,955
How do you know?

1060
01:20:16,040 --> 01:20:18,315
Who else knew about Rebenga?
Omar?

1061
01:20:18,920 --> 01:20:20,512
<i>He's fertilizer.</i>

1062
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,434
He's letting me know
he's got weight on me.

1063
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:28,072
I'll tell you what, man.

1064
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:30,993
<i>You know our little trip
we've been planning to New York?</i>

1065
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:32,752
<i>It might be a good time.</i>

1066
01:20:49,160 --> 01:20:51,037
Wait. Where you going?

1067
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:17,432
Welcome to my private room.

1068
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:20,114
- Your private room.
- This is my private room.

1069
01:21:20,200 --> 01:21:23,715
<i>I got a beautiful, nice,
white lounge chair for you.</i>

1070
01:21:28,640 --> 01:21:30,915
<i>Gina, you taste so muy bueno.</i>

1071
01:21:36,120 --> 01:21:37,951
What are you doing?
Shut up!

1072
01:21:38,040 --> 01:21:41,555
We wasn't doing nothing!
Fernando, wait!

1073
01:21:41,880 --> 01:21:43,199
Get out!

1074
01:21:45,880 --> 01:21:47,199
Damn you!

1075
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:48,952
You think he's cute?

1076
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:51,395
I saw him putting his hand
all over your ass.

1077
01:21:51,480 --> 01:21:53,277
My kid sister in a toilet.

1078
01:21:53,360 --> 01:21:54,554
It's none of your business.

1079
01:21:54,640 --> 01:21:56,949
None of my business?
The fuck it ain't!

1080
01:21:57,040 --> 01:21:59,270
Don't tell me what to do!
I'll tell you!

1081
01:21:59,360 --> 01:22:01,271
Listen to me. Come here.

1082
01:22:02,280 --> 01:22:07,308
I catch you here again, I'm gonna
wipe you all over the fucking place.

1083
01:22:07,640 --> 01:22:10,473
Yeah? Go ahead!
Do it now. I want to see it.

1084
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:12,755
- I want to see it now, big shot.
- Don't push me.

1085
01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:16,230
- I want to see it now!
- Don't push me! Get outta here!

1086
01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:19,916
- Go outside.
- You got some nerve, Tony!

1087
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:22,914
You think you can
tell me what to do?

1088
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,878
You can't tell me what to do.
I'm not a baby anymore.

1089
01:22:25,960 --> 01:22:28,713
I'll do what I want to do,
see whoever I want to see.

1090
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:31,758
And if I want to fuck them,
then I'll fuck them!

1091
01:22:33,320 --> 01:22:35,880
Fucking, man! Come on, man.

1092
01:22:39,880 --> 01:22:42,348
What the fuck you want?
You want something?

1093
01:22:43,280 --> 01:22:45,430
No. Don't touch me.

1094
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:49,112
- No.
- We've got to get out of here.

1095
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:52,909
Not there.
I don't want to go out there.

1096
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:55,835
<i>Another great night here
at the Babylon?</i>

1097
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:57,797
<i>Okay. All right!</i>

1098
01:22:58,040 --> 01:23:00,554
<i>Do another gram,
you'll all be babbling on.</i>

1099
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:04,193
<i>Is that coke in your bra,
or are you just glad to see me?</i>

1100
01:23:04,280 --> 01:23:06,236
<i>A little bit of hope, I'm sure, yes.</i>

1101
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:09,312
<i>I'm in a good mood. I was depressed
when I got up this morning.</i>

1102
01:23:09,400 --> 01:23:12,198
<i>I had a dry dream,
but I'm better now.</i>

1103
01:23:26,840 --> 01:23:29,070
<i>I do Laurel and Hardy
in Spanish, too.</i>

1104
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:33,636
<i>That's the height of culture,
I assure you.</i>

1105
01:23:33,720 --> 01:23:37,030
<i>But my favorite Cuban of all time
has to be Ricky Ricardo.</i>

1106
01:23:37,320 --> 01:23:39,276
<i>Mr. Babalu himself.</i>

1107
01:23:39,360 --> 01:23:41,112
<i>He had the same problem
for 10 years.</i>

1108
01:23:41,200 --> 01:23:43,760
<i>"Lucy, don't come down to the club."</i>

1109
01:24:14,360 --> 01:24:17,352
He's your brother. He loves you.
That's why he did it.

1110
01:24:17,440 --> 01:24:19,431
All right? He cares about you.

1111
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:21,988
To him,
you're still his little sister.

1112
01:24:22,120 --> 01:24:25,396
That's the problem.
He still treats me like I'm a baby.

1113
01:24:25,480 --> 01:24:26,959
I'm 20 years old now.

1114
01:24:27,040 --> 01:24:29,793
- I'm not anybody's baby.
- You're so grown-up.

1115
01:24:32,520 --> 01:24:35,751
Come on, Gina.
Put yourself in his place, okay?

1116
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:39,310
Right now, you happen
to be the best thing in his life.

1117
01:24:39,400 --> 01:24:43,154
The only thing that's any good,
that's pure.

1118
01:24:44,040 --> 01:24:46,838
Of course he doesn't want you
mixing with those people...

1119
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:48,239
growing up to be like him.

1120
01:24:49,480 --> 01:24:52,677
He has this father thing for you.
Feels like he has to protect you.

1121
01:24:52,760 --> 01:24:54,432
Protect me against what?

1122
01:24:54,720 --> 01:24:58,190
Against guys like that asshole
you were dancing with tonight.

1123
01:24:58,280 --> 01:25:02,193
I like Fernando.
He's a fun guy and he's nice.

1124
01:25:03,720 --> 01:25:06,518
And he knows how to treat a woman.
All right?

1125
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:08,552
- He knows how to treat a woman?
- Yes.

1126
01:25:08,640 --> 01:25:10,631
By taking her to the toilet
to make out?

1127
01:25:10,720 --> 01:25:14,599
<i>You've been a great audience.
I got a special treat for you.</i>

1128
01:25:14,680 --> 01:25:16,193
<i>Here's a guy I found in the jungle.</i>

1129
01:25:16,280 --> 01:25:19,033
<i>From Caracas, Venezuela.
He's unlike anything you've seen.</i>

1130
01:25:19,120 --> 01:25:22,590
<i>Give a warm Babylon welcome
to the one and only Octavio!</i>

1131
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:50,270
Look around. Go out with someone
who has something on the ball...

1132
01:25:50,360 --> 01:25:52,954
- who's going somewhere in life.
- Like who?

1133
01:25:53,640 --> 01:25:56,871
For instance, someone who's got
a real job, like a banker.

1134
01:25:56,960 --> 01:25:59,713
Or, or a doctor, a lawyer...
What about you?

1135
01:26:02,040 --> 01:26:05,077
- What are you talking about?
- Why don't you take me out?

1136
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:06,991
Are you crazy?

1137
01:26:07,080 --> 01:26:08,991
I see the way you look at me,
Manolo.

1138
01:26:09,280 --> 01:26:11,999
Do you think I'm blind? I see.
Come on.

1139
01:26:12,440 --> 01:26:14,317
What?
Look, Gina...

1140
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:18,274
Tony and I are like brothers,
all right?

1141
01:26:18,640 --> 01:26:20,198
You're his kid sister.

1142
01:26:20,280 --> 01:26:21,872
- So what?
- That's where it ends.

1143
01:26:22,640 --> 01:26:25,632
- That's where it stays.
- Are you afraid of Tony?

1144
01:26:26,520 --> 01:26:29,876
- You afraid of Tony's kid sister?
- I'm not afraid of anybody!

1145
01:26:30,200 --> 01:26:32,031
<i>That's not the point here!</i>

1146
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:46,757
It's not for me. Don't look at me.

1147
01:28:46,840 --> 01:28:49,798
How do you know?
'Cause I'm not here.

1148
01:28:49,880 --> 01:28:51,677
Really? Then where are you?

1149
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:56,039
Shit, you're weird.

1150
01:28:56,120 --> 01:28:58,350
- I'm weird?
- Hello?

1151
01:28:58,440 --> 01:29:00,749
<i>Hello, Miriam?
Tony!</i>

1152
01:29:00,840 --> 01:29:03,957
<i>Put Manny on, okay?
Okay. Just a second.</i>

1153
01:29:04,280 --> 01:29:05,508
It's Tony.

1154
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:10,550
<i>What are you doing,
checking up on me?</i>

1155
01:29:10,640 --> 01:29:12,392
Get your clothes on and meet me...

1156
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:14,596
in front of Lopez Motors
in 45 minutes.

1157
01:29:15,080 --> 01:29:18,152
<i>What? What happened?
Nothing we can't face.</i>

1158
01:29:18,760 --> 01:29:21,035
All right. I'll be there.

1159
01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:23,634
<i>You're still on the phone. Let's go.</i>

1160
01:29:23,720 --> 01:29:24,789
Take it easy, okay?

1161
01:29:24,880 --> 01:29:27,633
I'm leaving now. Fuck.

1162
01:29:28,200 --> 01:29:29,758
Nick?
Yeah, Tony.

1163
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:32,070
This is what
I want you to do for me:

1164
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:35,158
<i>You call Lopez.</i>

1165
01:29:35,640 --> 01:29:39,189
<i>Call him at his office
at 3:00 sharp.</i>

1166
01:29:40,040 --> 01:29:42,838
<i>And you tell him:</i>

1167
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:45,990
<i>"We fucked up, he got away."</i>

1168
01:29:46,640 --> 01:29:49,074
Okay. Yeah.
Got it? What're you going to say?

1169
01:29:49,160 --> 01:29:50,991
"We fucked up. He got away."

1170
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:54,357
What time?
3:00 sharp.

1171
01:29:56,560 --> 01:29:59,199
So when are we gonna make
some money on this thing?

1172
01:29:59,280 --> 01:30:02,113
<i>Six months to start
don't mean shit, Larry.</i>

1173
01:30:02,680 --> 01:30:05,831
<i>I'm not a Rockefeller, you know.
Not yet, anyway.</i>

1174
01:30:07,400 --> 01:30:09,038
<i>So you owe me.</i>

1175
01:30:10,200 --> 01:30:12,634
<i>Listen, go down
to the ball game tonight.</i>

1176
01:30:13,040 --> 01:30:16,191
<i>I couldn't make it. I got things.
I'll tell you about them.</i>

1177
01:30:17,120 --> 01:30:20,271
You're kidding? What was the score?
Three to two?

1178
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:22,794
Mel, guess what?

1179
01:30:22,880 --> 01:30:24,632
My Little League team,
the Little Lopezers...

1180
01:30:24,720 --> 01:30:26,392
they won the division tonight.

1181
01:30:26,480 --> 01:30:28,710
That's great. Congratulations.

1182
01:30:29,080 --> 01:30:31,833
What'd you do, fix the umpire?

1183
01:30:34,600 --> 01:30:37,068
Jesus Christ.

1184
01:30:38,920 --> 01:30:40,751
<i>Tony, what happened to you?</i>

1185
01:30:43,480 --> 01:30:46,313
They wanted to spoil my $800 suit.

1186
01:30:47,360 --> 01:30:49,351
Who the fuck did this?

1187
01:30:49,960 --> 01:30:52,520
Hitters. I don't know.

1188
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:55,670
Somebody must've brought them in.

1189
01:30:56,240 --> 01:30:57,992
I've never seen them before.

1190
01:30:58,400 --> 01:30:59,719
Hello, Mel.

1191
01:31:01,040 --> 01:31:02,758
Got an answer to this, too?

1192
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:07,036
There always is, Tony.
I'll bet it was the Diaz brothers.

1193
01:31:07,120 --> 01:31:09,793
They got a beef going back
to the Sun Ray thing.

1194
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:13,315
Maybe you're right, you know?

1195
01:31:15,240 --> 01:31:19,597
Anyway, I'm glad you made it, Tony.

1196
01:31:20,640 --> 01:31:23,598
We'll return the favor for you,
in spades.

1197
01:31:23,680 --> 01:31:26,319
I'll take care of this myself.

1198
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:33,751
What is the gun for, Tony?

1199
01:31:34,640 --> 01:31:37,279
What, this? It's nothing.

1200
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:42,953
I'm... How do you say? Paranoid.

1201
01:31:56,800 --> 01:31:58,518
You gonna answer, Frank?

1202
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:04,155
It must be Elvira.
She got mad after we left the club.

1203
01:32:07,200 --> 01:32:08,997
I'll tell her you're not here, okay?

1204
01:32:09,080 --> 01:32:12,755
No, it's all right.
I'll talk to her.

1205
01:32:20,400 --> 01:32:21,549
Hello.

1206
01:32:28,080 --> 01:32:31,390
It's all right. I'm gonna be home
in an hour. Don't worry.

1207
01:32:34,280 --> 01:32:37,352
Frank, you're a piece of shit.

1208
01:32:37,480 --> 01:32:40,950
- What are you talking about?
- You know what I'm talking about...

1209
01:32:41,040 --> 01:32:43,429
you fucking cockroach.

1210
01:32:43,560 --> 01:32:46,358
What are you talking about?
Listen to me.

1211
01:32:46,480 --> 01:32:48,596
<i>You know what a chazer is, Frank?</i>

1212
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:52,478
<i>That's a pig
that don't fly straight.</i>

1213
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:55,078
Neither do you, Frank.

1214
01:32:56,560 --> 01:32:59,279
Tony, why the fuck would I hurt you?

1215
01:32:59,640 --> 01:33:01,278
I brought you in.

1216
01:33:01,360 --> 01:33:03,794
So we had a few differences,
no big deal.

1217
01:33:05,080 --> 01:33:07,913
I gave you your start.
I was the one who believed in you.

1218
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,036
I stayed loyal to you.

1219
01:33:12,240 --> 01:33:15,596
I made what I could on the side,
but I never turned on you, Frank!

1220
01:33:16,240 --> 01:33:17,229
Never!

1221
01:33:20,840 --> 01:33:21,989
But you...

1222
01:33:25,400 --> 01:33:29,757
a man who ain't got his word
is a cockroach.

1223
01:33:33,200 --> 01:33:35,794
Mel. Do something, will you?

1224
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,560
It's your tree, Frank.
You're sitting in it.

1225
01:33:50,040 --> 01:33:53,112
All right, Tony. I was the one.

1226
01:33:59,600 --> 01:34:01,909
Please, give me a second chance.

1227
01:34:03,640 --> 01:34:06,393
Will you do that? Please?

1228
01:34:11,040 --> 01:34:14,510
Give me a second chance.
I'll give you $10 million.

1229
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:18,276
<i>Okay? $10 million.</i>

1230
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:21,952
I got it in a vault
over there in Spain, Tony.

1231
01:34:22,040 --> 01:34:26,431
We go over there,
we get on a plane, and it's yours.

1232
01:34:27,080 --> 01:34:30,277
Okay? All of it. $10 million.

1233
01:34:31,120 --> 01:34:32,235
<i>Okay, Tony?</i>

1234
01:34:36,200 --> 01:34:37,474
Please, Tony?

1235
01:34:39,200 --> 01:34:42,272
Elvira? You want Elvira?

1236
01:34:43,040 --> 01:34:45,952
<i>You can have her. I'll go away.
I'm gonna disappear.</i>

1237
01:34:46,040 --> 01:34:49,476
You'll never see me again.
Please, Tony, I don't want to die.

1238
01:34:49,560 --> 01:34:51,437
I never did nothing to nobody.

1239
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:54,398
No, you never did nothing to nobody.

1240
01:34:54,640 --> 01:34:56,517
You had somebody else do it for you.

1241
01:34:56,600 --> 01:34:57,874
Tony, I'm begging you.

1242
01:34:57,960 --> 01:35:01,589
- Get up! Get up now!
- Jesus! No! God!

1243
01:35:06,400 --> 01:35:09,915
Look. Tony, no!
Don't kill me, please.

1244
01:35:12,720 --> 01:35:14,119
I won't kill you.

1245
01:35:14,760 --> 01:35:16,671
- Christ, thank you.
- Get off my foot.

1246
01:35:16,760 --> 01:35:20,275
Thank you.
Manolo, shoot that piece of shit!

1247
01:35:20,560 --> 01:35:22,039
No! No!

1248
01:35:41,360 --> 01:35:44,158
Every dog has his day, Mel?

1249
01:35:44,240 --> 01:35:45,434
I told him...

1250
01:35:46,880 --> 01:35:48,677
it didn't make any sense...

1251
01:35:48,760 --> 01:35:52,435
clipping you when we had you
working for us. He wouldn't listen.

1252
01:35:53,200 --> 01:35:56,875
<i>He got hot tonight about the broad.</i>

1253
01:35:58,920 --> 01:36:00,319
He fucked up.

1254
01:36:01,040 --> 01:36:04,635
You, too, Mel. You fucked up.

1255
01:36:05,800 --> 01:36:07,392
Don't go too far, Tony.

1256
01:36:08,920 --> 01:36:11,593
I'm not, Mel. You are.

1257
01:36:20,080 --> 01:36:22,878
Fuck. You can't shoot a cop!

1258
01:36:24,360 --> 01:36:25,839
Whoever says you was one?

1259
01:36:25,920 --> 01:36:27,399
Wait a minute!

1260
01:36:29,400 --> 01:36:31,470
You let me go. I'll fix this up.

1261
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:35,913
Sure, Mel.
Maybe you can hand yourself...

1262
01:36:36,280 --> 01:36:39,511
one of them first-class tickets
to the Resurrection.

1263
01:36:39,960 --> 01:36:43,509
Fucking punk! Son of a bitch!

1264
01:36:45,200 --> 01:36:47,873
- So long, Mel. Have a good trip.
- Fuck you!

1265
01:36:54,400 --> 01:36:57,472
- Okay, come on.
- What about Ernie?

1266
01:37:07,160 --> 01:37:08,752
You want a job, Ernie?

1267
01:37:12,200 --> 01:37:15,237
- Sure, Tony.
- Okay, then you call me tomorrow.

1268
01:37:15,920 --> 01:37:17,672
Man, you got a job!

1269
01:37:18,560 --> 01:37:20,915
Tony! Thanks.

1270
01:37:55,080 --> 01:37:56,832
God, what's happened?

1271
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:00,353
Where's Frank?

1272
01:38:02,080 --> 01:38:03,718
Where do you think?

1273
01:38:08,760 --> 01:38:12,150
<i>Come on. Get your stuff.</i>

1274
01:38:12,640 --> 01:38:14,119
<i>You're coming with me.</i>

1275
01:42:39,840 --> 01:42:43,150
So you come to me
with some kind of thing. Okay.

1276
01:42:43,240 --> 01:42:45,151
<i>You propose it, I talk to you.</i>

1277
01:42:45,600 --> 01:42:48,751
<i>But we got a problem.
I can't pay more.</i>

1278
01:42:49,840 --> 01:42:52,718
I'm bringing in twice as much
as I ever did before.

1279
01:42:52,920 --> 01:42:56,151
We're doing $10 million,
$15 million a month. Come on.

1280
01:42:56,320 --> 01:42:58,276
That's serious money.

1281
01:42:58,560 --> 01:43:00,278
You bank boys gotta come down a bit.

1282
01:43:00,360 --> 01:43:01,349
No way.

1283
01:43:01,440 --> 01:43:05,069
- That's crazy. We can't do that.
- Then that's too bad.

1284
01:43:05,360 --> 01:43:08,511
- What am I gonna do?
- We're not a wholesale operation.

1285
01:43:08,600 --> 01:43:11,956
We're a legitimate bank.
The more cash you give me...

1286
01:43:12,200 --> 01:43:14,350
the harder it is for me to rinse.

1287
01:43:14,840 --> 01:43:16,637
That's a problem. I didn't know.

1288
01:43:16,720 --> 01:43:19,518
The fact is, I can't take any more
of your money...

1289
01:43:19,600 --> 01:43:21,830
unless I raise the rates on you.

1290
01:43:23,400 --> 01:43:25,152
- You gonna raise the...
- I gotta do it.

1291
01:43:25,240 --> 01:43:26,355
The IRS is coming...

1292
01:43:26,440 --> 01:43:29,000
Don't give me that shit! Let's talk.

1293
01:43:29,080 --> 01:43:30,069
I'm talking.

1294
01:43:30,160 --> 01:43:32,549
I go low, you go high.
I know the game.

1295
01:43:32,640 --> 01:43:35,074
- This is business talk.
- Let me explain something.

1296
01:43:35,160 --> 01:43:37,515
The IRS is coming down heavy
on South Florida.

1297
01:43:37,600 --> 01:43:39,909
<i>There was a Time Magazine story
that didn't help.</i>

1298
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:41,399
There's a recession.

1299
01:43:41,480 --> 01:43:43,710
I got stockholders
I got to be responsible for.

1300
01:43:43,800 --> 01:43:46,109
- I got to do it, Tony.
- You'll learn from him.

1301
01:43:46,200 --> 01:43:49,431
I got to go 10% on the first
$12 million in denominations of 20.

1302
01:43:49,520 --> 01:43:51,431
<i>I'll go 8% on your $10 bills...</i>

1303
01:43:51,520 --> 01:43:52,509
<i>6% on your fives.</i>

1304
01:43:52,600 --> 01:43:54,318
- We'll go somewhere else.
- That's it.

1305
01:43:54,400 --> 01:43:57,790
- There's no place else to go.
- Fuck you, man! Fuck you!

1306
01:43:57,880 --> 01:44:00,599
I'll fly the cash myself
to the Bahamas.

1307
01:44:01,080 --> 01:44:02,957
Once, maybe. Then what?

1308
01:44:04,120 --> 01:44:06,315
You'll trust some monkey
in a Bahamian bank...

1309
01:44:06,400 --> 01:44:08,391
with 20 million
of your hard-earned dollars?

1310
01:44:08,480 --> 01:44:10,232
Come on, Tony. Don't be a schmuck.

1311
01:44:10,600 --> 01:44:11,828
<i>Who else can you trust?</i>

1312
01:44:11,920 --> 01:44:14,593
<i>That's why you pay us so much.
You trust us.</i>

1313
01:44:19,200 --> 01:44:20,872
Did you hear that guy?

1314
01:44:21,240 --> 01:44:23,800
You got to listen to him.
You'll learn something.

1315
01:44:23,880 --> 01:44:25,029
Stay with us.

1316
01:44:25,120 --> 01:44:28,078
You're a well-liked customer.
You're in good hands with us.

1317
01:44:30,400 --> 01:44:32,675
And I got to run.
I'm safe but poor.

1318
01:44:34,040 --> 01:44:37,077
- How's married life treating you?
- Better than you are.

1319
01:44:38,520 --> 01:44:41,557
Say hello to the princess for me.
She's beautiful.

1320
01:44:41,640 --> 01:44:45,189
I'll see you. Take care.
You, too.

1321
01:44:58,040 --> 01:44:59,439
That prick!

1322
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:02,558
Fucking WASP whore.

1323
01:45:03,560 --> 01:45:06,916
<i>Talking to me like I'm some maricón
who came over on a boat.</i>

1324
01:45:08,240 --> 01:45:11,437
I tell you what. We don't need
that smiling motherfucker.

1325
01:45:11,520 --> 01:45:14,876
We should talk to this Jewish guy,
Seidelbaum, okay?

1326
01:45:15,200 --> 01:45:18,988
He's got his own exchange.
He charges 4% at the most.

1327
01:45:19,680 --> 01:45:21,159
And he's connected.

1328
01:45:22,320 --> 01:45:26,154
Fuck them. Mob guys. Guineas.

1329
01:45:27,600 --> 01:45:29,079
I don't trust them.

1330
01:45:47,600 --> 01:45:50,319
Did you sweep the house this month?
The cars?

1331
01:45:50,760 --> 01:45:54,230
Yeah, I told you about it.
The $5,000?

1332
01:45:55,360 --> 01:45:57,794
- Look at that.
- What?

1333
01:45:58,640 --> 01:46:00,198
That cable truck there.

1334
01:46:00,280 --> 01:46:03,078
<i>Since when does it take three days
to rig a cable?</i>

1335
01:46:05,280 --> 01:46:07,748
What? You been watching it
for three days?

1336
01:46:09,640 --> 01:46:11,790
The thing has been there
for three days.

1337
01:46:11,880 --> 01:46:13,598
What am I gonna do, not look at it?

1338
01:46:14,160 --> 01:46:16,913
- What, you think it's cops, right?
- I don't know.

1339
01:46:17,120 --> 01:46:20,271
Could be the Diaz brothers,
coming to get me.

1340
01:46:22,040 --> 01:46:25,953
- Maybe. I'll check it out, okay?
- You check it out.

1341
01:46:26,040 --> 01:46:29,396
Then we're gonna blow
that fucking truck back to Colombia!

1342
01:46:29,680 --> 01:46:33,832
Come on. We're not the only dopers
living on the block.

1343
01:46:33,920 --> 01:46:35,194
Okay? Remember that.

1344
01:46:35,280 --> 01:46:38,158
That truck could be anybody
and anything.

1345
01:46:38,240 --> 01:46:39,559
<i>It could be a cable company...</i>

1346
01:46:39,640 --> 01:46:41,870
You know something?
You got some fucking attitude.

1347
01:46:41,960 --> 01:46:44,520
For someone who's in charge
of my security...

1348
01:46:44,920 --> 01:46:47,832
Here are the keys to the front door.

1349
01:46:47,920 --> 01:46:49,717
Go down there. Give them the keys!

1350
01:46:49,800 --> 01:46:51,438
I'm just trying to say something.

1351
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:54,432
You're spending a lot of money
on this counter-surveillance.

1352
01:46:54,520 --> 01:46:55,589
I don't give a fuck.

1353
01:46:55,680 --> 01:46:58,194
It's 12% of our adjusted gross.

1354
01:46:58,280 --> 01:46:59,429
12% isn't peanuts.

1355
01:46:59,520 --> 01:47:00,635
I don't give a fuck!

1356
01:47:00,720 --> 01:47:03,075
It makes me sleep good at night.
That's what counts.

1357
01:47:03,160 --> 01:47:05,435
- Okay? You worry about it.
- I am worried about it.

1358
01:47:05,520 --> 01:47:08,159
I'm telling you.
We're getting sloppy.

1359
01:47:08,640 --> 01:47:12,076
Our thinking, our fucking attitude,
you know?

1360
01:47:12,280 --> 01:47:13,998
We're not fucking hungry anymore.

1361
01:47:14,320 --> 01:47:16,595
<i>Miami's changing.
You can see it everywhere.</i>

1362
01:47:16,680 --> 01:47:18,511
<i>New construction. New jobs.</i>

1363
01:47:18,720 --> 01:47:21,439
<i>Growth that's financed
by Florida Security Trust.</i>

1364
01:47:21,520 --> 01:47:24,034
<i>We've put your money to work
for 75 years...</i>

1365
01:47:24,120 --> 01:47:26,076
<i>building a more prosperous Miami.</i>

1366
01:47:26,480 --> 01:47:28,436
<i>Count on us being here tomorrow.</i>

1367
01:47:28,520 --> 01:47:31,557
That's because for 75 years
you been fucking everybody.

1368
01:47:31,840 --> 01:47:35,355
Somebody should do something
about those whores.

1369
01:47:35,680 --> 01:47:38,148
I mean, charging me 10 points
on my money.

1370
01:47:38,240 --> 01:47:41,869
They're getting away with it.
Fuck, there's no laws anymore.

1371
01:47:41,960 --> 01:47:43,359
- Forget it.
- Anything goes.

1372
01:47:43,440 --> 01:47:47,353
They been around 1,000 years.
They got all the angles figured out.

1373
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:50,718
You know what capitalism is?
Getting fucked.

1374
01:47:50,840 --> 01:47:52,876
True capitalist if ever I met one.

1375
01:47:54,680 --> 01:47:56,352
Did you hear that?

1376
01:47:57,600 --> 01:47:59,511
How would you know, bubblehead?

1377
01:48:00,200 --> 01:48:02,668
You ever do nothing
besides get your hair fixed...

1378
01:48:02,760 --> 01:48:03,954
and powder your nose?

1379
01:48:04,120 --> 01:48:06,554
Look at you.
You do too much of that shit.

1380
01:48:06,640 --> 01:48:08,676
Nothing exceeds like excess.

1381
01:48:09,120 --> 01:48:12,510
- You should know that, Tony.
- I should know what?

1382
01:48:13,720 --> 01:48:15,153
What should I know?

1383
01:48:15,280 --> 01:48:17,794
Why do you have to talk to me
like that all the time?

1384
01:48:17,880 --> 01:48:20,678
- Like I got to know something.
- Let me talk to you.

1385
01:48:20,960 --> 01:48:22,439
Listen.
What time is it?

1386
01:48:22,520 --> 01:48:23,748
This Seidelbaum.

1387
01:48:23,920 --> 01:48:25,114
6:55.

1388
01:48:25,280 --> 01:48:27,555
Okay.
I met with this Seidelbaum...

1389
01:48:27,640 --> 01:48:30,950
<i>The drug-related violence
that's plagued South Florida...</i>

1390
01:48:31,400 --> 01:48:33,595
He's good for a laugh, this guy.

1391
01:48:33,680 --> 01:48:37,468
<i>With a small law-enforcement
budget, how can you put a dent...</i>

1392
01:48:37,800 --> 01:48:42,191
<i>on an estimated
$100-billion-a-year business?</i>

1393
01:48:42,880 --> 01:48:44,677
<i>It seems at times all you can do...</i>

1394
01:48:44,760 --> 01:48:46,716
<i>is put your finger in the dike
and pray.</i>

1395
01:48:46,800 --> 01:48:48,552
Put your fingers in a dyke?

1396
01:48:48,880 --> 01:48:51,030
<i>The only place
you can get your fingers...</i>

1397
01:48:51,120 --> 01:48:52,439
is in some dyke.

1398
01:48:53,240 --> 01:48:57,836
<i>Not by outlawing the substances,
but by legalizing and taxing them.</i>

1399
01:48:58,160 --> 01:49:03,075
<i>These voices say that will drive out
the organized crime element.</i>

1400
01:49:03,720 --> 01:49:05,790
<i>I am not one of those voices.</i>

1401
01:49:05,880 --> 01:49:07,518
I know that. But you know why?

1402
01:49:07,600 --> 01:49:10,319
<i>'Cause you got your head
up your culo, that's why.</i>

1403
01:49:10,400 --> 01:49:12,630
That fucking guy,
he never tells the truth.

1404
01:49:12,720 --> 01:49:15,678
<i>... splendor of our city
at its best.</i>

1405
01:49:15,960 --> 01:49:17,552
It's those guys, man!

1406
01:49:17,640 --> 01:49:19,710
It's the fucking bankers,
the politicians...

1407
01:49:19,800 --> 01:49:21,950
they're the ones
that wanna make coke illegal!

1408
01:49:22,040 --> 01:49:25,316
<i>So they can make the fucking money,
and then get the fucking votes!</i>

1409
01:49:25,400 --> 01:49:28,472
They fighting the bad guys.
They're the bad guys!

1410
01:49:28,760 --> 01:49:30,557
They fuck anything and anyone.

1411
01:49:30,640 --> 01:49:33,598
Can't you stop saying "fuck"
all the time?

1412
01:49:33,760 --> 01:49:36,320
Can't you stop talking about money?
It's boring, Tony.

1413
01:49:36,400 --> 01:49:40,279
Where's this coming from?
Boring? What's boring?

1414
01:49:40,400 --> 01:49:41,913
You're boring.

1415
01:49:42,360 --> 01:49:45,477
"Money."
That's all I hear in this house.

1416
01:49:45,720 --> 01:49:48,598
Look at these pelicans fly.
Come on, pelicans!

1417
01:49:48,680 --> 01:49:51,240
- Here it is.
- Frank never talked about money.

1418
01:49:55,440 --> 01:49:57,795
That's 'cause he was so smart.

1419
01:50:04,760 --> 01:50:06,352
You know what you're becoming?

1420
01:50:06,440 --> 01:50:09,716
You're an immigrant spic millionaire
who can't stop talking...

1421
01:50:09,800 --> 01:50:13,031
Who the fuck you calling a "spic,"
you white piece of bread?

1422
01:50:13,120 --> 01:50:14,553
<i>Get out of the way of the TV!</i>

1423
01:50:14,640 --> 01:50:17,279
Dig a hole in the yard,
bury it, and forget about it.

1424
01:50:17,520 --> 01:50:20,637
I work hard for this!
I want you to know that.

1425
01:50:24,400 --> 01:50:28,154
Somebody should've given it to you.
You would've been a nicer person.

1426
01:50:30,200 --> 01:50:32,156
Know what your problem is, pussycat?

1427
01:50:32,240 --> 01:50:33,753
What is my problem?

1428
01:50:34,480 --> 01:50:36,869
You got nothing to do
with your life.

1429
01:50:37,960 --> 01:50:40,599
Why don't you get a job
or something?

1430
01:50:41,080 --> 01:50:42,911
Do something. Be a nurse.

1431
01:50:43,720 --> 01:50:46,473
Work with blind kids, lepers.
That kind of thing.

1432
01:50:47,840 --> 01:50:51,435
Anything beats lying around all day
waiting for me to fuck you!

1433
01:50:52,040 --> 01:50:54,429
Don't toot your horn, honey.
You're not that good.

1434
01:50:54,520 --> 01:50:56,556
No? Frank was better?

1435
01:50:57,800 --> 01:50:59,233
You're an asshole!

1436
01:51:00,080 --> 01:51:01,957
Where you going? Come here!

1437
01:51:02,600 --> 01:51:04,750
Elvie!

1438
01:51:05,440 --> 01:51:06,714
I was kidding!

1439
01:51:07,640 --> 01:51:09,232
I was only kidding!

1440
01:51:09,720 --> 01:51:13,759
I guess sometimes married life
is not all it's cracked up to be.

1441
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,434
- Where you going?
- I got a date.

1442
01:51:17,280 --> 01:51:18,838
You got a date? Come here.

1443
01:51:23,760 --> 01:51:26,433
- What?
- This Seidelbaum thing.

1444
01:51:27,520 --> 01:51:29,033
Yeah, it's all set up.

1445
01:51:29,480 --> 01:51:31,311
Yeah, well, you forget it.

1446
01:51:31,400 --> 01:51:33,311
<i>Stay out of it.
I'll take care of it.</i>

1447
01:51:33,400 --> 01:51:36,039
Stay out of it? It's my deal.
I set it up.

1448
01:51:36,320 --> 01:51:38,595
You're not a negotiator,
Manny, you know that.

1449
01:51:38,680 --> 01:51:40,989
<i>You like the ladies
more than the money.</i>

1450
01:51:41,080 --> 01:51:42,069
That's your problem.

1451
01:51:42,160 --> 01:51:44,958
What the fuck are you talking about?
I'm your partner, okay?

1452
01:51:45,040 --> 01:51:47,349
If you don't trust me
with that kind of thing...

1453
01:51:47,440 --> 01:51:48,919
who're you gonna trust?

1454
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:50,194
Junior partner.

1455
01:51:51,600 --> 01:51:52,635
Bullshit, man.

1456
01:51:52,720 --> 01:51:54,995
Don't talk to me about trust,
I don't like it.

1457
01:51:55,680 --> 01:51:58,035
You should listen to your wife.
She's right.

1458
01:51:58,120 --> 01:51:59,758
You are an asshole, man!

1459
01:52:00,680 --> 01:52:02,910
Come here. Give me a kiss.
Come here.

1460
01:52:04,080 --> 01:52:05,479
Fuck you, man!

1461
01:52:06,520 --> 01:52:09,876
Who put this thing together?
Me! That's who!

1462
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:13,116
Who do I trust? Me!

1463
01:52:13,720 --> 01:52:15,597
Fuck him. "Trust."

1464
01:52:18,360 --> 01:52:21,352
Asshole. Fuck called me an asshole.

1465
01:52:22,200 --> 01:52:23,553
I need that shit.

1466
01:52:25,120 --> 01:52:26,599
I don't need him.

1467
01:52:27,560 --> 01:52:31,235
I don't need her. Fuck them.
I don't need nobody.

1468
01:52:32,280 --> 01:52:34,748
Back then I worked in pictures
down in Colombia.

1469
01:52:34,840 --> 01:52:37,513
<i>I was in that movie Burn.
You ever see it?</i>

1470
01:52:37,880 --> 01:52:41,190
You saw me with Marlon Brando?
You know, we're good friends.

1471
01:52:41,280 --> 01:52:43,589
- I was his driver.
- No shit?

1472
01:52:43,680 --> 01:52:47,229
- Brando.
- They shot it there. Cartagena.

1473
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:49,797
Gillo Pontecorvo.
He was the director.

1474
01:52:49,880 --> 01:52:50,949
Italian guy.

1475
01:52:51,040 --> 01:52:54,589
- Tell me about him.
- I also know Paul Newman.

1476
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:57,036
- I worked with him in Tucson.
- No kidding?

1477
01:52:57,120 --> 01:52:59,031
Do you know Benny Alvarez?

1478
01:52:59,160 --> 01:53:01,515
In Tucson. Benny Alvarez?

1479
01:53:01,880 --> 01:53:04,474
- Subtotal.
- No?

1480
01:53:07,080 --> 01:53:08,433
He's a nice guy.

1481
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:12,834
$283,107.65.

1482
01:53:15,520 --> 01:53:17,431
You want a company cheque here?

1483
01:53:18,840 --> 01:53:22,628
I got $284,600.

1484
01:53:22,760 --> 01:53:26,036
That's just not possible.
The machine don't make mistakes.

1485
01:53:29,480 --> 01:53:31,550
- Let's count it again.
- No. Come on.

1486
01:53:31,640 --> 01:53:34,871
Business is business. Come on.
You're talking $1,500 here.

1487
01:53:35,920 --> 01:53:38,912
Okay, you keep the change.
Okay? I don't give a shit.

1488
01:53:40,600 --> 01:53:42,795
- I'll count it again for you.
- No, come on.

1489
01:53:42,880 --> 01:53:45,553
This cheque here,
where does this check go?

1490
01:53:48,840 --> 01:53:51,229
- Montana Realty Company.
- Montana what?

1491
01:53:51,640 --> 01:53:53,232
Montana Realty Company.

1492
01:53:53,360 --> 01:53:56,909
Montana Realty Company.

1493
01:53:57,160 --> 01:54:00,630
That's $284,000.
$284,600.

1494
01:54:01,560 --> 01:54:03,994
How come you don't know
Benny Alvarez?

1495
01:54:04,080 --> 01:54:08,358
Me and Benny have lunch together.
He probably knows me.

1496
01:54:08,880 --> 01:54:10,359
<i>You ask him.</i>

1497
01:54:27,640 --> 01:54:29,153
We're up to what?

1498
01:54:30,640 --> 01:54:36,476
Seven cheques. $1,325,623.

1499
01:54:39,160 --> 01:54:41,151
$200,000 more.

1500
01:54:41,240 --> 01:54:43,356
- We ought to take a leak.
- Freeze!

1501
01:54:43,440 --> 01:54:44,714
Get your hands up!

1502
01:54:44,800 --> 01:54:46,313
Go against the wall, turn around.

1503
01:54:46,400 --> 01:54:47,389
You're not kidding.

1504
01:54:47,480 --> 01:54:50,552
You're under arrest
for violation of the RICO Statute.

1505
01:54:50,640 --> 01:54:52,232
"You have the right
to remain silent.

1506
01:54:52,320 --> 01:54:54,788
"Anything you say
can and will be taken against you."

1507
01:54:54,880 --> 01:54:58,190
How do I know you guys are cops?
What's that say, asshole?

1508
01:54:59,600 --> 01:55:02,478
That's pretty good, man.
Where'd you get that?

1509
01:55:02,600 --> 01:55:05,797
You call yourself a Cuban?
You make a real Cuban throw up!

1510
01:55:05,880 --> 01:55:07,950
Call your dog off me, Seidelbaum.

1511
01:55:08,320 --> 01:55:11,357
I want to call my lawyer.
Lot of good he'll do.

1512
01:55:11,520 --> 01:55:13,670
You see that eye there in the clock?

1513
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:15,877
<i>Say, "Hi, honey."</i>

1514
01:55:16,520 --> 01:55:18,829
<i>That's pretty cute. Look at that.</i>

1515
01:55:18,920 --> 01:55:21,036
<i>You jerk off in front of us,
Seidelbaum?</i>

1516
01:55:21,120 --> 01:55:23,350
<i>I was supposed to meet this
chick at 3:00.</i>

1517
01:55:23,440 --> 01:55:25,192
<i>You're a fucking pain in the ass.</i>

1518
01:55:25,520 --> 01:55:27,238
<i>All right, Benny, kill it.</i>

1519
01:55:28,160 --> 01:55:30,628
You understand the rights
I've given you?

1520
01:55:30,800 --> 01:55:32,870
I know all that bullshit,
Seidelbaum!

1521
01:55:32,960 --> 01:55:34,279
Save your breath.

1522
01:55:34,560 --> 01:55:37,199
You got nothing on me.
You know it. I know it.

1523
01:55:37,680 --> 01:55:39,910
I'm changing dollar bills,
that's all.

1524
01:55:40,280 --> 01:55:43,511
You want to waste my time?
Okay. I call my lawyer.

1525
01:55:44,200 --> 01:55:47,909
He's the best lawyer in Miami.
He's such a good lawyer...

1526
01:55:48,440 --> 01:55:52,115
that by tomorrow morning,
you gonna be working in Alaska.

1527
01:55:53,760 --> 01:55:55,034
So dress warm.

1528
01:55:59,120 --> 01:56:02,874
Give me a cheque
for $100,000, plus $300,000 in cash.

1529
01:56:03,480 --> 01:56:06,074
I guarantee you walk
on the conspiracy charge.

1530
01:56:06,920 --> 01:56:09,798
They're gonna come back at us
on a tax evasion...

1531
01:56:10,840 --> 01:56:12,558
and they'll get it.

1532
01:56:16,320 --> 01:56:18,550
So, what am I looking at here?

1533
01:56:20,760 --> 01:56:22,876
Five years. You'll be out in three.

1534
01:56:22,960 --> 01:56:25,520
<i>Maybe less, if I can make a deal.</i>

1535
01:56:27,080 --> 01:56:28,559
Three fucking years!

1536
01:56:30,840 --> 01:56:32,068
For what?

1537
01:56:33,080 --> 01:56:36,436
Washing money? The fucking country
was built on washed money.

1538
01:56:36,520 --> 01:56:37,839
Can't be that bad.

1539
01:56:37,920 --> 01:56:40,275
- It's not like Cuba.
- What the fuck you talking?

1540
01:56:40,360 --> 01:56:43,432
- The jails are like hotels.
- You kidding me or what?

1541
01:56:43,520 --> 01:56:46,239
You fucking high?
I'll delay the trial.

1542
01:56:46,480 --> 01:56:49,438
A year and a half, two years.
You won't even start...

1543
01:56:49,520 --> 01:56:50,635
Fuck you, man!

1544
01:56:50,720 --> 01:56:52,631
I'm not going back
in any cage, okay?

1545
01:56:52,720 --> 01:56:54,472
<i>No way. I been there.</i>

1546
01:56:59,880 --> 01:57:01,199
Okay, look.

1547
01:57:03,400 --> 01:57:07,473
I give you $400,000 more.
Okay, now that's $800,000.

1548
01:57:07,920 --> 01:57:10,957
With that kind of money,
you can buy the Supreme Court.

1549
01:57:13,480 --> 01:57:16,790
Tony, the law has to prove
beyond a reasonable doubt.

1550
01:57:17,720 --> 01:57:21,713
I'm an expert at raising that doubt.
But when you got $1,300,000...

1551
01:57:21,840 --> 01:57:24,912
undeclared
staring into a videotape camera...

1552
01:57:25,560 --> 01:57:29,394
honey baby, it's hard to convince
a jury you found it in a taxicab.

1553
01:57:52,040 --> 01:57:54,474
I'm so glad you could come
on such short notice.

1554
01:57:54,560 --> 01:57:55,629
I really appreciate it.

1555
01:57:55,720 --> 01:57:57,358
- It's okay.
- How's Elvira?

1556
01:57:57,640 --> 01:58:00,598
- Great. How's your wife?
- Three more months.

1557
01:58:00,760 --> 01:58:03,069
- Yeah? Congratulations.
- How about you?

1558
01:58:03,160 --> 01:58:05,754
When you gonna have another Tony
to take your place?

1559
01:58:05,840 --> 01:58:08,718
- I'm working on it.
- You have to work harder. Come.

1560
01:58:08,880 --> 01:58:11,155
<i>I want you to meet
some of my friends.</i>

1561
01:58:15,880 --> 01:58:17,108
This is Pedro Quinn...

1562
01:58:17,200 --> 01:58:19,111
chairman of
the Andes Sugar Corporation.

1563
01:58:19,200 --> 01:58:21,589
- Pleasure meeting you.
- Nice to meet you.

1564
01:58:21,680 --> 01:58:24,911
General Edward Strasser,
Commander of the First Army Corps.

1565
01:58:26,360 --> 01:58:27,509
Pleasure.

1566
01:58:27,600 --> 01:58:29,556
This is Ariel Bleyer...

1567
01:58:29,680 --> 01:58:32,513
with the Ministry of the Interior.
Tony Montana.

1568
01:58:34,600 --> 01:58:38,354
And here is our friend
Charles Goodson from Washington.

1569
01:58:38,640 --> 01:58:41,154
- Nice to meet you.
- How do you do, Mr. Montana?

1570
01:58:42,160 --> 01:58:43,593
Sit here, Tony.

1571
01:58:47,200 --> 01:58:48,428
<i>Gentlemen.</i>

1572
01:58:52,200 --> 01:58:54,031
I would like to discuss something...

1573
01:58:54,120 --> 01:58:56,031
that is of interest
to all of us here.

1574
01:58:57,280 --> 01:58:58,952
You have a problem, Tony.

1575
01:58:59,760 --> 01:59:02,832
We have a problem.

1576
01:59:03,960 --> 01:59:06,599
I think together
we can solve all our problems.

1577
01:59:08,760 --> 01:59:11,194
<i>We all know you have tax troubles
in your country...</i>

1578
01:59:11,280 --> 01:59:13,874
<i>and that you may have to do
a little time.</i>

1579
01:59:14,480 --> 01:59:15,993
<i>We have friends in Washington...</i>

1580
01:59:16,080 --> 01:59:19,038
that assure us these troubles
can be taken care of.

1581
01:59:19,120 --> 01:59:22,510
You may have to pay some back taxes,
a big fine...

1582
01:59:23,280 --> 01:59:25,271
but there will be no prison.

1583
01:59:25,920 --> 01:59:26,909
Okay.

1584
01:59:27,800 --> 01:59:29,677
So what's your problem, Alex?

1585
01:59:30,680 --> 01:59:32,398
I'll show you my problem.

1586
01:59:32,920 --> 01:59:34,592
<i>I've heard about financial...</i>

1587
01:59:34,680 --> 01:59:35,954
<i>support the government receives...</i>

1588
01:59:36,040 --> 01:59:37,792
<i>from the drug industry in Bolivia.</i>

1589
01:59:37,880 --> 01:59:41,031
<i>Well, the irony of this
is that this money...</i>

1590
01:59:41,120 --> 01:59:42,599
<i>which is in the billions...</i>

1591
01:59:42,800 --> 01:59:44,472
<i>is coming from your country.</i>

1592
01:59:44,560 --> 01:59:48,235
<i>You are the major purchaser
of our national product...</i>

1593
01:59:48,320 --> 01:59:50,038
<i>which is cocaine.</i>

1594
01:59:50,120 --> 01:59:52,270
<i>You're saying
the U.S. Government...</i>

1595
01:59:52,360 --> 01:59:56,478
<i>is spending millions to eliminate
the flow of drugs onto our streets.</i>

1596
01:59:56,760 --> 01:59:58,318
<i>At the same time...</i>

1597
01:59:58,400 --> 02:00:01,153
<i>we are doing business
with the same government...</i>

1598
02:00:01,360 --> 02:00:03,794
<i>that is flooding our streets
with cocaine.</i>

1599
02:00:04,120 --> 02:00:06,588
<i>Let me show you
a few of the other characters...</i>

1600
02:00:06,680 --> 02:00:08,830
<i>that are involved
in this tragic comedy.</i>

1601
02:00:08,920 --> 02:00:13,994
<i>My organization just recently traced
a large purchase by this man.</i>

1602
02:00:14,640 --> 02:00:18,076
<i>This charming face here
belongs to General Cucombre.</i>

1603
02:00:18,360 --> 02:00:21,477
<i>He is the Minister of the Defense
of Bolivia, my country.</i>

1604
02:00:21,960 --> 02:00:24,269
<i>And General Cucombre just
a couple months ago...</i>

1605
02:00:24,360 --> 02:00:28,558
<i>bought a $12 million villa
on Lake Lucerne in Switzerland.</i>

1606
02:00:28,640 --> 02:00:31,837
<i>Now, if Cucombre is supposed to be
the Bolivian Defense Minister...</i>

1607
02:00:31,920 --> 02:00:34,070
<i>what is he doing
living in Switzerland?</i>

1608
02:00:34,160 --> 02:00:35,593
<i>Guarding cash registers?</i>

1609
02:00:36,640 --> 02:00:40,792
<i>This man here, Alejandro Sosa,
a very interesting character.</i>

1610
02:00:41,040 --> 02:00:42,632
<i>He's a wealthy landowner...</i>

1611
02:00:42,720 --> 02:00:45,188
<i>educated in England,
very good family.</i>

1612
02:00:45,480 --> 02:00:49,314
<i>But this man is the business brain
and drug overlord...</i>

1613
02:00:49,560 --> 02:00:52,199
<i>of an empire that stretches
across the Andes.</i>

1614
02:00:52,280 --> 02:00:54,714
<i>He's not your ordinary drug dealer.</i>

1615
02:00:55,280 --> 02:00:57,794
<i>Well, discussing it openly...</i>

1616
02:00:58,880 --> 02:01:01,235
<i>He's scheduled for 60 Minutes next.</i>

1617
02:01:01,800 --> 02:01:07,113
He is going on French, British,
Italian, Japanese television.

1618
02:01:07,680 --> 02:01:10,478
People everywhere
are starting to listen to him.

1619
02:01:10,920 --> 02:01:12,558
It's embarrassing, Tony.

1620
02:01:14,680 --> 02:01:16,875
That is our problem.

1621
02:01:19,400 --> 02:01:21,550
You remember Alberto, don't you?

1622
02:01:22,840 --> 02:01:24,478
How could I forget him?

1623
02:01:25,160 --> 02:01:28,391
Alberto is an expert
in the disposal business.

1624
02:01:29,360 --> 02:01:31,635
He's going to help us
fix our problem.

1625
02:01:33,360 --> 02:01:35,237
But he doesn't speak English.

1626
02:01:35,960 --> 02:01:38,838
He doesn't know his way
around the States too well.

1627
02:01:39,080 --> 02:01:40,957
He needs a little help.

1628
02:01:43,080 --> 02:01:44,911
Is that a problem, Tony?

1629
02:01:50,600 --> 02:01:52,158
No problem.

1630
02:01:54,600 --> 02:01:55,669
Good.

1631
02:02:10,280 --> 02:02:14,114
So what's the big mystery
with the Bolivian situation?

1632
02:02:14,480 --> 02:02:17,358
You gonna tell me what happened
with Sosa, or what?

1633
02:02:17,600 --> 02:02:20,717
A lot of bullshit,
that's what happened.

1634
02:02:21,600 --> 02:02:22,715
Politics.

1635
02:02:27,280 --> 02:02:30,431
I want you to stay down here
for a while.

1636
02:02:31,600 --> 02:02:33,238
Run things for me.

1637
02:02:33,960 --> 02:02:36,030
I gotta go to New York next week.

1638
02:02:42,120 --> 02:02:43,348
Fuck this, man.

1639
02:02:43,440 --> 02:02:46,238
I don't like it, man.
I don't like this at all.

1640
02:02:46,320 --> 02:02:47,912
You don't like it?

1641
02:02:50,840 --> 02:02:53,991
You got me into this mess
in the first place.

1642
02:02:54,080 --> 02:02:57,629
With that fucking Seidelbaum,
that right?

1643
02:02:57,720 --> 02:02:59,039
With Seidelbaum?

1644
02:02:59,120 --> 02:03:01,236
What does Seidelbaum
have to do with Sosa?

1645
02:03:01,320 --> 02:03:03,959
How do you connect those two?

1646
02:03:04,360 --> 02:03:06,874
Why don't you eat your food?
What's wrong with it?

1647
02:03:06,960 --> 02:03:08,916
I'm not hungry.

1648
02:03:09,560 --> 02:03:12,438
You're not hungry?
Do you know about the trial?

1649
02:03:12,600 --> 02:03:16,559
- What did you order it for, then?
- I lost my appetite.

1650
02:03:21,520 --> 02:03:25,149
Do you even know that Sheffield said
he can get you a postponement?

1651
02:03:32,240 --> 02:03:36,233
Is this it?
That's what it's all about?

1652
02:03:39,320 --> 02:03:42,596
Eating, drinking...

1653
02:03:43,080 --> 02:03:45,150
fucking, sucking...

1654
02:03:45,240 --> 02:03:47,879
- Come on, man.
- Snorting?

1655
02:03:47,960 --> 02:03:49,075
Then what?

1656
02:03:50,680 --> 02:03:52,432
Tell me. Then what?

1657
02:03:53,360 --> 02:03:57,672
You're 50.
You got a bag for a belly.

1658
02:03:59,040 --> 02:04:01,679
You got tits, you need a bra.

1659
02:04:02,480 --> 02:04:03,993
They got hair on them.

1660
02:04:05,160 --> 02:04:08,391
You got a liver,
and they got spots on it...

1661
02:04:08,480 --> 02:04:10,436
and you're eating
this fucking shit...

1662
02:04:10,920 --> 02:04:14,310
and you're looking like
these rich fucking mummies in here.

1663
02:04:14,520 --> 02:04:17,114
Come on. It's not so bad.
It could be worse.

1664
02:04:17,760 --> 02:04:20,149
- Is this what it's all about?
- Forget it.

1665
02:04:20,320 --> 02:04:23,198
This what I work for? Tell me.

1666
02:04:28,520 --> 02:04:29,714
Look at that.

1667
02:04:30,760 --> 02:04:32,034
A junkie.

1668
02:04:33,760 --> 02:04:37,958
I got a fucking junkie for a wife.
She don't eat nothing.

1669
02:04:39,080 --> 02:04:42,675
Sleeps all day
with them black shades on.

1670
02:04:44,280 --> 02:04:46,874
- Wakes up with a Quaalude...
- Don't pick on her, man.

1671
02:04:46,960 --> 02:04:50,509
...and who won't fuck me
'cause she's in a coma.

1672
02:04:52,120 --> 02:04:54,475
I can't even have a kid with her.

1673
02:04:54,560 --> 02:04:57,154
Her womb is so polluted...

1674
02:04:57,240 --> 02:05:00,118
I can't even have
a fucking little baby with her!

1675
02:05:00,200 --> 02:05:02,430
You son of a bitch!

1676
02:05:03,320 --> 02:05:04,912
You fuck!

1677
02:05:05,280 --> 02:05:08,829
- You shouldn't talk like that.
- How dare you talk to me like that!

1678
02:05:10,080 --> 02:05:12,355
What makes you
so much better than me?

1679
02:05:12,760 --> 02:05:14,034
- What do you do?
- Don't worry.

1680
02:05:14,120 --> 02:05:17,556
You deal drugs and you kill people.
That's wonderful, Tony.

1681
02:05:18,200 --> 02:05:20,475
Real contribution to human history.

1682
02:05:20,560 --> 02:05:23,279
- Go ahead. Tell everybody.
- You want a kid?

1683
02:05:23,360 --> 02:05:24,634
Tell the world.

1684
02:05:24,720 --> 02:05:27,473
What kind of a father
would you make?

1685
02:05:28,800 --> 02:05:31,155
Gonna drive him to school
in the mornings?

1686
02:05:31,240 --> 02:05:34,676
Are you even gonna be alive
by the time the kid goes to school?

1687
02:05:36,120 --> 02:05:38,998
- You don't know how to be a husband!
- Sit down before I...

1688
02:05:39,080 --> 02:05:41,469
Do we ever go anywhere
without having 600 thugs...

1689
02:05:41,560 --> 02:05:43,152
hanging around all the time?

1690
02:05:43,560 --> 02:05:47,109
I have Nick "The Pig" as a friend.

1691
02:05:48,560 --> 02:05:51,438
What kind of life is that?

1692
02:05:55,720 --> 02:05:57,119
Can't you see...

1693
02:05:59,360 --> 02:06:01,954
what we're becoming, Tony?
We're losers.

1694
02:06:02,880 --> 02:06:05,030
<i>We're not winners, we're losers.</i>

1695
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:09,913
- Go home. You're stoned.
- I'm not stoned, you're stoned.

1696
02:06:10,160 --> 02:06:12,469
- Get her out of here.
- Come on.

1697
02:06:14,760 --> 02:06:16,557
I'm not going home with you.

1698
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:19,991
I'm not going home with anybody.

1699
02:06:21,760 --> 02:06:23,239
I'm going home alone.

1700
02:06:28,680 --> 02:06:29,954
I'm leaving you.

1701
02:06:32,360 --> 02:06:34,271
I don't need this shit anymore.

1702
02:06:34,760 --> 02:06:37,718
Okay, but I'll walk you out.
I'll take her home in a cab.

1703
02:06:37,800 --> 02:06:39,916
Let her go.

1704
02:06:40,520 --> 02:06:43,239
Another Quaalude,
she gonna love me again.

1705
02:06:50,520 --> 02:06:52,033
What're you looking at?

1706
02:06:58,720 --> 02:07:00,995
You're all a bunch
of fucking assholes.

1707
02:07:02,280 --> 02:07:03,713
You know why?

1708
02:07:05,520 --> 02:07:08,637
You don't have the guts
to be what you want to be.

1709
02:07:12,040 --> 02:07:14,270
You need people like me.

1710
02:07:19,720 --> 02:07:21,199
You need people like me...

1711
02:07:21,280 --> 02:07:23,874
so you can point
your fucking fingers...

1712
02:07:24,400 --> 02:07:26,630
and say, "That's the bad guy."

1713
02:07:29,480 --> 02:07:30,595
So...

1714
02:07:31,520 --> 02:07:33,078
what does that make you?

1715
02:07:33,680 --> 02:07:34,669
Good?

1716
02:07:37,440 --> 02:07:39,112
You're not good.

1717
02:07:41,240 --> 02:07:43,071
You just know how to hide...

1718
02:07:44,720 --> 02:07:45,948
how to lie.

1719
02:07:48,520 --> 02:07:51,796
Me, I don't have that problem.

1720
02:07:53,440 --> 02:07:56,512
Me, I always tell the truth.

1721
02:07:58,160 --> 02:07:59,798
Even when I lie.

1722
02:08:08,600 --> 02:08:11,034
So say good night to the bad guy!

1723
02:08:11,640 --> 02:08:12,834
Come on.

1724
02:08:14,960 --> 02:08:17,713
The last time you gonna see
a bad guy like this again...

1725
02:08:17,800 --> 02:08:19,119
let me tell you.

1726
02:08:20,280 --> 02:08:23,511
Come on. Make way for the bad guy.

1727
02:08:24,920 --> 02:08:27,309
<i>There's a bad guy coming through!</i>

1728
02:08:28,040 --> 02:08:29,632
<i>Better get out of his way!</i>

1729
02:08:32,760 --> 02:08:36,753
NEW YORK CITY

1730
02:09:53,560 --> 02:09:57,109
No. You tell Sheffield to keep
his nose out of it.

1731
02:09:57,320 --> 02:10:00,517
<i>There's gonna be no trial.
I got it all under control now.</i>

1732
02:10:00,920 --> 02:10:02,911
<i>Just tell him to stay out of it!</i>

1733
02:10:03,440 --> 02:10:05,749
<i>Okay, what about Elvira?
Did she call?</i>

1734
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:10,353
Yeah, all right.

1735
02:10:25,160 --> 02:10:26,832
Tony, everything go okay?

1736
02:10:27,160 --> 02:10:28,878
Yeah, everything is roses.

1737
02:10:32,600 --> 02:10:34,158
Ernie, what time do you got?

1738
02:10:34,520 --> 02:10:36,988
- Ten to.
- Ten to.

1739
02:10:37,280 --> 02:10:39,191
- Where is this guy?
- I gotta call Manny.

1740
02:10:40,360 --> 02:10:41,349
Sit down.

1741
02:10:41,440 --> 02:10:42,953
You don't tell me what to do here!

1742
02:10:43,040 --> 02:10:45,190
He's coming out.
He's coming.

1743
02:10:46,480 --> 02:10:48,755
- I don't give a fuck.
- It's him, man.

1744
02:10:51,360 --> 02:10:53,954
We do it
in front of the United Nations.

1745
02:10:54,040 --> 02:10:55,871
That's how they want it.

1746
02:10:55,960 --> 02:10:58,076
I don't care where you blow him up.

1747
02:10:58,680 --> 02:11:00,113
<i>Tell me when, okay?</i>

1748
02:11:01,840 --> 02:11:04,559
<i>You just tell me when.
That's all I care about.</i>

1749
02:11:08,360 --> 02:11:11,875
I want you to stay thirty meters
behind the car, okay?

1750
02:11:12,720 --> 02:11:14,278
Thirty meters. No more.

1751
02:11:14,360 --> 02:11:16,396
I heard you the first time.

1752
02:11:16,480 --> 02:11:18,277
One time.
That's all you gotta tell me.

1753
02:11:19,440 --> 02:11:21,431
I told you thirty meters.

1754
02:11:22,400 --> 02:11:24,550
This fucking guy, I'm telling you.

1755
02:11:27,080 --> 02:11:28,752
Look. Here he comes.

1756
02:11:31,560 --> 02:11:33,551
Where's he going?

1757
02:11:33,760 --> 02:11:35,398
<i>What's he doing that way?</i>

1758
02:11:46,320 --> 02:11:47,912
What the fuck he doing?

1759
02:12:01,160 --> 02:12:03,151
What the fuck is that? Come here.

1760
02:12:03,240 --> 02:12:05,231
You said she took the kids
in the other car!

1761
02:12:05,320 --> 02:12:09,029
She did, every fucking day.
I don't know what's going on.

1762
02:12:11,160 --> 02:12:14,516
No fucking way.
No fucking way. That's it!

1763
02:12:15,880 --> 02:12:17,154
Forget it!

1764
02:12:17,760 --> 02:12:21,639
We kill this guy alone.
No wife, no kids.

1765
02:12:22,320 --> 02:12:26,598
No way. If Sosa says we do it now,
we do it now. Let's go.

1766
02:12:27,160 --> 02:12:29,037
This fucking guy.

1767
02:12:57,760 --> 02:13:00,479
Okay, just stay behind him.

1768
02:13:01,760 --> 02:13:04,558
Slowly, slowly.

1769
02:13:04,760 --> 02:13:06,273
Fuck you, you fucking vulture.

1770
02:13:07,440 --> 02:13:08,953
Okay. Easy.

1771
02:13:10,640 --> 02:13:14,519
Two little kids in the car.
This is so fucking bad.

1772
02:13:15,320 --> 02:13:16,833
<i>This is so fucking bad.</i>

1773
02:13:18,040 --> 02:13:20,873
You're losing them. Look!
You're losing them!

1774
02:13:20,960 --> 02:13:22,757
I see them, all right? I see them!

1775
02:13:23,960 --> 02:13:26,155
Ten meters, ten meters!

1776
02:13:26,560 --> 02:13:28,357
Move it. Move it!

1777
02:13:28,440 --> 02:13:30,078
Shut the fuck up, okay?

1778
02:13:42,120 --> 02:13:45,635
You don't have the guts to look them
in the eye when you kill them.

1779
02:13:45,800 --> 02:13:47,199
You gotta hide with that shit...

1780
02:13:47,280 --> 02:13:48,269
Shut your mouth.

1781
02:13:48,360 --> 02:13:49,998
He's getting up. Let's do it.

1782
02:13:50,080 --> 02:13:51,638
Make you feel good?

1783
02:13:52,120 --> 02:13:54,998
Make you feel good to kill a mama
and her kids. Make you feel big.

1784
02:13:56,160 --> 02:13:57,149
Shut your mouth!

1785
02:13:57,240 --> 02:13:58,639
Like you, big man! Fuck you!

1786
02:13:59,280 --> 02:14:00,633
<i>What do you think I am?</i>

1787
02:14:00,720 --> 02:14:02,790
You think I kill two kids
and a woman?

1788
02:14:02,960 --> 02:14:06,236
Fuck that!
I don't need that shit in my life!

1789
02:14:08,480 --> 02:14:10,357
You die, motherfucker!

1790
02:14:15,080 --> 02:14:16,513
What do you think I am?

1791
02:14:16,600 --> 02:14:18,670
You think I'm a fucking worm
like you?

1792
02:14:18,960 --> 02:14:22,350
I told you, man!
I told you, don't fuck with me!

1793
02:14:22,560 --> 02:14:24,755
I told you, no fucking kids!

1794
02:14:24,880 --> 02:14:28,839
No, but you wouldn't listen!
You stupid fuck! Look at you now.

1795
02:14:34,120 --> 02:14:36,315
Nick, where the fuck you been?

1796
02:14:37,560 --> 02:14:38,913
<i>On a delivery?</i>

1797
02:14:39,720 --> 02:14:41,597
Where the hell is Manny?

1798
02:14:41,680 --> 02:14:43,477
I been calling all over.
Where is he?

1799
02:14:43,560 --> 02:14:45,869
I don't know, Tony.

1800
02:14:45,960 --> 02:14:47,712
He's been gone
the last couple of days.

1801
02:14:47,800 --> 02:14:50,155
<i>He didn't say nothing.
He's gone? Where?</i>

1802
02:14:50,240 --> 02:14:53,994
I left him in fucking charge, man!
Where the fuck is he?

1803
02:14:54,120 --> 02:14:56,350
You can't trust nobody anymore!

1804
02:14:56,440 --> 02:14:59,716
I don't know, Tony.
He just took off.

1805
02:14:59,800 --> 02:15:01,950
<i>He didn't say nothing.
He took off?</i>

1806
02:15:02,720 --> 02:15:05,951
<i>Are you all right?
No, I'm not! I'm pissed!</i>

1807
02:15:06,040 --> 02:15:07,155
When I get back there...

1808
02:15:07,240 --> 02:15:09,196
I'll kick some ass
all over the place!

1809
02:15:09,280 --> 02:15:11,999
<i>When you coming back?
I'm coming back tonight!</i>

1810
02:15:12,320 --> 02:15:14,311
This fucking cocksucker.

1811
02:15:14,920 --> 02:15:19,311
Tony, your mama called. Gina's gone.

1812
02:15:20,840 --> 02:15:23,912
<i>Gone? Where?
She got to see you right away.</i>

1813
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:27,549
Tell her I'll call her tonight.

1814
02:15:27,760 --> 02:15:30,797
Listen to me.
What about Elvie? She call?

1815
02:15:30,920 --> 02:15:33,115
<i>No.
No.</i>

1816
02:15:33,200 --> 02:15:34,872
Okay, listen to me.

1817
02:15:34,960 --> 02:15:37,190
If she calls,
just tell her I love her.

1818
02:15:37,280 --> 02:15:39,350
Okay? Just tell her that.

1819
02:16:02,200 --> 02:16:03,952
You hear from Manny?
No.

1820
02:16:04,040 --> 02:16:05,837
Your mama called, she gotta see you.

1821
02:16:05,920 --> 02:16:09,879
Sosa's been ringing every half hour.
He sounds pissed.

1822
02:16:09,960 --> 02:16:12,633
Get him on the phone. Elvie call?
No.

1823
02:16:15,560 --> 02:16:18,393
You keep trying Manny.
I want that cocksucker here.

1824
02:16:18,480 --> 02:16:20,596
- I want him here now! Okay?
- Okay.

1825
02:16:20,680 --> 02:16:23,717
Come on. Go ahead, get him!
Let's go. Come on!

1826
02:16:37,800 --> 02:16:42,032
Yeah? Mama. Yeah, I know.

1827
02:16:42,920 --> 02:16:45,480
They told me.

1828
02:16:45,560 --> 02:16:47,437
Okay. I'm coming over.

1829
02:16:47,520 --> 02:16:50,239
I'll be over to see you.
I'll be over, yeah.

1830
02:16:54,200 --> 02:16:56,077
Put it on the speaker.

1831
02:17:05,720 --> 02:17:07,756
<i>What happened, Tony?</i>

1832
02:17:08,680 --> 02:17:11,478
<i>Alex, how you doing?
What happened?</i>

1833
02:17:11,800 --> 02:17:14,030
We had some problems.

1834
02:17:16,200 --> 02:17:18,509
<i>Alex?
Tony, what happened?</i>

1835
02:17:21,880 --> 02:17:24,030
<i>We had a little problem.
I heard.</i>

1836
02:17:24,120 --> 02:17:25,235
How you hear that?

1837
02:17:25,320 --> 02:17:27,390
Our friend gave a speech at the UN.

1838
02:17:27,480 --> 02:17:30,313
He was not supposed to give
that speech.

1839
02:17:32,520 --> 02:17:35,717
Well, your guy, Alberto,
he's a piece of shit.

1840
02:17:35,800 --> 02:17:37,950
I told him to do something,
he didn't listen...

1841
02:17:38,040 --> 02:17:39,473
so I cancelled his contract.

1842
02:17:39,560 --> 02:17:41,915
My partners and I are pissed off.

1843
02:17:42,440 --> 02:17:44,158
That's okay. No big deal.

1844
02:17:44,360 --> 02:17:47,272
There's other Albertos.
We'll do it next month.

1845
02:17:47,360 --> 02:17:49,351
No, Tony, you can't do that.

1846
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:52,878
They found what was under the car.

1847
02:17:53,720 --> 02:17:56,280
Now our friend has got security
up the ass.

1848
02:17:56,560 --> 02:17:59,950
<i>The heat will come down hard
on my partners and me.</i>

1849
02:18:00,720 --> 02:18:02,597
There's not gonna be a next time...

1850
02:18:02,680 --> 02:18:06,229
<i>- you dumb cocksucker! You blew it!
- Take it easy when you talk to me.</i>

1851
02:18:06,360 --> 02:18:10,990
I told you a long time ago,
you fucking monkey, not to fuck me!

1852
02:18:11,080 --> 02:18:12,957
Who the fuck
you think you're talking to?

1853
02:18:13,040 --> 02:18:14,189
<i>You want to fuck with...</i>

1854
02:18:14,280 --> 02:18:17,556
Who the fuck you think I am,
your fucking bellboy?

1855
02:18:18,480 --> 02:18:21,870
You want to go to war?
We take you to war, okay?

1856
02:18:22,960 --> 02:18:25,269
Alex, you there? Hey!

1857
02:18:25,400 --> 02:18:28,756
<i>He's not there. Cálmate, man.</i>

1858
02:18:30,080 --> 02:18:33,789
She got a place of her own.
She don't tell me where.

1859
02:18:34,040 --> 02:18:36,270
One night, I follow her in a taxi.

1860
02:18:36,360 --> 02:18:38,954
She goes to a fancy house
in Coconut Grove.

1861
02:18:39,960 --> 02:18:41,678
- Where'd she get the money?
- You!

1862
02:18:41,760 --> 02:18:44,638
You were giving her the money!
You see what you do to her?

1863
02:18:44,720 --> 02:18:46,995
- I don't give her that much money.
- You did!

1864
02:18:47,080 --> 02:18:50,072
- One time, $1,000 you gave her.
- Was a guy with her?

1865
02:18:50,760 --> 02:18:52,637
I don't know.

1866
02:18:52,920 --> 02:18:55,036
There was this car in the driveway.

1867
02:18:55,120 --> 02:18:56,792
I know if I go there,
she'll kill me.

1868
02:18:56,880 --> 02:18:59,519
- She's like you.
- Where's the place? Where is it?

1869
02:18:59,720 --> 02:19:02,598
400 something...

1870
02:19:02,680 --> 02:19:03,795
Citrus Drive.

1871
02:19:03,880 --> 02:19:06,155
- 400 what?
- 409, I think.

1872
02:19:06,400 --> 02:19:09,472
You gotta talk to her, Antonio.
She don't listen to me.

1873
02:19:09,560 --> 02:19:11,312
<i>She says to me, "Mira, shut up!</i>

1874
02:19:11,400 --> 02:19:12,594
"Mind your own business."

1875
02:19:12,680 --> 02:19:14,477
Exactly like you do to me.

1876
02:19:14,560 --> 02:19:17,233
Ever since you came back,
she's been getting this way.

1877
02:19:17,360 --> 02:19:19,920
- I gotta go.
- Why do you have to hurt everything?

1878
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:21,956
Why do you have to destroy...

1879
02:19:22,040 --> 02:19:24,235
everything that comes your way?

1880
02:19:28,120 --> 02:19:30,509
409 Citrus Drive.

1881
02:19:30,800 --> 02:19:33,792
- Tony, I can't find Manny anywhere.
- Fuck!

1882
02:19:34,200 --> 02:19:36,873
Okay. Listen, boss, I'll try again.

1883
02:20:08,560 --> 02:20:11,677
You stay here.
Keep trying Manny, okay?

1884
02:22:06,320 --> 02:22:10,711
We got married just yesterday.
We were gonna surprise you.

1885
02:22:16,240 --> 02:22:17,673
Jesus, Tony.

1886
02:22:18,120 --> 02:22:21,430
Tony, we gotta get outta here, man.
We gotta get outta here.

1887
02:22:21,960 --> 02:22:23,552
Go get Gina.

1888
02:22:31,440 --> 02:22:32,509
No!

1889
02:22:38,920 --> 02:22:41,718
No, Gina. Come on, Gina. No!

1890
02:22:41,800 --> 02:22:43,358
God!

1891
02:22:51,360 --> 02:22:53,032
Tony, we can't stay here.
We gotta go.

1892
02:22:53,120 --> 02:22:54,951
We gotta get out of here.

1893
02:23:33,160 --> 02:23:34,513
Come on, Gina.

1894
02:23:37,960 --> 02:23:40,110
Here we go. It's gonna be okay.

1895
02:23:40,240 --> 02:23:42,231
- You got her?
- I got her.

1896
02:24:08,440 --> 02:24:12,149
No! This is Tony's place! Let me go!

1897
02:24:55,320 --> 02:24:58,118
We put some pills into her.
She's gonna be all right, Tony.

1898
02:24:58,200 --> 02:24:59,838
She's cooling down. Right?

1899
02:24:59,920 --> 02:25:02,753
- She's gonna be fine. Just fine.
- Right.

1900
02:25:05,280 --> 02:25:07,032
What are we gonna do now?

1901
02:25:11,320 --> 02:25:12,469
Do?

1902
02:25:17,120 --> 02:25:18,712
We're going to war.

1903
02:25:19,880 --> 02:25:21,950
<i>That's what we're gonna do.</i>

1904
02:25:25,360 --> 02:25:28,318
We're gonna eat that Sosa
for breakfast!

1905
02:25:30,560 --> 02:25:33,074
Close that fucker down.

1906
02:25:38,720 --> 02:25:40,676
Tony, take it easy.

1907
02:25:48,080 --> 02:25:51,277
All right, Ernie. Let's go.
We'll take care of the house.

1908
02:26:59,400 --> 02:27:01,197
Come on.

1909
02:27:01,280 --> 02:27:03,669
This cocksucker's
gonna run all over you.

1910
02:27:19,760 --> 02:27:22,558
Come on.
I'll bury these cocksuckers.

1911
02:27:31,120 --> 02:27:33,680
We gotta get organized here.

1912
02:27:44,400 --> 02:27:47,517
Fuck! Manny.

1913
02:27:54,040 --> 02:27:55,951
How the fuck I do that?

1914
02:27:59,920 --> 02:28:02,229
How the fuck I do that, Manny?

1915
02:28:45,920 --> 02:28:46,909
Manolo.

1916
02:29:38,480 --> 02:29:40,516
Is this what you want, Tony?

1917
02:29:51,240 --> 02:29:54,038
You can't stand for another man
to be touching me.

1918
02:29:56,360 --> 02:29:58,157
So you want me, Tony?

1919
02:30:01,760 --> 02:30:03,193
What are you talking about?

1920
02:30:04,760 --> 02:30:06,159
Is that it?

1921
02:30:09,880 --> 02:30:11,199
Here I am, Tony.

1922
02:30:15,960 --> 02:30:18,076
I am all yours now, Tony, you see?

1923
02:30:20,760 --> 02:30:22,318
I'm all yours now.

1924
02:30:24,920 --> 02:30:27,070
You better come and get me now.

1925
02:30:27,960 --> 02:30:29,791
Come on.
Come and get me.

1926
02:30:29,880 --> 02:30:31,279
Come and get me.

1927
02:30:32,240 --> 02:30:34,913
You do it now before it's too late.

1928
02:30:37,480 --> 02:30:38,629
Come on, Tony.

1929
02:30:40,720 --> 02:30:41,835
Fuck me.

1930
02:30:45,720 --> 02:30:48,029
Fuck me. Come on and just fuck me!

1931
02:31:04,240 --> 02:31:05,229
Die!

1932
02:31:18,800 --> 02:31:21,394
They're all over the place!
Get out of here!

1933
02:31:43,840 --> 02:31:47,833
Come on. Look at your face.
It's all dirty.

1934
02:32:04,680 --> 02:32:06,193
Please talk to me.

1935
02:32:07,960 --> 02:32:09,439
Don't be mad at me.

1936
02:32:09,680 --> 02:32:12,877
Please. Gina, come on.

1937
02:32:14,600 --> 02:32:18,115
I love Manny, you know?

1938
02:32:18,440 --> 02:32:19,634
I love him.

1939
02:32:21,600 --> 02:32:23,989
And I love you, too, you know?

1940
02:32:49,640 --> 02:32:50,868
Give me a smile.

1941
02:32:50,960 --> 02:32:55,078
They're coming from everywhere!
Open up! Open the fucking door!

1942
02:32:56,640 --> 02:32:58,551
<i>Please! Tony!</i>

1943
02:32:58,640 --> 02:33:00,551
<i>Let me in, boss! Please!</i>

1944
02:33:00,760 --> 02:33:02,716
<i>Tony, open the fucking door!</i>

1945
02:33:23,720 --> 02:33:28,635
You wait here, okay?
I'll be with you. I'll be back.

1946
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:34,230
You wait for me. I'm coming back.

1947
02:33:37,960 --> 02:33:40,269
Okay, Sosa.
You want to fuck with me?

1948
02:33:44,720 --> 02:33:46,631
<i>You're fucking with the best!</i>

1949
02:33:50,840 --> 02:33:52,478
You want to fuck with me?

1950
02:33:54,200 --> 02:33:55,918
You cockroaches.

1951
02:33:59,120 --> 02:34:01,759
You want to play games?
Okay, I play with you.

1952
02:34:06,360 --> 02:34:07,918
<i>You wanna play rough?</i>

1953
02:34:09,360 --> 02:34:11,430
Say hello to my little friend!

1954
02:34:14,640 --> 02:34:16,153
<i>You want to play rough?</i>

1955
02:34:17,280 --> 02:34:19,999
<i>There! You like that?</i>

1956
02:34:21,800 --> 02:34:23,028
You want more?

1957
02:34:29,840 --> 02:34:30,989
<i>You whores!</i>

1958
02:34:32,360 --> 02:34:33,429
Cowards!

1959
02:35:19,120 --> 02:35:20,553
Want to fuck with me?

1960
02:35:36,720 --> 02:35:38,392
<i>Go ahead!</i>

1961
02:35:39,800 --> 02:35:40,789
<i>Come on!</i>

1962
02:35:43,400 --> 02:35:45,470
How do you like that?

1963
02:35:46,240 --> 02:35:48,117
<i>You fucking maricón!</i>

1964
02:35:50,440 --> 02:35:52,078
You think you can take me?

1965
02:35:52,160 --> 02:35:54,310
<i>You need a fucking army
if you gonna take me!</i>

1966
02:35:54,400 --> 02:35:58,552
You hear? Come on!
I take you all to fucking hell!

1967
02:36:04,160 --> 02:36:07,232
Who you think you fucking with?
I'm Tony Montana!

1968
02:36:08,120 --> 02:36:10,588
You fuck with me,
you fucking with the best!

1969
02:36:14,640 --> 02:36:16,153
I'm still standing.

1970
02:36:20,280 --> 02:36:22,669
Come on! I take your fucking bullet!

1971
02:36:24,200 --> 02:36:26,031
Come on! I take your fucking bullet!

1972
02:36:26,120 --> 02:36:27,792
You think you kill me with bullets?

1973
02:36:27,880 --> 02:36:30,440
I take your fucking bullets!
Go ahead!

1974
02:37:29,200 --> 02:37:34,194
