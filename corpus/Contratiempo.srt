00:00:44,326 --> 00:00:46,826
<i>The Invisible Guest</i>

2
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,600
Mr. Doria?
Virginia Goodman.

3
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:56,759
I came on behalf of your
lawyer, Felix Leiva.

4
00:02:58,282 --> 00:02:59,482
Nice to meet you.

5
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,550
- Please come in.
- Thank you.

6
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:08,130
- Two minutes and I'll finish dressing.
- Sure.

7
00:03:09,699 --> 00:03:13,413
<i>Information provided

00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,900
<i>Here, the news of the
day and this morning</i>

10
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,483
<i>they held the
funeral of Laura Vidal,</i>

11
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:27,108
<i>known photographer

<i>allegedly killed by her

00:03:30,416 --> 00:03:33,067

<i>as entrepreneur of the year'.</i>

16
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:40,203
<i>Doria, who had recently
launched in the Asian market,</i>

17
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:42,483
<i>his company 'Go Global Tech Media',</i>

18
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:46,433
<i>pleads innocence and claims to
be the victim of a conspiracy.</i>

19
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:49,317
I expected you later, Ms. Goodman.

20
00:03:49,417 --> 00:03:51,795
Yes, I'm afraid there's been
a mishap.

21
00:03:51,895 --> 00:03:54,298
I tried to talk to Felix,
but he's not responding.

22
00:03:54,398 --> 00:03:55,598
He's traveling.

23
00:03:56,077 --> 00:03:59,736
But he assured me he had everything
under control, he had a lead...

24
00:03:59,836 --> 00:04:01,527
- that would change everything.
- Yes.

25
00:04:01,627 --> 00:04:03,733
This he told me the last
time I talked to him.

26
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:05,989
But then I didn't know
what I know now

27
00:04:06,089 --> 00:04:08,116
- and that he doesn't know yet.
- Meaning?

28
00:04:08,216 --> 00:04:10,908
It's quite possible that you'll
be compelled to testify tonight.

29
00:04:11,008 --> 00:04:12,768
- What are you saying?
- My contacts in court

30
00:04:12,831 --> 00:04:15,544
assure me that the prosecution
has a brand new witness,

31
00:04:15,644 --> 00:04:18,153
that could provide a definitive
turning point in your case.

32
00:04:18,253 --> 00:04:21,692
No word yet on who he is, but they
are transferring him to the courts,

33
00:04:21,792 --> 00:04:23,942
to give a deposition within
the next three hours.

34
00:04:24,345 --> 00:04:25,753
I told the truth.

35
00:04:25,853 --> 00:04:28,365
There are gaps in your statement, Mr.
Doria

36
00:04:28,465 --> 00:04:30,065
and I need details.

37
00:04:31,335 --> 00:04:33,785
The reliability of your testimony
is based on the details.

38
00:04:34,015 --> 00:04:37,400
With them, I can convince the
world that you're innocent.

39
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,650
And I assure you that I can.

40
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:43,275
So far, I have never lost
a case, in any process.

41
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:46,233
But I need you to cooperate.

42
00:04:46,877 --> 00:04:50,677
The police has turned this place in a cell.
They watch me 24 hours a day.

43
00:04:51,396 --> 00:04:54,317
Don't you think that if I had more to say,
I would have told you already?

44
00:04:54,417 --> 00:04:57,748
They will request your immediate
incarceration, Mr. Doria.

45
00:04:57,848 --> 00:05:00,567
We have 180 minutes to review
everything from the beginning.

46
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:04,267
So I would stop complaining
and get down to business.

47
00:05:14,448 --> 00:05:15,198
Good.

48
00:05:15,459 --> 00:05:17,109
First things first.

49
00:05:17,504 --> 00:05:20,304
What were you and the victim
doing in that hotel?

50
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,190
<i>They arranged for a meeting there.</i>

51
00:05:34,504 --> 00:05:37,254
<i>Laura and I had been seeing
each other for a few months.</i>

52
00:05:38,167 --> 00:05:40,417
<i>Someone who found out was
blackmailing us.</i>

53
00:05:41,367 --> 00:05:43,267
<i>We followed his instructions.</i>

54
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,150
He asked for 100,000 euros.

55
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:49,300
It's better to pay for the silence
of someone facing a millionaire divorce.

56
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,000
No, I never wanted to divorce Sonia.
I love her.

57
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:55,567
Why that hotel, three hundred
kilometers from your lives?

58
00:05:55,723 --> 00:05:56,723
I don't know.

59
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:59,781
Weren't you suspicious that the appointment
was arranged in such an isolated place?

60
00:05:59,806 --> 00:06:03,184
- What does it matter whether it's one hotel or another?
- Had you and your lover been there before?

61
00:06:03,209 --> 00:06:07,059
The problem is that I have been
accused of murder, Mrs. Goodman.

62
00:06:07,187 --> 00:06:09,437
Everything's important, Mr. Doria.

63
00:06:10,841 --> 00:06:12,041
Anyway, it's all right.

64
00:06:13,184 --> 00:06:16,834
First, let's talk about the message
you received on your cell phone.

65
00:06:19,793 --> 00:06:22,943
<i>We had been waiting for a couple
of hours when it arrived.</i>

66
00:06:41,712 --> 00:06:42,662
What's up?

67
00:06:48,212 --> 00:06:49,712
He has your mobile.

68
00:06:50,167 --> 00:06:53,317
He just sent a message
from your cell.

69
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:56,233
<i>I'll tell you everything. Room 715.
Hotel Bellavista.</i>

70
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,300
It's a trap.

71
00:06:59,177 --> 00:07:00,377
We're leaving.

72
00:07:27,335 --> 00:07:28,185
Adrian?

73
00:07:32,196 --> 00:07:34,696
I was unconscious for a few minutes...

74
00:07:35,773 --> 00:07:38,778
<i>and when I woke up, the nightmare
started.</i>

75
00:07:43,097 --> 00:07:44,947
<i>What's the first thing
you remember?</i>

76
00:07:45,667 --> 00:07:47,117
<i>The knocks on the door.</i>

77
00:07:48,698 --> 00:07:49,598
Police!

78
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:53,000
Are you OK?

79
00:08:18,048 --> 00:08:18,948
Police!

80
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:21,399
Open the door.

81
00:08:31,634 --> 00:08:32,784
Move away.

82
00:08:33,924 --> 00:08:34,974
Laura! Hey!

83
00:08:40,004 --> 00:08:42,454
- Can you hear me? Laura?
- Open, please!

84
00:08:43,092 --> 00:08:45,792
- Laura!
- Anyone there, open the door!

85
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:47,431
No... no!

86
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:50,361
Laura! Help!

87
00:08:51,403 --> 00:08:52,820
Help please!

88
00:08:53,007 --> 00:08:53,907
Police!

89
00:08:55,278 --> 00:08:56,241
Help!

90
00:08:58,416 --> 00:08:59,316
Stand up!

91
00:09:00,514 --> 00:09:02,614
Hands up! Stand up!

92
00:09:03,736 --> 00:09:06,622
- There's someone else in the room.
- Hands where I can see them!

93
00:09:07,038 --> 00:09:09,520
I didn't do anything, I didn't
do anything!

94
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:10,770
Hands up!

95
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:14,074
- I did nothing.
- Get down!

96
00:09:14,174 --> 00:09:18,042
- There was... there was someone here!
- Get down! Don't resist!

97
00:09:18,616 --> 00:09:19,716
All out!

98
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:44,420
According to the police report

99
00:09:44,582 --> 00:09:47,151
Witnesses heard the cries,
but they saw no one

100
00:09:47,251 --> 00:09:49,101
leave the room

101
00:09:50,741 --> 00:09:54,591
which it was also locked from the
inside with the safety chain.

102
00:09:55,484 --> 00:09:59,130
The report also indicate that the windows
did not open from the inside,

103
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:02,650
because, in the winter months,
the hotel takes the handles off,

104
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:05,200
and that it had not been forced.

105
00:10:05,954 --> 00:10:09,055
They ascertained that any way out
without being seen,

106
00:10:09,155 --> 00:10:12,755
was not possible without
leaving traces.

107
00:10:13,042 --> 00:10:14,842
They found none.

108
00:10:15,918 --> 00:10:19,418
So, according to your version of the
facts, the murderer of your mistress

109
00:10:19,989 --> 00:10:21,692
- vanished into thin air.
- That's it.

110
00:10:21,792 --> 00:10:24,558
- He had to enter first before leaving.
- He was already inside when we arrived.

111
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:26,833
But he had to get in regardless.

112
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:31,200
And according to the staff, he could
not enter except with a key like yours.

113
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:34,275
The whole crime scene was set up
to incriminate me and that

114
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:38,025
<i>the police would have formulated the false
theory that Laura fell in love with me</i>

115
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:42,613
<i>and I, to save my marriage, tried unsuccessfully
to buy her off, and then killed her.</i>

116
00:10:44,855 --> 00:10:47,240
<i>- It's an absurd trap.
- Whose?</i>

117
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:48,290
<i>I don't know.</i>

118
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:50,506
- Why?
- I tell you I don't know!

119
00:10:50,606 --> 00:10:53,446
The only thing I know is that my wife
has left me and took my daughter with her.

120
00:10:53,471 --> 00:10:55,190
<i>And that someone is
getting away with it.</i>

121
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:57,218
<i>If you don't pay attention,</i>

122
00:10:57,529 --> 00:11:00,534
<i>if you don't seek answers
in your life, you know what will happen?</i>

123
00:11:00,634 --> 00:11:02,756
<i>- What?
- You'll be confirming the police suspicions.</i>

124
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:07,146
<i>They believe there's no one who would
have any reason to do this to you.</i>

125
00:11:07,605 --> 00:11:09,355
So your version

126
00:11:09,537 --> 00:11:12,961
- sounds like 'invention', Mr. Doria.
- It's not my responsibility to find the guilty!

127
00:11:13,061 --> 00:11:14,750
- No.
- It's Felix's and yours.

128
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:18,106
And, of course, the police, who
must catch the culprit. Not me.

129
00:11:18,206 --> 00:11:20,085
You... are the guilty.

130
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:26,062
Mr. Doria, if you were in my place,

131
00:11:26,912 --> 00:11:29,983
and I describe your theory
of the plot to you, what would you think?

132
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:33,525
I'm describing what happened.
I don't know what else is expected of me.

133
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:34,425
You know?

134
00:11:37,542 --> 00:11:41,492
In the 30 years of my career, I have had to
deal with two types of clients.

135
00:11:42,154 --> 00:11:44,525
Those who take responsibility
and cooperate,

136
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:47,069
although it would mean to go where
they don't want to,

137
00:11:47,169 --> 00:11:49,340
and those who think are smarter
than me and expect

138
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,640
that I save them from a guilty sentence,
without getting their hands dirty.

139
00:11:53,055 --> 00:11:54,855
You belong to the latter.

140
00:11:55,388 --> 00:11:58,288
But let me be clear about two
things.

141
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:08,070
There'll be no salvation
without suffering

142
00:12:08,705 --> 00:12:10,605
and you're not smarter than me.

143
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:21,295
<i>Youth Missing in Bierge</i>

144
00:12:23,857 --> 00:12:27,457
Have you wondered if the new prosecution
witness had anything to do with this?

145
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:31,059
<i>The disappearance of Daniel Garrido -
Shy and responsible young man</i>

146
00:12:31,991 --> 00:12:34,691
We have already lost 10 minutes, Mr.
Doria.

147
00:12:35,417 --> 00:12:37,567
I'll ask you just once.

148
00:12:40,098 --> 00:12:43,249
Do you know who was the man
in that hotel room?

149
00:12:49,871 --> 00:12:51,471
If you want to know, if you want me

150
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:53,934
to get you out of the mess you are in

151
00:12:54,034 --> 00:12:55,612
and avoid jail time,

152
00:12:56,459 --> 00:12:57,859
don't lie to me anymore.

153
00:13:14,133 --> 00:13:16,033
<i>It all started about three months ago.</i>

154
00:13:24,909 --> 00:13:26,631
- Darling.
- How's Paris?

155
00:13:28,903 --> 00:13:31,984
- Full of nasty French.
- The meeting didn't go well?

156
00:13:32,084 --> 00:13:34,306
- I don't think we'll close.
- <i>My father called.</i>

157
00:13:34,406 --> 00:13:36,025
He's invited us to go sailing on Sunday.

158
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:39,003
I told him we're going.
He's dying to see Alex.

159
00:13:39,103 --> 00:13:40,603
<i>- All right.</i>
- It's dad!

160
00:13:40,976 --> 00:13:42,276
Let's see, say dad.

161
00:13:42,635 --> 00:13:43,435
Dad!

162
00:13:44,081 --> 00:13:46,471
Listen, Sonia I have to
get to the airport.

163
00:13:46,571 --> 00:13:49,387
<i>OK. Are you coming home or
are you staying in Barcelona?</i>

164
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:55,933
I'm coming home.

165
00:13:56,224 --> 00:13:57,824
Let me know when you're boarding.

166
00:13:58,230 --> 00:13:59,080
I love you.

167
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:00,233
Me too.

168
00:14:08,854 --> 00:14:09,754
Who was it?

169
00:14:10,031 --> 00:14:11,031
It was Sonia.

170
00:14:11,709 --> 00:14:12,858
What time is it?

171
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:15,699
It's almost six.
We fell asleep.

172
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:25,320
<i>Dad.</i>

173
00:14:29,903 --> 00:14:30,870
<i>Dad.</i>

174
00:14:33,546 --> 00:14:34,446
Shall we?

175
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:17,313
- The GPS did not say that.
- Yeah, but through here it's quicker.

176
00:15:17,721 --> 00:15:19,571
You could also go faster, right?

177
00:15:21,573 --> 00:15:23,293
- Should I drive?
- You are already driving.

178
00:15:27,878 --> 00:15:28,828
What's up'?

179
00:15:30,667 --> 00:15:32,517
I spend the days lying.

180
00:15:35,804 --> 00:15:38,154
I don't think that when you're with me
you do.

181
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:43,670
The rest of the day I lie
'cause I'm with you.

182
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:46,566
But being with me makes you happy.

183
00:15:47,212 --> 00:15:47,940
Doesn't it?

184
00:15:49,704 --> 00:15:53,254
I love how I feel when we're together.

185
00:15:54,565 --> 00:15:57,442
Remember what we said when
we first got together?

186
00:15:57,652 --> 00:15:59,852
That's what both wanted.

187
00:16:02,568 --> 00:16:06,309
- And when also said that the time would come...
- Adrian, you want to leave Sonia?

188
00:16:06,409 --> 00:16:08,159
- No.
- I don't want to leave Bruno either.

189
00:16:08,411 --> 00:16:10,561
That's why this is perfect for us.

190
00:16:12,838 --> 00:16:14,938
Yeah, but you can't have it all.

191
00:16:15,707 --> 00:16:18,057
You always have to
sacrifice something.

192
00:16:20,401 --> 00:16:21,501
We're fine.

193
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:26,152
- Everything is alright!
- No, what we do is wrong.

194
00:16:26,252 --> 00:16:27,102
You know it.

195
00:16:31,837 --> 00:16:32,737
It's done...

196
00:16:37,503 --> 00:16:38,603
I'm sorry.

197
00:16:56,171 --> 00:16:57,171
Are you OK?

198
00:16:59,355 --> 00:17:00,355
I don't know.

199
00:17:32,917 --> 00:17:33,717
Hey...

200
00:17:47,967 --> 00:17:48,967
Are you OK?

201
00:18:08,015 --> 00:18:09,115
Oh, shit...

202
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:17,857
- What are you doing?
- I'm calling the police.

203
00:18:17,882 --> 00:18:20,650
- It's not our fault.
- No, I invaded his lane.

204
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,600
He has the belt, you know?
He was on his cell phone.

205
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:24,608
If you hadn't made me race
I could have reacted.

206
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:26,358
What did you tell me before?

207
00:18:26,611 --> 00:18:29,324
- That you have to sacrifice something, right?
- What are you saying?

208
00:18:29,349 --> 00:18:31,099
That it's him or us, Adrian!

209
00:18:31,537 --> 00:18:33,400
If you call the
police we are lost.

210
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:36,050
Listen, listen!
Listen to me, please.

211
00:18:36,729 --> 00:18:38,429
Nobody saw anything.

212
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:40,318
Nobody knows anything.

213
00:18:40,418 --> 00:18:43,018
Nothing's changed.
Your life, Sonia...

214
00:18:43,688 --> 00:18:44,738
your daughter,

215
00:18:45,862 --> 00:18:47,162
your career.

216
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:51,533
You don't want to lose everything, right?

217
00:18:53,797 --> 00:18:54,547
True?

218
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:05,350
Let's go.

219
00:19:21,667 --> 00:19:22,667
It won't start.

220
00:19:24,035 --> 00:19:26,413
Come on, please, come on, turn over!

221
00:19:26,513 --> 00:19:29,313
- Adrian...
- Why, no fucking way! Let's go.

222
00:19:30,915 --> 00:19:31,765
Watch out.

223
00:19:32,246 --> 00:19:34,296
- What's up'?
- Someone's coming.

224
00:19:41,499 --> 00:19:43,099
Get out of the car.

225
00:19:51,598 --> 00:19:53,016
- What do we do?
- Let me handle it.

226
00:19:53,116 --> 00:19:55,136
- Let me.
- Where are you going? Hey!

227
00:20:12,016 --> 00:20:12,916
He'll figure it out.

228
00:20:13,756 --> 00:20:15,456
Can you tell me what you are doing?

229
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:17,490
We bumped...

230
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:20,310
- How did we...
- rules of the game.

231
00:20:25,426 --> 00:20:26,226
Hello.

232
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,200
You need help?
What happened to you?

233
00:20:32,335 --> 00:20:36,085
Nothing, I swerved and I hit him,
but we are exchanging information.

234
00:20:36,329 --> 00:20:38,879
- You want me call an ambulance or something?
- No, no.

235
00:20:39,368 --> 00:20:41,618
Really.
We're fine, thanks.

236
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:45,020
Sure?

237
00:21:00,882 --> 00:21:03,832
Must be the guys from the insurance.
Be right back, OK?

238
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:09,660
Hey.

239
00:21:11,037 --> 00:21:12,337
Pretty scary, right?

240
00:21:12,815 --> 00:21:16,465
A deer crossed the road.
I'm still a bit shaken up.

241
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:21,675
Yes'...

242
00:21:22,313 --> 00:21:24,453
Yes, I called earlier.

243
00:21:24,553 --> 00:21:26,303
- Sure?
- Yes, thank you.

244
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,390
How long do you think they'll take?

245
00:21:42,113 --> 00:21:43,513
OK, goodbye.

246
00:21:46,317 --> 00:21:47,617
It's all settled.

247
00:21:47,917 --> 00:21:50,192
I'm glad it was nothing.

248
00:21:50,292 --> 00:21:51,142
Thank you.

249
00:21:51,709 --> 00:21:53,709
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

250
00:21:57,295 --> 00:21:58,841
- What if he saw anything?
- He hasn't seen anything.

251
00:21:58,866 --> 00:22:01,150
- And if he saw the guy?
- We have to get rid of it.

252
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:03,775
- Are you crazy?
- There's a witness, don't you see?

253
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:06,775
If we leave him here, the guy
will know we lied.

254
00:22:07,608 --> 00:22:08,658
Please!

255
00:22:23,156 --> 00:22:26,006
It's best if I stay here to ask
for help.

256
00:22:26,582 --> 00:22:27,354
All right?

257
00:22:27,454 --> 00:22:29,404
And you take care of the body.

258
00:22:30,653 --> 00:22:31,853
What do I do with it?

259
00:22:32,922 --> 00:22:33,922
I don't know.

260
00:22:34,526 --> 00:22:37,626
I don't know, but we have to get
rid of everything, all right?

261
00:22:39,292 --> 00:22:42,292
And then, if it's what you want,
we stop seeing each other.

262
00:22:44,191 --> 00:22:45,191
It's over.

263
00:23:07,376 --> 00:23:09,076
<i>I drove for almost an hour.</i>

264
00:23:10,542 --> 00:23:14,792
<i>And the only thing I could think of is why I
was there instead of being with my family.</i>

265
00:23:17,678 --> 00:23:19,628
If I hadn't been with Laura...

266
00:23:20,053 --> 00:23:23,953
if we had not fallen asleep, if
we hadn't taken the other road...

267
00:23:27,245 --> 00:23:30,395
that deer would never have
crossed my path.

268
00:23:31,209 --> 00:23:31,909
Never.

269
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:39,083
What did you do with the car?

270
00:23:42,875 --> 00:23:44,025
I sank it.

271
00:23:46,949 --> 00:23:48,299
With the guy in it?

272
00:26:15,417 --> 00:26:18,167
Laura's words kept resonating in
my head.

273
00:26:22,224 --> 00:26:26,074
It had been an accident and we
couldn't help the lad.

274
00:26:26,774 --> 00:26:29,024
He had no future, but we did.

275
00:26:29,472 --> 00:26:30,422
We did.

276
00:26:38,706 --> 00:26:41,461
That guy was like
one of these spots.

277
00:26:43,273 --> 00:26:46,373
I had to learn to see it like that
so I wouldn't go crazy.

278
00:26:51,002 --> 00:26:52,202
What did you do after?

279
00:26:54,637 --> 00:26:57,687
I called Laura with a prepaid phone
and told her where I was.

280
00:26:58,185 --> 00:27:01,185
We always used prepaid to
communicate with each other.

281
00:27:14,101 --> 00:27:15,551
It was horrible.

282
00:27:17,167 --> 00:27:18,467
What happened?

283
00:27:19,034 --> 00:27:20,620
Hello, I have car problems.

284
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,620
No, I'm fine, but I
need a tow truck.

285
00:27:23,916 --> 00:27:24,616
Yes.

286
00:27:25,432 --> 00:27:26,632
Where I am?

287
00:27:31,331 --> 00:27:32,340
<i>Call</i>

288
00:28:19,271 --> 00:28:21,150
- Hello.
- Good evening, everything OK?

289
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:24,392
Yes, a deer crossed my path,
but I'm fine, thank you.

290
00:28:24,492 --> 00:28:26,946
You were lucky, you might
have killed yourself.

291
00:28:27,046 --> 00:28:28,296
No power.

292
00:28:28,558 --> 00:28:31,367
The engine, I do not know, it doesn't
start and I called for roadside assistance,

293
00:28:31,392 --> 00:28:33,433
but they're very busy and they don't
know how long it will take them.

294
00:28:33,458 --> 00:28:35,114
There's always a solution.

295
00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:37,805
I know these cars really well, these
machines, are good.

296
00:28:37,905 --> 00:28:39,255
Coincidentally...

297
00:28:39,432 --> 00:28:41,808
years ago, I worked as an engineer in
their Spanish headquarters.

298
00:28:41,833 --> 00:28:44,133
Tomas Garrido.
Now, I have a repair shop.

299
00:28:45,062 --> 00:28:46,262
Nice to meet you.

300
00:28:47,556 --> 00:28:50,156
- I have to get to Barcelona.
- Do you have a flashlight?

301
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,390
The car is my sister's. She lent
it to me, and I'm not sure where...

302
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:02,200
Don't worry...

303
00:29:02,583 --> 00:29:03,783
I'll get mine.

304
00:29:17,583 --> 00:29:19,277
Yeah, it's the starter.

305
00:29:22,141 --> 00:29:25,942
Probably, the motor sensor
is blocked.

306
00:29:26,042 --> 00:29:27,892
If there's nothing else,

307
00:29:28,302 --> 00:29:31,702
only that it needs the unit
to be reset.

308
00:29:32,305 --> 00:29:34,005
It looks like the rest is okay.

309
00:29:34,533 --> 00:29:38,456
If you wish, I can tow it
to my house, and I'll fix it there.

310
00:29:41,605 --> 00:29:45,655
If you prefer I can call a truck
and tell them where they can find you.

311
00:29:45,814 --> 00:29:47,147
How long would it take?

312
00:29:47,247 --> 00:29:50,497
- The tow truck?
- No, you fixing the engine.

313
00:29:50,972 --> 00:29:52,772
A couple of hours, at most.

314
00:29:53,244 --> 00:29:54,244
OK.

315
00:30:00,043 --> 00:30:01,793
So, you live in Barcelona.

316
00:30:03,533 --> 00:30:04,933
And what brings you here?

317
00:30:05,575 --> 00:30:07,525
My sister lives in Barbastro.

318
00:30:08,836 --> 00:30:12,525
My wife worked there, in the
the natural park reserve.

319
00:30:12,784 --> 00:30:16,534
Now, she works near Bierge, in the
valley, 20 minutes from home.

320
00:30:19,417 --> 00:30:22,775
First, she was a teacher of
Literature, but she had to abandon.

321
00:30:22,875 --> 00:30:23,875
Cancer.

322
00:30:25,708 --> 00:30:29,708
That's why we came to live here.
To have a quieter life.

323
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,050
What do you do?

324
00:30:40,248 --> 00:30:41,548
I have a book shop.

325
00:30:42,893 --> 00:30:43,993
I love reading.

326
00:30:45,784 --> 00:30:47,284
Especially about theater.

327
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,500
My weakness are the classics.

328
00:30:49,785 --> 00:30:51,567
My wife made me discover them.

329
00:30:51,667 --> 00:30:54,817
That's how we met. In a theater group.

330
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:58,010
She got along very well, but
to be honest

331
00:30:58,110 --> 00:31:00,310
I just signed up to go along.

332
00:31:03,334 --> 00:31:05,784
You haven't told me your name yet.

333
00:31:06,928 --> 00:31:08,428
- Raquel.
- Raquel.

334
00:31:10,958 --> 00:31:13,258
Raquel, the cell phone is ringing.

335
00:31:14,955 --> 00:31:16,055
Ah, it's true.

336
00:31:21,548 --> 00:31:23,463
- Hi, darling.
<i>- Hello, Laura.</i>

337
00:31:23,563 --> 00:31:26,067
<i>How 'was the meeting?
When do you board?</i>

338
00:31:26,167 --> 00:31:28,440
Well, I was about to call you.
I'm gonna be late.

339
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:29,190
<i>OK.</i>

340
00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:32,560
Well, look I am bringing home some incident
reports that I can't finish here.

341
00:31:31,344 --> 00:31:32,564
<i>TH - Banking Group</i>

342
00:31:32,664 --> 00:31:34,053
Too many interruptions.

343
00:31:34,153 --> 00:31:36,853
<i>- But what happened? Why the delay?</i>
- Nothing...

344
00:31:37,343 --> 00:31:39,550
A mishap, something wrong with the
engine, I don't know.

345
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:42,192
<i>That's OK, let me know when
you're leaving.</i>

346
00:31:42,292 --> 00:31:44,019
No, no it's not necessary that you
come get me.

347
00:31:44,044 --> 00:31:47,067
No, I'll eat something here and
continue until I'll pick you up.

348
00:31:47,167 --> 00:31:48,858
Please don't come get me, Bruno, please.

349
00:31:48,958 --> 00:31:51,858
- Laura... are you okay?
- <i>I'm sorry, I'm sorry. No, no.</i>

350
00:31:52,101 --> 00:31:55,682
There's nothing, I'm fine now.
I regret not having called you before.

351
00:31:55,782 --> 00:31:58,451
It's OK, don't worry.
I'll see you later at home.

352
00:31:58,551 --> 00:32:00,266
- I love you.
- Me too.

353
00:32:10,707 --> 00:32:11,807
Hello, love.

354
00:32:12,783 --> 00:32:14,983
Elvira, my wife.
She's Raquel.

355
00:32:15,278 --> 00:32:18,684
She hit a deer, and the engine
starter is blocked. I'll fix it for her.

356
00:32:18,784 --> 00:32:20,768
- Nice to meet you.
- Me too.

357
00:32:20,868 --> 00:32:23,168
Are you hurt?
You have blood on your hand.

358
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:27,500
- It probably was the deer's.
- The deer's?

359
00:32:27,683 --> 00:32:29,723
Let me take a look. Some
wounds can become infected.

360
00:32:29,792 --> 00:32:31,192
No, I have no injuries.

361
00:32:32,654 --> 00:32:34,393
Excuse me, but I'm in a big hurry.

362
00:32:34,493 --> 00:32:37,067
Well then, no more talk,
I'll start to work.

363
00:32:37,167 --> 00:32:39,483
- Do you want some coffee?
- Yes, please.

364
00:32:39,583 --> 00:32:41,769
- Come in.
- No, I can wait here. No problem.

365
00:32:41,869 --> 00:32:44,046
You can't stay here, it's very cold.
Come on in.

366
00:32:44,146 --> 00:32:45,896
What's the problem? Get cleaned up.
Come in.

367
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:47,090
Come.

368
00:33:11,341 --> 00:33:12,391
Everything OK?

369
00:33:12,932 --> 00:33:14,358
Yes, yes thank you. It's all right.

370
00:33:14,458 --> 00:33:16,608
I'm gonna take the coffee to Tomas
and be back.

371
00:33:17,042 --> 00:33:18,342
Okay, thanks.

372
00:34:16,857 --> 00:34:20,207
We, too, we had a pair of frights
when we came here.

373
00:34:20,401 --> 00:34:22,201
You sure you don't want to eat
anything?

374
00:34:22,381 --> 00:34:23,881
No, no, no. Thank you.

375
00:34:24,926 --> 00:34:28,276
This is a good place to live but
you need to adapt.

376
00:34:29,875 --> 00:34:30,675
Children?

377
00:34:32,752 --> 00:34:35,805
- Do you have any children? I see that...
- Ah! No, no. No.

378
00:34:37,081 --> 00:34:39,531
My husband would
like to, well, I...

379
00:34:39,868 --> 00:34:42,261
work too much and not...
I don't know very well.

380
00:34:42,361 --> 00:34:44,161
Oh, well, don't be dismayed.

381
00:34:44,495 --> 00:34:47,939
I had Dani, well, Daniel, he does
not like me to call him Dani,

382
00:34:48,039 --> 00:34:50,839
was I was almost 40.
A child changes your life.

383
00:34:53,244 --> 00:34:55,294
But it also gives you everything.
Sorry.

384
00:34:58,157 --> 00:35:01,557
Look, how handsome. He'll be here any
minute now so you'll get to meet him.

385
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:04,580
Clara?

386
00:35:05,191 --> 00:35:06,041
Hi.

387
00:35:07,156 --> 00:35:10,006
No, I'm waiting for him.
We went out with his friends.

388
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:12,200
What?

389
00:35:14,016 --> 00:35:15,166
Are you're with them?

390
00:35:17,694 --> 00:35:19,094
And Daniel is not there?

391
00:35:21,102 --> 00:35:22,252
That's weird...

392
00:35:22,614 --> 00:35:24,164
if he left at 6!

393
00:35:28,298 --> 00:35:28,998
Yes.

394
00:35:29,966 --> 00:35:33,566
He came back from work,
changed and left.

395
00:35:36,205 --> 00:35:36,842
Yes.

396
00:35:36,942 --> 00:35:40,092
Well, that's it. I reset it
and it works perfectly.

397
00:35:40,375 --> 00:35:42,075
Are you staying for dinner?

398
00:35:42,379 --> 00:35:44,251
I'm sure my wife convinced you already.

399
00:35:44,351 --> 00:35:45,251
All right.

400
00:35:45,677 --> 00:35:48,238
No, really, I'm very
late, I'm sorry.

401
00:35:48,338 --> 00:35:51,088
Yes, all right, Clara.
Okay, I'll call you.

402
00:35:54,442 --> 00:35:58,642
Clara says that the boys have not
seen Daniel. They thought he was with her.

403
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,680
What do you mean?

404
00:36:02,567 --> 00:36:05,787
That he should be with his friends, but
no one knows anything about him.

405
00:36:05,887 --> 00:36:07,437
Did you say anything?

406
00:36:07,813 --> 00:36:10,863
Come on, don't get antsy.
Maybe he had other plans.

407
00:36:10,963 --> 00:36:13,998
Sure, Tomas, but he told me
he would be with his friends.

408
00:36:14,098 --> 00:36:16,288
Maybe, he didn't tell you the truth.

409
00:36:16,388 --> 00:36:17,288
Why?

410
00:36:18,346 --> 00:36:20,246
And if he met another girl?

411
00:36:21,051 --> 00:36:22,400
But, no, Tomas. No.

412
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,100
It's all very strange.

413
00:36:24,204 --> 00:36:25,404
I'm going to call him.

414
00:36:30,334 --> 00:36:32,934
Calm down. He's a big boy now.

415
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,240
Do you hear?

416
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:42,700
Yes.

417
00:36:42,891 --> 00:36:43,641
<i>Mom</i>

418
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:46,811
I heard.

419
00:36:52,186 --> 00:36:54,586
- Did you hear a cell phone ringing here?
- No.

420
00:36:55,709 --> 00:36:57,309
I'll call him again.

421
00:36:59,125 --> 00:37:00,175
My son.

422
00:37:00,706 --> 00:37:04,406
He's not with his friends, and my
wife imagines God knows what.

423
00:37:22,561 --> 00:37:23,411
Here it is.

424
00:37:25,167 --> 00:37:26,217
That's weird.

425
00:37:26,977 --> 00:37:29,224
Daniel never goes out
without his mobile phone.

426
00:37:29,324 --> 00:37:31,650
It probably fell off and he didn't
realize it.

427
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:33,450
You tell her, Raquel.

428
00:37:33,872 --> 00:37:36,622
I have to go, really,
I'm very late.

429
00:37:58,746 --> 00:38:00,646
Nobody knows anything about Daniel.

430
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:18,750
What now?

431
00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:23,130
Tell me what we do.

432
00:38:26,958 --> 00:38:29,008
I just thought of something

433
00:38:32,356 --> 00:38:34,056
But I'm in your hands.

434
00:38:39,409 --> 00:38:40,609
It depends on you.

435
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,620
<i>The look in her eyes scared me.</i>

436
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:48,970
<i>Scrap Yard</i>

437
00:38:49,803 --> 00:38:53,153
I made my car disappear
without a trace.

438
00:39:07,997 --> 00:39:09,297
Well, I don't know...

439
00:39:09,661 --> 00:39:12,161
It's located in front
of a scrap yard.

440
00:39:19,768 --> 00:39:23,808
<i>Then I said goodbye to her with the understanding
that it would be the last time we'd see each other.</i>

441
00:39:32,184 --> 00:39:34,424
<i>When I got to town I reported the
car theft to the police,</i>

442
00:39:34,449 --> 00:39:36,999
<i>pretending to be
returning from Paris,</i>

443
00:39:38,949 --> 00:39:40,688
<i>and so I told Sonia.</i>

444
00:39:40,788 --> 00:39:44,116
<i>I told her that I would stop to sleep
in the apartment in the city.</i>

445
00:39:44,216 --> 00:39:45,356
But you're okay?

446
00:39:45,456 --> 00:39:47,256
<i>I did not sleep all night.</i>

447
00:39:47,875 --> 00:39:50,525
<i>But I felt a fraud, an impostor.</i>

448
00:39:51,525 --> 00:39:54,625
<i>One that had taken 10 years
to climb to the top...</i>

449
00:39:55,939 --> 00:39:59,090
<i>but in an instant, I
could lose everything.</i>

450
00:40:01,745 --> 00:40:03,895
<i>The next day, I went to work.</i>

451
00:40:04,792 --> 00:40:08,275
<i>We were preparing the entry of
Go Global Tech Media, Asia,</i>

452
00:40:08,375 --> 00:40:11,175
<i>and it would have looked strange
if I had not shown up.</i>

453
00:40:12,451 --> 00:40:15,601
<i>For more than a year, I had tried
to conclude the agreement.</i>

454
00:40:15,897 --> 00:40:19,297
<i>And now it was going to happen I
could not ruin it.</i>

455
00:40:25,587 --> 00:40:28,067
<i>Before returning home, I
tried to arrange my thoughts,</i>

456
00:40:28,167 --> 00:40:31,317
<i>to present myself in front
of my wife and my daughter.</i>

457
00:40:33,725 --> 00:40:35,207
<i>I had to put a mask,</i>

458
00:40:35,307 --> 00:40:38,951
<i>so that they wouldn't the man I wasn't
but one that should have been.</i>

459
00:40:44,292 --> 00:40:48,194
<i>And when it looked that I had succeeded...
the inevitable happened.</i>

460
00:40:48,389 --> 00:40:51,239
<i>Daniel Garrido, 23, came
out from work in this</i>

461
00:40:51,339 --> 00:40:54,462
<i>bank branch, at around
six in the evening.</i>

462
00:40:54,865 --> 00:40:59,010
<i>So he went home and soon
after came out again.</i>

463
00:40:59,417 --> 00:41:03,058
<i>His parents were waiting for him
at dinner time, but have not received
news of him since then.</i>

464
00:41:03,083 --> 00:41:05,332
<i>Relatives and friends
gathered to search for him.</i>

465
00:41:05,432 --> 00:41:07,604
<i>They believe he probably
was involved in an accident.</i>

466
00:41:07,704 --> 00:41:11,438
<i>His car might be
invisible in a forest ravine.</i>

467
00:41:13,125 --> 00:41:16,225
<i>The face of that father was
imprinted in the retina of my eyes.</i>

468
00:41:16,883 --> 00:41:18,883
I projected his grief.

469
00:41:22,613 --> 00:41:26,813
But I swore that this would be the last
mistake that I would make in my life.

470
00:41:29,353 --> 00:41:30,903
- Excuse me.
- Go ahead.

471
00:41:35,125 --> 00:41:35,925
Tell me.

472
00:41:36,974 --> 00:41:39,652
<i>The prosecution new witness
has arrived in court.</i>

473
00:41:39,752 --> 00:41:40,752
Are you sure?

474
00:41:41,902 --> 00:41:44,552
<i>Not much time left, you
have to make him hurry.</i>

475
00:41:44,726 --> 00:41:46,476
Let me know if there are further news.

476
00:41:52,951 --> 00:41:55,961
The prosecution witness
has arrived at court.

477
00:41:56,061 --> 00:41:59,461
No word yet on who he is, but
the judge is on his way.

478
00:42:02,472 --> 00:42:04,122
I have to talk to Felix.

479
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:09,377
- Tell me.
<i>- Felix, where are you?</i>

480
00:42:09,477 --> 00:42:11,410
I'm coming from Bilbao.

481
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:14,484
<i>Virginia Goodman is here because it seems
that the prosecution has gone ahead of us.</i>

482
00:42:14,509 --> 00:42:15,829
What do you mean the prosecution?

483
00:42:15,917 --> 00:42:18,249
<i>- Look, when do you get back?</i>
- Tonight, on the last flight.

484
00:42:18,274 --> 00:42:19,274
<i>Put her on.</i>

485
00:42:20,136 --> 00:42:21,736
He wants to talk to you.

486
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:26,533
- Felix?
<i>- What's going on?</i>

487
00:42:26,770 --> 00:42:29,567
A new witness.
He just arrived at court.

488
00:42:29,667 --> 00:42:30,567
Virginia?

489
00:42:30,667 --> 00:42:33,775
It's very likely that Mr.
Doria be compelled to testify tonight.

490
00:42:33,875 --> 00:42:36,427
Send me the details in writing,
but I leave it up to you.

491
00:42:36,527 --> 00:42:39,334
<i>I'm on a big break, perhaps
very beneficial for the case.</i>

492
00:42:39,434 --> 00:42:42,984
- <i>I'll call in a couple of hours.</i>
- OK. Thank you, Felix.

493
00:42:55,449 --> 00:42:56,749
What did he say?

494
00:43:00,957 --> 00:43:03,507
Everything's under control.
Don't worry.

495
00:43:03,614 --> 00:43:05,780
Well, let's continue.
Where were we?

496
00:43:07,935 --> 00:43:09,435
I resumed my life.

497
00:43:12,568 --> 00:43:14,168
<i>Then the police arrived.</i>

498
00:43:14,778 --> 00:43:16,678
Mr. Doria, you have visitors.

499
00:43:16,873 --> 00:43:18,073
It's the police.

500
00:43:19,815 --> 00:43:22,565
There's no record of it.
How do you know?

501
00:43:23,667 --> 00:43:25,417
The details, Mr. Doria.

502
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,775
Police in Bierge found the
remains of two collisions,

503
00:43:40,875 --> 00:43:44,256
5 km from where the deceased
lived.

504
00:43:44,797 --> 00:43:48,447
But there's no record of any
party involved in both accidents.

505
00:43:49,299 --> 00:43:52,317
The curious thing is that the
boy's father picked up a woman,

506
00:43:52,417 --> 00:43:55,017
who had had an accident right here,

507
00:43:55,205 --> 00:43:58,155
the same day his son disappeared.

508
00:44:06,491 --> 00:44:07,541
You know her?

509
00:44:22,039 --> 00:44:24,039
- What is this?
- Let's see...

510
00:44:24,139 --> 00:44:28,189
Why would my client care what happened
in Bierge, when he was in Paris?

511
00:44:28,333 --> 00:44:30,959
This woman said to the
father of the missing boy

512
00:44:31,059 --> 00:44:32,619
that she hit a deer.

513
00:44:33,416 --> 00:44:36,459
But the remains of a second
vehicle on the road

514
00:44:36,824 --> 00:44:38,574
force us to hypothesize

515
00:44:38,674 --> 00:44:42,520
something has happened that was
concealed with the help of a companion.

516
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:43,220
So?

517
00:44:43,578 --> 00:44:46,278
The license plate of the car
driven by this woman

518
00:44:46,577 --> 00:44:49,650
belongs to a BMW which is
registered to your client.

519
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:53,550
And that was stolen from a
private parking that weekend.

520
00:44:53,659 --> 00:44:56,838
Are you insinuating that Mr. Doria
is trying to hide an accident

521
00:44:56,938 --> 00:44:58,438
for which there's no evidence?

522
00:44:58,708 --> 00:45:00,794
According to the complaint,
you could not provide

523
00:45:00,894 --> 00:45:03,915
a parking ticket that would prove
that the car was where you said it was.

524
00:45:04,015 --> 00:45:05,065
I lost it.

525
00:45:05,708 --> 00:45:08,757
It was in my wallet, which I left in
my jacket. I lost it during my journey.

526
00:45:08,857 --> 00:45:12,150
Yes, I know. So you said at the police
station. Very convenient, isn't it?

527
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:13,239
One moment.

528
00:45:13,339 --> 00:45:17,089
The license plate information was
given by the father of the deceased?

529
00:45:18,458 --> 00:45:20,519
That's very convenient.

530
00:45:20,619 --> 00:45:24,723
- And an unverified clue.
- That's we want... verify!

531
00:45:24,823 --> 00:45:28,763
It wasn't necessary to disturb my
client to check his trip to Paris.

532
00:45:28,863 --> 00:45:31,663
It was sufficient to ask his secretary
for the details.

533
00:45:32,751 --> 00:45:34,001
Are we finished?

534
00:45:40,125 --> 00:45:41,925
Why are you so nervous?

535
00:45:45,558 --> 00:45:47,658
Tell me, or I won't be able to help.

536
00:45:48,375 --> 00:45:51,975
Does the disappearance of this boy has
anything to do with you?

537
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:53,308
Then?

538
00:45:59,273 --> 00:46:00,973
I was not in Paris.

539
00:46:03,739 --> 00:46:05,489
I was with a woman.

540
00:46:06,761 --> 00:46:10,661
So Eva can't prove to the
police that you were in Paris.

541
00:46:11,597 --> 00:46:14,650
Can you make them believe I was there?
Can you buy me an alibi?

542
00:46:14,750 --> 00:46:18,000
- Do I have any alternative?
- I left her. It was a mistake.

543
00:46:18,801 --> 00:46:20,949
I can not allow this bloody coincidence

544
00:46:21,049 --> 00:46:23,949
to ruin my life with Alex and Sonia.
I can't.

545
00:46:24,542 --> 00:46:28,141
The next time you call me, start
by telling me everything.

546
00:46:33,404 --> 00:46:35,054
I'm gonna need something else.

547
00:46:38,218 --> 00:46:39,168
What?

548
00:46:40,162 --> 00:46:43,512
The police report.
I don't want this to haunt me.

549
00:46:45,145 --> 00:46:46,445
I will take care of it.

550
00:46:47,437 --> 00:46:50,975
<i>Days later, the police confirmed that I had
been to Paris and they forgot the whole affair.</i>

551
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,700
Felix satisfied the first part of
the agreement, but not the second.

552
00:46:55,397 --> 00:46:59,247
One of my source managed to find
your name in the police archives.

553
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:02,633
And I'm afraid the prosecution
has also obtained it.

554
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:10,150
I would not have come this far were
it not for Laura.

555
00:47:10,250 --> 00:47:13,807
What did you do when the police
reached out to you to identify her?

556
00:47:13,907 --> 00:47:15,357
I did not tell her.

557
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:18,625
I know you contacted her.

558
00:47:19,186 --> 00:47:22,045
Rich people don't want to stop being
rich and protect themselves

559
00:47:22,145 --> 00:47:23,442
<i>Protect what they have.</i>

560
00:47:23,542 --> 00:47:28,343
<i>Go where the rich are... and
you will find security cameras everywhere.</i>

561
00:47:28,443 --> 00:47:31,775
How did you convince the
police that Daniel Garrido ran away?

562
00:47:31,875 --> 00:47:33,125
Where are you calling from?

563
00:47:34,167 --> 00:47:35,442
The phone booth at the port.

564
00:47:35,542 --> 00:47:38,542
Speaking in a place so well protected is
not a very prudent move, Mr. Doria.

565
00:47:38,595 --> 00:47:40,495
My nerves betrayed me, I know.

566
00:47:42,953 --> 00:47:45,526
But, come on, don't think me so stupid
to contact Laura

567
00:47:45,626 --> 00:47:48,763
just after police try to
involve me with her.

568
00:47:48,863 --> 00:47:50,613
Then, when and why?

569
00:47:53,393 --> 00:47:55,643
When I didn't know what else to do.

570
00:47:58,347 --> 00:48:01,397
<i>Laura would not stop when
she had what she wanted.</i>

571
00:48:04,016 --> 00:48:06,416
<i>She did it with me
when we first met.</i>

572
00:48:08,110 --> 00:48:11,610
<i>She was doing it again to forget
everything that had happened.</i>

573
00:48:12,042 --> 00:48:14,843
<i>and the police have ruled out
that Daniel Garrido,</i>

574
00:48:14,943 --> 00:48:17,943
<i>the boy from Bierge, who
disappeared three weeks ago,</i>

575
00:48:18,257 --> 00:48:21,457
<i>had an accident.
According to latest research,</i>

576
00:48:21,625 --> 00:48:24,834
<i>Garrido may have pretended
to have disappeared,</i>

577
00:48:25,197 --> 00:48:26,275
<i>to run away.</i>

578
00:48:26,375 --> 00:48:28,543
<i>Police sources reported</i>

579
00:48:28,643 --> 00:48:32,663
<i>the boy took possession of
50,000 euros of the bank branch,</i>

580
00:48:32,763 --> 00:48:33,858
<i>where he worked.</i>

581
00:48:33,958 --> 00:48:37,775
<i>Daniel Garrido took away small quantities'
from the accounts of its customers...</i>

582
00:48:37,875 --> 00:48:39,625
Ready to set sail, dear?

583
00:48:41,365 --> 00:48:44,358
I just learned that I have
an urgent meeting with Lee.

584
00:48:44,458 --> 00:48:46,708
- Where are you calling from?
- From a booth.

585
00:48:49,378 --> 00:48:52,828
We'll meet in four hours in the
bar in front of the junk yard.

586
00:49:04,311 --> 00:49:05,611
What is this'?

587
00:49:07,116 --> 00:49:08,966
The boy's wallet.

588
00:49:10,510 --> 00:49:13,160
I took it before putting
him in the trunk.

589
00:49:15,708 --> 00:49:18,908
I thought it could be
useful and so it has.

590
00:49:20,403 --> 00:49:23,903
After the accident, Bruno worked
at home for a few days.

591
00:49:24,875 --> 00:49:28,875
I took the opportunity to put an end
to all this, in the only way possible.

592
00:50:27,919 --> 00:50:30,819
<i>Successfully completed
Money Transfer</i>

593
00:50:32,208 --> 00:50:33,658
<i>What are you telling me?</i>

594
00:50:33,886 --> 00:50:36,596
<i>Your mistress was an expert
in banking IT system,</i>

595
00:50:36,696 --> 00:50:38,196
<i>as well as a photographer?</i>

596
00:50:38,408 --> 00:50:40,292
Do you think that the
jurors are stupid?

597
00:50:40,392 --> 00:50:42,267
She met her husband while working
as a clerk at the bank.

598
00:50:42,292 --> 00:50:46,709
Information technology is making headway by giant
leaps, you should know this better than anyone.

599
00:50:46,958 --> 00:50:49,650
Your mistress was keeping up,
while she was a photographer?

600
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:51,700
Perhaps she was helped by her husband.

601
00:50:51,998 --> 00:50:56,148
Maybe she told him the truth but
didn't tell me to keep me out.

602
00:50:56,248 --> 00:50:57,948
You didn't know Laura.

603
00:50:58,837 --> 00:51:00,765
When she wanted something, she
would deceive and persuade.

604
00:51:00,790 --> 00:51:03,240
The perfect prototype
of a <i>femme fatale</i>.

605
00:51:03,625 --> 00:51:05,775
Do you realize what you've done?

606
00:51:06,758 --> 00:51:08,008
What do you think?

607
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:10,973
Don't worry.

608
00:51:11,073 --> 00:51:14,073
If I had left any tracks,
we wouldn't be here.

609
00:51:15,775 --> 00:51:16,525
What?

610
00:51:17,559 --> 00:51:19,759
What? Don't give me that look!

611
00:51:20,291 --> 00:51:22,558
You didn't call the police because
you knew what we were doing was right.

612
00:51:22,583 --> 00:51:24,333
No, we didn't do the right thing.

613
00:51:25,346 --> 00:51:26,196
Adrian.

614
00:51:27,548 --> 00:51:30,466
If I fall, you'll be right behind me.

615
00:51:30,667 --> 00:51:32,517
The police came to see me.

616
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:35,050
Don't threaten me.

617
00:51:36,667 --> 00:51:39,292
And you don't threaten me!

618
00:51:41,165 --> 00:51:44,215
I have pictures that prove that
you had not been to Paris.

619
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:29,240
<i>The days that followed
were not exactly quiet.</i>

620
00:52:29,649 --> 00:52:32,561
<i>My company arrival in Asia, hand
in hand with a technology giant</i>

621
00:52:32,661 --> 00:52:34,261
<i>most 'powerful in the world.</i>

622
00:52:35,037 --> 00:52:38,587
<i>They attributed me with the award
of entrepreneur of the year.</i>

623
00:52:39,042 --> 00:52:41,692
<i>I went head first into the
media hurricane.</i>

624
00:52:46,671 --> 00:52:48,571
Mr. Doria, how do you feel?

625
00:52:50,095 --> 00:52:51,245
Very happy.

626
00:52:51,417 --> 00:52:53,967
<i>They sold me as the 'man
of the moment'.</i>

627
00:52:54,708 --> 00:52:58,508
<i>An example for young people like me who
came from nothing and turned into a winner.</i>

628
00:52:59,458 --> 00:53:01,058
<i>But it was pure appearance.</i>

629
00:53:01,750 --> 00:53:03,750
<i>I felt broken for a long time.</i>

630
00:53:04,288 --> 00:53:05,138
<i>Rotten.</i>

631
00:53:17,405 --> 00:53:18,725
- Mr. Doria.
- Yes?

632
00:53:18,825 --> 00:53:20,942
A reporter wants to talk to you.

633
00:53:21,042 --> 00:53:22,492
He says he knows you.

634
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:23,620
Yes.

635
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,650
If you'll excuse me.
Be careful with that.

636
00:53:29,639 --> 00:53:30,489
See you later.

637
00:53:35,579 --> 00:53:38,029
- To the right, please.
- Yes, thanks.

638
00:53:53,311 --> 00:53:54,461
Mr. Doria.

639
00:53:54,958 --> 00:53:58,158
Sorry to bother you
on such a special day.

640
00:54:00,792 --> 00:54:01,892
You know who I am?

641
00:54:03,196 --> 00:54:04,903
<i>Ivan Souto 'El Periodico'</i>

642
00:54:05,003 --> 00:54:07,003
I just know that you're not Ivan Souto.

643
00:54:15,376 --> 00:54:16,176
Please.

644
00:54:17,739 --> 00:54:19,068
I am Daniel Garrido's father.

645
00:54:19,168 --> 00:54:21,668
I don't know if you saw the news, but...

646
00:54:23,001 --> 00:54:24,481
and they say he fled and, well...

647
00:54:24,581 --> 00:54:27,431
I'd like to ask you
some questions, if I may.

648
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:32,780
All I know of your son is what
the newspapers say.

649
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:35,530
- I'm sorry.
- My son is not a thief.

650
00:54:36,678 --> 00:54:38,878
And he didn't run away.

651
00:54:39,199 --> 00:54:40,699
My son is dead.

652
00:54:41,181 --> 00:54:44,431
Someone is laughing at
my wife and at me.

653
00:54:45,714 --> 00:54:49,664
The day that the police spoke
to you, Elvira and I were there.

654
00:54:52,823 --> 00:54:54,123
<i>I know what I saw.</i>

655
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:56,214
<i>Our son used his cell phone</i>

656
00:54:56,314 --> 00:55:00,314
<i>until shortly before Tomas
picked up that woman on the road.</i>

657
00:55:00,417 --> 00:55:03,560
So, it was impossible that
the phone was at home,

658
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:05,940
unless she brought it with her.

659
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:07,679
This could only have happened

660
00:55:07,779 --> 00:55:10,679
if she crossed paths with
our son at some point.

661
00:55:11,073 --> 00:55:13,692
And then, she was not alone.
There was someone else with her.

662
00:55:13,792 --> 00:55:17,142
- But how can you be so sure?
- I already told you!

663
00:55:17,792 --> 00:55:20,892
<i>She adjusted her seat
before putting it into gear.</i>

664
00:55:21,715 --> 00:55:23,015
<i>She was not driving.</i>

665
00:55:23,659 --> 00:55:24,571
She lied.

666
00:55:24,671 --> 00:55:28,150
The car is my sister's. She lent
to me, and I'm not sure where...

667
00:55:28,250 --> 00:55:31,117
She lied... and nobody lies
without a reason.

668
00:55:33,074 --> 00:55:34,724
She lied to protect herself.

669
00:55:35,792 --> 00:55:37,342
Or to protect you.

670
00:55:38,134 --> 00:55:39,434
Do you have a light?

671
00:55:40,708 --> 00:55:42,908
That woman was hiding something.

672
00:55:55,958 --> 00:55:57,058
And so are you.

673
00:55:59,908 --> 00:56:01,558
Really, I know nothing.

674
00:56:02,606 --> 00:56:04,556
I was in Paris in those days.

675
00:56:05,415 --> 00:56:07,131
<i>That's what the police say.</i>

676
00:56:07,708 --> 00:56:10,963
<i>But, an airline ticket and a
hotel reservation...</i>

677
00:56:11,063 --> 00:56:12,464
<i>they prove nothing</i>

678
00:56:13,170 --> 00:56:17,359
<i>Despite that... we trusted
the police and returned home.</i>

679
00:56:22,507 --> 00:56:24,770
<i>Until a few Dias later,
the news appeared</i>

680
00:56:24,870 --> 00:56:27,570
<i>accusing my son
of being a thief.</i>

681
00:56:34,186 --> 00:56:36,312
<i>We understood that
it was all a hoax.</i>

682
00:56:36,412 --> 00:56:40,162
<i>That was not our Daniel. In his
whole life, he had never hurt anyone.</i>

683
00:56:42,837 --> 00:56:44,387
<i>My wife broke down...</i>

684
00:56:44,750 --> 00:56:47,350
<i>when she understood what
that meant.</i>

685
00:56:50,292 --> 00:56:52,542
<i>But I wasn't going to stop fighting.</i>

686
00:56:54,750 --> 00:56:57,300
<i>I followed the one
track I had left.</i>

687
00:56:58,792 --> 00:56:59,492
<i>You.</i>

688
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,550
<i>And I found out everything that you
might lose by a mishap.</i>

689
00:57:08,015 --> 00:57:11,803
<i>What would it mean to you to
admit that you were not in Paris,</i>

690
00:57:11,903 --> 00:57:13,503
<i>but with another woman instead.</i>

691
00:57:16,062 --> 00:57:19,762
<i>I went back to tell the police, but
they didn't believe me.</i>

692
00:57:20,675 --> 00:57:23,045
<i>That's when I realized
the power you have.</i>

693
00:57:24,488 --> 00:57:27,521
<i>The power that makes a wolf
stronger than it is.</i>

694
00:57:27,621 --> 00:57:30,021
But I'm not afraid of wolves like you.

695
00:57:31,924 --> 00:57:35,317
When you live through the most horrible
experience as a father,

696
00:57:35,417 --> 00:57:36,858
that they take away your son,

697
00:57:36,958 --> 00:57:39,908
that he disappears without
anybody caring,

698
00:57:40,167 --> 00:57:41,917
fear no longer exists.

699
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,650
There's nothing.

700
00:57:47,151 --> 00:57:50,101
Soon they'll find out that I am
an intruder.

701
00:57:51,250 --> 00:57:53,150
So tell me the truth...

702
00:57:54,420 --> 00:57:55,692
where is my son?

703
00:57:58,613 --> 00:58:00,317
I assure you that you are confused.

704
00:58:00,417 --> 00:58:03,675
You were in that car with that
woman whose name is not Raquel.

705
00:58:03,775 --> 00:58:06,825
And you had an accident in
the place where I found her.

706
00:58:06,998 --> 00:58:09,584
And my son's car was also there.

707
00:58:09,684 --> 00:58:11,734
Was it you that got rid of the body?

708
00:58:13,721 --> 00:58:15,271
It was this simple.

709
00:58:32,417 --> 00:58:33,567
Mr. Doria?

710
00:58:34,246 --> 00:58:35,846
Mr. Doria, is that what happened?

711
00:58:36,667 --> 00:58:38,017
From father to father.

712
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:43,270
My wife and I know that
our son is dead.

713
00:58:43,370 --> 00:58:46,215
We only want to find him so we can bury
him and may he rest in peace.

714
00:58:46,315 --> 00:58:47,808
- Sir, you have to come with us.
- Don't touch me.

715
00:58:47,833 --> 00:58:49,775
- Please.
- Don't touch me!

716
00:58:49,951 --> 00:58:53,301
Mr. Doria, I beg you.
Don't touch me, don't touch me!

717
00:58:53,401 --> 00:58:55,901
If your daughter were the one
who had disappeared,

718
00:58:56,255 --> 00:58:59,605
you'd want to ensure that the culprit
wouldn't get away.

719
00:58:59,958 --> 00:59:01,358
Son of a bitch!

720
00:59:05,163 --> 00:59:06,213
Do you know him?

721
00:59:07,167 --> 00:59:08,367
If I know him?

722
00:59:15,060 --> 00:59:16,110
Let's go inside?

723
00:59:24,563 --> 00:59:25,563
Address?

724
00:59:26,001 --> 00:59:29,181
Calle San Ramon... 5, Bierge.

725
00:59:30,584 --> 00:59:32,334
<i>No one connected him to me.</i>

726
00:59:32,697 --> 00:59:34,947
- Phone?
<i>- Not even him.</i>

727
00:59:36,777 --> 00:59:39,477
<i>He knew he'd only
complicate things.</i>

728
00:59:40,484 --> 00:59:43,477
<i>And Felix had already been able
to exclude my name from the case.</i>

729
00:59:43,577 --> 00:59:45,877
- The city, you said?
- Bierge.

730
00:59:57,771 --> 01:00:01,171
<i>He went home barely able
to take care of his wife.</i>

731
01:00:08,234 --> 01:00:10,234
<i>And then, all that disappeared.</i>

732
01:00:11,917 --> 01:00:14,017
And I never heard from him again.

733
01:00:17,417 --> 01:00:18,167
OK.

734
01:00:19,667 --> 01:00:22,617
By now, we have all the pieces
on the board.

735
01:00:23,101 --> 01:00:24,992
<i>Two dead and two bodies.</i>

736
01:00:25,934 --> 01:00:28,775
The murder of your mistress
seems to be a direct consequence

737
01:00:28,875 --> 01:00:30,875
<i>of Daniel Garrido's death.</i>

738
01:00:32,242 --> 01:00:34,621
<i>But, for the police, there
is only one murder</i>

739
01:00:34,721 --> 01:00:36,471
'cause they only have just one body.

740
01:00:36,875 --> 01:00:38,459
Laura Vidal's.

741
01:00:38,559 --> 01:00:40,459
<i>And their suspect is you.</i>

742
01:00:41,071 --> 01:00:42,171
<i>But, for us,</i>

743
01:00:42,660 --> 01:00:44,960
<i>and for Daniel Garrido's parents</i>

744
01:00:45,208 --> 01:00:47,375
there is another body
and another death,

745
01:00:47,475 --> 01:00:49,425
that of the missing boy.

746
01:00:50,167 --> 01:00:53,967
<i>And the Garridos suspect that you
and your lover are the culprits.</i>

747
01:00:54,675 --> 01:00:57,575
Because she's now dead, the
only one that remains...

748
01:00:59,183 --> 01:00:59,883
is you.

749
01:01:02,417 --> 01:01:04,517
What does this puzzle suggests?

750
01:01:06,484 --> 01:01:07,644
What does it suggests to you?

751
01:01:07,869 --> 01:01:10,969
It makes me think of the
hotel room mystery.

752
01:01:11,625 --> 01:01:13,325
In that man who you say...

753
01:01:14,208 --> 01:01:18,343
killed your lover and then
disappeared... like magic.

754
01:01:19,319 --> 01:01:21,669
Someone connected to Daniel Garrido.

755
01:01:24,113 --> 01:01:27,463
There's someone that you have not named
who knows more than those parents.

756
01:01:29,075 --> 01:01:30,325
Do you need help?

757
01:01:30,701 --> 01:01:34,267
Do you want to have the jury believe that
passerby driver arranged the meeting at the hotel?

758
01:01:34,367 --> 01:01:37,885
- To what end, Mr. Doria?
- To blackmail us for what he knew.

759
01:01:37,985 --> 01:01:39,585
That we were guilty.

760
01:01:40,149 --> 01:01:42,645
And that he couldn't find out who I was
and that Laura was not my wife.

761
01:01:42,670 --> 01:01:44,320
Details, Mr. Doria.

762
01:01:44,542 --> 01:01:47,625
I have to warn you that the jury would
only believe this absurd theory,

763
01:01:47,725 --> 01:01:49,715
if the details make it plausible.

764
01:01:49,815 --> 01:01:53,865
I have not yet told you how they arranged
the appointment at the Bellavista Hotel.

765
01:01:54,917 --> 01:01:57,517
Mr. Doria, this has arrived for you.

766
01:02:03,417 --> 01:02:05,117
<i>Sender - Daniel Garrido</i>

767
01:02:14,318 --> 01:02:16,718
<i>I know what you've done
with your girlfriend.</i>

768
01:02:17,208 --> 01:02:20,008
<i>The price for my silence
is 100,000 euros.</i>

769
01:02:20,590 --> 01:02:23,740
<i>In small small, unmarked bills.</i>

770
01:02:23,962 --> 01:02:28,311
<i>If I don't get it today I will get
this photo to the police,</i>

771
01:02:28,708 --> 01:02:30,908
<i>so they can find Daniel Garrido.</i>

772
01:02:36,796 --> 01:02:38,146
<i>At 5 o'clock sharp,</i>

773
01:02:38,767 --> 01:02:42,917
<i>both of you go to the Bierge railway
station.</i>

774
01:02:43,844 --> 01:02:45,094
<i>Be on time.</i>

775
01:02:45,722 --> 01:02:47,817
<i>I'll call the phone booth
in the parking lot</i>

776
01:02:47,917 --> 01:02:50,617
<i>and I'll tell you where
to deliver the money.</i>

777
01:02:50,833 --> 01:02:53,233
<i>Don't come alone, or
without the money.</i>

778
01:02:53,375 --> 01:02:56,622
<i>And don't try anything...
or I will call the police.</i>

779
01:02:58,645 --> 01:03:01,745
The envelope was sent from
Bierge, three days ago.

780
01:03:02,784 --> 01:03:05,284
And the sender is marked
Daniel Garrido.

781
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:10,360
- It was here...
- If it is not, it looks very similar, yes.

782
01:03:13,208 --> 01:03:15,997
Mr. Doria...
did you observe the moon?

783
01:03:20,596 --> 01:03:22,896
Tonight, there's a huge full moon.

784
01:03:25,064 --> 01:03:28,204
As huge as the hole in your story.

785
01:03:28,304 --> 01:03:29,832
How do you know if you don't
let me finish?

786
01:03:29,857 --> 01:03:32,138
How do explain that the passerby driver
would know about the swamp?

787
01:03:32,167 --> 01:03:35,267
The sound I heard
before the car sank.

788
01:03:36,375 --> 01:03:38,675
<i>Tell me, what about if it wasn't
just a deer?</i>

789
01:03:40,122 --> 01:03:42,900
If Laura did not get him to believe
that the incident was between us?

790
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,067
I'm glad it was nothing.

791
01:03:45,167 --> 01:03:46,017
Thank you.

792
01:03:48,014 --> 01:03:50,134
Maybe he saw something
suspicious about our behaviour,

793
01:03:50,173 --> 01:03:52,673
and that he pretended to leave,
and then hide.

794
01:03:52,954 --> 01:03:55,104
Sure, I understand your problem.

795
01:03:55,413 --> 01:03:59,008
You are trying to deflect your story
from Daniel Garrido's death.

796
01:03:59,287 --> 01:04:01,527
- Sorry?
- The passerby driver is one who acts only for the money.

797
01:04:01,667 --> 01:04:04,546
And you think that if you hide
behind that blackmailer,

798
01:04:04,797 --> 01:04:08,079
no one will think about the poor boy,
and you'd look less guilty.

799
01:04:08,179 --> 01:04:10,429
Tell me, do you
have a better idea?

800
01:04:10,854 --> 01:04:12,317
I'll ask you three questions.

801
01:04:12,417 --> 01:04:16,923
If you only responds to just one we will
continue with his absurd theory of yours.

802
01:04:17,907 --> 01:04:18,607
One.

803
01:04:19,022 --> 01:04:22,091
What is the sense of the incriminating
message that you received on your cellphone?

804
01:04:21,596 --> 01:04:23,424
<i>I'll tell you everything. Room 715.
Hotel Bellavista</i>

805
01:04:22,261 --> 01:04:25,939
Two: why did the murderer not take
the money if that was his purpose?

806
01:04:26,039 --> 01:04:30,906
And three: how could he get in and out
of the room as if he were a ghost?

807
01:04:34,107 --> 01:04:34,857
Do you see?

808
01:04:35,250 --> 01:04:37,890
You're giving the
prosecutor exactly what he wants.

809
01:04:37,990 --> 01:04:41,190
Stupid connections that
will destroy the illusion

810
01:04:41,351 --> 01:04:43,400
that you're making a
coherent account...

811
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:44,700
Don't start over with that!

812
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:50,123
Surprise me with something,
resolve this puzzle.

813
01:04:50,223 --> 01:04:53,863
OK, I'll tell what might have
happened, according to what you told me.

814
01:04:53,963 --> 01:04:56,076
- Please.
- Let's go back to the station,

815
01:04:56,176 --> 01:04:59,375
where the blackmailer
had to contact you at 17:00 hours.

816
01:05:04,460 --> 01:05:06,360
It's 5 o' clock. It must be him.

817
01:05:08,013 --> 01:05:10,413
It'd be better if we are not
seen together.

818
01:05:22,912 --> 01:05:23,612
Yes?

819
01:05:23,802 --> 01:05:26,102
<i>I'll be waiting for you
at the Hotel Bellavista.</i>

820
01:05:26,792 --> 01:05:30,842
<i>There is only access by cog train
that goes around the valley.</i>

821
01:05:31,750 --> 01:05:35,835
<i>I booked room 715.</i>

822
01:05:37,819 --> 01:05:40,637
<i>Another thing, leave your
cell phone in the trash,</i>

823
01:05:40,929 --> 01:05:44,878
<i>and take the train at the
station right in front of you.</i>

824
01:05:45,335 --> 01:05:47,565
<i>If you don't drop your
cell phone the police</i>

825
01:05:47,665 --> 01:05:50,015
<i>will find Daniel Garrido's body.</i>

826
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:36,000
I'm going to ask.
Wait here a moment, okay?

827
01:06:42,781 --> 01:06:44,681
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

828
01:06:45,082 --> 01:06:48,389
I have a reservation.
Room 715, please.

829
01:06:50,575 --> 01:06:52,805
Yes. In the name of Adrian Doria?

830
01:06:54,415 --> 01:06:57,915
Please, fill out the card.
I'll give you the key at once.

831
01:07:55,852 --> 01:07:57,402
Did anyone see you?

832
01:07:58,565 --> 01:08:00,215
He left instructions?

833
01:08:01,061 --> 01:08:02,511
We have to wait.

834
01:08:07,721 --> 01:08:08,671
What's up'?

835
01:08:08,958 --> 01:08:11,808
He just sent a text message
from your mobile phone.

836
01:08:13,314 --> 01:08:15,614
- It's a trap.
- We're leaving.

837
01:08:29,041 --> 01:08:29,891
Adrian?

838
01:08:34,081 --> 01:08:35,789
No, no, no!
No, no!

839
01:08:36,028 --> 01:08:36,678
No!

840
01:08:37,792 --> 01:08:40,129
I don't know where.
Really, it wasn't me!

841
01:08:40,229 --> 01:08:42,529
It wasn't me, I don't
know where is'...

842
01:08:53,897 --> 01:08:54,897
A moment.

843
01:08:55,659 --> 01:08:56,759
A moment...

844
01:08:57,263 --> 01:08:59,983
Do you suspect Tomas Garrido
was the one in the room?

845
01:09:00,083 --> 01:09:00,983
You don't agree?

846
01:09:01,515 --> 01:09:04,233
It's a likely scenario
to build your defense.

847
01:09:04,333 --> 01:09:06,283
It's something that would
convince a judge.

848
01:09:06,809 --> 01:09:10,409
Tomas Garrido had a strong
motive to commit a murder.

849
01:09:12,778 --> 01:09:14,728
If a father knows that the police

850
01:09:14,845 --> 01:09:17,858
protects those responsible for
the disappearance of his son,

851
01:09:17,958 --> 01:09:19,658
he has only one option:

852
01:09:19,894 --> 01:09:22,429
- force you to face it.
- Kill one of us

853
01:09:22,529 --> 01:09:24,733
<i>and incriminate the other it's
a way to get it.</i>

854
01:09:24,833 --> 01:09:27,733
<i>That's right. It
worked perfectly.</i>

855
01:09:28,203 --> 01:09:30,775
<i>Everyone believes you guilty, Mr.
Doria.</i>

856
01:09:30,875 --> 01:09:34,275
<i>The police, your own wife and
even your financial partners.</i>

857
01:09:34,625 --> 01:09:38,036
<i>Tomas Garrido did not only implicate
you for the death of your lover,</i>

858
01:09:38,136 --> 01:09:40,442
<i>but he also ruined your
life and your business.</i>

859
01:09:40,542 --> 01:09:44,142
<i>And only Felix could get you
out with a million dollar bail.</i>

860
01:09:44,826 --> 01:09:46,733
<i>Together, they created
the conspiracy theory.</i>

861
01:09:46,833 --> 01:09:49,604
<i>And I suspect he came
to see me and then hire me</i>

862
01:09:49,887 --> 01:09:52,237
<i>because he wasn't capable
of handling it himself.</i>

863
01:09:52,341 --> 01:09:55,964
<i>His lawyer knew that if you
convinced me with your story,</i>

864
01:09:56,064 --> 01:09:57,964
<i>I would have convinced a jury.</i>

865
01:09:58,125 --> 01:10:01,178
<i>Did you hire someone to tell me
what to say at trial, Felix?</i>

866
01:10:01,278 --> 01:10:03,733
<i>She's the best witness
coach around.</i>

867
01:10:03,833 --> 01:10:07,483
<i>Two weeks ago, she was about to retire,
but she took this as her last case.</i>

868
01:10:07,583 --> 01:10:10,633
And I guarantee you she's
not going to lose.

869
01:10:11,083 --> 01:10:11,933
Now then,

870
01:10:12,233 --> 01:10:15,672
the only way you have to prove
you didn't kill your mistress,

871
01:10:15,772 --> 01:10:17,622
is to implicate Tomas Garrido.

872
01:10:17,976 --> 01:10:21,676
And that means confessing what
you did to his son.

873
01:10:25,222 --> 01:10:29,372
Yes, but that's useless without explaining
how he got out of the room without a trace.

874
01:10:29,790 --> 01:10:32,650
<i>I assure you that when I
woke up, there was no one in the room.</i>

875
01:10:32,750 --> 01:10:33,550
Help!

876
01:10:34,234 --> 01:10:35,134
Police!

877
01:10:36,792 --> 01:10:40,692
Are you familiar with the concept
of lateral thinking, Mr. Doria?

878
01:10:42,333 --> 01:10:44,802
It consists in the technique
of changing the perspective

879
01:10:44,902 --> 01:10:47,352
from which events are analyzed.

880
01:10:47,750 --> 01:10:48,800
For example...

881
01:10:49,378 --> 01:10:52,078
in a timber barn which is completely
empty

882
01:10:52,333 --> 01:10:55,883
a man is found hanging in the
center of the carrier beam.

883
01:10:56,992 --> 01:10:59,734
The rope, with which he hanged
himself is three meters long

884
01:10:59,834 --> 01:11:02,417
and his feet hang 30 centimeters
above the ground.

885
01:11:03,833 --> 01:11:06,520
The closest wall is 6 meters away.

886
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:10,317
It's not possible to climb on
the wall, or on the beam.

887
01:11:10,417 --> 01:11:12,650
Yet, the man hanged himself.

888
01:11:14,205 --> 01:11:15,405
How did he do it?

889
01:11:17,588 --> 01:11:21,038
He climbed on a block of ice which
gradually melted in the heat.

890
01:11:22,105 --> 01:11:24,005
This is our barn.

891
01:11:27,146 --> 01:11:30,246
The police's photographic archive of
your case.

892
01:11:34,628 --> 01:11:38,545
And the answer must be in
the statement of the facts.

893
01:11:44,410 --> 01:11:48,060
- I don't know what you expect to see.
- The details, Mr. Doria.

894
01:11:48,521 --> 01:11:50,271
You dwell on the details.

895
01:11:51,623 --> 01:11:53,193
They have always been
under our noses.

896
01:11:53,194 --> 01:11:54,581
<i>Adrian Doria arrested for murder</i>

897
01:11:54,625 --> 01:11:58,004
But they have to be analyzed
from a different perspective.

898
01:12:00,902 --> 01:12:04,602
What if the answer to the enigma
had never been inside the room,

899
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:07,108
but rather, outside?

900
01:12:07,208 --> 01:12:10,733
Now, he works near Bierge, in the
valley, 20 minutes from home.

901
01:12:10,833 --> 01:12:13,733
It was no accident that he
chose a hotel so isolated.

902
01:12:13,833 --> 01:12:16,133
Tomas Garrido set up
a trap for you.

903
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,750
<i>He must have sent
the package to him,</i>

904
01:12:21,625 --> 01:12:25,375
<i>so that you mistakenly assembled
the pieces of your puzzle,</i>

905
01:12:25,625 --> 01:12:28,666
<i>Making it so you'd doubt
what actually happened'</i>

906
01:12:28,766 --> 01:12:30,798
<i>Because he knew that this way</i>

907
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,250
<i>he would find the missing piece.</i>

908
01:12:34,833 --> 01:12:35,533
<i>Yes?</i>

909
01:12:36,191 --> 01:12:38,367
I look forward to seeing you at the
Hotel Bellavista.

910
01:12:38,467 --> 01:12:40,496
It makes no sense, he
couldn't have known about the swamp.

911
01:12:40,521 --> 01:12:43,525
The area where you buried the lad
is full of swampy lakes.

912
01:12:43,625 --> 01:12:45,508
And the locals know it.

913
01:12:45,608 --> 01:12:49,330
For Tomas Garrido, it was
enough to toss a coin in the air

914
01:12:49,994 --> 01:12:52,094
and wait for you to pick it up.

915
01:12:55,292 --> 01:12:56,492
<i>And you did.</i>

916
01:12:57,187 --> 01:12:59,744
<i>- Is that what happened?
- You gave yourself up,</i>

917
01:13:00,897 --> 01:13:03,197
and, at the right time,
you handed Laura over.

918
01:14:36,420 --> 01:14:38,131
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

919
01:14:38,231 --> 01:14:40,301
I have a reservation.
Room 715...

920
01:14:40,401 --> 01:14:42,024
That's how Tomas Garrido

921
01:14:42,124 --> 01:14:45,358
could get in the room without
leaving any evidence.

922
01:14:45,458 --> 01:14:49,838
He just had to wait for you and
Laura to get up to the room.

923
01:14:50,110 --> 01:14:53,210
<i>From there, he could send
the SMS with Laura's phone.</i>

924
01:14:53,917 --> 01:14:56,858
He just sent us a text message
with your mobile phone.

925
01:14:56,958 --> 01:15:00,008
<i>And then hit you to
put you out of action</i>

926
01:15:02,784 --> 01:15:05,284
completing the perfect crime.

927
01:15:07,667 --> 01:15:08,662
If this was the case,

928
01:15:08,762 --> 01:15:12,446
Tomas Garrido had set up the
stage for blaming you

929
01:15:12,546 --> 01:15:15,746
and disappear through the road
that his wife had indicated.

930
01:15:16,565 --> 01:15:18,765
<i>He left the money
to incriminate you.</i>

931
01:15:19,067 --> 01:15:21,667
<i>Left Laura's phone in the room</i>

932
01:15:23,030 --> 01:15:26,980
<i>and made sure that your fingerprints
were on the murder weapon.</i>

933
01:15:39,438 --> 01:15:40,238
Hello.

934
01:15:40,972 --> 01:15:42,022
Is everything all right?

935
01:15:43,500 --> 01:15:45,750
Well, nobody left the room.

936
01:15:51,083 --> 01:15:52,283
Hello?

937
01:16:25,047 --> 01:16:26,733
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

938
01:16:26,833 --> 01:16:30,472
- Where did the noises come from?
- In a suite, the 715.

939
01:16:55,375 --> 01:16:58,075
Stand back.
Stand back, please!

940
01:17:03,789 --> 01:17:04,689
Police!

941
01:17:05,531 --> 01:17:06,731
Open the door.

942
01:17:23,373 --> 01:17:24,473
Everybody out!

943
01:17:28,336 --> 01:17:29,932
Bring forensics.

944
01:17:30,032 --> 01:17:33,175
Guys, we have to call the forensics.
We found a body.

945
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:48,169
<i>The boy's mother was the reason
why they sent us to that hotel.</i>

946
01:17:48,269 --> 01:17:51,092
<i>All she had to do was make her
husband disappear from the room</i>

947
01:17:51,192 --> 01:17:53,442
<i>to implicate me as the guilty one.</i>

948
01:17:54,086 --> 01:17:56,600
<i>The police never connected
her to you</i>

949
01:17:56,700 --> 01:18:00,400
<i>because Felix did away with
your name in her son's case.</i>

950
01:18:02,214 --> 01:18:03,164
Excuse me.

951
01:18:07,445 --> 01:18:08,245
Tell me.

952
01:18:10,206 --> 01:18:11,256
Confirmed?

953
01:18:12,845 --> 01:18:14,245
One hundred percent?

954
01:18:15,922 --> 01:18:17,672
OK. Thank you.

955
01:18:18,783 --> 01:18:20,533
Is it about the prosecution witness?

956
01:18:20,665 --> 01:18:23,865
We don't yet know the
name, but we know who he is.

957
01:18:24,327 --> 01:18:25,627
The passerby driver.

958
01:18:26,594 --> 01:18:30,026
- It forces us to think fast.
- It also means that I'm fucked.

959
01:18:30,126 --> 01:18:32,226
Not entirely, if you obey me.

960
01:18:32,792 --> 01:18:35,393
Suppose that you did not stay
at the cottage with your lover

961
01:18:35,493 --> 01:18:37,047
the day of the incident.

962
01:18:37,147 --> 01:18:39,525
You were in Paris, as per your alibi.

963
01:18:39,625 --> 01:18:42,549
It was Laura who rented the place.
Her name is on record.

964
01:18:45,997 --> 01:18:48,545
<i>So you were not present</i>

965
01:18:48,778 --> 01:18:51,109
<i>when the accident that
killed Daniel Garrido took place.</i>

966
01:18:51,209 --> 01:18:52,009
Hey...

967
01:18:53,308 --> 01:18:56,079
The license plates and other
evidence is circumstantial

968
01:18:56,179 --> 01:18:58,949
and, of course, it was Laura
to put the plan into action

969
01:18:59,049 --> 01:19:02,425
<i>by faking the boy's escape
for embezzlement.</i>

970
01:19:05,177 --> 01:19:06,876
<i>We have to convince the judge</i>

971
01:19:06,976 --> 01:19:09,559
<i>that you were just another one
of Laura's victim,</i>

972
01:19:09,659 --> 01:19:13,233
<i>and that you ended up in that hotel
room because she asked for your help.</i>

973
01:19:13,333 --> 01:19:16,475
<i>It could be you might not have known anything
about Daniel Garrido until that moment,</i>

974
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:19,650
<i>while the father unjustly
accuse you of the disappearance.</i>

975
01:19:19,750 --> 01:19:22,450
You want to turn me into Laura's victim?

976
01:19:22,871 --> 01:19:24,821
The only piece missing

977
01:19:25,576 --> 01:19:28,503
is to connect her directly
with Daniel's body.

978
01:19:28,603 --> 01:19:30,803
And tell me something...
how do you plan to do it?

979
01:19:32,011 --> 01:19:35,561
We have to hide something of Laura's
in the boy's car.

980
01:19:35,815 --> 01:19:39,991
We have to incriminate her of
Daniel's disappearance.

981
01:19:43,419 --> 01:19:44,819
Your only crime

982
01:19:45,261 --> 01:19:48,561
is aiding and abetting due to
a guilty conscience.

983
01:19:59,829 --> 01:20:01,479
Where did you sink the car?

984
01:20:04,333 --> 01:20:06,598
We'll give the location of the
body anonymously.

985
01:20:06,698 --> 01:20:08,548
You won't have to admit anything.

986
01:20:08,698 --> 01:20:11,067
But, without a body there
is no crime and without a crime...

987
01:20:11,167 --> 01:20:14,139
there is no way to persuade a
jury that Laura's murder

988
01:20:14,239 --> 01:20:16,358
was not a crime of passion.

989
01:20:16,458 --> 01:20:18,684
We will stay to the true facts
just close enough,

990
01:20:18,784 --> 01:20:20,534
so you don't get burned.

991
01:20:20,917 --> 01:20:25,117
How could I not get burned if the
prosecution holds the most important card?

992
01:20:25,362 --> 01:20:26,692
- Hello.
- Hello.

993
01:20:26,792 --> 01:20:29,594
<i>The passerby driver will place me
at the scene of the accident.</i>

994
01:20:28,468 --> 01:20:29,692
Do you need help?

995
01:20:29,693 --> 01:20:31,613
Felix has been looking for
him to neutralize him.

996
01:20:31,699 --> 01:20:33,599
The prosecution has no witness.

997
01:20:34,893 --> 01:20:37,643
- What are you saying?
- Nobody has met with the judge.

998
01:20:38,041 --> 01:20:40,713
It was my invention, which I
gradually shaped,

999
01:20:40,813 --> 01:20:43,013
with the details you gave me.

1000
01:20:43,914 --> 01:20:45,150
You've been leading me on?

1001
01:20:45,250 --> 01:20:48,400
Why didn't you tell me the truth
from the beginning?

1002
01:20:52,061 --> 01:20:55,961
To see if it was possible to get rid
of Tomas Garrido from the room.

1003
01:20:58,795 --> 01:21:01,445
I've always known that
he was the culprit.

1004
01:21:04,071 --> 01:21:07,821
It was also easy to discover that
his wife worked at the hotel.

1005
01:21:09,750 --> 01:21:12,026
And did you wait for me to tell you?

1006
01:21:12,126 --> 01:21:15,020
To make sure that I could
put my life in your hands,

1007
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:16,420
Ms. Goodman.

1008
01:21:21,049 --> 01:21:22,699
Where did you put it?

1009
01:21:31,401 --> 01:21:32,901
This is where I sunk it.

1010
01:21:56,150 --> 01:21:57,750
I have to tell you something else.

1011
01:22:12,122 --> 01:22:14,572
We thought he had died, I swear.

1012
01:22:20,933 --> 01:22:23,400
Laura had taken things too far and
there was no going back.

1013
01:22:23,500 --> 01:22:26,733
If the police found the body
the autopsy would give me away.

1014
01:22:26,833 --> 01:22:30,233
I had to be sure that you
would help me avoid it.

1015
01:22:31,710 --> 01:22:33,810
It's my job to keep you out of jail,

1016
01:22:33,910 --> 01:22:37,710
but I'm not going to save who
you really are, a scum, Mr. Doria.

1017
01:22:37,810 --> 01:22:39,780
And you're have to swallow
what I say to you because...

1018
01:22:39,805 --> 01:22:43,655
The boy was dead without being dead.
I had to decide in an instant.

1019
01:22:45,268 --> 01:22:48,982
Don't lie to yourself.
You're a murderer!

1020
01:22:49,082 --> 01:22:51,246
You're testing me again, right?

1021
01:22:51,346 --> 01:22:53,517
So I can learn to withstand the
prosecution's attacks, right?

1022
01:22:53,542 --> 01:22:55,577
What you told me
changes everything.

1023
01:22:55,677 --> 01:22:57,327
Now, you are in my hands.

1024
01:22:58,463 --> 01:23:02,968
If I get to the judge with what you
told me, you are lost!

1025
01:23:03,068 --> 01:23:04,318
You can't do that!

1026
01:23:06,733 --> 01:23:08,383
You hear me? You can't do that.

1027
01:23:08,498 --> 01:23:11,297
That's what the prosecutor
is looking for.

1028
01:23:11,397 --> 01:23:12,897
Your desperation.

1029
01:23:13,099 --> 01:23:15,817
And look how easy it was
to provoke it.

1030
01:23:15,917 --> 01:23:17,835
Do you want to insult me?
Go ahead.

1031
01:23:18,417 --> 01:23:22,900
That's also what the prosecutor is looking for.
That the arrogant idiot that is inside comes out.

1032
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:23,800
Enough!

1033
01:23:27,087 --> 01:23:29,087
Are you are not here to defend me?

1034
01:23:31,184 --> 01:23:32,634
Then, do it.

1035
01:23:52,814 --> 01:23:56,764
I will not let your case from
staining my record, on the last day.

1036
01:23:58,636 --> 01:24:01,542
From now on, we'll do things my way.

1037
01:24:02,287 --> 01:24:05,424
So, I must be certain that there
are no loose ends in your story.

1038
01:24:05,524 --> 01:24:06,809
- There are none.
- No?

1039
01:24:06,909 --> 01:24:09,259
Because I think you are still
trying to manipulate me.

1040
01:24:09,583 --> 01:24:12,016
Testing on me your distorted
version of the facts,

1041
01:24:12,116 --> 01:24:14,556
- like I was your puppet.
- What is it that you don't believe?

1042
01:24:14,583 --> 01:24:17,430
It's true that everything could
have happened as you said.

1043
01:24:17,530 --> 01:24:22,025
But... what if it wasn't you that broke
the promise never to meet again,

1044
01:24:22,272 --> 01:24:23,275
but rather Laura?

1045
01:24:23,375 --> 01:24:26,754
Can I know what you did to cause the police
to believe that Daniel has run away?

1046
01:24:26,854 --> 01:24:28,364
Come in 4 hours at the bar,

1047
01:24:28,464 --> 01:24:30,398
<i>- in front of the scrap yard.</i>
- All right.

1048
01:24:30,498 --> 01:24:32,733
<i>- Don't be late.</i>
- All right. I'll be there.

1049
01:24:32,833 --> 01:24:35,648
<i>Withdrawal of small amounts
from the customers' accounts,</i>

1050
01:24:35,748 --> 01:24:37,498
<i>shortly before disappearing.</i>

1051
01:24:38,875 --> 01:24:41,825
<i>You also could have gotten a
hold of the lad's things.</i>

1052
01:24:42,333 --> 01:24:44,283
Adrian, what does all of this mean?

1053
01:24:44,647 --> 01:24:46,097
The lad's wallet.

1054
01:24:47,135 --> 01:24:50,235
I took it before I stuffed
him into the trunk.

1055
01:24:51,062 --> 01:24:54,517
- Set a price. Thank you.
<i>- You've always had the means and contacts,</i>

1056
01:24:54,617 --> 01:24:56,638
to change the course of events,

1057
01:24:56,738 --> 01:24:59,785
<i>- without leaving tell-tale tracks.</i>
- I'll take care of it.

1058
01:25:00,223 --> 01:25:01,173
That's false.

1059
01:25:02,099 --> 01:25:04,692
- You can't prove it.
- Neither can you.

1060
01:25:04,792 --> 01:25:06,692
Let's see everything in reverse.

1061
01:25:08,116 --> 01:25:08,718
Hey?

1062
01:25:08,818 --> 01:25:10,514
<i>Would the pieces fit,</i>

1063
01:25:10,614 --> 01:25:13,678
<i>if it was you who took
the initiative?</i>

1064
01:25:13,875 --> 01:25:15,715
- What are you doing?
- I'm calling the police.

1065
01:25:15,789 --> 01:25:19,027
Listen, it wasn't our fault,
it was the fucking deer.

1066
01:25:19,127 --> 01:25:20,327
Are you crazy?

1067
01:25:21,707 --> 01:25:24,068
- What if he saw something?
- He hasn't seen anything.

1068
01:25:24,168 --> 01:25:25,668
We have to rid of him.

1069
01:25:28,750 --> 01:25:30,954
<i>And if it was Laura
Vidal who was dragged to</i>

1070
01:25:31,054 --> 01:25:33,704
<i>an extreme situation
out of control?</i>

1071
01:25:36,313 --> 01:25:38,363
According to this medical report,

1072
01:25:38,501 --> 01:25:41,415
your mistress suffered from
severe anxiety attacks,

1073
01:25:41,515 --> 01:25:44,565
<i>after your return from your
alleged trip to Paris.</i>

1074
01:25:45,333 --> 01:25:48,158
<i>Even a ruthless person like
her could collapse.</i>

1075
01:25:48,258 --> 01:25:51,308
That's precisely what it does not
agree with me, Mr. Doria.

1076
01:25:51,901 --> 01:25:53,826
That she had been the real instigator
of everything,

1077
01:25:53,851 --> 01:25:56,567
it would strengthen the belief
that you would save that youngster.

1078
01:25:56,667 --> 01:25:58,567
Instead, you drowned him!

1079
01:26:02,402 --> 01:26:04,903
<i>Parents fear it is not a
voluntary disappearance</i>

1080
01:26:07,128 --> 01:26:10,228
<i>It was she that bore such a weight
on her conscience,</i>

1081
01:26:12,889 --> 01:26:15,189
<i>that, little by little,
made her collapse.</i>

1082
01:26:22,383 --> 01:26:25,783
<i>The impresario Adrian Doria has
just received the prize...</i>

1083
01:26:28,493 --> 01:26:32,297
<i>Until she realized that there was only
one way to regain their dignity'.</i>

1084
01:26:38,210 --> 01:26:41,257
<i>By now, she could no longer return
the child to those poor parents.</i>

1085
01:26:42,073 --> 01:26:43,733
There was my friend and...

1086
01:26:43,833 --> 01:26:46,133
<i>But there was
something she could do.</i>

1087
01:26:47,372 --> 01:26:48,922
<i>Tell them the truth.</i>

1088
01:26:53,027 --> 01:26:53,977
Daniel...

1089
01:26:55,248 --> 01:26:59,022
<i>So she met them at the hotel
where the lad's mother was employed.</i>

1090
01:26:59,122 --> 01:27:02,472
<i>A secluded spot in which
to put her plan in action.</i>

1091
01:27:03,250 --> 01:27:06,300
<i>She went to Bierge alone
through the valley.</i>

1092
01:27:08,550 --> 01:27:11,300
<i>And when she got to the
hotel station,</i>

1093
01:27:11,856 --> 01:27:15,706
<i>She call you from a pay phone
so you wouldn't suspect anything.</i>

1094
01:27:18,663 --> 01:27:20,192
Someone knows something.

1095
01:27:20,292 --> 01:27:23,654
<i>She made you believe that the
passerby driver had seen something.</i>

1096
01:27:23,754 --> 01:27:25,329
...then why the fuck are you
using the phone?

1097
01:27:25,354 --> 01:27:28,154
<i>That he had found her and
was blackmailing her.</i>

1098
01:27:29,228 --> 01:27:33,378
<i>It was her way of trying to compensate
those poor people for their loss.</i>

1099
01:27:33,834 --> 01:27:37,284
<i>She didn't have the courage to
confess it all empty-handed.</i>

1100
01:27:38,750 --> 01:27:41,650
<i>Once in the room, all she
had to do is wait.</i>

1101
01:27:42,526 --> 01:27:45,178
<i>Then she set in motion the
second part of the plan.</i>

1102
01:27:45,502 --> 01:27:49,152
<i>She wrote a text message on her
cell phone as a protection measure.</i>

1103
01:27:51,610 --> 01:27:54,360
<i>Laura knew you would refuse
to confess.</i>

1104
01:27:54,917 --> 01:27:58,049
<i>Because you only care about
one thing: yourself.</i>

1105
01:28:03,667 --> 01:28:07,717
<i>So you made sure that nobody would see you
getting into the room where Laura was waiting.</i>

1106
01:28:15,723 --> 01:28:19,123
<i>But Laura had already
reached the point of no return.</i>

1107
01:28:20,062 --> 01:28:23,107
<i>When she told you what she intended
to do, you lost control</i>

1108
01:28:23,207 --> 01:28:24,857
Read your message.

1109
01:28:31,590 --> 01:28:33,779
<i>And when you received
the programmed SMS,</i>

1110
01:28:33,879 --> 01:28:36,299
<i>you understood you had fallen
into her trap.</i>

1111
01:28:46,335 --> 01:28:48,685
The reservation is also in your name.

1112
01:28:50,850 --> 01:28:52,400
Let's give them the money.

1113
01:28:53,792 --> 01:28:55,864
You're going to tell them where
their son's body is

1114
01:28:55,964 --> 01:28:57,464
and we're going to surrender...

1115
01:28:58,288 --> 01:28:59,138
Adrian.

1116
01:29:01,621 --> 01:29:03,221
There's no going back.

1117
01:29:25,598 --> 01:29:26,798
I didn't kill her

1118
01:29:27,251 --> 01:29:31,022
and I'll never admit to it in front
of a jury, do you understand?

1119
01:29:31,122 --> 01:29:35,122
You killed and became trapped in
a room where it was not possible to escape.

1120
01:29:38,218 --> 01:29:40,452
Hello?
Is everything alright?

1121
01:29:51,833 --> 01:29:54,983
<i>You thought the SMS could be useful,</i>

1122
01:29:55,625 --> 01:29:59,375
<i>And you looked for the elements on which
to base your convoluted theory.</i>

1123
01:30:06,585 --> 01:30:07,485
Police!

1124
01:30:10,516 --> 01:30:11,566
You look fine?

1125
01:30:15,028 --> 01:30:15,928
Police!

1126
01:30:19,208 --> 01:30:19,958
Good.

1127
01:30:20,808 --> 01:30:22,058
Do you want to play?

1128
01:30:22,631 --> 01:30:23,681
Let's do it.

1129
01:30:24,870 --> 01:30:27,358
Why did Tomas Garrido and
his wife have not spoken up?

1130
01:30:27,601 --> 01:30:30,977
If Laura call them to tell the truth
Why did they not tell the police?

1131
01:30:31,077 --> 01:30:32,757
Those parents know you

1132
01:30:32,857 --> 01:30:36,067
will never incriminated yourself
and tell them where their son is buried.

1133
01:30:36,167 --> 01:30:39,586
Without a body, it is very
difficult to prove a murder,

1134
01:30:39,686 --> 01:30:43,817
and that you're capable of
anything just to remain free,

1135
01:30:44,958 --> 01:30:47,758
including blaming them for the
death of your mistress.

1136
01:30:49,674 --> 01:30:50,824
Come with me.

1137
01:31:02,998 --> 01:31:05,848
Second window to the right of the
penultimate floor.

1138
01:31:07,564 --> 01:31:09,932
Look carefully, Mr. Doria.

1139
01:31:16,135 --> 01:31:19,335
Tomas Garrido has stopped counting
on the police for some time now.

1140
01:31:19,553 --> 01:31:24,101
And, since then, he's been watching you
planning take the law into his own hands.

1141
01:31:35,773 --> 01:31:37,498
You assume things that you can not know.

1142
01:31:37,598 --> 01:31:39,438
About Tomas Garrido I know more
than you think.

1143
01:31:39,500 --> 01:31:40,400
Why?

1144
01:31:40,809 --> 01:31:44,159
- You're very smart, make an effort.
- I want an answer.

1145
01:31:45,715 --> 01:31:48,155
<i>When Tomas and his wife
arrived at the hotel</i>

1146
01:31:48,255 --> 01:31:50,314
<i>they learned of Laura's death.</i>

1147
01:31:50,414 --> 01:31:52,214
<i>they realized what had happened.</i>

1148
01:31:53,221 --> 01:31:56,980
<i>Of course, they examined the options
and hesitated about what to do.</i>

1149
01:31:57,080 --> 01:31:59,421
<i>But, not trusting in the
justice system, what did they have left?</i>

1150
01:31:59,446 --> 01:32:01,546
Study the enemy and wait.

1151
01:32:02,125 --> 01:32:04,375
To watch you.

1152
01:32:12,125 --> 01:32:15,025
<i>Tomas Garrido became
a shadow in the shadows.</i>

1153
01:32:20,882 --> 01:32:23,442
<i>He found an apartment
in front of your building</i>

1154
01:32:23,542 --> 01:32:26,142
<i>and managed to occupy it
anonymously.</i>

1155
01:32:26,562 --> 01:32:27,762
<i>And since then...</i>

1156
01:32:28,319 --> 01:32:32,157
<i>he's kept you and anybody else that came in
contact with you under constant surveillance.</i>

1157
01:32:32,522 --> 01:32:36,856
<i>Every meeting, every conversation,
every move to get away</i>

1158
01:32:37,458 --> 01:32:40,008
<i>Tomas Garrido was there '
to take advantage.</i>

1159
01:32:41,084 --> 01:32:43,261
And of course, that includes me too.

1160
01:32:50,586 --> 01:32:54,186
<i>Who was that man and that he was
doing in front of my office?</i>

1161
01:32:57,883 --> 01:33:01,133
<i>I realized that he had arrived there
following Felix's footsteps.</i>

1162
01:33:01,620 --> 01:33:04,770
<i>So I arranged for surveillance to
find out his movements.</i>

1163
01:33:05,185 --> 01:33:07,235
<i>VG - Virginia Goodman - Attorney</i>

1164
01:33:07,862 --> 01:33:11,248
It was the boy's father that brought
you here, not the other way around.

1165
01:33:11,348 --> 01:33:14,548
He gave you the thread to
get to Daniel Garrido.

1166
01:33:23,492 --> 01:33:26,709
This picture shows that everything could
have happened in a way that benefits me.

1167
01:33:26,917 --> 01:33:29,921
You're still not listening and not
paying attention to the details.

1168
01:33:30,125 --> 01:33:31,627
The lad's mother was in the room.

1169
01:33:31,788 --> 01:33:34,213
That day she was off work,
I just told you.

1170
01:33:34,313 --> 01:33:36,409
They went to the hotel because they
had arranged a meeting with Laura.

1171
01:33:36,434 --> 01:33:40,734
- I tell you that this photo shows...
- This picture is fake, Mr. Doria!

1172
01:33:42,558 --> 01:33:44,508
And it's rigged. It's a composite.

1173
01:33:47,742 --> 01:33:49,992
Look at the reflection
in the mirror.

1174
01:33:56,433 --> 01:33:57,933
And now, tell me...

1175
01:33:58,529 --> 01:33:59,979
Do you want my help?

1176
01:34:00,566 --> 01:34:04,036
Do you want to make sure the judge believes
you're not a murderer? Well, then...

1177
01:34:04,136 --> 01:34:06,986
- admit that you killed Laura...
- I killed her.

1178
01:34:24,375 --> 01:34:27,114
<i>Adrian, are you there?
You have your cell phone turned off.</i>

1179
01:34:27,657 --> 01:34:29,207
Call me as soon as you can.

1180
01:34:30,017 --> 01:34:32,617
The miracle that we were expecting
has happened.

1181
01:34:45,368 --> 01:34:47,568
Talk to him.
It seems important.

1182
01:34:48,806 --> 01:34:51,656
Let's take 10 minutes rest and
then we'll resume from the beginning.

1183
01:34:52,625 --> 01:34:54,970
I know the strategy for your defense.

1184
01:34:55,070 --> 01:34:56,370
Rest assured.

1185
01:34:57,373 --> 01:34:59,483
I am going out for a bit
to clear my mind.

1186
01:34:59,583 --> 01:35:01,083
- Do you have coffee?
- Yes.

1187
01:35:02,093 --> 01:35:04,693
We'll need it.
It will be long night.

1188
01:35:05,208 --> 01:35:05,958
OK.

1189
01:35:15,333 --> 01:35:16,733
Mrs. Goodman?

1190
01:35:25,082 --> 01:35:25,932
Thank you.

1191
01:35:54,250 --> 01:35:55,797
- Felix?
- I was looking for you.

1192
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:59,150
- The cell phone was turned off. What's up'?
<i>- I found him.</i>

1193
01:35:59,461 --> 01:36:01,811
You were never on that road.

1194
01:36:02,903 --> 01:36:04,303
Can we trust him?

1195
01:36:09,660 --> 01:36:10,660
Totally.

1196
01:36:16,260 --> 01:36:17,910
What about Virginia Goodman?

1197
01:36:18,323 --> 01:36:19,923
I had to tell her everything.

1198
01:36:20,792 --> 01:36:21,592
<i>Everything?</i>

1199
01:36:22,507 --> 01:36:23,307
Everything.

1200
01:36:23,719 --> 01:36:25,019
And how do you feel?

1201
01:36:26,292 --> 01:36:27,242
You were right.

1202
01:36:27,682 --> 01:36:28,982
She's very good.

1203
01:36:30,524 --> 01:36:31,874
Can we trust her.

1204
01:36:34,375 --> 01:36:38,650
Tell me, what was the matter with the prosecution?
With the plane's noise, I couldn't hear you.

1205
01:36:38,750 --> 01:36:40,500
Nothing, nothing. Don't worry.

1206
01:36:42,591 --> 01:36:44,091
What the hell was that?

1207
01:36:45,875 --> 01:36:47,175
Felix, can you hear me?

1208
01:36:55,292 --> 01:36:56,542
Adrian, are you there?

1209
01:36:56,884 --> 01:36:58,934
Give me a moment.
I'll call you.

1210
01:37:00,588 --> 01:37:01,488
Shit...

1211
01:37:16,375 --> 01:37:18,469
<i>No one has met the judge.</i>

1212
01:37:18,708 --> 01:37:20,608
The prosecution has no witnesses.

1213
01:37:22,091 --> 01:37:24,454
It was all my invention, which I
shaped, gradually,

1214
01:37:24,554 --> 01:37:26,470
with the details you gave me.

1215
01:37:26,570 --> 01:37:29,858
- I tell her that this photo shows...
- This picture's fake, Mr. Doria!

1216
01:37:29,958 --> 01:37:31,908
And it's faked. It's a composite.

1217
01:37:32,417 --> 01:37:34,121
You presume things you can not know.

1218
01:37:34,221 --> 01:37:36,125
On Garrido I know more
than you think.

1219
01:37:36,225 --> 01:37:38,975
- Because'?
- You're smart, make and effort.

1220
01:37:39,750 --> 01:37:42,316
My wife and I know that
our son is dead.

1221
01:37:42,416 --> 01:37:45,201
We only want to find him just to bury him
and may he rest in peace.

1222
01:37:45,301 --> 01:37:47,576
<i>But, not trusting in the
justice system, what did they have left?</i>

1223
01:37:47,601 --> 01:37:49,628
<i>Study the enemy and wait.</i>

1224
01:37:50,351 --> 01:37:53,251
<i>That's how we met.
In a theater group.</i>

1225
01:37:54,833 --> 01:37:59,596
If I get to judge with what you've
told me, you'd be lost!

1226
01:38:00,004 --> 01:38:01,650
Now you're in my hands.

1227
01:38:02,430 --> 01:38:05,130
Adrian, are you there?
Your phone's off.

1228
01:38:07,955 --> 01:38:09,555
Everything is under control.

1229
01:38:13,596 --> 01:38:17,296
And the Garridos suspect that you and
you mistress are the culprits.

1230
01:38:17,510 --> 01:38:21,338
Since she's dead, there's only...
you.

1231
01:38:27,375 --> 01:38:29,025
Where did you sink the body?

1232
01:38:52,621 --> 01:38:55,128
<i>There won't be no salvation
without suffering,</i>

1233
01:38:55,833 --> 01:38:57,927
And you're not smarter than me.

1234
01:41:02,092 --> 01:41:03,442
<i>Police, can I help you?</i>

1235
01:41:03,718 --> 01:41:04,868
Mr. Doria?

1236
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:06,387
<i>My name is Tomas Garrido.</i>

1237
01:41:06,487 --> 01:41:08,087
I'm Virginia Goodman.

1238
01:41:08,450 --> 01:41:10,510
<i>I am the father of
Daniel Garrido.</i>

1239
01:41:12,828 --> 01:41:16,228
I want to tell you what really
happened to my son.
