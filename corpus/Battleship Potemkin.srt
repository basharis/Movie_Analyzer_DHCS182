Part one.
"MEN AND MAGGOTS."

11
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:11,528
The spirit of revolution
soared over the Russian land.

12
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:15,491
A tremendous, mysterious process
was taking place in countless hearts.

13
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:20,079
The individual personality, having hardly
had time to become conscious of itself...

14
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:24,875
dissolved in the mass, and the mass itself
became dissolved in the revolutionary élan.

15
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:35,344
Sailors Matyushenko and Vakulinchuk.

16
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:43,602
We, the sailors of Potemkin,
must support the workers, our brothers...

17
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:48,482
and stand among the front lines
of the revolution!

18
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:59,034
Heavy and gloomy is the sleep
of the off duty.

19
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:51,587
Attentive, but clumsy.

20
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,883
He vents his anger on a young man.

21
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,949
Hurtful...

22
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:29,416
Vakulinchuk 

23
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:38,926
Comrades! The time has come
when we too must speak out.

24
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:55,025
Why wait? All of Russia has risen!
Are we to be the last?

25
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:13,335
Morning.

26
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:26,742
We've had enough rotten meat!

27
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:35,917
Even a dog wouldn't eat this!

28
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,771
The ship doctor Smirnov.

29
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,653
It could crawl overboard on its own!

30
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:26,301
These aren't worms.

31
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:38,522
They are dead fly larvae.
You can wash them off with brine!

32
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:54,871
Russian prisoners in Japan
are fed better than we are!

33
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:58,333
We've had enough rotten meat!

34
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:22,065
It's good meat. End of discussion!

35
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:03,732
Senior Officer Giliarovsky

36
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:09,399
Impotent rage was overflowing.

37
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:27,227
The ship's store.

38
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:02,262
The sailors refused to eat the borscht.

39
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:55,750
GIVE US THIS DAY OUR DAILY BREAD

40
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:32,787
Part two.
"DRAMA ON THE DECK."

41
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,326
Commander Golikov

42
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:45,026
Whoever is satisfied with the borscht

43
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:50,073
take two steps forward!

44
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:55,036
The petty officers.

45
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:15,056
You're free to go!

46
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:23,856
I'll hang the rest on the yard!

47
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:07,942
Call the guards!

48
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:24,125
Matyushenko, under the guise of breaking ranks,
calls the sailors to the gun turret.

49
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:36,804
To the turret...

50
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:43,644
To the turret!

51
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:47,440
To the turret...

52
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:23,518
Guys!...

53
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:25,520
It's time.

54
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:43,412
Most of them gathered by the turret.

55
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:05,101
Stop! Don't move!

56
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:27,081
They try to sneak through the admiral's hatch.

57
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:37,425
Back, scoundrels!
That way is not for you!

58
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:51,814
I'll shoot you all like dogs!

59
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:06,245
Cover them with canvas!

60
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:09,290
Got it!

61
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:01,175
Cover them!

62
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:22,822
Attention!

63
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:57,773
Dear Lord!
Make the disobedient see reason!

64
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:08,743
Fire right into the canvas!

65
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:03,130
Vakulinchuk decides.

66
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:05,299
Fire!

67
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:06,967
BROTHERS!

68
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:09,261
Who are you shooting at?!

69
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:13,307
The rifles quavered.

70
00:23:16,436 --> 00:23:19,105
Shoot!

71
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:22,775
Everyone shoot!

72
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:29,949
Shoot, scum!

73
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:43,170
To the rifles, brothers!

74
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:51,387
Smash the dragons! Smash 'em!

75
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:54,473
Smash 'em all!

76
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:26,273
Have fear of God!

77
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:36,075
Beat it, sorcerer!

78
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:26,787
To the bottom to feed the worms!

79
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:38,674
Brothers! We've won!

80
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:54,940
The bleeding Vakulinchuk flees 
from the furious Giliarovsky.

81
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:38,025
Vakulinchuk's overboard!

82
00:29:52,832 --> 00:29:55,501
Save Vakulinchuk!

83
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:40,754
And he who was first to sound the cry of rebellion
was first to fall at the executioner's hand.

84
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:05,737
To the shore.

85
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:29,970
Odessa.

86
00:31:36,477 --> 00:31:42,399
A tent on the new pier in Odessa
is the final resting place for Vakulinchuk.

87
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:44,359
FOR A SPOONFUL OF BORSCHT

88
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:34,743
Part three.
"THE DEAD MAN CALLS OUT."

89
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:41,083
Mist lingered on from the night...

90
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,791
Rumours came from the pier.

91
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:39,886
Together with the sun,
the news hit the city.

92
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:53,275
The battleship raided...

93
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:01,408
...rebellion...

94
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:16,464
...shore...

95
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:24,556
A killed sailor...

96
00:37:55,147 --> 00:37:56,856
We'll remember.

97
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:10,245
For a spoonful of borscht.

98
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:19,796
"Citizens of Odessa! Lying before you is the body 
of the brutally killed sailor Grigory Vakulinchuk...

99
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:23,800
killed by a senior officer of the squadron 
battleship Prince Tavrichesky.

100
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:27,804
Let's take revenge on the bloodthirsty vampires!
Death to the oppressors!

101
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:31,182
Signed: Crew of the squadron battleship 
Prince Tavrichesky."

102
00:39:02,798 --> 00:39:06,885
Eternal memory to the fallen fighters!

103
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:11,556
All for one.

104
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:19,397
One

105
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:23,568
for all.

106
00:40:09,698 --> 00:40:12,283
Down with the executioners!

107
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:32,679
Down with tyranny!

108
00:40:54,368 --> 00:40:58,705
Mothers and brothers!
Let there not be differences or hostility among us!

109
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:06,880
Smash the Jews!

110
00:41:48,297 --> 00:41:49,923
Shoulder to shoulder.

111
00:41:53,302 --> 00:41:54,928
The land is ours.

112
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:03,561
Tomorrow is ours.

113
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:34,676
A delegate from shore.

114
00:42:37,763 --> 00:42:41,808
The enemy must be dealt a decisive blow!

115
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:48,273
Together with the rebelling workers
from all of Russia

116
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:54,821
WE WILL WIN!

117
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:14,340
The shore watched Potemkin
tensely and attentively.

118
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:54,839
Part four.
"THE ODESSA STAIRCASE."

119
00:43:54,923 --> 00:43:59,218
In those memorable days, the city lived together
with the rebellious battleship.

120
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:09,103
Like a white-winged flock,
boats flew to the battleship.

121
00:48:14,433 --> 00:48:16,142
AND SUDDENLY

122
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:45,499
Let's go! Let's convince them!

123
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:44,350
Listen! Don't shoot!

124
00:52:01,034 --> 00:52:04,537
My boy is badly hurt.

125
00:52:20,595 --> 00:52:21,762
COSSACKS!

126
00:54:35,814 --> 00:54:41,902
And then the brutality of the military authorities in Odessa 
was answered with the battleship's shells.

127
00:54:44,072 --> 00:54:46,699
The target - the Odessa theater.

128
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:50,869
The generals' headquarters.

129
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:13,100
Part five.
"RENDEZVOUS WITH THE SQUADRON."

130
00:55:13,184 --> 00:55:15,853
Turbulent meetings went on until evening.

131
00:55:24,696 --> 00:55:30,909
The people of Odessa are waiting for the liberators!
Land the troops and the army will join you.

132
00:55:53,308 --> 00:55:58,437
Landing is not possible.
The admiral's squadron is coming our way.

133
00:56:26,549 --> 00:56:30,511
With one heart,
they decided to face the squadron.

134
00:56:40,355 --> 00:56:44,525
Night came, full of anxiety.

135
00:57:53,595 --> 00:57:59,558
The squadron was sneaking up in the darkness.

136
00:58:47,482 --> 00:58:53,654
Sore from constant speech,
throats breathe heavily and unevenly.

137
01:00:42,597 --> 01:00:45,057
Squadron on the horizon!

138
01:02:00,133 --> 01:02:02,509
All hands on deck!

139
01:02:09,016 --> 01:02:10,976
Prepare for battle!

140
01:04:06,843 --> 01:04:08,260
Full speed!

141
01:05:24,879 --> 01:05:26,504
Hearts forward!

142
01:06:07,213 --> 01:06:10,715
Top speed!

143
01:06:26,107 --> 01:06:28,858
Potemkin and destroyer No. 267.

144
01:06:32,154 --> 01:06:34,239
The admiral attacks!

145
01:06:51,382 --> 01:06:53,883
The squadron draws near!

146
01:07:33,257 --> 01:07:36,468
Give the signal: join us!

147
01:07:41,724 --> 01:07:43,850
Join!...

148
01:07:46,353 --> 01:07:47,353
...us!

149
01:08:05,915 --> 01:08:08,958
The enemy is within firing range!

150
01:08:19,595 --> 01:08:21,554
All against one.

151
01:08:43,536 --> 01:08:44,869
ONE AGAINST ALL.

152
01:09:11,105 --> 01:09:13,189
Shoot?...

153
01:09:18,404 --> 01:09:19,445
or...

154
01:09:30,374 --> 01:09:31,416
BROTHERS!

155
01:10:02,072 --> 01:10:07,493
Above the heads of the tsar's admirals
thundered a brotherly hurrah.

156
01:10:15,502 --> 01:10:23,009
And proudly waving the red flag of victory, 
without a single shot, the rebellious battleship 
passed through the rows of the squadron.
