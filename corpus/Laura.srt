1
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:11,404
I shall never forget
the weekend Laura died.

2
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:17,201
A silver sun burned through the sky
like a huge magnifying glass.

3
00:01:17,286 --> 00:01:21,497
It was the hottest Sunday
in my recollection.

4
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:25,668
I felt as if I were the only human being
left in New York.

5
00:01:27,463 --> 00:01:30,965
For with Laura's
horrible death, I was alone.

6
00:01:32,384 --> 00:01:35,344
I, Waldo Lydecker

7
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:38,431
was the only one
who really knew her

8
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:44,103
and I had just begun
to write Laura's story when

9
00:01:44,188 --> 00:01:47,523
another of those detectives
came to see me.

10
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:50,526
I had him wait.

11
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:56,282
I could watch him
through the half-open door.

12
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:13,007
I noted that his attention
was fixed upon my clock.

13
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,469
There was only one other
in existence

14
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:19,263
and that was
in Laura's apartment,

15
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:22,391
in the very room
where she was murdered.

16
00:02:26,605 --> 00:02:29,440
Careful there.
That stuff is priceless.

17
00:02:30,609 --> 00:02:32,610
Come in here, please.

18
00:02:39,368 --> 00:02:41,285
Mr. Lydecker?

19
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:43,746
You recognize me. How splendid.

20
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:45,832
Sit down, please.

21
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:50,711
Nice little place
you have here, Mr. Lydecker.

22
00:02:50,796 --> 00:02:54,006
It's lavish,
but I call it home.

23
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:57,260
I suppose you're here
about the Laura Hunt murder.

24
00:02:57,636 --> 00:02:59,595
Yesterday morning,
after Laura's body was found,

25
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,807
I was questioned
by Sergeants McAvity and Schultz,

26
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:04,934
and I stated,

27
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:08,187
"On Friday night, Laura had a dinner
engagement with me"

28
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:11,524
"after which she was ostensibly
going out of town."

29
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:15,778
"She phoned and canceled
our engagement at exactly 7:00."

30
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:17,989
- After that I...
- You "ate a lonely dinner,"

31
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:21,284
"then got into the tub to read."

32
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:23,160
Why did you write it down?

33
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:25,538
Afraid you'd forget it?

34
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:29,208
I am the most widely
misquoted man in America.

35
00:03:29,293 --> 00:03:31,836
When my friends do it,
I resent it.

36
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,298
From Sergeants McAvity and Schultz,
I should find it intolerable.

37
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:38,092
Hand me that washcloth,
please, Mr.

38
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:40,386
Mr.

39
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,388
McPherson.

40
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:45,224
McPherson. McPherson.

41
00:03:45,309 --> 00:03:48,227
Mark McPherson,
the siege of Babylon, Long Island.

42
00:03:48,312 --> 00:03:50,593
The gangster with the machine gun.
Killed three policemen.

43
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:53,107
I told the story over the air
and wrote a column about it.

44
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:55,192
Are you the one
with the leg full of lead,

45
00:03:55,277 --> 00:03:57,570
- the man who walked right in and got him?
- Yeah.

46
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:00,364
Well, well.
Hand me my robe, please.

47
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:07,580
You have a pretty good memory,
Mr. Lydecker.

48
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:11,459
I always liked that detective
with the silver shinbone.

49
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:15,796
Thanks. I hope you won't have any reason
to change your mind about me.

50
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:18,883
- Have you any more questions?
- Yeah, just one.

51
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:21,427
Two years ago,
in your October 17 column,

52
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:23,679
you started out
to write a book review,

53
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:24,764
but at the bottom of the column,

54
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:27,350
you switched over
to the Harrington murder case.

55
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:31,604
Are the processes of the creative mind
now under the jurisdiction of the police?

56
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:36,484
You said Harrington was rubbed out with
a shotgun loaded with buckshot,

57
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:39,362
the way Laura Hunt was murdered
night before last.

58
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:41,364
- Did I?
- Yeah.

59
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:44,450
But he was really killed
with a sash weight.

60
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:48,454
How ordinary.
My version was obviously superior.

61
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:50,498
I never bother
with details, you know.

62
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:53,542
I do. Well, so long.

63
00:04:54,586 --> 00:04:57,004
Mind if I go with you?

64
00:04:57,089 --> 00:05:00,633
- What for?
- Murder is my favorite crime.

65
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:02,760
I write about it regularly,

66
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:06,847
and I know you'll have to visit everyone
on your list of suspects.

67
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:09,016
I'd like to study
their reactions.

68
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:11,894
- You're on the list yourself, you know.
- Good.

69
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:15,481
To have overlooked me
would have been a pointed insult.

70
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:19,235
You're not the sort of man
one would insult, Mr. Lydecker.

71
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:22,279
- Do you really suspect me?
- Yes.

72
00:05:22,364 --> 00:05:26,409
McPherson, if you know anything
about faces, look at mine.

73
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:32,081
How singularly innocent
I look this morning.

74
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:35,418
Have you ever seen
such candid eyes?

75
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:42,675
Something you confiscated
in a raid on a kindergarten?

76
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:47,013
Takes a lot of control.
Would you like to try it?

77
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:49,432
No, thanks.

78
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:52,351
Were you in love
with Laura Hunt, Mr. Lydecker?

79
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:57,356
Was she in love with you?

80
00:05:57,441 --> 00:05:59,859
Laura considered me
the wisest, the wittiest,

81
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:02,987
the most interesting man
she'd ever met.

82
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:05,781
I was in complete accord
with her on that point.

83
00:06:06,825 --> 00:06:08,868
She thought me also
the kindest,

84
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:11,120
the gentlest,

85
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,622
the most sympathetic man
in the world.

86
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:16,292
Did you agree
with her there too?

87
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,753
McPherson,
you won't understand this,

88
00:06:20,005 --> 00:06:23,549
but I tried to become
the kindest, the gentlest,

89
00:06:24,468 --> 00:06:26,635
the most sympathetic man
in the world.

90
00:06:26,845 --> 00:06:29,138
Have any luck?

91
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:32,433
Let me put it this way.

92
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:37,104
I should be sincerely sorry to see my
neighbors' children devoured by wolves.

93
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,689
Shall we go?

94
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:04,799
- Good morning, Lieutenant.
- Good morning, Mrs. Treadwell.

95
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:06,133
- Waldo.
- Good morning, Ann.

96
00:07:06,218 --> 00:07:09,512
- I've just taken over the Laura Hunt case.
- Won't you sit down?

97
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,598
Thanks. I have all the reports,

98
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:15,059
but there are a few more questions
I'd like to ask.

99
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:16,811
Certainly. I'll do anything
I can to help.

100
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:19,021
You were fond of your niece,
Mrs. Treadwell?

101
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:21,107
Why, I adored her. Cigarette?

102
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:24,193
No, thanks. You collapsed when
you identified the body.

103
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:28,364
I can quite understand that. A shotgun
loaded with buckshot, close range.

104
00:07:28,532 --> 00:07:31,617
- It's not very nice to look at.
- It was horrible.

105
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:34,328
Her maid Bessie, I suppose
she was devoted to Miss Hunt?

106
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:37,706
She worshipped her.
Laura had had her for years.

107
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:40,960
I'll never forget her scream
when she saw Laura lying there.

108
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:45,005
Did you approve of Miss Hunt's
coming marriage to Mr. Carpenter?

109
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:48,717
Why? Shouldn't I approve?

110
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:52,888
I don't know. What is your relationship
with Mr. Carpenter?

111
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:54,974
What do you mean?

112
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:58,060
What I mean is, he's been
a frequent guest in your home.

113
00:07:58,145 --> 00:08:00,896
Is he an acquaintance? Friend?
Are you in love with him?

114
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:02,982
This is beginning to assume
fabulous aspects.

115
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:05,818
Oh, shut up, Waldo!
What are you driving at?

116
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:09,321
The truth, Mrs. Treadwell.
Are you in love with him?

117
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:14,994
Why, no. I'm very fond
of Mr. Carpenter, of course.

118
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:17,329
- Everybody is.
- I'm not. I'll be hanged if I am.

119
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:19,832
Oh, don't be
so annoying, Waldo!

120
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,959
Did you give
Mr. Carpenter money?

121
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:23,752
What do you mean?

122
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:26,237
A couple of checks went through
your account endorsed by him.

123
00:08:26,298 --> 00:08:31,093
One on May 15 for $250.
One on May 22 for $400.

124
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:34,555
That. I...

125
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:37,057
I asked him to do
some shopping for me. That's all.

126
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:39,018
Shelby's a very obliging fellow.

127
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:42,938
For some time, also, you've been
withdrawing various amounts in cash.

128
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:45,149
Sometimes 1,500.

129
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:48,110
Sometimes 1,700 at a clip.

130
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:50,696
Yes. I needed that money.

131
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:57,036
The day you took out $1,500,
Mr. Carpenter deposited 1,350.

132
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,581
When you withdrew 1,700,
he deposited 1,550.

133
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:02,666
Maybe they were shooting crap.

134
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:05,586
Must I be insulted like this?

135
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:11,967
I'm sorry, Mrs. Treadwell, but I have
to find out about these things.

136
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,261
Shelby needed some money,
and I lent it to him.

137
00:09:14,346 --> 00:09:16,722
That's all. After all, it is my money.

138
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:19,166
- I suppose I can do as I please with it.
- Sure. Of course.

139
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:21,977
Now, on Friday night, Mrs. Treadwell,
you stayed home alone all evening?

140
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:23,187
Yes.

141
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:25,147
Why didn't you go to the concert
with Shelby?

142
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:28,150
Because he didn't ask me.

143
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:30,611
We were just talking
about you, Carpenter.

144
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,697
- What a coincidence to find you here.
- This is Lieutenant McPherson.

145
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:35,866
How do you do, Lieutenant?

146
00:09:35,951 --> 00:09:37,826
I didn't know you were here, Mr. Carpenter.

147
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:40,329
As a matter of fact,
I was just lying down here.

148
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:43,999
My hotel room was so hot, and then all
the people and reporters and telephone.

149
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:45,834
You know how it is, Lieutenant.

150
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:48,671
I've hardly slept a wink
since it happened.

151
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:51,423
Is that a sign of guilt or innocence,
McPherson?

152
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:55,135
I'm at your disposal, Lieutenant. I'm as
eager to find the murderer as you are.

153
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:58,138
But what possible motive
could I have for killing Laura?

154
00:09:58,223 --> 00:10:00,623
Miss Hunt and I were going to be married
this week, you know.

155
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:02,977
No, he doesn't know,
and neither do I,

156
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:06,814
- or you or anyone else alive.
- What do you mean by that?

157
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:09,775
Laura had not definitely made up
her mind to marry him.

158
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:13,862
She told me so herself last Friday when she
called up to cancel our dinner engagement.

159
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:17,283
As a matter of fact, she was going
to the country to think it over.

160
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:19,785
She was extremely kind,
but I was always sure

161
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:24,164
she would never have thrown her life
away on a male beauty in distress.

162
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:26,667
I suppose you've heard
losers whine before,

163
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:28,752
especially in your profession?

164
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:30,517
Would you like
a bite of lunch, Lieutenant?

165
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:32,589
That's very thoughtful,
the perfect host.

166
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:33,966
- Waldo.
- You'd almost think

167
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,050
he was in his own home.

168
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:38,554
Shelby knows how distracted I am.
Would you, Lieutenant?

169
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:40,889
Thank you, Mrs. Treadwell,
but I've got to be going.

170
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:44,810
But, Lieutenant. Well, I rather thought
you'd want to ask me some questions.

171
00:10:45,729 --> 00:10:48,147
Yes. What did they play
at the concert Friday night?

172
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:51,025
Brahms's First
and Beethoven's Ninth.

173
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:54,403
Have you got a key
to Miss Hunt's house up in the country?

174
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:57,281
No, but I think there's one
up in her apartment.

175
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:59,908
- Okay, I'll have a look.
- Perhaps I could help you?

176
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:02,328
All right. Come along.

177
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:04,872
I'll be seeing you,
Mrs. Treadwell.

178
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:12,004
Extra! Extra!
Girl victim in brutal slaying!

179
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:14,298
Extra! Girl victim
in brutal slaying!

180
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:16,925
Read all about it!
Girl victim in brutal slaying!

181
00:11:17,052 --> 00:11:19,762
Girl victim
in brutal slaying! Read all about it!

182
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:27,061
All right.
Break it up. Break it up.

183
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:30,105
Ice-cold drinks!

184
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:59,843
- The doorbell rang.
- What?

185
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:03,222
As she opened the door,
the shot was fired.

186
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,432
And how do you deduce that?

187
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:08,769
She fell backward.
The body was there.

188
00:12:09,813 --> 00:12:12,439
I thought you hadn't
been up here before.

189
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,733
I saw the police photos.

190
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,078
I guess I better
try and find that key.

191
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:31,667
McPherson, tell me, why did they have to
photograph her in that horrible condition?

192
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:34,294
When a dame gets killed,
she doesn't worry about how she looks.

193
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:37,464
Will you stop calling her a dame?
Look around.

194
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:40,884
Is this the home of a dame?

195
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:44,638
Look at her.

196
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,352
Not bad.

197
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,522
Jacoby was in love with her
when he painted it,

198
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,858
but he never captured
her vibrance, her warmth.

199
00:12:57,694 --> 00:13:00,112
Have you ever been in love?

200
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:03,198
A doll in Washington Heights
once got a fox fur out of me.

201
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:06,827
Ever know a woman who wasn't
a "doll" or a "dame"?

202
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:12,791
Yeah, one, but she kept walking me
past furniture windows

203
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:14,793
to look at the parlor suites.

204
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:18,755
- Would you mind turning that off?
- Why? Don't you like it?

205
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:22,634
It was one of Laura's favorites.
Not exactly classical, but sweet.

206
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:25,819
- You know a lot about music?
- I don't know a lot about anything,

207
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:27,848
but I know a little
about practically everything.

208
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:29,600
Yeah?

209
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:31,685
Then why did you say
they played Brahms's First

210
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:34,688
and Beethoven's Ninth
at the concert Friday night?

211
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:37,441
They changed the program at the last
minute and played nothing but Sibelius.

212
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:39,902
I suppose I should have
told you in the first place.

213
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:42,696
I'd been working on that
advertising campaign with Laura.

214
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:46,158
Well, we'd been working so hard,
I just couldn't keep my eyes open.

215
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:48,869
I didn't hear a note at the concert.
I fell asleep.

216
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:51,872
Next he'll produce
photographic evidence of his dreams.

217
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:55,042
I know it sounds suspicious,
but I'm resigned to that by now.

218
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:58,587
I'm a natural-born suspect just because
I'm not the conventional type.

219
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:01,131
I wouldn't worry about it,
Mr. Carpenter.

220
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:04,510
It sounds reasonable.
I fall asleep at concerts myself.

221
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:06,178
Thank you.

222
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:09,223
You found that key yet?

223
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:13,018
No. I looked for it in the den,
but it wasn't there. It may be in here.

224
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,694
Yes, here it is.

225
00:14:22,946 --> 00:14:25,405
I knew there must be
one around somewhere.

226
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:28,116
The police are very fussy
about their inventories.

227
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:31,620
That key isn't on the list of things
that were in that drawer yesterday.

228
00:14:32,247 --> 00:14:34,039
Then it's made
a recent reappearance.

229
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:36,667
You put it there, didn't you?

230
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,628
- Yes.
- Why?

231
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:42,339
It's just that I didn't want to give it
to you while Waldo was present.

232
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:45,133
I have private reasons
that don't concern him.

233
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:47,135
Everything about Laura
concerns me.

234
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:51,431
You have private reasons,
no doubt, to lie about the key.

235
00:14:51,516 --> 00:14:54,643
Waldo, for your own good,
I'm warning you to stop implying

236
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:57,020
that I had anything to do
with Laura's death.

237
00:14:57,689 --> 00:14:59,606
Very well. I'll stop implying.

238
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:01,275
I'll make a direct statement.

239
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:02,859
All right, you asked for it.

240
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:04,945
I wouldn't.

241
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:08,865
Will you please stop dawdling
with that infernal puzzle?

242
00:15:08,992 --> 00:15:12,661
- It's getting on my nerves.
- I know, but it keeps me calm.

243
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:14,454
Okay, let's go.

244
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:33,098
This was our table,

245
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:34,850
Laura's and mine.

246
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:38,520
We spent many quiet evenings
here together.

247
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:44,067
I remember we dined here the night
before her 22nd birthday.

248
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:47,487
Just we two,

249
00:15:47,572 --> 00:15:51,366
happy, making plans
for her future.

250
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:53,660
Good luck.

251
00:15:53,745 --> 00:15:55,621
But this was a far cry

252
00:15:55,705 --> 00:16:00,542
from the girl who walked into my life
at the Algonquin Hotel five years before.

253
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:04,212
Pardon me. Excuse me.

254
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:08,467
Excuse me.

255
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:20,562
Mr. Lydecker, how do you do?

256
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:24,191
My name is Laura Hunt,
and I'm with Bullitt and Company.

257
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:26,610
You know,
the big advertising firm.

258
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:29,613
And I'd like to talk
something over with you, if I may.

259
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:33,909
You can hardly fail to realize that
I am engaged in eating my lunch.

260
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:37,788
Yes, I know. I'm awfully sorry
to interrupt this way

261
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:40,957
but it's so hard to get to see you
the regular way, and

262
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:43,043
this will only
take a minute, really.

263
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:48,006
- Now, this is...
- Young woman,

264
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:52,344
either you have been raised
in some incredibly rustic community

265
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,388
where good manners are unknown

266
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:57,099
or you suffer from the common
feminine delusion

267
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:58,934
that the mere fact
of being a woman

268
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:02,104
exempts you from the rules
of civilized conduct.

269
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:04,856
Or possibly both.

270
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:07,818
Possibly, but here's
what I wanted to show you.

271
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:10,028
It's for
the Wallace Flow-Rite pen.

272
00:17:10,113 --> 00:17:14,199
I know my company would be glad to pay
you $5,000 if you'll endorse the ad.

273
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:16,243
I don't use a pen.

274
00:17:16,411 --> 00:17:18,370
I write with a goose quill
dipped in venom.

275
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:21,748
Yes, but this is a very fine pen,
Mr. Lydecker,

276
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:23,458
the best on the market.

277
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:26,503
Wouldn't you at least
consider endorsing it?

278
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:30,549
I'll neither consider, endorse
or use the Wallace pen.

279
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:32,884
I hate pens.

280
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:36,346
If your employers wish me to publish
that statement in my column,

281
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:39,391
you may tell them that I shall be
delighted to oblige.

282
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:43,145
Oh, no. You mustn't do that.

283
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:45,856
Don't blame Bullitt and Company,
Mr. Lydecker.

284
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:49,651
They don't know anything about this.
It was my idea to see you.

285
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:52,487
Indeed?

286
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:56,908
Yes. I know they'd give anything down
at the office to get your endorsement,

287
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:58,869
only they think
there's no use asking.

288
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:02,080
So I had this ad made up
all on my own

289
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:05,625
because I thought, well,
what's the harm in trying?

290
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:08,128
There was always a chance
that you might, Mr. Lydecker.

291
00:18:08,463 --> 00:18:10,005
Just think what
it would mean...

292
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,923
You seem to be completely disregarding

293
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:14,342
something more important
than your career.

294
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:17,053
- What?
- My lunch.

295
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:21,725
Do you really believe that?

296
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:24,394
Implicitly.

297
00:18:24,479 --> 00:18:26,980
I never heard
of anything so selfish.

298
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:31,943
In my case, self-absorption
is completely justified.

299
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:35,322
I have never discovered any other
subject quite so worthy of my attention.

300
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,866
But you write about people

301
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:41,328
with such real understanding
and sentiment.

302
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,915
That's what makes
your column so good.

303
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:48,627
Sentiment comes easily
at 50 cents a word.

304
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:52,214
Well, if that's the way
you really feel,

305
00:18:53,174 --> 00:18:54,966
you must be very lonely.

306
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:59,554
Will you kindly continue
this character analysis elsewhere?

307
00:19:00,431 --> 00:19:03,350
- You begin to bore me.
- You're a poor man.

308
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:06,019
I'm very sorry for you.

309
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:11,691
Naturally,
I was annoyed by the incident,

310
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:14,820
but she had something
about her, that girl.

311
00:19:16,197 --> 00:19:20,283
I had to speak to her again.
I had to see her.

312
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:22,536
- Miss, would you mind if I...
- Just a moment, please.

313
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,996
I'll tell Mr. Bullitt right away.
He's on the telephone.

314
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:27,207
Thank you.

315
00:19:47,979 --> 00:19:51,565
Boy, Waldo Lydecker
to see Miss Laura Hunt.

316
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:54,985
Announce me.

317
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:58,822
Johnny, please tell
the gentleman I'm busy.

318
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:07,414
Miss Hunt, I have something
to say to you.

319
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:09,332
You've already said it,
Mr. Lydecker.

320
00:20:10,084 --> 00:20:13,336
I wish to point out that you caught me
at my most difficult moment.

321
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:16,798
Ordinarily I am not
without a heart.

322
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,508
Really?

323
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:21,136
Shall I produce
X-ray pictures to prove it?

324
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:26,558
I wish to apologize.

325
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:28,685
Your apology is accepted.

326
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:33,148
Good-bye, Mr. Lydecker.

327
00:20:33,316 --> 00:20:35,609
If you come
a little bit closer, my boy,

328
00:20:35,693 --> 00:20:37,902
I can just crack your skull
with my stick.

329
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:46,494
And now, for reasons
which are too embarrassing to mention,

330
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:48,079
I'd like to endorse that pen.

331
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:51,541
Mr. Lydecker!

332
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:53,209
Thank you.

333
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:58,506
- You're a very strange man.
- What?

334
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:02,552
You're really sorry
for the way you acted, aren't you?

335
00:21:03,638 --> 00:21:06,139
Let's not be psychiatric,
Miss Hunt,

336
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:08,850
but in a word, yes.

337
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:12,187
It's very kind of you,
you know.

338
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:15,190
I'm not kind. I'm vicious.
It's the secret of my charm.

339
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:20,779
But if you choose
to think me kind,

340
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:23,698
I'll call for you at 6:00.

341
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:27,619
All right?

342
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:30,080
All right.

343
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:36,961
Her career began
with my endorsement of the pen.

344
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:39,881
I secured other endorsements for her,

345
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:42,342
introduced her
to important clients.

346
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:45,887
I gave her her start

347
00:21:46,097 --> 00:21:48,139
but it was her own talent
and imagination

348
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:51,142
that enabled her to rise
to the top of her profession

349
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:52,602
and stay there.

350
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:56,731
She had an eager mind always.

351
00:21:57,692 --> 00:22:01,236
She was always quick to seize upon
anything that would improve her mind...

352
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:02,987
or her appearance.

353
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:06,908
Laura had innate breeding.

354
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:14,457
But she deferred
to my judgment and taste.

355
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:18,420
I selected a more attractive
hairdress for her.

356
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:24,884
I taught her what clothes
were more becoming to her.

357
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:29,139
Through me, she met everyone.

358
00:22:29,724 --> 00:22:31,766
The famous and the infamous.

359
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:36,896
Her youth and beauty, her poise
and charm of manner...

360
00:22:36,981 --> 00:22:38,356
captivated them all.

361
00:22:39,233 --> 00:22:42,026
She had warmth, vitality.

362
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:45,029
She had authentic magnetism.

363
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:49,284
Wherever we went,
she stood out.

364
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:53,163
Men admired her.
Women envied her.

365
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:57,959
She became as well known
as Waldo Lydecker's walking stick...

366
00:22:58,252 --> 00:22:59,878
and his white carnation.

367
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:02,172
But Tuesday and Friday nights,

368
00:23:02,256 --> 00:23:05,759
we stayed home, dining quietly

369
00:23:05,843 --> 00:23:08,052
listening to my records.

370
00:23:08,429 --> 00:23:10,597
I read my articles to her.

371
00:23:11,474 --> 00:23:14,476
The way she listened
was more eloquent than speech.

372
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:18,646
These were the best nights.

373
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:23,651
Then one Tuesday, she phoned
and said she couldn't come.

374
00:23:25,154 --> 00:23:26,905
It didn't matter, really.

375
00:23:27,782 --> 00:23:30,867
But when it happened again
the following Friday, I was disturbed.

376
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:37,957
I couldn't
understand it. I felt betrayed

377
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:41,127
and yet I knew Laura
would never betray anyone.

378
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:49,844
I walked for a long time.

379
00:23:52,181 --> 00:23:55,350
Then I found myself
before her apartment building.

380
00:23:55,851 --> 00:24:00,104
The lights were on.
It pleased me to know she was home,

381
00:24:00,523 --> 00:24:02,565
till I saw she was not alone.

382
00:24:05,027 --> 00:24:09,239
But I waited.
I wanted to see who he was.

383
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:17,330
It was Jacoby, who had recently
painted her portrait.

384
00:24:17,832 --> 00:24:19,749
I never liked the man.

385
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:24,546
He was so obviously conscious of looking
more like an athlete than an artist.

386
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:27,799
I sat up the rest of the night
writing a column about him.

387
00:24:28,384 --> 00:24:30,093
I demolished his affectations,

388
00:24:30,219 --> 00:24:33,555
exposed his camouflaged
imitations of better painters,

389
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:36,015
ridiculed his theories.

390
00:24:36,392 --> 00:24:39,727
I did it for her,
knowing Jacoby was unworthy of her.

391
00:24:39,854 --> 00:24:43,231
It was a masterpiece
because it was a labor of love.

392
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:46,901
Naturally, she could never
regard him seriously again.

393
00:24:48,404 --> 00:24:51,406
There were others, of course,

394
00:24:51,574 --> 00:24:53,533
but her own discrimination
ruled them out

395
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:56,077
before it became necessary
for me to intercede

396
00:24:58,038 --> 00:25:00,999
until one night at a party
at Ann Treadwell's.

397
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:05,253
It was one of her usual roundups
of bizarre and nondescript characters

398
00:25:05,379 --> 00:25:08,140
- corralled from every stratum of society.
- How are you this evening?

399
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:10,925
This is Mr. and Mrs. Preston.
They've been waiting to meet you.

400
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:12,552
How do you do?

401
00:25:15,598 --> 00:25:17,390
- Hello, Shelby.
- Excuse me, honey.

402
00:25:21,979 --> 00:25:23,771
You're Laura Hunt.

403
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:27,901
- Yes?
- Hello. I'm Shelby Carpenter.

404
00:25:27,985 --> 00:25:31,070
- Want to dance?
- I'm not alone.

405
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:35,742
Oh, him? I'll bet
he's still doing the polka.

406
00:25:35,826 --> 00:25:38,119
Excuse me, please. Yes.

407
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:40,455
Betsy Ross taught it to me.

408
00:25:40,581 --> 00:25:43,082
- Hello, Waldo. Darling, how are you?
- Hello, darling.

409
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:44,542
- I see you've met Shelby.
- Hello, Ann.

410
00:25:44,627 --> 00:25:46,878
- Unavoidably.
- He was awfully nice to me in Louisville

411
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:49,297
at the Derby. His family's from Kentucky.

412
00:25:50,132 --> 00:25:52,050
Sharecroppers, no doubt.

413
00:25:57,139 --> 00:26:00,266
Louise. Louise, for the last time,
will you marry me?

414
00:26:00,351 --> 00:26:02,518
I won't, but I've saved
some chicken livers for you.

415
00:26:02,603 --> 00:26:04,646
You're an angel.
In the meantime, darling,

416
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:06,814
you think you could
get this spot out for me?

417
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:09,609
I can afford a blemish on my character
but not on my clothes.

418
00:26:10,152 --> 00:26:12,612
- Couldn't eat another mouthful.
- I'm afraid it's rouge.

419
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:14,697
- I'm afraid it's liquor.
- Louise.

420
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:16,699
May I have a glass of
milk for Mr. Lydecker?

421
00:26:16,784 --> 00:26:17,784
Of course, Miss Hunt.

422
00:26:17,868 --> 00:26:19,744
I forgot to tell you.
I also read palms.

423
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:24,040
I cook, I swallow swords, I mend my own
socks, I never eat garlic or onions.

424
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:25,917
What more can you want
of a man?

425
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:29,087
- Don't listen to that scalawag.
- I didn't expect to find him here, Louise.

426
00:26:29,171 --> 00:26:30,880
What do you mean?
We're old friends.

427
00:26:30,965 --> 00:26:32,757
She feeds me,
humors me, repairs me

428
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:34,926
and refuses to marry me,
don't you, honey?

429
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,928
- I do.
- She has good sense.

430
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:39,597
- Now, wait just a minute. Thanks, Louise.
- You're wasting your time.

431
00:26:39,682 --> 00:26:41,975
- She's got good sense too.
- You're jealous.

432
00:26:44,353 --> 00:26:46,646
And what does it feel like,
Mr. Carpenter?

433
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:49,565
What does what feel like,
Miss Hunt?

434
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:52,151
Living on the income
from an estate.

435
00:26:52,486 --> 00:26:54,404
- Well, I...
- Or don't you know?

436
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:58,074
Well, I did, until the sheriff
took it over 10 years ago.

437
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:01,035
Why maintain the fiction?
Why not work?

438
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,288
Believe it or not, I asked
one of my many friends for a job once,

439
00:27:04,373 --> 00:27:07,458
executive of a big company,
2,500 employees.

440
00:27:07,543 --> 00:27:09,794
He could have pressed a button
and done it, but he just laughed.

441
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:11,963
- He thought I was joking.
- Weren't you?

442
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:15,091
No. When I convinced him, he got
embarrassed, said he'd phone me.

443
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:19,303
That was months ago. Now whenever
he sees me, he looks the other way.

444
00:27:27,521 --> 00:27:30,148
- Do you really want a job?
- Yes.

445
00:27:33,235 --> 00:27:35,236
Here you are.

446
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,614
Laura, dear, I cannot stand
these morons any longer.

447
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:41,868
If you don't come with me
this instant, I shall run amok.

448
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:44,412
All right, Waldo.

449
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:48,124
10:30 tomorrow,
Bullitt and Company.

450
00:27:49,251 --> 00:27:50,793
You've got a job.

451
00:27:51,712 --> 00:27:55,339
I concealed my
annoyance with masterly self-control,

452
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:59,761
but I sensed a situation
which would bear watching.

453
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:03,014
Laura, take a look at this.

454
00:28:04,266 --> 00:28:07,769
Do you like it? Do you think it'll make
people want to bathe more often?

455
00:28:08,145 --> 00:28:10,521
It should. It's excellent.

456
00:28:10,898 --> 00:28:13,024
- There you are.
- Good night, Miss Hunt.

457
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:14,192
- Good night.
- Good night, Mr. Carpenter.

458
00:28:14,276 --> 00:28:17,361
- Good night, honey.
- It's really very good. Who's the model?

459
00:28:17,446 --> 00:28:20,323
A girl named Diane Redfern.
You hired her yourself last week.

460
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:21,783
- Don't you remember?
- Oh, yeah.

461
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:24,869
Well, let's go, moon of my delight.
I am starved.

462
00:28:25,329 --> 00:28:26,788
You usually are.

463
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:29,624
- I approve of that hat.
- You do?

464
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:31,834
And the girl in it too.

465
00:28:32,503 --> 00:28:34,087
Thank you.

466
00:28:37,633 --> 00:28:39,467
I knew there was
something on my mind.

467
00:28:39,593 --> 00:28:42,887
What is it? Oh, yes.
Will you dine with me tomorrow night?

468
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:45,556
- Maybe.
- No, that isn't what's worrying me.

469
00:28:45,641 --> 00:28:47,641
- It's the next night.
- But, Shelby, I can't be...

470
00:28:47,643 --> 00:28:51,229
Good. What about three weeks from
tonight and all the nights in between?

471
00:28:51,313 --> 00:28:52,897
Don't you think
I have any other engagements?

472
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:56,234
What about two months
from now and the month after that?

473
00:28:56,318 --> 00:28:59,529
- What about next year?
- That's all settled. What about breakfast?

474
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:02,323
What about dancing?

475
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:04,325
What about lunch?
Beautiful lunches

476
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:07,245
- day after day after day after day?
- What about work?

477
00:29:07,329 --> 00:29:10,456
Beautiful work,
day after day after day?

478
00:29:10,541 --> 00:29:12,250
Why, Miss Hunt,
the way you talk.

479
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:14,377
You'd think I was in love with you.

480
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:22,510
Yes, Laura,
I heard everything he said.

481
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:27,557
I went to call for you.

482
00:29:29,393 --> 00:29:30,852
I'm sorry, Waldo.

483
00:29:31,645 --> 00:29:33,521
And that reminds me.

484
00:29:35,983 --> 00:29:38,693
Old Mother Hubbard has
something in the cupboard.

485
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:43,114
The results of
my private investigation

486
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:45,700
of that sterling character,
Mr. Shelby Carpenter.

487
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:50,246
By stooping so low, you only
degrade yourself, Waldo.

488
00:29:51,999 --> 00:29:55,585
Did you know that he almost went to jail
for passing rubber checks,

489
00:29:55,669 --> 00:29:58,129
that he was suspected of stealing
his hostess's jewels

490
00:29:58,213 --> 00:30:00,131
when he was a house-guest
in Virginia?

491
00:30:00,257 --> 00:30:02,925
Naturally they'd suspect him,
because he isn't rich.

492
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:06,137
Those are only insinuations,

493
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:08,389
the cheapest kind.

494
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:11,100
These aren't only
insinuations, my dear.

495
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:13,227
There you are. Read them.

496
00:30:15,105 --> 00:30:17,148
What of it?

497
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:21,277
I know his faults.
A man can change, can't he?

498
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:24,405
People are always ready
to hold out a hand to slap you down,

499
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:26,407
but never to pick you up.

500
00:30:26,867 --> 00:30:28,576
All right, I'm helping Shelby.

501
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,745
His past is his own affair.

502
00:30:30,871 --> 00:30:33,664
I only care about the present.

503
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:37,126
Speaking of the changed Mr. Carpenter
in the present tense,

504
00:30:38,587 --> 00:30:41,380
he's now running around
with a model from your own office.

505
00:30:41,465 --> 00:30:43,716
Her name is Diane Redfern.

506
00:30:45,886 --> 00:30:49,222
I'm closer to despising you
than I thought I ever would be.

507
00:30:55,938 --> 00:30:59,148
I'm sorry. I should have
told you before.

508
00:30:59,733 --> 00:31:02,318
Shelby and I are going to be
married next week.

509
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:09,784
I believe you presented him with
a cigarette case on his last birthday.

510
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:15,665
Rather valuable, isn't it?

511
00:31:15,749 --> 00:31:17,291
Where did you get it?

512
00:31:17,501 --> 00:31:20,419
From the pawnshop where Diane Redfern
took it after he gave it to her.

513
00:31:21,046 --> 00:31:24,465
I don't believe it. He probably needed
money and was too proud to borrow.

514
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:26,092
Carpenter proud?

515
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:30,304
Perhaps that's why
the pawn ticket was in her name.

516
00:31:30,472 --> 00:31:32,313
Before this goes any further,
why, I'll just...

517
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:36,060
He isn't home.

518
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:46,153
He's dining at Ann Treadwell's.

519
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:48,447
He can't be.
He asked me to dinner.

520
00:31:48,657 --> 00:31:52,243
He would have canceled his appointment
with her if you had accepted.

521
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:54,120
He treats her
rather badly these days.

522
00:31:56,999 --> 00:31:59,125
I'm afraid she'll say
he isn't there.

523
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:10,636
Waldo,

524
00:32:11,847 --> 00:32:13,472
why are you doing this?

525
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:20,896
For you, Laura.

526
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:24,525
Shall we pay them a visit?

527
00:32:25,861 --> 00:32:29,405
He won't be there, Waldo.
I know he won't.

528
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:31,949
All right. We'll see.

529
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:37,204
Don't you want to take this little
bauble along in case he is there?

530
00:32:46,548 --> 00:32:47,748
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

531
00:32:47,841 --> 00:32:50,676
- I'm sorry. Mrs. Treadwell is not home.
- We know, dear.

532
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:05,066
Good evening.

533
00:33:10,447 --> 00:33:13,449
Hello, darling. I didn't expect
to see you tonight.

534
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:15,076
There you are, my dear.

535
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:18,162
In a moment of supreme disaster,
he's trite.

536
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:21,082
You've been reading
too many melodramas, Waldo.

537
00:33:21,792 --> 00:33:24,168
I was just telling Ann
about our getting married.

538
00:33:25,045 --> 00:33:26,796
Well, have you two had dinner?

539
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:29,298
Would you like a glass of wine?

540
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:31,008
Why don't you sit down?

541
00:33:40,185 --> 00:33:44,021
I couldn't find out
if she saw Carpenter in the meantime.

542
00:33:44,231 --> 00:33:47,775
All I know is that on Friday
she had lunch with Diane Redfern.

543
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:51,987
What came
of it, I hoped to hear that night.

544
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:53,572
I alternated between moods of

545
00:33:53,657 --> 00:33:55,533
overoptimism and over-pessimism.

546
00:33:55,617 --> 00:33:58,119
When the phone rang,
I had a foreboding of disaster.

547
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:05,584
I called to tell you, Waldo,
I'm frightfully sorry.

548
00:34:05,669 --> 00:34:08,045
I can't have dinner
with you tonight.

549
00:34:08,255 --> 00:34:11,674
Oh, no, no. I'm not sick.
I'm just dreadfully nervous.

550
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:14,343
I'm going to the country
for a few days.

551
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:16,512
Yes. I'm afraid
it's about Shelby.

552
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:19,765
Oh, no. Please.
There's nothing you can do.

553
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:22,351
I've got to think
this thing out for myself.

554
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:26,647
I'm sorry. I'll call you
when I get back. Good-bye.

555
00:34:28,233 --> 00:34:30,609
It was the last time
I ever heard her voice.

556
00:34:32,154 --> 00:34:34,905
I was sure she had
too much pride to forgive him.

557
00:34:36,658 --> 00:34:38,159
But...

558
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:41,495
Where does
this Diane Redfern live?

559
00:34:42,164 --> 00:34:44,540
Brooklyn somewhere.
She's in the phone book.

560
00:34:46,835 --> 00:34:48,836
Come on. It's late.
Let's get going.

561
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:51,839
- Waiter.
- Yes, sir.

562
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:57,011
- All right.
- Thank you, Mr. Lydecker.

563
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:03,017
Good night.

564
00:35:07,147 --> 00:35:10,357
I shall never forgive myself for
letting her become involved with Shelby.

565
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:13,027
It was my fault.

566
00:35:13,987 --> 00:35:16,030
I should have
stopped it somehow.

567
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:18,365
Well, it's too late now.

568
00:35:22,579 --> 00:35:24,246
Thanks for the wine.

569
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:45,184
Hello. Mosconi's?

570
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:48,521
This is Lieutenant McPherson,
Homicide Bureau.

571
00:35:48,605 --> 00:35:52,691
Laura Hunt had been buying her liquor
from you for several years, hadn't she?

572
00:35:52,776 --> 00:35:54,985
Yeah.

573
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:58,364
Did she ever buy a brand of scotch
called Black Pony?

574
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:01,909
Yeah.

575
00:36:03,078 --> 00:36:05,704
I see.

576
00:36:05,789 --> 00:36:07,915
Well, that's all
I wanted to know. Thanks.

577
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,917
She's here, McPherson,
the maid.

578
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:12,461
Okay.

579
00:36:12,546 --> 00:36:15,297
- Come in, Miss Clary.
- Never mind the "Miss Clary" stuff.

580
00:36:15,382 --> 00:36:19,218
My name's Bessie, and I'm a domestic,
and I got nothin' to be ashamed of.

581
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:21,387
Sit down, Bessie.

582
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:24,390
Her letters.

583
00:36:24,683 --> 00:36:26,600
And her private diary.

584
00:36:27,769 --> 00:36:30,104
You've been reading them,
pawing over them.

585
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:33,107
It's a shame in the face of the dead.
That's what it is. It's a shame.

586
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:36,026
- Sit down, Bessie.
- I'll stand on my own two feet.

587
00:36:36,111 --> 00:36:38,195
Don't you go
ordering me around.

588
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:42,825
I ain't afraid of cops. I was
brought up to spit whenever I saw one.

589
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:46,745
Okay, go ahead and spit
if that'll make you feel better.

590
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:54,753
What do you want to know?

591
00:36:54,838 --> 00:36:57,172
What we all want to know,
who killed Laura Hunt.

592
00:36:57,257 --> 00:36:58,924
How would I know?

593
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:02,386
You don't think I done it?

594
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:05,931
I know you cops
get crazy notions,

595
00:37:06,016 --> 00:37:08,392
but if you got any notion
concerning me...

596
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:11,895
Ask anyone,
anyone who ever come to this house.

597
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:13,897
I would have worked for her.

598
00:37:13,982 --> 00:37:15,899
I would have washed,
ironed, scrubbed,

599
00:37:15,984 --> 00:37:19,695
done everything she wanted of me,
whether she paid me for it or not.

600
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:23,741
And it wasn't only on account of the
thousand sweet things she done for me.

601
00:37:23,825 --> 00:37:26,368
It was because she was
so sweet herself,

602
00:37:26,453 --> 00:37:29,330
because she was
a real fine lady.

603
00:37:30,832 --> 00:37:34,668
But you cops
wouldn't know about that.

604
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:40,257
But you do. That's all the more reason
why you should help me, Bessie.

605
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:43,427
Do you happen to know how this got into
her liquor cabinet?

606
00:37:44,846 --> 00:37:46,847
I put it there.

607
00:37:47,015 --> 00:37:50,351
But she never bought cheap stuff like
that, not a lady like Miss Hunt.

608
00:37:50,435 --> 00:37:53,437
- No.
- When did you put it in the cabinet?

609
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:55,439
- Saturday.
- Before the police came.

610
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:59,026
- Was it there Friday night before you left?
- No.

611
00:37:59,152 --> 00:38:01,236
Are you sure of that?

612
00:38:01,446 --> 00:38:04,114
I cleaned out
the cabinet on Friday

613
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:06,200
and put the empties
in the basement.

614
00:38:07,452 --> 00:38:09,953
Then somebody was with her
in the apartment Friday night,

615
00:38:10,038 --> 00:38:11,955
someone
who brought that bottle.

616
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,749
- Yes.
- Who?

617
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:16,377
I don't know,
but I didn't want anyone

618
00:38:16,461 --> 00:38:19,755
getting any wrong ideas about her,
God rest her soul.

619
00:38:20,507 --> 00:38:22,841
That's why I took it out of the bedroom
and put it in the cabinet

620
00:38:22,926 --> 00:38:24,885
before the police got here.

621
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:27,471
And that ain't all I done.

622
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:30,641
I washed out the glasses
and cleaned off the bottle too.

623
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:32,768
Do you know what happens to people
who destroy evidence?

624
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:34,228
I don't care.

625
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,357
You ain't gonna tell
the newspaper reporters, are ya,

626
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:40,401
and let them make up
their nasty stories

627
00:38:40,527 --> 00:38:42,111
and drag her name
through the mud?

628
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:46,031
Go ahead,
but it won't do you any good.

629
00:38:46,116 --> 00:38:48,992
- I'll say you lied. I'll say...
- Take it easy, Bessie.

630
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:52,413
Get me some ice
and a setup, will you?

631
00:38:52,539 --> 00:38:54,581
All right.

632
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:56,750
A couple of highball glasses.

633
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:03,590
Good morning.
Lieutenant McPherson sent for us.

634
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:05,592
- Good morning, Lieutenant.
- Hello, McPherson.

635
00:39:05,677 --> 00:39:07,845
This is quite a delegation.
I only sent for you, Carpenter.

636
00:39:07,929 --> 00:39:09,096
- I know.
- Shelby's dropping me off

637
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,347
at the hairdresser's later,

638
00:39:10,432 --> 00:39:13,726
- so I thought I might as well come along.
- My excuse is equally feeble.

639
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:16,228
I just popped in
to pay my dubious respects

640
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:18,313
and inquire as to
the state of your health.

641
00:39:18,857 --> 00:39:21,024
- Insipid, I trust.
- I was just going to pour myself a drink.

642
00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:23,360
- Care to join me?
- A very nice idea.

643
00:39:23,445 --> 00:39:24,645
Shelby, wouldn't you like one?

644
00:39:24,654 --> 00:39:26,155
- I'll get it.
- Never mind.

645
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:27,781
Bessie, would you bring
a couple more glasses?

646
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:29,575
- Yes, sir.
- Hi, Bessie.

647
00:39:29,659 --> 00:39:30,951
What are you doing here?

648
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:33,537
I'm paid up for the week,
and I'm working, regardless.

649
00:39:33,705 --> 00:39:36,874
- Would you like one, Lydecker?
- I see no reason to exclude myself

650
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:38,417
if the host provides scotch.

651
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:40,878
- This do?
- I presume it'll have to.

652
00:39:40,962 --> 00:39:43,130
How about you, Carpenter?
It's cheap, but it's potent.

653
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:46,800
As a matter of fact, I don't think I care
for any. I'm not much of a daytime drinker.

654
00:39:46,885 --> 00:39:49,428
That'll be all for you,
Bessie. You can go home now.

655
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:51,180
But I... Yes, sir.

656
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:54,850
I remember when Laura
bought these glasses.

657
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:57,227
She loved them.
She loved all her things so.

658
00:39:57,645 --> 00:40:00,063
What are you going to do?
Sell them?

659
00:40:00,148 --> 00:40:03,066
I don't know.
I suppose so. Thank you.

660
00:40:03,151 --> 00:40:04,526
If I'm appointed
administrator of the estate,

661
00:40:04,611 --> 00:40:06,945
I shall probably just call in Corey.

662
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:09,114
You mean Lancaster Corey,
the art dealer?

663
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:11,283
Yes. He was
a friend of Laura's.

664
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:14,536
Let him dispose of everything.
It'll be less gruesome that way.

665
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:17,706
Not quite everything, Ann.

666
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:20,042
Two or three things in here
belong to me.

667
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:22,669
This vase, for instance,

668
00:40:23,338 --> 00:40:25,506
and that clock, of course,

669
00:40:26,466 --> 00:40:28,217
and the antique fire screen.

670
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:30,844
- I only lent them to Laura, you know.
- Oh, really, Waldo.

671
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:35,307
Yes, really. This vase is the gem of my
collection. I intend to have it back.

672
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:36,600
And the clock and the screen too.

673
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:39,686
But they aren't yours. You gave them
to Laura. I won't permit it.

674
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:42,356
Does an alleged fiancé
have any voice in this matter?

675
00:40:43,191 --> 00:40:44,608
I'll take the vase with me now

676
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:48,195
and send someone to collect
the other things this very day.

677
00:40:48,947 --> 00:40:51,490
Nothing is leaving here
except you, Lydecker.

678
00:40:52,075 --> 00:40:54,910
Is that your quaint way
of indicating dismissal?

679
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:58,705
We're all going anyway. I have to be
back at headquarters by noon.

680
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:02,543
Lieutenant, I don't understand.
You sent for me, didn't you?

681
00:41:02,752 --> 00:41:04,419
- Yeah.
- Well, don't you want to see me?

682
00:41:04,546 --> 00:41:07,214
- Don't you want to ask me some questions?
- I'll be seeing you.

683
00:41:07,382 --> 00:41:09,132
- Well...
- I bid you good day.

684
00:41:09,259 --> 00:41:10,425
Come along, Shelby.

685
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:13,053
Are you making any progress
on the case, Lieutenant?

686
00:41:14,973 --> 00:41:16,431
We're doing all right.

687
00:41:32,824 --> 00:41:35,617
- Hello, Mark.
- Go get something to eat. I'll take over.

688
00:41:35,702 --> 00:41:37,327
- Thanks.
- Take your time.

689
00:44:37,216 --> 00:44:38,842
Fred?

690
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:46,266
- Yes?
- What's the matter? Did you go to sleep?

691
00:44:46,768 --> 00:44:49,227
This is McPherson.
Any calls come through?

692
00:44:50,855 --> 00:44:52,481
Well, keep listening.

693
00:44:52,857 --> 00:44:54,566
No. Nothing new.

694
00:45:01,282 --> 00:45:03,116
I happened to see
the lights on.

695
00:45:04,786 --> 00:45:06,495
Have you sublet this apartment?

696
00:45:06,579 --> 00:45:08,538
You're here often enough
to pay rent.

697
00:45:08,748 --> 00:45:11,124
- Any objections?
- Yes.

698
00:45:12,043 --> 00:45:14,044
I object to you prying
into Laura's letters,

699
00:45:14,212 --> 00:45:15,796
especially those from me.

700
00:45:16,047 --> 00:45:19,049
- Why? Yours are the best in the bunch.
- Thanks.

701
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:20,967
But I didn't write them to you.

702
00:45:21,844 --> 00:45:24,262
Haven't you any sense
of privacy?

703
00:45:25,223 --> 00:45:28,058
Murder victims have
no claim to privacy.

704
00:45:28,476 --> 00:45:32,020
Have detectives who buy portraits
of murder victims a claim to privacy?

705
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:37,234
Lancaster Corey told me
that you've already put in a bid for it.

706
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:39,528
That's none of your business.

707
00:45:39,904 --> 00:45:43,365
McPherson, did it ever strike you
that you're acting very strangely?

708
00:45:43,825 --> 00:45:47,369
It's a wonder you don't come here like a
suitor, with roses and a box of candy,

709
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:49,579
drugstore candy, of course.

710
00:45:50,623 --> 00:45:53,083
Have you ever dreamed
of Laura as your wife,

711
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:56,586
by your side at the policeman's ball,
or in the bleachers,

712
00:45:56,671 --> 00:45:59,673
or listening to the heroic story of how
you got a silver shinbone

713
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:01,299
from a gun battle
with a gangster?

714
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:06,304
- I see you have.
- Why don't you go home? I'm busy.

715
00:46:08,349 --> 00:46:10,100
Perhaps we can
come to terms now.

716
00:46:11,686 --> 00:46:14,980
You want the portrait.
Perfectly understandable.

717
00:46:15,064 --> 00:46:18,483
I want my possessions,
my vase, my clock and my screen.

718
00:46:18,568 --> 00:46:20,902
Also perfectly understandable.
Now, if you...

719
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:22,571
Get going.

720
00:46:22,864 --> 00:46:26,366
You better watch out, McPherson,
or you'll end up in a psychiatric ward.

721
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:31,371
I don't think they've ever had a patient
who fell in love with a corpse.

722
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:03,630
What are you doing here?

723
00:48:06,968 --> 00:48:08,301
You're alive.

724
00:48:09,262 --> 00:48:11,638
If you don't get out at once,
I'm going to call the police.

725
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:13,765
You are Laura Hunt, aren't you?

726
00:48:16,852 --> 00:48:18,270
Aren't you?

727
00:48:18,396 --> 00:48:21,022
- I'm going to call the police.
- Well, I am the police.

728
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:23,692
Mark McPherson.

729
00:48:25,653 --> 00:48:27,195
What's this all about?

730
00:48:28,823 --> 00:48:30,240
Don't you know?

731
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:32,325
- Don't you know what's happened?
- No.

732
00:48:33,995 --> 00:48:36,371
Haven't you seen the papers?
Where have you been?

733
00:48:37,665 --> 00:48:40,583
Up in the country.
I don't get a newspaper.

734
00:48:41,502 --> 00:48:45,005
- Haven't you got a radio?
- It was broken.

735
00:48:45,214 --> 00:48:46,673
What...

736
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:07,736
Somebody was murdered
in this room.

737
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:09,863
Do you have any idea
who it was?

738
00:49:10,156 --> 00:49:11,865
No.

739
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:14,117
Who had a key
to your apartment?

740
00:49:14,702 --> 00:49:16,745
Nobody.

741
00:49:16,871 --> 00:49:18,830
Are you sure?

742
00:49:19,582 --> 00:49:22,334
- When did it happen?
- Friday night.

743
00:49:26,255 --> 00:49:28,048
What are you going to do now?

744
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:30,550
Find out who was murdered

745
00:49:30,676 --> 00:49:32,719
and then find the murderer.

746
00:49:36,474 --> 00:49:39,476
You'd better take off those wet clothes.
You might catch cold.

747
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:46,191
Yeah.

748
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:57,660
I found this in my closet.

749
00:49:57,745 --> 00:49:59,662
It's Diane Redfern's.

750
00:49:59,747 --> 00:50:02,624
It wasn't here when I left.
She's one of our models.

751
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,417
Just about my size.

752
00:50:07,129 --> 00:50:08,755
Beautiful, wasn't she?

753
00:50:09,090 --> 00:50:10,632
Do you suppose...

754
00:50:14,804 --> 00:50:16,596
Sit down, please.

755
00:50:20,935 --> 00:50:23,603
This is Monday night.
You left on Friday.

756
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:27,399
- Rather a long weekend, isn't it?
- Yes.

757
00:50:27,775 --> 00:50:29,442
What train did you take?

758
00:50:30,069 --> 00:50:31,611
The 7:26.

759
00:50:31,946 --> 00:50:34,447
- See anybody you knew on the train?
- No.

760
00:50:35,116 --> 00:50:38,701
- Then what?
- Then I got off the train at Norwalk.

761
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:41,204
Saw nobody you knew
at the station either?

762
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:42,580
No.

763
00:50:43,082 --> 00:50:44,416
Go on.

764
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:47,293
Then I went to the garage
where I keep my car.

765
00:50:47,461 --> 00:50:51,172
It's a private garage.
Nobody saw me there either.

766
00:50:51,841 --> 00:50:53,133
Then I drove to my house.

767
00:50:54,009 --> 00:50:55,885
You were there three days.
What did you do?

768
00:50:56,387 --> 00:50:58,012
Work in my garden.

769
00:50:59,265 --> 00:51:00,890
You didn't go out
in all that time?

770
00:51:01,308 --> 00:51:04,060
No. I had everything
I needed in the house.

771
00:51:04,812 --> 00:51:07,272
- Nobody came to see you?
- Nobody.

772
00:51:07,565 --> 00:51:09,065
I went there to be alone.

773
00:51:10,109 --> 00:51:12,509
Police were there on Saturday.
There was no one in the house.

774
00:51:13,821 --> 00:51:16,781
Oh, yes. Saturday,
I took a long walk.

775
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:19,159
I walked for hours
in the woods.

776
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:24,330
You were going to
marry Shelby Carpenter this week.

777
00:51:24,707 --> 00:51:26,166
Thursday, if I'm not mistaken.

778
00:51:29,170 --> 00:51:30,462
Yes.

779
00:51:30,963 --> 00:51:33,214
Yet you went away
just before your wedding,

780
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:35,633
for a long weekend to be alone.

781
00:51:36,469 --> 00:51:38,928
I was tired.
I'd been working hard.

782
00:51:39,013 --> 00:51:42,265
You know Shelby Carpenter has a key to
this apartment. Why didn't you tell me?

783
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:44,601
I know nothing of the sort.
He hasn't.

784
00:51:44,685 --> 00:51:46,686
How else did the girl
get into the apartment?

785
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:50,482
You knew she was in love with Carpenter,
that he'd given her your cigarette case.

786
00:51:50,566 --> 00:51:51,983
You know all that, don't you?

787
00:51:52,151 --> 00:51:54,944
I knew that she was in love with him.
She told me so herself.

788
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:58,281
- When did she tell you?
- At lunch last Friday.

789
00:51:58,365 --> 00:52:01,951
I also know she meant nothing to Shelby.
I understand him better than you do.

790
00:52:02,036 --> 00:52:04,370
She was found in your
dressing gown and slippers.

791
00:52:04,455 --> 00:52:06,915
That's hardly the regulation costume
for an impersonal chat

792
00:52:06,999 --> 00:52:09,542
between a man and woman
who mean nothing to each other.

793
00:52:09,835 --> 00:52:12,835
Did you know or did you suspect he was
going to bring her here Friday night?

794
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:15,548
How could I? I don't know that he
brought her here. Neither do you.

795
00:52:15,674 --> 00:52:18,134
- You merely assume it.
- What other assumption is possible?

796
00:52:18,219 --> 00:52:21,554
Do you love Carpenter so much you'd risk
your own safety to protect him?

797
00:52:21,639 --> 00:52:24,474
My own safety?
Do you suspect me?

798
00:52:24,642 --> 00:52:27,894
I suspect nobody and everybody.
I'm merely trying to get at the truth.

799
00:52:28,103 --> 00:52:30,313
I see you have been trying
to get at the truth.

800
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:33,191
You've read things I never meant
anyone else to look at.

801
00:52:33,651 --> 00:52:35,109
Strictly routine.

802
00:52:35,236 --> 00:52:36,986
I'm sorry. Really.

803
00:52:40,616 --> 00:52:43,243
I'd better be going. I'll see you
in the morning, Miss Hunt.

804
00:52:43,536 --> 00:52:46,829
I must ask you not to leave
the house or use the phone.

805
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:50,250
But... But I've got
to let my friends know I'm alive.

806
00:52:50,668 --> 00:52:53,127
Sorry, Miss Hunt,
but I must insist you do as I say.

807
00:52:53,254 --> 00:52:55,547
- Am I under arrest?
- No.

808
00:52:56,257 --> 00:52:59,842
But if anything should happen
to you this time, I wouldn't like it.

809
00:53:01,262 --> 00:53:02,929
All right. I promise.

810
00:53:03,055 --> 00:53:06,015
There's one more thing.
You may as well know what I know,

811
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:07,725
some of it, at any rate.

812
00:53:07,810 --> 00:53:10,353
It'll save time and a lot
of unnecessary fencing.

813
00:53:11,564 --> 00:53:14,274
I know that you went away
to make up your mind

814
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:20,697
whether you'd marry
Shelby Carpenter or not.

815
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:24,742
What did you decide?
I want the truth.

816
00:53:26,912 --> 00:53:28,580
I decided not to marry him.

817
00:53:30,332 --> 00:53:32,500
I'll see you in the morning.
Good night.

818
00:53:32,751 --> 00:53:34,210
Good night.

819
00:53:48,851 --> 00:53:51,978
Really?
Does McPherson know that?

820
00:53:52,313 --> 00:53:55,023
Well, okay. Good-bye.

821
00:53:56,442 --> 00:53:58,943
Say, Mark, that was
the medical examiner's report.

822
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:02,405
It wasn't Laura Hunt. It was Diane
Redfern that was bumped off upstairs.

823
00:54:02,573 --> 00:54:05,241
- Kinda balls things up, doesn't it?
- Yeah.

824
00:54:05,326 --> 00:54:07,368
Say, you're not taking it too hard.

825
00:54:07,453 --> 00:54:09,829
Wait a minute.

826
00:54:10,164 --> 00:54:12,582
- Hello?
- This is Laura. I've...

827
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:14,500
Don't say anything on the phone.
Meet me right away.

828
00:54:14,627 --> 00:54:16,628
I'll wait for you in my car
in front of Bullitt's.

829
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:19,505
- Was that...
- Yeah.

830
00:54:19,965 --> 00:54:21,758
Dames are always
pulling a switch on you.

831
00:54:22,301 --> 00:54:23,635
Stand by.

832
00:54:41,695 --> 00:54:43,571
You follow her.
I'm gonna tail him.

833
00:55:36,083 --> 00:55:38,292
Are you taking it down
or putting it away, Carpenter?

834
00:55:51,849 --> 00:55:54,600
- It's been fired lately.
- Yes. I killed some rabbits with it.

835
00:55:54,768 --> 00:55:57,520
- When?
- A while back. I don't know exactly.

836
00:55:57,604 --> 00:55:59,355
You know about guns, don't you?

837
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:02,275
- Yes.
- How come you didn't clean it afterward?

838
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:05,111
I don't know.
I forgot, I suppose.

839
00:56:05,362 --> 00:56:08,698
- Your initials?
- Yes. I gave it to Laura for protection.

840
00:56:08,991 --> 00:56:11,033
She didn't want it,
but I insisted.

841
00:56:11,452 --> 00:56:13,911
This house is rather isolated,
as you see.

842
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:16,539
- Did you teach her how to use it?
- No.

843
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:20,293
- Does she know how?
- I don't know. It didn't occur to me to ask.

844
00:56:20,502 --> 00:56:22,670
You're a vague sort of a fellow,
aren't you, Carpenter?

845
00:56:22,796 --> 00:56:26,257
I've spent very little time in observing
my own character, Mr. McPherson.

846
00:56:26,341 --> 00:56:29,102
You haven't borrowed it lately?
You didn't just bring it back tonight?

847
00:56:29,136 --> 00:56:32,180
You followed me here.
You saw me come in. You ought to know.

848
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:35,975
You realize
the spot you're in, Carpenter?

849
00:56:36,977 --> 00:56:38,978
You took that poor girl
to Miss Hunt's apartment.

850
00:56:39,062 --> 00:56:41,439
You knew all along
it was she who was murdered.

851
00:56:43,317 --> 00:56:46,694
Didn't you know Laura Hunt would come
back any day and spill the whole thing?

852
00:56:48,655 --> 00:56:50,364
Or did you plan
to kill her too,

853
00:56:50,449 --> 00:56:53,493
hide the body someplace
and cover up your first crime?

854
00:56:53,577 --> 00:56:55,369
You're being fantastic,
McPherson.

855
00:56:57,164 --> 00:56:59,665
You took a bottle of Black Pony
to her house Friday night.

856
00:57:00,042 --> 00:57:01,959
I took it there
over a week ago.

857
00:57:02,169 --> 00:57:05,254
Bessie said it wasn't there Friday
night. It was Saturday morning.

858
00:57:05,339 --> 00:57:06,923
I can't help what Bessie said.

859
00:57:10,177 --> 00:57:13,137
- Where's the key to her apartment?
- I haven't got it.

860
00:57:13,222 --> 00:57:15,681
What did you do with it,
give it back to her tonight?

861
00:57:16,934 --> 00:57:17,934
I never had one.

862
00:57:18,227 --> 00:57:20,895
You didn't take the bottle
of scotch to her house Friday night.

863
00:57:20,979 --> 00:57:23,105
You haven't got a key to her apartment.
How did you get in?

864
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:24,910
- Well, I...
- You had a key, and I know it.

865
00:57:24,942 --> 00:57:27,360
- Now, come on, Carpenter. Spill it.
- I...

866
00:57:28,987 --> 00:57:32,073
Laura kept a duplicate key
at her office. I went over and got it.

867
00:57:32,533 --> 00:57:36,327
I'd asked Diane to dine with me. I wanted
to have it out with her once and for all.

868
00:57:36,578 --> 00:57:40,540
You know, she thought... Well,
she thought she was in love with me.

869
00:57:41,041 --> 00:57:44,293
Well, we couldn't go on talking
in public places. She was too upset.

870
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:47,182
I couldn't go to her room, and I didn't
want to take her to my hotel.

871
00:57:47,256 --> 00:57:49,298
- So we went to Laura's.
- Yeah?

872
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:51,592
We talked there
for about three hours,

873
00:57:52,094 --> 00:57:54,929
- and then the doorbell rang and...
- Go on.

874
00:57:55,389 --> 00:57:58,099
Diane was frightened.
But knowing Laura as I've known her,

875
00:57:58,183 --> 00:58:00,142
I've learned to be
surprised at nothing.

876
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:01,644
What do you mean by that?

877
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:03,396
Her friends would come to her
with their troubles

878
00:58:03,522 --> 00:58:05,731
at all hours
of the day or night.

879
00:58:05,816 --> 00:58:08,234
I asked Diane
to answer the door.

880
00:58:08,402 --> 00:58:09,569
Why didn't you go yourself?

881
00:58:09,653 --> 00:58:12,280
Supposing one of Laura's friends
had found me there.

882
00:58:12,364 --> 00:58:15,199
- Why open the door at all?
- They must have seen the light.

883
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:18,035
What about the girl? Diane,
what about her reputation?

884
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:21,664
I asked her to tell them Laura had let
her the apartment while she was away.

885
00:58:21,832 --> 00:58:24,083
Anybody that knew Laura
would have believed that.

886
00:58:24,293 --> 00:58:27,128
- Yeah. Go on.
- Well, then the doorbell rang again.

887
00:58:27,713 --> 00:58:30,506
I could hear Diane's mules,
Laura's they were

888
00:58:30,591 --> 00:58:33,593
clattering across the bare boards
between the rugs.

889
00:58:33,677 --> 00:58:36,178
Then there was a moment's silence
and then a shot.

890
00:58:37,264 --> 00:58:39,056
It was an awful explosion.

891
00:58:40,183 --> 00:58:42,768
By the time I reached her,
the door was closed.

892
00:58:43,270 --> 00:58:45,897
- She lay there on the floor.
- Did you go out to see who it was?

893
00:58:45,981 --> 00:58:49,734
No. I was too confused, too horrified,
incapable of doing anything.

894
00:58:49,943 --> 00:58:53,154
The room was dark. I saw only
a vague heap lying on the floor.

895
00:58:54,031 --> 00:58:57,074
I don't think
I fully grasped the situation.

896
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:00,328
I think I called her name,
but I'm not sure. I...

897
00:59:00,454 --> 00:59:03,623
I remember kneeling on the floor,
feeling her heart.

898
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:07,043
My first instinct
was to call the police.

899
00:59:07,127 --> 00:59:09,128
- Why didn't you?
- I don't know.

900
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:12,423
Or rather, I was afraid,
not only for myself, but for Laura.

901
00:59:12,633 --> 00:59:17,094
In a panicky sort of way, I felt I must
keep out of this to keep Laura out of it.

902
00:59:17,179 --> 00:59:19,347
I know now how foolish
and hopeless it was,

903
00:59:19,431 --> 00:59:22,016
but there was only
one thing on my mind,

904
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:24,685
the safety of a person whose life
was dearer to me than my own.

905
00:59:24,770 --> 00:59:26,479
Don't you understand that?

906
00:59:26,688 --> 00:59:28,189
Did you think
Laura had done it?

907
00:59:29,066 --> 00:59:32,026
- Did you?
- I don't remember what I thought.

908
00:59:32,444 --> 00:59:34,779
- Do you think so now?
- No.

909
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:37,156
- But you didn't?
- No.

910
00:59:37,491 --> 00:59:40,785
On Saturday, when our men went to the
hotel to tell you that Laura was dead,

911
00:59:40,869 --> 00:59:44,789
- you seemed sincerely shocked.
- I was. I hadn't expected that mistake.

912
00:59:44,873 --> 00:59:46,958
But you had your alibi ready
no matter who was dead.

913
00:59:47,125 --> 00:59:49,669
Yet you knew the minute
Laura got back it wouldn't stick.

914
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:52,588
Don't you see? I was incapable
of thinking that far ahead.

915
00:59:52,673 --> 00:59:55,216
I was incapable
of thinking at all.

916
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:58,761
I was groping for some way
to keep Laura's name out of it.

917
00:59:58,845 --> 01:00:03,015
I was heartbroken about Diane
and panic-stricken about Laura.

918
01:00:03,558 --> 01:00:06,018
I haven't slept a full two hours
since this thing happened.

919
01:00:06,144 --> 01:00:09,271
Let's get back to the present. What did
you and Laura talk about tonight?

920
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:11,941
I told her the whole story,
just as I've told you.

921
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:15,987
She phoned you after she promised me
she wouldn't call anybody.

922
01:00:16,071 --> 01:00:17,154
What did she want?

923
01:00:17,239 --> 01:00:19,281
It's perfectly natural
she should want to see me

924
01:00:19,366 --> 01:00:21,200
especially
after what's happened.

925
01:00:21,284 --> 01:00:23,828
Why don't you tell the truth? She sent
you here to get rid of this gun.

926
01:00:23,912 --> 01:00:27,248
She did not. It was my own idea.
She doesn't even know I'm here.

927
01:00:34,047 --> 01:00:36,882
- It works fine, doesn't it?
- Yes. Did you think it wouldn't?

928
01:00:38,385 --> 01:00:40,928
I hoped it wouldn't.
All right. Let's go.

929
01:00:42,389 --> 01:00:46,434
- Well, am I under arrest?
- No, but you're not to leave town

930
01:00:46,518 --> 01:00:48,119
and it would be
foolish of you to try it.

931
01:01:08,248 --> 01:01:10,082
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

932
01:01:13,253 --> 01:01:14,962
- What's that?
- Breakfast.

933
01:01:15,130 --> 01:01:17,423
You didn't buy any food
when you went out last night.

934
01:01:23,805 --> 01:01:27,308
I'll fix some bacon and eggs.
Can you make coffee?

935
01:01:27,601 --> 01:01:30,102
Suppose you set the table
while I get breakfast.

936
01:01:31,605 --> 01:01:33,606
Do you always sound like this
in the morning?

937
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:35,441
Don't tell me you can cook.

938
01:01:35,650 --> 01:01:39,779
My mother always listened
sympathetically to my dreams of a career

939
01:01:39,863 --> 01:01:41,572
and then taught me
another recipe.

940
01:01:42,282 --> 01:01:44,992
Don't move.

941
01:01:49,873 --> 01:01:53,209
It's all right, Bessie.
It's all right, Bessie.

942
01:01:54,127 --> 01:01:55,544
She's alive.

943
01:01:56,296 --> 01:01:57,797
It's all been
a mistake, Bessie.

944
01:01:57,923 --> 01:01:59,131
I'm not a ghost. Really.

945
01:02:00,926 --> 01:02:03,469
I found you, and you were dead.

946
01:02:04,054 --> 01:02:06,138
It was Miss Redfern's
body you found.

947
01:02:08,308 --> 01:02:10,559
How about taking over here,

948
01:02:10,644 --> 01:02:12,561
fixing us some coffee and eggs.

949
01:02:12,979 --> 01:02:17,024
But I saw it with my own eyes.

950
01:02:18,485 --> 01:02:19,860
I don't understand it.

951
01:02:19,945 --> 01:02:22,154
Have you ever
heard a ghost ask for eggs?

952
01:02:23,156 --> 01:02:24,782
No, miss.

953
01:02:24,950 --> 01:02:26,325
You'll be all right, Bessie.

954
01:02:37,129 --> 01:02:40,005
Somebody should have warned her.
Poor Bessie.

955
01:02:40,340 --> 01:02:43,342
By the way, I've asked Waldo Lydecker
to come here this morning.

956
01:02:43,426 --> 01:02:45,386
- Did you tell him?
- No.

957
01:02:45,971 --> 01:02:47,680
Why not? It's brutal.

958
01:02:47,973 --> 01:02:49,473
I'm not doing it for fun.

959
01:02:51,351 --> 01:02:54,520
Why did you break your promise
and go out and see Shelby last night?

960
01:02:54,855 --> 01:02:56,730
You forced me
to give you my word.

961
01:02:57,190 --> 01:02:59,692
I never have been and I
never will be bound by anything

962
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:01,694
I don't do of my own free will.

963
01:03:02,028 --> 01:03:03,946
Redfern was in love
with Carpenter.

964
01:03:04,990 --> 01:03:06,699
You admitted that last night.

965
01:03:07,033 --> 01:03:09,451
- May I have a match, please?
- I'm sorry.

966
01:03:09,870 --> 01:03:12,371
I also told you that
he wasn't in love with her.

967
01:03:13,582 --> 01:03:15,791
Just sit still.

968
01:03:23,550 --> 01:03:24,842
Hello, Lieutenant.

969
01:03:26,344 --> 01:03:28,637
- Morning, my darling.
- Hello, dear.

970
01:03:30,891 --> 01:03:32,558
Thank you.

971
01:03:32,726 --> 01:03:34,018
It's on again.

972
01:03:34,102 --> 01:03:36,142
Do I have to get a permit
from the police department

973
01:03:36,229 --> 01:03:37,897
to kiss my fiancée good morning?

974
01:03:38,148 --> 01:03:39,690
So he made you
change your mind.

975
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:42,484
Speaking of changing one's mind,
Mr. McPherson,

976
01:03:42,569 --> 01:03:44,361
I have just come
from my lawyer.

977
01:03:44,529 --> 01:03:47,281
Yeah? Did he tell you how much
you'll get off for good behavior?

978
01:03:47,365 --> 01:03:49,783
No, but he told me that anything
I may have said last night

979
01:03:49,868 --> 01:03:52,828
was said under duress
and can't be used against me.

980
01:03:52,913 --> 01:03:54,538
Besides, none of it was true.

981
01:03:54,748 --> 01:03:56,832
Smart lawyer you've got.

982
01:03:56,917 --> 01:03:58,876
Maybe he told you how that scotch
got up here Friday night

983
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:00,628
after you'd bought it
at Mosconi's.

984
01:04:00,712 --> 01:04:02,796
Maybe it was the lawyer
who brought Diane Redfern up here.

985
01:04:02,881 --> 01:04:04,673
Maybe...

986
01:04:10,722 --> 01:04:12,139
Well, McPherson,

987
01:04:12,265 --> 01:04:14,266
have you thought over
the deal I suggested?

988
01:04:18,396 --> 01:04:21,023
Waldo.

989
01:04:21,233 --> 01:04:22,775
Waldo.

990
01:04:26,821 --> 01:04:28,989
Right-hand pocket.

991
01:04:29,074 --> 01:04:30,783
You want a doctor?

992
01:04:31,076 --> 01:04:32,952
Right-hand pocket.

993
01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:35,287
We'd better take him
into the bedroom.

994
01:04:48,260 --> 01:04:50,020
- What...
- Don't try and say anything, dear.

995
01:04:50,053 --> 01:04:51,470
Just be quiet.

996
01:04:54,683 --> 01:04:56,934
I think this is
carrying things too far.

997
01:04:57,018 --> 01:04:59,270
Your methods are vicious.
There ought to be a law against it.

998
01:04:59,354 --> 01:05:01,647
- Yeah?
- How does he feel now?

999
01:05:02,399 --> 01:05:04,108
It was a terrible shock.
Poor darling.

1000
01:05:04,192 --> 01:05:05,734
Don't tell me you're in love
with him too.

1001
01:05:05,819 --> 01:05:08,320
Look here, fella. You're not to talk
that way to Miss Hunt.

1002
01:05:08,488 --> 01:05:10,489
Shut up. Why do you cover up
for a guy like him?

1003
01:05:10,657 --> 01:05:13,033
- Don't answer him, Laura.
- What story did he tell you last night?

1004
01:05:13,118 --> 01:05:14,878
Don't answer him. Let him
talk to our lawyer.

1005
01:05:14,911 --> 01:05:15,911
Our lawyer?

1006
01:05:15,996 --> 01:05:17,997
- So now you're covering up for each other.
- Look at him, Laura.

1007
01:05:18,081 --> 01:05:20,916
He's beginning to crack up.
He'd use anything to make an arrest

1008
01:05:21,001 --> 01:05:22,802
just so he can be a big shot
in the headlines.

1009
01:05:22,877 --> 01:05:24,962
I've got enough on you
to arrest you right now.

1010
01:05:25,046 --> 01:05:27,047
Quick, McPherson,
the handcuffs.

1011
01:05:27,173 --> 01:05:29,591
- Trundle him off to the hoosegow.
- You keep out of this.

1012
01:05:29,676 --> 01:05:30,926
You'll look nice in bracelets.

1013
01:05:31,011 --> 01:05:33,053
Why don't you get down
on all fours again, Waldo?

1014
01:05:33,138 --> 01:05:35,556
It's the only time you've ever
kept your mouth shut.

1015
01:05:35,765 --> 01:05:38,517
I hope you'll forgive
my wee touch of epilepsy, my dear.

1016
01:05:38,852 --> 01:05:40,394
It's an old family custom.

1017
01:05:41,104 --> 01:05:44,356
Well, McPherson, what does
Laura's resurrection do to you?

1018
01:05:44,482 --> 01:05:46,942
Too bad Diane Redfern
can't be resurrected.

1019
01:05:47,485 --> 01:05:49,862
I'm afraid I've interrupted
what you call "a pinch."

1020
01:05:50,488 --> 01:05:52,031
Do your duty, McPherson.

1021
01:05:53,116 --> 01:05:55,909
You know, Lydecker,
you've made me change my mind.

1022
01:05:56,411 --> 01:05:58,454
- For the moment.
- Well, in that case,

1023
01:05:58,538 --> 01:06:00,581
we'll have time
for a little get-together.

1024
01:06:00,707 --> 01:06:03,042
You'd better order some liquor
and some food, Laura.

1025
01:06:03,168 --> 01:06:04,877
What for?

1026
01:06:04,961 --> 01:06:06,641
People are coming
to celebrate your return.

1027
01:06:06,796 --> 01:06:08,881
Ann and Bullitt and Corey.
Everybody.

1028
01:06:09,132 --> 01:06:12,009
- Who asked them to come?
- I did, when I was in there.

1029
01:06:12,552 --> 01:06:14,345
I phoned my man,
and he's calling everyone.

1030
01:06:14,471 --> 01:06:18,390
- Why did you do that, Waldo?
- A sense of the fitness of things, my dear.

1031
01:06:18,558 --> 01:06:22,144
Perhaps our friend can weave all the
loose ends into a noose. McPherson?

1032
01:06:22,228 --> 01:06:24,628
Sorry you went to all that trouble.
I've already called them.

1033
01:06:29,402 --> 01:06:31,403
You're working yourself
to death, darling.

1034
01:06:31,529 --> 01:06:34,907
- I haven't had a moment with you all day.
- It's a very thirsty crowd.

1035
01:06:35,033 --> 01:06:37,242
After all,
it isn't your homecoming.

1036
01:06:37,327 --> 01:06:39,828
Aren't you being
a little bit nasty, Ann?

1037
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:41,997
I feel nasty
when I don't see you.

1038
01:06:42,123 --> 01:06:45,667
Well, you look very sweet. That's
a completely wonderful hat, darling.

1039
01:06:45,877 --> 01:06:48,462
Now, if you'll forgive me,
Laura wants a cocktail.

1040
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:51,256
- So do I.
- Well, here you go.

1041
01:06:52,550 --> 01:06:54,760
Shelby, why don't you
come to your senses?

1042
01:06:54,928 --> 01:06:58,305
You know it's all over between you
and Laura, or it soon will be.

1043
01:06:58,598 --> 01:07:02,059
But you haven't lost me.
Why don't we get married now?

1044
01:07:02,143 --> 01:07:03,519
Ann, dear, you don't seem
to realize the situation.

1045
01:07:03,603 --> 01:07:04,853
Yes, but I do.

1046
01:07:04,938 --> 01:07:08,315
That's why you need me. We'll get
the best lawyer that money can buy.

1047
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:10,776
When it's all over, we'll go away,
anywhere you want,

1048
01:07:10,944 --> 01:07:11,984
and forget about all this.

1049
01:07:12,112 --> 01:07:15,155
Thanks, Ann, but you see,
Laura needs me. Sorry.

1050
01:07:22,288 --> 01:07:24,123
- Laura.
- Thanks.

1051
01:07:24,707 --> 01:07:27,459
If you don't mind,
I'd like a word with Miss Hunt.

1052
01:07:27,627 --> 01:07:30,254
I don't mind.
Talk to her as much as you like.

1053
01:07:31,548 --> 01:07:34,800
- I see he's taking a new tack.
- What do you mean?

1054
01:07:34,968 --> 01:07:37,803
Trying to make you like him
to make you talk.

1055
01:07:38,888 --> 01:07:41,473
Shelby, tell me,
why did you go to...

1056
01:07:43,309 --> 01:07:44,560
Excuse me.

1057
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:49,148
Why did you go
to the cottage last night?

1058
01:07:49,357 --> 01:07:51,567
But don't you know?
I was afraid

1059
01:07:51,651 --> 01:07:53,318
you wouldn't think
of hiding that shotgun.

1060
01:07:54,446 --> 01:07:56,572
- What shotgun?
- The one I gave you.

1061
01:07:58,074 --> 01:07:59,992
You don't have to lie
to me, darling.

1062
01:08:00,493 --> 01:08:01,702
I'll stand by you.

1063
01:08:09,544 --> 01:08:11,003
What's the matter, Laura?

1064
01:08:11,838 --> 01:08:14,339
I guess I'm just nervous.
That's all.

1065
01:08:15,425 --> 01:08:16,842
So am I.

1066
01:08:18,261 --> 01:08:20,345
McPherson suspects Shelby.

1067
01:08:21,681 --> 01:08:23,390
He seems to suspect me too.

1068
01:08:25,143 --> 01:08:26,435
And so do some of my friends.

1069
01:08:26,519 --> 01:08:29,021
You? Don't be absurd.

1070
01:08:29,189 --> 01:08:31,857
- You could never do a thing like that.
- And Shelby?

1071
01:08:31,983 --> 01:08:33,650
I don't think he did it.

1072
01:08:33,776 --> 01:08:35,110
But he's capable of it.

1073
01:08:37,697 --> 01:08:39,865
Are you as interested in McPherson
as he is in you?

1074
01:08:40,283 --> 01:08:42,075
But, Ann, I only
met him last night.

1075
01:08:42,785 --> 01:08:44,495
That's more than
long enough sometimes.

1076
01:08:44,954 --> 01:08:47,789
Anyway, he's better for you
than Shelby. Anybody is.

1077
01:08:49,751 --> 01:08:52,336
- Shelby's better for me.
- Why?

1078
01:08:53,296 --> 01:08:56,215
Because I can afford him,
and I understand him.

1079
01:08:57,217 --> 01:08:59,218
He's no good,
but he's what I want.

1080
01:09:00,386 --> 01:09:02,638
I'm not a nice person,
Laura. Neither is he.

1081
01:09:03,264 --> 01:09:06,391
He knows I know he's
just what he is.

1082
01:09:07,018 --> 01:09:08,769
He also knows
that I don't care.

1083
01:09:10,104 --> 01:09:13,232
We belong together because we're
both weak and can't seem to help it.

1084
01:09:14,692 --> 01:09:16,735
That's why I know
he's capable of murder.

1085
01:09:17,779 --> 01:09:19,404
He's like me.

1086
01:09:21,658 --> 01:09:23,575
No, dear, I didn't

1087
01:09:24,410 --> 01:09:25,827
but I thought of it.

1088
01:09:43,930 --> 01:09:47,182
Hello? Yes. Yes.

1089
01:09:47,725 --> 01:09:49,309
It's for you, Lieutenant.

1090
01:09:50,728 --> 01:09:52,312
Thank you, Bessie.

1091
01:09:52,939 --> 01:09:54,523
McPherson.

1092
01:09:56,150 --> 01:09:58,819
Yeah, I know. Don't worry.

1093
01:09:58,945 --> 01:10:01,071
I told you I'd bring in
the killer today.

1094
01:10:02,782 --> 01:10:04,992
Yeah. I was just gonna
make the arrest when you called.

1095
01:10:06,327 --> 01:10:08,704
No, I can't tell you now.
I'm not alone.

1096
01:10:10,665 --> 01:10:12,291
You'll see when I come in.

1097
01:10:13,167 --> 01:10:14,751
Right. See you later.

1098
01:10:35,189 --> 01:10:36,440
All right. Let's go.

1099
01:10:37,066 --> 01:10:38,567
- You mean...
- Yeah.

1100
01:10:38,735 --> 01:10:40,402
Oh, no!

1101
01:10:42,363 --> 01:10:44,740
No. No, no.

1102
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:46,658
Not Miss Hunt.

1103
01:10:47,035 --> 01:10:48,660
Please!

1104
01:10:50,163 --> 01:10:51,747
Thank you, Bessie.

1105
01:10:54,042 --> 01:10:55,417
Thank you.

1106
01:10:56,669 --> 01:10:59,254
Now will you please be good enough
to go and get me my things?

1107
01:11:00,173 --> 01:11:02,174
- Yes, miss.
- Laura.

1108
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:06,511
Don't worry, darling.
Let them accuse you.

1109
01:11:07,013 --> 01:11:08,555
We'll fight them.

1110
01:11:08,931 --> 01:11:12,809
I have every weapon,
money, connections, prestige.

1111
01:11:13,019 --> 01:11:14,353
And my column.

1112
01:11:14,437 --> 01:11:17,773
Every day, millions will read about you
and rally to your defense.

1113
01:11:17,857 --> 01:11:20,567
You talk as if you wanted
to see her tried for murder.

1114
01:11:20,693 --> 01:11:25,822
Yes. Rather than let you blacken
her name with suspicions and rumors.

1115
01:11:26,491 --> 01:11:28,283
Try to prove her guilty.

1116
01:11:28,368 --> 01:11:31,119
Get on the witness stand
with your poor shreds of evidence.

1117
01:11:31,537 --> 01:11:34,373
I'll expose your cheap methods
you used on her.

1118
01:11:35,958 --> 01:11:38,919
- Thank you, Bessie.
- Laura, I told you to watch out for this fella.

1119
01:11:39,003 --> 01:11:41,213
- Can we go now?
- I warned you.

1120
01:11:43,508 --> 01:11:46,551
It's too bad you didn't
open that door Friday night, Carpenter.

1121
01:11:46,761 --> 01:11:49,346
- Wait a minute.
- Shelby!

1122
01:11:52,308 --> 01:11:53,975
Did he hurt you, darling?

1123
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:56,561
Darling.

1124
01:11:58,106 --> 01:11:59,606
Ann.

1125
01:12:03,861 --> 01:12:05,362
Come in.

1126
01:12:06,614 --> 01:12:08,198
Sit down.

1127
01:12:09,701 --> 01:12:11,576
- That'll be all, Gallagher.
- Yes, sir.

1128
01:12:15,248 --> 01:12:19,418
All right. Let's have it.
Look at me.

1129
01:12:21,754 --> 01:12:24,172
What are you trying to do,
force a confession out of me?

1130
01:12:24,257 --> 01:12:26,800
You've been holding out,
and I want to know why.

1131
01:12:26,884 --> 01:12:28,719
It'll be easier for you
if you tell the truth.

1132
01:12:30,388 --> 01:12:32,806
What difference
does it make what I say?

1133
01:12:32,890 --> 01:12:35,058
You've made up your mind
I'm guilty.

1134
01:12:35,143 --> 01:12:38,937
- Are you?
- Don't tell me you have any doubts.

1135
01:12:39,021 --> 01:12:41,690
Since you... Oh, I can't.

1136
01:12:41,774 --> 01:12:43,942
Please. Do I have to have
those lights in my face?

1137
01:12:50,283 --> 01:12:54,369
Thanks. No, I didn't
kill Diane Redfern

1138
01:12:55,037 --> 01:12:56,288
or anyone else.

1139
01:12:57,874 --> 01:13:00,375
Then why...

1140
01:13:00,460 --> 01:13:03,712
Why did you tell me the radio
at your country place was broken?

1141
01:13:03,796 --> 01:13:06,047
- Because it was broken.
- Not when I tried it.

1142
01:13:06,132 --> 01:13:08,972
Just as I was leaving the village,
I asked the local handyman to fix it.

1143
01:13:09,051 --> 01:13:10,510
How did he get in?

1144
01:13:10,595 --> 01:13:13,013
I always leave a key under the flowerpot
on the porch.

1145
01:13:13,639 --> 01:13:18,226
You're too intelligent to make up
something I could check so easily

1146
01:13:18,311 --> 01:13:23,148
but you're intelligent enough to have broken
it yourself to strengthen your story.

1147
01:13:23,274 --> 01:13:24,232
The main thing I want to know is

1148
01:13:24,317 --> 01:13:27,027
why you pulled that switch on me
about Carpenter.

1149
01:13:27,153 --> 01:13:30,697
You told me last night
you decided not to marry him.

1150
01:13:30,782 --> 01:13:35,118
- Yes, I guess I did.
- But today it was on again. Why?

1151
01:13:35,203 --> 01:13:39,456
Well, I changed my mind.

1152
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:44,002
What are you trying to hide? Don't you
realize you're involved in a murder?

1153
01:13:44,086 --> 01:13:46,963
You've got yourself in a jam it's not
going to be easy to get out of,

1154
01:13:47,048 --> 01:13:49,090
unless you're on the level
with me.

1155
01:13:49,175 --> 01:13:51,676
This is no time for secrets.

1156
01:13:51,761 --> 01:13:53,887
Now, did you really decide
to call it off

1157
01:13:53,971 --> 01:13:57,557
or did you just tell me that because
you knew I wanted to hear it?

1158
01:14:02,021 --> 01:14:05,148
What went on between you and Carpenter
when you saw him last night?

1159
01:14:05,274 --> 01:14:07,359
Did he persuade you to make up?

1160
01:14:08,986 --> 01:14:11,196
Or did you agree
to pretend you had?

1161
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:14,491
- Was that it?
- Well, we... That is, both of us thought...

1162
01:14:14,575 --> 01:14:17,369
He convinced you that if you
broke the engagement now,

1163
01:14:17,453 --> 01:14:19,996
people would think
you believed he was guilty.

1164
01:14:20,081 --> 01:14:23,583
Yes, but now I know it was only
because he thought I was.

1165
01:14:23,793 --> 01:14:26,795
- Did you believe he was guilty?
- No. I'm sure he isn't.

1166
01:14:26,879 --> 01:14:29,798
But he'd gotten himself
into an awfully suspicious position

1167
01:14:29,882 --> 01:14:33,134
and he's the sort of man that people are
always ready to believe the worst about.

1168
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:36,721
Are you in love with him?

1169
01:14:41,227 --> 01:14:43,061
I don't see how
I ever could have been.

1170
01:14:47,775 --> 01:14:49,526
Come on. You're going home.

1171
01:14:51,988 --> 01:14:54,906
- But I thought I was...
- That's what I wanted you to think.

1172
01:14:55,825 --> 01:14:59,035
You and a few others.
I didn't even book you.

1173
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:01,329
You mean this was
some sort of a game?

1174
01:15:01,414 --> 01:15:04,332
I was 99% certain about you

1175
01:15:04,417 --> 01:15:06,751
but I had to get rid of
that one percent doubt.

1176
01:15:06,836 --> 01:15:09,921
Wasn't there
an easier way to make sure?

1177
01:15:10,006 --> 01:15:13,425
I'd reached a point
where I needed official surroundings.

1178
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:17,596
Then it was worth it, Mark.

1179
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:22,517
I'll call a cab for you.

1180
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:38,325
Good night.
I'll see you tomorrow.

1181
01:15:38,409 --> 01:15:39,618
Good night, Mark.

1182
01:15:41,621 --> 01:15:43,622
I'm going over
to Lydecker's apartment.

1183
01:17:06,747 --> 01:17:08,790
It still doesn't
make sense to me, Laura.

1184
01:17:08,916 --> 01:17:11,084
He's playing some sort
of a game with you.

1185
01:17:11,752 --> 01:17:14,587
- I don't think so.
- I don't deny that he's infatuated with you

1186
01:17:14,672 --> 01:17:17,340
in some warped way of his own.

1187
01:17:17,967 --> 01:17:21,553
But he isn't capable of any normal,
warm human relationship.

1188
01:17:22,054 --> 01:17:25,015
He's been dealing
with criminals too long.

1189
01:17:27,143 --> 01:17:29,477
When you were unattainable,
when he thought you were dead,

1190
01:17:29,770 --> 01:17:31,354
that's when he wanted you most.

1191
01:17:31,439 --> 01:17:33,440
But he was glad
when I came back

1192
01:17:33,524 --> 01:17:35,525
as if he were waiting for me.

1193
01:17:35,693 --> 01:17:38,903
Do you know what
he calls women? "Dames."

1194
01:17:39,071 --> 01:17:42,407
A "dame" in Washington Heights
got a fox fur out of him.

1195
01:17:42,616 --> 01:17:45,785
- His very words.
- That doesn't mean anything.

1196
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:47,746
He isn't like that.

1197
01:17:48,539 --> 01:17:50,415
Laura, you have
one tragic weakness.

1198
01:17:51,417 --> 01:17:54,502
With you, a lean, strong body
is the measure of a man

1199
01:17:54,587 --> 01:17:56,171
and you always get hurt.

1200
01:17:58,215 --> 01:18:00,133
No man is ever
going to hurt me again.

1201
01:18:00,885 --> 01:18:03,011
No one, not even you.

1202
01:18:03,971 --> 01:18:06,848
I? Hurt you?

1203
01:18:07,266 --> 01:18:09,392
Laura, look at me.

1204
01:18:11,937 --> 01:18:15,023
When a man has everything
in the world that he wants,

1205
01:18:15,107 --> 01:18:18,276
except what he wants most,

1206
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:20,403
he loses his self-respect.

1207
01:18:20,780 --> 01:18:22,614
It makes him bitter, Laura.

1208
01:18:23,783 --> 01:18:26,534
He wants to hurt someone
as he's been hurt.

1209
01:18:28,662 --> 01:18:32,040
You were a long time
in finding out about Shelby,

1210
01:18:32,291 --> 01:18:35,085
but that's over now.

1211
01:18:36,378 --> 01:18:38,213
We'll be back together again.

1212
01:18:40,174 --> 01:18:43,551
Haven't you heard of science's
newest triumph, the doorbell?

1213
01:18:45,262 --> 01:18:46,721
I don't like to remind her.

1214
01:18:48,974 --> 01:18:53,770
- That was the murderer's signal.
- Did you eavesdrop too? I hope.

1215
01:18:53,854 --> 01:18:57,315
I thought you'd like to know. We
tested your shotgun. It isn't the one.

1216
01:18:57,983 --> 01:19:00,360
Now, that's what I call
a typical move,

1217
01:19:00,444 --> 01:19:02,946
a real key
to the man's character.

1218
01:19:03,572 --> 01:19:05,865
First he tells you that
he thinks you're innocent,

1219
01:19:05,991 --> 01:19:08,034
then proceeds
to check up on you.

1220
01:19:08,119 --> 01:19:10,161
When I report that I think
she's innocent,

1221
01:19:10,287 --> 01:19:12,455
that's my own personal opinion.

1222
01:19:12,540 --> 01:19:15,125
When I submit proof, it becomes
the opinion of the department.

1223
01:19:15,334 --> 01:19:18,002
This entire maneuver could be a trick
to get you off your guard.

1224
01:19:18,087 --> 01:19:19,754
It could be, but it isn't.

1225
01:19:19,839 --> 01:19:23,591
- I believe you, Mark.
- It's the same obvious pattern, Laura.

1226
01:19:24,135 --> 01:19:27,679
If McPherson weren't muscular and
handsome in a cheap sort of way,

1227
01:19:27,805 --> 01:19:29,597
you'd see through him
in a second.

1228
01:19:29,849 --> 01:19:33,101
Waldo, I mean to be
as kind about this as I know how

1229
01:19:33,185 --> 01:19:37,939
but I must tell you, you're the one who
follows the same obvious pattern.

1230
01:19:38,023 --> 01:19:39,941
First it was Jacoby, then Shelby.
And now I suppose...

1231
01:19:40,025 --> 01:19:41,192
- Laura, I...
- I don't think

1232
01:19:41,277 --> 01:19:42,652
we should see each other again.

1233
01:19:42,736 --> 01:19:46,781
- You're not yourself, darling.
- Yes, I am.

1234
01:19:46,866 --> 01:19:49,868
For the first time in ages,
I know what I'm doing.

1235
01:19:52,663 --> 01:19:54,914
Very well.

1236
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:57,584
I hope you'll never regret
what promises to be

1237
01:19:57,668 --> 01:20:00,044
a disgustingly
earthy relationship.

1238
01:20:02,214 --> 01:20:03,840
My congratulations, McPherson.

1239
01:20:05,050 --> 01:20:07,385
Listen to my broadcast
in 15 minutes.

1240
01:20:08,387 --> 01:20:10,722
I'm discussing
great lovers of history.

1241
01:20:31,952 --> 01:20:34,996
It was the most difficult thing
I ever had to do in my whole life.

1242
01:20:36,290 --> 01:20:38,166
All I need is the gun.

1243
01:20:43,005 --> 01:20:44,297
What are you doing?

1244
01:20:44,381 --> 01:20:46,341
Do you know the combination
to this thing?

1245
01:20:47,259 --> 01:20:50,970
- I never knew it had one.
- It must be somewhere.

1246
01:21:02,775 --> 01:21:05,610
- Have you ever seen this before?
- No.

1247
01:21:06,946 --> 01:21:08,446
Waldo gave you that clock,
didn't he?

1248
01:21:10,032 --> 01:21:11,532
Yes.

1249
01:21:13,035 --> 01:21:15,161
The doorbell rang

1250
01:21:15,371 --> 01:21:18,206
and Diane Redfern
went to the door in your negligee.

1251
01:21:19,792 --> 01:21:23,127
She opened the door.
The room was dark.

1252
01:21:24,797 --> 01:21:27,757
Waldo saw a girl standing there,
and he assumed it was you.

1253
01:21:28,968 --> 01:21:31,052
He figured that if
he couldn't have you himself,

1254
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:32,971
he was gonna make sure
that nobody else did.

1255
01:21:33,097 --> 01:21:35,139
So he let her have it

1256
01:21:38,727 --> 01:21:40,812
with both barrels,
right in the face.

1257
01:21:43,065 --> 01:21:44,816
She fell here.

1258
01:21:45,985 --> 01:21:48,278
Waldo heard Shelby running
from the next room

1259
01:21:48,821 --> 01:21:51,197
so he hid
in the stairway outside.

1260
01:21:53,284 --> 01:21:56,077
Shelby was scared,
so he ran out as fast as he could.

1261
01:21:56,203 --> 01:21:58,997
Then Waldo came back
and placed the gun in that clock.

1262
01:22:01,542 --> 01:22:03,626
I knew it.

1263
01:22:03,961 --> 01:22:06,170
I've felt it
ever since I came back

1264
01:22:06,255 --> 01:22:08,673
but I didn't want
to believe it.

1265
01:22:08,966 --> 01:22:11,676
I couldn't make myself
believe that

1266
01:22:11,844 --> 01:22:14,012
Waldo was a murderer.

1267
01:22:14,638 --> 01:22:18,349
- Well, he is.
- He didn't really kill Diane Redfern.

1268
01:22:18,851 --> 01:22:20,768
- I killed her.
- What are you talking about?

1269
01:22:21,020 --> 01:22:25,690
But I did, Mark. I did as surely
as if I'd pulled the trigger myself.

1270
01:22:25,774 --> 01:22:27,525
That's nonsense. Forget it.

1271
01:22:27,693 --> 01:22:31,612
No, Mark, I can't.
I'm as guilty as he is,

1272
01:22:31,739 --> 01:22:35,700
not for anything I did,
but for what I didn't do.

1273
01:22:37,411 --> 01:22:41,456
But I couldn't help myself.
I owed him too much.

1274
01:22:46,587 --> 01:22:48,963
I can understand that, Laura,

1275
01:22:49,048 --> 01:22:50,965
but I can't understand why
you've tried so hard

1276
01:22:51,050 --> 01:22:52,717
to protect Shelby these last few days.

1277
01:22:52,801 --> 01:22:55,053
I was nearly frantic for fear
you'd arrest Shelby.

1278
01:22:55,220 --> 01:22:58,264
I knew he wasn't guilty.
He hasn't enough courage to kill a fly.

1279
01:22:58,390 --> 01:23:01,392
And Waldo was doing everything
he could to incriminate him.

1280
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:03,603
It was his way
of getting rid of Shelby,

1281
01:23:03,729 --> 01:23:05,271
just as he did Jacoby.

1282
01:23:08,734 --> 01:23:10,902
I must say, for a charming,
intelligent girl,

1283
01:23:10,986 --> 01:23:14,280
you've certainly surrounded yourself
with a remarkable collection of dopes.

1284
01:23:16,033 --> 01:23:18,826
Don't touch anything.
Fingerprints will be important.

1285
01:23:21,121 --> 01:23:22,789
I'll have the clock
picked up tomorrow.

1286
01:23:23,248 --> 01:23:25,291
- What are you going to do?
- Arrest Waldo.

1287
01:23:25,417 --> 01:23:28,086
- Mark.
- Can't be helped.

1288
01:23:34,468 --> 01:23:36,761
That's to make sure
you're not disturbed.

1289
01:23:37,262 --> 01:23:39,013
If the doorbell rings,
don't answer it.

1290
01:23:39,723 --> 01:23:42,308
- I'll phone you in the morning.
- Good night, Mark.

1291
01:23:43,644 --> 01:23:46,813
Get some sleep. Forget
the whole thing like a bad dream.

1292
01:25:39,218 --> 01:25:42,887
And thus,
as history has proved, love is eternal.

1293
01:25:44,014 --> 01:25:47,308
It has been the strongest motivation
for human actions

1294
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:49,185
throughout centuries.

1295
01:25:49,561 --> 01:25:51,395
Love is stronger than life.

1296
01:25:52,231 --> 01:25:54,857
It reaches beyond
the dark shadow of death.

1297
01:25:56,568 --> 01:25:58,402
I close this evening's
broadcast

1298
01:25:58,529 --> 01:26:01,489
with some favorite lines
from Dowson.

1299
01:26:01,615 --> 01:26:03,699
Brief Life.

1300
01:26:05,327 --> 01:26:09,372
"They are not long,
the weeping and the laughter,"

1301
01:26:09,540 --> 01:26:12,583
"love and desire and hate."

1302
01:26:13,835 --> 01:26:16,045
"I think they have
no portion in us"

1303
01:26:16,380 --> 01:26:18,256
"after we pass the gate."

1304
01:26:19,424 --> 01:26:22,718
- Who's tailing Lydecker?
- I was going to, when he came out.

1305
01:26:22,886 --> 01:26:25,763
- He left five minutes ago.
- He didn't come out this way.

1306
01:26:25,931 --> 01:26:28,266
Must've gone out the back way.
Come on. Let's check.

1307
01:26:29,685 --> 01:26:33,854
"They are
not long, the days of wine and roses."

1308
01:26:34,815 --> 01:26:38,985
"Out of a misty dream,
our path emerges for a while,"

1309
01:26:39,111 --> 01:26:41,028
"then closes within a dream."

1310
01:26:43,323 --> 01:26:45,825
- That's the way it is, isn't it, Laura?
- Waldo!

1311
01:26:45,909 --> 01:26:48,369
You have
heard the voice of Waldo Lydecker

1312
01:26:48,453 --> 01:26:49,996
by electrical transcription.

1313
01:26:50,581 --> 01:26:54,458
Waldo, you've taken one life.
Isn't that enough?

1314
01:26:55,002 --> 01:26:58,296
The best part of myself,
that's what you are.

1315
01:26:59,339 --> 01:27:02,174
Do you think I'm going to leave it
to the vulgar pawing

1316
01:27:02,259 --> 01:27:05,428
of a second-rate detective
who thinks you're a dame?

1317
01:27:05,512 --> 01:27:08,264
Do you think I could bear the thought
of him holding you in his arms,

1318
01:27:08,348 --> 01:27:10,891
kissing you, loving you?

1319
01:27:11,977 --> 01:27:14,312
Laura! It's Mark.
Open the door!

1320
01:27:14,479 --> 01:27:16,147
- There he is now.
