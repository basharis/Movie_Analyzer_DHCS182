1
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:41,648
<i>We're all very proud</i>

2
00:01:41,727 --> 00:01:44,276
<i>of Judah Rosenthal's
philanthropic efforts,</i>

3
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:48,029
<i>his endless hours of
fundraising for the hospital,</i>

4
00:01:48,692 --> 00:01:50,615
<i>the new medical center,
and now,</i>

5
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:52,120
<i>the ophthalmology wing,</i>

6
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:55,495
<i>which, until this year,
had just been a dream.</i>

7
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:58,660
<i>But it's Judah Rosenthal,
our friend,</i>

8
00:01:58,744 --> 00:02:00,291
<i>that we most appreciate.</i>

9
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:03,795
<i>The husband, the father,
the golf companion.</i>

10
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,468
<i>Naturally, if you have...</i>

11
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:07,965
You're blushing, darling.

12
00:02:08,045 --> 00:02:10,047
<i>day or night,
weekends or holidays.</i>

13
00:02:10,589 --> 00:02:12,762
<i>But you can also call
Judah to find out</i>

14
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:14,889
<i>which is the best
restaurant in Paris.</i>

15
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:17,225
<i>Or Athens</i>

16
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:19,727
<i>or which hotel to
stay at in Moscow</i>

17
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:23,899
<i>or the best recording of a
particular Mozart symphony.</i>

18
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:27,694
My father is so nervous
about having to get up and speak.

19
00:02:27,773 --> 00:02:29,320
I know, I know.
I knew he was nervous

20
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:32,448
when you didn't eat any of those
cocktail weenies at hors d'oeuvres.

21
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:34,279
He was so courageous all week.

22
00:02:34,363 --> 00:02:36,411
Then suddenly tonight,
stage fright.

23
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:39,494
Really, Judah, you were fine till
you got home from work today.

24
00:02:41,078 --> 00:02:42,204
Any mail?

25
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:44,881
The mail's exactly where
I left it this morning.

26
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:47,084
I haven't had a free
second all day.

27
00:02:47,376 --> 00:02:51,097
If you gotta take a shower, you better
do it because I have to use it, too.

28
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:54,299
I dread making that speech tonight.

29
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,203
<i>Dear Miriam Rosenthal,</i>

30
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:22,369
<i>I'm at the lowest
point of my life</i>

31
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:24,045
<i>as I write you this letter.</i>

32
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:26,669
<i>I wish to cause no suffering,</i>

33
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:29,676
<i>but because I'm going
through pure hell,</i>

34
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:31,799
<i>I ask if you can
meet me one time.</i>

35
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,974
<i>Your husband and I are
more than intimate friends</i>

36
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:39,808
<i>and have been deeply in love
for over two years now.</i>

37
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,347
<i>This must be faced</i>

38
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:45,526
<i>as there are so many
ramifications and complications.</i>

39
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:48,646
<i>Many promises were made,
etcetera.</i>

40
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:52,490
<i>I need an open exchange
with you to clear things.</i>

41
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,652
<i>For all three of us to go on,</i>

42
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:58,831
<i>the situation has got to be
confronted in some fashion.</i>

43
00:04:00,282 --> 00:04:02,125
<i>Please contact me at this number.</i>

44
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:04,999
<i>I want what's best for everyone.</i>

45
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:07,209
<i>Dolores Paley.</i>

46
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:32,694
<i>That the new ophthalmology wing</i>

47
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:35,276
<i>has become a reality is not
just a tribute to me,</i>

48
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:38,028
<i>but to a spirit of community,</i>

49
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:39,954
<i>generosity,</i>

50
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:41,407
<i>of mutual caring,</i>

51
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:43,576
<i>and answered prayers.</i>

52
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:46,703
<i>Now it's funny I use the
term "answered prayers."</i>

53
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:47,788
<i>You see,</i>

54
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,589
<i>I'm a man of science.</i>

55
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,750
<i>I've always been a skeptic,</i>

56
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,881
<i>but I was raised
quite religiously.</i>

57
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,179
<i>And while I challenged it,
even as a child,</i>

58
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:59,300
<i>some of that feeling
must have stuck with me.</i>

59
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:02,640
<i>I remember my father
telling me,</i>

60
00:05:03,345 --> 00:05:05,768
<i>"the eyes of God
are on us always."</i>

61
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:08,392
<i>The eyes of God.</i>

62
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:11,399
<i>What a phrase to a young boy.</i>

63
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:14,238
<i>I mean, what were God's eyes like?</i>

64
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:18,736
<i>Unimaginably penetrating,
intense eyes, I assumed.</i>

65
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:22,823
<i>And I wonder if it was
just a coincidence</i>

66
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:25,159
<i>that I made my
specialty ophthalmology.</i>

67
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:30,455
I'm so proud of you, Judah.

68
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:32,212
Surely we all are.

69
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,699
Why did you write that letter?

70
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,451
You know why.
We've been through it.

71
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,783
You want to destroy my
life and my family?

72
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:08,119
I want her to know
the kind of man she's married to.

73
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,562
It was lying on the table all day.

74
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:11,292
By sheer chance,
she didn't open it.

75
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,044
By a miracle, I got it first.

76
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:15,626
You told me over and over
again you'd leave Miriam.

77
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:17,006
- We made plans.
- I didn't.

78
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:18,803
You did! I gave up things for you!

79
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,599
- Business opportunities.
- Oh, pipe dreams.

80
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,007
And there were other
men who wanted me.

81
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,467
What do you want from me?

82
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:25,260
You think this was
an easy decision?

83
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:27,220
I want what you
told me you wanted.

84
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:28,726
To be together.
Otherwise, I...

85
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:30,352
I don't know what I'll do, Judah.

86
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:32,309
I'll jump out the window, I swear.

87
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:35,104
You've been my whole
life for two years.

88
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:36,984
I can't go back to the
way things were.

89
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:39,691
I was at a low point when I met you.
You turned everything around.

90
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:41,026
I never said I'd leave Miriam.

91
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:42,549
That's wishful
thinking on your part.

92
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:44,909
Yeah, well, there's no
passion left. It's boring.

93
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:47,241
Those are your words,
unless you were lying to me.

94
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:48,416
Now, that's not true.

95
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:50,084
Or there's more to this than...
That I don't know.

96
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,753
- You met someone else?
- What?

97
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,080
Oh, come on, will you?

98
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:54,631
For God's sake, Dolores.

99
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:56,253
- Dolores.
- What?

100
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,088
Now, look.

101
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:01,004
I've lived with her 25 years.
The roots are very deep.

102
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,299
I mean,
I can't go on leading two lives.

103
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:07,226
Yeah, well, you're not doing her
any favor by pretending with her.

104
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:08,929
I'm not going to be without you.

105
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:10,810
I'm not going to let this
happen to me without a fight!

106
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:12,607
- Wait a minute, listen.
- I wanna speak to Miriam!

107
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:14,980
- I'm not gonna let this happen again.
- Dolores, nothing is happening,

108
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,107
- all right?
- No.

109
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:18,405
Yes. Now, listen to me, please.

110
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:20,649
Just bear with me.
We'll work something out.

111
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:22,700
Let me get my thoughts together.

112
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:24,660
Just don't do anything rash.
Now...

113
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:26,370
Dolores.

114
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:29,495
What?

115
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:34,546
It's gonna be okay.

116
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:38,667
on, God.

117
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,969
<i>- You were gonna wait until...
- Annie...</i>

118
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:43,846
<i>And then throw me aside
like a squeezed lemon.</i>

119
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,302
<i>Squeezed lemon.
Don't dramatize it.</i>

120
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:47,180
<i>I've given you the best
years of my life</i>

121
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:49,181
<i>and you were willing
to go on and on.</i>

122
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,477
<i>- Get out of here.
- May I...</i>

123
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:51,679
<i>I know you for what you are.</i>

124
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:53,481
<i>I'm lucky I found you out.
You're going out of here.</i>

125
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:54,773
<i>Those are my clothes!</i>

126
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:00,647
- That was great, wasn't it?
- Yeah. I loved it.

127
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,858
With the tuxedos
and the evening gowns and everything.

128
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:04,158
I know. It was great.

129
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:06,953
God, it was wonderful to
live like that. This is awful.

130
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:08,950
Let me see if I can get a cab.
You stay here.

131
00:08:08,976 --> 00:08:09,476
Okay.

132
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:12,621
So you want to go to the
movies again tomorrow?

133
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:13,998
Oh, sure, Uncle Cliff.

134
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:16,000
Jesus.

135
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:18,958
Unless... Unless maybe we should
make it a museum day, you know?

136
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,676
I promised your father
on his deathbed

137
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:24,220
that I would give you
a well-rounded education.

138
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:26,815
And, you know, we probably shouldn't
go to the movies every day.

139
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:29,600
Just... Just once in a while.
Even though I'd love to.

140
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:31,345
You know?

141
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:32,549
So, while we wait for a cab,

142
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:33,995
I'll give you your
lesson for today.

143
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:35,106
Okay?

144
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:36,687
<i>Your lesson is this,</i>

145
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:39,144
don't listen to what
your schoolteachers tell you,

146
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:40,707
you know?
Don't pay attention to that.

147
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,113
Just... Just see
what they look like.

148
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,907
And that's how you'll know what
life is really gonna be like.

149
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:46,360
Ok? You heard it here first.

150
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:48,491
I think I see a cab.
If we run quickly,

151
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:51,247
we can kick the crutch
from that old lady and get it.

152
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:55,956
I'm back.

153
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:57,705
- Where were you?
- Oh.

154
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:59,539
You know, just out and around.

155
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:01,879
You probably took your niece
to the movies again.

156
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,835
Oh, I'm crazy about that kid.

157
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:05,386
You know, she's just great.

158
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:07,055
My brother called. He's in town.

159
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,411
He wants us to join him
for a little dinner party tonight.

160
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:11,560
- Jesus.
- Oh, please, Clifford.

161
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:12,806
You gonna make another scene?

162
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:15,014
- Hey, I didn't make a scene last time.
- Yes, you certainly did.

163
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:17,190
You were not nice
and your resentment showed.

164
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:18,858
I don't resent him.
I've told you that.

165
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:21,561
You know, I happen to think he's
a pompous ass. You don't see it

166
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,567
- 'cause you're in love with him.
- What are you muttering?

167
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:25,606
- I'm not muttering anything.
- You certainly are.

168
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:27,446
You're running down
Lester under your breath.

169
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:28,742
Hey, I like your brother Ben.

170
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:30,912
Sure. Ben is a saint.
You're not jealous of Ben.

171
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:32,409
You think I'm jealous of Lester

172
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:33,889
because he's a television producer?

173
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:36,121
No. I think you're jealous
because he's a much-honored,

174
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:38,920
highly-respected man and he's
a millionaire 10 times over,

175
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:40,542
and he's doing what
you'd like to be doing.

176
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:42,920
Hey, listen,
I can't watch his stuff, ok.

177
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:44,171
It's submental.

178
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,127
I think he wants to talk
to you about a job.

179
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:47,679
I don't need a job.

180
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:50,678
And didn't I get honorable mention
at that festival in, in, in...

181
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,764
In Cincinnati? The Cincinnati
Documentary Film Festival?

182
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,186
This is what you're clinging to?

183
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,514
Everybody got honorable
mention who showed up.

184
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:00,100
Boy, things have really
changed around here.

185
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:11,536
Wendy, Wendy, Cliff, come here.
I want you to meet Lisa.

186
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,705
- Hi, this is my... My sister Wendy.
- Hi.

187
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,248
- My brother-in-law Clifford.
- Hi.

188
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:17,564
This is Lisa Crosley.
Lisa's gonna star in my new series.

189
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:18,747
I'm not really starring.

190
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:20,454
Yeah, well,
you're one of the stars.

191
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:22,414
- It's an ensemble piece.
- Mmm-hmm.

192
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:23,874
- Tell them who you're playing.
- Hello, Lester.

193
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:25,459
Oh, hi. Hello, darling.

194
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:27,862
- I'm so glad you came.
- Thank you so much for inviting me.

195
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:29,094
- It's a beautiful party.
- Thank you.

196
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,719
Why don't you have a drink. I'll be right...
I'm gonna see you in a second.

197
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:32,890
I'll be right there.

198
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:35,344
She gave a bundle to
the Museum of Broadcasting.

199
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:36,723
She paid a lot.

200
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,597
She plays, uh, she plays, um...

201
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,774
- A lawyer for the A.C.L.U.
- A.C.L.U. Yeah, yeah.

202
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:43,147
With a husband who writes
for a conservative magazine.

203
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:45,306
Yeah, gives us a chance
to get into issues, you know.

204
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:47,651
We're gonna try to be fair
to both sides, but,

205
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:50,028
knowing Lester, it'll be
heavily slanted to the left.

206
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:51,485
Well, let's hope so.

207
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:52,569
You know,
we're gonna shoot it here.

208
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,154
- You're kidding. You'll be here?
- Yeah, yeah.

209
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:55,705
Yeah. I want to shoot
more shows in New York.

210
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,077
- Oh, God. I couldn't be happier.
- I know. Me, too.

211
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:59,125
- Oh, this is great.
- I know, I love this town. I mean, it's...

212
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,160
You know, out there is such a Mickey
Mouse environment. I'm not interested.

213
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:04,164
In fact, that's one
of the reasons I'm in this...

214
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:05,669
- Hello, Lester.
- Hi, I want to talk to you.

215
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:07,671
Don't go away.
I'll be right with you.

216
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,219
Uh, we're go... A bunch of us
are getting together to, uh,

217
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:12,263
to build major studio
space for production

218
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:13,885
right here in,
you know, in the city.

219
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:16,639
In fact... I'm sorry.
Just give me one second.

220
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:18,974
Idea for series,

221
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:21,018
a wealthy, high-profile builder

222
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:23,566
who's always trying to realize,
uh, grandiose dreams

223
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:25,643
á la Donald Trump.
To be shot in New York.

224
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:26,853
Look who's here.

225
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:28,896
Oh, that's my brother Ben.
I want you to meet Ben.

226
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:30,365
Ben, Ben, Carol, come here.

227
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,920
- How are you, kid?
- Nice to see you.

228
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:34,531
- Hi, honey.
- Hi, sweetheart.

229
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,362
Hi, Cliff.

230
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:38,206
Listen, how are you doing?
How are your eyes?

231
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:40,162
Not so good.
It's not so optimistic.

232
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:41,367
Oh, you're kidding.

233
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:43,795
I've been seeing Dr. Rosenthal
for about three months.

234
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:46,589
Uh, Lester, I'm sorry.
Don't you want to talk to Clifford?

235
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:49,213
- Oh, yeah, yeah. Step into my office.
- Yeah, thank you.

236
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:51,051
Hi.

237
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:52,219
- Hi.
- I'm Lisa.

238
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:54,389
- Oh, hi. We didn't meet. I'm sorry.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

239
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:55,886
So, are you in T.V., too?

240
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,051
No.

241
00:11:58,134 --> 00:11:59,727
No. I'm a rabbi.

242
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:02,597
You don't have to wear
an outfit or anything?

243
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:06,810
Public television wants
to do a documentary on, you know...

244
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:08,019
Well, follow me around.

245
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:09,900
The way I talk, the way
I think, that kind of thing.

246
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:12,732
So it's for part of their,
uh, uh, Creative <i>Mind</i> series.

247
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:15,486
So I told them about you.

248
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:16,736
Oh, thank you.

249
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:18,779
You know, I'm...
I'm working on a thing of my own.

250
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,578
- I'm putting together a little film.
- Yeah, I know.

251
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:23,080
Wendy told me. You're trying
to make a film about, uh,

252
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:25,628
some philosophy professor,
which is admirable. That's fine.

253
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:28,377
But I'm... I'm... I'm offering you the
chance to earn some decent money,

254
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:30,254
you know, reach a big audience.

255
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:33,424
The last thing in the world you need
is for me to be your biographer.

256
00:12:33,503 --> 00:12:35,847
You know, I make
these little films on, on, you know,

257
00:12:35,964 --> 00:12:37,841
- toxic waste and starving children.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

258
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:39,426
Yeah, look, I'll be frank with you.

259
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:41,261
You're not my first choice.

260
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:42,971
I'm doing this strictly
as a favor to Wendy.

261
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:45,494
She says you haven't worked in a
long time. She's embarrassed.

262
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:47,938
I've worked. It's just that
nobody's paying me. I'm, you know...

263
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,815
Look, I know you
don't respect what I do,

264
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:52,272
I understand that. But, you
know, I got a closet full of Emmys.

265
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:54,778
You, you realize that. Oh, all right,
okay. You think that's bullshit.

266
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:56,609
Fine. Okay, fine.
I understand. Fine.

267
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:59,617
I don't know. Maybe I could use the
money to finish my movie.

268
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:01,869
You know, I... I do have
some debts and things.

269
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:04,034
Idea for farce.

270
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:05,289
A poor, uh...

271
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:08,292
A poor loser agrees to do the
story of a great man's life

272
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:10,965
and in the process comes
to learn deep values.

273
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:16,509
<i>What will you be
doing in Boston?</i>

274
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:18,510
<i>I'm lecturing at a symposium.</i>

275
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:20,683
Incidentally, my name's Dolores.

276
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:23,386
- Hello, Dolores.
- Hello.

277
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:25,517
- Pretty name.
- Thank you very much.

278
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:28,103
<i>Do you go to Boston often?</i>

279
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:30,025
<i>Not very often. No, I...</i>

280
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,645
<i>Don't know anyone
in Boston, actually.</i>

281
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:34,026
<i>- Really?
- Yeah.</i>

282
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:43,493
- Good morning.
- Hi, hi.

283
00:13:43,573 --> 00:13:45,996
A Miss Paley called,
and said it was urgent.

284
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:54,588
Why did you phone me?

285
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:56,594
I told you I'd call you.

286
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,637
I couldn't help it.

287
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:00,757
I was going out of my skin.

288
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:04,477
I have to see you later.

289
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:06,812
I have to.

290
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:09,307
Okay.

291
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:11,851
After work is okay.

292
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:16,902
I see it.

293
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:18,779
Yeah.

294
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:21,281
I see it.

295
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:24,076
Oh, God.

296
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:26,290
What?

297
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:29,539
I need to take a minute.

298
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:33,585
What's wrong, Judah?

299
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,009
I'm in such trouble, Ben.

300
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,837
What is it?

301
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:41,722
I need to talk to someone.

302
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:43,925
Sure.

303
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:47,478
We've known each other many years.
You're a religious man.

304
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,226
I'm... Okay, I'm not.

305
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:50,815
We've differed on many points,

306
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,608
but you're somebody I do respect.

307
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,319
May I confide in you?

308
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:56,738
Of course.

309
00:14:57,647 --> 00:14:59,866
Go ahead.
Everything's confidential.

310
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:06,535
I've done a foolish thing.

311
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:09,708
Senseless, vain, dumb.

312
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,415
Another woman.

313
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:22,680
Maybe I was flattered, vulnerable.

314
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,684
Maybe because she was
helpless and alone, I don't know.

315
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:29,182
But now my life's about
to go up in smoke.

316
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:32,265
Can't you break it off?

317
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:33,895
The woman won't allow it.

318
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:36,944
She's young.
She's very unstable.

319
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,862
She's an hysteric.

320
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:41,191
And vindictive.

321
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:43,155
And it's my fault.

322
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:45,615
I instigated it.
I prolonged it.

323
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:49,411
Many times I tried to back off,
but I was too weak.

324
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:51,785
But I promised her nothing.

325
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,962
But did I?
See, I don't even know anymore.

326
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:57,549
In the heat of passion,
you say things.

327
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,927
All I know is, after two years
of shameful deceit,

328
00:16:01,002 --> 00:16:02,219
where I led this double life,

329
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:03,888
I awakened as if from a dream

330
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:06,849
and realized what I'd be losing.

331
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:08,642
It's called wisdom.

332
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:10,720
It comes to some suddenly.

333
00:16:10,845 --> 00:16:14,600
We realize the difference between
what's real and deep and lasting

334
00:16:15,016 --> 00:16:18,316
versus the superficial
payoff of the moment.

335
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:21,155
You know,
I kidded myself about loving her,

336
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:23,066
but deep down I knew,

337
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:24,947
knowing I behaved selfishly.

338
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:27,741
For pleasure,
for adventure, for lust.

339
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:30,990
Sometimes when there's
real love and

340
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,493
true acknowledgment of a mistake,

341
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:35,795
there can be, uh, forgiveness, too.

342
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:38,540
I know Miriam.

343
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:41,375
Her values, her feelings,

344
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:43,511
her place among
our friends and colleagues...

345
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:44,670
But what choice do you have

346
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:46,631
if the woman is going to tell her?
You...

347
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:49,342
You have to confess the wrong

348
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:50,927
and hope for understanding and

349
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,763
maybe Miriam was responsible
in some ways, too,

350
00:16:54,222 --> 00:16:56,771
and you have to discuss it
and hope for the best.

351
00:16:57,934 --> 00:17:00,437
And maybe you and Miriam
can never go back to the old life,

352
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,865
but maybe there's a new one with
maturity and understanding.

353
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,362
Maybe I...

354
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,114
Maybe even a richer one.

355
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:10,655
You know what's funny?

356
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:13,541
Our entire adult lives,

357
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:16,498
you and I have been having

358
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:18,750
this same conversation
in one form or another.

359
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:19,830
Yes, I know.

360
00:17:19,914 --> 00:17:21,882
It's a fundamental difference
in the way we view the world.

361
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:25,963
You see it as harsh
and empty of values and pitiless,

362
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:30,221
and I couldn't go on living
if I didn't feel with all my heart

363
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:32,643
a moral structure with real meaning

364
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:34,811
and forgiveness.

365
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:36,973
And some kind of higher power.

366
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,479
Otherwise, there's no basis
to know how to live.

367
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:42,020
And I know you well enough to know

368
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:44,856
that a spark of that notion
is inside you somewhere, too.

369
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:48,117
Now, you're talking to me
like your congregation.

370
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:52,246
It's true.
We went from a small infidelity

371
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:53,994
to the meaning of existence.

372
00:17:55,116 --> 00:17:58,620
Miriam won't think two years
of scheming and dishonesty is a...

373
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:00,830
ls a small infidelity.

374
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,346
Oh, how can you do it?

375
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:18,356
I give up.

376
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,808
God, you're in such
wonderful shape.

377
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:23,019
- For a man my age.
- For any age.

378
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:26,940
I was actually quite athletic
when I was a young student.

379
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:28,898
You still make love
like a young student.

380
00:18:28,924 --> 00:18:29,424
Yeah?

381
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:30,785
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

382
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,285
You know,

383
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:36,804
I don't think we
should do this here.

384
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:38,024
Well, why not?
We're all alone.

385
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:39,247
I don't know.

386
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:40,874
I feel a little self-conscious.

387
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:43,126
Let's go back to the
cottage and light a fire.

388
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:44,798
And you can play me the Schumann.

389
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:46,171
Schubert.

390
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,502
- Schumann is flowery.
- Oh.

391
00:18:48,753 --> 00:18:49,970
Schubert is...

392
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:51,423
Well, reminds me of you.

393
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:52,597
The sad one.

394
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:54,054
Schubert.

395
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:56,139
God, you have to teach me all that.

396
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:58,312
I'm so ignorant in classical music.

397
00:18:58,387 --> 00:18:59,639
I'll teach you.

398
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:01,941
<i>Someday, we'll have a lot of time.</i>

399
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,746
Would you like a drink?

400
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:23,872
Yeah. Well, fix me
whatever you're having.

401
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:36,308
Why did you call the house last
night and hang up, huh, Del?

402
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:39,436
I'm not playing games, Judah.

403
00:19:40,763 --> 00:19:43,016
Just because you've decided
I'm through in your life

404
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:45,397
doesn't mean I'm gonna
roll over and die.

405
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:47,604
What the hell happened to us?
I mean...

406
00:19:48,396 --> 00:19:49,693
We had a wonderful few years.

407
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:51,524
We both knew it
couldn't go on forever.

408
00:19:52,483 --> 00:19:54,110
I gave up things for you.

409
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,866
Oh, come on.
That's poppycock.

410
00:19:55,945 --> 00:19:57,492
Don't give me that, will you?

411
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:58,788
For God's sakes.

412
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:02,035
There were no business opportunities.
It's all in your head.

413
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:04,037
No lovers begging for your hand.

414
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,669
I mean, I prevented nothing.
I... I... I...

415
00:20:07,498 --> 00:20:08,795
Can we not argue?

416
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:10,752
I just wanted to talk.

417
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:12,087
I'm just so rattled.

418
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,634
I have an idea.

419
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:18,267
I thought if we could get away.
Just...

420
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:20,515
Just for a little while
on one of our trips.

421
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:24,057
Our trips are the warmest
memories I have,

422
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,642
not just in our relationship,

423
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:28,148
but some of the loveliest
times I've ever had.

424
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:31,196
And you're always so much
more relaxed away from home.

425
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:33,232
You come to life.

426
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:35,367
Your whole face changes.

427
00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:38,120
I thought if we could just

428
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,948
get away to Boston or Washington,

429
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:42,916
just without any
preconceived notions...

430
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:44,790
I can't go away, Del.

431
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:48,949
- Just a weekend, just to be together.
- I can't, Del.

432
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:50,503
- Why not?
- I can't.

433
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,839
- You won't.
- Of course, I won't.

434
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,090
Right.

435
00:20:56,005 --> 00:20:57,177
Why not?

436
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:02,971
Because you're very unrealistic,
you know that?

437
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:06,140
Sit, sit down for a second.

438
00:21:07,308 --> 00:21:08,685
Let's talk.

439
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:13,113
Look.

440
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:14,816
I've been...

441
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,902
I've been thinking, too,

442
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,657
and it...

443
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,868
it occurs to me, I mean, if I...

444
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:24,992
If I have caused you
to miss out on any opportunities

445
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:26,793
that might have been
lucrative for you,

446
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:28,963
I'm... I'm perfectly prepared
to, to reimburse you.

447
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:31,006
I mean, I certainly don't
want to feel I've cost you...

448
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:33,254
I'm not after your goddamn money!

449
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:35,381
I want to speak to Miriam.

450
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:37,008
- It's her problem, too.
- Now keep her out of it.

451
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:40,091
- I want her to know the truth.
- Keep her out of it, all right?

452
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:46,147
I think she should know her husband
is a liar and an embezzler.

453
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:53,104
Don't you dare call me an embezzler.

454
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:56,740
I'm not blind.

455
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:59,911
I know what went on between those
philanthropies and your stocks.

456
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:02,408
I took nothing, not a nickel, ever.

457
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:04,286
My conscience is completely clear.

458
00:22:04,365 --> 00:22:06,083
You needed money
to cover your losses.

459
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,160
- I was around when it was happening.
- Okay, okay.

460
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:10,588
I needed some temporary help.
I mean,

461
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:12,965
for Christ's sake.
I mean, after a lifetime of hard work,

462
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,589
a man doesn't sit still and watch
himself go down the toilet.

463
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:16,968
I mean, does he?

464
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:20,013
And moving around funds
is certainly not stealing.

465
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:23,164
- Without asking or telling anyone?
- Look, listen to me.

466
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:25,223
Every cent was accounted
for with interest.

467
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:29,352
I don't think they
would see it that way.

468
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:31,604
So this is it, right?
This is what you plan on doing.

469
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:33,686
You're gonna hold on
to me with threats, right?

470
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:36,363
Stupid threats and slander.

471
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:37,759
This is your idea of love, right?

472
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:40,617
I will not be tossed out!
I want to speak to Miriam!

473
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:42,403
Think, for Christ's sake!

474
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:44,784
Well, think... Think what the hell
you're doing to me, will you?

475
00:22:44,947 --> 00:22:46,164
Please.

476
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:48,162
I can't figure it out.

477
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:50,035
I need you.

478
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:53,130
Del.

479
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,759
I love New York. I was
born in that building right there.

480
00:22:57,835 --> 00:23:00,930
Behind the... The guy, uh, the statue
there, the guy on the pedestal.

481
00:23:01,255 --> 00:23:02,677
I love New York. It's like, uh,

482
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:04,633
it's like thousands of,
uh, straight lines

483
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:06,685
just looking for a punch line,
you know?

484
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:10,139
And what makes New York
such a funny place, is that

485
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:13,977
there's so much tension and pain
and misery and craziness here.

486
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:15,939
And they got...
That's the first part of comedy.

487
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,567
But see, you got to get
some distance from it.

488
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:18,738
You know what I mean?

489
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:20,691
That the main...
The thing to remember about comedy is,

490
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:23,527
if it's... If it bends, it's funny.

491
00:23:23,611 --> 00:23:25,454
If it breaks, it's not funny.

492
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:27,657
So you gotta get back from the pain.
You see what I mean?

493
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:28,912
But the... The, uh...

494
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:31,540
Like they said, they asked
me up in, uh, at Harvard,

495
00:23:31,619 --> 00:23:33,713
a bunch of kids asked me,
"Why... What's comedy?"

496
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:34,879
So, I said...
And then this is...

497
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:37,299
This is part of what I'm trying
to say about getting back from it.

498
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:40,423
I, I said,
"comedy is tragedy plus time."

499
00:23:41,295 --> 00:23:42,797
Tragedy plus time.

500
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,757
See, when...
The night Lincoln was shot,

501
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,093
you couldn't joke about it.
You couldn't make a joke about that.

502
00:23:47,176 --> 00:23:48,473
You just couldn't do it.

503
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:51,852
Now time has gone by,
and now it's fair game.

504
00:23:52,473 --> 00:23:54,771
See what I mean?
It's tragedy plus time.

505
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,352
Okay. We're out.

506
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:57,687
That's it? So fast?

507
00:23:58,395 --> 00:24:00,818
I shot up 10 rolls on
your first question.

508
00:24:00,898 --> 00:24:02,946
All right, I gotta...
I gotta get to CBS Anyway.

509
00:24:03,025 --> 00:24:05,226
Remember where we were.
We'll start this again tomorrow.

510
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:06,612
Just... Just remember
what I was saying.

511
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:08,288
- What do you think? All right?
- Excellent.

512
00:24:08,364 --> 00:24:09,866
- Absolutely.
- I think I'm too cute.

513
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:11,041
I'm gonna do it more...

514
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:12,618
I'm gonna be more relaxed
tomorrow, you know?

515
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:14,328
I'm gonna do that tragedy stuff.
I got good stuff on that.

516
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:16,084
Yeah, this is Halley Reed
for Mr. Kurnitz, please.

517
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:17,756
Listen, would you...
Would you excuse me one second?

518
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:19,750
Listen, I know I told
you this before,

519
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:21,927
but if you play your cards right,
you could have my body.

520
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:23,563
Wouldn't you rather
leave it to science?

521
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:25,089
- That's okay, I'll wait. Thank you.
- Will you listen?

522
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:28,052
Will you listen? I'm offering you my heart.
You're squashing it. Come on.

523
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:30,852
When are you gonna quit
this organization, come work for me?

524
00:24:30,928 --> 00:24:33,431
Oh, you'd fire me.
I'm much too opinionated.

525
00:24:33,514 --> 00:24:34,857
No, no, no.

526
00:24:34,932 --> 00:24:36,525
- That's okay. I'll wait.
- Listen, I like...

527
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,318
I like mental stimulation.

528
00:24:38,394 --> 00:24:39,987
You tried shock therapy?

529
00:24:40,062 --> 00:24:41,782
That's good, that's funny.
That's very good.

530
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:43,357
Listen, Lester.
I'm sorry, but we've got...

531
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,987
OK, I'll be...
I'll be right with you.

532
00:24:45,067 --> 00:24:46,535
Wait in the car for me.
Wait in the car.

533
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:47,827
Arthur, wait in the car.

534
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:49,246
- Would you please come?
- Yes.

535
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:51,073
- You promise?
- Wait in the car. Wait in the car.

536
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:52,373
Yes. I... I was holding

537
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:53,998
for Mr. Kurnitz, please.
It's Halley Reed.

538
00:24:54,024 --> 00:24:54,852
What do you think?

539
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:57,288
Why don't you come with me
down to Barbados?

540
00:24:57,371 --> 00:24:59,499
We'll swim, you know,
we'll get some sun...

541
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:01,254
Sorry. I freckle.

542
00:25:01,709 --> 00:25:03,882
That's my best shot.
I can't do any better than that.

543
00:25:03,961 --> 00:25:05,178
That's okay. I'll wait.

544
00:25:05,254 --> 00:25:06,346
Okay. Look, think about it, okay?

545
00:25:06,422 --> 00:25:08,595
Please think about it.
Talk to you tomorrow.

546
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:11,684
Oh.

547
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:20,227
Yeah. It's Halley Reed.
You cut me off.

548
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:21,691
Excuse...

549
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:22,771
Okay.

550
00:25:22,855 --> 00:25:24,357
Excuse me.
We haven't officially met.

551
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,612
Hi. I'm Halley Reed.

552
00:25:25,691 --> 00:25:27,284
I'm one of the associate producers.

553
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:28,656
I'm Clifford Stern.

554
00:25:28,736 --> 00:25:31,205
Can I ask you the same
question that I asked the producer?

555
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,032
What do you bother
with this guy for?

556
00:25:33,115 --> 00:25:35,368
I mean, he's, you know,
he's such a pompous bore,

557
00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:37,704
- and your show does such great profiles.
- Well, listen,

558
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:39,163
I'll tell you just
between you and me.

559
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:41,214
I wanted to do
Gabriel Garcia Marquez.

560
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:42,382
That's perfect.

561
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:44,552
They like to mix it up.
They like a little variety.

562
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:46,503
After all, he is an
American phenomenon.

563
00:25:46,587 --> 00:25:48,180
Yeah, but so is acid rain.

564
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:50,223
Boy, you really don't
like him, do you?

565
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:51,926
I love him like a brother.

566
00:25:52,009 --> 00:25:53,352
David Greenglass.

567
00:25:53,427 --> 00:25:55,896
So, why... Why are
you doing this show?

568
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:58,895
It's very unusual for them to bring
in an outside person like this.

569
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:01,648
Well, yes, I know. I'm... I'm
doing it strictly for the money.

570
00:26:01,727 --> 00:26:04,247
I wanna, you know... I'm trying to
make my own documentary on...

571
00:26:04,313 --> 00:26:05,860
I'm doing a profile on a guy

572
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:08,158
who would be absolutely
perfect for your show.

573
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:09,951
- He would be worthy.
- Yeah, who's that?

574
00:26:10,027 --> 00:26:12,655
His name is Louis Levy.
Do, do, do you have

575
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:14,073
a little time?

576
00:26:15,157 --> 00:26:17,251
<i>Now, the unique thing that happened</i>

577
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,913
<i>to the early Israelites was</i>

578
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:23,499
<i>that they conceive a god that,
that cares.</i>

579
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:27,302
<i>He cares, but at the same time,</i>

580
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:30,138
<i>he also demands</i>

581
00:26:30,214 --> 00:26:31,887
<i>that you behave morally.</i>

582
00:26:32,508 --> 00:26:34,476
<i>But here comes the paradox.</i>

583
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:37,771
<i>What's one of the first things
that, that God asks?</i>

584
00:26:38,514 --> 00:26:40,733
<i>That God asks Abraham</i>

585
00:26:40,808 --> 00:26:44,028
<i>to sacrifice his only son,</i>

586
00:26:44,186 --> 00:26:46,109
<i>his beloved son to him.</i>

587
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:49,737
<i>In other words, in spite
of millennia of efforts,</i>

588
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:53,070
<i>we have not succeeded to create</i>

589
00:26:53,529 --> 00:26:55,702
<i>a really and entirely</i>

590
00:26:55,781 --> 00:26:57,579
<i>loving image of God.</i>

591
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:00,829
<i>This was beyond our
capacity to imagine.</i>

592
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:04,628
Boy, he's really interesting.

593
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:06,424
I know.
This is a fascinating guy.

594
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,797
He could be wonderful
for the series.

595
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:10,470
Well, that would be great.
You want to dump Lester and do him?

596
00:27:10,546 --> 00:27:12,594
'Cause I would love to...
You know, we could scrap Lester...

597
00:27:12,673 --> 00:27:13,970
We can't do...
We can't dump Lester,

598
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:16,802
but I could talk them into
a little financing for you.

599
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:19,308
And if this, you know,
if all this comes together right,

600
00:27:19,388 --> 00:27:20,435
and it should,

601
00:27:20,514 --> 00:27:21,606
I... I can tell you right now,

602
00:27:21,682 --> 00:27:23,559
we got some free spots
in the fall schedule.

603
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:26,270
That would be wonderful.
For me to get something on your series

604
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:28,196
- would be such a feather in my cap. Here.
- Thanks.

605
00:27:28,272 --> 00:27:29,364
You know, that would be great.

606
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:31,032
That would be the biggest
audience I ever had.

607
00:27:31,108 --> 00:27:32,485
Well, great.
You know, let's work on it.

608
00:27:32,568 --> 00:27:33,768
Let's... Let's make it happen.

609
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:34,910
Really? I got so much
good footage on him.

610
00:27:34,936 --> 00:27:35,304
Thank you.

611
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:36,723
You know, even though we just met,

612
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,407
I've taken an instant
liking to you.

613
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:39,958
And I to him.

614
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:46,506
Hi. I thought I'd come
by on my way home.

615
00:27:46,582 --> 00:27:47,799
- I... I got Jenny a present.
- Okay, come on in.

616
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:49,172
Is that you, Uncle Cliff?

617
00:27:49,251 --> 00:27:51,754
Yes, Jenny.
I got you something.

618
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:53,384
I got you a great book.

619
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:55,215
I got you an absolutely
terrific book.

620
00:27:55,299 --> 00:27:56,516
Hi, how are you?

621
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:59,846
I got you this great book with great
pictures of old New York in it.

622
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:01,100
Look at this.
Here, look at this.

623
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:03,148
- This is old 5th Avenue. See?
- Oh, my God.

624
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:05,271
- I told you, carriages and top hats.
- It's great.

625
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,397
I told you.

626
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:08,478
Then, there's a whole
section on speakeasies, here,

627
00:28:08,562 --> 00:28:09,859
which is really interesting.

628
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:11,440
- And that's the Flatiron Building.
- Mmm-hmm.

629
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:13,525
Which is a very famous building.
I'm in a great mood today.

630
00:28:13,609 --> 00:28:15,810
I had a creative breakthrough,
so my juices are flowing.

631
00:28:15,861 --> 00:28:18,080
I heard you got some action
on your ad in the personals

632
00:28:18,155 --> 00:28:19,327
which is, I guess, terrific.

633
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:21,659
This is the old
Madison Square Garden.

634
00:28:21,742 --> 00:28:22,868
Jen,

635
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:25,500
- don't you have some homework to finish?
- Yeah. I have to go do that.

636
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:26,831
So, we'll...
We'll look at this later.

637
00:28:26,914 --> 00:28:27,995
But there's great pictures.

638
00:28:27,998 --> 00:28:29,045
Yeah. Thanks a lot.

639
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:30,296
Cliff.

640
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:32,757
What's the matter?

641
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:34,467
I'm a wreck.

642
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:36,093
What... What is it?

643
00:28:37,007 --> 00:28:38,350
I'm a wreck.

644
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:43,105
Barbara, Barbara, what's...
What's the matter?

645
00:28:43,597 --> 00:28:45,224
- I feel sick.
- Barbara,

646
00:28:45,307 --> 00:28:47,230
- what... What is it?
- I'm still shaking.

647
00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:49,903
I've been shaking
like this for days.

648
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:51,821
What? What's wrong?

649
00:28:54,316 --> 00:28:56,239
I've been going out with this man

650
00:28:56,318 --> 00:28:58,161
that I met through
the personal columns.

651
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:01,073
<i>Very attractive.</i>

652
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:03,583
<i>He was very nice.</i>

653
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:06,871
<i>I went out with
him three times.</i>

654
00:29:06,954 --> 00:29:08,297
<i>He was never fresh.</i>

655
00:29:08,372 --> 00:29:11,000
<i>He was always a
perfect gentleman.</i>

656
00:29:23,637 --> 00:29:26,641
<i>So we both came back here,</i>

657
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:28,896
<i>and, um, Jenny was away.</i>

658
00:29:28,976 --> 00:29:31,604
<i>You know, she was sleeping
over at a friend's house.</i>

659
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:34,777
<i>And it was like 1:00
in the morning or something,</i>

660
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:37,534
<i>and we both had,
had a little to drink.</i>

661
00:29:38,402 --> 00:29:40,700
You know, I want to
tie you to the bed.

662
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:43,077
- Really?
- And rip your dress off.

663
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:44,282
Oh.

664
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,623
Have you ever, uh, been bound up,

665
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:49,709
tied up, and made love to?

666
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:52,792
Um, I'm... I'm... I'm a...

667
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:54,668
I'm a sensible gal.

668
00:29:56,253 --> 00:29:57,675
No more, you're not.

669
00:29:57,879 --> 00:29:58,880
Oh.

670
00:29:59,381 --> 00:30:00,633
God, Murray, God.

671
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,142
God, uh...

672
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:05,971
Barbara, I'm shocked
at what I'm hearing.

673
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:07,306
You're my sister.

674
00:30:07,389 --> 00:30:09,312
You're this nice
middle-class mother.

675
00:30:09,391 --> 00:30:11,064
What...
What are you telling me?

676
00:30:11,685 --> 00:30:12,982
I couldn't move.

677
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:15,530
I was tied tightly to the bedposts.

678
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:17,361
Oh, Jesus.

679
00:30:17,441 --> 00:30:19,614
By a...
A guy that you didn't know?

680
00:30:19,693 --> 00:30:22,492
Well, now... Now you're gonna tell
me that he robbed you, right?

681
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:24,247
No.

682
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,538
He got on top of me and...

683
00:30:29,286 --> 00:30:30,788
- And what? What?
- I can't say it.

684
00:30:30,871 --> 00:30:32,794
I just... I can't say it.

685
00:30:32,873 --> 00:30:35,251
What? Tell me.
What's so terrible?

686
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:37,753
He sat over me

687
00:30:38,295 --> 00:30:40,047
and went to the bathroom.

688
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:42,508
Oh! Oh! Oh!

689
00:30:42,591 --> 00:30:44,514
That's so disgusting!

690
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:45,977
Oh, my God.

691
00:30:46,053 --> 00:30:48,021
That's the worst thing
I ever heard in my life!

692
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:50,190
Then he took his clothes and left.

693
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:52,984
Oh, Barbara, you idiot!

694
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:54,687
This guy could've cut your throat.

695
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:56,067
He could've murdered you.

696
00:30:56,146 --> 00:30:57,773
I would've preferred it.

697
00:30:57,939 --> 00:30:59,361
Oh, Jesus,
you're such a dope!

698
00:30:59,441 --> 00:31:01,239
I wish I could have
sympathy for this.

699
00:31:01,318 --> 00:31:03,696
- That's the...
- Oh, that's so easy for you to say,

700
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:05,656
but I'm so lonely.

701
00:31:05,739 --> 00:31:07,992
You don't know what it's
like to be by yourself

702
00:31:08,075 --> 00:31:09,543
all the time.

703
00:31:09,618 --> 00:31:11,996
Look, I'm sure you're lonely,
I know it's painful,

704
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:15,379
but promise me that you're never
gonna place another ad again.

705
00:31:15,457 --> 00:31:17,380
Because that's just,
you know, it's ridiculous.

706
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:19,803
My whole life is
passing me by,

707
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:22,176
and I don't have
anyone to love.

708
00:31:22,506 --> 00:31:24,850
I know that's so hard
for you to comprehend

709
00:31:24,925 --> 00:31:26,393
because you're married.

710
00:31:26,468 --> 00:31:28,596
But it's just so lonely out there.

711
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:31,431
I mean, you have a
wife and you love her,

712
00:31:31,515 --> 00:31:32,812
and that's so nice.

713
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:34,063
Let me tell you something.

714
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:36,520
Things are not so good
between my wife and myself

715
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:38,230
just so you don't
get any illusions.

716
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:41,317
You know, we're... We... We've been
coming apart for the last year.

717
00:31:41,483 --> 00:31:43,656
You know, it's just that
neither of us has the energy

718
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:44,987
to do anything about it,

719
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:46,663
but it's not so great.

720
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:03,759
A strange man

721
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:06,054
defecated on my sister.

722
00:32:07,968 --> 00:32:09,140
Why?

723
00:32:12,097 --> 00:32:13,565
I don't know.

724
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:15,396
Is there any...
Is there any

725
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:18,854
reason I could give you that would
answer that satisfactorily?

726
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:21,440
You know, it's just so...

727
00:32:21,815 --> 00:32:23,817
Human sexuality is just...

728
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:26,035
It's so mysterious

729
00:32:26,236 --> 00:32:28,284
which I guess is, you know,

730
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:30,206
I guess is good in a way.

731
00:32:32,534 --> 00:32:35,003
Yeah, well, I gotta be up at 7:00.

732
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:49,309
I knew it had to be some
kind of a deep, dark secret

733
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:50,852
for you to stoop to call me.

734
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:52,645
I mean, to actually
invite me to your home.

735
00:32:52,721 --> 00:32:54,689
Come on, Jack,
don't hit me while I'm down.

736
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:56,357
I mean, who should I
turn to but a brother?

737
00:32:56,433 --> 00:32:57,980
I've been there for you.

738
00:32:58,059 --> 00:32:59,060
I'm here, aren't I?

739
00:32:59,144 --> 00:33:01,693
So don't make sharp cracks.
I didn't stoop to call you.

740
00:33:01,897 --> 00:33:03,274
I'm in serious trouble.

741
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:06,448
She won't take money,
she won't listen to reason.

742
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:09,162
I even toyed with the idea of
telling everything to Miriam,

743
00:33:09,863 --> 00:33:11,740
but she'd never be
able to live with it.

744
00:33:11,865 --> 00:33:14,835
Add to that, her blabbing
about my financial indiscretions.

745
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:17,037
Not that I stole, but I...

746
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,588
I was indiscreet and

747
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:21,716
if they look hard enough,
who knows what they'll find?

748
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,593
What would you like me to do?

749
00:33:23,752 --> 00:33:25,550
I don't know, but she's killing me.

750
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:28,553
Want me to have
somebody talk to her?

751
00:33:29,049 --> 00:33:30,301
Like what?

752
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:31,768
Straighten her out.

753
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:34,354
What do you mean, threaten her?

754
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:35,601
That's all I need.

755
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:38,270
How else do you expect
to keep her quiet?

756
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:41,103
I don't know.
Jack, I don't know.

757
00:33:43,313 --> 00:33:44,530
Well...

758
00:33:45,065 --> 00:33:47,033
Christ, Jack,
what are you suggesting?

759
00:33:47,943 --> 00:33:49,490
What did you call me for?

760
00:33:50,946 --> 00:33:52,198
I don't know. I... I hoped

761
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,749
you'd have more experience
with something like this.

762
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:58,711
You called me because you
needed some dirty work done.

763
00:33:58,787 --> 00:34:00,334
That's all you ever call for.

764
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:04,751
Look how bitter you are.

765
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:08,592
You've staked me plenty of times.

766
00:34:08,672 --> 00:34:10,891
I don't forget my obligations.

767
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:13,430
Threatening her would
only make it worse, Jack.

768
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:15,975
Okay. Forget about it.

769
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:17,351
What do you want me to say?

770
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:19,524
How the hell can I forget about it?

771
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,067
I'm fighting for my life.

772
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:23,979
This woman's gonna destroy
everything I've built.

773
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:26,026
That's what I'm saying, Judah.

774
00:34:26,106 --> 00:34:27,574
If the woman won't
listen to reason,

775
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:29,322
then you go on to the next step.

776
00:34:29,985 --> 00:34:31,612
What, threats? Violence?

777
00:34:31,695 --> 00:34:33,117
What are we talking about here?

778
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:34,573
She can be gotten rid of.

779
00:34:34,656 --> 00:34:36,124
I mean, I know a lot of people.

780
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:37,701
Money will buy whatever's necessary.

781
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:40,144
I'm not even going to comment on that.
That's mind-boggling.

782
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:42,464
Well, what did you want me
to do when you called me?

783
00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:45,004
Not to do dirty work,
despite what you think.

784
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:50,304
Anyway, it's gone beyond
just Miriam, now. She's...

785
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:53,804
She's talking financial doings.

786
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:56,970
I'm out of ideas.

787
00:34:58,013 --> 00:35:00,687
I don't know what I expected from you,
Jack, but maybe some help.

788
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:02,358
You know, you're not aware

789
00:35:02,434 --> 00:35:03,981
of what goes on in this world.

790
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,653
I mean, you sit up here
with your four acres

791
00:35:05,729 --> 00:35:07,402
- don't give me any of that stuff.
- ...and your country club

792
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,733
- I don't want to hear about my success.
- ...and your rich friends and

793
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:10,783
out there in the real world,

794
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:12,953
- it's a whole different story.
- Come on.

795
00:35:13,028 --> 00:35:14,826
I've met a lot of characters
from when I had the restaurant...

796
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:16,824
I know you have.
I've heard these stories before.

797
00:35:16,865 --> 00:35:18,959
From 7th Avenue,
from Atlantic City,

798
00:35:19,034 --> 00:35:22,129
and I'm not so high-class that I can
avoid looking at realities.

799
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:24,922
I can't afford to be aloof.

800
00:35:25,415 --> 00:35:27,634
And you come to me
with a hell of a problem,

801
00:35:27,709 --> 00:35:29,552
and, uh, then you
get high-handed on me.

802
00:35:31,296 --> 00:35:32,969
Jack, I don't mean
to be high-handed.

803
00:35:33,048 --> 00:35:35,088
I haven't been sleeping nights.
I'm irritable, okay?

804
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:36,889
- Okay. Okay. Forget I said anything.
- Okay.

805
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:44,146
Now let me just get
something straight here.

806
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:48,188
Am I understanding you right?
I mean...

807
00:35:49,898 --> 00:35:51,900
Are you suggesting
getting rid of her?

808
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:55,078
You won't be involved.

809
00:35:55,487 --> 00:35:56,989
But I'll need some cash.

810
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:03,499
What will they do?

811
00:36:04,371 --> 00:36:06,214
What'll they do?
They'll handle it.

812
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:12,007
I can't believe I'm talking
about a human being.

813
00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:14,215
Jack, she's not an...
An insect.

814
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:15,844
You don't just step on her.

815
00:36:17,509 --> 00:36:18,681
I know.

816
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,808
Playing hardball was
never your game.

817
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:23,352
You never liked to get
your hands dirty.

818
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:26,059
But apparently this
woman is for real,

819
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:28,528
and this thing isn't
just gonna go away.

820
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:32,649
I can't do it.

821
00:36:34,651 --> 00:36:36,198
I can't think that way.

822
00:36:37,404 --> 00:36:38,405
No.

823
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:41,282
Mmm-mmm.

824
00:36:47,956 --> 00:36:49,208
<i>Don't tell me.</i>

825
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:50,667
<i>I don't want to know
anything about it.</i>

826
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,252
<i>This is a work of art.</i>

827
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:54,546
<i>The ropes come off,</i>

828
00:36:54,671 --> 00:36:57,345
<i>I tie sash weights
to her ankles with soft catgut.</i>

829
00:36:57,424 --> 00:36:59,176
<i>Please.
That's a horrible word.</i>

830
00:36:59,259 --> 00:37:00,806
<i>Look, get the angle on this.</i>

831
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:03,229
<i>She disappears,
two weeks, maybe three,</i>

832
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:04,556
<i>then up she pops,</i>

833
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:06,141
<i>none of this stuff on her anymore.</i>

834
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:08,226
<i>No marks. A suicide.</i>

835
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:10,403
<i>Now, isn't that beautiful?</i>

836
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:12,901
<i>It's loathsome.
Now be sure no one sees you.</i>

837
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:14,233
<i>Don't worry, I'll take...</i>

838
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:16,784
This only happens
in the movies.

839
00:37:17,152 --> 00:37:18,825
Oh, listen, we should get back.

840
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:21,281
Lester's going to be
leaving the hotel soon.

841
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:22,741
It's okay. We'll make it.

842
00:37:22,824 --> 00:37:25,077
We've been shooting Lester all week.
I'm tired of it, you know.

843
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,753
We... We'll catch him in time.

844
00:37:26,828 --> 00:37:28,830
I never should have
told you my weakness

845
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:30,836
is going to the movies
in the daytime.

846
00:37:31,541 --> 00:37:34,090
I go all the time with my niece.
It's wonderful.

847
00:37:34,169 --> 00:37:35,967
You know, it's like playing hooky.

848
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:38,594
Yeah, that's what you said yesterday.
We were late then, too.

849
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:41,176
We weren't late.
We didn't miss anything. Here.

850
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:42,556
Have another cheeseburger.

851
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:44,353
- It's our lunch hour.
- Thanks.

852
00:37:45,722 --> 00:37:47,144
I got everyone up at the network

853
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:49,191
very excited over Professor Levy.

854
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:52,441
Yes, well, I have some great
stuff to show you later.

855
00:37:52,729 --> 00:37:53,901
Listen,

856
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:56,532
I brought you a present.

857
00:37:58,026 --> 00:38:00,950
Great. Now I can get rid of my
few remaining teeth.

858
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:05,034
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

859
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:07,790
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

860
00:38:07,869 --> 00:38:09,121
Ta-da!

861
00:38:09,204 --> 00:38:10,296
Look at his face.

862
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:11,964
- A treadmill.
- Yeah.

863
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,917
Just what I need.
You trying to tell me something?

864
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,343
You said you were bored
with the bicycle.

865
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:17,796
I'm afraid you're gonna find
this just as boring, though.

866
00:38:17,879 --> 00:38:19,426
Well, I think you're in
great shape already.

867
00:38:19,506 --> 00:38:20,632
Yeah, for a man my age.

868
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:22,388
- That's exactly what I was gonna say.
- Thank you.

869
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:25,016
Oh, it's great to see you enjoy yourself.
You've been so depressed lately.

870
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:27,313
This thing's great for tension,
you know, relieving tension.

871
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:28,765
I'll go get it.

872
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:30,236
Well, it's just like
the one at the club.

873
00:38:30,262 --> 00:38:30,625
Uh-huh.

874
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:31,415
burning calories.

875
00:38:31,441 --> 00:38:33,086
The one you saw that
you liked, remember?

876
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:34,441
Where are we gonna put this?

877
00:38:34,521 --> 00:38:36,241
I'm gonna have some
20 men take it upstairs.

878
00:38:37,232 --> 00:38:37,667
Your weight.

879
00:38:37,693 --> 00:38:39,430
It looks like a piece
of kinetic sculpture.

880
00:38:39,484 --> 00:38:40,861
No, no, it's not
gonna stay down here.

881
00:38:40,944 --> 00:38:42,617
It tells you, uh, you know,
how many calories...

882
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:44,163
Dad, Dad, it's for you.

883
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:45,456
Miss Paley.

884
00:38:45,782 --> 00:38:46,783
Oh.

885
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:48,163
Uh, she's a patient.

886
00:38:48,243 --> 00:38:49,723
Oh, on this phone?

887
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:52,042
Uh, yeah. She's going through a crisis.
I'll... I'll be back.

888
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:53,839
Hey, you don't...
You don't need a manual for this.

889
00:38:53,915 --> 00:38:55,087
What's the matter with the service?

890
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:57,486
- Why couldn't the service pick it up?
- ...I can use this.

891
00:38:57,919 --> 00:38:59,421
I'm calling from the gas station

892
00:38:59,504 --> 00:39:01,552
down the road from your house.

893
00:39:01,631 --> 00:39:03,633
I can be there in five minutes.

894
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:05,476
I'm going to,

895
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:08,263
unless you meet me here,
right now.

896
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:11,934
No, Judah. No, Judah.

897
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:16,529
No.
I wanna talk to you in person,

898
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:18,356
or I'm coming over.

899
00:39:35,248 --> 00:39:36,545
Just calm down, okay?

900
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:38,342
You keep saying
we're going away.

901
00:39:38,418 --> 00:39:40,045
I want to be alone with you.

902
00:39:40,128 --> 00:39:42,168
And when we get back,
I want you to bring everything

903
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:44,090
to a conclusion with Miriam.

904
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:44,733
Now, listen.

905
00:39:44,759 --> 00:39:46,997
I can't go on like this.
I can't wait forever!

906
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:49,224
- Del, listen, now, maybe...
- You don't know what it's like!

907
00:39:49,304 --> 00:39:51,022
Maybe it would help
if you talked to somebody.

908
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:53,225
I mean, like,
like a therapist or somebody.

909
00:39:53,308 --> 00:39:55,026
- Don't trick me, Judah!
- I'm...

910
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:56,853
Christ, I'm shaking.

911
00:39:59,147 --> 00:40:00,399
Listen...

912
00:40:01,858 --> 00:40:03,906
I brought you a birthday present.

913
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:07,155
I know how much you love Schubert.

914
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:22,712
<i>Sometimes,
when there's real love</i>

915
00:40:22,795 --> 00:40:25,890
<i>and true acknowledgment
of a mistake,</i>

916
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:28,559
<i>there can be, uh, forgiveness, too.</i>

917
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:33,056
<i>I know Miriam.
Her values, her feelings,</i>

918
00:40:34,182 --> 00:40:35,775
<i>Her place among
our friends and colleagues.</i>

919
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:37,022
<i>But what choice do you have</i>

920
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:38,899
<i>if the woman is going to tell her?</i>

921
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:41,527
<i>You have to confess the wrong</i>

922
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:43,608
<i>and hope for understanding.</i>

923
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:46,444
<i>I couldn't go on living
if I didn't feel with all my heart</i>

924
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:49,121
<i>a moral structure with real meaning</i>

925
00:40:49,197 --> 00:40:51,620
<i>and forgiveness</i>

926
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:53,167
<i>and some kind of higher power.</i>

927
00:40:53,242 --> 00:40:56,041
<i>Otherwise, there's no basis
to know how to live.</i>

928
00:40:56,746 --> 00:40:58,266
<i>And I know you well
enough to know that</i>

929
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:01,384
<i>a spark of that notion
is inside you somewhere, too.</i>

930
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:10,093
Could you really
go through with it?

931
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:14,477
What choice do I have, Ben?

932
00:41:15,223 --> 00:41:16,440
Tell me.

933
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:20,687
Give the people that you've
hurt a chance to forgive you.

934
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:23,356
Miriam won't forgive me.

935
00:41:24,232 --> 00:41:25,905
She'll be broken.

936
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:27,910
She worships me.

937
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:30,701
She'll be humiliated
before our friends.

938
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:33,124
This woman plans to make a stink.

939
00:41:35,076 --> 00:41:37,124
Did you make promises to her?

940
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:38,250
No.

941
00:41:39,247 --> 00:41:41,124
Maybe I led her on
more than I realized.

942
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:44,260
She... She's so emotionally hungry.

943
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:47,551
But it's deeper than
just Miriam, now.

944
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:49,928
Meaning financial improprieties?

945
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:51,555
No.

946
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:54,228
Maybe I...

947
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:57,432
Maybe I did make some
questionable moves.

948
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:04,564
Only you would know that, Judah.

949
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:06,445
I don't anymore, Ben.

950
00:42:08,026 --> 00:42:10,950
Sometimes it's worse than...
Worse than jail.

951
00:42:12,989 --> 00:42:14,662
It's a human life.

952
00:42:16,284 --> 00:42:18,286
You don't think God sees?

953
00:42:20,455 --> 00:42:22,628
God is a luxury I can't afford.

954
00:42:22,707 --> 00:42:24,926
Now you're talking like
your brother Jack.

955
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:29,134
Jack lives in the real world.

956
00:42:29,589 --> 00:42:31,967
You live in the kingdom of heaven.

957
00:42:33,468 --> 00:42:36,267
I managed to keep free
of that real world, but

958
00:42:36,596 --> 00:42:38,690
suddenly, it's found me.

959
00:42:39,474 --> 00:42:41,154
You fool around with
her for your pleasure,

960
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:43,478
and then when you
think it's enough,

961
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:45,484
you want to sweep her
under the rug?

962
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:49,325
There's no other solution
but Jack's, Ben.

963
00:42:51,027 --> 00:42:54,156
I push one button,
and I can sleep again nights.

964
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,282
Could you sleep with that?

965
00:42:57,533 --> 00:42:59,581
- No.
- Is that who you really are?

966
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:04,924
I will not be destroyed
by this neurotic woman.

967
00:43:07,627 --> 00:43:09,345
But the law, Judah.

968
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:13,386
Without the law, it's all darkness.

969
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:17,558
You sound like my father.

970
00:43:18,179 --> 00:43:19,396
What good is the law

971
00:43:19,472 --> 00:43:22,351
if it prevents me from
receiving justice?

972
00:43:23,392 --> 00:43:25,486
<i>Is what she's doing to me just?</i>

973
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:27,438
<i>Is this what I deserve?</i>

974
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:42,127
Jack? It's Judah.

975
00:43:44,372 --> 00:43:47,091
I think we should move ahead
with what we discussed.

976
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:50,966
How much will you need?

977
00:44:12,942 --> 00:44:14,535
Not funny.
It's not funny, guys.

978
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:16,704
No, it's not. It's not, not funny.
You're not thinking funny.

979
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:18,781
You got to think with your ear.
You know what I'm saying?

980
00:44:18,865 --> 00:44:20,663
Do... Do you understand
what I'm trying to tell you?

981
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:23,290
Look, here's the difference.
It's very easy, very easy.

982
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:25,918
If it bends, it's funny.

983
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,174
If it breaks, it's not funny.

984
00:44:28,249 --> 00:44:30,249
It's very simple. Wait a minute.

985
00:44:30,251 --> 00:44:33,095
Here, wait a minute.
Jeff, this is Alva.

986
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:34,509
Hi, pleased to meet you.

987
00:44:34,589 --> 00:44:35,886
Don't... Don't shoot this part.

988
00:44:35,965 --> 00:44:37,308
Don't, don't, hey.

989
00:44:38,009 --> 00:44:40,353
Alva's gonna play a small
part in the, uh, new series.

990
00:44:40,428 --> 00:44:42,828
I don't know what she's gonna
do, but I just know I want her.

991
00:44:42,889 --> 00:44:44,266
- It's wonderful. You look great.
- Thank you.

992
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:45,429
- It's wonderful.
- Thank you.

993
00:44:45,433 --> 00:44:48,152
Trust me, they love you.
Wonderful. Be right out.

994
00:44:48,436 --> 00:44:49,528
All right, okay.

995
00:44:49,604 --> 00:44:51,026
Don't do that while
he's shooting. Don't.

996
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:52,778
It's messing my hair up.

997
00:44:52,857 --> 00:44:54,279
All right, now, you
understand what I'm saying?

998
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:55,530
- No.
- Think of Oedipus.

999
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:58,238
Oedipus is funny. Oedipus...
That's the structure of funny

1000
00:44:58,321 --> 00:44:59,322
right there.

1001
00:44:59,405 --> 00:45:00,873
"Who did this terrible
thing to our city?

1002
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:02,541
"Oh, my God, it was me."
That's funny.

1003
00:45:02,617 --> 00:45:04,369
See, but the difference is one...

1004
00:45:04,452 --> 00:45:05,874
Don't do it while they're shooting!

1005
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:07,671
What the hell are you doing?

1006
00:45:09,624 --> 00:45:11,297
<i>You will notice</i>

1007
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:14,345
<i>that what we are aiming at</i>

1008
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:18,345
<i>when we fall in love is
a very strange paradox.</i>

1009
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:21,052
<i>The paradox consists of the fact</i>

1010
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:23,137
<i>that when we fall in love,</i>

1011
00:45:23,304 --> 00:45:26,103
<i>we are seeking to re-find</i>

1012
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:29,356
<i>all or some of the people</i>

1013
00:45:29,477 --> 00:45:31,980
<i>to whom we were
attached as children.</i>

1014
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:33,777
<i>On the other hand,</i>

1015
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:35,858
<i>we ask our beloved</i>

1016
00:45:36,317 --> 00:45:39,070
<i>to correct all of the wrongs</i>

1017
00:45:39,695 --> 00:45:42,073
<i>that these early parents</i>

1018
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:44,784
<i>or siblings inflicted on upon us,</i>

1019
00:45:45,117 --> 00:45:48,166
<i>so that love contains in
it the contradiction,</i>

1020
00:45:48,496 --> 00:45:50,840
<i>the attempt to return to the past</i>

1021
00:45:51,332 --> 00:45:53,676
<i>and the attempt to undo the past.</i>

1022
00:45:55,127 --> 00:45:57,255
See? No limos.
No bimbos.

1023
00:45:57,338 --> 00:45:59,466
No, no awards or anything.
This guy is just a...

1024
00:45:59,548 --> 00:46:01,425
You know, just a, a,
a thinker, an intellect.

1025
00:46:01,509 --> 00:46:03,056
You know, I was just thinking.
I was thinking

1026
00:46:03,135 --> 00:46:04,432
when you...
When you ultimately show this

1027
00:46:04,512 --> 00:46:06,640
to the pro... Uh, the people
that make the final decision...

1028
00:46:06,722 --> 00:46:08,442
- Mmm-hmm.
- ...l think you should emphasize

1029
00:46:08,516 --> 00:46:10,268
his overall view of life.
I mean, 'cause it's great.

1030
00:46:10,351 --> 00:46:11,944
It's large and life-affirming.

1031
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:13,817
- Well, well, I plan to.
- They love a positive statement.

1032
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:15,068
- Good.
- See, this is what I need, a little...

1033
00:46:15,147 --> 00:46:17,866
A little interest in my work. A little
encouragement or something, you know.

1034
00:46:17,942 --> 00:46:19,865
It's, uh...
Let me ask you something.

1035
00:46:19,944 --> 00:46:22,572
<i>I got a, a bottle of
champagne as a prize.</i>

1036
00:46:22,655 --> 00:46:25,454
It was sent to me from Paris.
I, uh, got honorable mention, you know,

1037
00:46:25,533 --> 00:46:27,877
for a little documentary
that I did on leukemia.

1038
00:46:27,952 --> 00:46:29,078
And, and, um.

1039
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:30,629
You want some champagne?

1040
00:46:30,705 --> 00:46:31,106
I... I... I...

1041
00:46:31,132 --> 00:46:32,448
We can open it and
celebrate or something.

1042
00:46:32,498 --> 00:46:34,125
I never say no to
champagne or caviar.

1043
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:36,208
Ok, that's perfect.
I, I have no caviar, of course.

1044
00:46:36,252 --> 00:46:38,425
I have oat bran which
is better for your heart.

1045
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:45,011
He was very eloquent on the subject
of love, didn't you think?

1046
00:46:45,303 --> 00:46:48,477
Yeah. Wish I had read him
before I got married, you know?

1047
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:50,983
It would have saved me
a gallbladder operation.

1048
00:46:51,058 --> 00:46:52,560
Sorry. What did you say?

1049
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:53,735
Nothing.

1050
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:55,654
You know, he wrote a
very interesting book

1051
00:46:55,730 --> 00:46:57,653
on human relationships.

1052
00:46:57,732 --> 00:47:01,032
He speaks very, very highly
of love at first sight.

1053
00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:04,239
My ex-husband and I fell
in love at first sight.

1054
00:47:04,405 --> 00:47:06,749
Maybe, I should have
taken a second look.

1055
00:47:06,866 --> 00:47:09,995
<i>No, actually, it was...
it was my fault as much as his.</i>

1056
00:47:10,077 --> 00:47:12,205
I noticed that you,
you still wear a wedding ring.

1057
00:47:12,288 --> 00:47:13,585
- Uh, urn.
- Is there any reason for that?

1058
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:14,665
Well,

1059
00:47:14,957 --> 00:47:17,801
I don't know. I guess I'm
just not ready to take it off.

1060
00:47:18,419 --> 00:47:20,171
It's good, you know?
You know, it keeps me

1061
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:22,131
from, from getting
asked out on dates.

1062
00:47:22,214 --> 00:47:24,254
Really, you must have had
a pretty terrible marriage

1063
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:26,306
if you... If you don't want to
be asked out on any dates.

1064
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:28,763
Well, no.
I mean, he, he was great.

1065
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:30,167
He was, you know, very brilliant.

1066
00:47:30,222 --> 00:47:31,382
- He's an architect.
- Uh-huh.

1067
00:47:31,432 --> 00:47:32,979
Real handsome and everything.

1068
00:47:33,059 --> 00:47:35,687
But if you're gonna have an
affair, not with my best friend.

1069
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:37,818
- Really?
- In my four-poster bed.

1070
00:47:37,897 --> 00:47:40,867
And they definitely didn't have
to finish all my pistachio nuts.

1071
00:47:42,151 --> 00:47:43,243
Really?
That inconsiderate? Well,

1072
00:47:43,319 --> 00:47:46,243
I hope it hasn't soured you
on, on marriage or men...

1073
00:47:46,322 --> 00:47:48,450
Yeah, I can hear myself
sounding like a bore.

1074
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:50,159
Just the opposite.
Hello.

1075
00:47:50,576 --> 00:47:52,999
Yeah, she's here.
How did you know?

1076
00:47:54,288 --> 00:47:56,040
Oh, hold on one second.

1077
00:47:56,123 --> 00:47:57,500
It's Lester.

1078
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:00,298
Hello.

1079
00:48:00,669 --> 00:48:01,795
Yeah.

1080
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:04,715
Sure, if you want me to.

1081
00:48:05,508 --> 00:48:08,057
Yeah, okay.
At the office at what time?

1082
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:09,724
- O0?
- O0?

1083
00:48:09,804 --> 00:48:11,772
- The building will be dark.
- Okay, that's no problem.

1084
00:48:11,847 --> 00:48:13,565
The floor is dark.
There's nobody at the office.

1085
00:48:13,641 --> 00:48:14,642
I didn't... Didn't hear that.

1086
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:16,398
The office is closed.
You'll be in a dark room with Lester.

1087
00:48:16,477 --> 00:48:18,229
no, I won't forget the outline.

1088
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:20,735
Yeah, the office is kind
of a spooky place at 9:00.

1089
00:48:20,815 --> 00:48:22,067
Definitely.

1090
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:24,026
Sure.
The hotel's even nearer.

1091
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:26,351
- That's... That's better for me.
- Don't go to the hotel.

1092
00:48:26,362 --> 00:48:29,206
- What was that? Okay, room 1911. Sure.
- Hey, you...

1093
00:48:29,281 --> 00:48:31,830
Okay.
I'll see you there. Okay.

1094
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:33,408
You're not gonna go
to a hotel with him.

1095
00:48:33,434 --> 00:48:33,982
Yeah, sure.

1096
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:36,414
- What's the matter with you?
- It's crazy. I better go with you.

1097
00:48:36,497 --> 00:48:38,795
- Oh, come on, don't be ridiculous.
- This guy, I know this guy.

1098
00:48:38,874 --> 00:48:40,421
He won't be able to
take his hands off you.

1099
00:48:40,501 --> 00:48:42,094
He'll get you in the room,
you know, and he'll...

1100
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:43,716
He'll read you your Miranda rights,

1101
00:48:43,796 --> 00:48:45,469
- and he'll tear your clothes off.
- No, he's interested

1102
00:48:45,548 --> 00:48:47,141
in producing something of mine.

1103
00:48:47,216 --> 00:48:48,593
- Your first child.
- Oh, God.

1104
00:48:48,676 --> 00:48:50,519
Listen, I've never
been seduced by a guy

1105
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:52,267
who wears loafers and no socks.

1106
00:48:52,346 --> 00:48:54,223
Much less one who says "nucular."

1107
00:48:54,306 --> 00:48:56,183
And he also says "foilage."

1108
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:58,068
- I don't like it.
- What are you doing with a copy

1109
00:48:58,144 --> 00:48:59,771
of <i>Singin' in the Rain?</i>

1110
00:48:59,854 --> 00:49:02,448
It's... It's the one
print that I own.

1111
00:49:02,523 --> 00:49:04,275
It's a...
It's a very good 16 mm print.

1112
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:05,985
- I play it every couple of months...
- Gosh.

1113
00:49:06,068 --> 00:49:07,536
to get my spirits up.

1114
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:08,783
You know, I, I, I saw it

1115
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:11,491
years... I don't know how many
years ago. I remember loving it.

1116
00:49:11,574 --> 00:49:14,202
Oh, they play it on
television very, uh, very frequently.

1117
00:49:14,285 --> 00:49:15,286
It's wonderful.
You want to watch it?

1118
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:16,450
You know, 'cause I could...

1119
00:49:16,495 --> 00:49:17,496
I could play it on this thing,
reel by reel.

1120
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:19,628
- Really? Don't you have some...
- Yeah. You want to have dinner?

1121
00:49:19,707 --> 00:49:21,675
- Anything to do right now?
- No, no.

1122
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:24,424
And, you know,
you got till 9:00. I, uh, I...

1123
00:49:24,503 --> 00:49:25,880
You know, why not, well,

1124
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:27,806
there's an Indian restaurant
right near. I'll send out.

1125
00:49:27,882 --> 00:49:29,634
You know, we could...

1126
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:30,801
You know.

1127
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:35,397
<i>All I do is dream of you
the whole night through</i>

1128
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:38,479
<i>With the dawn,
I still go on dreamin' of you</i>

1129
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:39,685
Mmm.

1130
00:49:39,768 --> 00:49:41,691
I love this Indian food.

1131
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:43,230
It's great.

1132
00:49:43,314 --> 00:49:45,032
You want some more tandoori mouse?

1133
00:49:45,107 --> 00:49:46,654
Just kidding.

1134
00:49:46,734 --> 00:49:48,407
You want some of the curry?

1135
00:49:48,486 --> 00:49:50,705
Uh-uh. Too hot. Too hot.

1136
00:49:51,238 --> 00:49:52,831
My... My teeth are melting.

1137
00:49:52,907 --> 00:49:54,534
<i>Sweet content
just dreamin' away</i>

1138
00:49:54,617 --> 00:49:57,496
Boy, this is the perfect way
to see this movie.

1139
00:49:57,578 --> 00:49:59,205
<i>Morning, noon,
and night-time, too!</i>

1140
00:49:59,288 --> 00:50:01,131
It's great, isn't it?

1141
00:50:01,207 --> 00:50:03,209
When you see Lester later,

1142
00:50:03,459 --> 00:50:05,507
you know, be careful 'cause

1143
00:50:05,586 --> 00:50:08,681
this guy tells you
he wants to exchange ideas.

1144
00:50:08,756 --> 00:50:11,259
What he wants is
to exchange fluids.

1145
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:06,631
Yes?

1146
00:52:06,874 --> 00:52:09,252
<i>I have a delivery
of some flowers.</i>

1147
00:52:09,418 --> 00:52:11,418
So, what you're
saying is Chris and you can't agree

1148
00:52:11,462 --> 00:52:12,805
on where you want to
spend your money.

1149
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,302
We can... We can agree
on something.

1150
00:52:14,381 --> 00:52:15,942
We talk about a lot
of different places.

1151
00:52:16,008 --> 00:52:19,103
It's just that I told Chris and I told...
I told you before.

1152
00:52:19,178 --> 00:52:19,678
Stanley.

1153
00:52:19,698 --> 00:52:21,672
I want to go someplace
warm, has beaches.

1154
00:52:21,722 --> 00:52:23,520
- Caribbean.
- But I also want to do

1155
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:24,600
things like maybe hike.

1156
00:52:24,683 --> 00:52:26,356
I think we should stay out of it.

1157
00:52:27,603 --> 00:52:28,650
You know,
I hadn't thought of Australia.

1158
00:52:28,729 --> 00:52:30,447
- Australia?
- Oh, we don't want to go to Australia.

1159
00:52:30,522 --> 00:52:32,490
You know, I should have
done what my friends told me.

1160
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:34,739
Just, just go where we wanted
to go in the first place.

1161
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:36,569
Where did you want to
go in the first place?

1162
00:52:36,595 --> 00:52:37,722
We wanted to go to Italy.

1163
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:38,872
So, what's wrong?

1164
00:52:38,947 --> 00:52:41,917
Dad, it's Jack.
He's on the phone.

1165
00:52:42,284 --> 00:52:43,831
- Who?
- I don't know what happened.

1166
00:52:43,911 --> 00:52:45,163
- We were going to go to Italy.
- Jack.

1167
00:52:45,245 --> 00:52:47,446
- Well, go to Venice.
- I thought we had it all decided.

1168
00:52:47,498 --> 00:52:49,500
- Italy is a wonderful place.
- Italy will be all right.

1169
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:51,085
We can have sun.
We can have snow.

1170
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:52,340
We could have everything we want.

1171
00:52:52,419 --> 00:52:54,342
Well, you could get snow, I guess.

1172
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:55,923
All my friends have
come back from, you know...

1173
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:57,508
- A lot of my friends have gone to Italy.
- What?

1174
00:52:57,591 --> 00:52:58,712
You're not going to go there

1175
00:52:58,717 --> 00:53:00,060
- because all your friends have been there?
- No.

1176
00:53:00,135 --> 00:53:02,354
I just wanted you to know
everything came out fine.

1177
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:04,056
It's over and done with.

1178
00:53:04,139 --> 00:53:06,437
No problems.
So you can forget about it.

1179
00:53:06,934 --> 00:53:08,277
Oh, my God.

1180
00:53:09,895 --> 00:53:11,272
Oh, my God.

1181
00:53:12,064 --> 00:53:13,782
I'm in shock, Jack.

1182
00:53:14,775 --> 00:53:16,118
Judah, I'm telling you,

1183
00:53:16,193 --> 00:53:18,616
it's like the whole
thing never existed.

1184
00:53:18,696 --> 00:53:21,791
It's a small burglary,
nothing more.

1185
00:53:23,117 --> 00:53:24,790
So go on back to your life

1186
00:53:24,868 --> 00:53:26,666
and, uh, put it behind you.

1187
00:53:28,622 --> 00:53:30,124
I can't speak. I'm...

1188
00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:32,793
I need a drink.

1189
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:34,093
Jack...

1190
00:53:36,171 --> 00:53:38,594
What am I gonna do?
I've got guests here now.

1191
00:53:44,972 --> 00:53:46,144
Jack,

1192
00:53:47,099 --> 00:53:49,147
God have mercy on us, Jack.

1193
00:54:31,268 --> 00:54:33,145
Mom, you told me
that Mary went...

1194
00:54:33,228 --> 00:54:34,445
Has been having acupuncture.

1195
00:54:34,521 --> 00:54:35,488
Yeah, she's tried it.

1196
00:54:35,564 --> 00:54:37,908
Yeah, she's... I think she's been
going for the last few months.

1197
00:54:37,983 --> 00:54:39,200
She hasn't gone back.
She stopped.

1198
00:54:39,276 --> 00:54:41,517
- She hasn't gone back?
- Is everything okay, sweetheart?

1199
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:44,020
You look kind of upset.

1200
00:54:44,072 --> 00:54:45,824
Yeah, I'm fine. It's just Jack.

1201
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:48,535
She's still wearing that
collar when she drives.

1202
00:54:48,619 --> 00:54:50,621
She's, you know, she can't
look around or anything. So...

1203
00:54:50,704 --> 00:54:52,832
I know,
but it's gotta hurt a lot.

1204
00:54:52,915 --> 00:54:54,516
I think I'd just consider
trying it, too.

1205
00:54:54,583 --> 00:54:56,506
We were talking
about, uh, oriental medicine.

1206
00:54:56,585 --> 00:54:59,634
Now, I have a friend
who consulted a Chinese physician

1207
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:01,306
with an eye problem.

1208
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:04,055
And he inserted a cat's
whisker into her tear duct.

1209
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:05,977
She's been telling this
story all week long.

1210
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:08,229
She's loves this story.
It's her favorite story.

1211
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:09,352
Yeah, and what happened?

1212
00:55:09,431 --> 00:55:10,603
- Well, it cured it.
- It did?

1213
00:55:10,682 --> 00:55:11,729
It did.

1214
00:55:11,809 --> 00:55:14,653
But you told me also
he, uh, he uses wires, too.

1215
00:55:14,728 --> 00:55:16,049
Well, because
why would you use...

1216
00:55:16,104 --> 00:55:17,526
Acupuncture,
you use needles. Not wires.

1217
00:55:17,606 --> 00:55:19,324
But very fine,
almost like, almost...

1218
00:55:19,399 --> 00:55:20,491
<i>Yeah, but that's
a different procedure.</i>

1219
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:21,534
<i>It's for something else.</i>

1220
00:55:21,610 --> 00:55:23,487
<i>What do you think, Judah?</i>

1221
00:55:24,613 --> 00:55:25,785
Judah?

1222
00:55:26,615 --> 00:55:28,663
Judah, what do you think, hmm?

1223
00:55:28,909 --> 00:55:32,709
I think I've done a,
a terrible thing.

1224
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:35,253
What's wrong, honey?

1225
00:55:36,667 --> 00:55:37,793
I...

1226
00:55:38,627 --> 00:55:40,095
I left these papers at the office

1227
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:42,013
which I absolutely need tonight.

1228
00:55:42,089 --> 00:55:43,181
Look, sweetheart, don't...

1229
00:55:43,257 --> 00:55:45,430
I can't believe I did this.
How negligent of me.

1230
00:55:45,509 --> 00:55:47,056
I've never done this before.

1231
00:55:47,135 --> 00:55:49,103
I've got this major conference
first thing in the morning,

1232
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:51,181
- and I left these papers there.
- No, darling, you're not gonna go

1233
00:55:51,265 --> 00:55:52,608
- and get them tonight.
- I have to get them tonight...

1234
00:55:52,683 --> 00:55:53,684
You can go and get
them in the morning.

1235
00:55:53,767 --> 00:55:54,859
because I got an
hour's work to do.

1236
00:55:54,935 --> 00:55:56,562
Yeah, but we're in the middle
of a dinner party.

1237
00:55:56,645 --> 00:55:59,444
I'm so sorry. Please forgive me.
I, I, I, I...

1238
00:55:59,523 --> 00:56:01,366
- Don't apologize.
- Yeah, I don't like you driving.

1239
00:56:01,441 --> 00:56:02,863
I don't like him driving at night.

1240
00:56:02,943 --> 00:56:04,035
- It worries me.
- Well, Chris can...

1241
00:56:04,111 --> 00:56:06,364
Stanley, I'm so sorry about this.

1242
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:10,743
- Would you like some company?
- No, no, not at all.

1243
00:56:10,826 --> 00:56:13,124
Darling, forgive me,
but I must leave.

1244
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:15,046
- Honey, Chris, will take you.
- It was a wonderful evening.

1245
00:56:15,122 --> 00:56:17,545
- I enjoyed it so much.
- Oh, it was wonderful.

1246
00:56:17,875 --> 00:56:18,922
Thank you.

1247
00:56:19,001 --> 00:56:20,844
Oh, don't... Don't worry about us.
No, we're fine.

1248
00:56:20,919 --> 00:56:23,342
I do apologize.
We couldn't apologize more.

1249
00:56:23,422 --> 00:56:25,800
Let's just finish the coffee,
sit down, and he'll be back.

1250
00:56:25,883 --> 00:56:27,260
Well, you know, it's late.

1251
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:40,100
<i>I'll say it once again.</i>

1252
00:58:40,726 --> 00:58:42,945
The eyes of God see all.

1253
00:58:44,271 --> 00:58:45,363
Listen to me, Judah.

1254
00:58:45,439 --> 00:58:48,909
There is absolutely nothing
that escapes his sight.

1255
00:58:49,109 --> 00:58:52,238
He sees the righteous,
and he sees the wicked.

1256
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:54,539
And the righteous will be rewarded,

1257
00:58:54,865 --> 00:58:59,211
but the wicked will be
punished for eternity.

1258
01:00:23,703 --> 01:00:24,875
Hello?

1259
01:00:26,039 --> 01:00:27,211
Hello?

1260
01:00:28,792 --> 01:00:30,385
Hello? Hello?

1261
01:01:03,702 --> 01:01:05,170
I want your opinion on this.

1262
01:01:05,245 --> 01:01:07,168
We're doing a special
show on jazz, here.

1263
01:01:07,247 --> 01:01:09,545
I'd really like to know what you think.
I admire her opinions, so.

1264
01:01:09,624 --> 01:01:12,218
Did you tell him I want to... I want
to get involved in producing that idea

1265
01:01:12,294 --> 01:01:13,466
- you have for a series?
- No.

1266
01:01:13,545 --> 01:01:14,671
Oh, it's wonderful, it's great.

1267
01:01:14,754 --> 01:01:17,348
She wants to do a different
Chekhov story every month.

1268
01:01:17,424 --> 01:01:18,892
The guy wrote a million of them.

1269
01:01:18,967 --> 01:01:20,207
It's very sweet of you.

1270
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:22,012
Well, I told you I'm
putty in your hands.

1271
01:01:22,095 --> 01:01:23,813
What am I gonna do
with a handful of putty?

1272
01:01:23,889 --> 01:01:25,857
Look at her. She's always
got a zinger. Isn't that great?

1273
01:01:25,932 --> 01:01:27,934
This vixen, this minx.

1274
01:01:28,018 --> 01:01:29,736
We should really
be going, shouldn't we?

1275
01:01:29,811 --> 01:01:32,405
'Cause we have to pick up those
air sick bags and something else.

1276
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:33,823
I, uh, well,
we really do have to go.

1277
01:01:33,899 --> 01:01:35,822
I've got to get up at dawn
and teach Emily Dickinson

1278
01:01:35,901 --> 01:01:37,995
to a bunch of upper
middle-class crack addicts.

1279
01:01:38,069 --> 01:01:39,742
One of my favorite poets.

1280
01:01:39,821 --> 01:01:40,993
Me, too.

1281
01:01:41,072 --> 01:01:43,245
"Because I could
not stop for death..."

1282
01:01:43,325 --> 01:01:44,918
"He kindly stopped for me"

1283
01:01:44,993 --> 01:01:46,461
The word "kindly," right?

1284
01:01:46,786 --> 01:01:50,211
"The carriage held
but just ourselves and immortality

1285
01:01:50,624 --> 01:01:53,002
"We slowly drove,
he knew no haste

1286
01:01:53,084 --> 01:01:55,633
"and I had put away
my labor and my leisure, too

1287
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:56,964
"for his civility"

1288
01:01:57,047 --> 01:01:59,049
Lester was a great
English student in college.

1289
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:00,600
Not that I graduated.

1290
01:02:00,675 --> 01:02:02,723
I mean, it's...
It's amazing. I couldn't graduate,

1291
01:02:02,802 --> 01:02:06,557
and the same school now teaches
a course in existential motifs

1292
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:07,857
in my situation comedies.

1293
01:02:07,933 --> 01:02:09,606
- Really?
- Yeah.

1294
01:02:09,684 --> 01:02:10,936
Where'd you go to college, Halley?

1295
01:02:11,019 --> 01:02:12,020
Columbia.

1296
01:02:12,103 --> 01:02:15,027
You went to Columbia. What, uh,
what'd you... What's! you major in?

1297
01:02:15,106 --> 01:02:17,905
Law. I... I graduated
from the law school.

1298
01:02:17,984 --> 01:02:19,486
- You didn't practice?
- Yes, I did.

1299
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:23,164
I, uh, but then, you know I...
I met my husband and

1300
01:02:23,531 --> 01:02:25,124
we moved to Europe for a while.

1301
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:27,498
It's a long, boring story, but...

1302
01:02:27,661 --> 01:02:29,834
I wish you'd go back
to your old job.

1303
01:02:29,996 --> 01:02:31,964
I used to edit
newsreel footage, so,

1304
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:34,259
you know, floods,
and fires and famines

1305
01:02:34,334 --> 01:02:36,257
and, uh, it's depressing.

1306
01:02:36,336 --> 01:02:37,976
Listen, we don't all
have to go, you know.

1307
01:02:38,046 --> 01:02:39,343
Oh, no. I do.

1308
01:02:39,422 --> 01:02:40,799
You know what?
I'll tell you what. We'll go,

1309
01:02:40,882 --> 01:02:43,385
and why don't you two stay, and you
have business to talk over, right?

1310
01:02:43,468 --> 01:02:44,789
I could go with you, if you like.

1311
01:02:44,844 --> 01:02:45,936
Let's just go. Okay?

1312
01:02:46,012 --> 01:02:47,935
Why don't... Why don't
we go someplace quiet for a drink?

1313
01:02:48,014 --> 01:02:49,607
I wouldn't mind that.
It's fine.

1314
01:02:49,683 --> 01:02:51,481
I'm... I'm just exhausted.

1315
01:02:51,559 --> 01:02:52,856
From what? It's early.

1316
01:02:52,936 --> 01:02:54,062
Some other time.

1317
01:02:54,145 --> 01:02:55,237
Come on, one little drink.

1318
01:02:55,313 --> 01:02:57,190
Really. Some other time.

1319
01:02:58,858 --> 01:03:01,657
Jesus, Lester was
so pushy tonight, you know.

1320
01:03:01,736 --> 01:03:03,283
He comes on with Halley

1321
01:03:03,363 --> 01:03:04,990
like it's business,
but he's after her.

1322
01:03:05,073 --> 01:03:06,666
Oh, please,
what are you talking about?

1323
01:03:06,741 --> 01:03:08,021
She really likes him.
I can tell.

1324
01:03:08,076 --> 01:03:10,170
Oh, you've got to be kidding.
You tell me she likes him?

1325
01:03:10,245 --> 01:03:11,417
What, kidding?
What's not to like?

1326
01:03:11,496 --> 01:03:13,214
What, you think I'm crazy?
He's, he's attractive,

1327
01:03:13,290 --> 01:03:14,792
he's, he's rich.
He's the most charming man.

1328
01:03:14,874 --> 01:03:16,154
He's your brother is what he is.

1329
01:03:16,209 --> 01:03:18,303
You know, you're prejudiced.
She put him down pretty good

1330
01:03:18,378 --> 01:03:19,595
when he said,
"Let's go have a drink."

1331
01:03:19,671 --> 01:03:20,843
She said, "Some other time."
I loved that.

1332
01:03:20,922 --> 01:03:22,344
- Oh, come on.
- The way she said, "Some other time."

1333
01:03:22,424 --> 01:03:23,379
Just socked it right to him.

1334
01:03:23,405 --> 01:03:24,952
All right. Oh, fine,
fine, you made your...

1335
01:03:25,010 --> 01:03:26,432
- Some other time.
- Yes, enough already. That's enough.

1336
01:03:26,511 --> 01:03:28,513
That was pretty witty.
What makes you think she likes him?

1337
01:03:28,596 --> 01:03:29,768
- That's so annoying.
- What makes me...

1338
01:03:29,848 --> 01:03:32,049
Didn't you see the way
she was staring at him all night?

1339
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:33,317
She was staring at him all night.

1340
01:03:33,393 --> 01:03:34,940
She probably can't believe her eyes.
I stare at the guy.

1341
01:03:35,020 --> 01:03:37,239
No, come on.
You wouldn't pick up on those things

1342
01:03:37,314 --> 01:03:38,315
if they hit you over the head.

1343
01:03:38,398 --> 01:03:40,696
You're not the least bit
romantic, and that's the problem.

1344
01:03:40,775 --> 01:03:44,075
Hey, honey, you're the one who
stopped sleeping with me, okay?

1345
01:03:44,154 --> 01:03:45,952
It'll be a year come April 20th.

1346
01:03:46,031 --> 01:03:48,659
I remember the date exactly
'cause it was Hitler's birthday.

1347
01:03:48,742 --> 01:03:49,868
I'm not discussing that anymore.

1348
01:03:49,951 --> 01:03:51,328
I don't want to talk
about it, all right?

1349
01:03:51,411 --> 01:03:52,754
It's just enough about that.
Meantime, I'll bet you,

1350
01:03:52,829 --> 01:03:54,331
she's out having a drink
with him right now.

1351
01:03:54,414 --> 01:03:55,381
For how much?

1352
01:03:55,457 --> 01:03:57,459
For how... I'm serious.
For how much, huh?

1353
01:03:57,542 --> 01:03:59,385
You really know how to get my goat.

1354
01:04:25,695 --> 01:04:27,368
Hi, it's Clifford.

1355
01:04:27,947 --> 01:04:28,948
Yes, I... I...

1356
01:04:29,032 --> 01:04:31,376
I knew you'd be in.
I just... I just wanted, you know...

1357
01:04:31,451 --> 01:04:32,703
Tonight was a lot of fun.

1358
01:04:32,786 --> 01:04:34,914
Wasn't Lester so silly?

1359
01:04:35,205 --> 01:04:37,879
I mean, the guy is so self-important.
He was pushing all night.

1360
01:04:37,957 --> 01:04:41,336
The guy presses. I was... I was
frankly embarrassed for him.

1361
01:04:43,922 --> 01:04:46,721
What is he doing there?

1362
01:04:50,011 --> 01:04:53,140
What do you mean, you're talking
business at 12:00 midnight?

1363
01:04:54,766 --> 01:04:55,767
Well...

1364
01:04:55,975 --> 01:04:57,397
Gee, that could be very dangerous.

1365
01:04:57,477 --> 01:05:00,026
You, you want me to...
You want me to come over?

1366
01:05:03,066 --> 01:05:06,320
Oh, okay, if you, you...
if you can handle it.

1367
01:05:08,029 --> 01:05:11,158
Okay. Okay.
I'll see you tomorrow.

1368
01:05:19,666 --> 01:05:21,543
I'm completely in love with Halley,

1369
01:05:21,626 --> 01:05:24,220
and Lester is starting
to make his move. I can see it.

1370
01:05:24,295 --> 01:05:27,094
And he, he wants it just
for conquest. I can tell.

1371
01:05:27,173 --> 01:05:29,642
You know, it's so shallow
and I'm crazy about her.

1372
01:05:29,717 --> 01:05:32,186
You know, and how can I compete
with the guy because he's rich

1373
01:05:32,262 --> 01:05:34,222
- and he's famous, he's successful.
- Oh, come on,

1374
01:05:34,264 --> 01:05:36,107
he's no competition for you.

1375
01:05:36,182 --> 01:05:38,302
Oh, God bless you for saying
that, sweetheart, really.

1376
01:05:38,351 --> 01:05:40,231
You know, but you'll find
as you go through life

1377
01:05:40,311 --> 01:05:43,235
that, that great depth
and, and smoldering sensuality

1378
01:05:43,314 --> 01:05:45,658
does not always win.
I'm sorry to say.

1379
01:05:45,733 --> 01:05:47,906
Meanwhile, his brother Ben,
you know, Ben the rabbi?

1380
01:05:47,986 --> 01:05:49,659
He's a wonderful guy.

1381
01:05:49,737 --> 01:05:51,956
The poor guy called me last night.
He's going blind.

1382
01:05:52,031 --> 01:05:53,749
He's got a terrible eye disease

1383
01:05:53,825 --> 01:05:55,042
and he's losing his sight.

1384
01:05:55,118 --> 01:05:56,758
He's gonna be blind in
another few months.

1385
01:05:56,828 --> 01:05:59,547
And he's got a great attitude.
He's really a mensch.

1386
01:06:00,999 --> 01:06:02,842
All right. Look left.

1387
01:06:03,710 --> 01:06:05,383
Now, straight ahead, Ben.

1388
01:06:08,131 --> 01:06:09,758
Now, to the right.

1389
01:06:10,550 --> 01:06:12,052
That's good.

1390
01:06:19,809 --> 01:06:21,561
My mother said

1391
01:06:22,353 --> 01:06:23,980
that I should go to the doctor.

1392
01:06:24,063 --> 01:06:25,280
Uh-huh.

1393
01:06:25,356 --> 01:06:27,905
'Cause I was, you know,
my eyes weren't so good.

1394
01:06:27,984 --> 01:06:30,863
- Well, you're an ophthalmologist.
- Yeah.

1395
01:06:30,945 --> 01:06:34,074
Do you agree the eyes
are the windows of the soul?

1396
01:06:34,157 --> 01:06:36,000
Well, I believe they're windows,

1397
01:06:36,075 --> 01:06:38,169
but I'm not sure it's
the soul they see.

1398
01:06:38,369 --> 01:06:40,588
My mother taught me I have a soul.

1399
01:06:41,164 --> 01:06:44,008
And it will live on after
me when I'm gone.

1400
01:06:44,667 --> 01:06:47,136
And if you look deeply
enough in my eyes,

1401
01:06:47,462 --> 01:06:49,009
you can see it.

1402
01:06:49,756 --> 01:06:50,757
Hmm.

1403
01:06:53,301 --> 01:06:54,848
<i>So what's the verdict?</i>

1404
01:06:55,970 --> 01:06:59,144
Look, I'd like to get this resolved
before my daughter's wedding.

1405
01:07:00,934 --> 01:07:02,652
Judy is getting married?

1406
01:07:02,727 --> 01:07:04,946
Time passes quickly, doesn't it?

1407
01:07:05,146 --> 01:07:06,864
Remember, she was just a baby?

1408
01:07:06,940 --> 01:07:08,613
Well, yours, too.

1409
01:07:10,443 --> 01:07:11,444
Yes.

1410
01:07:11,945 --> 01:07:13,538
Are you okay, Judah?

1411
01:07:13,613 --> 01:07:15,286
- Oh, yeah.
- You don't look so good.

1412
01:07:15,365 --> 01:07:18,539
I'm fine. I, I just haven't
been sleeping that well.

1413
01:07:19,285 --> 01:07:21,583
Tell me, if I'm not prying,

1414
01:07:21,663 --> 01:07:24,257
did you ever resolve
your personal difficulties?

1415
01:07:25,333 --> 01:07:27,381
Uh, yes, actually, uh...

1416
01:07:28,211 --> 01:07:30,714
Resolved itself.
The woman listened to reason.

1417
01:07:30,797 --> 01:07:32,140
Did she?

1418
01:07:32,757 --> 01:07:35,180
That's wonderful.
So you got a break.

1419
01:07:36,219 --> 01:07:38,017
Sometimes to have a
little good luck

1420
01:07:38,096 --> 01:07:40,064
is the most brilliant plan.

1421
01:07:40,974 --> 01:07:43,068
Judah, relax. You're white.

1422
01:07:43,142 --> 01:07:45,019
You're gonna have a break down.
It's over.

1423
01:07:45,103 --> 01:07:47,606
What do you expect
me to be, my old self?

1424
01:07:47,689 --> 01:07:49,441
I jump when the phone rings.

1425
01:07:50,149 --> 01:07:51,401
No good can come of this, Jack.

1426
01:07:51,484 --> 01:07:54,203
Hey, don't be so guilty.
I kept you uninvolved.

1427
01:07:54,362 --> 01:07:57,662
The guy who's responsible is gone.
He's back in New Orleans.

1428
01:07:57,907 --> 01:07:59,750
It's pure evil, Jack.

1429
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:02,913
A man kills for money.
He doesn't even know his victims.

1430
01:08:02,996 --> 01:08:04,168
I mean,

1431
01:08:04,581 --> 01:08:08,051
he kills, you pay him,
and he, he kills again.

1432
01:08:08,126 --> 01:08:09,844
Hey, what was your alternative?

1433
01:08:10,962 --> 01:08:12,930
How did I get in so deep?
I...

1434
01:08:14,799 --> 01:08:16,927
What dream was I following?

1435
01:08:17,635 --> 01:08:19,763
Judah, you said it
yourself a million times.

1436
01:08:19,846 --> 01:08:21,940
You only go around once.

1437
01:08:23,308 --> 01:08:25,606
Jack, I went to her place after.

1438
01:08:26,185 --> 01:08:28,563
I had to retrieve some
incriminating things. I...

1439
01:08:29,939 --> 01:08:31,282
I saw her there.

1440
01:08:32,775 --> 01:08:35,654
Just staring up, an inert object.

1441
01:08:37,697 --> 01:08:39,040
There's nothing in...

1442
01:08:39,616 --> 01:08:41,289
Behind her eyes if you
looked into them.

1443
01:08:41,367 --> 01:08:43,210
All you saw

1444
01:08:44,037 --> 01:08:45,584
was a black void.

1445
01:09:22,283 --> 01:09:23,660
Can I help you?

1446
01:09:23,743 --> 01:09:24,915
Oh, uh.

1447
01:09:26,287 --> 01:09:28,710
I used to live in this house once.

1448
01:09:29,123 --> 01:09:30,841
Really? When?

1449
01:09:32,168 --> 01:09:33,715
Many years ago.

1450
01:09:35,963 --> 01:09:38,842
My brother and I used to
race through these rooms.

1451
01:09:40,176 --> 01:09:42,520
He was a wonderful kid, my brother.

1452
01:09:42,595 --> 01:09:44,939
We were very close in those days.

1453
01:09:48,059 --> 01:09:50,938
My father had high hopes
for him, but it never seemed

1454
01:09:51,729 --> 01:09:53,231
to work out for him.

1455
01:09:53,314 --> 01:09:54,611
Oh.

1456
01:09:57,694 --> 01:09:59,696
Would you mind if I
just take a minute?

1457
01:09:59,779 --> 01:10:02,908
I mean, everything seems
to be flooding through me.

1458
01:10:02,990 --> 01:10:04,037
Sure.

1459
01:10:26,472 --> 01:10:28,065
Come on, Sol, get on with it.

1460
01:10:28,141 --> 01:10:29,267
I'm hungry.

1461
01:10:29,392 --> 01:10:31,235
- Do you mind, May?
- This is such nonsense, anyway.

1462
01:10:31,310 --> 01:10:33,312
What are you putting everyone
through this mumbo-jumbo?

1463
01:10:33,396 --> 01:10:34,568
Bring on the main course.

1464
01:10:34,647 --> 01:10:37,400
I apologize for my
disrespectful sister.

1465
01:10:37,692 --> 01:10:40,992
This is the 20th century.
You have young boys sitting here.

1466
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:42,671
Don't fill their heads
with superstition.

1467
01:10:42,739 --> 01:10:45,083
Oh, the intellectual.
The schoolteacher.

1468
01:10:45,158 --> 01:10:48,628
Spare us your, your, your
Leninist philosophy just this once.

1469
01:10:48,703 --> 01:10:51,172
What, you're afraid if you don't obey
the rules, God's gonna punish you?

1470
01:10:51,247 --> 01:10:53,215
He won't punish me, May.
He punishes the wicked.

1471
01:10:53,291 --> 01:10:54,668
Oh, who? Like Hitler?

1472
01:10:54,751 --> 01:10:55,798
How do you say that?

1473
01:10:55,877 --> 01:10:58,756
Six million Jews burnt to death
and he got away with it.

1474
01:10:58,963 --> 01:11:02,263
- How did he get away with it? How?
- Come on, Sol. Open your eyes.

1475
01:11:02,508 --> 01:11:05,853
Six million Jews and millions of
others and they got off with nothing.

1476
01:11:05,928 --> 01:11:07,521
How could human beings
do such a thing?

1477
01:11:07,597 --> 01:11:09,190
Because might makes right.

1478
01:11:09,557 --> 01:11:12,185
That is, until the Americans
marched in and started to...

1479
01:11:12,268 --> 01:11:15,272
- I don't like this talk at my seder.
- Okay, okay, okay, all right.

1480
01:11:15,354 --> 01:11:17,823
- I think this is interesting.
- Yeah, yeah.

1481
01:11:19,192 --> 01:11:20,832
You know, wait a minute.
There's this joke

1482
01:11:20,860 --> 01:11:23,283
about the prizefighter
who enters the ring,

1483
01:11:23,362 --> 01:11:27,117
and his brother turns to the family
priest and says, "Father, pray for him."

1484
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:30,079
And the priest said, "I will,
but if he can punch, it'll help."

1485
01:11:30,161 --> 01:11:31,504
So, what are you saying, May?

1486
01:11:31,829 --> 01:11:34,958
You're saying you challenge the whole
moral structure of everything?

1487
01:11:35,041 --> 01:11:36,338
What moral structure?

1488
01:11:36,709 --> 01:11:39,258
Is that the kind of nonsense
you use on your pupils?

1489
01:11:39,337 --> 01:11:42,807
Do you not find human impulse
is basically decent?

1490
01:11:42,882 --> 01:11:44,509
It's basically nothing.

1491
01:11:44,592 --> 01:11:46,720
Such a cynic,
my sister, a nihilist.

1492
01:11:46,803 --> 01:11:47,895
Go back to Russia.

1493
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:51,270
Well, listen.
I happen to agree with May

1494
01:11:51,390 --> 01:11:53,484
when it comes to all
that mumbo-jumbo.

1495
01:11:53,559 --> 01:11:54,651
How can you say that?

1496
01:11:54,727 --> 01:11:57,571
You come to every seder,
you pray in Hebrew.

1497
01:11:57,730 --> 01:12:00,859
Yes, I'm going through the
motions, just like any ritual.

1498
01:12:00,942 --> 01:12:01,943
It's a habit.

1499
01:12:02,026 --> 01:12:05,747
What are you saying, May? There's no
morality anywhere in the whole world?

1500
01:12:05,905 --> 01:12:08,374
Listen, for those
who want morality, there's morality.

1501
01:12:08,783 --> 01:12:10,706
Nothing's handed down in stones.

1502
01:12:10,785 --> 01:12:13,038
Sol's kind of faith is a gift.

1503
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:16,044
It's like an, an ear for music
or the talent to draw.

1504
01:12:16,123 --> 01:12:18,672
He believes, and you can
use logic on him all day long,

1505
01:12:18,751 --> 01:12:19,843
and he still believes.

1506
01:12:19,919 --> 01:12:21,466
Must everything be logical?

1507
01:12:22,004 --> 01:12:23,005
If a man

1508
01:12:23,631 --> 01:12:25,349
commits a crime, if he...

1509
01:12:25,925 --> 01:12:27,268
If he kills.

1510
01:12:28,803 --> 01:12:31,101
Then one way or another,
he will be punished.

1511
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:32,773
If he's caught, Sol.

1512
01:12:32,849 --> 01:12:35,773
If he's not caught, that which
originates from a black deed

1513
01:12:35,852 --> 01:12:37,274
will blossom in a foul manner.

1514
01:12:37,436 --> 01:12:40,440
Eh, you're relying a little too
heavily on the Bible, Sol.

1515
01:12:40,523 --> 01:12:43,197
No, no, no, no. Whether it's the, uh,
the Old Testament or Shakespeare,

1516
01:12:43,276 --> 01:12:44,619
murder will out.

1517
01:12:45,611 --> 01:12:47,158
Who said anything about murder?

1518
01:12:47,738 --> 01:12:48,739
You did.

1519
01:12:51,617 --> 01:12:52,618
Did I?

1520
01:12:55,121 --> 01:12:57,749
And I say, if he can do
it and get away with it,

1521
01:12:58,040 --> 01:13:00,338
and he chooses not to be
bothered by the ethics,

1522
01:13:00,668 --> 01:13:01,669
then he's home free.

1523
01:13:01,794 --> 01:13:04,843
Remember, history is
written by the winners.

1524
01:13:05,339 --> 01:13:06,761
And if the Nazis had won,

1525
01:13:06,841 --> 01:13:08,388
future generations would understand

1526
01:13:08,467 --> 01:13:11,061
the story of World War
ll quite differently.

1527
01:13:11,137 --> 01:13:13,014
Your aunt is a
brilliant woman, Judah,

1528
01:13:13,097 --> 01:13:14,974
but she's had a very unhappy life.

1529
01:13:15,433 --> 01:13:18,232
- And if all your faith is wrong, Sol.
- Yeah...

1530
01:13:18,311 --> 01:13:20,939
I mean, just what if, huh?
If, hmm?

1531
01:13:21,022 --> 01:13:24,117
Then I'll still have a better life
than all of those that doubt.

1532
01:13:24,191 --> 01:13:25,488
Wait a minute?

1533
01:13:25,568 --> 01:13:28,242
Are you telling me that you
prefer God to the truth?

1534
01:13:28,321 --> 01:13:31,575
If necessary, I will always
choose God over truth.

1535
01:13:31,657 --> 01:13:32,749
I agree with him.

1536
01:13:34,327 --> 01:13:36,830
I say, what goes around,
comes around.

1537
01:13:41,167 --> 01:13:43,795
- Oh, are you okay?
- Yes.

1538
01:13:43,878 --> 01:13:45,846
- I was worried. It's late.
- I had some business.

1539
01:13:46,422 --> 01:13:47,924
- Mrs. Ames is waiting.
- Yeah.

1540
01:13:48,090 --> 01:13:50,684
- Any messages?
- Yeah, you got an odd one.

1541
01:13:50,843 --> 01:13:54,143
A Detective O'Donnell called and said he
wanted to talk to you about something.

1542
01:13:54,221 --> 01:13:55,894
Well, I tried to get
him to tell me what,

1543
01:13:55,973 --> 01:13:58,146
but he said he only
wants to talk with you.

1544
01:14:02,396 --> 01:14:04,114
<i>He says, murder, he says</i>

1545
01:14:04,190 --> 01:14:06,739
<i>Every time we kiss,
he says, murder, he says</i>

1546
01:14:06,817 --> 01:14:09,570
<i>Keep it up like this
and that murder he says</i>

1547
01:14:09,654 --> 01:14:12,032
<i>In that impossible tone</i>

1548
01:14:12,156 --> 01:14:17,003
<i>Will bring on nobody's
murder but his own</i>

1549
01:14:18,704 --> 01:14:21,298
That was not such a great
movie, but, but, you know, it's fun.

1550
01:14:21,374 --> 01:14:22,375
Yeah, I liked it.

1551
01:14:22,541 --> 01:14:24,964
I think maybe when I'm older
I wanna be an actress.

1552
01:14:25,044 --> 01:14:26,405
I don't want you to be an actress.

1553
01:14:26,420 --> 01:14:28,388
I want you to be on the Supreme Court

1554
01:14:28,464 --> 01:14:29,716
or a doctor or something.

1555
01:14:29,799 --> 01:14:32,427
You know, show business
is, is dog eat dog.

1556
01:14:32,510 --> 01:14:34,057
It's worse than dog eat dog.

1557
01:14:34,136 --> 01:14:36,309
It's, it's dog doesn't return
other dog's phone calls.

1558
01:14:36,389 --> 01:14:37,606
You know, which is terrible.

1559
01:14:37,682 --> 01:14:39,730
Which reminds me,
I should really check my service.

1560
01:14:39,809 --> 01:14:42,688
Although I don't know why. I haven't had
a message in seven years, you know?

1561
01:14:42,770 --> 01:14:45,023
I call up and I hear the girls
on the other end giggling.

1562
01:14:45,106 --> 01:14:47,325
- Oh, how's Halley?
- She's great.

1563
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:48,572
I'm going to make my move there,

1564
01:14:48,651 --> 01:14:49,732
- I think, you know?
- Yeah.

1565
01:14:49,735 --> 01:14:51,487
But I have this ethical dilemma
'cause I'm married.

1566
01:14:51,696 --> 01:14:54,074
- Yeah.
- But you shouldn't know about that.

1567
01:14:54,156 --> 01:14:56,375
Clifford Stern. Any messages?
Can you check, please?

1568
01:14:56,784 --> 01:14:59,537
Yeah, my, my heart says one thing,
my head says something else, you know?

1569
01:14:59,620 --> 01:15:02,043
Very, very hard to get your heart
and head together in life.

1570
01:15:02,123 --> 01:15:03,670
Let me teach you that, you know.

1571
01:15:03,749 --> 01:15:05,501
In my case,
they're not even friendly.

1572
01:15:05,710 --> 01:15:06,711
Yes?

1573
01:15:11,048 --> 01:15:12,049
Really?

1574
01:15:18,097 --> 01:15:19,098
No.

1575
01:15:22,059 --> 01:15:23,151
Okay, thank you.

1576
01:15:27,064 --> 01:15:28,065
What's wrong?

1577
01:15:31,652 --> 01:15:35,623
Professor Levy committed suicide.

1578
01:15:37,491 --> 01:15:41,496
<i>But we must always remember that we,</i>

1579
01:15:41,746 --> 01:15:43,714
<i>when we are born,</i>

1580
01:15:43,789 --> 01:15:46,633
<i>we need a great deal of love</i>

1581
01:15:46,709 --> 01:15:50,259
<i>in order to persuade
us to stay in life.</i>

1582
01:15:50,421 --> 01:15:52,640
<i>Once we get that love...</i>

1583
01:15:52,798 --> 01:15:54,399
<i>...it usually lasts us.</i>

1584
01:15:54,467 --> 01:15:57,095
<i>But the universe is a
pretty cold place.</i>

1585
01:15:57,178 --> 01:16:00,603
<i>It's we who invest it
with our feelings.</i>

1586
01:16:01,015 --> 01:16:03,484
<i>And under certain conditions,</i>

1587
01:16:03,851 --> 01:16:05,148
<i>we feel</i>

1588
01:16:05,269 --> 01:16:07,488
<i>that the thing isn't
worth it anymore.</i>

1589
01:16:07,772 --> 01:16:09,740
I came as soon as I heard.

1590
01:16:09,815 --> 01:16:11,738
I... I thought
you might not want to be alone.

1591
01:16:11,817 --> 01:16:13,785
Oh, God.
It's been terrible, you know.

1592
01:16:13,861 --> 01:16:17,115
I called...
The guy was not sick at all.

1593
01:16:17,198 --> 01:16:19,292
And he left a note, he left a
simple, little note that said,

1594
01:16:19,366 --> 01:16:20,743
"I've gone out the window."

1595
01:16:20,826 --> 01:16:23,750
I mean, this is a major intellectual,
and, and this is his note.

1596
01:16:23,829 --> 01:16:24,910
"I've gone out the window."

1597
01:16:24,955 --> 01:16:26,172
I mean, what the hell
does that mean, you know?

1598
01:16:26,248 --> 01:16:28,768
This guy was a role model.
You'd think he'd leave a decent note.

1599
01:16:28,834 --> 01:16:31,633
What... Did he...
Did he have family or anything?

1600
01:16:31,712 --> 01:16:33,840
No. You know, they were
all killed in the war.

1601
01:16:33,923 --> 01:16:35,140
That's what's so
strange about this.

1602
01:16:35,216 --> 01:16:37,685
He... He's seen the worst
side of life his whole life.

1603
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:40,309
He always was affirmative,
always said yes to life. Yes, yes.

1604
01:16:40,387 --> 01:16:41,604
Now, today he said, "no."

1605
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:43,273
Boy, can you imagine his students?

1606
01:16:43,349 --> 01:16:45,272
Imagine how shattered
they're gonna be?

1607
01:16:45,351 --> 01:16:46,773
Listen, I don't know
from suicide, you know.

1608
01:16:46,852 --> 01:16:49,776
Where I grew up in Brooklyn,
nobody committed suicide.

1609
01:16:49,855 --> 01:16:51,357
You know, everyone was too unhappy.

1610
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:53,863
Boy, you know,
this will put a damper on the show.

1611
01:16:53,943 --> 01:16:56,696
Well, I got 600,000
feet of film on this guy,

1612
01:16:56,779 --> 01:16:58,781
and he's telling how great
life is and everything.

1613
01:16:58,864 --> 01:17:00,036
And now, you know.

1614
01:17:00,116 --> 01:17:01,495
You know, what am I gonna do?
I'll...

1615
01:17:01,521 --> 01:17:03,190
I'll cut it up and make
it into guitar picks.

1616
01:17:03,244 --> 01:17:06,373
I'm just thinking, I mean,
no matter how elaborate

1617
01:17:06,455 --> 01:17:08,503
a philosophical
system you work out,

1618
01:17:09,083 --> 01:17:10,084
in the end

1619
01:17:10,501 --> 01:17:12,549
it's, it's gotta be incomplete.

1620
01:17:13,129 --> 01:17:14,130
I've been so...

1621
01:17:14,213 --> 01:17:16,307
I've been so annoyed all day.
I'm sorry for seeming cranky.

1622
01:17:16,382 --> 01:17:18,350
- Oh, God. I understand.
- It's really, really... It's gonna be...

1623
01:17:18,425 --> 01:17:19,472
It's gonna be such a blow.

1624
01:17:19,552 --> 01:17:21,395
I just thought you might
want some company.

1625
01:17:24,598 --> 01:17:25,941
No, don't do that.

1626
01:17:27,017 --> 01:17:30,146
It's something that I wanted
to do now for, for weeks.

1627
01:17:30,229 --> 01:17:32,149
- I just want you to know that.
- You're married.

1628
01:17:32,398 --> 01:17:36,528
Yes, I'm married, but, you know,
that's not going to last.

1629
01:17:36,610 --> 01:17:38,078
I mean, you know...

1630
01:17:38,154 --> 01:17:40,782
Well, you know,
I'm... I'm not ready.

1631
01:17:43,117 --> 01:17:45,620
Is there something you're
not telling me? I mean...

1632
01:17:45,953 --> 01:17:47,000
No.

1633
01:17:47,246 --> 01:17:48,372
Is there anybody else?

1634
01:17:48,455 --> 01:17:50,708
I mean, I just don't
want you to tell me it's Lester.

1635
01:17:50,791 --> 01:17:52,589
It's me, it's just me.

1636
01:17:53,085 --> 01:17:57,135
I... I... I guess I haven't
gotten over my divorce yet, you know.

1637
01:17:57,214 --> 01:17:58,761
And also, I feel

1638
01:17:59,425 --> 01:18:01,018
unsettled about my career.

1639
01:18:01,093 --> 01:18:03,016
You don't know this about me
but I'm very ambitious.

1640
01:18:03,095 --> 01:18:04,938
And, you know,
that's an area that I...

1641
01:18:05,055 --> 01:18:06,932
You know,
I'd like to get consolidated.

1642
01:18:07,016 --> 01:18:09,394
And I just feel,
you know, unsettled.

1643
01:18:24,241 --> 01:18:25,959
Don't confuse me.

1644
01:18:26,035 --> 01:18:27,833
I'm not trying to confuse you.

1645
01:18:27,912 --> 01:18:29,334
I don't know what I'm doing.

1646
01:18:30,623 --> 01:18:33,718
I better go.
I should just leave.

1647
01:18:33,792 --> 01:18:37,046
- You just got here.
- Yeah, I know, but I... You know...

1648
01:18:37,129 --> 01:18:39,810
- Gee, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...
- No, that's okay. It's not...

1649
01:18:40,216 --> 01:18:43,470
I'll see you soon. I'll just...
You know, I'll be seeing you.

1650
01:18:47,890 --> 01:18:49,483
Please come in.

1651
01:18:50,893 --> 01:18:52,566
Uh, we read about it in the paper.

1652
01:18:52,645 --> 01:18:54,818
It's... It's a terrible thing.

1653
01:18:55,606 --> 01:18:57,767
You know, she'd been coming
here for several years now.

1654
01:18:57,816 --> 01:18:59,159
- Please sit down.
- Thank you.

1655
01:19:00,653 --> 01:19:02,451
Just a couple of questions, Doctor.

1656
01:19:02,613 --> 01:19:05,162
The record shows that
she phoned you here

1657
01:19:05,241 --> 01:19:07,664
- and at your home a number of times.
- Mmm-hmm.

1658
01:19:08,327 --> 01:19:09,704
She was worried about her eyes.

1659
01:19:10,162 --> 01:19:12,039
What was she suffering from?

1660
01:19:12,122 --> 01:19:14,295
Nothing serious, I mean, she, um,

1661
01:19:14,833 --> 01:19:17,427
she had light flashes
and they alarmed her.

1662
01:19:17,503 --> 01:19:19,631
And I could never find anything
very wrong with her, but, uh...

1663
01:19:19,838 --> 01:19:22,967
And I told her that, you know, it was
just a common occurrence.

1664
01:19:23,050 --> 01:19:24,597
She was a hypochondriac?

1665
01:19:24,677 --> 01:19:28,147
No, no. I wouldn't say that,
but she was concerned.

1666
01:19:29,390 --> 01:19:30,892
And there's nothing she ever said

1667
01:19:30,975 --> 01:19:32,735
that you think might be
relevant to the case?

1668
01:19:32,810 --> 01:19:34,858
Uh, personal life, friends?

1669
01:19:35,271 --> 01:19:36,818
No, not really.

1670
01:19:37,856 --> 01:19:39,483
How did she come to you?

1671
01:19:41,694 --> 01:19:43,446
You know, I honestly can't remember.

1672
01:19:43,862 --> 01:19:45,409
Possibly another patient.

1673
01:19:45,489 --> 01:19:46,911
Can I get that name?

1674
01:19:47,157 --> 01:19:50,127
Well, it was a while ago and I... I...
I treat so many patients.

1675
01:19:50,577 --> 01:19:52,045
Might it be in your records?

1676
01:19:53,163 --> 01:19:56,337
No, no, no. I...
I doubt it very much.

1677
01:19:57,835 --> 01:20:00,155
- Well, I'm sorry to take up your time.
- That's all right.

1678
01:20:01,005 --> 01:20:03,849
If you, uh, remember anything
you think might be helpful,

1679
01:20:03,924 --> 01:20:05,517
- will you give me a call?
- Sure.

1680
01:20:05,843 --> 01:20:07,186
- Thank you.
- Pleasure.

1681
01:20:17,771 --> 01:20:19,944
For Christ's sake, Judah,
you're having a breakdown.

1682
01:20:20,024 --> 01:20:21,424
The police know
she phoned me a lot.

1683
01:20:21,483 --> 01:20:23,281
I lied, but I know
they saw through it.

1684
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:25,237
I can't take this, Jack.
This is not for me.

1685
01:20:25,321 --> 01:20:26,322
If you don't pull yourself together,

1686
01:20:26,405 --> 01:20:27,452
you're gonna blow the whole thing.

1687
01:20:27,531 --> 01:20:30,080
Well, I did it, and it's irrevocable,
and now I'm gonna pay.

1688
01:20:30,159 --> 01:20:33,288
Jack, I had to fight an urge just to
make a clean breast of it to the police.

1689
01:20:33,370 --> 01:20:34,496
I want this off my mind.

1690
01:20:34,580 --> 01:20:36,833
Listen to me, Judah,
I'm in this with you.

1691
01:20:36,915 --> 01:20:39,213
I helped you out
and I don't wanna go to jail for it.

1692
01:20:39,293 --> 01:20:41,091
Now, you get these
ideas about confessing

1693
01:20:41,170 --> 01:20:43,172
and you may not care
whether you drag me down with you.

1694
01:20:43,255 --> 01:20:45,758
But I'm telling you right now,
I'm not gonna let that happen.

1695
01:20:46,258 --> 01:20:47,601
What the hell is that,
Jack, a threat?

1696
01:20:47,676 --> 01:20:49,929
Just pull yourself together and
be a man. You're in the clear.

1697
01:20:50,012 --> 01:20:51,355
What, are you gonna have me
rubbed out, too?

1698
01:20:51,430 --> 01:20:52,431
Don't talk nonsense.

1699
01:20:52,514 --> 01:20:53,811
Look, I wanna know what
you meant by that remark,

1700
01:20:53,891 --> 01:20:55,313
"You won't let it happen."
What did you mean by that?

1701
01:20:55,392 --> 01:20:57,861
You're my brother. You've helped me
out in the past, financially.

1702
01:20:57,936 --> 01:21:00,439
Fine. I did you a favor
when you needed it, all right?

1703
01:21:00,522 --> 01:21:02,616
Now all of a sudden
you get this urge to confess?

1704
01:21:02,691 --> 01:21:04,910
The time to confess was to Miriam,
about your mistress.

1705
01:21:04,985 --> 01:21:07,363
Not about this. This is murder.

1706
01:21:07,446 --> 01:21:09,073
You paid for it, I engineered it,

1707
01:21:09,156 --> 01:21:11,375
and it's over, all right?
So forget about it!

1708
01:21:12,242 --> 01:21:14,244
One sin leads to a deeper sin.

1709
01:21:14,328 --> 01:21:15,705
Now you sound like Papa.

1710
01:21:15,788 --> 01:21:19,383
Adultery, fornication,
lies, killing.

1711
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:20,877
Judah, will you shut up already?

1712
01:21:20,959 --> 01:21:22,757
Or what? You'll have your
friends shut me up?

1713
01:21:22,836 --> 01:21:25,134
One phone call, like
pushing a button, right?

1714
01:22:02,543 --> 01:22:04,420
Judah, I don't know what's
wrong with you these days.

1715
01:22:04,503 --> 01:22:06,005
You're a different person.

1716
01:22:07,506 --> 01:22:09,349
I believe in God, Miriam.

1717
01:22:10,426 --> 01:22:11,848
I know it.

1718
01:22:13,220 --> 01:22:15,348
Because without God,
the world is a cesspool.

1719
01:22:15,431 --> 01:22:17,058
You've been drinking
steadily and every day.

1720
01:22:17,141 --> 01:22:20,395
You never used to drink like this.
It's something new.

1721
01:22:20,561 --> 01:22:21,778
God, it's hot in here.

1722
01:22:21,854 --> 01:22:23,231
Well, maybe we should go, Dad.

1723
01:22:23,313 --> 01:22:24,610
Don't tell me what I
should do, damn it!

1724
01:22:24,690 --> 01:22:26,283
- Judah, will you calm down?
- Dad!

1725
01:22:27,734 --> 01:22:28,735
What the...

1726
01:22:29,445 --> 01:22:30,742
I don't... I don't feel well.

1727
01:22:30,821 --> 01:22:32,382
I'm gonna get a little air.

1728
01:22:32,448 --> 01:22:34,121
- Well, I...
- No, you stay here.

1729
01:22:58,348 --> 01:23:00,316
<i>All right, look. This, uh,
this story on the homeless,</i>

1730
01:23:00,392 --> 01:23:01,985
<i>it's too long.
I want five pages out of it.</i>

1731
01:23:02,060 --> 01:23:04,154
<i>Make sure he gets five
real pages out of it.</i>

1732
01:23:04,229 --> 01:23:06,482
<i>This guy tells his secretary
to type it tighter.</i>

1733
01:23:06,565 --> 01:23:08,158
<i>He doesn't take anything out of it.
It's stupid.</i>

1734
01:23:08,233 --> 01:23:09,993
<i>And I want this guy,
Johansson, off the show.</i>

1735
01:23:10,027 --> 01:23:11,825
<i>He's not funny.
He doesn't write funny, I'm sick.</i>

1736
01:23:11,904 --> 01:23:14,327
<i>He has cancer. I'm sorry. I'll
send him flowers. He's not funny.</i>

1737
01:23:14,406 --> 01:23:15,686
<i>I don't want him.
I want him off.</i>

1738
01:23:15,741 --> 01:23:18,221
<i>Jesus! Doesn't anybody
know how to write funny anymore?</i>

1739
01:23:18,285 --> 01:23:19,878
<i>I mean, what,
what am I supposed to do?</i>

1740
01:23:19,953 --> 01:23:21,296
<i>Am I supposed to write
everything myself?</i>

1741
01:23:21,371 --> 01:23:23,874
<i>Write it myself, direct it
myself, produce it myself?</i>

1742
01:23:23,957 --> 01:23:25,334
<i>I can't believe this!
Look at this!</i>

1743
01:23:25,417 --> 01:23:26,964
<i>Look at those people out there!
Look at 'em!</i>

1744
01:23:27,044 --> 01:23:28,341
<i>Look out the window at them!</i>

1745
01:23:28,420 --> 01:23:30,889
<i>These people are looking
for something funny in their lives!</i>

1746
01:23:30,964 --> 01:23:32,011
<i>They're not getting anything funny!</i>

1747
01:23:32,090 --> 01:23:33,307
<i>You're giving them straight lines!</i>

1748
01:23:33,383 --> 01:23:35,135
<i>Their lives are
straight lines already.</i>

1749
01:23:35,219 --> 01:23:36,619
<i>They're waiting for
something funny!</i>

1750
01:23:54,863 --> 01:23:56,365
This is terrible.

1751
01:23:56,907 --> 01:23:58,409
What are you doing to me?

1752
01:23:59,117 --> 01:24:01,961
This is supposed to be the
profile of a creative mind.

1753
01:24:02,287 --> 01:24:04,335
<i>It's very tough for a woman
in this profession.</i>

1754
01:24:04,414 --> 01:24:05,757
<i>I mean,
men are always hitting on you.</i>

1755
01:24:05,832 --> 01:24:07,459
<i>I can make it easier for you...</i>

1756
01:24:07,543 --> 01:24:10,513
What is this? What is this? When did you
shoot that? When did you get that?

1757
01:24:10,587 --> 01:24:12,009
I was lurking
around the corner.

1758
01:24:12,089 --> 01:24:14,467
I had my camera and I,
I couldn't resist. I saw you guys.

1759
01:24:14,550 --> 01:24:16,644
<i>I don't wanna do it in
a kind of a vulgar way,</i>

1760
01:24:16,718 --> 01:24:19,722
<i>and just, uh, well, you know,
take it off from what I see here.</i>

1761
01:24:19,805 --> 01:24:21,899
<i>I wanna find out what's
in here, so I gotta,</i>

1762
01:24:21,974 --> 01:24:24,944
<i>you know, spend some time,
we 'II have dinner together...</i>

1763
01:24:26,186 --> 01:24:28,780
Okay, you can step aside.
I'm taking over this film.

1764
01:24:28,855 --> 01:24:31,153
What're you talking about?
You can't finish my film.

1765
01:24:31,233 --> 01:24:32,610
I can't?
Read your contract.

1766
01:24:32,693 --> 01:24:33,990
You promised.

1767
01:24:34,069 --> 01:24:36,117
Look, the idea was
to show the real me.

1768
01:24:36,196 --> 01:24:37,676
All right, okay,
I may not be perfect.

1769
01:24:37,698 --> 01:24:39,496
But I don't promote
values that help...

1770
01:24:39,575 --> 01:24:41,919
That... That... Wait, let me
get your quote exactly.

1771
01:24:41,994 --> 01:24:44,838
"That deaden the sensibilities
of a great democracy."

1772
01:24:44,913 --> 01:24:47,541
You're fired, Cliff. You're fired!
You're out! Get out of here!

1773
01:24:47,624 --> 01:24:49,092
Go! Thank you! Goodbye.

1774
01:24:50,502 --> 01:24:54,678
<i>If it bends, it's funny.
If it breaks, it isn't.</i>

1775
01:24:55,507 --> 01:24:57,601
Come on, now, don't get discouraged.

1776
01:24:57,676 --> 01:24:59,428
You have your own personal vision.

1777
01:24:59,511 --> 01:25:01,138
What is the guy so upset about?

1778
01:25:01,221 --> 01:25:03,269
You'd think nobody was ever
compared to Mussolini before.

1779
01:25:03,348 --> 01:25:06,443
God, I had no idea you were
gonna cut the film like this.

1780
01:25:06,518 --> 01:25:09,112
I could have told you months
ago they'd never use it.

1781
01:25:09,313 --> 01:25:11,657
They want an upbeat profile of Lester.
They like him.

1782
01:25:11,732 --> 01:25:15,282
Yeah. Now he's gonna take it and recut it
and make himself into a saint or something.

1783
01:25:15,402 --> 01:25:16,449
- Yeah.
- You know, Wendy's right.

1784
01:25:16,528 --> 01:25:17,649
I'm probably jealous of him.

1785
01:25:17,696 --> 01:25:20,745
You now, with his limos and his money and
all the women throw themselves...

1786
01:25:20,824 --> 01:25:22,201
You have your own style.

1787
01:25:22,409 --> 01:25:24,377
Hey, listen, marry me.
I'm serious. I'm...

1788
01:25:24,453 --> 01:25:26,751
That's the only thing
that will satisfy me. Marry me.

1789
01:25:26,830 --> 01:25:28,548
I'm crazy about you, you're single,

1790
01:25:28,624 --> 01:25:30,126
and you know my marriage
is not gonna last.

1791
01:25:30,208 --> 01:25:31,551
Look, I gotta talk to you.

1792
01:25:31,627 --> 01:25:34,005
Can we just...
Can we sit down here for a second?

1793
01:25:34,087 --> 01:25:37,216
I'm... I'm not joking, you know.
I'm... I'm really nuts about you.

1794
01:25:37,299 --> 01:25:38,846
I'm going away.

1795
01:25:41,553 --> 01:25:43,396
Yeah? Meaning what?

1796
01:25:44,556 --> 01:25:49,187
I've got a chance to produce
a couple of shows in London,

1797
01:25:49,394 --> 01:25:51,567
and, you know, I couldn't say no.

1798
01:25:53,065 --> 01:25:55,488
So, how...
How long are you going for?

1799
01:25:55,692 --> 01:25:58,411
Well, probably three
or four months.

1800
01:25:58,570 --> 01:26:00,618
Three or four months?

1801
01:26:01,239 --> 01:26:04,243
Jesus, you're kidding.

1802
01:26:04,326 --> 01:26:06,454
What a...
What a discouraging thought.

1803
01:26:06,536 --> 01:26:08,664
But, you know,
I think it's a good thing

1804
01:26:08,747 --> 01:26:10,875
because I... I need...

1805
01:26:10,957 --> 01:26:13,506
Well, it will give me
a little distance.

1806
01:26:13,585 --> 01:26:16,179
About 3,000 miles to be exact.

1807
01:26:16,254 --> 01:26:17,426
When are you leaving?

1808
01:26:17,506 --> 01:26:20,134
Oh, I guess, you now,
10 days or so.

1809
01:26:21,677 --> 01:26:24,601
God, I'm... Oh.

1810
01:26:28,266 --> 01:26:30,940
God, I'm gonna Miss you. I...
You know what? I don't know what to say.

1811
01:26:31,019 --> 01:26:32,271
I'm just...

1812
01:26:33,188 --> 01:26:35,566
I'm not gonna see you
for three or four months?

1813
01:26:37,567 --> 01:26:41,413
I feel like I, you know, like I've
been handed a prison sentence.

1814
01:27:11,476 --> 01:27:13,820
Ben, your daughter will make
a beautiful bride.

1815
01:27:13,895 --> 01:27:15,863
You know, your daughter will...

1816
01:27:15,939 --> 01:27:18,362
This is Barbara, uh,
the sister of my brother-in-law.

1817
01:27:18,442 --> 01:27:19,534
- Hi.
- Carol.

1818
01:27:19,609 --> 01:27:20,986
- Oh.
- Congratulations.

1819
01:27:21,903 --> 01:27:23,871
I wish your daughter
all the happiness.

1820
01:27:23,947 --> 01:27:24,948
Thank you.

1821
01:27:25,365 --> 01:27:26,912
Oh, thank you so much.

1822
01:27:29,202 --> 01:27:31,455
Jesus, I'm so self-conscious.

1823
01:27:31,538 --> 01:27:34,132
You know, every single thing
on me is rented.

1824
01:27:34,207 --> 01:27:37,051
A rented tux, rented shoes,
rented underwear.

1825
01:27:37,127 --> 01:27:39,687
You look fine, you look terrific.
Cliff, would you do me a favor?

1826
01:27:39,713 --> 01:27:42,136
This is the last occasion you have
to do anything with my family.

1827
01:27:42,215 --> 01:27:43,512
Could we try to get along?

1828
01:27:43,967 --> 01:27:46,436
Oh, and this is Dr. Rosenthal.

1829
01:27:46,511 --> 01:27:47,763
I'm Miriam.

1830
01:27:47,846 --> 01:27:48,893
- Hello.
- This is Miriam.

1831
01:27:48,972 --> 01:27:51,145
And this is Marianne,
and this is Peter.

1832
01:27:51,224 --> 01:27:52,476
- How do you do, Peter?
- How do you do?

1833
01:27:52,559 --> 01:27:53,680
It's a pleasure meeting you.

1834
01:27:53,769 --> 01:27:55,612
- Judah?
- Yes, Ben?

1835
01:27:55,979 --> 01:27:59,153
Judah, I'm so glad you could make it.
It means a lot.

1836
01:28:02,319 --> 01:28:05,289
What is the matter with you,
you seem so depressed.

1837
01:28:05,363 --> 01:28:08,537
Wendy and I finally
decided to call it quits, you know.

1838
01:28:08,617 --> 01:28:11,120
And even though the last couple
of years have been terrible...

1839
01:28:11,203 --> 01:28:12,625
- Mmm-hmm.
- ...this kind of thing

1840
01:28:12,704 --> 01:28:14,297
just makes me feel sad, you know.

1841
01:28:14,372 --> 01:28:15,874
I'm... I'm gonna have
a vodka and tonic, please.

1842
01:28:15,957 --> 01:28:17,129
Oh, yeah.
I'll have one of those, too.

1843
01:28:17,209 --> 01:28:18,631
But you know what you told me?

1844
01:28:18,710 --> 01:28:20,804
You told me it's been
platonic for a year.

1845
01:28:20,879 --> 01:28:23,348
And I say once the
sex goes, it all goes.

1846
01:28:23,423 --> 01:28:24,640
It's true. It's true.

1847
01:28:24,716 --> 01:28:26,093
The last time I was inside a woman

1848
01:28:26,176 --> 01:28:28,053
it was when I visited
the Statue of Liberty.

1849
01:28:36,770 --> 01:28:38,568
Take a look at your father.

1850
01:28:38,647 --> 01:28:40,167
He's celebrating enough
for two people.

1851
01:28:40,816 --> 01:28:42,989
Yeah, well, he...
He and Ben will get high

1852
01:28:43,068 --> 01:28:44,695
and then argue about
belief and God.

1853
01:28:44,778 --> 01:28:46,530
My father takes after his Aunt May.

1854
01:28:46,613 --> 01:28:48,661
You'd have loved her.
She rejected the Bible

1855
01:28:48,740 --> 01:28:51,744
because she said it had a completely
unbelievable sense of character.

1856
01:28:52,661 --> 01:28:54,083
I walked ¡n, I sit.

1857
01:28:54,162 --> 01:28:57,507
The Waldorf-Astoria, the centerpieces.
Did you see the centerpieces?

1858
01:28:57,582 --> 01:28:58,674
It's just beautiful.

1859
01:28:58,750 --> 01:29:00,969
Everything matches.
And Lester paid for it.

1860
01:29:01,086 --> 01:29:03,509
It's hard to believe that a
brother would pay for a wedding.

1861
01:29:03,588 --> 01:29:06,842
It's hard to believe but that's the
sort of thing Lester is always doing,

1862
01:29:06,925 --> 01:29:07,972
isn't it?

1863
01:29:08,051 --> 01:29:10,179
- He must be a good brother.
- Do you know him for a long time?

1864
01:29:10,262 --> 01:29:12,356
Since high school.
I've known him since high school.

1865
01:29:12,430 --> 01:29:13,431
Oh, that's wonderful.

1866
01:29:26,611 --> 01:29:28,488
They're pretty.
They're very, very pretty.

1867
01:29:28,572 --> 01:29:29,852
It's very square like that. See?

1868
01:29:29,865 --> 01:29:30,991
Hi, Cliff.

1869
01:29:31,074 --> 01:29:32,371
Cliff, hello.

1870
01:29:32,450 --> 01:29:35,044
Lester, how are you?
Good to see you.

1871
01:29:35,120 --> 01:29:36,400
My fiancée, Halley Reed.

1872
01:29:36,413 --> 01:29:38,211
Congratulations.
My wife Nancy.

1873
01:29:38,290 --> 01:29:39,712
Hello, nice to meet you.

1874
01:29:43,044 --> 01:29:44,512
When did you get back?

1875
01:29:44,796 --> 01:29:47,800
I got back this morning.
I've been trying to call you all day.

1876
01:29:47,883 --> 01:29:50,181
Look at this. Look at this.
I finally won her heart.

1877
01:29:50,302 --> 01:29:52,270
What a romantic story,
you should have seen it.

1878
01:29:52,345 --> 01:29:54,097
We ran into each other in London.

1879
01:29:54,180 --> 01:29:57,650
And I sent her white
roses around the clock.

1880
01:29:57,809 --> 01:29:59,982
All the time, for days, for days.

1881
01:30:00,061 --> 01:30:01,688
And then I found out
she was allergic.

1882
01:30:01,771 --> 01:30:02,863
- Hi, Lester.
- Hi.

1883
01:30:02,939 --> 01:30:04,191
Lester, how are you?
Congratulations.

1884
01:30:04,274 --> 01:30:05,651
Thank you. Good to see you.

1885
01:30:05,734 --> 01:30:08,408
So I... I...
I started pleading with her.

1886
01:30:08,486 --> 01:30:11,160
I just... I begged her.
I just begged her day and night.

1887
01:30:11,239 --> 01:30:13,162
And I think it was the
caviar that did it.

1888
01:30:13,408 --> 01:30:15,877
You know, I've envied...
I've envied you for years.

1889
01:30:15,952 --> 01:30:17,204
I've envied this guy for years.

1890
01:30:17,287 --> 01:30:20,086
I mean, he would show up with a
beautiful woman each and every time.

1891
01:30:20,165 --> 01:30:22,088
But I... But I envy you more now.

1892
01:30:22,167 --> 01:30:23,327
Well, now, thank you.

1893
01:30:23,376 --> 01:30:24,377
Thank you.

1894
01:30:49,945 --> 01:30:52,573
Standing here,
in the presence of God,

1895
01:30:52,697 --> 01:30:54,540
the guardian of our homes,

1896
01:30:54,699 --> 01:30:57,543
ready to enter into the
bonds of wedlock,

1897
01:30:57,619 --> 01:31:01,089
answer each of you in
reverence for God.

1898
01:31:01,164 --> 01:31:04,259
And in the hearing of the assembly
that have gathered here

1899
01:31:04,334 --> 01:31:06,507
so joyously with you.

1900
01:31:15,470 --> 01:31:17,564
- I know the perfect guy for you.
- Who?

1901
01:31:17,639 --> 01:31:19,812
- He's brilliant, he's attractive...
- Well, who is it?

1902
01:31:19,891 --> 01:31:21,689
What? There's a hitch.
I'm waiting.

1903
01:31:21,768 --> 01:31:23,315
There's a hitch, but it
sounds worse than it is.

1904
01:31:23,395 --> 01:31:24,567
What is it? What is it?

1905
01:31:24,646 --> 01:31:25,818
He's in prison.

1906
01:31:25,897 --> 01:31:27,695
Rita, I would say that's a drawback.

1907
01:31:27,774 --> 01:31:30,197
Nothing terrible.
Insider trading.

1908
01:31:30,276 --> 01:31:31,869
- He made a fortune in the market.
- Oh, please.

1909
01:31:31,945 --> 01:31:36,291
And he'll be out soon,
very soon, a couple of years.

1910
01:31:36,366 --> 01:31:37,959
You mean, with good behavior.

1911
01:31:52,007 --> 01:31:53,179
Cliff?

1912
01:31:57,053 --> 01:31:59,021
I wanted to talk to you.

1913
01:32:04,811 --> 01:32:06,172
What is there really to say?

1914
01:32:06,229 --> 01:32:09,574
You know, I'm...
I'm just stunned still.

1915
01:32:12,736 --> 01:32:14,329
He's not what you think.

1916
01:32:15,447 --> 01:32:18,166
He's... He's wonderful, he's warm

1917
01:32:18,241 --> 01:32:19,914
and caring

1918
01:32:19,993 --> 01:32:22,371
and romantic.

1919
01:32:22,454 --> 01:32:24,297
- He's a success. That's what he is.
- Oh.

1920
01:32:24,372 --> 01:32:25,874
He's, he's rich and he's a success.

1921
01:32:25,957 --> 01:32:27,550
Give me a little credit, will you?

1922
01:32:27,625 --> 01:32:30,378
Well, I always did give you
a little credit until today.

1923
01:32:30,462 --> 01:32:31,679
You know, I...

1924
01:32:31,755 --> 01:32:34,349
We used to laugh
at this guy. You know the, uh,

1925
01:32:34,424 --> 01:32:37,018
the silly shows he puts on,
the way he talks.

1926
01:32:37,093 --> 01:32:38,310
He's endearing.

1927
01:32:40,096 --> 01:32:43,066
This is my worst fear realized.

1928
01:32:49,230 --> 01:32:51,324
I wanted to give you
this letter back.

1929
01:32:55,570 --> 01:32:57,038
It's my one love letter.

1930
01:32:57,113 --> 01:32:58,365
It's beautiful.

1931
01:32:58,531 --> 01:33:01,080
I... I'm just the wrong person.

1932
01:33:04,996 --> 01:33:06,748
It's probably just as well.

1933
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,674
I plagiarized most of it
from James Joyce.

1934
01:33:13,588 --> 01:33:16,432
You probably wondered why
all the references to Dublin.

1935
01:33:16,508 --> 01:33:17,760
Look, I...

1936
01:33:18,676 --> 01:33:22,021
I hope we can always be friends.

1937
01:33:29,270 --> 01:33:31,648
Hey! Hey!

1938
01:34:06,599 --> 01:34:08,351
Off by yourself, huh?

1939
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:09,732
You're like me.

1940
01:34:11,104 --> 01:34:13,948
I always get sad at
these kind of events.

1941
01:34:14,315 --> 01:34:16,192
You look very deep in thought.

1942
01:34:19,154 --> 01:34:21,373
I was plotting the perfect murder.

1943
01:34:22,907 --> 01:34:25,285
Yeah? Movie plot?

1944
01:34:26,411 --> 01:34:27,788
Movie?

1945
01:34:28,246 --> 01:34:31,216
Well, Ben, uh,
that's what Ben told me.

1946
01:34:31,291 --> 01:34:33,009
He says you make films.

1947
01:34:33,209 --> 01:34:34,677
Yeah, but not that kind.

1948
01:34:34,752 --> 01:34:37,096
You know, the different kind.

1949
01:34:39,257 --> 01:34:41,385
I have a great murder story.

1950
01:34:42,594 --> 01:34:43,766
Yes?

1951
01:34:43,845 --> 01:34:45,017
A great plot.

1952
01:34:46,139 --> 01:34:47,482
Yeah.

1953
01:34:49,559 --> 01:34:51,561
Hey, I've had too many to drink.

1954
01:34:51,644 --> 01:34:55,274
I hope you'll forgive me.
I... I know you want your privacy.

1955
01:34:55,607 --> 01:34:59,612
No, it's okay.
I'm not doing anything special.

1956
01:35:00,820 --> 01:35:02,572
Except my murder story

1957
01:35:02,655 --> 01:35:05,955
has a very strange twist.

1958
01:35:07,327 --> 01:35:08,704
Yeah?

1959
01:35:11,206 --> 01:35:15,131
Let's say there's this man who...
Who's very successful.

1960
01:35:15,293 --> 01:35:16,795
He has everything.

1961
01:35:24,510 --> 01:35:26,512
- Let me ask you something.
- What?

1962
01:35:26,804 --> 01:35:27,896
Am I a phony?

1963
01:35:27,972 --> 01:35:29,519
- Are you what?
- Am I a phony?

1964
01:35:29,599 --> 01:35:31,897
What are you talking about?
Are you a little high or something?

1965
01:35:31,976 --> 01:35:34,229
No, I'm... You know,
I think he hates me.

1966
01:35:34,312 --> 01:35:35,655
- Who hates you?
- Your annoying husband.

1967
01:35:35,730 --> 01:35:37,198
He's a...
Every time I'm with him

1968
01:35:37,273 --> 01:35:38,900
I get tense, you know.

1969
01:35:38,983 --> 01:35:40,405
It's just that he's angry.
You know that.

1970
01:35:40,485 --> 01:35:41,737
Well, at what?
At what?

1971
01:35:41,819 --> 01:35:42,991
At what?
Are you kidding me?

1972
01:35:43,071 --> 01:35:45,119
He's got these fantasies
about changing the world.

1973
01:35:45,198 --> 01:35:46,415
'Cause he's a man who thinks
he can change it.

1974
01:35:46,491 --> 01:35:48,118
He makes these films,
and in the end they come to nothing.

1975
01:35:48,201 --> 01:35:50,249
- They're nothing, these films.
- Let me tell you something, honey.

1976
01:35:50,328 --> 01:35:52,080
He's gotta grow up.
I mean, this is the real world.

1977
01:35:52,163 --> 01:35:55,123
This is the big time. They don't...
They don't pay off on high aspirations.

1978
01:35:55,166 --> 01:35:57,214
- You gotta deliver, you know.
- You don't have to tell me.

1979
01:35:57,293 --> 01:35:58,920
And not to mention the fact that...

1980
01:35:59,003 --> 01:36:00,084
I mean, I can't believe it.

1981
01:36:00,129 --> 01:36:01,326
You're... You're still young.

1982
01:36:01,352 --> 01:36:03,704
You're not getting the life
that you deserve, you know.

1983
01:36:03,758 --> 01:36:05,135
Lester, I met somebody.

1984
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:07,728
Oh, then... Oh.

1985
01:36:08,763 --> 01:36:11,357
- That is music to my ears.
- Yeah.

1986
01:36:12,809 --> 01:36:14,527
And after the awful deed is done,

1987
01:36:14,602 --> 01:36:18,357
he, he finds that he's plagued
by deep-rooted guilt.

1988
01:36:19,190 --> 01:36:22,364
Little sparks of his
religious background,

1989
01:36:22,652 --> 01:36:24,404
which he'd rejected

1990
01:36:24,570 --> 01:36:26,243
are suddenly stirred up.

1991
01:36:28,283 --> 01:36:30,377
He hears his father's voice.

1992
01:36:30,451 --> 01:36:34,706
He imagines that God
is watching his every move.

1993
01:36:35,665 --> 01:36:37,884
Suddenly, it's not an
empty universe at all,

1994
01:36:37,959 --> 01:36:40,337
but a just and moral one,

1995
01:36:40,420 --> 01:36:43,264
and he's violated it.

1996
01:36:44,757 --> 01:36:46,509
Now, he's panic-stricken.

1997
01:36:47,176 --> 01:36:49,474
He's on the verge of
a mental collapse,

1998
01:36:50,054 --> 01:36:53,934
an inch away from confessing
the whole thing to the police.

1999
01:36:55,393 --> 01:36:58,146
And then one morning,

2000
01:36:58,730 --> 01:37:00,232
he awakens

2001
01:37:01,232 --> 01:37:04,406
and the sun is shining
and his family is around him.

2002
01:37:05,236 --> 01:37:08,991
Mysteriously, the crisis is lifted.

2003
01:37:10,908 --> 01:37:13,036
He takes his family on
a vacation to Europe,

2004
01:37:13,119 --> 01:37:16,840
and as the months pass
he finds he's not punished.

2005
01:37:17,915 --> 01:37:19,417
In fact, he prospers.

2006
01:37:20,418 --> 01:37:22,841
The killing gets attributed
to another person,

2007
01:37:22,920 --> 01:37:25,014
a drifter who has a number of
other murders to his credit.

2008
01:37:25,089 --> 01:37:28,218
So, I mean, what the hell,
one more doesn't even matter.

2009
01:37:29,427 --> 01:37:31,179
Now he's soot-free.

2010
01:37:32,180 --> 01:37:34,979
His life is completely
back to normal.

2011
01:37:35,975 --> 01:37:40,276
Back to his protected world
of wealth and privilege.

2012
01:37:40,813 --> 01:37:43,987
Uh, yes, but can he
ever really go back?

2013
01:37:46,444 --> 01:37:49,539
Well, people carry sins
around with them.

2014
01:37:49,614 --> 01:37:53,164
I mean, oh, maybe once in a while
he has a bad moment,

2015
01:37:53,242 --> 01:37:54,915
but it passes.

2016
01:37:55,703 --> 01:37:58,547
And with time, it all fades.

2017
01:37:59,123 --> 01:38:01,501
Yeah. But, but, so then, you know,

2018
01:38:01,584 --> 01:38:05,259
then, then his worst...
His worst beliefs are realized.

2019
01:38:05,463 --> 01:38:07,966
Well, I said it was a
chilling story, didn't I?

2020
01:38:10,176 --> 01:38:11,223
I don't know.

2021
01:38:11,302 --> 01:38:13,976
It... It'd be... I think it'd be tough
for somebody to live with that.

2022
01:38:14,055 --> 01:38:16,729
You know, it's... Very few
guys could actually live,

2023
01:38:16,808 --> 01:38:19,186
you know, to live with something
like that on their conscience.

2024
01:38:19,268 --> 01:38:21,396
What do you mean? People carry
awful deeds around with them.

2025
01:38:21,479 --> 01:38:24,153
What do you expect him
to do, turn himself in?

2026
01:38:25,149 --> 01:38:26,822
I mean, this is reality.

2027
01:38:27,193 --> 01:38:29,195
In reality, we, we rationalize.

2028
01:38:29,278 --> 01:38:32,452
We deny or we,
we couldn't go on living.

2029
01:38:36,035 --> 01:38:39,414
Here's what I would do.
I would have him turn himself in.

2030
01:38:39,497 --> 01:38:43,422
'Cause then you see, then your
story assumes tragic proportions.

2031
01:38:43,501 --> 01:38:45,924
Because in the absence
of a God or something,

2032
01:38:46,003 --> 01:38:49,098
he is forced to assume
that responsibility himself.

2033
01:38:49,173 --> 01:38:51,016
Then you have...
Then you have tragedy.

2034
01:38:52,009 --> 01:38:53,852
But that's fiction, that's movies.

2035
01:38:53,928 --> 01:38:56,932
I mean... I mean,
you've seen too many movies.

2036
01:38:57,056 --> 01:38:58,979
I mean, I'm talking about reality.

2037
01:38:59,350 --> 01:39:00,943
I mean, if you want a happy ending,

2038
01:39:01,018 --> 01:39:03,521
you should go see a
Hollywood movie.

2039
01:39:05,106 --> 01:39:06,574
Come on, darling.

2040
01:39:07,316 --> 01:39:09,159
Let's think about going home, huh?

2041
01:39:09,360 --> 01:39:11,120
Nice talking to you.
Good luck to you.

2042
01:39:11,696 --> 01:39:14,620
Miriam, we're gonna make a
wedding like this for Sharon.

2043
01:39:14,699 --> 01:39:16,201
And I can't wait.

2044
01:39:16,284 --> 01:39:17,786
She'll be radiant.

2045
01:39:18,953 --> 01:39:21,047
You're looking very
handsome tonight.

2046
01:39:21,122 --> 01:39:22,920
And you look beautiful.

2047
01:39:46,898 --> 01:39:50,198
<i>We are all faced
throughout our lives</i>

2048
01:39:50,276 --> 01:39:52,745
<i>with agonizing decisions,</i>

2049
01:39:52,987 --> 01:39:54,910
<i>moral choices.</i>

2050
01:39:55,239 --> 01:39:58,334
<i>Some are on a grand scale.</i>

2051
01:39:58,409 --> 01:40:01,913
<i>Most of these choices
are on lesser points.</i>

2052
01:40:02,413 --> 01:40:05,713
<i>But we define ourselves</i>

2053
01:40:05,791 --> 01:40:08,544
<i>by the choices we have made.</i>

2054
01:40:08,711 --> 01:40:13,137
<i>We are in fact,
the sum total of our choices.</i>

2055
01:40:14,091 --> 01:40:17,686
<i>Events unfold, so unpredictably,</i>

2056
01:40:17,762 --> 01:40:19,685
<i>so unfairly,</i>

2057
01:40:20,264 --> 01:40:24,440
<i>human happiness does not
seem to have been included</i>

2058
01:40:24,644 --> 01:40:26,863
<i>in the design of creation.</i>

2059
01:40:27,396 --> 01:40:31,572
<i>It is only we,
with our capacity to love,</i>

2060
01:40:31,651 --> 01:40:35,281
<i>that give meaning
to the indifferent universe.</i>

2061
01:40:36,113 --> 01:40:39,287
<i>And yet, most human beings</i>

2062
01:40:39,450 --> 01:40:43,296
<i>seem to have the
ability to keep trying</i>

2063
01:40:43,663 --> 01:40:47,668
<i>and even to find joy
from simple things,</i>

2064
01:40:47,959 --> 01:40:50,758
<i>like their family,</i>

2065
01:40:50,920 --> 01:40:52,217
<i>their work,</i>

2066
01:40:52,838 --> 01:40:54,590
<i>and from the hope</i>

2067
01:40:54,674 --> 01:40:57,393
<i>that future generations</i>

2068
01:40:57,468 --> 01:41:00,722
<i>might understand more.</i>
