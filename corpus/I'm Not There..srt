1
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:39,630
<i>There he lies.</i>

2
00:01:39,707 --> 00:01:42,972
<i>God rest his soul,
and his rudeness.</i>

3
00:01:47,515 --> 00:01:51,975
<i>A devouring public can now share
the remains of his sickness,</i>

4
00:01:52,053 --> 00:01:54,647
<i>and his phone numbers.</i>

5
00:01:56,624 --> 00:01:58,615
<i>There he lay...</i>

6
00:01:58,693 --> 00:02:00,058
<i>poet,</i>

7
00:02:00,128 --> 00:02:01,561
<i>prophet,</i>

8
00:02:01,629 --> 00:02:03,062
<i>outlaw,</i>

9
00:02:03,131 --> 00:02:04,723
<i>fake.</i>

10
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,632
<i>Star of electricity.</i>

11
00:02:07,702 --> 00:02:10,569
<i>Nailed by a peeping Tom</i>

12
00:02:10,638 --> 00:02:12,333
<i>who would soon discover...</i>

13
00:02:12,407 --> 00:02:16,173
A poem is like a naked person.

14
00:02:16,244 --> 00:02:18,235
<i>Even the ghost...</i>

15
00:02:18,313 --> 00:02:20,247
<i>was more than one person.</i>

16
00:02:27,555 --> 00:02:30,752
But a song is something
that walks by itself.

17
00:02:37,665 --> 00:02:41,465
<i># Aw, the ragman draws circles #</i>

18
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:44,835
<i># Up and down the block #</i>

19
00:02:44,906 --> 00:02:48,342
<i># I'd ask him what the matter was #</i>

20
00:02:48,409 --> 00:02:51,469
<i># But I know that he don't talk #</i>

21
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:55,209
<i># And the ladies treat me kindly #</i>

22
00:02:55,283 --> 00:02:58,946
<i># And they furnish me with tape #</i>

23
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:02,478
<i># But deep inside my heart #</i>

24
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:06,049
<i># I know I can't escape #</i>

25
00:03:06,127 --> 00:03:09,187
<i># Oh, Mama #</i>

26
00:03:09,264 --> 00:03:12,631
<i># Can this really be the end #</i>

27
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:16,158
<i># To be stuck inside of Mobile #</i>

28
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:19,798
<i># With the Memphis blues again? #</i>

29
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:25,677
<i># Well, Shakespeare, he's in the alley #</i>

30
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:29,205
<i># With his pointed shoes and his bells #</i>

31
00:03:29,284 --> 00:03:32,720
<i># Speaking to some French girl #</i>

32
00:03:32,787 --> 00:03:36,120
<i># Who says she knows me well #</i>

33
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:39,921
<i># And I would send a message #</i>

34
00:03:39,994 --> 00:03:43,293
<i># To find out if she's talked #</i>

35
00:03:43,364 --> 00:03:47,095
<i># But the post office has been stolen #</i>

36
00:03:47,168 --> 00:03:50,660
<i># And the mailbox is locked #</i>

37
00:03:50,738 --> 00:03:54,139
<i># Oh, Mama #</i>

38
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:57,143
<i># Can this really be the end #</i>

39
00:03:57,211 --> 00:04:00,703
<i># To be stuck inside of Mobile #</i>

40
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:04,047
<i># With the Memphis blues again? #</i>

41
00:04:06,821 --> 00:04:10,484
<i># Now the rain man gave me two cures #</i>

42
00:04:10,558 --> 00:04:13,755
<i># Then he said, "Jump right in" #</i>

43
00:04:13,828 --> 00:04:17,457
<i># The one was Texas medicine #</i>

44
00:04:17,532 --> 00:04:20,831
<i># The other was just railroad gin #</i>

45
00:04:20,902 --> 00:04:24,235
<i># And like a fool I mixed them #</i>

46
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:27,741
<i># And it strangled up my mind #</i>

47
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:31,176
<i># And now people just get uglier #</i>

48
00:04:31,245 --> 00:04:34,942
<i># And I have no sense of time #</i>

49
00:04:35,016 --> 00:04:38,417
<i># Oh, Mama #</i>

50
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:41,751
<i># Can this really be the end #</i>

51
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:45,224
<i># To be stuck here inside of Mobile #</i>

52
00:04:45,293 --> 00:04:49,093
<i># With the Memphis blues again? #</i>

53
00:05:10,318 --> 00:05:13,754
Hey. How old are you, boy?

54
00:05:13,821 --> 00:05:16,551
Eleven years old.

55
00:05:16,624 --> 00:05:18,023
Oh.

56
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:20,585
What's your name, son?

57
00:05:20,662 --> 00:05:22,892
Woody.

58
00:05:22,964 --> 00:05:24,192
Woody Guthrie.

59
00:05:24,265 --> 00:05:26,733
Just like the singer.

60
00:05:27,902 --> 00:05:28,994
Way I see it,

61
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:32,335
singin's kept me right in this world
more than any Bible's ever done.

62
00:05:34,142 --> 00:05:36,133
And somethin' else I learned?

63
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:39,304
Takes just about a fountain pen
to get yourself robbed.

64
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:43,479
Hey, Joe. What do you
make about that?

65
00:05:45,653 --> 00:05:47,587
Uh, son...

66
00:05:47,655 --> 00:05:51,523
you wouldn't be stashin' no weapons
in that case of yours?

67
00:05:51,592 --> 00:05:54,584
No, sir. Not in any literalized way.

68
00:05:56,197 --> 00:05:59,098
What'd you say his name was?

69
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:01,294
<i>A- R-T-H.</i>

70
00:06:01,369 --> 00:06:03,394
Please sit down.

71
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:12,476
"A-R-T-H-U-R...

72
00:06:12,547 --> 00:06:16,108
R-I-M-B-A-U-D."

73
00:06:17,351 --> 00:06:19,444
Born October 20th.

74
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,751
That makes you 19,
nearly 20.

75
00:06:22,824 --> 00:06:24,121
Is that correct?

76
00:06:24,192 --> 00:06:25,682
That's correct.

77
00:06:27,862 --> 00:06:29,352
So what's all this about?

78
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,625
Well, Missouri, originally.

79
00:06:31,699 --> 00:06:33,564
A little town called Riddle.

80
00:06:33,634 --> 00:06:36,626
But all over, really.

81
00:06:36,704 --> 00:06:39,639
Been to Gallup, Phillipsburg,
Sioux Falls...

82
00:06:39,707 --> 00:06:42,005
I got me a cousin in Sioux Falls.

83
00:06:42,076 --> 00:06:44,874
Yeah! That's right.

84
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:47,676
Uh, is there really
a town called Riddle?

85
00:06:47,749 --> 00:06:51,515
Tell you the flat truth,
that's sort of a... a whatchamacallit.

86
00:06:51,586 --> 00:06:52,746
A, uh...

87
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,310
A composite.

88
00:06:54,388 --> 00:06:57,186
A compost heap is more like it.

89
00:07:00,995 --> 00:07:04,260
Truth is, my mind
got mixed with ramblin'

90
00:07:04,332 --> 00:07:05,663
when I was, oh, so young.

91
00:07:05,733 --> 00:07:08,531
I reckon it was Arvella Gray,

92
00:07:08,603 --> 00:07:11,401
the blind protest singer from Chicago.

93
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:13,906
She first taught me the blues

94
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:15,135
four...

95
00:07:15,209 --> 00:07:17,234
about five years back.

96
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:20,280
That's also when I first started
writin' songs on my own.

97
00:07:20,348 --> 00:07:21,815
I've written some hillbilly songs.

98
00:07:21,883 --> 00:07:23,646
You know Carl Perkins,
from Nashville?

99
00:07:23,718 --> 00:07:24,650
Yeah, yeah.

100
00:07:24,719 --> 00:07:27,085
He sings some of my songs.

101
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:29,350
Yep. Talkin' blues kind
of stuff, you know?

102
00:07:29,423 --> 00:07:31,482
Union songs.

103
00:07:31,559 --> 00:07:34,722
I also played piano with Bobby Vee.

104
00:07:34,796 --> 00:07:38,197
I would've been a millionaire
if I stayed with him.

105
00:07:40,067 --> 00:07:43,434
Well, what brings you
around these parts?

106
00:07:47,141 --> 00:07:49,006
Carelessness.

107
00:07:54,482 --> 00:07:56,916
<i>I lost my one true love.</i>

108
00:07:56,984 --> 00:07:59,418
<i>And I started drinking.</i>

109
00:08:03,157 --> 00:08:06,058
<i>Next thing I know, I'm in a crap game.</i>

110
00:08:06,127 --> 00:08:07,822
<i>I wake up in a pool hall.</i>

111
00:08:07,895 --> 00:08:09,920
<i>One night, I meet up with a Chinaman</i>

112
00:08:09,997 --> 00:08:13,956
<i>working at a dime store
who says he loves my sound.</i>

113
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:15,866
<i>And next thing I know,</i>

114
00:08:15,937 --> 00:08:19,031
<i>I'm all booked up
at his boss's establishment.</i>

115
00:08:19,106 --> 00:08:21,131
The Tiny Troubadour!

116
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:26,112
<i># I've been a... #</i>

117
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:29,047
<i># Moonshiner #</i>

118
00:08:32,019 --> 00:08:37,924
<i># For 17 long years #</i>

119
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:43,223
There you go, boy.

120
00:08:46,434 --> 00:08:47,628
<i>Of course, success ain't all</i>

121
00:08:47,702 --> 00:08:50,000
<i>it's cracked up to be, now.</i>

122
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:52,539
There's something
sort of freakish, I suppose,

123
00:08:52,607 --> 00:08:56,270
setting someone up on stage
apart from all the rest,

124
00:08:56,344 --> 00:09:00,906
when down in every boxcar
there's men of all ranges bouncing together.

125
00:09:00,982 --> 00:09:03,780
You got hobos, nobos,
gentlemen loafers.

126
00:09:03,851 --> 00:09:06,979
One or all-time losers.

127
00:09:07,054 --> 00:09:10,023
Call us what you will.

128
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:12,218
Deep down, we're all getting ready

129
00:09:12,293 --> 00:09:15,660
to tuck our heads
under our wings for sleep.

130
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:18,164
We of the Pullman side-car
and the sunburned thumb.

131
00:09:18,232 --> 00:09:21,929
We ain't kidding ourselves.

132
00:09:22,003 --> 00:09:23,800
It's lonesome roads we shall walk.

133
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:29,709
Till I joined the Union cause!

134
00:09:32,413 --> 00:09:35,382
Don't he know it's 1959?

135
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:38,418
We done unionized 20 years ago.

136
00:09:38,486 --> 00:09:42,547
Records indicate that you've been away,

137
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:44,488
that you've stopped writing.

138
00:09:44,558 --> 00:09:45,786
I've been on too many streets

139
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:47,828
to be doing the same thing
over and over.

140
00:09:47,895 --> 00:09:49,419
Can I smoke in here?

141
00:09:49,497 --> 00:09:50,794
You sound,

142
00:09:50,865 --> 00:09:52,594
for someone so widely known,

143
00:09:52,667 --> 00:09:53,599
a bit fatalistic.

144
00:09:53,668 --> 00:09:56,694
I'm not fatalistic.

145
00:09:56,771 --> 00:09:58,295
Bank tellers are fatalistic.

146
00:09:58,372 --> 00:09:59,566
Clerks are fatalistic.

147
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,665
I'm a farmer.

148
00:10:01,742 --> 00:10:04,768
Who ever heard
of a fatalistic farmer?

149
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:12,116
# The sweet, pretty things
are in bed now, of course #

150
00:10:12,186 --> 00:10:15,952
# The city fathers,
they're trying to endorse #

151
00:10:16,023 --> 00:10:19,720
# The reincarnation
of Paul Revere's horse #

152
00:10:19,794 --> 00:10:23,662
# But the town has no need
to be nervous #

153
00:10:23,731 --> 00:10:27,861
# The hysterical bride
in the penny arcade #

154
00:10:27,935 --> 00:10:31,564
# Screaming, she moans,
"I've just been made" #

155
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:35,166
# Then sends out for the doctor
who pulls down the shade #

156
00:10:35,242 --> 00:10:39,076
# Says, "My advice
is to not let the boys in" #

157
00:10:39,146 --> 00:10:43,583
# Where Ma Raney and Beethoven
once unwrapped their bed roll #

158
00:10:43,651 --> 00:10:47,280
# Tuba players now rehearse
around the flagpole #

159
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:49,220
# And the national bank for a profit #

160
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:51,224
# Sells road maps for the soul #

161
00:10:51,292 --> 00:10:55,695
# To the old folks home
and the college #

162
00:10:55,763 --> 00:10:57,060
# Mama's in the factory #

163
00:10:57,131 --> 00:10:59,395
# She ain't got no shoes #

164
00:10:59,467 --> 00:11:01,196
# Daddy's in the alley #

165
00:11:01,268 --> 00:11:03,361
# He's lookin' for food #

166
00:11:03,437 --> 00:11:05,029
# I'm in the kitchen #

167
00:11:05,106 --> 00:11:08,769
# With the tombstone blues #

168
00:11:08,843 --> 00:11:11,971
# Hey, hey, yeah #

169
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:13,172
Whoo!

170
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:16,577
Oh!

171
00:11:18,953 --> 00:11:22,354
Boy, look like you found...
you found your freedom

172
00:11:22,423 --> 00:11:24,084
before you found your technique.

173
00:11:24,158 --> 00:11:26,888
Now, real American music
come from the bottom up.

174
00:11:26,961 --> 00:11:28,952
You take Blind Willie McTell.

175
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:31,294
He's the best blues singer
east of Cannery Row.

176
00:11:31,365 --> 00:11:33,629
He say, "Son, if you can
sing these songs

177
00:11:33,701 --> 00:11:37,865
and understand them,
ain't no place you can't go.

178
00:11:37,938 --> 00:11:39,530
Ah, thank you very much, ma'am.

179
00:11:39,607 --> 00:11:40,631
You're welcome.

180
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:42,073
I reckon I come out the womb

181
00:11:42,143 --> 00:11:44,236
singing and picking
and playing and all that mess.

182
00:11:44,311 --> 00:11:45,471
So where your people at?

183
00:11:45,546 --> 00:11:47,411
Your kinfolk?

184
00:11:47,481 --> 00:11:48,778
Oh, they back in Stockton, ma'am.

185
00:11:48,849 --> 00:11:50,874
California.
That's where I was raised.

186
00:11:50,951 --> 00:11:53,920
I figured they got plenty
of mouths to feed as it is.

187
00:11:53,988 --> 00:11:56,422
Not that I care a fig about material things,

188
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:59,550
you know, except for
maybe a decent car.

189
00:11:59,627 --> 00:12:01,492
See, us thumb-slummers
and box-jumpers,

190
00:12:01,562 --> 00:12:03,757
we get a little peckish
when it comes to cars, you know?

191
00:12:03,831 --> 00:12:06,231
That boy sound just like Doughboy Hawkins,

192
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,892
a fella I met in the Dust Bowl.

193
00:12:07,968 --> 00:12:10,129
Tell you what I think.
I think it's 1959,

194
00:12:10,204 --> 00:12:12,069
and this boy's singing
songs about the boxcar?

195
00:12:12,139 --> 00:12:14,664
Hmm. What a boxcar
gonna mean to him?

196
00:12:14,742 --> 00:12:18,576
Right here, we got race riots,
folks with no food.

197
00:12:18,646 --> 00:12:20,170
Why ain't he out there
singing about that?

198
00:12:20,247 --> 00:12:21,612
The boy a guest in our house.

199
00:12:21,682 --> 00:12:24,116
I know he's a guest.
I'm just trying to speak what's in my mind.

200
00:12:24,185 --> 00:12:25,413
No!

201
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:29,786
Say it.

202
00:12:35,596 --> 00:12:39,430
Live your own time, child.

203
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,468
Sing about your own time.

204
00:12:50,711 --> 00:12:52,110
<i>Greenwich Village,</i>

205
00:12:52,179 --> 00:12:54,841
<i>once the in spot
for beatnik jazz and bebop,</i>

206
00:12:54,915 --> 00:12:58,043
<i>is today home
to the popular folk music fad,</i>

207
00:12:58,119 --> 00:12:59,848
<i>a do-it-yourself musical expression</i>

208
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,117
<i>that's attracted youngsters
from all across the nation.</i>

209
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:06,159
<i>For them,
these homespun songs of the working man</i>

210
00:13:06,227 --> 00:13:07,717
<i>express a truth and candor</i>

211
00:13:07,795 --> 00:13:11,697
<i>sorely lacking in today's
growing consumer society.</i>

212
00:13:11,765 --> 00:13:14,962
Why do you prefer folk music
to other types of music?

213
00:13:15,035 --> 00:13:17,560
Because it's honest.

214
00:13:17,638 --> 00:13:20,471
Commercial songs,
pop music can't be honest.

215
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:23,772
It's controlled and censored
by the people who run society

216
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:25,175
and make the rules.

217
00:13:25,246 --> 00:13:26,645
<i>Yet, among the many new</i>

218
00:13:26,714 --> 00:13:28,477
<i>and talented artists to emerge,</i>

219
00:13:28,549 --> 00:13:31,074
<i>one name stands alone
as the heart and soul</i>

220
00:13:31,152 --> 00:13:33,347
<i>of this growing musical trend.</i>

221
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:36,412
<i>A young individual
who both writes and performs</i>

222
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:38,685
<i>some of his era's finest tunes,</i>

223
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:40,449
<i>and hailed by the New York Times</i>

224
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:43,759
<i>as folk music's
Troubadour of Conscience.</i>

225
00:13:43,831 --> 00:13:47,699
<i>His name is Jack Rollins.</i>

226
00:13:47,768 --> 00:13:49,633
<i>Jack Rollins,</i>

227
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:52,035
<i>folk sensation of the early '60s,</i>

228
00:13:52,106 --> 00:13:54,540
<i>was the promise of a new generation.</i>

229
00:13:54,608 --> 00:13:56,599
<i>So what was it that made him run</i>

230
00:13:56,677 --> 00:13:59,271
<i>at the height of his career
and throw it all away,</i>

231
00:13:59,346 --> 00:14:03,339
<i>trading in the limelight
for a different kind of light altogether?</i>

232
00:14:03,417 --> 00:14:06,215
He saw what was going on
in the world,

233
00:14:06,287 --> 00:14:10,053
and he had the ability
to distill it into a song.

234
00:14:10,124 --> 00:14:12,149
He could do a funny thing.

235
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:14,694
He could do a pathos thing.
He was sensational.

236
00:14:14,762 --> 00:14:18,789
# For the times, they are a-changin' #

237
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:25,296
<i>Now, this young man has
taken to the hearts of young people</i>

238
00:14:25,372 --> 00:14:30,332
who seem to somehow identify with, uh...

239
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:33,175
Jack, why do you think that is?

240
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:35,147
Well, I don't know.

241
00:14:35,216 --> 00:14:38,014
I... I guess...

242
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:41,350
I got a lot of thoughts inside of me,

243
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:44,220
and most people, they...

244
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:47,727
they... keep them all inside.

245
00:14:47,795 --> 00:14:51,253
And I guess it's for them
that I do what I do.

246
00:14:51,332 --> 00:14:53,266
<i>Today, the name Jack Rollins</i>

247
00:14:53,334 --> 00:14:55,495
<i>might best be remembered
as the tortured singer</i>

248
00:14:55,569 --> 00:14:58,800
<i>battling his conscience
in the 1965 drama,</i>

249
00:14:58,872 --> 00:15:00,203
Grain of Sand.

250
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:01,969
<i>The role, of course,
that launched the career</i>

251
00:15:02,042 --> 00:15:04,067
<i>of Hollywood rebel Robbie Clark.</i>

252
00:15:04,144 --> 00:15:05,543
Hell, I don't pick what I sing.

253
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:07,638
<i>It picks me.</i>

254
00:15:07,715 --> 00:15:09,012
Some of it ain't pretty.

255
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:10,573
I mean, how you ever
gonna change anything

256
00:15:10,651 --> 00:15:12,448
if you only wanna show what's pretty?

257
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:15,420
<i>In his first exclusive interview in 20 years...</i>

258
00:15:15,556 --> 00:15:21,188
Tonight, we bring you face-to-face
with the real Jack Rollins.

259
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:29,701
# William Zanzinger
killed poor Hattie Carroll #

260
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:32,034
# With a cane that he twirled #

261
00:15:32,106 --> 00:15:34,370
# 'Round his diamond ring finger #

262
00:15:34,441 --> 00:15:37,035
<i>He saw what was going on
in the world,</i>

263
00:15:37,111 --> 00:15:40,774
and he had the ability
to distill it into a song.

264
00:15:40,848 --> 00:15:42,645
And this elevated the discussion.

265
00:15:42,716 --> 00:15:44,684
I mean, certainly
within the folk world,

266
00:15:44,752 --> 00:15:48,552
but all through popular music,
the bar had risen.

267
00:15:48,622 --> 00:15:49,953
<i>Alice Fabian</i>

268
00:15:50,024 --> 00:15:52,959
<i>was herself a leading figure
in the folk revival,</i>

269
00:15:53,027 --> 00:15:54,995
<i>achieving international success</i>

270
00:15:55,062 --> 00:15:58,395
<i>a few years before
their first meeting in 1962.</i>

271
00:15:58,465 --> 00:16:01,923
Hey, you're in my chair.

272
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:05,099
I was at a party in the Village,

273
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:08,039
and this twerpy little kid
who'd been hanging around,

274
00:16:08,108 --> 00:16:10,668
kind of flirting with my baby sister
and kissing up to me,

275
00:16:10,744 --> 00:16:13,042
starts playing these songs
that he'd written on guitar.

276
00:16:13,113 --> 00:16:16,514
Now, this was '61, '62,

277
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:19,074
and all anybody sang were traditionals,

278
00:16:19,153 --> 00:16:23,954
and here's this kid, applying traditional form
to contemporary concerns,

279
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:26,015
but with such insight, you know?

280
00:16:26,093 --> 00:16:27,526
<i>It was devastating.</i>

281
00:16:27,594 --> 00:16:30,654
<i>You couldn't believe
this was coming out of this little toad.</i>

282
00:16:30,731 --> 00:16:34,667
<i>Nobody was writing songs like that.</i>

283
00:16:34,735 --> 00:16:36,498
It was as if he was giving voice to ideas

284
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:40,006
that I wanted to express
but didn't know how.

285
00:16:40,074 --> 00:16:42,668
Um, his finger-pointing songs,
he called 'em.

286
00:16:42,743 --> 00:16:46,702
He was churning them out
like ticker tape.

287
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:50,181
Well, folk music has always
been a political music,

288
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:53,651
but he was really expressing
it as an art form

289
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:57,589
in a way that was multileveled and very deep.

290
00:16:57,658 --> 00:17:01,617
# Hattie Carroll
was a maid of the kitchen #

291
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:04,163
# She was 51 years old #

292
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:06,461
# And gave birth to ten children #

293
00:17:06,533 --> 00:17:11,061
# Who carried the dishes
and took out the garbage #

294
00:17:11,138 --> 00:17:15,700
# And never sat once
at the head of the table #

295
00:17:15,776 --> 00:17:19,940
# And didn't even talk
to the people at the table #

296
00:17:20,013 --> 00:17:24,677
# She just cleaned up
all the food from the table #

297
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:29,246
# And emptied the ashtrays
on a whole other level #

298
00:17:29,323 --> 00:17:34,386
# Got killed by a blow,
lay slain by a cane #

299
00:17:34,461 --> 00:17:35,450
<i>Every night,</i>

300
00:17:35,529 --> 00:17:37,827
<i>I would call this ragamuffin on stage</i>

301
00:17:37,898 --> 00:17:42,028
<i>and introduce America
to Jack Rollins.</i>

302
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:44,366
<i>I'd say, you know,
that he has something to say,</i>

303
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:48,238
<i>you know, and that he is...
he is speaking for me</i>

304
00:17:48,308 --> 00:17:50,799
<i>and everybody who wants
a better world.</i>

305
00:17:50,878 --> 00:17:56,145
# Oh, but you who
philosophize disgrace #

306
00:17:56,216 --> 00:18:00,516
# And criticize all fears #

307
00:18:00,587 --> 00:18:05,752
# Bury the rag deep in your face #

308
00:18:05,826 --> 00:18:09,318
# Now is the time for your tears #

309
00:18:09,396 --> 00:18:11,023
<i>He knows how to peel the surface</i>

310
00:18:11,098 --> 00:18:12,190
<i>from what he sees.</i>

311
00:18:12,266 --> 00:18:15,565
<i>His songs are like a true vision
of how things really are.</i>

312
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:18,127
<i>Well, I just find
he's the most piercing</i>

313
00:18:18,205 --> 00:18:21,766
and aware insight working today.

314
00:18:21,842 --> 00:18:22,934
You'd have thought we invented it,

315
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:25,205
we were so pleased and proud.

316
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:33,251
Sure, there was a certain tendency
in the folk movement

317
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:36,050
for nostalgia about the Depression

318
00:18:36,123 --> 00:18:39,092
and the radicalism
that came out of it.

319
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:40,649
They were coming out
of a shitty time...

320
00:18:40,727 --> 00:18:43,093
the McCarthy era, Eisenhower era.

321
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:46,929
<i>So, as long as folk remained
strictly a minority taste,</i>

322
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,128
<i>it would always be us against the big, bad
commercial tastelessness.</i>

323
00:18:50,204 --> 00:18:52,638
<i>But when the big, bad commercial
tastelessness</i>

324
00:18:52,706 --> 00:18:55,675
<i>finally caught on to Jack,</i>

325
00:18:55,742 --> 00:18:59,143
<i>then, well, all of a sudden,</i>

326
00:18:59,213 --> 00:19:01,579
the race was on.

327
00:19:01,648 --> 00:19:03,878
And this time,
somebody was going to win.

328
00:19:03,951 --> 00:19:04,918
He was a rebel.

329
00:19:04,985 --> 00:19:06,850
I wanted to record protest.

330
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,387
Of course, that's right
when we were getting

331
00:19:08,455 --> 00:19:10,446
into that whole Nam business.

332
00:19:10,624 --> 00:19:15,027
Jack really stopped protesting after 1963.

333
00:19:15,095 --> 00:19:19,361
He said that you couldn't
effect change with a song.

334
00:19:19,433 --> 00:19:22,095
You could only write
about what was inside you,

335
00:19:22,169 --> 00:19:25,400
and folk music, he said, was, um...

336
00:19:25,472 --> 00:19:27,565
was fat people.

337
00:19:27,641 --> 00:19:30,371
He said it made him feel
like the Establishment,

338
00:19:30,444 --> 00:19:33,743
you know, and he always
fought the Establishment.

339
00:19:33,814 --> 00:19:38,015
<i># You will search, babe #</i>

340
00:19:38,085 --> 00:19:42,021
<i># At any cost #</i>

341
00:19:46,093 --> 00:19:50,393
<i># Everybody will help you #</i>

342
00:19:51,999 --> 00:19:57,266
<i># Some people are very kind #</i>

343
00:19:57,337 --> 00:20:00,932

<i># Can save you any time #</i>

345
00:20:08,348 --> 00:20:12,284
<i># Come on, give it to me #</i>

346
00:20:12,352 --> 00:20:15,116
<i># I'll keep it with mine #</i>

347
00:20:15,188 --> 00:20:16,780
<i>You don't have to write anything down</i>

348
00:20:16,857 --> 00:20:18,154
<i>to be a poet.</i>

351
00:20:24,398 --> 00:20:27,765
I don't really call myself one,
'cause I don't like the word.

358
00:20:49,423 --> 00:20:51,448
Get off of there, grunt!

359
00:20:51,525 --> 00:20:53,152

360

Yes, sir.

N-No, sir.

366
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:07,167
He's lying.

367
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,571
What's that?

368
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:10,667
That your fiddle? Huh?

369
00:21:10,744 --> 00:21:11,938
Give it back. Huh?

370
00:21:12,012 --> 00:21:15,072
What's it say on that thing?

371
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:17,343

372
00:21:17,417 --> 00:21:18,577
Nothing!

373
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:19,949
Get him, boys!

374
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,783
Ahh!

375
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:27,487
Ah, you little...

376
00:21:27,561 --> 00:21:29,358
Give me...

377
00:21:39,439 --> 00:21:42,875
This here young'un,
the Tiny Troubadour,

378
00:21:42,943 --> 00:21:44,934

379
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:47,446
So what bring you around these parts?

380
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:49,482
Could've sworn he was an older man.

381
00:21:49,549 --> 00:21:51,039
Live your own time, child.

382
00:21:51,118 --> 00:21:52,050
Get him, boys!

383
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:54,144
You reckon he's
some kind of midget?

384
00:21:54,221 --> 00:21:56,746
<i>He's lying!</i>

385
00:21:58,358 --> 00:22:01,691

391

394
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:06,450

395
00:23:06,526 --> 00:23:10,292

you're going to have...

397
00:23:15,235 --> 00:23:17,931
on a boat with the water?

398
00:23:18,004 --> 00:23:20,165
Sounds pretty neat
what your daddy's planned.

399
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,401
Me, too!

400
00:23:24,144 --> 00:23:26,544
Why can't you come?

401
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:29,741
Molly, you know I can't come.

402
00:23:29,816 --> 00:23:31,374
Is that why...

403
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:34,113
you think you're feeling
nervous about the boat?

404
00:23:34,187 --> 00:23:35,347
Hmm?

405
00:23:35,422 --> 00:23:38,016
When's Daddy coming?

406
00:23:38,091 --> 00:23:40,321
Uh, Saturday, I think.

407
00:23:40,393 --> 00:23:42,588
I only spoke to Sally
because it's impossible

408
00:23:42,662 --> 00:23:43,856

409
00:23:45,665 --> 00:23:47,326

you like so much about me?

Uh, what scene?

503
00:29:30,844 --> 00:29:32,903

- Wait, wait, wait. What scene?

505
00:29:34,614 --> 00:29:36,844
- What did you see?
- The scene in the lane.

506
00:29:36,916 --> 00:29:39,043
Hmm.

507
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:43,249
I would like to know
what is at the center of your world.

508
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:44,551
The center of my world?

509
00:29:44,624 --> 00:29:48,082
Uh...

510
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:49,628

Why?

512
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:53,492
It's very simple, this question.

513
00:29:53,566 --> 00:29:57,002
Um... hmm.

514
00:29:57,070 --> 00:30:00,198
Well, I'm 22.
I guess I would say me.

515
00:30:03,743 --> 00:30:05,438
I suppose you're honest.

516
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:07,173
Well, don't you think
that you're the center

517
00:30:07,247 --> 00:30:09,579
or that you should be the center,

518
00:30:09,649 --> 00:30:12,777
thinking with your own head,
talking with your own mouth?

519
00:30:12,852 --> 00:30:13,910
Yeah.

520
00:30:13,987 --> 00:30:17,047
But there are things in the world, too,
that are important.

521
00:30:17,123 --> 00:30:18,681
I'm not denying that.

522
00:30:18,758 --> 00:30:20,521

# Before the hurricane begins #

627
00:36:06,472 --> 00:36:10,374
# The hour that

Remarkable.

637
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:43,474

638
00:36:43,543 --> 00:36:45,272

- Fantastic!

641
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:58,049
That was a fine job.

642
00:36:58,124 --> 00:36:59,785
- Thank you, thank you.
- That's just wonderful.

643
00:36:59,859 --> 00:37:01,656
How about another helping?

644
00:37:01,727 --> 00:37:03,752
- Woody?
- Yes, ma'am.

645
00:37:03,829 --> 00:37:05,023
More wine, Woody?

646
00:37:05,097 --> 00:37:06,325
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

647
00:37:06,399 --> 00:37:08,230
Do you know
what your plans are from here?

648
00:37:08,301 --> 00:37:11,065
My only real plan
is to become a singer,

649
00:37:11,137 --> 00:37:13,002
a real singer on television,

650
00:37:13,072 --> 00:37:15,506
either that or a kind of voice
of the people, you know?

651
00:37:15,575 --> 00:37:16,701
Interesting.

652
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:18,937
Because I've been
writing me some songs,

653
00:37:19,011 --> 00:37:22,003
songs about what's going on.

654
00:37:22,081 --> 00:37:23,309
And I'm going
to take these songs,

655
00:37:23,382 --> 00:37:25,942
and I'm going to head
straight to Hollywood.

656
00:37:26,018 --> 00:37:28,612
Going to make it big just like Elvis Presley.

657
00:37:28,688 --> 00:37:30,588
Well, Woody, I wouldn't be surprised

658
00:37:30,656 --> 00:37:31,782
if you did just that.

659
00:37:31,857 --> 00:37:33,552
- There you are, Woody.
- Thank you.

660
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:38,120
And don't you go rushing off anyplace
until you feel 1000/0, you hear?

661
00:37:38,197 --> 00:37:39,289
Yes, ma'am.

662
00:37:39,365 --> 00:37:42,198
Have to mother you while you still have
a roof over your head.

663
00:37:44,103 --> 00:37:45,866
Who on earth?

664
00:37:45,938 --> 00:37:48,168
- Are you expecting a call?
- No.

665
00:37:50,042 --> 00:37:50,974
So, Hollywood?

666
00:37:51,043 --> 00:37:53,238
- Hello?
- Not Tin Pan Alley?

667
00:37:53,312 --> 00:37:56,543
Yes, it is. Who's calling?

668
00:37:56,616 --> 00:37:58,311
Minnesota?

669
00:37:58,384 --> 00:38:01,080
Well, how could...

670
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:03,280
Dr. Field, yes.

671
00:38:03,356 --> 00:38:06,154
Would you hold on
just a moment, please?

672
00:38:06,225 --> 00:38:07,317
Esther?

673
00:38:07,393 --> 00:38:10,294
It's a juvenile center in Minnesota.

674
00:38:10,363 --> 00:38:11,295
A what?

675
00:38:11,364 --> 00:38:13,730
Something... Corrections.

676
00:38:13,799 --> 00:38:16,290
You talk to 'em, Jack.

677
00:38:16,369 --> 00:38:18,462
They think it's Woody.

678
00:38:18,537 --> 00:38:20,471
What do they know about Woody?

679
00:38:20,539 --> 00:38:22,803
They said they're looking for some...

680
00:38:22,875 --> 00:38:24,638
a juvenile, but...

681
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:30,080
some state, you know, fugitive.

682
00:38:30,149 --> 00:38:32,743
Certainly not Woody.

Sighting it, hearing it,

689

seeing and feeling

690
00:39:09,588 --> 00:39:11,852
Sucking down on it.

<i>Kennedy's funeral was on TV,
and we were sitting outside.</i>

714
00:41:38,771 --> 00:41:40,033
You could hear it.

715
00:41:40,105 --> 00:41:42,972
I was pulling up
chunks of grass with my fist

716
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:45,738
and feeling like we were splitting apart.

717
00:41:45,811 --> 00:41:48,371
And... And, yeah, I asked him

718
00:41:48,447 --> 00:41:50,506
what did he think
made us so different?

719
00:41:50,583 --> 00:41:53,518
And he said it was simple.

720
00:41:53,586 --> 00:41:56,111
You know, I thought
that I could change things,

721
00:41:56,188 --> 00:41:57,780
and he knew that no one could.

722
00:41:57,857 --> 00:42:00,257
You know, look at Kennedy.

723
00:42:02,828 --> 00:42:06,821
<i>Then there was the fiasco

724
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:08,924
<i>where Jack received
the Civil Rights Award</i>

725
00:42:09,001 --> 00:42:12,528
<i>and drank three vats of wine

726
00:42:12,605 --> 00:42:13,867
Thank you.

727
00:42:13,939 --> 00:42:15,907
I wanna accept this
on behalf of, uh,

728
00:42:15,975 --> 00:42:18,637
everybody that
went down to Cuba.

729
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:23,113
First of all,
because you're all young, you know?

730
00:42:23,182 --> 00:42:24,945
And it's took me
a long time to get young,

731
00:42:25,017 --> 00:42:28,009
and now I consider myself young.

732
00:42:28,087 --> 00:42:31,147
And I'm proud of it.

733
00:42:31,223 --> 00:42:33,748
It ain't old people's world out there.

734
00:42:33,826 --> 00:42:37,887
I mean, you all
shouldn't even be here.

735
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:44,096
I mean... it's not like before.

736
00:42:44,169 --> 00:42:45,796
There's no black or white,

737
00:42:45,871 --> 00:42:48,305
no more left wing,
right wing, you know?

738
00:42:48,374 --> 00:42:51,309
There's up wing
and there's down wing,

739
00:42:51,377 --> 00:42:52,776
which is why I think that, you know,

740
00:42:52,845 --> 00:42:57,179
this man who shot President Kennedy,

741
00:42:57,249 --> 00:43:00,309
this Lee Oswald,

742
00:43:00,386 --> 00:43:06,325
I think I saw something
that... that he felt... in me.

743
00:43:09,762 --> 00:43:12,492
Hey, but I'm just saying...

744
00:43:12,564 --> 00:43:15,829
You can boo, but booing's
got nothing to do with it!

745
00:43:15,901 --> 00:43:17,493
<i>They didn't understand me,
you know,</i>

746
00:43:17,569 --> 00:43:19,093
because they got mind blinders on.

747
00:43:19,171 --> 00:43:20,195
All they see is the cause

748
00:43:20,272 --> 00:43:21,739
and how they use people
for their cause.

749
00:43:21,807 --> 00:43:23,399
And now they're trying
to use me for something.

750
00:43:23,475 --> 00:43:25,466
The want me to... want me
to carry a picket sign

751
00:43:25,544 --> 00:43:28,980
and have my picture taken,

752
00:43:29,048 --> 00:43:30,777
be a good little nigger, you know,

753
00:43:30,849 --> 00:43:32,840
and not mess up their little game.

754
00:43:32,918 --> 00:43:36,854
All they want from me
is finger-pointing songs.

755
00:43:36,922 --> 00:43:39,322
I only got ten fingers.

756
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:41,188
<i>Anybody who lent that kid a dime</i>

757
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:43,854
<i>was sitting in that room that night.</i>

758
00:43:43,929 --> 00:43:46,989
<i>A week later, he issued
a formal apology.</i>

759
00:43:47,066 --> 00:43:49,000
<i>It's a fierce, heavy feeling,</i>

760
00:43:49,068 --> 00:43:51,093
<i>thinking that something's expected of you,</i>

761
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:55,402
<i>but you don't know exactly what it is.</i>

762
00:43:55,474 --> 00:43:58,966
<i>Brings forth a weird kind of guilt.</i>

763
00:44:14,426 --> 00:44:17,862
<i>Woody Guthrie was dead.</i>

764
00:44:17,930 --> 00:44:20,490
<i>Little Richard
was becoming a preacher.</i>

765
00:44:20,566 --> 00:44:24,525
<i>So, whether you were
a folk singer or a Christian,</i>

766
00:44:24,603 --> 00:44:26,764
<i>rock and roll was the devil.</i>

767
00:44:30,242 --> 00:44:32,403
<i>Me, I was in a ditch, up a cliff,</i>

768
00:44:32,478 --> 00:44:34,673
<i>out of step, ready to quit.</i>

769
00:44:36,815 --> 00:44:39,477
I wrote the kind of stuff
you write when you have no place to live

770
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:41,416
and you're wrapped up
in the fire pump.

771
00:44:45,090 --> 00:44:48,753
<i>I nearly killed myself
with pity and despair.</i>

772
00:44:51,296 --> 00:44:52,923
<i>And then I wrote it.</i>

773
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:57,863
<i>It was like swimming in lava.</i>

774
00:44:57,936 --> 00:45:01,133
<i>Skipping, kicking,</i>

775
00:45:01,206 --> 00:45:05,040
<i>catching a nail with your foot,</i>

776
00:45:05,110 --> 00:45:08,307
<i>seeing your victim
hanging from a tree.</i>

777
00:45:15,754 --> 00:45:18,882
The person who's coming out now

778
00:45:18,957 --> 00:45:22,256
is a person who has, in a sense,

779
00:45:22,327 --> 00:45:25,660
changed the face
of American folk music...

780
00:45:32,304 --> 00:45:34,101
Ladies and gentlemen,

781
00:45:34,173 --> 00:45:35,538
the person
who's coming out now...

782
00:45:37,609 --> 00:45:40,043
...is a legend in his time.

783
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:43,138
And his name is Jude Quinn!

784
00:45:52,858 --> 00:45:57,727
# Well, I try my best
to be just like I am #

785
00:45:57,796 --> 00:46:01,425
# But everybody wants you
to be just like them #

786
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:05,459
# They say sing while you slave
but I just get bored #

787
00:46:05,537 --> 00:46:10,099
# Well, I ain't gonna work
on Maggie's farm no more #

788
00:46:17,149 --> 00:46:18,776
I want that volume down now!

789
00:46:18,851 --> 00:46:20,079
I can't turn the volume down!

790
00:46:20,152 --> 00:46:21,619
- I can't even hear the words!
- Hey, man...

791
00:46:21,687 --> 00:46:23,177
Hey what's wrong?

792
00:46:23,255 --> 00:46:24,517
Man, what are you going to do?

793
00:46:24,590 --> 00:46:25,818
What are you going to do up there?

794
00:46:25,891 --> 00:46:28,655
I'm going to cut
the goddamn... lead!

795
00:47:02,628 --> 00:47:04,391
Sorry for everything I've done,

796
00:47:04,463 --> 00:47:07,489
and, uh, I hope
to remedy it soon.

797
00:47:07,566 --> 00:47:08,692
- Shit!
- Crap!

798
00:47:08,767 --> 00:47:10,234
<i>Garbage! J'accuse!</i>

799
00:47:10,302 --> 00:47:12,862
Ah, it's just like
he's trying to conform

800
00:47:12,938 --> 00:47:15,566
to some sort of popular taste

801
00:47:15,641 --> 00:47:18,508
with this incredibly
corny group behind him,

802
00:47:18,577 --> 00:47:22,536
but he's just... he's just prostituting himself.

803
00:47:22,614 --> 00:47:25,674
He's... He's just
changed completely.

804
00:47:25,751 --> 00:47:28,413
He's changed from what he was.

805
00:47:28,487 --> 00:47:31,115
He's not the same
as he was at first.

806
00:47:31,190 --> 00:47:33,351
Nothing but a fake neurotic

807
00:47:33,425 --> 00:47:34,653
crawling through the gutter.

808
00:47:34,726 --> 00:47:36,523
If that is the way
he walks through a gutter,

809
00:47:36,595 --> 00:47:39,530
I would rather walk with my head up
through a gutter than like him,

810
00:47:39,598 --> 00:47:41,065
crawling through the bloody gutter,

811
00:47:41,133 --> 00:47:42,430
just making a pile out of it!

812
00:47:42,501 --> 00:47:43,900
That's what he is doing!

813
00:47:43,969 --> 00:47:46,802
He is just making a pile out of it!

814
00:47:46,872 --> 00:47:50,638
I kinda liked getting
blasted out of my skin.

815
00:47:51,777 --> 00:47:54,439
I think he's evil.

816
00:47:54,513 --> 00:47:57,038
And we were his biggest fans.

817
00:48:06,959 --> 00:48:10,520
<i># You've got a lot of nerve #</i>

818
00:48:10,596 --> 00:48:15,295

00:48:15,367 --> 00:48:17,392

00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:39,589
<i># On the side that's winning #</i>

825
00:48:39,658 --> 00:48:41,353
It's not folk, it's not rock,

826
00:48:41,426 --> 00:48:43,189
but a brand-new way
of telling it like it is.

827
00:48:43,262 --> 00:48:45,355
And Jude Quinn is definitely what's happening.

828
00:48:45,430 --> 00:48:46,624
Here he comes now.

829
00:48:46,698 --> 00:48:47,960
Mr. Quinn! Mr. Quinn!

830
00:48:48,033 --> 00:48:49,830
Have you got a word
for your fans?

831
00:48:49,901 --> 00:48:51,493
Uh, astronaut.

- Over here!

836
00:49:11,456 --> 00:49:12,548
- Yes?
- Look over here, Jude!

837
00:49:12,624 --> 00:49:13,556
Thank you.

838
00:49:13,625 --> 00:49:14,887
Why do you think you were booed

839
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:17,394
at your recent appearance
in New England?

840
00:49:17,462 --> 00:49:21,193
Well, um, I f...

841
00:49:21,266 --> 00:49:23,962
I figure there's
a little boo in all of us.

842
00:49:24,036 --> 00:49:25,128
- Jude!
- Mr. Quinn, Mr. Quinn!

843
00:49:25,203 --> 00:49:27,000
Is it true you no longer
sing protest songs?

844
00:49:27,072 --> 00:49:28,334
Who said that?

845
00:49:28,407 --> 00:49:29,339
I didn't say that.

846
00:49:29,408 --> 00:49:33,276
I was just, uh... I read somewhere
that you no longer do the protesting.

847
00:49:34,713 --> 00:49:39,673
Well, that's all I ever do is protest.

848
00:49:39,751 --> 00:49:41,514
Do you have a message?

849
00:49:42,688 --> 00:49:44,019
Do you?

850
00:49:44,089 --> 00:49:46,057
I mean, are you trying
to accomplish anything?

851
00:49:46,124 --> 00:49:48,149
Am I trying to accomplish anything?

852
00:49:48,226 --> 00:49:50,387
Are you trying to change
the world or anything?

853
00:49:50,462 --> 00:49:52,760
What am I trying to change
the word, did you say? Is...

854
00:49:52,831 --> 00:49:56,289
You know, are you trying
to push your idealism to the people?

855
00:49:56,368 --> 00:49:58,700
- No.
- Excuse me, Mr. Quinn.

856
00:49:58,770 --> 00:50:00,465
Perhaps you could tell us...

857
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:02,029
Do you have a match?

858
00:50:02,107 --> 00:50:05,076
...how many people who labor
in the same musical vineyards

859
00:50:05,143 --> 00:50:06,075
in which you toil...

860
00:50:06,144 --> 00:50:07,805
That's very pretty.

861
00:50:07,879 --> 00:50:10,245
How many would you say
are protest singers today?

862
00:50:10,315 --> 00:50:15,947
That is, people who protest
against the social state we live in?

863
00:50:16,021 --> 00:50:17,579
Uh, how many?

864
00:50:17,656 --> 00:50:20,056
Yes. Are there many?

865
00:50:20,125 --> 00:50:23,686
Yeah, um...

866
00:50:23,762 --> 00:50:27,095
I-I think there's about 136.

867

<i>Mr. Quinn, Keenan Jones
from Culture Beat.</i>

868
00:50:30,235 --> 00:50:35,036
As someone symbolic of the protest
movement among young people,

869
00:50:35,107 --> 00:50:37,337
some have questioned,
given your latest recordings,

870
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:40,435
whether or not you still care
about people as you once did.

871
00:50:41,546 --> 00:50:44,674
Yeah, but, you know,

872
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:47,776
we all have our own definitions
of all those words.

873
00:50:47,853 --> 00:50:52,153
"Care" and "people..."

874
00:50:52,224 --> 00:50:54,784
Well, I think we all know
the definition of people.

875
00:50:54,860 --> 00:50:57,260
Yeah.

876
00:50:57,329 --> 00:50:59,126
Do we?

877
00:50:59,197 --> 00:51:00,789
Well, is it your belief,
then, that folk music

878
00:51:00,866 --> 00:51:03,926
has, perchance, failed to achieve
its goals with the Negro cause

879
00:51:04,002 --> 00:51:05,594
or the cause of peace?

880
00:51:05,670 --> 00:51:09,071
You know, saying "cause of peace"

881
00:51:09,141 --> 00:51:13,077
is just like saying...
like a hunk of butter.

882
00:51:13,145 --> 00:51:15,545
You know, I don't know
how you can listen to anybody

883
00:51:15,614 --> 00:51:17,844
who wants you to believe
is dedicated to the hunk

884
00:51:17,916 --> 00:51:19,110
and not the butter.

885
00:51:19,184 --> 00:51:20,913
I'm not sure I follow.

886
00:51:20,986 --> 00:51:26,014
You know, I didn't come
out of some cereal box.

887
00:51:26,091 --> 00:51:27,752
There's... There's no one out there

888
00:51:27,826 --> 00:51:29,487
who's ever going to be
converted by a song.

889
00:51:29,561 --> 00:51:33,895
There's no Phil Ochs song
that's going to keep

890
00:51:33,965 --> 00:51:37,423
a movement moving
nor the picket line picketing.

891
00:51:37,502 --> 00:51:40,471
His songs are acts
of personal conscience,

892
00:51:40,539 --> 00:51:44,441
like burning a draft card
or burning yourself.

893
00:51:44,509 --> 00:51:48,309
Doesn't do a damn thing
except disassociate you

894
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:51,076
and your audience from
all the evils of the world.

895
00:51:51,149 --> 00:51:54,482
I refuse to be
disassociated from that.

896
00:51:56,755 --> 00:51:58,985
All these people, you know,

897
00:51:59,057 --> 00:52:00,922
sitting around being offended
by their own meaninglessness.

898
00:52:00,992 --> 00:52:02,152
What am I asking?

899
00:52:02,227 --> 00:52:04,957
I'm asking for your
goddamn hotel security

900
00:52:05,030 --> 00:52:06,520
to keep these assholes out of the lobby.

901
00:52:06,598 --> 00:52:09,590
What? What?

902
00:52:09,668 --> 00:52:13,035
And you, sir, are one of the dumbest assholes
and most stupid persons

903
00:52:13,104 --> 00:52:15,470
I've ever spoken to
in my life, understand?

904
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:17,201
What?

905
00:52:17,275 --> 00:52:19,175
Well, I certainly hope so.

906
00:52:19,244 --> 00:52:20,939
Son of a bitch English bastard.

907
00:52:21,012 --> 00:52:22,206
Meaningless is right.

908
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:24,373
Do you think the average cat
who works eight hours a day

909
00:52:24,449 --> 00:52:27,145
gives a tit what I do?

910
00:52:27,219 --> 00:52:30,017
Anyway, it's not going
to keep me in heaven

911
00:52:30,088 --> 00:52:33,319
or out of the fiery furnace, that's for sure.

912
00:52:33,391 --> 00:52:35,018
Not gonna make me happy.

913
00:52:35,093 --> 00:52:36,856
Let me see that.

914
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:43,964
Whoa, there she is again,
your little debutante.

915
00:52:44,035 --> 00:52:45,900
No way, man.

916
00:52:45,971 --> 00:52:48,838
Is that Andy's new bird?
Coco something?

917
00:52:48,907 --> 00:52:50,033
Rivington.

918
00:52:50,108 --> 00:52:54,044
Coco Rivington Rockefeller,
Mrs. Howell III.

919
00:52:54,112 --> 00:52:57,445
She's queen of the underground,
and I don't mean tube.

920
00:52:57,516 --> 00:53:00,815
She's got good style.

921
00:53:00,886 --> 00:53:03,047
- I'd ball her.
- Be my guest.

922
00:53:03,121 --> 00:53:06,022
I think she's even here in, uh, London.

923
00:53:06,091 --> 00:53:07,718
She's here?

924
00:53:07,792 --> 00:53:09,089
So you dated her, did you?

925
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:11,424
Never. That girl's trouble.

926
00:53:11,496 --> 00:53:13,157
Will you invite her to the party?

927
00:53:13,231 --> 00:53:15,995
Sure. I always invite trouble.

928
00:53:38,690 --> 00:53:42,023
<i># I'm beginning to hear voices #</i>

929
00:53:46,665 --> 00:53:49,395
<i># And there's no one around #</i>

930
00:53:54,639 --> 00:53:57,472
<i># Well, I'm all used up #</i>

931
00:53:59,311 --> 00:54:00,869
<i># Yeah #</i>

932
00:54:02,981 --> 00:54:05,575
<i># And the fields
have turned brown #</i>

933
00:54:07,719 --> 00:54:09,687
Hold on a sec. There's someone at the door.

934
00:54:09,754 --> 00:54:11,016
If it's that fucking concierge again,

935
00:54:11,089 --> 00:54:12,078
I swear to God...

936
00:54:12,157 --> 00:54:14,921
Yeah, who is it?

937
00:54:14,993 --> 00:54:16,290
They're going to have to come up

938
00:54:16,361 --> 00:54:18,693
with some different numbers
if they want this to work.

939
00:54:18,763 --> 00:54:20,526
No. Stu...

940
00:54:20,599 --> 00:54:22,897
I'm not going to talk
about this all goddamn day.

941
00:54:22,968 --> 00:54:24,868
"Puffing heavily on his cigarette,

942
00:54:24,936 --> 00:54:26,267
he smokes 80 a day."

943
00:54:26,338 --> 00:54:27,930
Sinatra wants it.

944
00:54:28,006 --> 00:54:31,840
God. I'm glad I'm not me.

945
00:54:31,910 --> 00:54:34,174
Hey! I've got something to say to you.

946
00:54:34,245 --> 00:54:36,372
- Whoa!
- Hey, fuck off!

947
00:54:36,448 --> 00:54:38,040
- It's him I'm talkin' at.
- Yeah, I'm listenin', man.

948
00:54:38,116 --> 00:54:40,380
- Traitor! You wanker!
- Listen, pal.

949
00:54:40,452 --> 00:54:42,784
If you know what's good for you, you'll turn
right around and get the fuck out of here.

950
00:54:42,854 --> 00:54:45,379
Come on. Hey!

951
00:54:45,457 --> 00:54:46,685
Hurry up.

952
00:54:46,758 --> 00:54:49,454
Jason! You got to get in here, man.
You better hurry.

953
00:54:49,527 --> 00:54:52,462
- It's your boy I want.
- Put that knife down. You hear me?

954
00:54:53,465 --> 00:54:55,296
- Hey, man.
- Jesus Christ.

955
00:54:55,367 --> 00:54:58,063
Are you out of your fuckin' mind?
What are you gonna do? Stab us all?

956
00:54:58,136 --> 00:55:00,536
It's his fault! He's the one.

957
00:55:00,605 --> 00:55:01,799
Stabbing truth in the eye.

958
00:55:01,873 --> 00:55:03,500
I'm listening.
What's the truth, man?

959
00:55:03,575 --> 00:55:06,237
Easy, easy, easy.
Now just put that down...

960
00:55:06,311 --> 00:55:08,108
No! Walk away.

961
00:55:08,179 --> 00:55:10,374
- Just relax.
- Hey, back up.

962
00:55:10,448 --> 00:55:12,040
Either be groovy or leave, man.

963
00:55:19,791 --> 00:55:21,122
- Is he okay?
- Yeah.

964
00:55:21,192 --> 00:55:22,591
Everybody all right?

965
00:55:22,661 --> 00:55:26,028
- Thanks for steppin' in.
- My pleasure.

966
00:55:26,097 --> 00:55:28,725
Just like a woman.

967
00:55:55,093 --> 00:55:58,460
<i># They sat together in the park #</i>

968
00:55:58,530 --> 00:56:01,988
<i># As the evening sky grew dark #</i>

969
00:56:02,067 --> 00:56:05,264
<i># She looked at him
and he felt a spark #</i>

970
00:56:05,336 --> 00:56:08,271
<i># Tingle to his bones #</i>

971
00:56:09,374 --> 00:56:11,808
<i># 'Twas then he felt alone #</i>

972
00:56:11,876 --> 00:56:16,074
<i># And wished that he'd gone straight #</i>

973
00:56:16,147 --> 00:56:20,049
<i># And watched out
for a simple twist of fate #</i>

974
00:56:23,521 --> 00:56:27,048
<i># They walked along
by the old canal #</i>

975
00:56:27,125 --> 00:56:29,593
<i># A little confused, I remember well #</i>

976
00:56:29,661 --> 00:56:31,788
Claire! Claire, honey,
you got to meet someone.

977
00:56:31,863 --> 00:56:34,661
Hang on a second. Am I shitting you?

978
00:56:34,733 --> 00:56:38,134
- Dirty son of a gun.
- Claire, this is Sidney Green.

979
00:56:38,203 --> 00:56:40,171
A very bad old friend of mine.

980
00:56:40,238 --> 00:56:41,728
Hello.

981
00:56:41,806 --> 00:56:43,535
She's a doll. Actress.

982
00:56:43,608 --> 00:56:46,168
Uh, no, a painter. She's unbelievable.

983
00:56:46,244 --> 00:56:47,575
And Sid's a collector.

984
00:56:47,645 --> 00:56:49,613
What do you paint, honey?

985
00:56:49,681 --> 00:56:53,014
Oh, they're... They're abstracts,

986
00:56:53,084 --> 00:56:55,052
- most of what I do.
- She's French?

987
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:57,554
Aw, for cryin' out loud.

988
00:56:57,622 --> 00:57:00,716
Oh, oh. It's Mailer.

989
00:57:00,792 --> 00:57:03,420
Norman Mailer?

990
00:57:06,564 --> 00:57:08,725
Abstracts, huh?

991
00:57:16,341 --> 00:57:19,833
<i># People tell me it's a sin #</i>

992
00:57:19,911 --> 00:57:23,142
<i># To know and feel too much within #</i>

993
00:57:23,214 --> 00:57:26,377
<i># I still believe she was my twin #</i>

994
00:57:26,451 --> 00:57:29,147
<i># But I lost the ring #</i>

995
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:32,747
<i># She was born in the spring #</i>

996
00:57:32,824 --> 00:57:36,783
<i># But I was born too late #</i>

997
00:57:36,861 --> 00:57:40,558
<i># Blame it on a simple twist of fate #</i>

998
00:57:53,411 --> 00:57:57,643
Silence, experience shows,

999
00:57:57,741 --> 00:58:01,438
is what terrifies people most.

1000
00:58:19,263 --> 00:58:21,458
If he said he'll be here, he'll be here.

1001
00:58:21,532 --> 00:58:24,228
It's just such a terribly important booking.

1002
00:58:24,301 --> 00:58:25,859
Keenan seldom interviews.

1003
00:58:25,936 --> 00:58:27,460
He's really more of
an opinion maker really,

1004
00:58:27,538 --> 00:58:31,065
on the telly, so, there's
apt to be no time at all.

1005
00:58:31,141 --> 00:58:33,769
Is there a handler?
Someone who looks after him?

1006
00:58:33,844 --> 00:58:36,574
I told you, he and John
and Paul and George...

1007
00:58:36,647 --> 00:58:39,616
Yes, but did he ever get back?

1008
00:58:39,683 --> 00:58:41,548
- Pardon me.
- What?

1009
00:58:41,618 --> 00:58:44,143
Do you know if Jude
Quinn is in attendance?

1010
00:58:44,221 --> 00:58:45,245
The country-western singer?

1011
00:58:45,322 --> 00:58:47,722
No time for autographs, dearie.

1012
00:58:49,159 --> 00:58:51,423
- What's that over there?
- Where?

1013
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:57,265
Do the Watusi, John!

1014
00:58:59,970 --> 00:59:03,098
Whoa!

1015
00:59:03,173 --> 00:59:04,731
Mr. Quinn?

1016
00:59:04,808 --> 00:59:06,673
Mr. Quinn, yoo-hoo.

1017
00:59:08,445 --> 00:59:12,313
Yes, Mr. Quinn, hello!
We're all just here at the car. No worries.

1018
00:59:13,317 --> 00:59:16,115
Good. Sayonara.

1019
00:59:22,859 --> 00:59:24,121
Mother. Mother.

1020
00:59:24,194 --> 00:59:26,185
Oh, Mr. Quinn! What a privilege

1021
00:59:26,263 --> 00:59:27,821
to have in our midst...

1022
00:59:27,898 --> 00:59:31,891
...a true visionary, and such a splendid
example to the youth.

1023
00:59:31,969 --> 00:59:35,496
And such marvelous songs.
So truly wonderful.

1024
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:36,869
- Howdy.
- Our dear friend,

1025
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:38,965
Carolyn Hester, the folk singer?

1026
00:59:39,042 --> 00:59:41,476
She was saying,
just the other day, how liberating

1027
00:59:41,545 --> 00:59:44,275
what you're doing really is
for all... Mr. Quinn, hello!

1028
00:59:44,348 --> 00:59:46,475
Ma'am, I'm terribly sorry.

1029
00:59:46,550 --> 00:59:49,383
Carolyn said that? You tell Carolyn
to come see me anytime,

1030
00:59:49,453 --> 00:59:51,353
now that she's, uh, liberated.

1031
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:54,447
Jude, you know, like in the song
"Generation Dungeon,"

1032
00:59:54,524 --> 00:59:56,389
when you say "he has the eyes of a camel

1033
00:59:56,460 --> 00:59:59,122
- and sleeps on a hook..." That's Victor, right?
- Mr. Quinn!

1034
00:59:59,196 --> 01:00:02,495
'Cause I saw a picture of him once
in a magazine, smoking Camels,

1035
01:00:02,566 --> 01:00:04,363
which I know
Danny Ronk used to smoke,

1036
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:06,368
but then he switched
to Lucky Strikes in '64.

1037
01:00:06,436 --> 01:00:09,064
Mr. Quinn, we really ought to hurry.
Everyone's at the car!

1038
01:00:09,139 --> 01:00:10,629
<i>...till early '65.
- Norman, Mona, Sammy...</i>

1039
01:00:10,707 --> 01:00:13,301
Sammy? Who's Sammy?

1040
01:00:13,377 --> 01:00:15,868
Sonny. Sonny Dover.

1041
01:00:15,946 --> 01:00:18,005
The central doyen of the inner circle,

1042
01:00:18,081 --> 01:00:20,140
and Jude's oldest ally.

1043
01:00:20,217 --> 01:00:22,515
He plays maracas
on "Medicine Sunday."

1044
01:00:22,586 --> 01:00:25,248
Judey! Lover boy! Ah!

1045
01:00:25,322 --> 01:00:29,884
Two words on Shakespeare,
Mr. Quinn, for our listeners.

1046
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:32,019
Two words?

1047
01:00:32,095 --> 01:00:33,892
Raving queen,

1048
01:00:33,964 --> 01:00:36,159
and cosmic amphetamine brain.

1049
01:00:36,233 --> 01:00:38,428
I dig Shakespeare.

1050
01:00:38,502 --> 01:00:39,833
I have a question for Mr. Quinn.

1051
01:00:39,903 --> 01:00:41,837
Oh, Keenan, please
forgive us. Mr. Quinn,

1052
01:00:41,905 --> 01:00:44,135
allow me to introduce to you
Mr. Keenan Jones,

1053
01:00:44,207 --> 01:00:46,175
arts editor and host of the BBC.

1054
01:00:46,243 --> 01:00:47,369
I remember you.

1055
01:00:47,444 --> 01:00:49,742
Yes, I was going to ask
Mr. Quinn why he insists

1056
01:00:49,813 --> 01:00:53,271
on putting us and the rest
of the world on so?

1057
01:00:53,350 --> 01:00:55,944
Some might be persuaded
to doubt his sincerity.

1058
01:00:56,019 --> 01:00:59,250
Well, who said I was sincere?

1059
01:00:59,322 --> 01:01:02,689
Are you saying you're not sincere?

1060
01:01:02,759 --> 01:01:05,660
No more than you, you know?

1061
01:01:05,729 --> 01:01:07,287
No more sincere than you are.

1062
01:01:09,166 --> 01:01:13,102
See, you just want me to say
what you want me to say.

1063
01:01:20,410 --> 01:01:21,775
You might think

1064
01:01:21,845 --> 01:01:24,075
nothing can reach
those tens of thousands,

1065
01:01:24,147 --> 01:01:26,672
living by the dollar.

1066
01:01:28,985 --> 01:01:31,044
But you'd be wrong.

1067
01:01:37,094 --> 01:01:40,894
Hey. What are you doin' here?

1068
01:01:44,167 --> 01:01:46,499
You alone?

1069
01:01:46,570 --> 01:01:49,630
Now, why would that be
any concern of yours?

1070
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:53,665
Look, I'm sorry about what happened.

1071
01:01:53,744 --> 01:01:56,611
- Nothing happened.
- Fine. Nothing happened.

1072
01:01:58,448 --> 01:02:01,349
Oh, come on.
I was straight with you.

1073
01:02:01,418 --> 01:02:03,716
I thought you had no recollection.

1074
01:02:03,787 --> 01:02:07,917
Look, I can't recall
San Francisco at all.

1075
01:02:07,991 --> 01:02:09,891
And I can't really
remember El Paso,

1076
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:12,258
but you shouldn't take
it all so personal.

1077
01:02:12,329 --> 01:02:15,059
I don't, believe me.

1078
01:02:15,132 --> 01:02:18,499
My current situation far precedes
anything from the past.

1079
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:22,261
But you never know how
the past will turn out.

1080
01:02:22,339 --> 01:02:24,773
Sorry.

1081
01:02:24,841 --> 01:02:26,968
But your kisses are nothing like his.

1082
01:02:27,043 --> 01:02:28,908
I bet.

1083
01:02:28,979 --> 01:02:32,107
- Anyone I know?
- Good one.

1084
01:02:32,182 --> 01:02:35,709
No, your lucky tongue will not decay me.

1085
01:02:35,786 --> 01:02:38,311
Fine, you take your glands,
and your medallions,

1086
01:02:38,388 --> 01:02:40,549
and make love for once, freely.

1087
01:02:40,624 --> 01:02:43,752
So that's what you think
you have over everyone.

1088
01:02:43,827 --> 01:02:48,821
Freedom.

1089
01:02:51,201 --> 01:02:53,999
I just got to clean up a little bit.

1090
01:02:55,972 --> 01:02:57,599
And I'll be fine.

1091
01:02:57,674 --> 01:03:00,234
Here's a tip: Use your fists.

1092
01:03:01,244 --> 01:03:03,212
Very funny, Coco.

1093
01:03:06,883 --> 01:03:09,681
Hey, Coco!

1094
01:03:09,753 --> 01:03:12,745
Coco!

1095
01:03:19,729 --> 01:03:22,197
You look and sound very tired, very ill.

1096
01:03:22,265 --> 01:03:23,892
Is this your normal state?

1097
01:03:23,967 --> 01:03:25,730
I take that as an insult.

1098
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:30,330
Do you suffer from sore eyes,
groovy foreheads, and curly hair?

1099
01:03:30,407 --> 01:03:32,341
Take Zoomdom!

1100
01:03:32,409 --> 01:03:36,812
Hey. Hey, isn't that
what's-his-name, the poet?

1101
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:39,678
- Ginsberg?
- Allen Ginsberg?

1102
01:03:39,749 --> 01:03:42,013
Oh, my God! It is!

1103
01:03:43,186 --> 01:03:44,744
Wait a minute.

1104
01:03:51,595 --> 01:03:54,428
Hey! Allen thought
that was you in there!

1105
01:03:54,497 --> 01:03:56,692
I don't think you two have met.

1106
01:03:56,766 --> 01:04:00,258
- Hi.
- Hey.

1107
01:04:00,337 --> 01:04:02,168
Allen, tell him what you said to that reporter,

1108
01:04:02,239 --> 01:04:04,935
the one that asked
if you thought that Jude had sold out.

1109
01:04:05,008 --> 01:04:06,339
<i>What, they're asking you?</i>

1110
01:04:06,409 --> 01:04:11,005
I said I didn't know.
Perhaps you sold out to God.

1111
01:04:11,081 --> 01:04:14,517
What's that even mean?

1112
01:04:14,584 --> 01:04:17,747
Well, if your mission
was to see whether

1113
01:04:17,821 --> 01:04:20,517
you could do great art on a juke box,

1114
01:04:20,590 --> 01:04:22,524
well, you know, then we all benefited.

1115
01:04:22,592 --> 01:04:26,926
Profited, you said, by his coercion.

1116
01:04:26,997 --> 01:04:30,956
That was it. So. What now?

1117
01:04:31,034 --> 01:04:34,663
Now? What's left?

1118
01:04:34,738 --> 01:04:38,469
Oh, my salvation?

1119
01:04:38,541 --> 01:04:41,635
Well, see what we could do.

1120
01:04:47,751 --> 01:04:49,912
Oh, he'll give it to you!

1121
01:04:52,322 --> 01:04:56,190
That was Allen Ginsberg, man!

1122
01:04:56,259 --> 01:04:59,558
See ya later, Allen Ginsberg.

1123
01:05:02,098 --> 01:05:03,565
Would you say, then,

1124
01:05:03,633 --> 01:05:04,600
that the collective struggles

1125
01:05:04,668 --> 01:05:06,932
of the color discrimination
or the war have failed,

1126
01:05:07,003 --> 01:05:09,062
or as I believe you inferred earlier,

1127
01:05:09,139 --> 01:05:11,164
do you think it's the process
itself that's at fault?

1128
01:05:11,241 --> 01:05:14,972
Who cares what I think?
I'm not the president.

1129
01:05:15,045 --> 01:05:18,412
I'm not some shepherd.
I'm just a storyteller, man.

1130
01:05:18,481 --> 01:05:20,745
- It's all I am.
- Well, certainly.

1131
01:05:20,817 --> 01:05:23,251
But as someone
who once cared deeply,

1132
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:26,221
as a storyteller, as...

1133
01:05:26,289 --> 01:05:30,123
for social justice, equality...
certainly you still care as a human being.

1134
01:05:31,895 --> 01:05:35,331
Well, why? Why?

1135
01:05:37,267 --> 01:05:38,859
I mean, what do you care?

1136
01:05:38,935 --> 01:05:41,904
If I care, or I don't care, what's it to you?

1137
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:47,132
All right, what if I said
I never cared about, you know, folk music?

1138
01:05:47,210 --> 01:05:49,110
About, you know, protest songs?

1139
01:05:49,179 --> 01:05:51,010
It was all about jumping into a scene.

1140
01:05:53,116 --> 01:05:56,643
You know, I was never
gonna stay there. I mean, I just...

1141
01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:59,553
I knew I could do it
better than anybody else.

1142
01:05:59,622 --> 01:06:01,590
Well, I don't believe you.

1143
01:06:01,658 --> 01:06:04,058
No, I mean, you know,
what matters to me...

1144
01:06:04,127 --> 01:06:06,721
you know, it matters
what's happening now.

1145
01:06:06,796 --> 01:06:09,196
Does it matter to you when
songs you're writing now

1146
01:06:09,265 --> 01:06:11,290
are being used as recruitment tools

1147
01:06:11,368 --> 01:06:14,201
for militant street gangs,
like the all-Negro faction in the United States?

1148
01:06:14,270 --> 01:06:15,294
Oh, yeah.

1149
01:06:15,372 --> 01:06:17,067
A group that promotes precisely
the kind of violence

1150
01:06:17,140 --> 01:06:18,607
your earlier songs oppose?

1151
01:06:18,675 --> 01:06:21,143
If you're asking me, man, am I a member
of the Black Panther Party,

1152
01:06:21,211 --> 01:06:24,203
the answer's no.

1153
01:06:26,282 --> 01:06:30,082
Man, I can't really tell you how I care.

1154
01:06:30,153 --> 01:06:32,053
Well, I presume at the very least

1155
01:06:32,122 --> 01:06:35,649
that you care something
about what you sing every night.

1156
01:06:35,725 --> 01:06:39,058
What are you...
How can I answer that,

1157
01:06:39,129 --> 01:06:41,791
if you got the nerve to ask me?

1158
01:06:41,865 --> 01:06:44,663
I mean, you've got a lot of nerve,
asking me a question like that.

1159
01:06:44,734 --> 01:06:47,498
- Do you ask the Beatles that?
- Do I...

1160
01:06:47,570 --> 01:06:50,368
- Or Mr. Eve of Destruction?
- Would you ask Barry McGuire that?

1161
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:53,068
I have to ask, because you have the nerve
to question whether I care.

1162
01:06:53,143 --> 01:06:55,338
I'm not questioning you because I don't
expect any answers from you.

1163
01:06:55,412 --> 01:06:57,437
Maybe Victor Mature.
He looks like Victor Mature.

1164
01:06:57,514 --> 01:07:00,677
More like Elsa Lanchester,
man, with a North Mexican kind of thing.

1165
01:07:00,750 --> 01:07:03,275
That's very protest-y, man.
You know, it's very very protest-y.

1166
01:07:03,353 --> 01:07:06,686
You know, I am convinced of one thing.
You either do care about nothing at all,

1167
01:07:06,756 --> 01:07:08,849
or tremendously much
that people think so.

1168
01:07:08,992 --> 01:07:12,018
And you ask for my time?

1169
01:07:13,830 --> 01:07:16,298
Mr. Quinn, we really do need you in...

1170
01:07:16,366 --> 01:07:19,927
Listen, I know more about you, right,
than you will ever know about me.

1171
01:07:20,003 --> 01:07:23,131
You think I give a crumpet
what you write in your lousy paper?

1172
01:07:23,206 --> 01:07:26,073
Now, I don't need to look to someone else,
man, to tell me I'm good.

1173
01:07:26,142 --> 01:07:28,235
Slaughter me, for all I care.

1174
01:07:28,311 --> 01:07:29,938
I refuse to be hurt.

1175
01:07:30,013 --> 01:07:32,004
Mr. Quinn, we really
do need you in the car.

1176
01:07:32,082 --> 01:07:33,379
Hey, man.

1177
01:07:33,450 --> 01:07:35,645
You refuse feeling deeply about anything.

1178
01:07:35,718 --> 01:07:38,551
It's clear to anyone
how entirely self-conscious you are,

1179
01:07:38,621 --> 01:07:40,020
in everything you do.

1180
01:07:40,090 --> 01:07:41,921
- That's enough!
- Feeling deeply?

1181
01:07:41,991 --> 01:07:44,653
That's what this is about?

1182
01:07:44,727 --> 01:07:48,094
What precisely, please do tell,
am I supposed to be feeling, huh?

1183
01:07:48,164 --> 01:07:50,428
I'm simply referring
to standard emotions:

1184
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:53,697
Pain, remorse, love.

1185
01:07:53,770 --> 01:07:56,603
Yeah, I have none of those feelings.

1186
01:08:40,150 --> 01:08:42,983
<i># You walk into the room #</i>

1187
01:08:43,052 --> 01:08:46,886

01:10:12,909 --> 01:10:16,037
# Out there among the lumberjacks #

1211
01:10:16,112 --> 01:10:18,774
<i># To get you the facts
when someone attacks #</i>

1212
01:10:18,848 --> 01:10:21,510
<i># Your imagination #</i>

1213
01:10:23,019 --> 01:10:26,216
# No one has any respect #

1214
01:10:26,289 --> 01:10:28,621
# Anyway, they always expect #

1215
01:10:28,691 --> 01:10:31,660
<i># You'll just give a check #</i>

1216
01:10:31,728 --> 01:10:37,360
<i># To tax-deductible
charity organizations #</i>

1217
01:10:40,336 --> 01:10:42,861
# Well #

1218
01:10:42,939 --> 01:10:45,874
# You been with the professors #

1219
01:10:45,942 --> 01:10:49,673
# And they all like your looks #

1220
01:10:49,746 --> 01:10:52,874
# And with great lawyers you have #

1221
01:10:52,949 --> 01:10:56,009
# Discussed lepers and crooks #

1222
01:10:56,085 --> 01:10:59,213
# You've been through all of #

1223
01:10:59,289 --> 01:11:02,588
# F. Scott Fitzgerald's books #

1224
01:11:02,659 --> 01:11:07,096
# You're very well read,
yeah, it's well known #

1225
01:11:08,865 --> 01:11:12,392
# Because something
is still happening here #

1226
01:11:12,468 --> 01:11:15,130
# You don't know what it is #

1227
01:11:15,204 --> 01:11:17,764
# Do you #

1228
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:20,434
# Mr. Jones? #

1229
01:11:26,516 --> 01:11:29,542
<i># Well, the sword swallower #</i>

1230
01:11:29,619 --> 01:11:33,214
<i># He comes up to you
and then he kneels #</i>

1231
01:11:33,289 --> 01:11:36,349
<i># He crosses himself #</i>

1232
01:11:36,426 --> 01:11:39,827
<i># And then he clicks his high heels #</i>

1233
01:11:39,896 --> 01:11:42,558
<i># Without further notice #</i>

1234
01:11:42,632 --> 01:11:45,294
<i># He tells you how it feels #</i>

1235
01:11:45,368 --> 01:11:48,735
<i># Then he says,
"Here's your mouth back #</i>

1236
01:11:48,805 --> 01:11:50,295
<i># Thanks for the loan" #</i>

1237
01:11:50,373 --> 01:11:52,136
Stop. Stop the song.

1238
01:11:52,208 --> 01:11:54,403
<i># And you kno... #</i>

1239
01:11:54,477 --> 01:11:57,071
Well, I missed it. I missed it again.

1240
01:11:57,146 --> 01:11:58,511
I missed it.

1241
01:11:58,581 --> 01:11:59,809
Bobby, now you ain't hearin' me, man.

1242
01:11:59,882 --> 01:12:02,180
No, we are the geeks. You dig?

1243
01:12:02,251 --> 01:12:03,843
But then why is that cool?

1244
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:06,354
No, man, we are the ones
being paraded around

1245
01:12:06,422 --> 01:12:08,253
like some sort of circus freaks.

1246
01:12:08,324 --> 01:12:09,791
"Come on up and see Harlem,
Mr. Jones,

1247
01:12:09,859 --> 01:12:11,918
but make sure your window's
rolled up tight."

1248
01:12:11,994 --> 01:12:14,155
This song is hell, man.
You've got to understand,

1249
01:12:14,230 --> 01:12:18,098
this song is saying
a hell of a lot about society.

1250
01:12:18,167 --> 01:12:20,192
All power to all people,
man, that's what it's saying.

1251
01:12:20,269 --> 01:12:21,531
- I missed it again.
- Bobby.

1252
01:12:21,604 --> 01:12:23,401
Aw, Bobby nothing.
Just play it again, Huey.

1253
01:12:23,473 --> 01:12:25,873
Let's play it one more time.

1254
01:12:27,009 --> 01:12:30,001
# Because something
is happenin' here #

1255
01:12:30,079 --> 01:12:33,207
# And you don't know what it is #

1256
01:12:33,282 --> 01:12:36,183
# Do you #

1257
01:12:36,252 --> 01:12:38,743
# Mr. Jones? #

1258
01:12:59,041 --> 01:13:02,772
You know, this is music.

1259
01:13:02,845 --> 01:13:06,781
You know, what you're hearing
is not English music, all right?

1260
01:13:07,850 --> 01:13:09,545
You've never really heard
American music before.

1261
01:13:11,287 --> 01:13:14,154
And what you hear, obviously, right now,
doesn't have a name.

1262
01:13:14,223 --> 01:13:17,681
It's words, all right? And sounds.

1263
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:20,661
If it's something
you disagree with, that's great.

1264
01:13:21,964 --> 01:13:23,932
Judas!

1265
01:13:28,838 --> 01:13:31,363
I don't believe you.

1266
01:13:31,441 --> 01:13:33,466
Judas!

1267
01:13:36,579 --> 01:13:38,877
Come up here and say that.

1268
01:13:41,050 --> 01:13:43,280
You're liars, all of you.

1269
01:13:54,397 --> 01:13:57,628
I accept chaos.

1270
01:14:00,837 --> 01:14:02,737
I'm not sure whether it accepts me.

1271
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:14,748
We hadn't spoken in a long while.

1272
01:14:14,817 --> 01:14:19,447
I think he was involved
with someone, actually...

1273
01:14:19,522 --> 01:14:21,285
He said something to me on the phone

1274
01:14:21,357 --> 01:14:24,053
about angels hanging off of buildings,

1275
01:14:24,126 --> 01:14:26,651
which was frightening.

1276
01:14:26,729 --> 01:14:28,754
I thought he was hallucinating.

1277
01:14:30,199 --> 01:14:33,063
That was the last I heard.

1278
01:14:33,135 --> 01:14:37,663
It was like what people say
about Billy the Kid...

1279
01:14:37,740 --> 01:14:40,368
that he really just dodged
a bullet and went into hiding.

1280
01:14:41,978 --> 01:14:45,812
And Jack, he always
loved Billy the Kid.

1281
01:14:45,882 --> 01:14:48,783
Whoo!

1282
01:14:52,255 --> 01:14:54,223
Henry.

1283
01:15:03,933 --> 01:15:05,491
What the hell's wrong with you?

1284
01:15:09,772 --> 01:15:12,639
<i>Paper said Pat Garrett tracked me down.</i>

1285
01:15:12,708 --> 01:15:14,539
<i>Stopped me dead.</i>

1286
01:15:14,610 --> 01:15:17,909
<i>That outlaws always die.</i>

1287
01:15:17,980 --> 01:15:20,813
<i>Only a fool would believe
what they read in the papers.</i>

1288
01:15:22,351 --> 01:15:23,841
Come on.

1289
01:15:32,395 --> 01:15:36,354
<i>Here, I'm invisible.</i>

1290
01:15:37,934 --> 01:15:39,834
Come on, now.

1291
01:15:46,142 --> 01:15:48,042
<i>Even to myself.</i>

1292
01:16:14,370 --> 01:16:16,930
Henry! Calm yourself down.

1293
01:16:17,006 --> 01:16:18,234
Gettin' everybody zigaboo here.

1294
01:16:20,009 --> 01:16:21,806
Henry. Henry! Henry!

1295
01:16:21,877 --> 01:16:24,744
Come on back here! Henry!

1296
01:16:24,814 --> 01:16:26,805
You get back here!

1297
01:16:28,150 --> 01:16:31,449
<i>And here, by the road
where nobody goes,</i>

1298
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:33,044
<i>where it causes no worry,</i>

1299
01:16:33,122 --> 01:16:36,853
<i>where the show must go on,</i>

1300
01:16:36,926 --> 01:16:38,894
<i>is where I'll die.</i>

1301
01:16:53,376 --> 01:16:56,072
Henry! Come back here!

1302
01:16:56,145 --> 01:16:58,375
Henry! Come back here!

1303
01:17:56,238 --> 01:17:59,765
<i># There must be some kind
of way out of here #</i>

1304
01:17:59,842 --> 01:18:03,676
<i># Said the joker to the thief #</i>

1305
01:18:03,746 --> 01:18:07,341
<i># There's too much confusion #</i>

1306
01:18:07,416 --> 01:18:11,409
<i># I can't get no relief #</i>

1307
01:18:11,487 --> 01:18:14,149
<i># Two riders are approaching #</i>

1308
01:18:14,223 --> 01:18:17,954
<i># And the wind began to howl #</i>

1309
01:18:32,775 --> 01:18:35,369
Henry! Henry!

1310
01:18:35,444 --> 01:18:37,071
God damn it, get back here!

1311
01:18:37,146 --> 01:18:39,410
Hey! Come back, Henry!

1312
01:18:39,482 --> 01:18:40,915
Come on, now.

1313
01:18:43,753 --> 01:18:45,687
<i>How long had it been?</i>

1314
01:18:45,755 --> 01:18:47,052
<i>I couldn't even say.</i>

1315
01:18:49,291 --> 01:18:52,522
<i>The day I arrived looks a lot like today.</i>

1316
01:18:56,065 --> 01:18:58,329
<i>Least, that's how it seemed at the time.</i>

1317
01:19:24,193 --> 01:19:26,491
Homer, is that you?

1318
01:19:26,562 --> 01:19:29,030
Mr. B.

1319
01:19:33,002 --> 01:19:34,936
What's the trouble, there?

1320
01:19:35,004 --> 01:19:37,199
A useless bag of thumbs what I am.

1321
01:19:39,141 --> 01:19:41,837
There you go.

1322
01:19:41,911 --> 01:19:45,005
Sellin' off whatnot.

1323
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:47,241
Mm-hmm.

1324
01:19:47,316 --> 01:19:51,514
Well, ain't seen no
yellow dog runnin' loose

1325
01:19:51,587 --> 01:19:53,248
by any chance, have you?

1326
01:19:54,290 --> 01:19:56,190
Old Henry tore off on me.

1327
01:19:56,258 --> 01:19:58,590
- What, she get spooked?
- Seemed to.

1328
01:19:58,661 --> 01:20:00,424
Why? Critters know what's goin' on.

1329
01:20:00,496 --> 01:20:03,624
- What do they know?
- Well, for one, they know

1330
01:20:03,699 --> 01:20:05,530
Shadow Valley's gettin'
blown to kingdom come.

1331
01:20:05,601 --> 01:20:10,163
What, that old highway plan?
No, never had a chance.

1332
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:12,400
You mean, you really ain't heard?

1333
01:20:12,474 --> 01:20:14,840
Heard what?

1334
01:20:14,910 --> 01:20:17,845
Mr. B, that plan's official.
It's gone through.

1335
01:20:17,913 --> 01:20:20,143
Last Tuesday, they all come.
Old Man Garrett and them bunch?

1336
01:20:20,216 --> 01:20:21,683
Wavin' all sorts of papers?

1337
01:20:21,750 --> 01:20:23,684
- I never seen such a stupor.
- What are you talkin' about?

1338
01:20:23,752 --> 01:20:25,777
- Wh-What's official?
- Six-laner headed

1339
01:20:25,855 --> 01:20:27,413
straight through
the heart of Shadow Valley.

1340
01:20:27,489 --> 01:20:29,957
Commissioner Garrett done
give us 30 days come November.

1341
01:20:30,025 --> 01:20:32,493
Why haven't I heard
nothing about this?

1342
01:20:32,561 --> 01:20:35,257
Mr. B, you don't get out much.

1343
01:20:35,331 --> 01:20:38,698
Don't sound credible to me, Homer.

1344
01:20:40,669 --> 01:20:43,570
What have people been saying?
They been doin' anything?

1345
01:20:43,639 --> 01:20:46,005
Well, first Charley Harper,
the zookeeper?

1346
01:20:46,075 --> 01:20:48,475
Shot hisself in the face in front of them

1347
01:20:48,544 --> 01:20:50,512
three maiden sisters
and two bachelor brothers.

1348
01:20:50,579 --> 01:20:52,513
Them all went insane on account.

1349
01:20:52,581 --> 01:20:54,378
Been five hangings, six Phenobarbitals,

1350
01:20:54,450 --> 01:20:56,748
and, well...

1351
01:20:56,819 --> 01:20:58,650
you familiar with young Clarice Henry?

1352
01:20:58,721 --> 01:21:00,382
Mrs. Henry, the Captain's girl?

1353
01:21:00,456 --> 01:21:02,822
Of course I am.

1354
01:21:02,892 --> 01:21:06,328
Well, what?

1355
01:21:06,328 --> 01:21:08,091
The Captain found her.

1356
01:21:08,163 --> 01:21:10,597
Throat cut.
By her own hand, they say.

1357
01:21:13,469 --> 01:21:16,233
Well, where you fixin' to?

1358
01:21:16,305 --> 01:21:19,604
Well, if it's true,

1359
01:21:19,675 --> 01:21:22,667
gonna pay my respects
to Captain and Mrs. Henry.

1360
01:21:22,745 --> 01:21:25,213
This whole thing's sounds
fishy to me. You comin'?

1361
01:21:25,281 --> 01:21:27,272
Oh, no. No, not today.

1362
01:21:28,584 --> 01:21:32,384
- Shameful day.
- Suit yourself.

1363
01:21:32,454 --> 01:21:37,153
Anyway, Charley gone,
and all of his brothers,

1364
01:21:37,226 --> 01:21:38,818
who's mindin' the zoo?

1365
01:21:41,230 --> 01:21:43,061
Homer?

1366
01:21:46,101 --> 01:21:47,466
<i>1968.</i>

1367
01:21:47,536 --> 01:21:49,766
<i>America watched its war plan collapse,</i>

1368
01:21:49,838 --> 01:21:51,772
<i>its cities burn, its youth erupt,</i>

1369
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:55,332
<i>its president crumble,
its greatest leaders fall slain.</i>

1370
01:21:55,411 --> 01:21:57,572
<i>And there we were.</i>

1371
01:21:57,646 --> 01:21:59,409
<i>All alone with Richard Nixon.</i>

1372
01:22:01,984 --> 01:22:03,212
No. No. Not at all.

1373
01:22:03,285 --> 01:22:06,482
Come on, face it. Face it, it's over.

1374
01:22:06,555 --> 01:22:08,819
All these groups
promoting the movement

1375
01:22:08,891 --> 01:22:11,883
are so full of their own
president, vice president,

1376
01:22:11,961 --> 01:22:14,293
- and secretary bullshit.
- Not at all.

1377
01:22:14,363 --> 01:22:15,921
They just think
it's all about them, man.

1378
01:22:15,998 --> 01:22:18,057
All these right-wing corporate hawks

1379
01:22:18,133 --> 01:22:20,465
plotting to invade the world,
and drug us to death

1380
01:22:20,536 --> 01:22:22,800
with happy pills and the Bible.

1381
01:22:22,871 --> 01:22:25,704
- It ain't gonna happen.
- I never said that.

1382
01:22:25,774 --> 01:22:29,005
What are you talking about?
You say it all the time.

1383
01:22:29,078 --> 01:22:31,945
I don't know. I think we all agree

1384
01:22:32,014 --> 01:22:34,005
that the world is
a terribly fucked-up place,

1385
01:22:34,083 --> 01:22:37,109
but I happen to feel that
there's something to be done

1386
01:22:37,186 --> 01:22:40,212
to change the situation, and you...

1387
01:22:40,289 --> 01:22:41,813
don't really sound like you...

1388
01:22:41,890 --> 01:22:45,326
He doesn't. Well...

1389
01:22:45,394 --> 01:22:49,228
Well, you want to know
why you think that?

1390
01:22:49,298 --> 01:22:52,267
That, uh, something can
be done to change things?

1391
01:22:52,334 --> 01:22:54,632
Why?

1392
01:22:54,703 --> 01:22:57,331
- Because you're a chick.
- Oh, Jesus, Robbie.

1393
01:22:57,406 --> 01:22:59,340
What's that supposed to mean?

1394
01:22:59,408 --> 01:23:01,103
Oh, forget it.

1395
01:23:03,545 --> 01:23:06,446
Son of a bitch.

1396
01:23:06,515 --> 01:23:09,006
So you're basically a chauvinist.

1397
01:23:09,084 --> 01:23:12,315
Why? Because I think guys
and chicks are different?

1398
01:23:12,388 --> 01:23:13,855
Come on, that's all I'm saying.

1399
01:23:13,922 --> 01:23:15,389
And they are.

1400
01:23:15,457 --> 01:23:18,051
They each have access
to different kinds of pain,

1401
01:23:18,127 --> 01:23:20,288
which is pretty much
why chicks can never be poets.

1402
01:23:20,362 --> 01:23:22,557
- Jesus!
- What?

1403
01:23:22,631 --> 01:23:24,121
Robbie, please,
you're not serious.

1404
01:23:24,199 --> 01:23:26,064
That's the most
preposterous thing I've ever heard.

1405
01:23:26,135 --> 01:23:27,067
Emily Dickinson.

1406
01:23:27,136 --> 01:23:28,797
No, that's not the same.

1407
01:23:28,871 --> 01:23:30,133
As what?

1408
01:23:30,205 --> 01:23:32,230
Whitman, Rimbaud, Shakespeare.

1409
01:23:32,307 --> 01:23:36,073
Grace is...
she's really big into Women's Lib.

1410
01:23:36,145 --> 01:23:38,136
Guys and chicks
are different, I'm sorry.

1411
01:23:38,213 --> 01:23:41,705
I cannot believe you're actually
saying these things.

1412
01:23:41,784 --> 01:23:45,811
I cannot believe you actually think
that women are incapable of...

1413
01:23:45,888 --> 01:23:47,116
Okay, okay, okay.

1414
01:23:47,189 --> 01:23:49,214
Let's try something, huh?

1415
01:23:50,893 --> 01:23:52,724
You write down the nastiest thing
you can think of,

1416
01:23:52,795 --> 01:23:56,788
and I'll write down the nastiest thing
I can think of, and...

1417
01:23:56,865 --> 01:23:58,890
- What?
- We'll compare.

1418
01:23:58,967 --> 01:24:01,458
- But what does that prove?
- Just do it.

1419
01:24:01,537 --> 01:24:03,095
- No.
- Claire, sit down.

1420
01:24:03,172 --> 01:24:04,230
No!

1421
01:24:04,306 --> 01:24:05,796
- No, no, no! I want to know...
- Come on, honey.

1422
01:24:05,874 --> 01:24:07,307
Play the game!

1423
01:24:07,376 --> 01:24:10,573
I want to know what this thing is
that women cannot experience or...

1424
01:24:10,646 --> 01:24:12,113
Cut the fucking snaps!

1425
01:24:12,181 --> 01:24:15,742
Or write about or talk about
or what, put on paper?

1426
01:24:15,818 --> 01:24:18,116
What is this place?

1427
01:24:18,187 --> 01:24:20,178
Do you own this place?

1428
01:24:20,255 --> 01:24:21,722
Did you invent it?

1429
01:24:21,790 --> 01:24:23,348
Uh, no, honey, I don't.

1430
01:24:23,425 --> 01:24:25,017
Claire, come on,
you're missing the point completely.

1431
01:24:25,094 --> 01:24:26,925
I-I worship women.

1432
01:24:26,995 --> 01:24:28,360
Everybody should have one.

1433
01:24:28,430 --> 01:24:30,125
- Yeah, fine.
- Claire!

1434
01:24:30,199 --> 01:24:33,566
Claire, come on. I was kidding.

1435
01:24:33,635 --> 01:24:34,932
Hey, God's a woman.

1436
01:24:36,305 --> 01:24:37,397
Claire.

1437
01:24:38,841 --> 01:24:39,773
Hey!

1438
01:24:39,842 --> 01:24:41,571
Fuck you, man!

1439
01:24:41,643 --> 01:24:42,974
What are you, fucking deaf?

1440
01:24:43,045 --> 01:24:45,206
I told you to stop fucking doing that.

1441
01:24:46,215 --> 01:24:47,477
Fuck.

1442
01:24:51,620 --> 01:24:53,212
What?

1443
01:24:55,190 --> 01:24:56,122
What?

1444
01:24:56,191 --> 01:24:57,658
Nothing.

1445
01:25:00,162 --> 01:25:02,187
You've changed.

1446
01:25:02,264 --> 01:25:03,231
Yeah. Fuck right, I've changed.

1447
01:25:03,298 --> 01:25:05,095
All of this... these new clothes,

1448
01:25:05,167 --> 01:25:06,828
new car, these shades.

1449
01:25:06,902 --> 01:25:08,233
You'd never wear shit like that before.

1450
01:25:08,303 --> 01:25:10,134
Man, you tell me I've changed

1451
01:25:10,205 --> 01:25:12,230
as if that's all there is to say,
you know,

1452
01:25:12,307 --> 01:25:13,296
in this completely different voice

1453
01:25:13,375 --> 01:25:15,843
than the one you had
ten minutes ago.

1454
01:25:15,911 --> 01:25:18,106
You know, kids shooting craps
in an L.A. Garage pot,

1455
01:25:18,180 --> 01:25:20,307
and you say nothing's perfect.

1456
01:25:20,382 --> 01:25:23,647
I say it again: There are no politics.

1457
01:25:25,087 --> 01:25:27,647
Right.

1458
01:25:27,723 --> 01:25:29,782
Well, then, what the fuck is there?

1459
01:25:29,858 --> 01:25:31,052
Huh?

1460
01:25:32,661 --> 01:25:34,026
Sign language.

1461
01:25:57,319 --> 01:25:59,310
<i>No town ever loved Halloween</i>

1462
01:25:59,388 --> 01:26:01,549
<i>like the town of Riddle.</i>

1463
01:26:01,623 --> 01:26:05,354
<i>So who a fellow really was never really
mattered.</i>

1464
01:26:07,095 --> 01:26:10,690
<i>Not with what pretending had to offer.</i>

1465
01:26:10,766 --> 01:26:12,791
<i>It was my kind of town.</i>

1466
01:26:12,868 --> 01:26:14,893
Hey, guys!
You should've seen me.

1467
01:26:14,970 --> 01:26:18,701
I come in like a Ferris wheel,
and, boys, I sure was slick.

1468
01:26:18,774 --> 01:26:21,834
What the heck
are you supposed to be?

1469
01:26:21,910 --> 01:26:24,037
Well, if you don't know,
I'm not gonna tell you.

1470
01:26:24,112 --> 01:26:26,637
<i># Your back is straight,

1471
01:26:26,715 --> 01:26:29,616
<i># On the pillow where you lie #</i>

01:26:31,253 --> 01:26:34,416
<i># But I don't sense affection #</i>

1473
01:26:34,489 --> 01:26:37,925
<i># No gratitude or love #</i>

1474
01:26:37,993 --> 01:26:40,757
<i># Your loyalty is not to me #</i>

1475
01:26:40,829 --> 01:26:44,629
<i># But to the stars above #</i>

1476
01:26:44,700 --> 01:26:49,865
<i># One more cup of coffee 'fore I go #</i>

1477
01:26:51,573 --> 01:26:57,409
<i># One more cup of coffee 'fore I go #</i>

1478

<i># To the valley below #</i>

1479
01:27:02,217 --> 01:27:03,548
Chester?

1480
01:27:05,921 --> 01:27:07,855
- Billy.
- Mr. McCarty.

1481
01:27:07,923 --> 01:27:10,517
Ma'am.

1482
01:27:10,592 --> 01:27:14,722
So what's with all this
doomsday hocus-pocus going on?

1483
01:27:14,796 --> 01:27:19,392
<i># One more cup of coffee for the road #</i>

1484
01:27:19,468 --> 01:27:22,767
<i># One more cup of coffee 'fore I go #</i>

1485
01:27:22,838 --> 01:27:25,170
You two taking a trip?

1486
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:27,970
<i># To the valley below #</i>

1487
01:27:30,512 --> 01:27:33,777
Seven simple rules for life in hiding.

1488
01:27:36,685 --> 01:27:38,676
One...

1489
01:27:38,754 --> 01:27:42,155
never trust a cop in a raincoat.

1490
01:27:42,224 --> 01:27:43,885
<i>Two...</i>

1491
01:27:43,959 --> 01:27:47,486
<i>beware of enthusiasm and of love.</i>

1492
01:27:47,562 --> 01:27:51,896
<i>Each is temporary and quick to sway.</i>

1493
01:27:51,967 --> 01:27:54,367
<i>Three...</i>

1494
01:27:54,436 --> 01:27:57,894
<i>when asked if you care
about the world's problems,</i>

1495
01:27:57,973 --> 01:28:01,636
<i>look deep into the eyes of he who asks.</i>

1496
01:28:01,710 --> 01:28:04,611
He will not ask you again.

1497
01:28:04,680 --> 01:28:06,375
Pack up the meat, sweet.

1498
01:28:06,448 --> 01:28:09,645
It's king for king
and queen for queen.

1499
01:28:09,718 --> 01:28:11,049
Afternoon, Mr. McCarty.

1500
01:28:11,119 --> 01:28:12,586
George, Delia.

1501
01:28:12,654 --> 01:28:13,985
<i>Number four and five...</i>

1502
01:28:14,056 --> 01:28:15,717
- Good afternoon, Billy.
- Howdy, Mr. B.

1503
01:28:15,791 --> 01:28:17,349
<i>- Good morning.
...never give your real name.</i>

1504
01:28:17,426 --> 01:28:19,951
Afternoon,
Mr. Gladstone, sir.

1505
01:28:20,028 --> 01:28:21,586
Hey. Hey, hey.

1506
01:28:21,663 --> 01:28:23,096
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

1507
01:28:23,165 --> 01:28:24,826
Hey!

1508
01:28:25,867 --> 01:28:27,732
Hey, you all right, son?

1509
01:28:27,803 --> 01:28:29,703
Please, dear man,
you gotta get me outta here.

1510
01:28:29,771 --> 01:28:30,897
This here's chicken town.

1511
01:28:30,972 --> 01:28:32,701
And if ever told to look at yourself...

1512
01:28:36,778 --> 01:28:38,575
<i>never look.</i>

1513
01:28:43,652 --> 01:28:47,349
<i>His singing voice, asthmatic and whiny,</i>

1514
01:28:47,422 --> 01:28:50,914
<i>makes his success
at first seem inconceivable,</i>

1515
01:28:50,992 --> 01:28:53,426
<i>but for so many
of his ardent admirers,</i>

1516
01:28:53,495 --> 01:28:55,520
<i>- Quinn's simple raggedness...
- Here we go.</i>

1517
01:28:55,597 --> 01:28:57,895
<i>... was always the sound of his truth.
Could you pass me that?</i>

1518
01:28:57,966 --> 01:29:00,730
<i>In it, they could conjure
all the hard knocks</i>

1519
01:29:00,802 --> 01:29:03,737
<i>his rough and tumble story implies,</i>

1520
01:29:03,805 --> 01:29:05,898
<i>all the honest struggles</i>

1521
01:29:05,974 --> 01:29:08,135

Jesus.

01:29:09,678 --> 01:29:11,737
<i>- On the other hand...
- This guy's an asshole.</i>

1524
01:29:11,813 --> 01:29:14,043
<i>If Quinn's recent foray
into electronic music</i>

1525
01:29:14,116 --> 01:29:17,677

<i>Six...</i>

the person standing in front of you
cannot understand.

1532
01:29:31,867 --> 01:29:35,826
<i>For, despite his unwashed, freewheelin'

<i>It will be misinterpreted.</i>

1544

01:30:59,654 --> 01:31:03,249
<i>And wherever you bite,
black scabs grow.</i>

1554
01:31:03,325 --> 01:31:08,558
<i># He lived with his wife
and five children #</i>

1555
01:31:08,630 --> 01:31:11,861
<i># And his cabin #</i>

1556
01:31:11,933 --> 01:31:14,834
<i># Broken #</i>

1557
01:31:14,903 --> 01:31:17,269
<i># Down #</i>

1558
01:31:17,339 --> 01:31:19,933
<i># Down #</i>

1559
01:31:20,008 --> 01:31:22,499
<i># Down #</i>

1560
01:31:22,577 --> 01:31:25,205
<i># Down #</i>

1561
01:31:25,280 --> 01:31:27,510
<i># Down #</i>

1562
01:31:32,254 --> 01:31:35,280
For that man
be delivered from revenge,

1563
01:31:35,357 --> 01:31:38,121
that for me is the highest hope.

1564
01:31:38,193 --> 01:31:41,128
<i>A rainbow after a storm.</i>

1565
01:31:47,536 --> 01:31:49,504
Girls, Molly...

1566
01:31:49,571 --> 01:31:52,131
I want you to take everything
up to your room, okay?

1567
01:31:52,207 --> 01:31:54,198
I'll be up in two minutes for your baths.

1568
01:31:54,276 --> 01:31:55,208
Yes?

1569
01:31:55,277 --> 01:31:57,211
You sound out of breath.

1570
01:31:58,313 --> 01:32:00,281
Oh, so you're back?

1571
01:32:00,348 --> 01:32:01,508
<i>Today.</i>

1572
01:32:01,583 --> 01:32:03,175
<i>How are the girls?</i>

1573
01:32:03,251 --> 01:32:04,650
They're great.

1574
01:32:04,719 --> 01:32:06,448
<i>Busy. Enjoying school.</i>

1575
01:32:06,521 --> 01:32:08,489
That's great.

1576
01:32:08,557 --> 01:32:10,047
And you?

1577
01:32:10,125 --> 01:32:12,252
<i>Fine. We're all fine.</i>

1578
01:32:12,327 --> 01:32:17,492
So, um, which night is boat night?

1579
01:32:19,234 --> 01:32:21,065
Saturday?

1580
01:32:22,671 --> 01:32:24,662
<i>- Hello?
- Uh, yeah.</i>

1581
01:32:24,739 --> 01:32:27,606
<i>Saturday, that's, um...</i>

1582
01:32:27,676 --> 01:32:29,974
day after tomorrow.

1583
01:32:30,045 --> 01:32:31,706
<i>Yep.</i>

1584
01:32:31,780 --> 01:32:32,747
That's fine.

1585
01:32:32,814 --> 01:32:35,806
Mommy, who are you talking to?

1586
01:32:35,884 --> 01:32:37,943
All right, so what time?

1587
01:32:38,019 --> 01:32:40,817
Uh, 11:00?

1588
01:32:40,889 --> 01:32:43,756
Fine.

1589
01:32:43,825 --> 01:32:45,656
Mommy, who are you talking to?

1590
01:32:45,727 --> 01:32:47,354
Molly, what did I tell you about pickup?

1591
01:32:47,429 --> 01:32:48,919
<i>- Upstairs...
- Or I can get 'em earlier, just...</i>

1592
01:32:48,997 --> 01:32:51,465
<i>No, no, no, it's fine, fine.</i>

1593
01:32:51,533 --> 01:32:53,933
<i>But please bring those boxes, okay?</i>

1594
01:32:54,002 --> 01:32:56,664
<i>- I've asked you, like...
- Wait, what boxes?</i>

1595
01:32:56,738 --> 01:32:59,798
The photos. My photos?

1596
01:32:59,874 --> 01:33:01,171
<i>- I've asked you, like...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

1597
01:33:01,242 --> 01:33:02,300
Fine. Fine, fine.

1598
01:33:02,377 --> 01:33:04,709
Molly!

1599
01:33:04,779 --> 01:33:05,768
Okay, I gotta go.

1600
01:33:05,847 --> 01:33:06,814
Uh, welcome back.

1601
01:33:06,881 --> 01:33:09,008
<i>Thanks...</i>

1602
01:33:19,194 --> 01:33:20,718
<i>That's right, my friends.</i>

1603
01:33:20,795 --> 01:33:23,355
<i>I am holding the only true account,</i>

1604
01:33:23,431 --> 01:33:26,491
<i>so buy it here, read it there.</i>

1605
01:33:26,568 --> 01:33:29,332
<i>Buy it here, read it there.</i>

1606
01:33:29,404 --> 01:33:31,804
Buy it here, read it there.

1607
01:33:31,873 --> 01:33:35,138
An epic tale of blunder and despair,

1608
01:33:35,210 --> 01:33:38,441
a withering saga
of mystery unveiled,

1609
01:33:38,513 --> 01:33:42,540
a swan song to America
before Chaplin set sail

1610
01:33:42,617 --> 01:33:45,518
or the children of dawn in crazy duress

1611
01:33:45,587 --> 01:33:49,387
ever watched the red sun
without bothering to dress.

1612
01:33:49,457 --> 01:33:51,925
Buy it here, read it there!

1613
01:33:51,993 --> 01:33:55,190
An epic tale of blunder and despair,

1614
01:33:55,263 --> 01:33:58,960
a withering saga of mystery unveiled,

1615
01:33:59,034 --> 01:34:03,061
a swan song to America
before Chaplin set sail

1616
01:34:03,138 --> 01:34:05,868
and the children of dawn
in crazy duress...

1617
01:34:06,941 --> 01:34:09,603
Thief! Somebody stop that man!

1618
01:34:09,678 --> 01:34:11,771
Stop!

1619
01:34:13,348 --> 01:34:15,816
No!

1620
01:34:30,565 --> 01:34:33,557
# I'm goin' down #

1621
01:34:33,635 --> 01:34:37,071
# To Rose Marie #

1622
01:34:37,138 --> 01:34:41,973
# She never does me wrong #

1623
01:34:43,511 --> 01:34:47,572
# She puts it to me #

1624
01:34:47,649 --> 01:34:50,846
# Plain as day #

1625
01:34:50,919 --> 01:34:55,754
# And gives it to me for a song #

1626
01:34:55,824 --> 01:34:59,851
# It's a wicked lie #

1627
01:34:59,928 --> 01:35:03,386
# But what the hell #

1628
01:35:03,465 --> 01:35:08,266
# Don't everybody got to eat? #

1629
01:35:09,804 --> 01:35:13,296
# And I'm just the same #

1630
01:35:13,374 --> 01:35:15,865
# As anyone else #

1631
01:35:15,944 --> 01:35:18,970
# When it comes to scratchin' #

1632
01:35:19,047 --> 01:35:21,413
# For my meat #

1633
01:35:23,318 --> 01:35:29,314
# Goin' to Acapulco #

1634
01:35:30,859 --> 01:35:35,193
# Goin' on the run #

1635
01:35:36,898 --> 01:35:38,957
# Goin' down #

1636
01:35:39,033 --> 01:35:43,697

1637
01:35:43,772 --> 01:35:47,868
# Gonna have some fun #

1638
01:35:49,644 --> 01:35:54,479
# It's not a bad way to make a livin' #

1639
01:35:55,850 --> 01:36:01,789
# And I ain't complainin' none #

1640
01:36:01,856 --> 01:36:05,417
# Well, I can blow my plum #

1641
01:36:05,493 --> 01:36:07,984
# And drink my rum #

1642
01:36:08,062 --> 01:36:10,360
# And then go on home #

1643
01:36:10,431 --> 01:36:13,628
# And have my fun #

1644
01:36:15,436 --> 01:36:21,432
# Goin' to Acapulco #

1648
01:36:40,395 --> 01:36:46,391
# Yeah #

1649
01:36:47,602 --> 01:36:51,732
# Gonna have some fun #

1650
01:36:54,609 --> 01:36:57,669
<i>Trouble was, I'd grown
partial to the place...</i>

1651
01:36:57,745 --> 01:37:00,839
<i>that sudden smell of fear</i>

1652
01:37:00,915 --> 01:37:02,542
<i>and the thrill of waiting up</i>

1653
01:37:02,617 --> 01:37:04,881
<i>for the end of the world.</i>

1654
01:37:18,466 --> 01:37:23,335
<i># I'm not your stepping stone #</i>

1655
01:37:25,473 --> 01:37:29,068
<i># You're trying to make
your mark in society #</i>

1656
01:37:29,143 --> 01:37:30,235
<i># You're losin' all the friends... #</i>

1657
01:37:30,311 --> 01:37:32,438
Congratulations, you're a millionaire.

1658
01:37:32,513 --> 01:37:34,413
- Huh?
- They agreed to everything.

1659
01:37:34,482 --> 01:37:36,916
- Full guarantees.
- How many dates?

1660
01:37:36,985 --> 01:37:39,385
There's 55 additional, I think it was.

1661
01:37:39,454 --> 01:37:40,853
Plus the 30?

1662
01:37:40,922 --> 01:37:42,913
Well, 29, minus tonight is 28.

1663
01:37:42,991 --> 01:37:44,253
That's 83 total.

1664
01:37:44,325 --> 01:37:45,849
83 shows?

1665
01:37:45,927 --> 01:37:46,985
Well, it's not really 83 shows...

1666
01:37:47,061 --> 01:37:50,292
Man, I can't do 83 more shows.

1667
01:37:50,365 --> 01:37:53,163
It's going to fucking kill me
doing 83 more shows.

1668
01:37:53,234 --> 01:37:55,794
Who the fuck said I ever
wanted to be a millionaire?

1669
01:37:55,870 --> 01:37:57,804
Jude!

1670
01:37:57,872 --> 01:37:58,804
Hey.

1671
01:37:58,873 --> 01:38:00,067
Far out show.

1672
01:38:00,141 --> 01:38:01,108
Thanks, man.

1673
01:38:01,175 --> 01:38:02,904
Grab a throne.

1674
01:38:02,977 --> 01:38:04,069
Really?

1675
01:38:04,145 --> 01:38:05,737
Far out.

1676
01:38:05,813 --> 01:38:09,408
You know Norman, my executioner.

1677
01:38:09,484 --> 01:38:15,252
Norman, this is Brian Jones
from that groovy covers band.

1678
01:38:15,323 --> 01:38:18,759
<i># Now you're walkin' round
like you're front page news #</i>

1679
01:38:18,826 --> 01:38:22,262
<i># You've been awful careful
'bout the friends you choose #</i>

1680
01:38:22,330 --> 01:38:25,493
<i># But you won't find my name
in your book of Who's Who #</i>

1681
01:38:25,566 --> 01:38:31,129
<i># I said I'm not your stepping stone #</i>

1682
01:38:31,205 --> 01:38:33,105
Find the drinks.

1683
01:38:34,609 --> 01:38:37,737
Look at all these medicines.

1684
01:38:37,812 --> 01:38:40,542
Hey, man, what... what are those?

1685
01:38:40,615 --> 01:38:41,980
Mandies.

1686
01:38:42,050 --> 01:38:43,108
They make you sleep.

1687
01:38:43,184 --> 01:38:46,620
Sleep! I ain't sleepin'.

1688
01:38:46,688 --> 01:38:48,280
Sleep's for dreamers.

1689
01:38:48,356 --> 01:38:51,189
I haven't slept in 30 days, man.

1690
01:38:51,259 --> 01:38:54,160
Takes a lot of medicine
to keep up this pace.

1691
01:38:58,199 --> 01:38:59,291
Coco!

1692
01:38:59,367 --> 01:39:02,495
Norman, darling.

1693
01:39:02,570 --> 01:39:04,561
I know I'm a wretch for being late.

1694
01:39:04,639 --> 01:39:08,473
And it was entirely my fault.

1695
01:39:08,543 --> 01:39:10,534
Hey, what's happening?

1696
01:39:11,980 --> 01:39:14,346
I feel like complete shit
is what's happening.

1697
01:39:14,415 --> 01:39:16,406
Well, you don't look it.

1698
01:39:22,690 --> 01:39:25,181
Aw, true love...

1699
01:39:25,259 --> 01:39:27,887
here in the land
of Charles Atlas and the bomb.

1700
01:39:27,962 --> 01:39:30,294
Oh, fuck off.

1701
01:39:30,365 --> 01:39:34,461
She's been kinda... uptight lately.

1702
01:39:34,535 --> 01:39:35,832
Oh, she has.

1703
01:39:35,903 --> 01:39:36,995
Oh, I see.

1704
01:39:37,071 --> 01:39:40,438
Yes, in fact, if you'd like to know,
it's been complete shit.

1705
01:39:40,508 --> 01:39:43,068
- Angelina's been missing for four days.
- Her cat.

1706
01:39:44,445 --> 01:39:46,675
Judey knows who Angelina is,
don't you, Judey?

1707
01:39:46,748 --> 01:39:50,844
If you're asking if I remember
your little pussy, of course I do.

1708
01:39:54,188 --> 01:39:55,655
Charming.

1709
01:39:55,723 --> 01:39:58,988
She has the sweetest little pussy.

1710
01:39:59,060 --> 01:40:00,084
If you don't count the teeth.

1711
01:40:00,161 --> 01:40:01,185
Okay, man.

1712
01:40:01,262 --> 01:40:03,730
Oh, but properly protected.

1713
01:40:06,167 --> 01:40:07,930
Meow!

1714
01:40:08,002 --> 01:40:09,799
- Baby!
- Don't call me that!

1715
01:40:09,871 --> 01:40:11,896
Slow down, slow down, slow down.

1716
01:40:11,973 --> 01:40:16,069
I tell you, love and sex are two things

1717
01:40:16,144 --> 01:40:19,079
that really hang people up.

1718
01:40:20,448 --> 01:40:23,315
Why that is...

1719
01:40:23,384 --> 01:40:26,410
I'Il... I'll never fully understand.

1720
01:40:29,390 --> 01:40:34,657
<i>Death to all those
who would whimper and cry.</i>

1721
01:40:34,729 --> 01:40:38,130
Did she... Do you think she...

1722
01:40:38,199 --> 01:40:39,826
Don't worry, man.

1723
01:40:39,901 --> 01:40:42,495
She'll be back.

1724
01:40:42,570 --> 01:40:45,664
Chick's gotta shit on something.

1725
01:40:45,740 --> 01:40:47,002
What do you mean?

1726
01:40:47,075 --> 01:40:49,908
What do I mean?

1727
01:40:49,977 --> 01:40:53,071
Who are you?

1728
01:40:53,147 --> 01:40:54,409
I mean...

1729
01:40:54,482 --> 01:40:58,816
who gave you permission
to even be here?

1730
01:41:01,956 --> 01:41:05,756
You're... You're like a shadow, man.

1731
01:41:05,827 --> 01:41:08,455
Maybe you were hip once,

1732
01:41:08,529 --> 01:41:10,827
but that trick got old, man,

1733
01:41:10,898 --> 01:41:12,923
a long time ago.

1734
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:14,900
Now, every time
you open your mouth,

1735
01:41:14,969 --> 01:41:19,030
it's like, how long is this gonna take?

1736
01:41:19,107 --> 01:41:22,634
It's not like anyone's
gonna tell you to your face.

1737
01:41:22,710 --> 01:41:24,575
No one wants to deal,
you know, with, like,

1738
01:41:24,645 --> 01:41:28,137
a pathetic situation.

1739
01:41:28,216 --> 01:41:29,740
Guess I'm the asshole, right?

1740
01:41:29,817 --> 01:41:33,446
Because I'm the only one
with any balls.

1741
01:41:40,561 --> 01:41:44,327
Oh, man, it's sad.

1742
01:41:46,067 --> 01:41:48,501
You used to be funny.

1743
01:41:48,569 --> 01:41:50,730
And you honestly think
that chick sees you

1744
01:41:50,805 --> 01:41:54,263
as anything but a... as a tool?

1745
01:41:59,447 --> 01:42:01,711
Oh, no, you're kidding me.

1746
01:42:01,782 --> 01:42:03,511
I can't even watch this.

1747
01:42:03,584 --> 01:42:05,279
<i>The sky isn't yellow.</i>

1748
01:42:05,353 --> 01:42:06,945
<i>It's chicken.</i>

1749
01:42:09,090 --> 01:42:12,719
You know, people said
you could be a real cocksucker.

1750
01:42:12,793 --> 01:42:16,559
Well, it's not what goes
into a man's mouth, babe,

1751
01:42:16,631 --> 01:42:17,563
that defiles it.

1752
01:42:17,632 --> 01:42:20,567
No, it's what comes out.

1753
01:42:20,635 --> 01:42:25,902
Good and evil were invented
by people trapped in scenes.

1754
01:42:29,410 --> 01:42:30,809
Uh!

1755
01:42:30,878 --> 01:42:32,004
Oh, damn it.

1756
01:42:32,079 --> 01:42:33,910
Come on, let's get him outta here.

1757
01:42:33,981 --> 01:42:36,211
Get that door!

1758
01:42:50,731 --> 01:42:54,724
<i># I'm beginning to hear voices #</i>

1759
01:42:54,802 --> 01:42:57,999
<i># And there's no one around #</i>

1760
01:42:58,072 --> 01:43:01,599
<i># Now I'm all used up #</i>

1761
01:43:01,676 --> 01:43:05,544
<i># And the fields have turned brown #</i>

1762
01:43:05,613 --> 01:43:07,979
<i># 20 miles out of town #</i>

1763
01:43:08,049 --> 01:43:10,847
<i># Cold irons bound #</i>

1764
01:43:31,305 --> 01:43:34,399
Son, you better get down
off of that thing.

1765
01:43:34,475 --> 01:43:37,239
You're liable to get yourself killed!

1766
01:43:38,913 --> 01:43:41,541
How does it feel?

1767
01:43:41,616 --> 01:43:43,675
<i># I got to know, Lord #</i>

1768
01:43:43,751 --> 01:43:46,743
<i># When to pull back on the reins #</i>

1769
01:43:46,821 --> 01:43:49,483
<i># Death can be the result of the most
underrated things #</i>

1770
01:43:49,557 --> 01:43:53,220
Man that is born of woman
is of few days...

1771
01:43:53,294 --> 01:43:55,660
<i>and full of trouble.</i>

1772
01:43:55,730 --> 01:43:57,322
Why don't you do your early stuff?

1773
01:43:57,398 --> 01:43:59,332
<i># Satan whispers to ya #</i>

1774
01:43:59,400 --> 01:44:01,960
<i># Well, I don't wanna bore ya #</i>

1775
01:44:02,036 --> 01:44:04,766
<i># But when you get tired
of that Miss So-and-So #</i>

1776
01:44:04,839 --> 01:44:06,397
<i># I got another woman for ya #</i>

1777
01:44:06,474 --> 01:44:08,908
<i>Why, when nations rage</i>

1778
01:44:08,976 --> 01:44:10,443
<i>and kingdoms totter,</i>

1779
01:44:10,511 --> 01:44:13,173
<i>when disaster follows hard upon disaster</i>

1780
01:44:13,247 --> 01:44:15,181
<i>and terror hangs on every side...</i>

1781
01:44:19,520 --> 01:44:22,421
Why hast Thou made me Thy mark?

1782
01:44:22,490 --> 01:44:25,550
<i># Trouble in mind, Lord #</i>

1783
01:44:25,626 --> 01:44:27,958
<i># Trouble in mind #</i>

1784
01:44:28,029 --> 01:44:31,556
<i># Lord, take away this trouble in mind #</i>

1785
01:44:31,632 --> 01:44:34,965
<i>It's hard not to go to hell.</i>

1786
01:44:35,036 --> 01:44:39,166
<i>There's so many distractions,
so many influences.</i>

1787
01:44:39,240 --> 01:44:41,606
<i>Start walking right,
and pretty soon,</i>

1788
01:44:41,676 --> 01:44:43,735
<i>there's someone
gonna drag you down.</i>

1789
01:44:43,811 --> 01:44:47,212
<i>Sure as we're living, sure as we're born,</i>

1790
01:44:47,281 --> 01:44:49,772
<i>look up, look up.</i>

1791
01:44:49,850 --> 01:44:53,377
<i>Gabriel blows his horn.</i>

1792
01:44:53,454 --> 01:44:55,649
He was having a lot of worries,

1793
01:44:55,723 --> 01:44:58,521
telling me things.

1794
01:44:58,592 --> 01:45:02,585
I just asked him one day,
I said, "Have you ever prayed?"

1795
01:45:02,663 --> 01:45:07,123
And he said, "Pray?"

1796
01:45:07,201 --> 01:45:09,692
You know, like that.

1797
01:45:09,770 --> 01:45:12,603
And he started asking
a lot of questions.

1798
01:45:12,673 --> 01:45:15,141
<i>I didn't know him then,</i>

1799
01:45:15,209 --> 01:45:18,042
<i>but I sure knew who he was.</i>

1800
01:45:18,112 --> 01:45:20,171
<i>People worshipped him.</i>

1801
01:45:20,247 --> 01:45:22,738
Maybe only Jesus
could've unburdened

1802
01:45:22,817 --> 01:45:26,685
someone like that
from such omnipotence.

1803
01:45:26,754 --> 01:45:29,279
In spring of 1974,

1804
01:45:29,357 --> 01:45:32,292
Jack Rollins followed
girlfriend Angela Reeves

1805
01:45:32,360 --> 01:45:34,089
to Stockton, California,

1806
01:45:34,161 --> 01:45:36,391
and enrolled in a course in Bible study

1807
01:45:36,464 --> 01:45:40,059
here at the California
Gateway Brotherhood Church,

1808
01:45:40,134 --> 01:45:43,365
a Pentecostal assembly
just outside Stockton.

1809
01:45:43,437 --> 01:45:44,904
Six months later,

1810
01:45:44,972 --> 01:45:48,169
Rollins accepted Jesus into his heart.

1811
01:45:48,242 --> 01:45:50,733
<i>Today, the one-time '60s folk hero</i>

1812
01:45:50,811 --> 01:45:53,439
<i>is a fully ordained member
of the Gateway Ministry</i>

1813
01:45:53,514 --> 01:45:56,745
<i>and an active figure in the state's
evangelical community.</i>

1814
01:45:56,817 --> 01:45:59,342
<i>And yet, for the past two decades,</i>

1815
01:45:59,420 --> 01:46:02,184
<i>Father John has remained
silent about his past.</i>

1816
01:46:02,256 --> 01:46:03,689
<i>I asked him why.</i>

1817
01:46:03,758 --> 01:46:08,092
Old things are passed away.

1818
01:46:08,162 --> 01:46:10,494
All things are made anew.

1819
01:46:10,564 --> 01:46:12,828
It doesn't matter what I did before.

1820
01:46:13,834 --> 01:46:16,632
I've never lied to you.

1821
01:46:16,704 --> 01:46:19,571
Never told you who to vote for
or to follow anybody,

1822
01:46:19,640 --> 01:46:22,803
back then when
I was selling my records.

1823
01:46:22,877 --> 01:46:24,435
What I didn't know
is that it didn't matter

1824
01:46:24,512 --> 01:46:27,276
what kind of music you were playing.

1825
01:46:27,348 --> 01:46:32,684
Folk, pop, rock 'n roll...

1826
01:46:32,753 --> 01:46:34,687
we're all rolled up
in the devil's pocket.

1827
01:46:34,755 --> 01:46:40,853
Now, I'm not talking about a devil
with the pitchfork and horns.

1828
01:46:40,928 --> 01:46:46,730
I'm talking about a spiritual devil
in the midnight hour.

1829
01:46:46,801 --> 01:46:50,168
He's gotta be overcome.

1830
01:46:50,237 --> 01:46:55,504
And we here in America,
we shall overcome.

1831
01:46:55,576 --> 01:46:59,376
What greater honor for a nation

1832
01:46:59,447 --> 01:47:01,938
than to speak for God?

1833
01:47:02,082 --> 01:47:04,243
For some say that the war
to end all wars

1834
01:47:04,318 --> 01:47:06,616
has already begun
right now in the Middle East,

1835
01:47:06,687 --> 01:47:10,453
where it is prophesized
that the weak will fall.

1836
01:47:12,860 --> 01:47:15,886
And that Jesus will set up
His kingdom in Jerusalem.

1837
01:47:15,963 --> 01:47:19,865
So why should we worry
when we're already free,

1838
01:47:19,934 --> 01:47:21,299
right here, right now?

1839
01:47:21,368 --> 01:47:22,596
And why are you free?

1840
01:47:22,670 --> 01:47:24,467
You're free because Jesus
paid for you to be.

1841
01:47:24,538 --> 01:47:25,971
That's why you're free.

1842
01:47:26,040 --> 01:47:30,443
You're free to seek
the higher calling of the Lord.

1843
01:47:32,012 --> 01:47:36,176
Now pick up your bed and walk.

01:51:45,866 --> 01:51:47,766
Perhaps I even would.

1902
01:51:47,835 --> 01:51:50,099
If you actually could, who knows?

1903
01:51:53,073 --> 01:51:56,338
But I'm not going to take your children
away from you, Robbie,

1904
01:51:56,410 --> 01:52:00,369
so you don't have to...
to try and threaten me.

1905
01:52:12,392 --> 01:52:14,952
<i># Someone's got it in for me #</i>

1906
01:52:15,028 --> 01:52:19,021
<i># They're planting
stories in the press #</i>

1907
01:52:20,834 --> 01:52:23,803
<i># Whoever it is,
I wish they'd cut it out #</i>

1908
01:52:23,871 --> 01:52:27,238
<i># But when they will, I can only guess #</i>

1909
01:52:29,209 --> 01:52:32,337
<i># They say I shot
a man named Gray #</i>

1910
01:52:32,412 --> 01:52:35,745
<i># And took his wife to Italy #</i>

1911
01:52:35,816 --> 01:52:38,216
<i># She inherited a million bucks #</i>

1912
01:52:38,285 --> 01:52:40,879
<i># And when she died,
it came to me #</i>

1913
01:52:40,954 --> 01:52:44,720
<i># I can't help it if I'm lucky #</i>

1914
01:52:46,593 --> 01:52:48,618
<i># People see me all the time #</i>

1915
01:52:48,695 --> 01:52:53,291
<i># And they just can't
remember how to act #</i>

1916
01:52:55,335 --> 01:52:57,963
<i># Their minds are filled with big ideas #</i>

1917
01:52:58,038 --> 01:52:59,505
<i># Images #</i>

1918
01:52:59,573 --> 01:53:02,337
<i># And distorted facts #</i>

1919
01:53:04,344 --> 01:53:06,710
<i># Even you, yesterday #</i>

1920
01:53:06,780 --> 01:53:09,840
<i># You had to ask me where it was at #</i>

1921
01:53:09,917 --> 01:53:13,011
<i># I couldn't believe
after all these years #</i>

1922
01:53:13,086 --> 01:53:16,681
<i># You didn't know me
any better than that #</i>

1923
01:53:16,757 --> 01:53:19,487
<i># Sweet lady #</i>

1924
01:53:20,894 --> 01:53:23,692
<i># Idiot wind #</i>

1925
01:53:23,764 --> 01:53:27,928
<i># Blowing every time
you move your mouth #</i>

1926
01:53:30,070 --> 01:53:34,166
<i># Going down the back roads,
headin' south #</i>

1927
01:53:35,943 --> 01:53:38,935
<i># Idiot wind #</i>

1928
01:53:39,012 --> 01:53:43,210
<i># Blowing every time
you move your teeth #</i>

1929
01:53:44,218 --> 01:53:46,948
<i># You're an idiot, babe #</i>

1930
01:53:47,020 --> 01:53:52,959
<i># It's a wonder that you
still know how to breathe #</i>

1931
01:54:01,835 --> 01:54:04,395
<i># It was gravity which pulled us in #</i>

1932
01:54:04,471 --> 01:54:09,704
<i># And destiny
which broke us apart #</i>

1933
01:54:09,776 --> 01:54:12,540
<i># You tamed the lion in my cage #</i>

1934
01:54:12,613 --> 01:54:17,380
<i># But it just wasn't enough
to change my heart #</i>

1935
01:54:17,451 --> 01:54:20,318
<i># Now everything's a little upside-down #</i>

1936
01:54:20,387 --> 01:54:23,049
<i># As a matter of fact,
the wheels have stopped #</i>

1937
01:54:23,123 --> 01:54:25,819
<i># What's good is bad,
what's bad is good #</i>

1938
01:54:25,893 --> 01:54:28,885
<i># You find out
when you reach the top #</i>

1939
01:54:28,962 --> 01:54:32,090
<i># You're on the bottom #</i>

1940
01:54:54,922 --> 01:54:57,857
<i>Some people have a deep...</i>

1941
01:54:57,925 --> 01:55:01,292
<i>...and try and shake this flytrap.</i>

1942
01:55:01,361 --> 01:55:03,329
<i>But they took away
the meaning, Alice,</i>

1943
01:55:03,397 --> 01:55:05,865
<i>and I was a pawn in their game.</i>

1944
01:55:05,933 --> 01:55:08,925
<i>I'm telling you, if I don't
bust out of here quick,</i>

1945
01:55:09,002 --> 01:55:10,663
<i>try and dope things out...</i>

1946
01:55:14,241 --> 01:55:16,937
<i>so long, Alice.</i>

1947
01:55:17,010 --> 01:55:18,841
<i>Jack, where are you gonna go?</i>

1948
01:55:20,948 --> 01:55:23,508
<i>First place that
doesn't know my name.</i>

1949
01:55:30,657 --> 01:55:32,921
So, good people of Riddle,

1950
01:55:32,993 --> 01:55:36,326
we come here with no intent to disrupt,

1951
01:55:36,396 --> 01:55:39,695
but only to commend you
for your patient courage

1952
01:55:39,766 --> 01:55:41,700
in this time of change.

1953
01:55:41,768 --> 01:55:44,737
And in addition,
we are pleased to announce

1954
01:55:44,805 --> 01:55:48,172
the evacuation fund has been established
by the state of Missouri

1955
01:55:48,241 --> 01:55:49,868
as I pledged to you it would be.

1956
01:55:53,613 --> 01:55:57,105
Exactly what does that do
for the common folk like myself?

1957
01:55:57,184 --> 01:55:58,947
Dollar compensation

1958
01:55:59,019 --> 01:56:02,511
will be made available to, uh, uh...

1959
01:56:02,589 --> 01:56:04,454
Eligible evacuees.

1960
01:56:04,524 --> 01:56:06,287
So what you want to do
is throw some pennies

1961
01:56:06,360 --> 01:56:07,850
after you done took our lives!

1962
01:56:08,929 --> 01:56:10,863
I assure you, boy,

1963
01:56:10,931 --> 01:56:13,365
nobody here in the business
of taking lives.

1964
01:56:13,433 --> 01:56:17,529
Might wanna explain that
to Ms. Henry up there.

1965
01:56:17,604 --> 01:56:20,198
Yeah, or Ms. Montgomery.

1966
01:56:20,273 --> 01:56:22,537
Or how about Old Man Sykes?

1967
01:56:22,609 --> 01:56:23,940
Yeah, well, the way I see it,

1968
01:56:24,011 --> 01:56:26,445
you can either go through Riddle,
or you can go around them,

1969
01:56:26,513 --> 01:56:27,912
so why are you going
through our town?

1970
01:56:27,981 --> 01:56:30,040
Yeah, that's right,
that's right, he said it.

1971
01:56:30,117 --> 01:56:31,675
Who is that talking?

1972
01:56:31,752 --> 01:56:34,016
You there.

1973
01:56:34,087 --> 01:56:35,884
- What's your name?
- My name?

1974
01:56:35,956 --> 01:56:38,720
- Mm.
- William.

1975
01:56:38,792 --> 01:56:41,260
William, did you say?
Show your face.

1976
01:56:43,096 --> 01:56:44,757
Yes, sir.

1977
01:56:46,433 --> 01:56:49,095
I had... I had a friend...

1978
01:56:51,471 --> 01:56:53,871
However, thing is, sir, truly,

1979
01:56:53,940 --> 01:56:56,909
you got us hanging by a thread here.

1980
01:56:56,977 --> 01:56:59,707
Who are you? I know you.

1981
01:56:59,780 --> 01:57:02,180
I don't reckon so.

1982
01:57:02,249 --> 01:57:04,046
You ever live in Dallas County?

1983
01:57:04,117 --> 01:57:06,608
- Can't say I have.
- New Mexico?

1984
01:57:06,686 --> 01:57:08,244
No!

1985
01:57:08,321 --> 01:57:12,087
You were talented.
Boy, you could shoot.

1986
01:57:12,159 --> 01:57:14,719
You could sing a ditty
like nobody I ever seen.

1987
01:57:14,795 --> 01:57:17,195
You got... You got any musical strain?

1988
01:57:18,999 --> 01:57:21,263
I never had the knack.

1989
01:57:21,334 --> 01:57:24,633
What we're saying
is that you and your boys,

1990
01:57:24,704 --> 01:57:25,932
you go do as you please,

1991
01:57:26,006 --> 01:57:28,531
just so long as you stay clear
of Riddle County.

1992
01:57:31,711 --> 01:57:33,702
Do you think you're speaking
for the people, sir?

1993
01:57:33,780 --> 01:57:36,772
You are just stirring up lies
and getting folks agitated.

1994
01:57:36,850 --> 01:57:37,942
Now, we have methods

1995
01:57:38,018 --> 01:57:40,077
for dealing with
scoundrels like yourself.

1996
01:57:49,963 --> 01:57:51,590
Boys, bring him in!

1997
01:57:51,665 --> 01:57:53,758
Hey, hey, what do you
think you're doing?

1998
01:57:56,103 --> 01:57:57,468
Quiet down!

1999
01:57:57,537 --> 01:58:00,506
No need to get off to cause
another insurgence...

2000
01:58:02,008 --> 01:58:04,169
Take care of my horse!
Take care of my horse!

2001
01:58:13,653 --> 01:58:15,678
<i>Takes a thief to catch a thief.</i>

2002
01:58:15,755 --> 01:58:17,382
<i># She cried both day and night #</i>

2003
01:58:17,457 --> 01:58:22,326
<i># I know it because it was there #</i>

2004
01:58:24,364 --> 01:58:27,424
<i># It's a milestone #</i>

2005
01:58:27,501 --> 01:58:30,436
<i># But she's down on her luck #</i>

2006
01:58:30,504 --> 01:58:34,065
<i># And she mainly so lonely #</i>

2007
01:58:34,141 --> 01:58:37,406
<i># But to make him hard to buck #</i>

2008
01:58:37,477 --> 01:58:40,037
<i># I was there #</i>

2009
01:58:42,582 --> 01:58:44,516
<i>I know I have a sickness...</i>

2010
01:58:44,584 --> 01:58:47,314
<i>festering somewhere.</i>

2011
01:58:47,387 --> 01:58:48,979
<i>I don't mean like Woody Guthrie,</i>

2012
01:58:49,055 --> 01:58:50,716
<i>wasting away in some hospital.</i>

2013
01:58:50,790 --> 01:58:53,418
His vitals are stable.

2014
01:58:53,493 --> 01:58:55,120
What he needs is sleep.

2015
01:58:55,195 --> 01:58:56,594
<i>I couldn't do that.</i>

2016
01:58:56,663 --> 01:58:58,563
<i>Decay like that.</i>

2017
01:58:58,632 --> 01:59:02,193
That's nature's will,
and I'm against nature.

2018
01:59:03,770 --> 01:59:06,568
I don't dig nature at all.

2019
01:59:06,640 --> 01:59:09,734
I don't think he can get back on stage.

2020
01:59:09,809 --> 01:59:12,539
He's gotten inside so many psyches,

2021
01:59:12,612 --> 01:59:16,708
and death is just such a part
of the American scene right now.

2022
01:59:16,783 --> 01:59:19,217
It's the reds that make him mean.

2023
01:59:19,286 --> 01:59:22,187
He's already gone.

2024
01:59:22,255 --> 01:59:26,419
<i>The only truly natural things are dreams,</i>

2025
01:59:26,493 --> 01:59:29,326
<i>which nature cannot
touch with decay.</i>

2026
01:59:29,396 --> 01:59:32,490
<i># When I'm there, she's all right #</i>

2027
01:59:32,566 --> 01:59:36,002
<i># But she's not when I'm gone #</i>

2028
01:59:38,572 --> 01:59:42,099
<i># Heaven knows that the answer #</i>

2029
01:59:42,175 --> 01:59:45,372
<i># She don't call no one #</i>

2030
01:59:45,445 --> 01:59:46,707
<i># She's the way #</i>

2031
01:59:46,780 --> 01:59:48,680
<i># For sailing beautiful #</i>

2032
01:59:48,748 --> 01:59:51,649
<i># She's mine for the one #</i>

2033
01:59:51,718 --> 01:59:54,983
<i># And I lost a heavy tension #</i>

2034
01:59:55,055 --> 01:59:58,081
<i># By temptation as it runs #</i>

2035
01:59:58,158 --> 02:00:00,649
<i># But she don't follow me #</i>

2036
02:00:00,727 --> 02:00:02,695
<i># But I'm not there #</i>

2037
02:00:02,762 --> 02:00:04,491
<i># I'm gone #</i>

2038
02:00:10,604 --> 02:00:13,869
<i># Now I'll cry tonight #</i>

2039
02:00:13,940 --> 02:00:16,568
<i># Like I cried the night before #</i>

2040
02:00:16,643 --> 02:00:20,044
<i># And I'll feast on the highs #</i>

2041
02:00:20,113 --> 02:00:23,276
<i># But I'll dream about the door #</i>

2042
02:00:23,350 --> 02:00:26,342
<i># So long, Jesus, savior #</i>

2043
02:00:26,419 --> 02:00:27,613
<i># Blind faith #</i>

2044
02:00:27,687 --> 02:00:29,484
<i># Is the tale #</i>

2045
02:00:29,556 --> 02:00:32,719
<i># It don't have confirmation #</i>

2046
02:00:32,792 --> 02:00:36,387
<i># She smiles fairly well #</i>

2047
02:00:38,798 --> 02:00:42,097
<i># Now, when I choose to live it #</i>

2048
02:00:42,168 --> 02:00:45,160
<i># I was born to love her #</i>

2049
02:00:45,238 --> 02:00:47,399
<i># But she knows that #</i>

2050
02:00:47,474 --> 02:00:48,736
<i># The kingdom waits #</i>

2051
02:00:48,808 --> 02:00:51,641
<i># So high above her #</i>

2052
02:00:51,711 --> 02:00:53,144
<i># And I run #</i>

2053
02:00:53,213 --> 02:00:54,805
<i># Then I race #</i>

2054
02:00:54,881 --> 02:00:58,248
<i># But it's not too fast to stand #</i>

2055
02:00:58,318 --> 02:00:59,910
<i># But I don't perceive her #</i>

2056
02:00:59,986 --> 02:01:01,010
<i># I'm not there #</i>

2057
02:01:01,087 --> 02:01:02,247
Don't worry, Mr. B.

2058
02:01:02,322 --> 02:01:05,052
Your secret's safe with me.

2059
02:01:05,125 --> 02:01:07,457
God save the secrets.

2060
02:01:10,730 --> 02:01:11,856
And you too, Homer.

2061
02:01:11,931 --> 02:01:14,058
Come on.

2062
02:01:16,836 --> 02:01:20,203
<i># I don't need anybody now #</i>

2063
02:01:20,273 --> 02:01:22,969
<i># Beside me to tell #</i>

2064
02:01:23,043 --> 02:01:26,103
<i># And it's all revelation #</i>

2065
02:01:26,179 --> 02:01:27,669
<i># I recede #</i>

2066
02:01:27,747 --> 02:01:28,907
<i># Good night #</i>

2067
02:01:28,982 --> 02:01:32,145
<i># She's a long-bodied beauty #</i>

2068
02:01:32,218 --> 02:01:35,449
<i># But she's gone like a smile #</i>

2069
02:01:35,522 --> 02:01:37,490
<i># And she's gone #</i>

2070
02:01:41,394 --> 02:01:45,091
<i># Yeah, she's gone like the rainbow #</i>

2071
02:01:45,165 --> 02:01:48,066
<i># That was shinin' yesterday #</i>

2072
02:01:48,134 --> 02:01:51,160
<i># But now she's old beside me #</i>

2073
02:01:51,237 --> 02:01:52,864
<i># And I'd like to hear... #</i>

2074
02:01:52,939 --> 02:01:54,702
Henry!

2075
02:01:54,774 --> 02:01:56,708
Henry!

2076
02:01:56,776 --> 02:01:58,038
Come on, Henry. Come on, girl.

2077
02:01:58,111 --> 02:01:59,043
Come on.

2078
02:01:59,112 --> 02:02:00,739
Come on!

2079
02:02:00,814 --> 02:02:02,441
Henry!

2080
02:02:02,515 --> 02:02:04,380
Come on!

2081
02:02:06,052 --> 02:02:08,577
Bye, Henry!

2082
02:02:14,294 --> 02:02:16,455
Good-bye, my lady.

2083
02:02:49,796 --> 02:02:54,256
<i># With your mercury mouth #</i>

2084
02:02:54,334 --> 02:02:58,634
<i># In the missionary times #</i>

2085
02:02:58,705 --> 02:03:02,607
<i># And your eyes like smoke #</i>

2086
02:03:02,675 --> 02:03:07,374
<i># And your prayers like rhymes #</i>

2087
02:03:07,447 --> 02:03:10,974
<i># And your silver cross #</i>

2088
02:03:11,050 --> 02:03:16,044
<i># And your voice
like chimes #</i>

2089
02:03:16,122 --> 02:03:17,749
Doesn't really matter, you know,

2090
02:03:17,824 --> 02:03:22,557
what kind of nasty names
people invent for the music.

2091
02:03:22,629 --> 02:03:26,429
But, uh, folk music
is just a word, you know,

2092
02:03:26,499 --> 02:03:30,196
that I can't use anymore.

2093
02:03:30,270 --> 02:03:33,364
What I'm talking about
is traditional music,

2094
02:03:33,440 --> 02:03:35,908
right, which is to say
it's mathematical music,

2095
02:03:35,975 --> 02:03:38,637
it's based on hexagons.

2096
02:03:38,711 --> 02:03:42,408
But all these songs
about, you know,

2097
02:03:42,482 --> 02:03:44,575
roses growing
out of people's brains

2098
02:03:44,651 --> 02:03:46,744
and lovers who are
really geese and swans

2099
02:03:46,820 --> 02:03:48,378
are turning into angels...

2100
02:03:48,455 --> 02:03:51,083
I mean, you know,
they're not going to die.

2101
02:03:51,157 --> 02:03:52,954
They're not folk music songs.

2102
02:03:53,026 --> 02:03:55,859
They're political songs.

2103
02:03:55,929 --> 02:03:57,692
They're already dead.

2104
02:03:58,965 --> 02:04:02,867
You'd think that these traditional music people

2105
02:04:02,936 --> 02:04:06,064
would... would gather
that mystery, you know,

2106
02:04:06,139 --> 02:04:08,073
is a traditional fact, you know,

2107
02:04:08,141 --> 02:04:10,769
seeing as they're
all so full of mystery.

2108
02:04:10,844 --> 02:04:12,311
And contradictions.

2109
02:04:12,378 --> 02:04:14,608
Yeah, contradictions.

2110
02:04:14,681 --> 02:04:17,206
And chaos.

2111
02:04:17,283 --> 02:04:20,047
Yes, it's chaos, clocks,
and watermelons...

2112
02:04:20,119 --> 02:04:21,643
You know, it's... it's everything.

2113
02:04:27,660 --> 02:04:30,493
These people actually think
I have some kind of, uh...

2114
02:04:32,465 --> 02:04:36,424
fantastic imagination.

2115
02:04:36,503 --> 02:04:38,403
It gets very, uh, lonesome.

2116
02:04:40,707 --> 02:04:42,834
But traditional music

2117
02:04:42,909 --> 02:04:44,399
is just, uh...

2118
02:04:44,477 --> 02:04:46,172
It's too unreal to die.

2119
02:04:46,246 --> 02:04:48,737
It doesn't need to be protected.

2120
02:04:48,815 --> 02:04:50,646
You know, I mean,
in that music is the only

2121
02:04:50,717 --> 02:04:52,548
true valid death
you can feel today,

2122
02:04:52,619 --> 02:04:56,077
you know, off a record player.

2123
02:04:56,155 --> 02:04:59,556
But like everything else in great demand,
people try to own it.

2124
02:05:03,963 --> 02:05:07,524
Has to do with, like,
uh, the purity thing.

2125
02:05:09,569 --> 02:05:12,060
I think its meaninglessness is holy.

2126
02:05:14,941 --> 02:05:17,535
Everybody knows I'm not a folk singer.

2127
02:06:08,428 --> 02:06:10,919
<i>People are always talking about freedom.</i>

2128
02:06:10,997 --> 02:06:13,761
<i>Freedom to live a certain way</i>

2129
02:06:13,833 --> 02:06:15,926
<i>without being kicked around.</i>

2130
02:06:22,175 --> 02:06:25,076
<i>Course, the more
you live a certain way,</i>

2131
02:06:25,144 --> 02:06:26,839
<i>the less it feels like freedom.</i>

2132
02:06:34,187 --> 02:06:37,782
<i>Me? I can change during
the course of a day.</i>

2133
02:06:37,857 --> 02:06:39,950
<i>I wake and I'm one person,</i>

2134
02:06:40,026 --> 02:06:41,789
<i>and when I go to sleep, I know for certain</i>

2135
02:06:41,861 --> 02:06:44,557
<i>I'm somebody else.</i>

2136
02:06:44,631 --> 02:06:46,690
<i>I don't know who I am,
most of the time.</i>

2137
02:07:01,180 --> 02:07:03,740
<i>It's like you got yesterday,</i>

2138
02:07:03,816 --> 02:07:07,115
<i>today, and tomorrow,
all in the same room.</i>

2139
02:07:12,191 --> 02:07:14,557
<i>There's no tellin' what can happen.</i>

2140
02:08:49,856 --> 02:08:52,290
<i># Once upon a time,
you dressed so fine #</i>

2141
02:08:52,358 --> 02:08:54,553
<i># Threw the bums a dime
in your prime #</i>

2142
02:08:55,995 --> 02:08:58,088
<i># Didn't you? #</i>

2143
02:09:00,032 --> 02:09:02,000
<i># People call, say beware, doll #</i>

2144
02:09:02,068 --> 02:09:04,536
<i># You're bound to fall
You thought they were all #</i>

2145
02:09:05,738 --> 02:09:08,002
<i># Kiddin' you #</i>

2146
02:09:10,676 --> 02:09:14,168
<i># You used to laugh about #</i>

2147
02:09:15,748 --> 02:09:19,946
<i># Everybody that was hangin' out #</i>

2148
02:09:20,019 --> 02:09:23,386
<i># Now you don't talk so loud #</i>

2149
02:09:24,924 --> 02:09:29,258
<i># Now you don't seem so proud #</i>

2150
02:09:29,328 --> 02:09:32,991
<i># About havin' to be scrounging #</i>

2151
02:09:33,065 --> 02:09:38,059
<i># Your next meal #</i>

2152
02:09:38,137 --> 02:09:40,196
<i># How does it feel? #</i>

2153
02:09:43,242 --> 02:09:44,971
<i># How does it feel #</i>

2154
02:09:47,747 --> 02:09:50,045
<i># To be without a home #</i>

2155
02:09:52,819 --> 02:09:55,549
<i># Like a complete unknown #</i>

2156
02:09:57,590 --> 02:10:00,115
<i># Like a rolling stone? #</i>

2157
02:10:20,813 --> 02:10:23,577
<i># Things are crashing better #</i>

2158
02:10:23,649 --> 02:10:27,210
<i># She's all too tight #</i>

2159
02:10:27,286 --> 02:10:29,083
<i># In my neighborhood #</i>

2160
02:10:29,155 --> 02:10:32,522
<i># She cried both day and night #</i>

2161
02:10:32,592 --> 02:10:35,789
<i># She's a lone-hearted mystic #</i>

2162
02:10:35,862 --> 02:10:38,854
<i># And she can't carry on #</i>

2163
02:10:38,931 --> 02:10:42,094
<i># When I'm there, she's all right #</i>

2164
02:10:42,168 --> 02:10:45,433
<i># Then she's not when I'm gone #</i>

2165
02:10:48,341 --> 02:10:51,435
<i># Heaven knows that the answer #</i>

2166
02:10:51,510 --> 02:10:54,604
<i># She don't call no one #</i>

2167
02:10:54,680 --> 02:10:57,615
<i># She's the way forsaken beauty #</i>

2168
02:10:57,683 --> 02:11:00,880
<i># She's mine for the one #</i>

2169
02:11:00,953 --> 02:11:04,047
<i># And I've asked her hesitating #</i>

2170
02:11:04,123 --> 02:11:06,853
<i># About temptation as it runs #</i>

2171
02:11:06,926 --> 02:11:10,225
<i># She don't follow me #</i>

2172
02:11:10,296 --> 02:11:11,957
<i># I'm leaving #</i>

2173
02:11:12,031 --> 02:11:13,328
<i># I'm gone #</i>

2174
02:11:16,469 --> 02:11:19,404
<i># Now, I'll cry tonight #</i>

2175
02:11:19,472 --> 02:11:22,771
<i># Like I cried the night before #</i>

2176
02:11:22,842 --> 02:11:25,777
<i># And I'll feast on the highway #</i>

2177
02:11:25,845 --> 02:11:28,905
<i># But I'll dream about the door #</i>

2178
02:11:28,981 --> 02:11:30,278
<i># It's alone #</i>

2179
02:11:30,349 --> 02:11:32,078
<i># She's forsaken #</i>

2180
02:11:32,151 --> 02:11:33,448
<i># By her fate #</i>

2181
02:11:33,519 --> 02:11:35,146
<i># Words to tell #</i>

2182
02:11:35,221 --> 02:11:38,213
<i># It don't have approximation #</i>

2183
02:11:38,291 --> 02:11:41,920
<i># She smiles fairly well #</i>

2184
02:11:44,864 --> 02:11:47,594
<i># Her smile is contagious #</i>

2185
02:11:47,667 --> 02:11:50,636
<i># I was born to love her #</i>

2186
02:11:50,703 --> 02:11:53,672
<i># But she knows that the kingdom #</i>

2187
02:11:53,739 --> 02:11:56,867
<i># Waits so high above her #</i>

2188
02:11:56,943 --> 02:11:58,240
<i># And I run #</i>

2189
02:11:58,311 --> 02:11:59,869
<i># But I race #</i>

2190
02:11:59,946 --> 02:12:02,938
<i># But it's not too fast to stand #</i>

2191
02:12:03,015 --> 02:12:06,041
<i># But I've got to be free #</i>

2192
02:12:06,118 --> 02:12:08,052
<i># And I'm not there #</i>

2193
02:12:08,120 --> 02:12:09,917
<i># I'm gone #</i>

2194
02:12:12,191 --> 02:12:15,627
<i># Well, it's too hard to stay here #</i>

2195
02:12:15,695 --> 02:12:18,186
<i># And I don't want to leave #</i>

2196
02:12:18,264 --> 02:12:21,290
<i># It's so hard for so few #</i>

2197
02:12:21,367 --> 02:12:22,493
<i># Sleep, but she's hard #</i>

2198
02:12:22,568 --> 02:12:24,627
<i># Too hard to breathe #</i>

2199
02:12:24,704 --> 02:12:25,966
<i># It's a load #</i>

2200
02:12:26,038 --> 02:12:27,437
<i># It's a crime #</i>

2201
02:12:27,506 --> 02:12:30,498
<i># The way she mauls me around #</i>

2202
02:12:30,576 --> 02:12:33,568
<i># But she don't phone to hate me #</i>

2203
02:12:33,646 --> 02:12:36,809
<i># But it's time to make the clown #</i>

2204
02:12:39,585 --> 02:12:42,748
<i># Yes, I believe that it's rightful #</i>

2205
02:12:42,822 --> 02:12:45,882
<i># I believe it in my mind #</i>

2206
02:12:45,958 --> 02:12:47,323
<i># I been told #</i>

2207
02:12:47,393 --> 02:12:48,655
<i># Like I slept #</i>

2208
02:12:48,728 --> 02:12:51,959
<i># Before I carry on the grind #</i>

2209
02:12:52,031 --> 02:12:54,829
<i># Yes, the soul judge had told her #</i>

2210
02:12:54,900 --> 02:12:58,802
<i># That I should carry on #</i>

2211
02:12:58,871 --> 02:13:03,205
<i># The child's been hurt and alone #</i>

2212
02:13:03,275 --> 02:13:05,800
<i># Then I'm gone #</i>

2213
02:13:11,650 --> 02:13:15,177
<i># Mama, take this badge off of me #</i>

2214
02:13:19,658 --> 02:13:22,650
<i># I can't use it anymore #</i>

2215
02:13:27,433 --> 02:13:28,923
<i># It's gettin' dark #</i>

2216
02:13:29,001 --> 02:13:31,367
<i># Much too dark to see #</i>

2217
02:13:35,174 --> 02:13:38,905
<i># Feel I'm knocking on heaven's door #</i>

2218
