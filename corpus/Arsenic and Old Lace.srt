1
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,612
I'll knock your block off, you big stiff!
You're a bum!

2
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,979
Strike! You're out!

3
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:09,889
Elmer, here it is.

4
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,492
- I knew you'd find it.
- Boy, I could sure use a drink.

5
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:18,294
I wonder if any big shots
are getting married today?

6
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:23,618
Looks like the same suckers
get married every day.

7
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:24,769
Come on.

8
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:27,210
Hey, the guy with the cheaters.

9
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,938
Now what's he hiding from?

10
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:43,773
- Hey, isn't that Mortimer Brewster?
- Mortimer Brewster, the dramatic critic?

11
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:48,534
No, it's not him. But what a scoop it'd be!

12
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:53,051
The guy who wrote The Bachelor's Bible
getting hooked. It's too good to be true.

13
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:55,495
Let's snap the mayor
in his new fire helmet and go.

14
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,536
Let's stick around, see who the guy is.

15
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:00,180
"Two by two they come and go"

16
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,531
Good morning, children.
Your name, please?

17
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,531
- Elaine Harper.
- Speak a little louder.

18
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:05,814
Elaine Harper.

19
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,733
Thank you. Yours?

20
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,416
- Mortimer Brewster.
- How's that?

21
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,419
Mortimer Brewster.

22
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,253
Speak up, sonny.
There's nothing to be afraid of.

23
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:26,298
I want to keep this undercover.

24
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:29,577
Love her? Of course you love her.
You're marrying her, right?

25
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,412
You don't understand. Come here.

26
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,536
I don't want this to get out for a while.

27
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,338
I'm Mortimer Brewster.

28
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:36,975
You're who?

29
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,454
Mortimer Brew...

30
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,415
That's him!

31
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:45,854
Mr. Brewster!

32
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:54,973
Now, look...

33
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,088
Goodbye, dear.

34
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,977
Don't you understand?
How can I marry you?

35
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:07,251
Me, the symbol of bachelorhood.
I've sneered at every love scene.

36
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,890
I've written four million words
against marriage!

37
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:14,019
Not only hooked, but to a minister's
daughter, and a girl from Brooklyn.

38
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:17,376
Look at the way you look!
What is that contraption you've got there?

39
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:21,375
A pin I borrowed from your aunts.
You know, "Something borrowed... "

40
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:24,293
I know, "Something borrowed,
something blue". Old, new.

41
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:26,814
Rice and old shoes.
Carry you over the threshold.

42
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,892
Niagara Falls. All that silly tripe.
Is this what I've come to?

43
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:32,699
I can't go through with it.
I won't marry you. That's that.

44
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:35,613
- Yes, Mortimer.
- What do you mean, "Yes, Mortimer"?

45
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,095
Aren't you insulted?
Aren't you going to cry?

46
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:41,058
- No, Mortimer.
- And don't "No, Mortimer" me, either!

47
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,011
Marriage is a superstition.

48
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:45,097
It's old-fashioned. It's...

49
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:31,168
O'Hara, don't be a jerk. You don't realize...

50
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:34,172
...I'm turning over to you
the nicest, best beat in Brooklyn.

51
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:37,058
Now look at that old church.
And them old houses.

52
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:39,736
Did George Washington ever sleep here?

53
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:43,449
Of course he did. This whole neighborhood
just stinks with atmosphere.

54
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:46,972
- And look at that old house.
- The original owners still there?

55
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:49,369
Don't crack wise
about the Brewster sisters.

56
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:53,499
They're two of the dearest, sweetest
old ladies that ever walked the earth.

57
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,332
They're out of this world.

58
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:59,291
They're like pressed rose leaves.

59
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:00,854
Pressed rose leaves?

60
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,251
The old girls must be kind of hard up.

61
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:07,176
Their old man left them fixed for life.

62
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:09,330
Don't you call them "the girls," either.

63
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:11,012
Brophy. Is Lieutenant around?

64
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,897
So what are they renting rooms for?

65
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:16,097
They don't. But you can bet
if anybody came looking for a room...

66
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:19,377
...they wouldn't go away
without a good meal and a couple of bucks.

67
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:23,088
That's their way of digging up people
to do good to.

68
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:33,857
Reverend Harper, I do hope
you don't disapprove of Mortimer...

69
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:38,172
...because he's a dramatic critic
and takes your daughter to the theater.

70
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:41,020
It's not that I disapprove
of his being a critic...

71
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:44,456
...but no man with this published attitude...

72
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:49,452
...should take any man's daughter
anyplace, at any time.

73
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,698
I must be catching cold.

74
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:56,738
No, dear. It was Reverend Harper
who sneezed. Bless you.

75
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,370
We mustn't be angry with Mortimer.

76
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:04,453
He's so very much in love with her.
Sister Martha and I are so happy.

77
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:07,777
He used to come to see us
only occasionally, and now...

78
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:10,170
...he's in Brooklyn six nights a week.

79
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:13,696
Remember now, watch your language.

80
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:15,737
You know I'm not a swearing man.

81
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:18,573
You'd be surprised
what they'd consider swearing.

82
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:24,569
Will you excuse me?
No, no, Teddy, dear. Thank you. I'll go.

83
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:30,895
- Come right in, Mr. Brophy.
- Miss Abby, we came for the toys.

84
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:33,614
This is Officer O'Hara.
He's taking over my beat.

85
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:36,658
- How do you do, miss?
- Welcome to our neighborhood.

86
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,890
Gentlemen, what news
have you brought me?

87
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:41,296
Colonel, we have nothing to report.

88
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:46,010
No, absolutely nothing to report.

89
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,094
Splendid!

90
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,416
Thank you, gentlemen. At ease.

91
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:54,812
You know the Reverend Dr. Harper
from the church next door?

92
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:58,210
Hello. This is Officer O'Hara,
the new man on the beat.

93
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,814
How do you do, sir? It's nice to meet you.

94
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:07,728
The toys are on the chair up here,
by the library door.

95
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:15,536
Teddy, run upstairs and bring down your
Army and Navy from Aunt Martha's room.

96
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,019
They're all packed.

97
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:23,176
That's splendid work you men do, fixing up
discarded toys for the kids at camp.

98
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,335
Charge!

99
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:36,975
It gives us something to do at the station.
You get tired of playing cards.

100
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:46,853
- So these are the toys?
- How's Mrs. Brophy?

101
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:49,659
She's better, thank you.
But a little weak, still.

102
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:52,379
I'll get some beef broth
for you to take to her.

103
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:55,179
Please don't bother.
You've done so much already.

104
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,689
Stop the nonsense! I won't be a minute.

105
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:07,291
Gentlemen, if I know what pure kindness
and absolute generosity are...

106
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:10,259
...it's because I've known
the Brewster sisters.

107
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:17,574
Teddy, you promised me
you wouldn't do that anymore.

108
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:20,652
But I have to call a Cabinet meeting
to get those supplies.

109
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:23,174
Now don't do that again. Do you hear me?

110
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:28,813
He used to do that at night...

111
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:31,539
...and the neighbors raised Cain.
They're afraid of him.

112
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:35,010
Look, Sarge, I promised I wouldn't swear,
but what the heck...

113
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:36,934
What's going on here?

114
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:39,614
- He's quite harmless.
- He thinks he's Teddy Roosevelt.

115
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:42,498
There's a lot of worse guys
he could think he was.

116
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,014
That's right.

117
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,495
I'll make a note.
He's an interesting character.

118
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,298
Isn't it a shame, Father...

119
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:54,819
Isn't it a shame, Reverend, that this nice
family should be hatching a cuckoo?

120
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:58,614
Well, now, isn't this nice!

121
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:01,214
- Good afternoon, Miss Brewster.
- How do you do?

122
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,973
- Good afternoon.
- Reverend, how do you do?

123
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,739
Miss Martha, Officer O'Hara.
He's taking over my duties.

124
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:07,935
How do you do?

125
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:10,250
- I'm very glad to know you.
- Thank you.

126
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:12,853
Martha, you're back.

127
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:15,977
Here's the broth for Mrs. Brophy.
Be sure it's good and hot.

128
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:18,369
You bet I will, and thank you very much.

129
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:20,769
The Army and Navy are ready for action.

130
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:23,813
Colonel, this is grand.
It'll make a lot of kids happy.

131
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,811
What's this? The Oregon?

132
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,891
Teddy, dear, put it back.

133
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:30,700
- But the Oregon goes to Australia.
- Now, Teddy...

134
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:32,532
No, it goes to Australia.

135
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,692
- These are lovely. Thank you.
- Not at all.

136
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:40,978
- The children will go crazy.
- Don't mention it.

137
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,573
So long, Colonel.

138
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:44,974
Hey, Sarge.

139
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:46,614
Yes.

140
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:49,449
Dismissed!

141
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:53,048
- Goodbye and thank you.
- Don't mention it.

142
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,939
- Careful of the step with the toys.
- Good night.

143
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,409
Young man, let that be a lesson to you.

144
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,979
Goodbye.

145
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:13,611
- Well, I must be going.
- Charge!

146
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:17,138
Charge the blockhouse!

147
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:24,889
Blockhouse?

148
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:28,135
The stairs are always San Juan Hill.

149
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,249
Bless you!

150
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:32,769
Have you tried to persuade him
he wasn't Roosevelt?

151
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:36,057
- Oh, no!
- He's so happy being Teddy Roosevelt.

152
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,536
Do you remember, Martha?

153
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:42,130
Once, a long time ago,
we thought if he'd be George Washington...

154
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:44,939
...it might be a change for him,
and we suggested it.

155
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,051
And do you know what happened?

156
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:50,530
He just stayed under his bed for days
and wouldn't be anybody.

157
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:54,890
Well, if he's happy, and what's
more important, you're happy...

158
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:57,580
Our only worry for Teddy
is after we're gone.

159
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:00,010
Yes, indeed. That is quite a problem.

160
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,568
Mortimer's made all the arrangements
for Teddy...

161
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:05,697
...to go to Happy Dale Sanitarium
after we pass on.

162
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:08,169
Splendid idea! A very pleasant place.

163
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,531
Dear, sweet Reverend Harper.

164
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:20,490
You know, Martha,
I do believe he's beginning to see the light.

165
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:22,411
I'm sure we needn't worry about him.

166
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,697
He won't interfere with our plans
for Mortimer and Elaine.

167
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:28,412
Did you just have tea?

168
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:29,456
Yes.

169
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,939
And dinner's going to be late, too.

170
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:35,298
So, why?

171
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:41,012
Good news for you.

172
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:44,649
You're going to Panama
and dig another lock for the canal.

173
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,852
Delighted!

174
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,011
That's bully! Just bully!

175
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,649
I shall prepare at once for the journey.

176
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:54,735
Charge!

177
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,816
Abby! While I was out?

178
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:05,334
Yes, dear. I just couldn't wait for you.

179
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,651
I didn't know when you'd be back,
and Reverend Harper was coming.

180
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:11,777
- But all by yourself.
- I got along fine.

181
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:14,500
- I'll run right downstairs and see.
- No, dear.

182
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:17,697
There wasn't time. And I was all alone.

183
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:21,690
Well?

184
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,934
Just look in the windowseat.

185
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,976
- It's Elaine!
- Hello, darlings.

186
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:45,771
- But, Elaine!
- What did she mean?

187
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:48,130
You don't suppose they've gone and...

188
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:53,775
Listen, buddy.

189
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:57,330
- This old cab has seen osculation but...
- You ain't seen anything yet.

190
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:00,014
- You've got to drive us to the station.
- Take her hat.

191
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:02,690
Wait a minute. And her brooch.

192
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:05,573
If you find her hairpins, keep them.
Hold on to that.

193
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:10,848
There they are.

194
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:12,694
Here's your hat.

195
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:16,008
Just throw it.
I don't like that look in your eyes.

196
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:19,934
- What's the matter with it?
- Father preached about it only last Sunday.

197
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:22,052
He did? What did he say?

198
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:24,819
- He was against it.
- But that was only Sunday.

199
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,291
Please! For heaven's sake!

200
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:33,054
But, Mortimer, right out here
with everyone looking?

201
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:35,608
Yes, right out here with everyone looking.

202
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,975
Let everyone in Brooklyn over 16 look.

203
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:50,612
But, Mortimer, you're going to love me
for my mind, too?

204
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:52,298
One thing at a time.

205
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:54,018
There's that look again!

206
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:59,177
"There's that look again, Mortimer! "
You better get used to it.

207
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:01,979
You'll see it often. It goes just before this.

208
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,896
You know what we're doing?
Wasting time.

209
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:08,016
I'll go tell my aunts and you tell your...

210
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:11,456
No, don't tell your father.
You'll run his cold into a pneumonia.

211
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,616
I can handle Father. He's a dear.

212
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:16,498
Look, why don't we wire him
from Niagara Falls?

213
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,299
Niagara Falls?

214
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,856
That's why you stopped at your office.

215
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:23,329
Yes, certainly!
We're going to go the whole hog.

216
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,854
Niagara Falls!
Everybody ought to go there.

217
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:28,449
You should've seen my secretary's face.

218
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:31,418
We've a room on the train,
the bridal suite in the hotel...

219
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,253
...and tomorrow morning
we go over the falls in a barrel.

220
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:37,138
Go on, darling, hurry and pack.

221
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:39,973
I don't have to.
I started packing the day after I met you.

222
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,857
There, you see! You see?

223
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:44,858
That's what I mean.
That's what I hate about women.

224
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:50,296
I wonder what Mary's doing now?

225
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:57,892
- The train leaves in an hour, hurry.
- It'll be a few minutes.

226
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:00,938
- Father may want to pray over me.
- Whistle when you're ready.

227
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,771
When you whistle, open the front door fast.

228
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:07,216
If you see a tall, dark streak of light,
it's me.

229
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:13,855
What? Now?

230
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,089
No, not now!

231
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:18,251
Look surprised when he tells us.

232
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,219
Hold on to your bustles.

233
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,689
We're married. Elaine and I are married.

234
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,452
Oh, darling, how wonderful!

235
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:28,610
Isn't it wonderful? They're married!

236
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:32,170
Don't pretend to be so surprised either,
you two old frauds.

237
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,936
- Can I use the telephone?
- Of course.

238
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:37,534
Isn't it too, too wonderful?

239
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:40,612
And to think that it happened
right here in this room!

240
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:42,008
Now, here.

241
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:45,370
Benson's Florists?
This is Mortimer Brewster.

242
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:48,133
Did you send those roses
to Mrs. Brewster? Good.

243
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:51,530
Send four dozen more to drawing room A,
Grand Central Station.

244
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:54,418
Hurry. And throw in a flock
of orange blossoms.

245
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,974
But before you go,
we can have our celebration.

246
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:59,210
I'll open a bottle of wine and we'll sing.

247
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:01,052
And we'll invite a few neighbors in.

248
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:04,689
- And, of course, a wedding cake.
- You won't have time to bake a cake.

249
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:07,015
We're going to Niagara Falls.
A taxi's waiting.

250
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,409
It's all ready. It's been ready since...

251
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,968
I bet it's been ready
since the first day I met her.

252
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:14,620
Did everybody know
I was getting married, except me?

253
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,214
We knew you'd find out about it in time.

254
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:21,210
I've got the two nicest aunts in the world.

255
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,973
Of course, you've got
the nicest nephew in the world, too.

256
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:26,980
Well, I'll run along
and get everything ready.

257
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:30,498
Oh, dear. I do hope the Reverend
isn't too angry.

258
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:32,298
You know how your books upset him.

259
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:36,168
I'm going to burn all my books.
I'll let the Reverend light the first match.

260
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:38,770
Did I leave some notes here
for my new book?

261
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:40,816
You mean Mind Over Matrimony

262
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,449
Where are they?

263
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:44,895
- I hid them someplace...
- Come along.

264
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:45,935
Now you behave.

265
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:48,409
Let's find them before Elaine sees them.

266
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,856
Hello, Mortimer!

267
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:59,290
- How are you, Mr. President?
- Bully, thank you. Just bully.

268
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:02,810
- What news have you brought me?
- The country's squarely behind you.

269
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,936
Yes, I know. Isn't it wonderful?

270
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:08,018
Well, goodbye. I'm off to Panama.

271
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,098
Goodbye, Mr. President.

272
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:12,336
A new lock for the canal, you know.

273
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:14,890
"Oh, tell the news to Mother"

274
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:18,980
- Oh, dear.
- Find those notes? What's wrong?

275
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:21,819
There's a baby picture
of your brother Jonathan.

276
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:26,611
You ought to put that in the fire
with my books. My, what a face!

277
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:29,215
I remember now.
He'd scare grownups with it.

278
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:31,575
Just the thought of Jonathan frightens me.

279
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:35,130
Do you remember how he used to cut
worms in two with his teeth?

280
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:40,015
Jonathan? He's probably in prison
or hanged or something by now.

281
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:43,531
I saw a play, had a character in it,
reminded me of Jonathan.

282
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:44,575
Really?

283
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:49,059
A honey of a lunatic. One of those
whodunits called Murder Will Out.

284
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,176
Oh, dear!

285
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:51,693
Yeah, what a play.

286
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:56,849
When the curtain goes up,
the first thing you see is a dead body.

287
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:58,539
The next thing...

288
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:10,969
Hey, mister.

289
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:44,969
- Happy bridegroom!
- Congratulations, darling!

290
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,736
Never mind that now.

291
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,578
Now, listen, darlings.

292
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:56,250
You know how we've always planned
to send Teddy to Happy Dale?

293
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,729
Yes, dear. That's after we're gone.

294
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:01,653
Yes, we talked with Reverend Harper
about it.

295
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:05,495
Teddy's got to go to Happy Dale now.
At once!

296
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:09,459
- He's in the cellar. Get him up here now.
- There's no such hurry as that.

297
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:13,494
When Teddy's working on the canal,
you can't get his mind on anything else.

298
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,733
Well, look, darlings.

299
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,892
I'm frightfully sorry,
but I've got an awful shock for you.

300
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:21,336
Teddy's killed a man, darlings!

301
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:23,329
Nonsense!

302
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:25,371
There's a body in the windowseat!

303
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:27,690
Yes, dear. We know.

304
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:32,890
- You know?
- Of course.

305
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,534
Yes, but it has nothing to do with Teddy.

306
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:39,213
Now, Mortimer. You just forget about it.

307
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:41,450
Forget you ever saw the gentleman.

308
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,050
Forget?

309
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:45,415
We never dreamed you'd peek.

310
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,334
What the...

311
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:49,489
Who is he?

312
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:52,612
He's a Mr. Hoskins. Adam Hoskins.

313
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:56,810
That's really all I know about him,
except that he's a Methodist.

314
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:59,175
He's a Methodist? Isn't that nice.

315
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:01,535
That's all you know?
What's he doing here?

316
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,611
- What happened to him?
- He died.

317
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:07,217
Aunt Martha, men just don't get
into windowseats and die.

318
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:10,093
No, dear. He died first.

319
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:12,018
Wait! Stop all this.

320
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:15,058
Now look, how did he die?

321
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:17,740
Mortimer, don't be so inquisitive.

322
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:22,930
The gentleman died because he drank
some wine with poison in it.

323
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:27,096
How did the poison get in the wine?

324
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:29,614
We put it in wine
because it's less noticeable.

325
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:32,134
When it's in tea, it has a distinct odor.

326
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:34,494
You mean you...

327
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:36,939
You put it in the wine?

328
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:40,376
Yes. And I put Mr. Hoskins
in the windowseat...

329
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:42,735
...because Reverend Harper was coming.

330
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,258
Look at me, darling.

331
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:52,775
You knew what you'd done and didn't want
Reverend Harper to see the body?

332
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:55,932
Well, not at tea.
That wouldn't have been very nice.

333
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:00,019
It's first-degree.

334
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:03,649
Now, Mortimer, you know all about it
and just forget about it.

335
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:07,899
I do think that Martha and I have the right
to our own little secrets.

336
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:14,975
Abby, while I was out I dropped in
on Mrs. Schultz. She's much better.

337
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:17,415
But she wants us to take Junior
to the movies again.

338
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,616
We must do that, tomorrow or next day.

339
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:22,658
Yes, but this time we'll go
where we want to go.

340
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:26,939
Junior's not going to drag me
into another one of those scary pictures.

341
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:31,459
They ought not to be allowed
to make pictures just to frighten people.

342
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:51,735
Operator?

343
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:53,971
Can you hear my voice?

344
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:55,929
You can?

345
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:57,574
Are you sure?

346
00:22:58,700 --> 00:22:59,974
Then I must be here.

347
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:29,818
The dears. Isn't Halloween
a wonderful time for them?

348
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:32,494
Yes, it is. They have so much fun.

349
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:36,255
Now, Mortimer, don't be so impatient.

350
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:38,735
- We'll let you lick the bowl.
- Lick the bowl?

351
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:41,288
I don't want to.
I want to know what we're going to do!

352
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:43,018
We're going to celebrate.

353
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:45,859
Celebrate? There's a body
in the windowseat!

354
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:47,737
Yes, dear. Mr. Hoskins.

355
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:51,097
I know what his name is. I want to know
what we're going to do.

356
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:54,172
- We can't turn you over to the police.
- Stop worrying about it.

357
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:56,371
We told you to forget the whole thing.

358
00:23:56,460 --> 00:24:00,692
Forget? Can't I make you realize
that something has to be done?

359
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:02,611
Now, Mortimer, you behave.

360
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:05,732
You're too old
to be flying off the handle like this.

361
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,775
- But Mr. Hodgekiss...
- Hoskins, dear.

362
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:11,328
Whatever his name is,
you can't leave him in there.

363
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:12,933
We don't intend to, dear.

364
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:16,057
Teddy's down in the cellar now,
digging the lock.

365
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:24,095
You're going to bury
Mr. Hodgekiss in the cellar?

366
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:26,774
Yes, dear.
That's what we did with the others.

367
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:29,970
Look, here, Aunt Martha. You can't...

368
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:33,413
- Others?
- The other gentlemen.

369
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:37,574
When you say "others,"
do you mean "others"?

370
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:40,494
- More than one "others"?
- Yes, dear.

371
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:43,612
Let me see now. This is 11, isn't it, Abby?

372
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:45,890
No, dear. This makes 12.

373
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:49,849
Abby, dear, I think you're wrong.
This one is only 11.

374
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:53,530
No, dear, because I remember
when Mr. Hoskins first came in...

375
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:56,657
...it occurred to me
that he'd make just an even dozen.

376
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:02,379
But, Abby, dear, I really don't think
you should count the first one.

377
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:05,617
I was counting the first one,
and that makes it 12.

378
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:07,009
It does?

379
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:11,612
Well, she's probably right. Abby usually is.

380
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,691
I get them mixed up sometimes.

381
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,249
Makes it 12.

382
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:23,249
Hello.

383
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:29,179
Whatever is the matter
with Mortimer today?

384
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:31,137
Why, Abby,
what do you think happened to him?

385
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:32,976
Hello?

386
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:41,973
Not now. For heaven's sake,
keep your shirt on!

387
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:45,858
Elaine, I didn't mean...

388
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:51,291
Now, let's see. Where were we?

389
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:52,699
Twelve. Twelve!

390
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,129
Yes, dear.

391
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,859
Abby thinks we should count the first one.

392
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:59,215
Never mind about that. Just sit down.

393
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:01,256
Tell me, who was the first one?

394
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:04,014
Mr. Midgely. He was a Baptist.

395
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:06,330
He was such a lonely, old gentleman.

396
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,970
All his kith and kin were dead.

397
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:11,016
We felt so sorry for him.

398
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:14,172
And then, when his heart attack came...

399
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:17,536
...and he sat there dead in that chair...

400
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:21,410
...looking so peaceful.
Remember, Martha?

401
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:24,729
We made up our minds, then and there...

402
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:27,778
...that if we could help
other lonely, old men...

403
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:30,050
...to find that same peace...

404
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,449
...we would.

405
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:33,768
Why, you poor...

406
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:36,619
You mean, he dropped dead
right in this chair?

407
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:42,771
And then, you see,
Teddy came up from digging in Panama...

408
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:46,097
...and he thought Mr. Midgely
was a yellow-fever victim.

409
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:49,298
And that meant
he had to be buried immediately.

410
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:52,612
So, we all took him down to Panama...

411
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:56,619
...and put him in the lock
and gave him a decent Christian burial.

412
00:26:56,940 --> 00:27:01,252
There, now you see? That's why
we told you not to bother about it...

413
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:04,093
...because we know exactly
what's to be done.

414
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:08,334
Wait a minute!

415
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:11,014
Come here, darling.
What about the others?

416
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:13,849
All 12 of them didn't walk in here
and drop dead.

417
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,858
No, dear. Of course not!

418
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:17,089
Well, so...

419
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,019
- Mortimer.
- What?

420
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:29,058
Do you remember those jars of poison
on the shelves...

421
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:31,415
...in Grandfather's laboratory
all these years?

422
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:34,298
You know your Aunt Martha's knack
for mixing things.

423
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:36,689
You've eaten enough of her piccalilli.

424
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:40,297
Well, dear, for a gallon of elderberry wine...

425
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:42,974
...I take one teaspoonful of arsenic...

426
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:45,369
...then add half a teaspoonful of strychnine.

427
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:49,089
And then, just a pinch of cyanide.

428
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,772
Should have quite a kick.

429
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:57,857
As a matter of fact,
one of our gentlemen found time to say:.

430
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:59,134
"How delicious! "

431
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:01,529
He did? Well, wasn't that nice of him?

432
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:04,618
Abby, we mustn't be standing here
gossiping all night.

433
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,213
We must get that cake frosted.

434
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:09,178
Don't worry about the cake.
I couldn't eat a thing.

435
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:13,248
You newlyweds! A sip of wine
will give you an appetite.

436
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:16,173
That'd be nice, darling, a sip of...
A sip of wine!

437
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:17,529
Wine!

438
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:39,700
I'm beginning to think the cat's in on this.

439
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:45,339
He's wonderful. Happy as a lark.
Singing away, digging locks.

440
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:47,854
Got him working on a yellow-fever victim.

441
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:50,092
I can see the headlines now:.

442
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:53,490
"Murder Incorporator Rides Again"
right across the front page.

443
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:55,448
Let me see...

444
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,819
Teddy! Of course.
Everybody knows he's crazy.

445
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:02,611
Let me see. Who can I call up?
Dewey, La Guardia, Winchell?

446
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,338
No, Winchell's no good.

447
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,374
Old Judge Cullman!

448
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:08,337
I wonder if I got his number.

449
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:11,097
What am I doing with tickets?

450
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:12,449
Information.

451
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:19,135
Information?

452
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:22,690
Get me the number of Judge Cullman
on North Shore Road, Brooklyn.

453
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:24,054
Yeah, would you call me back?

454
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:29,730
Wouldn't it be marvelous
if he wasn't there?

455
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:32,534
Hey, you!

456
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:36,454
Thought you were tall, dark streak of light.

457
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:38,253
What are you doing here?

458
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:41,053
What am I doing here?
Didn't you hear me whistle?

459
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:42,539
Whistle? Oh, yes.

460
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:44,339
I heard you whistle.

461
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:46,612
- How do I look?
- You look fine.

462
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:49,089
- Run on home. I'll call you up tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

463
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:51,978
You know I always call you up
every day or two.

464
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:55,496
You and your gags! Where's your hat?
The bags are in the taxi.

465
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:58,180
- Come on!
- I'm so sorry. Something's happened.

466
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,138
What'd you do, lose your nerve?

467
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:02,688
Where's that look
I was going to see so often?

468
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:07,169
Stop! Don't whistle in my ear, please.

469
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:09,332
What's wrong? Look at your hair.

470
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:11,490
What color is it? Has it turned?

471
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:14,852
Darling, what's the matter?
What happened?

472
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:18,132
Those flowers are so beautiful.

473
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:21,212
If I could only tell you, Elaine.
You smell so nice.

474
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,488
You better go home!

475
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:26,856
- But, darling, we were married today.
- Go to bed, get some rest!

476
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:27,816
Rest?

477
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:31,777
Who? Judge Cullman?

478
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:36,613
This is Mortimer Brewster. I'll tell you
why I called you. It's about Teddy.

479
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:38,736
I've got to come over
and see you right away.

480
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:40,697
It won't wait until tomorrow, Judge.

481
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:43,931
It's very, very important.
We've got to do something immediately.

482
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:45,976
But it's a matter of life and... Elaine!

483
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:48,889
Will you get out of here?

484
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:51,733
What on earth is going on here?
I don't know where I stand!

485
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:54,493
- Anywhere, but don't stand there!
- But Niagara Falls!

486
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:57,180
- If it does, we'll let it!
- Wait a minute! Listen.

487
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:59,330
You can't marry me
and then throw me out!

488
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:02,890
I'm not throwing you out of the house!
Will you get out of here?

489
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:09,097
I'm sorry, Judge. A thing happened.

490
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:11,132
Judge, about Teddy, he's...

491
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:14,419
It's his bugle blowing.

492
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:17,458
The police want to throw
him into a state institution.

493
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:20,333
How do you like that?

494
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:23,378
- I read an ad here about a room to rent.
- Shut up!

495
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:33,849
If you sign the papers and Teddy commits
himself, we can get him to Happy Dale.

496
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:35,612
It's a wonderful place.

497
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:36,689
You will?

498
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:39,414
Fine! I'll be over
as soon as I've made another call.

499
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:43,178
Doorbell's ringing, dear.

500
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:49,412
How do you do? Come in.

501
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:51,929
I understand you've got a room to rent.

502
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:53,652
Do step in.

503
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:57,091
- Are you the lady of the house?
- Yes, I'm Miss Brewster.

504
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:59,410
Operator? Give me long distance, please.

505
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:02,378
And this is my sister.
Another Miss Brewster.

506
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:05,691
- My name's Gibbs.
- Well, do sit down.

507
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:08,818
I'm sorry,
we're just setting the table for dinner.

508
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:13,209
Now, this would be
a nice comfortable chair.

509
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:17,728
Long distance? I want the Happy Dale
Sanitarium, Happy Dale, New York.

510
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:21,654
- Is Brooklyn your home?
- I live in a hotel. Don't like it.

511
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:25,375
Are your family Brooklyn people?

512
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:28,736
- Haven't got any family.
- All alone in the world?

513
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:32,898
- Well, Martha...
- No, Happy Dale.

514
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:36,298
Well, you've come to just the right house.

515
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:37,893
- Do sit down.
- Dale.

516
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:40,336
"D" like in "dig," when you dig a lock.

517
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:43,378
That's right.
"A" like in "arsenic". Got that?

518
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:45,851
Is there always this much noise?

519
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:47,658
He doesn't live with us.

520
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:49,970
I can see the headlines now. Please.

521
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:54,218
I'd like to see the room.
I don't think I'll like it.

522
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,733
The room's upstairs.

523
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:59,051
Won't you try a glass of our wine
before we start up?

524
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:00,539
Never touch it.

525
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:04,858
Well, we make this ourselves.
It's elderberry wine.

526
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,415
Elderberry?

527
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:12,733
I haven't tasted elderberry wine
since I was a boy.

528
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:14,139
- Thank you.
- Operator!

529
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:17,610
I don't want the Happy Dale Laundry!
I want the Happy Dale Sanitarium!

530
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:21,170
Sanitarium! Sanitarium!
Yes, like a broken record!

531
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:25,896
- Have your own elderberry bushes?
- No, but the cemetery's full of them.

532
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:28,138
Well, skoal.

533
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:30,979
Hello, operator! What's taking so long?

534
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:33,528
It's only across the river!
I could swim it faster!

535
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:34,450
Yes!

536
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:36,534
Hello! Hell...

537
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:37,930
What...

538
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:39,453
What, they're busy?

539
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:40,655
Busy?

540
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,818
They're busy and you're dizzy!

541
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:45,937
No, I'm not drunk, madam,
but you've given me an idea!

542
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:55,090
Darling, I'm nervous. Don't do that.

543
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:57,214
Not that.

544
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:09,936
Get out of here! Do you want
to be poisoned, murdered, killed?

545
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:15,568
They're nuts!

546
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:17,773
You're telling me!

547
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:28,173
Look, you can't do things like that!

548
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:37,738
Now I don't know
how I can explain this to you...

549
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:43,049
...but it's not only against the law,
it's wrong.

550
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:44,932
Oh, piffle!

551
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:47,137
It's not a nice thing to do.

552
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:51,131
People wouldn't understand.
He wouldn't understand.

553
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:55,292
What I mean is...

554
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:59,538
This is developing into a very bad habit!

555
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:09,251
Who? Happy Dale Sanitarium?

556
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:11,172
That's amazing, operator.

557
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:14,214
Happy Dale?
Let me talk to Mr. Witherspoon, please.

558
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,938
Mr. Witherspoon speaking.

559
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:18,929
How do you do, Mr. Brewster?
How are you?

560
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:23,611
Mr. Witherspoon, do you...
I'm fine, thanks. How are you?

561
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:28,089
Do you remember our conversation about
committing my brother to Happy Dale?

562
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:30,933
You do? Well, we want
to commit him there immediately.

563
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:32,050
Oh, dear.

564
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:33,898
Oh, dear. That's too bad.

565
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:37,817
Well, I'd hoped we wouldn't have him
for some time yet.

566
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:41,012
We have several Theodore Roosevelts
at the moment...

567
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:43,176
...and it would lead to trouble.

568
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:46,571
Well, now, if he thought that...

569
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:50,249
Mr. Brewster, we're a bit short
of Napoleons at present.

570
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:52,451
Bonaparte. And if...

571
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:56,258
Oh, I see. Of course.

572
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:59,259
Well, if your mind is made up. Yes.

573
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:01,453
Have you had the papers drawn up?

574
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:04,338
No, but I'll do it now
and call you as soon as I have them.

575
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:06,339
Thank you, Mr... What?

576
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:08,816
All right. Thank you, Mr. Witherspoon.

577
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:12,090
Another Roosevelt. Oh, dear.

578
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:17,056
Now listen, I'm going to Judge Cullman's,
but I want you to promise me something.

579
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:19,608
Well, we'd have to know what it was first.

580
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:21,851
I love you both very much.

581
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:24,255
You know I'd do anything for you,
don't you?

582
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:25,409
Yes, dear.

583
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:28,088
I want you to do one thing for me,
like good girls.

584
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:29,579
What do you want us to do?

585
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:32,697
Don't do anything.
I mean, don't do anything!

586
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:36,132
Don't let anyone in the house
and leave Mr. Whosit where he is.

587
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:39,735
Get off that thing. I can't talk to you...
I can't concentrate.

588
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:42,738
I wouldn't want anything
in the world to happen to you.

589
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:45,175
What on earth could happen to us?

590
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:46,534
Well, darling...

591
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:49,299
Anyway, you'll do that little thing for me,
won't you?

592
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:51,537
Where's my hat? There it is.

593
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:53,258
- But, Mortimer.
- What?

594
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:56,696
We were planning to hold services
before dinner.

595
00:36:57,180 --> 00:37:00,855
- Couldn't that wait until I get back?
- You could join us in the hymns!

596
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:04,057
Yes, darling, I'll sing with you,
I'll dance with you, anything.

597
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:07,737
Remember, don't let anybody in the house
until I get back.

598
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:08,969
You promise?

599
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:10,175
Good.

600
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:13,295
What?

601
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:16,892
Stop that. What is it?

602
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:18,573
Mr. Hoskins' hat!

603
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:26,893
- Do you still want me to wait?
- Yes! Call me a cab!

604
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:30,689
- Hey, cab! Here you are.
- Don't open it. I'll sit with you!

605
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:34,256
Yeah, that's right.
I can go faster that way. Sure.

606
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,491
Wait a minute! What am I doing?

607
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:44,295
Fancy getting nice Mr. Hoskins' hat
all mussed up.

608
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:47,380
Shame! Such a nice hat.

609
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:52,657
You know, Mortimer didn't seem
to be quite himself today.

610
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:55,775
Oh, well.

611
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:05,969
What were you saying about Mortimer?

612
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:08,858
I think I understand why
he seemed so upset.

613
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:09,930
Why?

614
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:12,337
He's just been married.

615
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:16,338
I believe that always makes
a man a little nervous.

616
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:18,058
Yes. The poor dears.

617
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:22,816
I'm so happy for Elaine.

618
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:24,610
Abby!

619
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:28,859
If Mortimer's coming back for the services,
we'll need another hymnal.

620
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:30,852
There's one up in my room.

621
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:34,858
I'll go, dear.

622
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:39,292
We promised Mortimer
we wouldn't let anyone come in.

623
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:47,169
It's two men,
and I've never seen them before.

624
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:49,137
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

625
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:51,976
- Let me look.
- You look.

626
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:58,658
- Do you recognize them?
- No, they're strangers to me.

627
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:04,020
We'll just have to pretend
we're not at home.

628
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:35,453
Come in, doctor.

629
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:41,417
This is the home of my youth.

630
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:45,737
As a boy, I couldn't wait to escape
from this house.

631
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:49,374
Now I'm glad to escape back into it.

632
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,770
Yes, Johnny, it's a good hideout.

633
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:56,451
The family must still live here.

634
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:02,615
I hope there's a fatted calf
awaiting the return of the prodigal.

635
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,094
A fatted calf?

636
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:06,931
Johnny, I'm so hungry.

637
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:09,490
Look, Johnny. Drink.

638
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:12,211
As if we were expected.

639
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:13,649
A good omen.

640
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:15,778
Who are you?

641
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:17,778
What are you doing here?

642
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:21,849
Aunt Abby. Aunt Martha.

643
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:24,854
It's Jonathan.

644
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:26,973
You get out of here!

645
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:29,372
I'm Jonathan, you know.

646
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:31,652
Your nephew, Jonathan.

647
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:33,088
No, you're not.

648
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:36,257
You're nothing like Jonathan,
so don't pretend you are.

649
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,058
You just get out of here.

650
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:41,132
I see you're still wearing
the lovely garnet ring...

651
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:43,728
...that Grandma Brewster
bought in England.

652
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:47,413
And you, Aunt Martha,
still the high collar...

653
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:50,970
...to hide the scar
where Grandfather's acid burned you.

654
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:54,573
Why, his voice is like Jonathan's.

655
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:59,294
Have you been in an accident?

656
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:00,733
My face.

657
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:04,659
Dr. Einstein is responsible for that.

658
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:06,578
He's a plastic surgeon.

659
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:09,449
But I've seen that face before.

660
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:15,291
Do you remember when we took
the little Schultz boy to the movies...

661
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:16,972
...and I was so frightened?

662
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:18,413
It was that face.

663
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:23,771
Take it easy, Johnny. Take it easy.

664
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:27,057
Don't worry. The last five years,
I give him three different faces.

665
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:29,210
I give him another one right away.

666
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:32,890
That last face. I saw that picture, too...

667
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:37,372
...just before I operated. I was intoxicated.

668
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:40,020
You see, doctor, what you've done to me?

669
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:43,332
- Even my own family think I'm...
- Johnny, Johnny!

670
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:47,135
You are home in this lovely house.

671
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:48,774
You know...

672
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:52,774
...how many times he tells me...

673
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:56,456
...about Brooklyn, about this house
and about his aunts...

674
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:58,098
...he loves so much?

675
00:41:58,420 --> 00:41:59,569
They know you.

676
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:01,378
Please tell him so.

677
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:05,892
Jonathan...

678
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:07,818
...it's been a long time.

679
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:10,534
Bless you. It's good to be home again.

680
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:18,419
We mustn't let what's on the stove
boil over.

681
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:22,660
If you'll excuse us for a moment, Jonathan.

682
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:26,256
Unless you're in a hurry to go somewhere.

683
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:46,811
Where do we go from here?

684
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:50,855
You know, we got to think fast.

685
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:55,812
The police got pictures of that face.
I got to operate on you right away.

686
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:57,938
We got to find someplace.

687
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:02,298
We got to find someplace
for Mr. Spenalzo, too.

688
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:05,176
Don't waste any worry on that rat.

689
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:08,338
But we got a hot stiff on our hands.

690
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:10,458
Forget Mr. Spenalzo.

691
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:13,977
But, Johnny, we can't leave
a dead body in the rumble seat.

692
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:16,332
You shouldn't have killed him.

693
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:19,730
Just because he knows something
about us, what happens?

694
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:25,652
We come to him for help
and he tries to shake us down.

695
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:32,573
Besides, he said I looked like Boris Karloff.

696
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:37,252
That's your work, doctor.

697
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:38,739
You did that to me.

698
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:40,731
Please, Johnny, take it easy.

699
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:44,091
We'll find some place
and I'll fix you up right away.

700
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:46,740
Yes, tonight, but I have to eat first.

701
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:49,938
This time, I want the face
of an absolute nonentity.

702
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:53,417
Yes. I know exactly what I'm going to do.

703
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:56,890
You see, I'm going to take this piece here
and lift it up...

704
00:43:56,980 --> 00:43:59,050
Be careful about the stitches this time.

705
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:00,812
You leave that up to me.

706
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:02,413
I'll give you nice ears and...

707
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:05,219
- You were careless last time.
- And new stitches.

708
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:08,537
And on the eyes I'll do a Schmidt.
That's my specialty.

709
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:11,891
- I take it together like this...
- Leave the eyes alone.

710
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:13,652
Leave the nose alone.

711
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:15,333
Poor Teddy.

712
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:17,976
I imagine it's for the best.

713
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:23,776
"Ours not to reason why, ours but to do... "

714
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:26,368
Sign right here, please, Judge. Excuse me.

715
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:27,979
Right there.

716
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:31,968
Sometimes I think,
with the world in its present chaotic state...

717
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:35,894
Yes, we'd all be better off at Happy Dale.
I sign here as next of kin, don't I?

718
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:39,775
Only last week I created a mild sensation...

719
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:42,772
...at the Bar Association, when I said...

720
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:44,936
Goodbye. Good luck, Judge. Thank you.

721
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:48,979
Tell Martha and Abby I'll be over this week.
I've been feeling rather lonely.

722
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:51,933
No! Never tell them
you've been lonely. Never!

723
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:54,409
- Why, I don't...
- Judge!

724
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:57,330
Tell me, are you a drinking man?

725
00:44:57,620 --> 00:45:00,293
Why, no. I never indulge.

726
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:02,331
Good! Then you'll live longer.

727
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:04,536
Of course a little wine now...

728
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:06,770
No! For heaven's sake, no wine!

729
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:11,854
I may be committing the wrong Brewster.

730
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:17,330
Well, I'm sure you both want to get
to wherever you're going.

731
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:21,733
My dear, sweet aunties,
I'm so full of your delicious dinner...

732
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:25,615
- ...I'm unable to move a muscle.
- Yes, it's nice here.

733
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:27,219
I found it!

734
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:31,093
Gentlemen, be seated.

735
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:37,092
Here it is, gentlemen.
The story of my life, my biography.

736
00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:40,252
Here's the picture I was telling you about.
Here we both are.

737
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:42,934
President Roosevelt and General Goethals
at Culebra Cut.

738
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:45,216
That's me, General, and that's you.

739
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:48,216
My, how I've changed!

740
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:53,132
That picture hasn't been taken yet.
We haven't started work on Culebra Cut.

741
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:54,739
We're still digging locks.

742
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:58,574
And now, General, we will both go
to Panama and inspect the new lock.

743
00:45:58,660 --> 00:46:00,730
No, Teddy. Not to Panama.

744
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:04,699
Maybe some other time, Mr. President.
Panama is a long ways off.

745
00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:07,533
- Nonsense! It's just down in the cellar.
- The cellar?

746
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:11,291
We let him dig the Panama Canal
in the cellar.

747
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:13,931
- General Goethals?
- Yes, sir.

748
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:17,098
As President of the US, Commander
in Chief of the Army and Navy...

749
00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:19,136
...and the man who gave you this job...

750
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:22,769
...I demand that you accompany me
on the inspection of the new lock.

751
00:46:22,860 --> 00:46:25,169
I think it's time for you to go to bed.

752
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:28,936
I beg your pardon. Who are you?

753
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:30,931
I'm Woodrow Wilson. Go to bed.

754
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:36,291
No, you're not Wilson.
But your face is familiar.

755
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:41,013
You're not anyone I know now.
Perhaps later, on my hunting trip to Africa.

756
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:43,853
You look like someone
I might meet in the jungle.

757
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:47,617
I think, perhaps,
you had better go to bed, Teddy.

758
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:50,578
He and his friend want to get back
to their hotel.

759
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:53,057
General Goethals, inspect the canal.

760
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:56,574
All right, Mr. President, we go to Panama.

761
00:46:56,740 --> 00:46:59,413
Bully, bully! Follow me, General.

762
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,731
It's down south, you know.

763
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:09,379
Well, bon voyage!

764
00:47:14,420 --> 00:47:16,570
I must correct your misapprehension.

765
00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:19,497
You talked of our hotel.

766
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:23,135
We have no hotel. We came here directly.

767
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:27,499
This is not your home,
and I'm afraid you can't stay here.

768
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:35,449
Dr. Einstein and I need a place to sleep.

769
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:39,052
You remember that, as a boy,
I could be disagreeable.

770
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:43,131
It would not be pleasant for any of us if...

771
00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:45,973
I don't have to go into details, do I?

772
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:49,008
Perhaps we'd better let them
stay here tonight.

773
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:52,618
Come here. Quick.

774
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:53,769
I forgot to tell you...

775
00:47:53,860 --> 00:47:58,058
...Doctor and I are turning Grandfather's
laboratory into an operating room.

776
00:47:58,220 --> 00:48:00,256
We expect to be very busy.

777
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:06,694
- Down here, what do you think I find?
- What?

778
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:08,577
The Panama Canal.

779
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:11,330
And it just fits Mr. Spenalzo.

780
00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:15,496
See the hole he's digging.
Four feet wide, six feet long.

781
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:16,933
He just fits!

782
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:20,370
You'd think he knew
we were bringing Mr. Spenalzo along.

783
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:22,298
That's hospitality.

784
00:48:22,740 --> 00:48:24,617
Rather a good joke on my aunts.

785
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:27,976
They're living in a house
with a body buried in the cellar.

786
00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:32,451
How do we get him in here?

787
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:36,653
Yes, we can't just walk
Mr. Spenalzo in through the door.

788
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:41,251
We'll get the car and after they're in bed,
we'll bring him in through the window.

789
00:48:41,340 --> 00:48:42,216
Bed.

790
00:48:44,740 --> 00:48:48,016
We're moving the car behind the house.
You'd better get to bed.

791
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:50,694
The car is all right where it is
until morning.

792
00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:54,739
I don't want to leave it in the street.
That might be against the law.

793
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:02,137
What are we going to do?

794
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:06,253
We're not going to let them spend
more than one night in this house.

795
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:08,212
What would the neighbors think?

796
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:11,770
People coming in here with one face
and going out with another.

797
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:15,134
What are we going to do
about Mr. Hoskins?

798
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:17,292
Mr. Hoskins!

799
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:20,458
It can't be very comfortable
for him in there.

800
00:49:20,740 --> 00:49:23,812
And he's been so patient, the poor dear.

801
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:29,253
I think Teddy had better take
Mr. Hoskins downstairs right away.

802
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:34,458
General Goethals was very pleased.
He said the canal was just the right size.

803
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:39,695
Teddy, there's been
another yellow-fever victim.

804
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:43,370
Dear me!
This will be a shock to the General.

805
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:46,853
No, we must keep it a secret.

806
00:49:48,340 --> 00:49:49,534
A state secret?

807
00:49:49,660 --> 00:49:51,491
Yes, a state secret.

808
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:52,689
Promise?

809
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:56,173
You have the word of the President
of the United States.

810
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:59,730
Cross my heart and hope to die.
Now, let's see.

811
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:02,769
How are we going to keep it a secret?

812
00:50:02,980 --> 00:50:06,416
Teddy, I think you'd better get back down
into the cellar.

813
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:07,729
And then...

814
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:11,489
...when I turn out the lights,
when everything's dark here...

815
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:14,499
...you come up and take
the poor man down to the canal.

816
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:15,729
Now get along.

817
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:18,858
And we'll come down later
and hold services.

818
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:22,169
- Where is the poor devil?
- In the windowseat.

819
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:23,659
It seems to be spreading.

820
00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:26,300
We've never had yellow fever there before.

821
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:33,378
I've never even seen Mr. Hoskins!

822
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:36,816
My goodness! That's right, you were out.

823
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:41,011
You just come right along
and see him now.

824
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:46,576
You know, he's really very nice looking,
considering that he's a Methodist.

825
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:05,055
We're bringing the luggage through here.

826
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:14,889
Your room is waiting for you.
You can go right up.

827
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:19,534
I'm afraid we don't keep Brooklyn hours.
You two run along to bed.

828
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:22,817
But you must be very tired. Both of you.

829
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:26,973
- And we don't go to bed this early.
- It's time I came home to take care of you.

830
00:51:27,220 --> 00:51:29,051
Take the bags upstairs.

831
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:32,019
For the instruments, I'll come back later.

832
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:33,574
Good night.

833
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:35,533
Now, we'll all go to bed.

834
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:39,329
I'll wait until you're up
and then turn out the lights.

835
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:41,817
Run along, Aunt Martha.

836
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:45,250
Just off the laboratory, Doctor.

837
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:55,168
- All right, Aunt Abby.
- I'll be right up.

838
00:51:55,340 --> 00:51:57,570
Now! Turn out the lights.

839
00:52:28,060 --> 00:52:29,539
Aunt Abby.

840
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:30,888
He's all right, Johnny.

841
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:42,978
I'll open the window.
You go round and hand him through.

842
00:54:43,180 --> 00:54:45,455
But he's too heavy for me.

843
00:54:46,940 --> 00:54:50,330
You go outside and push,
and I'll stay here and pull.

844
00:54:50,540 --> 00:54:53,259
And then together we take him
down to Panama.

845
00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:57,329
All right. We must be quick.
I'll take a look around outside the house.

846
00:54:57,540 --> 00:55:00,008
When I tap on the glass,
you open the window.

847
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:01,055
Yeah.

848
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:10,332
It's dark in here.

849
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:24,415
Where am I?

850
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:26,575
Here I am.

851
00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:30,300
Who left this open?

852
00:55:35,380 --> 00:55:38,338
Okay, wait a minute. Hand him over.

853
00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:41,100
Now I have him. Allez, up!

854
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:46,254
Now, wait a minute.
You lost a leg somewhere.

855
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:50,577
Help me. He's so heavy.

856
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:53,931
Now I have him. Now I got him.

857
00:55:54,860 --> 00:55:58,057
- Be careful.
- But his shoe came off.

858
00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:01,858
Help me. He's so heavy.

859
00:56:02,060 --> 00:56:04,176
Now I've got him!

860
00:56:05,780 --> 00:56:08,897
Johnny, somebody's at the door.
Go open, quick.

861
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:12,172
I'll manage Spenalzo. Go, quick!

862
00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:26,249
Mortimer!

863
00:56:30,940 --> 00:56:32,009
Aunt Abby!

864
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:35,094
Aunt Martha!

865
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:41,295
Who is it?

866
00:56:41,380 --> 00:56:42,813
Is that you, Teddy?

867
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:43,855
Who are you?

868
00:56:43,940 --> 00:56:46,170
I'm Elaine Harper. I live next door.

869
00:56:46,420 --> 00:56:48,058
What are you doing here?

870
00:56:48,140 --> 00:56:50,449
I came here to see my husband, Mortimer.

871
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:52,690
Why did you say your name was Harper?

872
00:56:52,780 --> 00:56:54,691
It is Harper. I mean, it's Brewster.

873
00:56:54,780 --> 00:56:57,374
I'm not very used to it.
I'm a brand-new Brewster.

874
00:56:57,460 --> 00:56:58,415
Doctor!

875
00:56:59,660 --> 00:57:01,491
It's all right. It's okay.

876
00:57:10,740 --> 00:57:13,208
Maybe you'd better explain
what you're doing here.

877
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:15,256
We happen to live here.

878
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:17,019
You don't live here.

879
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:19,694
I'm in this house every day,
I've never seen you before.

880
00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:22,852
Where are Martha and Abby?
What have you done to them?

881
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:26,329
Perhaps we'd better introduce ourselves.

882
00:57:26,740 --> 00:57:29,254
May I present Dr. Einstein?

883
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:31,656
Dr. Einstein?

884
00:57:31,820 --> 00:57:34,209
A surgeon of great distinction.

885
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:38,570
And something of a magician.

886
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:43,009
- I suppose you'll tell me you're Boris...
- I am Jonathan Brewster.

887
00:57:45,260 --> 00:57:47,649
- You're Jonathan.
- You've heard of me?

888
00:57:47,820 --> 00:57:50,732
- Yes, they talk about you.
- What do they say about me?

889
00:57:50,820 --> 00:57:54,176
Just that there's another brother
named Jonathan, that's all.

890
00:57:54,860 --> 00:57:57,897
That explains everything.
Now that I know who you are...

891
00:57:58,060 --> 00:58:01,496
...I'll just be running along
if you'll kindly unlock the door.

892
00:58:13,940 --> 00:58:17,410
"That explains everything".
Just what do you mean by that?

893
00:58:17,540 --> 00:58:20,008
Why do you come here
at this time of night?

894
00:58:20,140 --> 00:58:23,815
I just thought I saw Mortimer drive up.
I suppose it was you.

895
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:29,249
You thought you saw someone drive up?

896
00:58:29,620 --> 00:58:32,373
Yes. Weren't you just outside?
Isn't that your car?

897
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:34,849
- You saw someone at the car?
- Yes.

898
00:58:35,060 --> 00:58:37,699
- What else did you see?
- Just that, that's all!

899
00:58:37,820 --> 00:58:40,653
I see. Is that why you came over here?

900
00:58:40,740 --> 00:58:44,176
No, I came to see Mortimer.
But if he's not home, I'll run...

901
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:46,256
- You've given two names.
- You're hurting me!

902
00:58:46,340 --> 00:58:48,410
I think she's dangerous.

903
00:58:48,540 --> 00:58:50,895
No visitors. It's going to be
a private funeral.

904
00:58:54,660 --> 00:58:58,050
- Tell these men who I am!
- That's my daughter, Alice.

905
00:58:58,380 --> 00:58:59,176
No!

906
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:03,219
Don't be a tomboy.
Don't play rough with the gentlemen.

907
00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:04,289
Charge!

908
00:59:13,180 --> 00:59:14,659
Doctor, the cellar.

909
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:18,138
Let go of me!

910
00:59:18,860 --> 00:59:20,532
Let go of me!

911
00:59:21,580 --> 00:59:23,775
What's the matter?
What's happening down there?

912
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:30,014
What's the matter?
What are you doing there?

913
00:59:30,380 --> 00:59:33,690
We caught a burglar, a sneak thief.
Go back to your room.

914
00:59:33,860 --> 00:59:37,489
- We'll call the police.
- I'll handle this. Go back to your room.

915
00:59:38,180 --> 00:59:39,408
Do you hear me?

916
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:43,579
Don't answer that.

917
00:59:44,580 --> 00:59:46,013
Don't answer that!

918
00:59:58,940 --> 01:00:02,728
Where's Teddy? Is he upstairs?
Never mind that now, darling.

919
01:00:02,820 --> 01:00:05,459
What are you doing
with your best clothes on?

920
01:00:05,980 --> 01:00:08,050
Holy... What's that?

921
01:00:10,140 --> 01:00:12,700
What's that thing that looks like
a cigar-store dummy?

922
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:17,217
- It's your brother and Dr. Einstein.
- Didn't I tell you not to let anybody in?

923
01:00:17,300 --> 01:00:20,451
- Who did you say it was?
- It's your brother, Jonathan!

924
01:00:25,220 --> 01:00:28,053
- I've come back home, Mortimer.
- What?

925
01:00:28,420 --> 01:00:30,251
I've come back home, Mortimer.

926
01:00:30,340 --> 01:00:33,457
"I've come back home, Mortimer".
Listen, it talks!

927
01:00:34,860 --> 01:00:36,452
Yes, I talk.

928
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:41,098
Mortimer, have you forgotten
the things I used to do to you...

929
01:00:41,460 --> 01:00:43,530
...when you were tied to the bedpost?

930
01:00:43,620 --> 01:00:47,010
The needles under your fingernails.

931
01:00:47,220 --> 01:00:49,131
- Mortimer, he...
- Wait a minute.

932
01:00:56,860 --> 01:00:58,452
Holy mackerel!

933
01:00:58,660 --> 01:00:59,695
It is Jonathan!

934
01:00:59,780 --> 01:01:01,577
I'm glad you remember, Mortimer.

935
01:01:03,180 --> 01:01:04,579
Yeah, I remember.

936
01:01:05,020 --> 01:01:06,658
How could I forget you?

937
01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:09,375
Where'd you get that face? Hollywood?

938
01:01:10,020 --> 01:01:14,298
Don't you two boys start quarreling
the minute you've seen each other.

939
01:01:14,380 --> 01:01:17,656
We invited Jonathan
and Dr. Einstein to stay.

940
01:01:18,100 --> 01:01:20,091
- What?
- Just for tonight.

941
01:01:20,220 --> 01:01:22,097
No, I'm staying here tonight.

942
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:24,780
- In fact, I'm staying here from now on.
- What about me?

943
01:01:24,860 --> 01:01:26,816
There's no room for anybody else here.

944
01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:28,299
Please, just a moment.

945
01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:30,655
So take that little squirt and beat it!

946
01:01:30,860 --> 01:01:33,499
Where's Teddy?
I've got to see him right away.

947
01:01:34,660 --> 01:01:36,332
We don't take up much room.

948
01:01:36,420 --> 01:01:39,617
Johnny can sleep on the sofa,
and I'll sleep on the windowseat.

949
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:40,974
Nothing to...

950
01:01:41,260 --> 01:01:42,613
Windowseat?

951
01:01:43,380 --> 01:01:44,893
Certainly not on the windowseat.

952
01:01:44,980 --> 01:01:47,210
I'm going to sleep on the windowseat.

953
01:01:47,580 --> 01:01:49,411
I'll sleep on the windowseat from now on.

954
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:52,489
Now look.

955
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:54,893
Now, be a good fellow.

956
01:01:54,980 --> 01:01:57,699
Here's $10. Go out
and haunt yourself a hotel.

957
01:02:00,220 --> 01:02:04,179
Mortimer, you know what I do
to people who order me around.

958
01:02:07,380 --> 01:02:08,893
Mr. Spenalzo.

959
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:09,976
What?

960
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:13,297
What's going to happen to Mr. Spenalzo?

961
01:02:14,460 --> 01:02:17,213
We can't leave him here
in the windowseat.

962
01:02:22,580 --> 01:02:25,936
Doctor, I've completely lost track
of Mr. Spenalzo.

963
01:02:26,100 --> 01:02:28,489
Wait! Who's this Mr. Spenalzo?

964
01:02:28,660 --> 01:02:30,969
A friend of ours Johnny was looking for.

965
01:02:31,060 --> 01:02:33,528
Don't bring anyone else in here.
Now, beat it!

966
01:02:33,620 --> 01:02:34,973
It's all right, Johnny.

967
01:02:35,060 --> 01:02:37,654
While we are packing,
I'll tell you about him.

968
01:02:43,860 --> 01:02:46,932
I'll take care of you, Mortimer,
in just a little while.

969
01:02:48,020 --> 01:02:49,294
How do you like that?

970
01:02:49,380 --> 01:02:52,656
The guy stays away for 20 years
and picks tonight to come back.

971
01:02:52,740 --> 01:02:54,651
Elaine, what are you doing here?

972
01:02:54,780 --> 01:02:56,975
- Mortimer!
- What's the matter, darling?

973
01:02:57,060 --> 01:03:00,052
- I almost got killed.
- Killed?

974
01:03:01,020 --> 01:03:02,453
Aunt Abby, Aunt Martha!

975
01:03:03,820 --> 01:03:05,492
No! It was Jonathan!

976
01:03:05,860 --> 01:03:07,896
He mistook her for a sneak thief.

977
01:03:07,980 --> 01:03:10,096
- Oh, that.
- It was worse than that.

978
01:03:10,220 --> 01:03:11,938
He's some kind of a maniac.

979
01:03:12,020 --> 01:03:13,373
I'm afraid of him.

980
01:03:13,460 --> 01:03:16,099
Darling, don't worry about it.
I'm here now. Forget it.

981
01:03:16,220 --> 01:03:19,178
We were married today,
we were going over Niagara Falls...

982
01:03:19,260 --> 01:03:22,616
...your brother tries to strangle me,
a taxi's waiting...

983
01:03:22,820 --> 01:03:25,015
...and now you want to sleep
on a windowseat!

984
01:03:25,100 --> 01:03:26,931
Windowseat. Witherspoon.

985
01:03:27,180 --> 01:03:29,136
- You'd better run along home.
- What?

986
01:03:29,220 --> 01:03:31,939
Go on home like a good girl.
I got things to do.

987
01:03:32,020 --> 01:03:33,294
- But...
- Please.

988
01:03:33,580 --> 01:03:36,094
Operator?
Get me Happy Dale 2-7-0, please.

989
01:03:36,380 --> 01:03:38,769
But didn't you hear what I was just saying?

990
01:03:38,860 --> 01:03:41,897
Your own brother Jonathan,
he was trying to strangle me!

991
01:03:42,020 --> 01:03:44,295
- Please! This is important!
- That?

992
01:03:44,980 --> 01:03:47,130
Mr. Witherspoon?
This is Mortimer Brewster.

993
01:03:47,220 --> 01:03:49,256
Yes, Mr. Brewster.

994
01:03:49,780 --> 01:03:52,089
Well, I don't understand you.

995
01:03:52,180 --> 01:03:55,013
- He was going to kill me!
- Wait, I can't hear the man.

996
01:03:55,100 --> 01:03:57,250
Well, look.
I've got the papers all drawn up.

997
01:03:57,340 --> 01:04:01,697
I know it's late, but come down here
and get my brother immediately!

998
01:04:01,820 --> 01:04:02,855
Please, darling.

999
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:06,774
By the way, you've had the papers signed
by your brother and the doctor, of course?

1000
01:04:06,860 --> 01:04:08,009
By the doctor?

1001
01:04:08,140 --> 01:04:10,973
Oh, holy mackerel! I forgot the doctor!

1002
01:04:12,900 --> 01:04:15,812
Please, be quiet! Can't you see
I've got to get a doctor?

1003
01:04:16,100 --> 01:04:18,136
What kind of a doctor? A family doctor?

1004
01:04:18,220 --> 01:04:21,576
You can take your honeymoon,
wedding ring, taxi, windowseat...

1005
01:04:21,660 --> 01:04:24,538
...put them in a barrel,
and push them all over Niagara Falls!

1006
01:04:24,620 --> 01:04:26,292
Thank you, darling. Thank you.

1007
01:04:26,380 --> 01:04:28,814
Why don't you come down here anyway?

1008
01:04:28,900 --> 01:04:32,449
While you're getting here,
I'll get Teddy's and the doctor's signatures.

1009
01:04:33,780 --> 01:04:36,772
I'll get both signatures.
Yeah, well, come right away.

1010
01:04:37,380 --> 01:04:39,132
What's the matter with her?

1011
01:04:49,180 --> 01:04:52,058
Let me sit down.
Let me think about this thing.

1012
01:04:53,180 --> 01:04:55,933
Doctor, Teddy, signature...

1013
01:04:56,700 --> 01:04:57,928
Hoskins!

1014
01:05:15,740 --> 01:05:17,856
Ye gods! There's another one!

1015
01:05:19,180 --> 01:05:20,533
Aunt Abby! Aunt Martha!

1016
01:05:20,620 --> 01:05:22,736
- Come in here!
- We're busy.

1017
01:05:22,820 --> 01:05:24,811
No, you come in here now!

1018
01:05:26,700 --> 01:05:29,134
Yes, dear, what is it? Where's Elaine?

1019
01:05:29,340 --> 01:05:31,535
Didn't you promise not to let anyone in?

1020
01:05:31,620 --> 01:05:33,850
- Jonathan just walked in.
- I don't mean Jonathan!

1021
01:05:33,940 --> 01:05:36,898
I don't mean Dr. Einstein!
Who is that in the windowseat?

1022
01:05:36,980 --> 01:05:38,652
We told you. Mr. Hoskins.

1023
01:05:38,740 --> 01:05:41,095
It is not Mr. Hoskins!

1024
01:05:41,820 --> 01:05:42,775
There!

1025
01:05:44,860 --> 01:05:46,179
Who can that be?

1026
01:05:48,620 --> 01:05:52,056
- Are you saying you've never seen him?
- I certainly am.

1027
01:05:52,220 --> 01:05:53,858
This is a fine how-do-you-do!

1028
01:05:53,940 --> 01:05:56,295
It's getting so anyone thinks
he can walk in!

1029
01:05:56,420 --> 01:06:00,299
Don't you try to get out of this!
That's another one of your gentlemen!

1030
01:06:00,380 --> 01:06:02,530
How can you say such a thing?

1031
01:06:02,900 --> 01:06:04,970
That man's an impostor.

1032
01:06:05,900 --> 01:06:09,813
And if he came here to be buried
in our cellar, he's mistaken.

1033
01:06:11,220 --> 01:06:13,688
You admitted you put Mr. Hoskins
in the windowseat.

1034
01:06:13,780 --> 01:06:14,576
Yes, I did.

1035
01:06:14,660 --> 01:06:17,379
This man couldn't have got the idea
from Mr. Hoskins!

1036
01:06:17,460 --> 01:06:20,896
- By the way, where is Mr. Hoskins?
- He must have gone to Panama.

1037
01:06:21,020 --> 01:06:22,738
- What? You buried him?
- Not yet.

1038
01:06:22,820 --> 01:06:25,698
He's down there
waiting for the services, poor dear.

1039
01:06:25,780 --> 01:06:29,170
We haven't had a minute,
what with Jonathan in the house.

1040
01:06:31,180 --> 01:06:32,056
Oh, dear.

1041
01:06:32,220 --> 01:06:35,690
We've always wanted
to hold a double funeral.

1042
01:06:35,900 --> 01:06:39,529
But I will not read services
over a total stranger!

1043
01:06:40,540 --> 01:06:43,338
A total stranger. How can I believe you?

1044
01:06:43,420 --> 01:06:46,218
There are 12 men down there,
you admit you poisoned them!

1045
01:06:46,300 --> 01:06:50,259
Yes, I did. But you don't think
I'd stoop to telling a fib!

1046
01:06:51,860 --> 01:06:53,816
What do you think has happened?

1047
01:06:54,060 --> 01:06:55,379
"A fib! "

1048
01:07:10,740 --> 01:07:14,938
This may interest you, Mortimer.
I've decided that we're staying.

1049
01:07:15,060 --> 01:07:19,372
And I've also decided that you're leaving,
and I mean now.

1050
01:07:19,540 --> 01:07:22,498
Listen, handsome. I'm in no mood
to debate the question.

1051
01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:25,652
Are you getting out,
or am I throwing you out on your ear?

1052
01:07:25,740 --> 01:07:27,970
I've led a strange life.

1053
01:07:28,740 --> 01:07:30,492
Martha, you come straight along here.

1054
01:07:30,580 --> 01:07:33,333
You just look and see
what's in that windowseat.

1055
01:07:35,220 --> 01:07:36,448
No. Don't...

1056
01:07:59,020 --> 01:08:01,659
Let Aunt Martha see
what's in the windowseat.

1057
01:08:05,540 --> 01:08:08,498
Aunt Abby, darling, I owe you an apology.

1058
01:08:08,700 --> 01:08:11,976
I've got some very good news for you.
Jonathan is leaving.

1059
01:08:13,300 --> 01:08:17,134
And he's taking Dr. Einstein
and that cold companion with him.

1060
01:08:22,420 --> 01:08:25,298
Listen. You're my brother,
you're a Brewster.

1061
01:08:25,380 --> 01:08:28,531
I'll give you a chance to get away
and take the evidence with you.

1062
01:08:28,700 --> 01:08:30,930
You can't ask for more than that.

1063
01:08:31,860 --> 01:08:32,849
Well?

1064
01:08:35,420 --> 01:08:38,412
All right, in that case,
I'll have to call the police.

1065
01:08:40,580 --> 01:08:42,457
Don't reach for the telephone.

1066
01:08:42,580 --> 01:08:46,289
Remember, what happened
to Mr. Spenalzo can happen to you, too.

1067
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:47,774
Spenalzo?

1068
01:08:47,980 --> 01:08:50,255
I knew he was a foreigner.

1069
01:08:50,980 --> 01:08:52,857
Put down that telephone.

1070
01:09:01,620 --> 01:09:02,609
Officer O'Hara!

1071
01:09:02,700 --> 01:09:05,453
I saw the lights and thought
you might have sickness...

1072
01:09:05,540 --> 01:09:07,371
You got company? Sorry I disturbed you.

1073
01:09:07,460 --> 01:09:09,815
- No! Come in.
- Yes, do come in.

1074
01:09:09,900 --> 01:09:12,733
Come right in, Officer.
This is our nephew, Mortimer.

1075
01:09:12,820 --> 01:09:14,697
- Pleased to meet you.
- Glad to see you.

1076
01:09:14,780 --> 01:09:18,409
- And this is another nephew, Jonathan.
- Pleased to make your acquaintance.

1077
01:09:18,780 --> 01:09:21,738
Your face is familiar.
Haven't I seen a picture of you?

1078
01:09:21,820 --> 01:09:23,572
I don't think so.

1079
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:26,697
- I'll be running along.
- Why? Stay until my brother leaves.

1080
01:09:26,780 --> 01:09:28,133
I got to ring in, Mr...

1081
01:09:28,220 --> 01:09:31,292
Are you "the" Mortimer Brewster,
the writer and dramatic critic?

1082
01:09:31,420 --> 01:09:32,216
Yes, why?

1083
01:09:32,300 --> 01:09:36,134
What a break for me! I'm a playwright.
I'm working on a play now.

1084
01:09:36,260 --> 01:09:39,491
You are? Well, well, well!

1085
01:09:39,700 --> 01:09:42,772
- Maybe I can help you with it.
- Would you? What a break!

1086
01:09:42,860 --> 01:09:45,249
I get wonderful ideas,
but I can't spell them.

1087
01:09:45,340 --> 01:09:47,695
I can spell like the dickens.
Constantinople?

1088
01:09:47,780 --> 01:09:50,340
Let's go into the kitchen.
You can tell me all about it.

1089
01:09:50,460 --> 01:09:52,371
Couldn't you whip up a sandwich?

1090
01:09:52,460 --> 01:09:55,691
I hope you don't mind
eating in the kitchen, Officer O'Hara.

1091
01:09:55,820 --> 01:09:57,697
And where else would you eat?

1092
01:09:58,860 --> 01:10:00,339
See you in a moment.

1093
01:10:02,220 --> 01:10:03,733
This is your last chance.

1094
01:10:03,820 --> 01:10:06,380
I'll keep O'Hara busy
to give you a chance to get out.

1095
01:10:06,460 --> 01:10:08,849
All three of you:
you, Dr. Einstein and Spenalzo.

1096
01:10:08,940 --> 01:10:13,218
If you don't leave here, I'll introduce
Officer O'Hara to Mr. Spenalzo.

1097
01:10:13,300 --> 01:10:14,733
My play takes place in...

1098
01:10:14,820 --> 01:10:17,288
I'll be right with you, O'Hara.
Right with you.

1099
01:10:18,460 --> 01:10:20,132
Just give me one moment.

1100
01:10:20,940 --> 01:10:23,374
Now get going! All three of you.

1101
01:10:32,900 --> 01:10:36,097
This affair between my brother and myself
has got to be settled.

1102
01:10:36,180 --> 01:10:39,855
But we've got trouble enough as it is.
Come, let's go.

1103
01:10:40,060 --> 01:10:43,052
We're not going.
We're sleeping right here in this house.

1104
01:10:43,140 --> 01:10:47,019
What? With a cop in the kitchen
and Spenalzo in the windowseat?

1105
01:10:47,220 --> 01:10:50,769
That's all he's got on us. We'll take
Spenalzo and dump him in the bay.

1106
01:10:50,860 --> 01:10:54,250
After that, we're coming back here.
Then if he tries to interfere...

1107
01:10:54,340 --> 01:10:56,092
No, no, Johnny. No, please.

1108
01:10:56,180 --> 01:10:59,217
We've got a wonderful setup here.
We can make a fortune.

1109
01:10:59,420 --> 01:11:03,811
Two old ladies as a front.
Only Mortimer stands in our way.

1110
01:11:04,020 --> 01:11:06,329
I never did like Mortimer.

1111
01:11:06,500 --> 01:11:08,650
Please, take it easy. Please!

1112
01:11:08,860 --> 01:11:10,896
Doctor, you know
when I make up my mind...

1113
01:11:11,020 --> 01:11:13,659
When you make up your mind,
you lose your head.

1114
01:11:13,860 --> 01:11:16,977
Look, Brooklyn ain't a good setup for you.

1115
01:11:18,060 --> 01:11:20,449
Okay, Johnny. Okay!

1116
01:11:21,980 --> 01:11:25,336
Take the instruments and hide them
in the cellar. Move fast.

1117
01:11:27,660 --> 01:11:30,732
- You don't know what goes on in Brooklyn.
- I don't know.

1118
01:11:30,860 --> 01:11:33,579
- My mother was an actress.
- Legitimate?

1119
01:11:33,660 --> 01:11:35,298
Of course. She was my mother.

1120
01:11:35,380 --> 01:11:37,416
- Excuse me.
- Peaches La Tour was her name.

1121
01:11:39,060 --> 01:11:40,857
- Come quick!
- What's the matter?

1122
01:11:40,940 --> 01:11:43,056
- You know that hole in the cellar?
- Yes.

1123
01:11:43,140 --> 01:11:45,529
Well, we got an ace in the hole.

1124
01:11:47,380 --> 01:11:50,178
It's no fly-by-night idea.
I worked on it for 12 years.

1125
01:11:50,580 --> 01:11:52,775
Well, rehash it. I'll be back in a minute.

1126
01:11:52,860 --> 01:11:54,498
- Swell.
- I like the first act.

1127
01:11:54,580 --> 01:11:56,457
I didn't tell you the first...

1128
01:12:03,740 --> 01:12:05,492
I thought I told you...

1129
01:12:10,180 --> 01:12:11,898
Yes, Mortimer.

1130
01:12:14,100 --> 01:12:16,773
What are you doing still here?
I thought I said beat it.

1131
01:12:16,860 --> 01:12:18,054
We're not going.

1132
01:12:18,140 --> 01:12:19,778
- You're not going?
- No.

1133
01:12:19,980 --> 01:12:21,379
You stay out of this.

1134
01:12:21,460 --> 01:12:23,815
All right, you asked for it.

1135
01:12:24,020 --> 01:12:25,612
- Officer O'Hara?
- Coming.

1136
01:12:26,460 --> 01:12:28,849
If you tell O'Hara
what's in the windowseat...

1137
01:12:28,940 --> 01:12:30,931
...I'll tell him what's in the cellar.

1138
01:12:31,020 --> 01:12:31,975
Cellar?

1139
01:12:32,260 --> 01:12:35,855
There's an elderly gentleman down there
who seems to be very dead.

1140
01:12:37,380 --> 01:12:39,974
- What were you doing there?
- What's he doing there?

1141
01:12:40,060 --> 01:12:42,335
Now what are you going to tell O'Hara?

1142
01:12:42,660 --> 01:12:45,891
Your aunts want to hear the rest.
Shall I bring them in here?

1143
01:12:46,020 --> 01:12:48,580
You can't do that now.
You'd better ring in.

1144
01:12:48,780 --> 01:12:51,453
The heck with ringing in!
I want to tell you the plot.

1145
01:12:51,540 --> 01:12:53,895
You can't tell me
in front of those two fellas.

1146
01:12:53,980 --> 01:12:55,015
Lowbrows, huh?

1147
01:12:55,140 --> 01:12:58,450
Let's go where we can be alone.
I'll meet you there later.

1148
01:12:58,580 --> 01:13:00,855
How about the backroom at Kelly's?

1149
01:13:00,980 --> 01:13:03,972
Fine place. Bohemian atmosphere.
Genius at work.

1150
01:13:04,060 --> 01:13:05,971
You ring in and I'll meet you at Kelly's.

1151
01:13:06,100 --> 01:13:08,295
Why don't you both go down in the cellar?

1152
01:13:08,380 --> 01:13:10,211
That's all right with me.

1153
01:13:10,340 --> 01:13:13,491
There's a much more literary atmosphere
in Kelly's, I assure you.

1154
01:13:13,580 --> 01:13:14,854
This opening will kill you.

1155
01:13:14,940 --> 01:13:17,056
I'm waiting to be born and the doctor...

1156
01:13:17,140 --> 01:13:18,289
The doctor!

1157
01:13:18,420 --> 01:13:20,854
Look, you ring in and I'll see you later.

1158
01:13:20,980 --> 01:13:23,858
You won't stand me up, will you?
This is a great play.

1159
01:13:23,940 --> 01:13:25,931
- I'll see you down there.
- Can't wait!

1160
01:13:26,020 --> 01:13:27,214
Doctor, doctor.

1161
01:13:27,380 --> 01:13:29,735
Where are those papers? There they are.

1162
01:13:31,180 --> 01:13:34,855
You're smug, aren't you? You think
you've got it over me. You haven't.

1163
01:13:35,060 --> 01:13:38,894
You think I'm afraid to tell about Spenalzo
because of Hoskins. Well, I'm not!

1164
01:13:38,980 --> 01:13:40,333
The moment I get Spenalzo...

1165
01:13:40,420 --> 01:13:43,651
The moment the doctor signs,
I don't care who knows about Hoskins.

1166
01:13:43,740 --> 01:13:47,016
And you better feel the same way
about Spenalzo. Yes, Spenalzo!

1167
01:13:47,100 --> 01:13:49,898
- Where are you going?
- To the doctor's. Where do you...

1168
01:13:49,980 --> 01:13:52,733
When I come back,
I expect to find you gone. Wait for me!

1169
01:13:53,420 --> 01:13:55,297
We'll wait for him.

1170
01:13:56,300 --> 01:13:57,892
Did he look guilty!

1171
01:13:58,580 --> 01:14:01,731
Well, Martha,
I think we can start the services now.

1172
01:14:03,300 --> 01:14:04,892
We thought we heard you leave.

1173
01:14:04,980 --> 01:14:07,938
Perish the thought, dear aunties.
That was just Mortimer.

1174
01:14:08,020 --> 01:14:09,851
And speaking of services...

1175
01:14:09,980 --> 01:14:14,212
...will you make us some coffee
while we take Spenalzo down to the cellar?

1176
01:14:14,860 --> 01:14:17,420
No, Jonathan.
You've got to take him with you!

1177
01:14:17,540 --> 01:14:20,737
There's a friend of Mortimer's downstairs
waiting for him.

1178
01:14:20,860 --> 01:14:24,011
- A friend of Mortimer's?
- Take his feet, Doctor.

1179
01:14:24,500 --> 01:14:27,219
Mr. Spenalzo and he
will get along fine together.

1180
01:14:27,300 --> 01:14:28,733
They're both dead.

1181
01:14:29,580 --> 01:14:31,252
He must mean Mr. Hoskins.

1182
01:14:31,380 --> 01:14:32,859
Mr. Hoskins?

1183
01:14:37,820 --> 01:14:39,856
You know about what's down there?

1184
01:14:39,980 --> 01:14:43,211
Of course we do.
And he's no friend of Mortimer's.

1185
01:14:43,340 --> 01:14:45,934
- He's one of our gentlemen.
- Your gentlemen?

1186
01:14:46,140 --> 01:14:49,849
Yes. And we won't have
any strangers buried in our cellar.

1187
01:14:50,020 --> 01:14:53,012
- But Mr. Hoskins...
- Mr. Hoskins is no stranger.

1188
01:14:53,140 --> 01:14:55,574
Besides, there's no room for Mr. Spenalzo.

1189
01:14:55,660 --> 01:14:57,491
The cellar's crowded already.

1190
01:14:57,580 --> 01:14:59,013
Crowded? With what?

1191
01:14:59,140 --> 01:15:01,734
There are 12 graves down there now.

1192
01:15:07,740 --> 01:15:09,219
Twelve graves.

1193
01:15:09,300 --> 01:15:12,451
That leaves very little room
and we're going to need it.

1194
01:15:12,780 --> 01:15:15,374
You mean, you and Aunt Martha
have murdered 12...

1195
01:15:15,500 --> 01:15:18,617
Murdered? Certainly not.
It's one of our charities.

1196
01:15:18,700 --> 01:15:21,419
Why, what we've been doing is a mercy.

1197
01:15:21,540 --> 01:15:25,692
So you just take your Mr. Spenalzo
out of here.

1198
01:15:30,420 --> 01:15:32,456
You've done all that...

1199
01:15:32,940 --> 01:15:36,774
...right here in this house
and buried them in the cellar?

1200
01:15:38,140 --> 01:15:40,574
That's wonderful, Johnny!

1201
01:15:40,860 --> 01:15:43,090
We've been chased all over the world...

1202
01:15:43,180 --> 01:15:47,139
...and they stay right here in Brooklyn,
and they do just as good as you do.

1203
01:15:47,260 --> 01:15:48,295
What?

1204
01:15:49,660 --> 01:15:51,810
You got 12, they got 12.

1205
01:15:52,300 --> 01:15:53,415
I've got 13.

1206
01:15:53,620 --> 01:15:56,817
- No, Johnny, 12. Don't brag.
- Thirteen.

1207
01:15:57,060 --> 01:16:00,496
There's Mr. Spenalzo.
Then the first one in London.

1208
01:16:00,700 --> 01:16:03,498
Two in Johannesburg, one in Sydney,
one in Melbourne...

1209
01:16:03,580 --> 01:16:06,219
...two in San Francisco,
one in Phoenix, Arizona.

1210
01:16:06,300 --> 01:16:07,289
Phoenix?

1211
01:16:07,540 --> 01:16:09,929
- The filling station.
- Filling...

1212
01:16:10,060 --> 01:16:12,893
Three in Chicago and one in South Bend.

1213
01:16:13,100 --> 01:16:14,374
That makes 13.

1214
01:16:14,460 --> 01:16:17,770
You cannot count the one in South Bend.
He died of pneumonia.

1215
01:16:17,860 --> 01:16:20,693
He wouldn't have died of pneumonia
if I hadn't shot him.

1216
01:16:20,780 --> 01:16:22,771
You cannot count him.

1217
01:16:23,100 --> 01:16:25,455
You got 12, they got 12.

1218
01:16:25,580 --> 01:16:28,890
The old ladies is just as good as you are.

1219
01:16:31,660 --> 01:16:33,651
They are, are they?

1220
01:16:34,700 --> 01:16:37,134
Well, that's easily taken care of.

1221
01:16:37,340 --> 01:16:39,774
All I need is one more.

1222
01:16:39,980 --> 01:16:42,733
That's all. Just one more.

1223
01:16:44,020 --> 01:16:47,490
And I've a pretty good idea who it is.

1224
01:16:48,100 --> 01:16:51,217
I'm a lucky man to have caught you
at home, Dr. Gilchrist.

1225
01:16:51,300 --> 01:16:52,972
This is most irregular.

1226
01:16:53,100 --> 01:16:56,695
I'm sorry to have dragged you out of bed,
but only you can help me.

1227
01:16:56,780 --> 01:17:00,329
I know Teddy blows bugles,
but I can't commit a man just on that.

1228
01:17:00,460 --> 01:17:01,813
If you'd talk with him...

1229
01:17:01,900 --> 01:17:04,698
...I'm sure you'd be convinced.
Here's the house I...

1230
01:17:07,180 --> 01:17:08,932
- There goes Hoskins.
- Who?

1231
01:17:09,060 --> 01:17:10,937
What? Did I say...

1232
01:17:12,940 --> 01:17:14,373
- You better wait.
- Here?

1233
01:17:14,460 --> 01:17:15,688
I'll bring Teddy out.

1234
01:17:15,780 --> 01:17:18,658
I wouldn't want to alarm the old ladies,
seeing a doctor.

1235
01:17:18,740 --> 01:17:20,890
- You wait here.
- In the cemetery?

1236
01:17:21,100 --> 01:17:22,294
It's Halloween.

1237
01:17:22,380 --> 01:17:24,655
The pixies won't be out till after midnight.

1238
01:17:24,740 --> 01:17:28,415
Make yourself comfortable.
Pull up a tombstone. I'll be right back.

1239
01:17:28,940 --> 01:17:30,498
- Hey, $22.50!
- What?

1240
01:17:30,620 --> 01:17:31,609
$22.50!

1241
01:17:31,740 --> 01:17:33,935
Oh, yes, looks good on you!

1242
01:17:34,580 --> 01:17:36,332
Not the suit, the meter!

1243
01:17:37,700 --> 01:17:40,498
"Looks good on me".
$22.50.

1244
01:17:44,420 --> 01:17:47,492
- Did you give him a 21-gun salute?
- Yes, with a Maxim silencer.

1245
01:17:47,580 --> 01:17:49,616
Five more bucks and you'll own it.

1246
01:17:49,700 --> 01:17:51,895
No, thanks. It wouldn't fit me.

1247
01:17:53,660 --> 01:17:56,572
- Mr. President, may I present...
- Dr. Livingstone!

1248
01:17:56,660 --> 01:17:59,697
- Livingstone?
- That's what he presumes.

1249
01:17:59,820 --> 01:18:02,539
The doctor would like
to have a few words with you.

1250
01:18:02,620 --> 01:18:05,498
Certainly. Welcome to Washington.

1251
01:18:05,660 --> 01:18:08,413
Arlington is beautiful
at this time of year, is it not?

1252
01:18:08,500 --> 01:18:09,853
Yes, indeed.

1253
01:18:14,940 --> 01:18:17,215
Well now, that's that.

1254
01:18:17,420 --> 01:18:19,411
It gives me a chance to rest.

1255
01:18:23,140 --> 01:18:24,459
So far, so good.

1256
01:18:27,180 --> 01:18:28,454
Not so good.

1257
01:18:34,340 --> 01:18:36,251
Do you or do you not love me?

1258
01:18:38,060 --> 01:18:41,575
How can you say such a thing?
Darling, of course I love you.

1259
01:18:41,660 --> 01:18:43,332
- Do you?
- Yes, darling.

1260
01:18:43,460 --> 01:18:46,816
Then why have you been treating me
the way you have?

1261
01:18:49,740 --> 01:18:53,574
Darling, I love you so much,
I can't go through with our marriage.

1262
01:18:55,860 --> 01:18:57,418
Have you suddenly gone crazy?

1263
01:18:57,500 --> 01:19:00,219
I don't think so,
but it's only a matter of time.

1264
01:19:00,300 --> 01:19:03,815
Darling, would you want to have children
with three heads?

1265
01:19:03,900 --> 01:19:07,779
You wouldn't want to set up housekeeping
in a padded cell.

1266
01:19:07,940 --> 01:19:10,977
- What are you talking about?
- Well, I don't quite know.

1267
01:19:11,180 --> 01:19:14,490
I probably should have told you this before,
but you see...

1268
01:19:14,580 --> 01:19:17,731
...well, insanity runs in my family.

1269
01:19:18,820 --> 01:19:20,811
It practically gallops.

1270
01:19:22,620 --> 01:19:25,134
Just because Teddy's strange,
that doesn't mean...

1271
01:19:25,220 --> 01:19:27,654
No, darling. It's way back before Teddy.

1272
01:19:27,860 --> 01:19:31,535
This goes back to the first Brewster
who came over on the Mayflower.

1273
01:19:31,820 --> 01:19:35,654
You know how in those days
the Indians used to scalp the settlers?

1274
01:19:36,100 --> 01:19:38,136
He used to scalp the Indians.

1275
01:19:38,980 --> 01:19:40,732
Darling, that's ancient history.

1276
01:19:40,820 --> 01:19:44,290
Doctor, I'll run for a third term,
but I won't be elected.

1277
01:19:44,380 --> 01:19:47,213
That'll mean the last of the Roosevelts
in the White House.

1278
01:19:47,300 --> 01:19:50,656
- That's what you think.
- Of course, if the country insists...

1279
01:19:50,740 --> 01:19:52,935
Darling, all this doesn't prove a thing.

1280
01:19:53,020 --> 01:19:55,898
Look at your aunts.
They're Brewsters, aren't they?

1281
01:19:55,980 --> 01:19:58,653
They're the sweetest,
sanest people I've ever known.

1282
01:20:01,060 --> 01:20:03,858
Well, even they have their peculiarities.

1283
01:20:03,940 --> 01:20:06,818
What of it? So your family's crazy.
So you're crazy.

1284
01:20:06,900 --> 01:20:08,697
That's the way I love you.

1285
01:20:09,060 --> 01:20:11,369
I'm crazy too, but kiss me.

1286
01:20:11,700 --> 01:20:13,258
No, no. I...

1287
01:20:16,820 --> 01:20:20,096
Goodbye, Ambassador.
I've enjoyed this little talk very much.

1288
01:20:20,180 --> 01:20:23,570
Anytime you're in Washington,
drop in to see me at the White House.

1289
01:20:29,340 --> 01:20:32,013
- Those papers.
- Go away. Papers!

1290
01:20:32,180 --> 01:20:34,614
- I'll commit him to any place.
- You will?

1291
01:20:34,700 --> 01:20:36,930
I've just been appointed
Ambassador to Bolivia!

1292
01:20:37,020 --> 01:20:39,614
You see? Didn't I tell you?

1293
01:20:39,700 --> 01:20:42,772
Don't worry about that.
Just go on signing the papers.

1294
01:20:43,820 --> 01:20:44,889
Thank you.

1295
01:20:47,060 --> 01:20:50,735
All right! We'll find out
whose house this is!

1296
01:20:50,860 --> 01:20:53,454
I'm warning you, you better stop it.

1297
01:20:53,540 --> 01:20:56,976
There's no use doing what you're doing.
It'll just have to be undone.

1298
01:20:57,060 --> 01:20:58,698
Aunt Abby, go to bed!

1299
01:20:58,820 --> 01:21:02,733
It's a terrible thing to do to bury
a good Methodist with a foreigner.

1300
01:21:02,820 --> 01:21:04,219
Where have you been?

1301
01:21:04,300 --> 01:21:06,860
Getting some papers signed.
Is Teddy in his room?

1302
01:21:06,940 --> 01:21:08,658
What is the matter with you?

1303
01:21:08,740 --> 01:21:11,652
Running around getting papers signed
at a time like this.

1304
01:21:11,740 --> 01:21:13,856
Martha and I are going for the police.

1305
01:21:13,940 --> 01:21:14,895
Police!

1306
01:21:15,620 --> 01:21:16,769
Wait!

1307
01:21:16,860 --> 01:21:19,169
- You can't go for the police.
- Oh, no?

1308
01:21:19,300 --> 01:21:20,972
You know what Jonathan's doing?

1309
01:21:21,060 --> 01:21:23,938
He's putting Mr. Hoskins
and Mr. Spenalzo in together.

1310
01:21:24,020 --> 01:21:25,248
All right, let him.

1311
01:21:25,340 --> 01:21:27,979
This is all fixed up nice now.

1312
01:21:28,180 --> 01:21:30,535
Nice and smooth like a lake.

1313
01:21:30,700 --> 01:21:34,693
The President will be very proud
of his Panama Canal.

1314
01:21:36,660 --> 01:21:38,616
Bed feels good already.

1315
01:21:38,700 --> 01:21:42,249
You know, we didn't get any sleep
for 48 hours.

1316
01:21:42,380 --> 01:21:44,098
You're forgetting, Doctor.

1317
01:21:45,340 --> 01:21:48,616
If Jonathan and Mr. Spenalzo
aren't out this house before morning...

1318
01:21:48,700 --> 01:21:50,452
...we're going for the police.

1319
01:21:50,540 --> 01:21:52,178
I'll get them out, I promise!

1320
01:21:52,260 --> 01:21:56,173
- Then you get the wedding silver.
- Remember, no police! No police!

1321
01:21:56,660 --> 01:21:58,571
Look, go to bed, will you?

1322
01:21:58,700 --> 01:22:02,170
Get out of those clothes!
You look like a double blackout.

1323
01:22:02,340 --> 01:22:04,695
My brother, Mortimer.

1324
01:22:04,980 --> 01:22:06,698
I just heard him upstairs.

1325
01:22:07,340 --> 01:22:09,774
No! I am tired.

1326
01:22:09,860 --> 01:22:14,138
You forget, I got to operate
on your face tomorrow.

1327
01:22:14,340 --> 01:22:17,138
You are going to operate tomorrow,
Doctor.

1328
01:22:17,300 --> 01:22:19,973
But tonight we are taking care
of Mortimer.

1329
01:22:20,100 --> 01:22:23,137
But Johnny, not tonight! I'm sleepy.

1330
01:22:23,220 --> 01:22:25,654
We'll do it tomorrow. Or the next day.

1331
01:22:26,020 --> 01:22:27,931
Look at me, Doctor.

1332
01:22:28,780 --> 01:22:32,489
You can see that it's got to be done,
can't you?

1333
01:22:32,740 --> 01:22:36,210
Yeah, I know that look.

1334
01:22:36,420 --> 01:22:39,696
It's a little late to dissolve our partnership.

1335
01:22:39,900 --> 01:22:42,289
Okay, Johnny. Okay, we'll do it.

1336
01:22:42,420 --> 01:22:45,617
But the quick way, huh?
The quick twist like in London.

1337
01:22:45,820 --> 01:22:49,779
No, Doctor. I think this calls
for something special.

1338
01:22:50,460 --> 01:22:53,850
I think, perhaps, the Melbourne method.

1339
01:22:54,020 --> 01:22:56,693
Not the Melbourne method, please!

1340
01:22:56,820 --> 01:22:58,492
Two hours!

1341
01:22:58,660 --> 01:23:01,015
And then when it was all over, what?

1342
01:23:01,220 --> 01:23:04,974
The fellow in London was just as dead
as the fellow in Melbourne.

1343
01:23:06,700 --> 01:23:08,292
Don't do that, Mr. President.

1344
01:23:08,380 --> 01:23:11,258
But I cannot sign anything
without consulting my Cabinet.

1345
01:23:11,340 --> 01:23:12,568
This must be secret.

1346
01:23:12,660 --> 01:23:15,299
A secret proclamation? How unusual.

1347
01:23:15,500 --> 01:23:18,333
Yes, it's the only way
we can outsmart the other fellow.

1348
01:23:18,420 --> 01:23:20,650
- Who's the other fellow?
- That's the secret.

1349
01:23:20,740 --> 01:23:22,492
Oh, I see!

1350
01:23:23,020 --> 01:23:24,248
Very clever.

1351
01:23:24,580 --> 01:23:27,094
A secret proclamation
has to be signed in secret.

1352
01:23:27,180 --> 01:23:30,138
- Of course, Mr. President.
- I'll put on my signing clothes.

1353
01:23:30,220 --> 01:23:32,336
You already have them on, Mr. President.

1354
01:23:32,420 --> 01:23:34,650
So I have. Wait here.

1355
01:23:37,980 --> 01:23:39,936
Hey, Mr. Brewster.

1356
01:23:40,060 --> 01:23:41,573
What is it, mice?

1357
01:23:44,660 --> 01:23:47,572
- You get out of this house.
- Can't you see I'm busy?

1358
01:23:56,220 --> 01:23:57,892
Thank you, Mr. President.

1359
01:23:58,460 --> 01:24:01,099
What a load off my mind.
Boy, could I use a drink!

1360
01:24:01,180 --> 01:24:04,729
- Get out of here, will you, please?
- What? Speak up. I can't hear you.

1361
01:24:04,820 --> 01:24:06,617
Johnny's in a bad mood. Get out!

1362
01:24:06,700 --> 01:24:10,056
- Stop underplaying. I can't hear you.
- Please listen to me. Get out.

1363
01:24:10,140 --> 01:24:13,735
Stop all this! What are you doing?
Look, Doc... Are you really a doctor?

1364
01:24:13,820 --> 01:24:15,617
Yes, Heidelberg, 1919.

1365
01:24:15,740 --> 01:24:18,300
Heidelberg?
How'd you hook up with Jonathan?

1366
01:24:18,420 --> 01:24:22,299
I tell you later about that, but you go now.
Please listen to me.

1367
01:24:23,260 --> 01:24:24,579
Stop it, Doctor!

1368
01:24:24,660 --> 01:24:27,538
You get out of here!
Look, when Johnny's in that mood...

1369
01:24:27,620 --> 01:24:29,815
...he's a madman. He's a maniac!

1370
01:24:30,020 --> 01:24:32,978
And then things happen. Horrible things.

1371
01:24:33,060 --> 01:24:35,255
- Get out of here!
- Will you stop it?

1372
01:24:35,340 --> 01:24:37,934
Stop telling me about Jonathan,
I'll take care of him.

1373
01:24:38,020 --> 01:24:40,818
You take care of yourself.
Get going, little fellow.

1374
01:24:40,900 --> 01:24:42,936
- What's that? Wait.
- My schnapps.

1375
01:24:43,020 --> 01:24:45,488
- I could use that.
- That's mine.

1376
01:24:46,660 --> 01:24:48,730
Please. Only for dramatic critics.

1377
01:24:48,820 --> 01:24:51,539
You beat it before things start popping
around here.

1378
01:24:51,620 --> 01:24:53,690
But, look, Mr. Brewster, please.

1379
01:24:53,780 --> 01:24:55,338
You've just been married.

1380
01:24:55,420 --> 01:24:58,810
You have a nice little wife waiting for you.
Please go now.

1381
01:24:59,060 --> 01:25:00,254
Please.

1382
01:25:04,300 --> 01:25:06,973
Don't those plays you see all the time
teach you anything?

1383
01:25:07,260 --> 01:25:10,809
Don't get me on the subject of plays!
I've got to wait for Mr. Witherspoon.

1384
01:25:10,900 --> 01:25:13,334
At least people in plays
act like they got sense.

1385
01:25:13,420 --> 01:25:16,218
Did anybody in a play
ever act like they got intelligence?

1386
01:25:16,300 --> 01:25:19,451
- How can somebody be so stupid?
- You ought to have my job.

1387
01:25:19,580 --> 01:25:23,539
When you get out of prison, have yourself
wheeled to the Garrick Theater.

1388
01:25:23,860 --> 01:25:27,170
There's a play that's so bad,
it'll still be running when you get out.

1389
01:25:27,260 --> 01:25:29,057
There's a man... Now listen to this.

1390
01:25:29,140 --> 01:25:32,576
He knows he's in the house with murderers
and should know he's in danger.

1391
01:25:32,660 --> 01:25:35,049
He's even been warned to get out.
And does he go?

1392
01:25:35,140 --> 01:25:36,858
No, he doesn't. He stays!

1393
01:25:37,140 --> 01:25:41,531
This fellow doesn't even have sense
to be scared or to be on his guard.

1394
01:25:41,740 --> 01:25:43,696
The murderer even invites him to sit down.

1395
01:25:43,780 --> 01:25:45,691
- What do you think he does?
- I don't know.

1396
01:25:45,780 --> 01:25:47,418
He sits down!

1397
01:25:47,500 --> 01:25:50,617
He deliberately pulls up a chair
and he sits down in it.

1398
01:25:50,740 --> 01:25:52,173
Isn't that great?

1399
01:25:53,020 --> 01:25:56,330
So there he is,
all waiting to be trussed up and gagged.

1400
01:25:57,100 --> 01:26:00,888
What do you think they tied him up with?
The curtain cord.

1401
01:26:01,980 --> 01:26:03,254
Curtain cord?

1402
01:26:03,740 --> 01:26:05,617
But didn't he see him get it?

1403
01:26:05,700 --> 01:26:08,772
No. The silly chump sits down
with his back toward the murderer.

1404
01:26:08,860 --> 01:26:11,658
All he has to do is look around,
but does he? No!

1405
01:26:13,020 --> 01:26:16,456
See, brother Heidelberg,
in a play or even in a movie...

1406
01:26:16,700 --> 01:26:20,249
...a fellow never sees or hears anything.
That's right.

1407
01:26:20,340 --> 01:26:21,773
But what does he do?

1408
01:26:22,020 --> 01:26:25,649
The big chump sits there.
This fellow's supposed to be bright.

1409
01:26:25,740 --> 01:26:28,891
Now get a load of this.
Look at the attitude.

1410
01:26:29,220 --> 01:26:32,849
Large as life! He sits there
waiting to be tied up and gagged.

1411
01:26:33,420 --> 01:26:34,739
The big dope!

1412
01:26:43,500 --> 01:26:47,209
You were right about that fellow.
He wasn't very bright.

1413
01:26:48,420 --> 01:26:49,853
Yes, Mortimer.

1414
01:26:50,900 --> 01:26:53,414
I've been away for 20 years.

1415
01:26:53,700 --> 01:26:56,851
But never, my dear brother,
were you out of my mind.

1416
01:26:59,220 --> 01:27:02,451
In Melbourne one night, I dreamt of you.

1417
01:27:24,300 --> 01:27:28,009
The more you struggle
the more you strangle yourself.

1418
01:27:30,700 --> 01:27:33,373
Later on, you may consider that a blessing.

1419
01:28:05,620 --> 01:28:06,814
Now, Doctor...

1420
01:28:08,620 --> 01:28:10,133
...we go to work.

1421
01:28:10,220 --> 01:28:12,575
Johnny, for me, the quick way. Please.

1422
01:28:13,620 --> 01:28:16,373
- This must be an artistic achievement.
- Please.

1423
01:28:16,580 --> 01:28:20,129
After all, we're performing
before a very distinguished critic.

1424
01:28:20,980 --> 01:28:22,015
Please!

1425
01:28:22,780 --> 01:28:26,090
All right. Let's get it over with.

1426
01:28:26,980 --> 01:28:30,370
But I cannot see this without the drink.

1427
01:28:31,420 --> 01:28:32,819
Pull yourself together.

1428
01:28:32,900 --> 01:28:36,688
But I can't pull myself together
without a drink.

1429
01:28:36,780 --> 01:28:39,613
You remember when we came in,
there was some wine.

1430
01:28:39,700 --> 01:28:42,533
And then they took it.
Where did they put it?

1431
01:28:43,940 --> 01:28:45,851
I found some wine.

1432
01:28:47,300 --> 01:28:49,291
Here, I'll split it with you.

1433
01:28:49,380 --> 01:28:51,974
We both have a drink before we operate.

1434
01:28:52,220 --> 01:28:56,611
I am so happy that we don't have
to operate without a drink.

1435
01:29:03,140 --> 01:29:04,539
One moment, please.

1436
01:29:05,380 --> 01:29:07,177
Where are your manners?

1437
01:29:09,820 --> 01:29:11,299
Yes, Mortimer.

1438
01:29:11,540 --> 01:29:15,419
I realize now that it was you
who brought me back to Brooklyn.

1439
01:29:15,500 --> 01:29:16,899
We drink to you.

1440
01:29:18,220 --> 01:29:20,131
To my dear, dead brother.

1441
01:29:37,220 --> 01:29:38,255
That idiot!

1442
01:29:38,340 --> 01:29:41,855
- He goes next. That's all. He goes next!
- Not Teddy! Please!

1443
01:29:41,980 --> 01:29:44,494
- We'll get to him later.
- You won't at all!

1444
01:29:44,660 --> 01:29:46,537
We have to work fast. The quick way.

1445
01:29:46,620 --> 01:29:48,133
The quick way, yes!

1446
01:29:48,220 --> 01:29:51,451
If it has to be, then the quick way.
I'll help you.

1447
01:30:05,620 --> 01:30:07,736
The colonel has to quit blowing that horn.

1448
01:30:07,820 --> 01:30:10,778
It's all right. We're taking
the bugle away from him.

1449
01:30:10,860 --> 01:30:13,818
I'd better talk to him myself.
Where's the lights?

1450
01:30:20,020 --> 01:30:21,692
You stood me up!

1451
01:30:22,260 --> 01:30:25,172
I've been waiting for you
for over an hour at Kelly's.

1452
01:30:26,140 --> 01:30:28,096
- What happened to him?
- Nothing.

1453
01:30:28,260 --> 01:30:33,254
He was explaining a play he saw and
that's what happened to a man in the play.

1454
01:30:33,940 --> 01:30:34,850
I see.

1455
01:30:35,380 --> 01:30:37,450
Did that really happen in a play you saw?

1456
01:30:37,820 --> 01:30:40,129
How do you like that?
You can't trust nobody.

1457
01:30:40,220 --> 01:30:42,654
They practically stole that from my play.

1458
01:30:42,980 --> 01:30:46,689
In the second act, just...
Maybe I'd better start at the beginning.

1459
01:30:48,660 --> 01:30:50,013
Yeah, sure.

1460
01:30:55,620 --> 01:30:58,088
You've got to hear the plot!

1461
01:31:01,220 --> 01:31:04,929
My mother's making up.
Like a flash, out of a clear sky...

1462
01:31:05,060 --> 01:31:07,654
...the door opens and a man
with a mustache comes in.

1463
01:31:07,740 --> 01:31:11,369
He says, "Miss Peaches La Tour,
will you marry me?"

1464
01:31:12,220 --> 01:31:16,930
That's the first scene. My mother doesn't
say they're married. That's the surprise!

1465
01:31:17,060 --> 01:31:18,334
What a kick!

1466
01:31:18,780 --> 01:31:22,250
Twenty-five years pass.
Well, in the meantime, there's me.

1467
01:31:22,420 --> 01:31:25,776
Growing into a magnificent specimen.
So what do I do?

1468
01:31:25,860 --> 01:31:29,057
I join the police force and become
one of New York's finest.

1469
01:31:29,140 --> 01:31:32,576
I'm cleaning out a crooked laundry, see?
Little do I know it...

1470
01:31:32,700 --> 01:31:35,089
...but a dope fiend with a knife is after me.

1471
01:31:35,180 --> 01:31:36,659
I'm in great danger.

1472
01:31:38,020 --> 01:31:41,012
It's getting you, ain't it?
I can see it in your eyes.

1473
01:31:42,460 --> 01:31:44,257
You ain't heard nothing yet.

1474
01:31:44,380 --> 01:31:47,452
All of a sudden, a fire breaks out.
What an effect!

1475
01:31:47,540 --> 01:31:49,849
Firemen rush in and who's leading them?

1476
01:31:50,100 --> 01:31:52,136
Mayor Fiorello La Guardia!

1477
01:31:54,820 --> 01:31:56,299
What's the matter with him?

1478
01:31:56,380 --> 01:31:58,974
- Probably your play put him to sleep.
- What?

1479
01:31:59,060 --> 01:32:02,973
- I personally like it very much.
- It's probably over his head.

1480
01:32:03,300 --> 01:32:06,178
- Where have I seen that face before?
- No, please.

1481
01:32:08,300 --> 01:32:11,212
The scene changes. It's an evolving stage.

1482
01:32:11,460 --> 01:32:13,655
I'm walking along my beat, casual-like...

1483
01:32:13,740 --> 01:32:17,289
...when a guy that I'm following,
it turns out he's following me!

1484
01:32:17,620 --> 01:32:20,373
Don't let nobody in.
I figures I'll outsmart him.

1485
01:32:20,500 --> 01:32:23,810
- There's a vacant house on the corner.
- Johnny, the cops!

1486
01:32:23,900 --> 01:32:26,619
I sees the door handle turn,
so I pulls out my gun...

1487
01:32:26,700 --> 01:32:29,055
...braces myself against the wall and I says:

1488
01:32:29,140 --> 01:32:30,129
"Come in! "

1489
01:32:34,100 --> 01:32:35,499
Hello, boys.

1490
01:32:35,940 --> 01:32:39,535
- What the Sam Hill's going on?
- Sarge, this is Mortimer Brewster.

1491
01:32:39,620 --> 01:32:42,817
- He's going to help me write my play.
- Do you have to tie him up?

1492
01:32:42,900 --> 01:32:46,734
Report in. Why didn't you ring in?
The whole force is out looking for you.

1493
01:32:46,820 --> 01:32:49,812
Right in the middle of the second act.
Did they send you here?

1494
01:32:49,900 --> 01:32:52,255
No, we came to warn the old ladies.

1495
01:32:52,340 --> 01:32:54,695
- The colonel blew that bugle again.
- I heard him.

1496
01:32:54,780 --> 01:32:57,613
The neighbors are phoning in.
The Lieutenant's on the warpath.

1497
01:32:57,700 --> 01:32:59,975
He says we've got
to put him away someplace.

1498
01:33:00,300 --> 01:33:01,779
Now, who the heck is this?

1499
01:33:01,860 --> 01:33:04,533
Mr. Brewster's brother.
My play put him to sleep.

1500
01:33:04,620 --> 01:33:07,532
That's the one that ran away.
So he came back.

1501
01:33:07,780 --> 01:33:09,259
Brophy. Get me Mac.

1502
01:33:09,420 --> 01:33:12,856
Have you got yourself in a mess!
You're two hours overdue at the station.

1503
01:33:13,140 --> 01:33:15,335
I better let them know that I found you.

1504
01:33:15,420 --> 01:33:17,138
It wasn't that bad, was it?

1505
01:33:18,420 --> 01:33:22,299
Tell the Lieutenant he can call off
the big manhunt. We found him.

1506
01:33:22,580 --> 01:33:24,969
At the Brewster house.

1507
01:33:25,060 --> 01:33:27,176
Shall we bring him in?

1508
01:33:27,380 --> 01:33:29,610
All right, we'll hold him right here.

1509
01:33:31,260 --> 01:33:33,728
The Lieutenant is on his way over.

1510
01:33:34,140 --> 01:33:36,654
So I've been turned in?

1511
01:33:37,220 --> 01:33:39,780
All right, you've got me.

1512
01:33:40,620 --> 01:33:44,659
I suppose you and my stool-pigeon brother
will split the reward.

1513
01:33:44,780 --> 01:33:45,895
Yes, reward!

1514
01:33:45,980 --> 01:33:47,811
Now I'll do some turning in!

1515
01:33:47,940 --> 01:33:49,532
Wait a minute, Mr. Brewster.

1516
01:33:49,620 --> 01:33:53,010
You think my aunts are sweet,
charming old ladies, don't you?

1517
01:33:53,100 --> 01:33:56,251
Well, there's 13 bodies buried in the cellar!

1518
01:33:56,740 --> 01:33:57,695
Yes, 13.

1519
01:33:57,780 --> 01:34:00,533
Be careful what you say.
Your aunts are friends of ours.

1520
01:34:00,620 --> 01:34:03,532
- I'll show them to you.
- Don't make trouble for them!

1521
01:34:03,620 --> 01:34:06,054
Never mind, Mr. Brewster.
Leave him to me.

1522
01:34:06,140 --> 01:34:08,210
- Come down to the cellar.
- Wait a minute.

1523
01:34:08,300 --> 01:34:11,053
Thirteen bodies.
I'll show you where they're buried.

1524
01:34:11,660 --> 01:34:14,094
- Go to the cellar with him.
- Yes, come to the cellar.

1525
01:34:14,180 --> 01:34:15,818
Well, look, do I have to?

1526
01:34:16,940 --> 01:34:19,170
Maybe I don't want to go down
to the cellar.

1527
01:34:19,260 --> 01:34:21,296
Go on down the cellar with him!

1528
01:34:21,380 --> 01:34:24,611
Now, please. I'll tell you
the rest of my play later.

1529
01:34:25,180 --> 01:34:27,819
- Go on down the cellar with him.
- Do I have to?

1530
01:34:27,940 --> 01:34:30,408
Look at that puss.
He looks like Boris Karloff.

1531
01:34:30,500 --> 01:34:31,694
Don't! Sarge!

1532
01:34:38,300 --> 01:34:39,619
Look out, Pat!

1533
01:34:44,660 --> 01:34:46,616
- Look out!
- He's got a gun.

1534
01:34:47,220 --> 01:34:49,495
I got him, Pat. Look out!

1535
01:34:49,860 --> 01:34:51,737
Fight. Go on and fight.

1536
01:34:56,260 --> 01:34:59,138
That's enough, that's enough.
Everybody off.

1537
01:35:02,340 --> 01:35:03,409
Pat, look out!

1538
01:35:03,500 --> 01:35:04,615
Amazing.

1539
01:35:10,220 --> 01:35:12,529
Such a fine day, too.

1540
01:35:12,620 --> 01:35:16,454
All I did was cross the bridge
and I was in Brooklyn. Amazing.

1541
01:35:22,020 --> 01:35:23,339
Don't bother me now.

1542
01:35:23,420 --> 01:35:25,376
You could use this in the third act.

1543
01:35:25,460 --> 01:35:27,928
I got something better. Let me tell you...

1544
01:35:28,580 --> 01:35:29,979
I'll see you later.

1545
01:35:33,500 --> 01:35:36,298
The papers are all signed. What do I care?

1546
01:35:36,620 --> 01:35:38,099
Go ahead, fight.

1547
01:35:44,460 --> 01:35:47,213
I'd better call and see
if Witherspoon has left.

1548
01:35:48,220 --> 01:35:49,289
Telephone.

1549
01:35:50,380 --> 01:35:51,938
I'll get every one of you!

1550
01:35:52,020 --> 01:35:55,012
I hate cops. I'll brain the first one
that comes near me!

1551
01:35:55,100 --> 01:35:58,137
A little higher, brother.
Thank you very much. That's fine.

1552
01:35:58,780 --> 01:36:00,133
Don't do that, please.

1553
01:36:00,220 --> 01:36:01,414
Get him, Pat.

1554
01:36:01,860 --> 01:36:04,499
That won't have any effect.
I've tried it before...

1555
01:36:04,580 --> 01:36:05,854
It did. Isn't that amazing?

1556
01:36:08,300 --> 01:36:11,019
Oh, dear. Wish I could relax like that.

1557
01:36:12,740 --> 01:36:14,298
- Witherspoon.
- Come in.

1558
01:36:28,220 --> 01:36:29,858
What has occurred?

1559
01:36:29,940 --> 01:36:32,534
Never mind!
Didn't I tell you I'd handle this?

1560
01:36:32,780 --> 01:36:34,008
Well, Lieutenant!

1561
01:36:34,100 --> 01:36:37,695
- We were just acting in self-defense.
- What happened? He put up a fight?

1562
01:36:37,780 --> 01:36:40,010
This isn't the one who blows the bugle.

1563
01:36:40,100 --> 01:36:44,537
- This is his brother who tried to kill O'Hara.
- All I said was he looked like Boris Karloff.

1564
01:36:44,620 --> 01:36:46,497
Boris... Turn him over.

1565
01:36:50,180 --> 01:36:52,535
Kind of think he's wanted somewhere.

1566
01:36:52,820 --> 01:36:55,288
You "kind of think
he's wanted somewhere"?

1567
01:36:55,540 --> 01:36:58,577
If you guys can't look
at the circulars we put up...

1568
01:36:58,820 --> 01:37:01,129
...you can at least read
short detective stories.

1569
01:37:01,220 --> 01:37:03,211
Certainly, he's wanted. In Indiana!

1570
01:37:03,300 --> 01:37:06,610
He escaped from the prison
for criminally insane. He's a lifer.

1571
01:37:06,700 --> 01:37:07,894
That's my brother.

1572
01:37:07,980 --> 01:37:11,814
That's the way they described him.
"He looked like Karloff".

1573
01:37:12,300 --> 01:37:13,653
Why'd you knock him out?

1574
01:37:13,740 --> 01:37:16,971
He tried to get us to go to the cellar.
He says 13 bodies are there.

1575
01:37:17,060 --> 01:37:18,493
Thirteen bodies in the cellar...

1576
01:37:18,580 --> 01:37:21,572
...and that don't tip you off
the guy's from a nuthouse?

1577
01:37:21,660 --> 01:37:22,809
Thanks, pal.

1578
01:37:22,940 --> 01:37:24,737
About my not ringing in, I want to...

1579
01:37:24,820 --> 01:37:27,254
Where have you been all night?
Don't tell me.

1580
01:37:27,340 --> 01:37:30,730
I was right here writing a play
with Mortimer Brewster.

1581
01:37:30,860 --> 01:37:33,579
You're going to have
a long time on that play.

1582
01:37:33,740 --> 01:37:35,173
You're suspended.

1583
01:37:35,260 --> 01:37:36,898
Now go on. Report in.

1584
01:37:36,980 --> 01:37:39,972
Bring him to and find out
where his accomplice is.

1585
01:37:40,060 --> 01:37:42,449
The guy who helped him escape.
He's wanted, too.

1586
01:37:42,540 --> 01:37:43,529
Here.

1587
01:37:43,820 --> 01:37:46,971
I've been after these guys for 48 hours.
Nothing to eat. No sleep.

1588
01:37:47,140 --> 01:37:49,017
No wonder Brooklyn's in the shape it's in.

1589
01:37:49,100 --> 01:37:52,490
With flatheads like you on the force.
Falling for a story like that!

1590
01:37:52,580 --> 01:37:54,616
Thirteen bodies buried in the cellar.

1591
01:37:54,780 --> 01:37:57,055
But there are 13 bodies in the cellar!

1592
01:37:58,020 --> 01:38:00,488
- Who are you?
- I'm President Roosevelt.

1593
01:38:02,180 --> 01:38:05,650
- What the blazes is this?
- He's the one that blows the bugle.

1594
01:38:05,940 --> 01:38:07,453
Howdy, Colonel.

1595
01:38:11,020 --> 01:38:14,376
Colonel, you've blown your last bugle.
Get this guy out of here.

1596
01:38:14,580 --> 01:38:16,855
Dear me! Another yellow-fever victim?

1597
01:38:17,300 --> 01:38:19,814
All the bodies in the cellar
are yellow-fever victims.

1598
01:38:19,900 --> 01:38:23,176
No, Colonel. This is a spy.
We caught him at the White House.

1599
01:38:23,260 --> 01:38:25,728
Take him out and bring him to.
I want to question him.

1600
01:38:25,820 --> 01:38:29,335
- Questioning of spies is my department.
- Hey, you, keep out of that.

1601
01:38:29,660 --> 01:38:33,573
You're forgetting that as President
I am also head of the Secret Service.

1602
01:38:43,540 --> 01:38:44,655
Who are you?

1603
01:38:45,180 --> 01:38:46,329
What's your name?

1604
01:38:46,420 --> 01:38:49,218
Usually, I'm Mortimer Brewster.
But I'm not myself today.

1605
01:38:49,300 --> 01:38:53,179
You're his brother. Look, no argument.
He's got to be put away.

1606
01:38:53,300 --> 01:38:57,816
No arguments, Captain. No arguments.
Just a minute, take it easy. Read this.

1607
01:38:57,900 --> 01:38:59,777
Teddy's going to go to Happy Dale tonight.

1608
01:38:59,860 --> 01:39:03,057
- I'm waiting for Mr. Witherspoon.
- As long as he's going someplace.

1609
01:39:03,140 --> 01:39:05,256
He's scaring the neighbors with that bugle.

1610
01:39:05,340 --> 01:39:08,650
And that cockeyed story
about 13 bodies being...

1611
01:39:16,940 --> 01:39:20,216
I've been without sleep for 48 hours.
I'm liable to think anything.

1612
01:39:20,300 --> 01:39:22,211
I know just how you feel.

1613
01:39:22,380 --> 01:39:24,530
There's people dumb enough
to believe that.

1614
01:39:24,620 --> 01:39:27,692
Last year there was a crazy guy,
started a murder rumor.

1615
01:39:27,820 --> 01:39:30,380
I had to dig up a half acre plot
before I could prove...

1616
01:39:30,460 --> 01:39:32,337
- What's this?
- What's the matter?

1617
01:39:32,420 --> 01:39:34,138
- These papers aren't any good.
- Why not?

1618
01:39:34,220 --> 01:39:36,688
He signed it Theodore Roosevelt!

1619
01:39:41,500 --> 01:39:44,731
- Is your taxi engaged?
- Losing dough every minute. Any offers?

1620
01:39:44,860 --> 01:39:48,853
I'm Mr. Witherspoon of Happy Dale
Sanitarium, I have come to get a Brewster.

1621
01:39:48,940 --> 01:39:51,977
I would like you to drive us back
to the sanitarium.

1622
01:39:53,220 --> 01:39:55,814
I knew this would end up in a nuthouse!

1623
01:39:57,260 --> 01:40:00,297
We like to think of it as a rest home.

1624
01:40:10,780 --> 01:40:11,895
Mr. Brewster?

1625
01:40:15,460 --> 01:40:17,212
Mr. Witherspoon is here.

1626
01:40:20,860 --> 01:40:24,648
Supposing the spy steals this document
and finds the name Roosevelt on it.

1627
01:40:24,780 --> 01:40:27,738
Think what that would mean
to the safety of the nation!

1628
01:40:27,820 --> 01:40:30,288
- No, it's chicanery.
- What is this? Come on!

1629
01:40:30,380 --> 01:40:33,497
- He's come to. He's ready to talk.
- Hold him till I get there.

1630
01:40:33,580 --> 01:40:37,095
Let me explain. The name Brewster
is code for Roosevelt.

1631
01:40:37,500 --> 01:40:39,695
- Code for Roosevelt?
- Take the name Brewster.

1632
01:40:39,780 --> 01:40:41,850
Take away the "B" and what have you got?

1633
01:40:41,940 --> 01:40:44,215
- Rooster.
- And what does a rooster do?

1634
01:40:44,300 --> 01:40:47,610
- Crows.
- It crows! Where do you hunt in Africa?

1635
01:40:47,780 --> 01:40:49,975
- On the veldt!
- There you are! "Crowsveldt".

1636
01:40:50,060 --> 01:40:53,257
Ingenious! My compliments
to the boys in the code department.

1637
01:40:53,340 --> 01:40:55,410
That's all right! Do that again for me.

1638
01:40:55,500 --> 01:40:58,014
Never mind! Give me that pen.

1639
01:40:58,780 --> 01:41:00,293
This is fun.

1640
01:41:00,660 --> 01:41:02,969
Now, all I got to get is Witherspoon.

1641
01:41:09,540 --> 01:41:11,292
I'm so glad to see you.

1642
01:41:13,220 --> 01:41:15,017
You will take good care of Teddy?

1643
01:41:15,100 --> 01:41:17,375
- Best of care of him.
- That's fine.

1644
01:41:17,500 --> 01:41:19,252
And no wagon when he leaves.

1645
01:41:19,340 --> 01:41:21,376
Why? To take him away? Never, never.

1646
01:41:21,460 --> 01:41:24,179
Taxicabs. We always...
I have one waiting now.

1647
01:41:24,300 --> 01:41:25,813
It means a great deal to me.

1648
01:41:25,900 --> 01:41:28,858
You will personally see
that Teddy's happy at Happy Dale?

1649
01:41:28,940 --> 01:41:31,295
- He'll be very happy at Happy Dale.
- That's good.

1650
01:41:31,380 --> 01:41:34,372
You know, I sometimes envy
some of our patients, secretly.

1651
01:41:34,460 --> 01:41:37,577
You do? It must be a nice place.
I've never been there.

1652
01:41:37,660 --> 01:41:39,571
You never can tell.

1653
01:41:39,940 --> 01:41:42,818
This is a particularly happy moment
for me tonight.

1654
01:41:42,900 --> 01:41:46,688
- I've never met a dramatic critic before.
- The woods are full of them.

1655
01:41:46,780 --> 01:41:50,216
I have here something that will explain
what we're trying to do.

1656
01:41:50,300 --> 01:41:53,690
- A pamphlet about Happy Dale?
- No, it's a play.

1657
01:41:53,820 --> 01:41:55,492
Something I've been working on.

1658
01:41:55,580 --> 01:41:59,175
It's a dramatization of many incidents
that have happened at Happy Dale.

1659
01:41:59,260 --> 01:42:00,852
Captain! Captain!

1660
01:42:02,140 --> 01:42:06,497
I want you to read this carefully.
I want you to be just as harsh as you like.

1661
01:42:06,580 --> 01:42:07,933
I shan't mind, you know...

1662
01:42:08,020 --> 01:42:10,329
Captain, this is Mr. Witherspoon.

1663
01:42:12,860 --> 01:42:14,737
He'll be very happy at Happy Dale.

1664
01:42:14,820 --> 01:42:16,731
- Come, my boy.
- What is this?

1665
01:42:18,220 --> 01:42:21,451
No, you got it wrong.
This is Captain Rooney.

1666
01:42:21,660 --> 01:42:23,252
The police?

1667
01:42:24,620 --> 01:42:28,533
I'm sure! Here are the papers, all signed.
Now you can take him away.

1668
01:42:28,620 --> 01:42:30,736
I'll be in my office vetoing some bills.

1669
01:42:30,820 --> 01:42:33,095
Mr. President, I have good news for you.

1670
01:42:33,180 --> 01:42:35,489
Your term of office is over.

1671
01:42:36,340 --> 01:42:38,774
- Is this March 4?
- Practically.

1672
01:42:38,860 --> 01:42:40,134
Let's see...

1673
01:42:42,340 --> 01:42:44,570
Now I go on my hunting trip to Africa!

1674
01:42:44,700 --> 01:42:47,260
Well, I must get started immediately.

1675
01:42:53,220 --> 01:42:56,337
Is he trying to move into the White House
before I've moved out?

1676
01:42:56,420 --> 01:42:58,172
Who, Mr. President?

1677
01:42:58,260 --> 01:42:59,090
Taft!

1678
01:43:02,220 --> 01:43:07,089
No, this isn't Mr. Taft.
It's Mr. Witherspoon, your guide to Africa.

1679
01:43:07,420 --> 01:43:08,819
Bully! Bully!

1680
01:43:08,980 --> 01:43:11,494
Wait right here.
I'll bring down my equipment.

1681
01:43:11,580 --> 01:43:12,615
Happy man.

1682
01:43:12,860 --> 01:43:14,851
Goodbye, Aunt Abby, Aunt Martha.

1683
01:43:14,940 --> 01:43:17,613
I'm on my way to Africa.
Isn't it wonderful?

1684
01:43:17,700 --> 01:43:18,735
Charge!

1685
01:43:21,380 --> 01:43:23,211
It's all right, I've got it.

1686
01:43:24,260 --> 01:43:25,170
Oh, dear.

1687
01:43:25,660 --> 01:43:28,538
And Happy Dale is full of staircases.

1688
01:43:33,420 --> 01:43:36,059
You've come to meet Teddy, haven't you?

1689
01:43:36,140 --> 01:43:39,815
No, he's come to take him.
Teddy's been blowing his bugle again.

1690
01:43:39,900 --> 01:43:43,051
No, he can't go now! We won't permit it.

1691
01:43:43,180 --> 01:43:45,569
We promise to take his bugle
away from him.

1692
01:43:45,660 --> 01:43:48,891
- We won't be separated from Teddy.
- I'm sorry.

1693
01:43:50,420 --> 01:43:52,536
How can you allow this? You promised.

1694
01:43:52,620 --> 01:43:55,817
Brewster's got nothing to do with this.
The law is the law!

1695
01:43:55,940 --> 01:43:58,454
Teddy's committed himself
and he's got to go.

1696
01:43:59,300 --> 01:44:04,294
- If he's going, we're going, too!
- Yes, you'll have to take us with him.

1697
01:44:05,180 --> 01:44:07,330
Why not? Why not, indeed?

1698
01:44:08,580 --> 01:44:12,732
It's sweet of them, but impossible.
We never take sane people at Happy Dale.

1699
01:44:17,100 --> 01:44:21,252
These little sane people will get lost
in the shuffle. You could arrange that.

1700
01:44:21,340 --> 01:44:24,218
Just put them in
and they'll get all mixed up.

1701
01:44:24,460 --> 01:44:26,735
Too dangerous. Dissension, jealousy.

1702
01:44:30,220 --> 01:44:32,131
Now, let's be sensible, ladies.

1703
01:44:32,260 --> 01:44:35,491
Here I am wasting my time
when I could be doing some serious work.

1704
01:44:35,580 --> 01:44:37,969
There are still murders
to be solved in Brooklyn.

1705
01:44:38,060 --> 01:44:41,211
It ain't only his bugle blowing.
Things are going to get worse.

1706
01:44:41,300 --> 01:44:43,939
We're liable to have to dig up your cellar.

1707
01:44:44,020 --> 01:44:45,294
Our cellar?

1708
01:44:46,500 --> 01:44:50,015
Teddy's been telling around
there's 13 bodies buried in the cellar.

1709
01:44:50,100 --> 01:44:52,455
There are 13 bodies in our cellar.

1710
01:44:58,140 --> 01:44:58,936
What?

1711
01:44:59,020 --> 01:45:02,376
Yes. You just ask our nephew, Mortimer.

1712
01:45:07,380 --> 01:45:08,369
Charge!

1713
01:45:14,540 --> 01:45:15,973
Isn't that amazing?

1714
01:45:17,180 --> 01:45:18,693
You behave yourself.

1715
01:45:18,780 --> 01:45:21,852
You know very well there are
13 bodies down in our cellar.

1716
01:45:21,940 --> 01:45:24,090
Certainly there's 13 bodies in the cellar.

1717
01:45:24,180 --> 01:45:27,889
And there are hundreds more
up in the attic, Captain!

1718
01:45:32,100 --> 01:45:34,330
- What is this?
- You mustn't mind Mortimer.

1719
01:45:34,420 --> 01:45:36,331
- How about it?
- I'll be right there.

1720
01:45:36,420 --> 01:45:38,251
He's been a little strange all day.

1721
01:45:38,340 --> 01:45:41,969
Right now I wouldn't know what is
and what ain't strange anymore.

1722
01:45:42,060 --> 01:45:44,938
- I'll look in that cellar.
- I'll tell you what we'll do.

1723
01:45:45,020 --> 01:45:48,410
I'll bring my bodies from the attic
and you get yours from the cellar...

1724
01:45:48,500 --> 01:45:53,210
...and we'll get them all together,
and we'll send them to Happy Dale.

1725
01:45:55,100 --> 01:45:58,729
No, you wouldn't have to dig.
The graves are all marked.

1726
01:45:59,140 --> 01:46:02,052
- We put flowers on them every Sunday.
- Flowers?

1727
01:46:02,140 --> 01:46:04,654
Sure, I put neon lights on mine.

1728
01:46:06,420 --> 01:46:08,058
Humor them, humor them.

1729
01:46:08,780 --> 01:46:09,735
Smile.

1730
01:46:12,140 --> 01:46:14,415
There's one down there, a Mr. Spenalzo...

1731
01:46:14,500 --> 01:46:15,649
Hasn't got it yet.

1732
01:46:15,740 --> 01:46:18,015
...who doesn't belong here
and has to leave.

1733
01:46:18,100 --> 01:46:21,854
- But the other 12 are our gentlemen.
- Your gentlemen?

1734
01:46:21,940 --> 01:46:24,818
You'd like mine better.
None of mine are gentlemen.

1735
01:46:25,980 --> 01:46:28,494
- You mustn't mind him at all.
- He got married today.

1736
01:46:28,580 --> 01:46:31,890
"There is a Happy Dale far, far away

1737
01:46:31,980 --> 01:46:33,936
"There is a Happy"

1738
01:46:38,100 --> 01:46:40,056
He got it. It's amazing.

1739
01:46:40,660 --> 01:46:43,094
Don't you think you can find room
for the ladies?

1740
01:46:43,180 --> 01:46:44,533
Just the ladies?

1741
01:46:46,100 --> 01:46:47,818
Just the ladies!

1742
01:46:48,740 --> 01:46:51,254
- How about it?
- They'd have to be committed.

1743
01:46:51,940 --> 01:46:53,976
Teddy committed himself. Couldn't they?

1744
01:46:54,060 --> 01:46:56,733
- All they have to do is sign the papers.
- Certainly.

1745
01:46:56,820 --> 01:46:59,857
If we can go with Teddy,
we'll sign the papers.

1746
01:46:59,940 --> 01:47:01,134
Where are they?

1747
01:47:01,220 --> 01:47:03,211
I have them, ladies, right here.

1748
01:47:03,420 --> 01:47:06,412
Sign them up, will you?
I want this all cleaned up.

1749
01:47:06,540 --> 01:47:10,215
I'm going out to talk to that spy.
Maybe I can understand him.

1750
01:47:10,460 --> 01:47:12,337
Thirteen bodies in the cellar.

1751
01:47:12,460 --> 01:47:14,098
Ladies, if you'll sign right here.

1752
01:47:24,980 --> 01:47:26,379
- Here?
- Yes, please.

1753
01:47:26,500 --> 01:47:28,536
It's on the right-hand side there.

1754
01:47:28,620 --> 01:47:30,850
I'm really looking forward to going.

1755
01:47:30,940 --> 01:47:33,249
The neighborhood here has changed so.

1756
01:47:33,380 --> 01:47:36,531
Yes. Especially since they won
that old pennant thing.

1757
01:47:39,500 --> 01:47:42,060
Oh, dear, I'm so sorry.
We've overlooked something.

1758
01:47:42,140 --> 01:47:45,576
It's absolutely compulsory that we have
the signature of a physician.

1759
01:47:45,660 --> 01:47:46,775
A doctor.

1760
01:47:46,900 --> 01:47:49,460
Dr. Einstein! Come here
and sign some papers, please.

1761
01:47:49,540 --> 01:47:51,531
- Good night.
- Come here, Dr. Einstein.

1762
01:47:51,620 --> 01:47:52,814
- A doctor?
- Yes.

1763
01:47:52,940 --> 01:47:56,489
Dr. Einstein almost operated on me earlier.
Come along, Doctor.

1764
01:47:58,580 --> 01:48:01,219
Now, here. Just sign right here,
please, Doctor.

1765
01:48:01,300 --> 01:48:03,814
- Were you leaving, Doctor?
- Yes, please.

1766
01:48:03,900 --> 01:48:06,698
Aren't you going to wait for Jonathan?

1767
01:48:06,820 --> 01:48:09,618
I don't think we go to the same place.

1768
01:48:10,020 --> 01:48:13,296
Hello, Mac. We picked up that guy
that's wanted in Indiana.

1769
01:48:13,380 --> 01:48:16,372
His accomplice's description is
on the circular, on the desk.

1770
01:48:16,460 --> 01:48:17,495
Read it to me, will you?

1771
01:48:19,980 --> 01:48:21,174
About 40.

1772
01:48:21,660 --> 01:48:23,139
Five-foot-three.

1773
01:48:23,460 --> 01:48:24,973
One hundred and forty pounds.

1774
01:48:25,620 --> 01:48:26,894
Pop eyes.

1775
01:48:28,380 --> 01:48:30,371
Talks with a German accent.

1776
01:48:30,700 --> 01:48:32,133
Poses as a doctor.

1777
01:48:32,340 --> 01:48:33,819
Okay, Mac. Thanks.

1778
01:48:33,940 --> 01:48:37,091
It's all right. The doctor
has completed the signatures.

1779
01:48:37,220 --> 01:48:38,414
That's great!

1780
01:48:38,580 --> 01:48:41,970
Thanks, Doc.
You've done Brooklyn a great service.

1781
01:48:46,940 --> 01:48:48,737
But Dr. Einstein!

1782
01:48:52,060 --> 01:48:55,370
- Now, Mr. Witherspoon...
- You're Witherspoon, I'm Brewster.

1783
01:48:55,500 --> 01:48:58,094
It's contagious, yes. It's your turn.

1784
01:48:58,460 --> 01:49:00,496
- Don't play games...
- You sign.

1785
01:49:00,620 --> 01:49:02,656
You sign as next of kin.

1786
01:49:03,020 --> 01:49:06,410
Why didn't you say so?
I'm all confused. Don't mind me.

1787
01:49:08,260 --> 01:49:09,534
Mr. Witherport.

1788
01:49:09,980 --> 01:49:11,811
- Spoon.
- Here.

1789
01:49:12,420 --> 01:49:13,739
Come up and pack my duffel.

1790
01:49:16,020 --> 01:49:17,169
Duffel?

1791
01:49:17,260 --> 01:49:19,820
Pack his duffel. He's President, you know?

1792
01:49:20,180 --> 01:49:22,091
And bring along my bugle.

1793
01:49:23,860 --> 01:49:24,975
President.

1794
01:49:33,900 --> 01:49:35,219
Don't charge!

1795
01:49:47,900 --> 01:49:50,858
We're really very worried about something.

1796
01:49:51,620 --> 01:49:54,214
Now, darling, don't be worried.

1797
01:49:54,700 --> 01:49:57,772
- Me too, Mortimer.
- Well, of course, darling.

1798
01:49:58,620 --> 01:50:00,611
You'll both be very happy at Happy Dale.

1799
01:50:00,700 --> 01:50:04,898
We're very happy about the whole thing,
but that's just it.

1800
01:50:05,220 --> 01:50:07,370
We don't want anything to go wrong.

1801
01:50:09,220 --> 01:50:11,893
Will they investigate those signatures?

1802
01:50:12,900 --> 01:50:16,688
- They won't look up Dr. Einstein...
- But it's not his signature, dear.

1803
01:50:16,820 --> 01:50:18,651
- It's yours.
- Mine?

1804
01:50:18,740 --> 01:50:21,857
You see, you signed as next of kin.

1805
01:50:22,140 --> 01:50:26,179
- What's wrong about that, darling?
- Martha, you tell him.

1806
01:50:28,220 --> 01:50:29,494
Well, dear.

1807
01:50:29,580 --> 01:50:33,334
- What, dear?
- You're not really a Brewster.

1808
01:50:34,660 --> 01:50:37,094
- What?
- Your mother came to us as a cook.

1809
01:50:37,220 --> 01:50:39,450
And you were born
about three months afterwards.

1810
01:50:39,540 --> 01:50:42,373
And she was such a sweet woman
and such a good cook...

1811
01:50:42,460 --> 01:50:45,896
...we didn't want to lose her.
So brother married her.

1812
01:50:46,140 --> 01:50:48,131
Your real father was a cook, too.

1813
01:50:48,260 --> 01:50:51,297
He was a chef on a tramp steamer.

1814
01:50:54,540 --> 01:50:57,691
You mean I'm not really a Brewster?

1815
01:50:59,620 --> 01:51:02,134
- Darling!
- Don't feel so badly about it.

1816
01:51:02,260 --> 01:51:05,252
I'm sure it won't make any difference
to Elaine.

1817
01:51:13,940 --> 01:51:16,898
Where are you? Can you hear me?
I'm not really a Brewster!

1818
01:51:16,980 --> 01:51:18,777
I'm the son of a sea cook!

1819
01:51:24,980 --> 01:51:27,096
It's true! I saw them. It's true.

1820
01:51:27,220 --> 01:51:29,734
It's true! There are 13 bodies down there!

1821
01:51:29,900 --> 01:51:31,572
But I saw them...

1822
01:51:33,100 --> 01:51:34,613
What's all this screaming about?

1823
01:51:34,700 --> 01:51:37,737
- But I saw them...
- It's way past her bedtime.

1824
01:51:39,220 --> 01:51:40,335
Quiet!

1825
01:51:43,780 --> 01:51:45,896
- But, Mortimer...
- Goodbye!

1826
01:51:45,980 --> 01:51:48,210
- 'Bye.
- Goodbye, darling!

1827
01:51:50,260 --> 01:51:53,377
- What is all this?
- They're going on their honeymoon.

1828
01:51:53,780 --> 01:51:55,736
They're off to a flying start.

1829
01:52:02,020 --> 01:52:03,419
I really did see...

1830
01:52:04,020 --> 01:52:06,056
You'll own two cabs!

1831
01:52:06,740 --> 01:52:08,856
I mean the meter!

1832
01:52:09,180 --> 01:52:10,693
Oh, Mortimer.

1833
01:52:21,220 --> 01:52:23,609
We're going to Niagara Falls.
Call me a cab, dear.

1834
01:52:23,700 --> 01:52:25,053
Yes, love.

1835
01:52:26,100 --> 01:52:27,658
But, Mr. Brewster!

1836
01:52:27,780 --> 01:52:31,011
I'm not a Brewster.
I'm a son of a sea cook.

1837
01:52:31,900 --> 01:52:32,935
Charge!

1838
01:52:34,860 --> 01:52:37,852
I'm not a cabdriver. I'm a coffeepot!
