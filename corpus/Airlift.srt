1
00:04:48,501 --> 00:04:51,709
And finally...

2
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:56,917
How do you fit 30 Iraqis
in one telephone booth?

3
00:04:59,834 --> 00:05:03,292
Tell them that it
does not belong to them!

4
00:05:05,501 --> 00:05:06,417
Goodbye!

5
00:05:06,501 --> 00:05:07,667
Congratulations!

6
00:05:07,792 --> 00:05:09,251
You're very kind, Excellency.

7
00:05:09,334 --> 00:05:11,251
Oh, I'm a mere Prince, Ranjit.

8
00:05:11,334 --> 00:05:12,959
Answerable to His Excellency.

9
00:05:13,042 --> 00:05:14,167
The Emir.

10
00:05:14,376 --> 00:05:17,292
But Ranjit,
you know this deal would mean...

11
00:05:17,376 --> 00:05:20,126
...a lot of your friends
will be unhappy with you.

12
00:05:20,334 --> 00:05:22,376
So, how do you explain to them?

13
00:05:22,626 --> 00:05:25,542
To me, profit explains everything.

14
00:05:25,834 --> 00:05:26,667
Everything.

15
00:05:26,751 --> 00:05:28,584
Always the shrewd businessman.

16
00:05:28,709 --> 00:05:29,709
You should rule, Your Excellency...

17
00:05:29,792 --> 00:05:31,084
...and let me slave in peace.

18
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:36,667
Goodbye!

19
00:05:46,292 --> 00:05:47,292
Heemaar!

20
00:05:47,376 --> 00:05:48,334
Sorry, sir?

21
00:05:48,542 --> 00:05:50,334
Donkey, Nair, Donkey!

22
00:05:50,834 --> 00:05:53,251
Your India is fully of them

23
00:05:53,417 --> 00:05:55,334
But seems like only
I run into them in Kuwait.

24
00:05:55,917 --> 00:05:57,751
Play some music.
- Okay, sir.

25
00:06:03,667 --> 00:06:05,709
Nair, you're still not a Kuwaiti.

26
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:09,626
Haven't you learn't anything from me.

27
00:06:09,876 --> 00:06:11,001
Sorry, sir.

28
00:06:13,251 --> 00:06:14,417
Thank you.

29
00:06:29,584 --> 00:06:30,667
Just have a little.

30
00:06:31,334 --> 00:06:32,334
Simu, that's it

31
00:06:32,417 --> 00:06:34,001
Goodnight.
- No, mama...five minutes.

32
00:06:34,084 --> 00:06:35,376
No five minutes, that's it.

33
00:06:35,459 --> 00:06:36,751
Simu.

34
00:06:36,917 --> 00:06:40,334
Simu. Come on, jump. Jump. Jump.

35
00:06:40,542 --> 00:06:44,001
Jump. Jump. Jump.

36
00:06:44,584 --> 00:06:45,959
Goodnight.

37
00:06:46,042 --> 00:06:47,126
Where's my kiss.

38
00:06:47,542 --> 00:06:48,792
Goodnight.

39
00:06:49,167 --> 00:06:50,959
Goodnight, sweetheart.
Don't be scared.

40
00:06:51,042 --> 00:06:52,667
Rita. - Yes, ma'am.
- Just tuck her in

41
00:06:53,417 --> 00:06:54,834
Keep the door open.

42
00:06:56,251 --> 00:06:58,167
Why is Simu still awake?

43
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:00,626
Don't worry,
we won't be late for the party.

44
00:07:03,292 --> 00:07:05,292
And anyway...she's a kid,
not your car...

45
00:07:05,376 --> 00:07:06,959
...that you can turn off with a key.

46
00:07:08,292 --> 00:07:09,584
You've already started?

47
00:07:10,292 --> 00:07:12,792
Decide... whether you want
to party or fight?

48
00:07:13,626 --> 00:07:14,959
Me?

49
00:07:16,584 --> 00:07:17,709
OK. Let's party.

50
00:07:27,584 --> 00:07:28,917
Nair, your family must be thrilled.

51
00:07:29,001 --> 00:07:29,917
Yes, madam.

52
00:07:30,001 --> 00:07:31,376
It's my daughter's
first visit to India.

53
00:07:31,459 --> 00:07:33,751
Look ahead, Nair.

54
00:07:33,834 --> 00:07:34,792
This isn't India.

55
00:07:34,876 --> 00:07:36,584
Ranjit.
- What?

56
00:07:37,417 --> 00:07:38,876
Fine, fine...take
your daughter along too.

57
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:39,626
She's only four years old...

58
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,084
No one will ask her
for any bribe either.

59
00:07:41,167 --> 00:07:43,084
Take her to India.
She'll like it.

60
00:07:47,292 --> 00:07:49,834
Be in a good mood.
- We'll see.

61
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:53,501
And please don't drink too much.
- We'll see.

62
00:07:53,834 --> 00:07:56,459
Hey, guys.
- How are you, Ranjit?

63
00:07:56,542 --> 00:07:58,376
Hello, how are you?
- Very good. Hi.

64
00:07:58,751 --> 00:08:01,751
Hi, you're looking beautiful.
As usual.

65
00:08:01,834 --> 00:08:02,959
Hi, how are you?

66
00:08:03,042 --> 00:08:04,084
So nice to see you.

67
00:08:04,167 --> 00:08:04,876
Ashok.

68
00:08:05,792 --> 00:08:06,709
How are you?

69
00:08:06,792 --> 00:08:07,792
Well...

70
00:08:08,001 --> 00:08:10,834
Ranjit, where's Prem?
- Prem?

71
00:08:11,292 --> 00:08:12,667
I invited him...
Hasn't he shown up yet?

72
00:08:12,834 --> 00:08:15,959
You ruined him,
and then invited him..

73
00:08:16,209 --> 00:08:17,292
Why would he come?

74
00:08:17,626 --> 00:08:19,251
The Fawad deal was his, Ranjit.

75
00:08:19,501 --> 00:08:20,376
You snatched it.

76
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:23,709
You should never mix
business and friendship

77
00:08:24,209 --> 00:08:26,542
It's his problem
that he didn't show up.

78
00:08:26,834 --> 00:08:29,459
Even witches spare friends.
- I am a demon.

79
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:33,709
How about some blood?
- No, Mr. Demon.

80
00:08:33,959 --> 00:08:35,459
You drink it.
- Thank you.

81
00:09:19,584 --> 00:09:23,042
"My heart's lost
in those Arabic eyes."

82
00:09:24,292 --> 00:09:27,667
"Your lies have plundered me."

83
00:09:37,917 --> 00:09:41,209
"My heart's lost
in those Arabic eyes."

84
00:09:42,584 --> 00:09:45,917
"Your lies have plundered me."

85
00:09:47,209 --> 00:09:50,792
"My heart's lost
in those Arabic eyes."

86
00:09:51,709 --> 00:09:55,292
"Your lies have plundered me."

87
00:09:56,042 --> 00:09:58,334
"it was lying inside my chest..."

88
00:09:58,417 --> 00:10:00,459
"...in the season of love."

89
00:10:00,709 --> 00:10:02,459
"A single gesture..."

90
00:10:02,709 --> 00:10:04,834
"...and I gave my heart to you.

91
00:10:05,042 --> 00:10:06,084
"Gave it..."

92
00:10:06,167 --> 00:10:07,167
"Gave it..."

93
00:10:07,292 --> 00:10:09,167
"Gave it..."

94
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:10,542
"Gave it..."

95
00:10:10,751 --> 00:10:11,876
"Gave it..."

96
00:10:11,917 --> 00:10:13,959
"Gave you my heart..."

97
00:10:14,209 --> 00:10:15,334
"Gave it..."

98
00:10:44,126 --> 00:10:47,876
"Magnificent...simply magnificent."

99
00:10:47,959 --> 00:10:50,126
"You're just so addictive."

100
00:10:50,334 --> 00:10:52,376
"Sweetheart, you're just too good."

101
00:10:53,251 --> 00:10:54,667
"Amazing..."

102
00:10:54,917 --> 00:10:57,001
"Your attitude's simply amazing."

103
00:10:57,209 --> 00:10:59,251
"You're so stubborn."

104
00:10:59,501 --> 00:11:01,501
"Sweetheart, you're just too good."

105
00:11:02,376 --> 00:11:04,542
"Every time I looked at you.

106
00:11:04,751 --> 00:11:06,876
"L never thought twice."

107
00:11:07,042 --> 00:11:09,126
"A single gesture..."

108
00:11:09,167 --> 00:11:11,251
"...and I gave my heart to you.

109
00:11:11,376 --> 00:11:12,417
"Gave it..."

110
00:11:12,501 --> 00:11:13,501
"Gave it..."

111
00:11:13,542 --> 00:11:15,417
"Gave it..."

112
00:11:15,876 --> 00:11:16,751
"Gave it..."

113
00:11:17,001 --> 00:11:18,126
"Gave it..."

114
00:11:18,251 --> 00:11:20,417
"Gave you my heart..."

115
00:11:20,501 --> 00:11:21,501
"Gave it..."

116
00:11:21,626 --> 00:11:22,626
"Gave it..."

117
00:11:22,792 --> 00:11:24,959
"Gave it..."

118
00:11:25,001 --> 00:11:25,876
"Gave it..."

119
00:11:26,126 --> 00:11:27,251
"Gave it..."

120
00:11:27,376 --> 00:11:29,501
"Gave you my heart..."

121
00:11:29,626 --> 00:11:30,626
"Gave it..."

122
00:13:27,792 --> 00:13:30,251
Go! Go! Go fast!

123
00:13:32,376 --> 00:13:37,251
You go to the right.

124
00:13:52,501 --> 00:13:53,667
Hello.

125
00:14:03,417 --> 00:14:04,501
Hold on.

126
00:14:04,834 --> 00:14:08,042
'Iraq and Kuwait had shared
a tense relationship for some time.'

127
00:14:09,626 --> 00:14:12,917
'The tension was caused
by what always causes tension'

128
00:14:13,501 --> 00:14:14,376
'Money.'

129
00:14:15,334 --> 00:14:17,626
'Iraq owed Kuwait 14 billion dollars...'

130
00:14:17,917 --> 00:14:19,376
'...that Iraq wanted waived.'

131
00:14:19,459 --> 00:14:20,501
Okay, I'll call you later.

132
00:14:20,584 --> 00:14:23,417
'They were also demanding that
Kuwait produce less oil...'

133
00:14:23,501 --> 00:14:26,042
'...so that oil prices go up...'

134
00:14:26,417 --> 00:14:28,792
'...and Iraq profits more.'

135
00:14:30,501 --> 00:14:32,042
'Amidst these apologies
and threats...'

136
00:14:32,542 --> 00:14:34,376
'...the Iraqis also
accused the Kuwaitis of...

137
00:14:35,042 --> 00:14:36,126
'...stealing oil.'

138
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:39,084
'We had grown used
to these threats by now.'

139
00:14:39,209 --> 00:14:41,917
'And believed that the
situation wouldn't change'

140
00:14:42,376 --> 00:14:43,626
'But we were wrong.'

141
00:14:43,876 --> 00:14:44,917
'It did.'

142
00:14:45,167 --> 00:14:48,876
'And along with it, changed
the identities of us Kuwaitis.'

143
00:14:50,709 --> 00:14:51,959
Ranjit?

144
00:14:53,251 --> 00:14:57,417
Ashok called.
- At 3am?

145
00:14:58,376 --> 00:15:02,626
Apparently Saddam attacked Kuwait.
- Come on, Ranjit.

146
00:15:03,542 --> 00:15:06,501
I am sure there must have been
some minor action at the border.

147
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:08,667
Ranjit...lt's 1990
- I've an idea.

148
00:15:09,584 --> 00:15:11,667
Simran and you go to London.

149
00:15:11,751 --> 00:15:13,917
Do you really think
there's some kind of threat?

150
00:15:14,001 --> 00:15:15,042
I don't think so.

151
00:15:15,126 --> 00:15:17,334
I'm sure schools will
be closed for few days.

152
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:18,917
You can come back in a week.

153
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:20,501
And everything will be fine.

154
00:15:21,459 --> 00:15:24,251
Could Saddam have really..
- Nothing has happened.

155
00:15:24,334 --> 00:15:27,376
What is wrong with you?
- Nothing, I just...

156
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:29,209
Do me a favour.
Go back to bed.

157
00:15:29,417 --> 00:15:30,876
Go! I just want to make some calls.

158
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:33,001
Go. Carry on. - Okay.
- Go, go.

159
00:15:46,001 --> 00:15:48,876
Kuwaitis! Come out!

160
00:15:49,584 --> 00:15:51,126
This is our land now!

161
00:15:54,251 --> 00:15:58,042
Hail Saddam!
- Get down.

162
00:16:02,167 --> 00:16:03,042
Hail Saddam!

163
00:16:03,126 --> 00:16:03,876
Hail Saddam!

164
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:04,876
Hail Saddam!

165
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:05,709
Hail Saddam!

166
00:16:05,792 --> 00:16:06,626
Hail Saddam!

167
00:16:06,709 --> 00:16:07,667
Hail Saddam!

168
00:16:13,334 --> 00:16:15,334
- Oh God! How bad is it?
- Very bad!

169
00:16:51,584 --> 00:16:53,917
Just when I need them
most no one takes my calls.

170
00:16:54,001 --> 00:16:56,626
Did you try Sheikh Faisal
at the Internal Ministry?

171
00:16:56,709 --> 00:16:59,126
Don't tell me who to call.

172
00:16:59,209 --> 00:17:01,667
Why are you shouting?
- I've already tried him, Amrita.

173
00:17:01,834 --> 00:17:03,459
Relax, Ranjit.

174
00:17:04,459 --> 00:17:06,417
The entire Kuwaiti Government is gone.

175
00:17:06,501 --> 00:17:08,084
There's not a single official here.

176
00:17:08,167 --> 00:17:10,417
We're practically without
a government, and you are...

177
00:17:10,501 --> 00:17:12,376
Gone?
- Yes.

178
00:17:12,501 --> 00:17:14,959
They ran away the
first chance they got.

179
00:17:15,042 --> 00:17:16,459
Don't they have any responsibility...

180
00:17:16,542 --> 00:17:17,542
...towards their own people?

181
00:17:17,626 --> 00:17:19,042
Amrita...
- Mummy.

182
00:17:19,209 --> 00:17:20,251
Why is Simu awake?

183
00:17:20,334 --> 00:17:23,501
There's no school today.
Go. Go back to sleep.

184
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:26,126
Rita, please take her inside.

185
00:17:26,209 --> 00:17:27,917
Go, baby. Go inside, please.

186
00:17:31,501 --> 00:17:33,001
Nair, what's happening outside?

187
00:17:33,084 --> 00:17:34,126
Sir, I avoided the main roads...

188
00:17:34,209 --> 00:17:35,334
...and took the highway to get here.

189
00:17:35,542 --> 00:17:36,792
The Iraqi army is everywhere.

190
00:17:36,876 --> 00:17:37,834
They're checking everyone.

191
00:17:37,917 --> 00:17:39,167
They're sparing everyone else...

192
00:17:39,251 --> 00:17:41,334
...but seeking out
Kuwaitis and killing them.

193
00:17:41,417 --> 00:17:43,834
Ranjit, why did you call him...?
- Amrita, mind your own business...

194
00:17:43,917 --> 00:17:45,251
...and let me do mine.

195
00:17:45,334 --> 00:17:46,584
Get the car, I'll go get ready.

196
00:17:46,876 --> 00:17:49,501
Now you're going out too!?
- Just calm down.

197
00:17:49,584 --> 00:17:50,751
What's wrong with you?

198
00:17:50,834 --> 00:17:51,876
I'm going to the Embassy.

199
00:17:51,959 --> 00:17:53,917
We'll get out of Kuwait
once everything's arranged.

200
00:17:54,001 --> 00:17:55,709
Okay. Relax now.

201
00:18:19,251 --> 00:18:20,626
Nair, don't be scared.

202
00:18:26,417 --> 00:18:28,376
Stop the car!

203
00:18:29,501 --> 00:18:30,167
Turn the car off!

204
00:18:31,501 --> 00:18:33,084
Get out! Where are you going?

205
00:18:33,126 --> 00:18:37,042
Do you have any papers?

206
00:18:41,042 --> 00:18:42,667
He's my boss.
- Nair, don't speak in arabic.

207
00:18:42,834 --> 00:18:44,834
Nair, get in the car.
Nair don't speak in arabic.

208
00:18:44,917 --> 00:18:46,209
He's my boss.

209
00:19:34,126 --> 00:19:36,376
Get in!

210
00:19:42,334 --> 00:19:44,042
Play the music

211
00:19:48,542 --> 00:19:51,917
What's that shining in your hand?
Give it to us.

212
00:19:52,209 --> 00:19:53,876
Good, good!

213
00:19:57,584 --> 00:19:59,126
Let's go

214
00:20:18,001 --> 00:20:19,542
Come on, move.

215
00:20:23,501 --> 00:20:26,126
'You must be really happy today'.

216
00:20:30,126 --> 00:20:31,709
Amitabh Bachchan...?

217
00:20:32,542 --> 00:20:33,709
Deewar...?

218
00:20:34,876 --> 00:20:37,751
Mr. Ranjit, yes or no?

219
00:20:46,709 --> 00:20:50,084
If I hadn't passed through
that checkpoint today...

220
00:20:50,292 --> 00:20:53,667
...then you wouldn't be still alive,
Mr. Ranjit.

221
00:20:54,709 --> 00:20:56,126
Let me guess...

222
00:20:58,501 --> 00:21:02,209
You didn't recognise me.

223
00:21:08,251 --> 00:21:11,126
A year ago...you came to Baghdad...

224
00:21:11,459 --> 00:21:15,501
...with your wife Amrita
and daughter Simran...

225
00:21:15,584 --> 00:21:17,001
...for a Fundraiser.

226
00:21:17,167 --> 00:21:21,126
And by the grace of Allah...
who was your security in-charge?

227
00:21:24,501 --> 00:21:27,167
I was with you for two days...

228
00:21:27,584 --> 00:21:30,584
...yet you don't recognise me.

229
00:21:32,042 --> 00:21:35,501
I am kind of hurt, Mr. Katiyal.

230
00:21:36,751 --> 00:21:40,251
I remember...
- No! You don't!

231
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:48,167
Successful people...
should only remember important people.

232
00:21:48,209 --> 00:21:52,334
And now...suddenly...
I am someone important.

233
00:21:52,959 --> 00:21:57,792
Mr. Khallaf Bin Zayed.
Iraqi Republican Army.

234
00:21:57,876 --> 00:22:01,001
At your service.
- Thank you.

235
00:22:01,251 --> 00:22:03,417
I'll give you plenty
of opportunities...

236
00:22:03,501 --> 00:22:05,626
...to express your gratitude.

237
00:22:05,709 --> 00:22:07,126
Like I gave him.

238
00:22:11,667 --> 00:22:12,834
Fawad?

239
00:22:13,001 --> 00:22:14,542
Fawad AI Sayyed.

240
00:22:14,626 --> 00:22:16,417
Your business partner.

241
00:22:17,334 --> 00:22:20,542
AI An Hazir Iraq, Mr. Katiyal.

242
00:22:20,876 --> 00:22:22,417
Now this is Iraq.

243
00:22:22,501 --> 00:22:24,667
And people like you...

244
00:22:25,001 --> 00:22:28,459
...will help us keep it that way.

245
00:22:29,667 --> 00:22:32,501
I'm taking another step towards that.

246
00:22:33,626 --> 00:22:36,001
A small gift.

247
00:22:36,084 --> 00:22:37,334
This sticker.

248
00:22:38,001 --> 00:22:40,501
Put it on the windshield of your car.

249
00:22:40,626 --> 00:22:42,417
It'll be helpful at checkpoints.

250
00:22:42,501 --> 00:22:46,334
Otherwise...we could
be meeting every day.

251
00:22:50,584 --> 00:22:53,376
We're friends now, Mr. Ranjit.

252
00:22:53,959 --> 00:22:55,959
If you ever need anything...

253
00:22:56,126 --> 00:22:59,459
...don't hesitate.

254
00:22:59,626 --> 00:23:02,459
In return...I’m sure
you too honor this friendship.

255
00:23:03,376 --> 00:23:05,042
You can go.

256
00:23:22,292 --> 00:23:23,042
Mr. Saini.

257
00:23:23,209 --> 00:23:23,959
Mr. Saini.

258
00:23:24,042 --> 00:23:25,876
Mr. Katiyal, over here.

259
00:23:28,042 --> 00:23:29,917
Thank God you saw me.

260
00:23:32,959 --> 00:23:34,001
It's okay.

261
00:23:34,626 --> 00:23:35,542
Brij!

262
00:23:35,709 --> 00:23:38,126
Brij! What the hell is happening?

263
00:23:38,501 --> 00:23:39,917
What happened? Calm down.

264
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:44,042
A 16 year old Iraqi
soldier shot my driver.

265
00:23:44,209 --> 00:23:46,209
They dragged me to the Dasman palace.

266
00:23:46,292 --> 00:23:47,459
I couldn't tell if...

267
00:23:47,542 --> 00:23:50,126
...that Iraqi Major
was being friendly...

268
00:23:50,209 --> 00:23:51,376
...or threatening me.

269
00:23:51,501 --> 00:23:52,459
And you're asking what happened?

270
00:23:52,542 --> 00:23:53,667
Come, sit.

271
00:23:54,501 --> 00:23:55,792
Have some water.

272
00:23:56,126 --> 00:23:57,834
We'll sort it out, don't worry.

273
00:24:13,209 --> 00:24:15,167
I am sorry.
- No, it's okay.

274
00:24:19,126 --> 00:24:20,542
What is the airport situation?

275
00:24:22,126 --> 00:24:23,834
The Iraqis have control over it.

276
00:24:24,501 --> 00:24:25,584
No one can come in.

277
00:24:25,751 --> 00:24:27,292
And there's no question of leaving.

278
00:24:27,376 --> 00:24:28,876
And the Indian Government?

279
00:24:29,167 --> 00:24:30,667
As usual, must be watching the show.

280
00:24:30,751 --> 00:24:31,626
Your Kuwaiti government...

281
00:24:31,709 --> 00:24:33,126
...didn't even wait
for the show to start.

282
00:24:33,209 --> 00:24:34,167
They fled.

283
00:24:34,584 --> 00:24:37,209
Policy decisions
are not made in hours.

284
00:24:37,917 --> 00:24:39,751
And the entire world's
watching the show.

285
00:24:42,751 --> 00:24:44,417
Brij, do something.

286
00:24:45,167 --> 00:24:47,334
Get me and my family out of here.

287
00:24:47,417 --> 00:24:48,542
We have to get out.

288
00:24:48,626 --> 00:24:50,959
Yes. And so do another 170,000 Indians.

289
00:24:51,334 --> 00:24:52,751
But how will you?

290
00:24:58,626 --> 00:25:00,917
Okay...do one thing.

291
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:03,292
Bring your family here.

292
00:25:06,959 --> 00:25:08,959
Take her.

293
00:25:50,584 --> 00:25:54,834
Look! What a fancy house!

294
00:26:19,209 --> 00:26:24,876
- Look, a Kuwaiti Teddy!
- Dead Kuwaiti Teddy!

295
00:30:02,001 --> 00:30:04,876
There's no point going home.
We'll just stay here and...

296
00:30:05,167 --> 00:30:06,626
Joseph, did anyone call from home?

297
00:30:06,709 --> 00:30:07,542
Ranjit.

298
00:30:12,626 --> 00:30:15,126
DO you know how scared I was?
- Papa!

299
00:30:15,209 --> 00:30:18,251
You have no idea how I
brought Simu in here.

300
00:30:22,501 --> 00:30:23,626
Where were you?

301
00:30:28,084 --> 00:30:30,292
Ranjit, please. Let's just leave.

302
00:30:30,501 --> 00:30:32,334
You were saying that
we should go to London.

303
00:30:32,501 --> 00:30:33,626
Let's go to London.

304
00:30:33,751 --> 00:30:35,459
Just get us out of here.
- Nair's been shot.

305
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:38,876
Are you even listening?
- Amrita, Nair's been shot.

306
00:30:39,542 --> 00:30:40,501
Nair?

307
00:30:43,084 --> 00:30:44,376
So were you at the hospital?

308
00:30:45,376 --> 00:30:46,792
How is he now?

309
00:30:53,209 --> 00:30:54,167
Ranjit.

310
00:30:55,667 --> 00:30:57,292
Ranjit.
- He's dead.

311
00:30:57,584 --> 00:30:59,334
What?
- Yeah...

312
00:31:00,501 --> 00:31:03,167
They killed him...
right in front of my eyes.

313
00:31:05,917 --> 00:31:08,251
Little kids are walking
around with guns.

314
00:31:09,959 --> 00:31:12,251
Fawad AI Sayyed was
hanging off a crane.

315
00:31:12,334 --> 00:31:15,167
Oh my...
- So what is Ranjit Katiyal worth?

316
00:31:17,209 --> 00:31:21,001
I couldn't even ask
about Nair's body.

317
00:31:23,834 --> 00:31:26,667
His wife just called.

318
00:33:31,542 --> 00:33:34,209
Mr. Ranjit, why are you standing?

319
00:33:34,417 --> 00:33:36,001
Please sit.
- Thank you.

320
00:33:36,167 --> 00:33:37,292
Not here.

321
00:33:39,334 --> 00:33:40,292
Here.

322
00:33:49,751 --> 00:33:53,542
There's a price to everything,
Mr. Ranjit.

323
00:33:54,542 --> 00:33:56,292
I am ready to pay.

324
00:33:56,876 --> 00:34:00,709
The Kuwaiti Dinar is worthless now.

325
00:34:02,584 --> 00:34:06,042
300,000 dollars for 3 people.

326
00:34:07,709 --> 00:34:09,709
We are five.
- Five?

327
00:34:09,917 --> 00:34:13,876
My driver's wife and his child.

328
00:34:14,501 --> 00:34:16,042
Driver's wife...

329
00:34:20,667 --> 00:34:23,834
This is your chance to
get out with your family.

330
00:34:24,792 --> 00:34:26,626
Don't get involved in social work...

331
00:34:26,709 --> 00:34:28,667
...you'll only get stuck further.

332
00:34:30,751 --> 00:34:32,251
I'm not the type who gets stuck.

333
00:34:32,584 --> 00:34:35,667
Anyway...l can arrange for your money.

334
00:34:36,292 --> 00:34:39,542
Very good!

335
00:34:40,501 --> 00:34:41,417
Thank you.

336
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:48,001
How much do we have?
- Earlier, there were 200.

337
00:34:48,084 --> 00:34:49,292
And now..
- I'm talking about cash.

338
00:34:49,376 --> 00:34:52,376
Sir, thank God you've come.

339
00:34:52,626 --> 00:34:54,459
It now feels like
things will get better.

340
00:34:54,542 --> 00:34:55,792
We're scared.

341
00:34:55,959 --> 00:34:58,542
Please tell us what to do.

342
00:34:58,876 --> 00:34:59,792
Sir...

343
00:35:24,042 --> 00:35:27,209
Joseph, make a list of our
staff and their families.

344
00:35:27,626 --> 00:35:29,501
See if we can accommodate
everyone here.

345
00:35:29,834 --> 00:35:31,417
Otherwise,
we'll make other arrangements.

346
00:35:32,667 --> 00:35:33,709
Relax everyone.

347
00:35:35,084 --> 00:35:36,084
Sit.

348
00:35:37,751 --> 00:35:38,626
Relax.

349
00:35:42,376 --> 00:35:43,626
What do you think you're doing?

350
00:35:43,834 --> 00:35:45,751
Why aren't you getting us out of here?

351
00:35:46,334 --> 00:35:48,876
I can't just desert them, can I?

352
00:35:49,959 --> 00:35:51,542
But you can desert us.

353
00:35:52,417 --> 00:35:55,167
Don't you have any
responsibility towards us?

354
00:35:55,542 --> 00:35:56,501
Of course I do.

355
00:35:56,959 --> 00:35:58,667
But these people work for me.

356
00:35:59,626 --> 00:36:00,834
They have the same
expectations from us...

357
00:36:00,917 --> 00:36:03,001
...as we did
the Kuwaiti government.

358
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:10,376
"How can anyone run from
their responsibilities"...

359
00:36:10,459 --> 00:36:12,126
...these were your words.
- Yes, they were.

360
00:36:12,501 --> 00:36:14,209
But it's easy to make tall claims.

361
00:36:14,459 --> 00:36:15,584
That was my mistake.

362
00:36:15,876 --> 00:36:17,542
But you're making an even bigger one.

363
00:36:17,667 --> 00:36:19,167
And why this sudden
urge to be a Messiah?

364
00:36:19,251 --> 00:36:21,584
I have no interest in being a Messiah.

365
00:36:23,209 --> 00:36:24,542
I too want to get us out of here.

366
00:36:25,459 --> 00:36:28,209
But... once I make
some arrangements for them.

367
00:36:45,917 --> 00:36:47,876
Take care of yourselves.

368
00:36:48,042 --> 00:36:50,709
Soon we'll make some arrangements.

369
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:52,334
Did you eat?

370
00:36:53,501 --> 00:36:54,751
Did you eat?

371
00:36:55,917 --> 00:36:57,417
Are you okay?

372
00:37:10,501 --> 00:37:11,709
Give me some space.

373
00:37:12,126 --> 00:37:13,501
Where do you expect me to sleep?

374
00:37:13,959 --> 00:37:15,209
Strange problem.

375
00:37:15,292 --> 00:37:16,292
Calm down.

376
00:37:16,376 --> 00:37:19,126
Isn't there enough of
a battle for space outside?

377
00:37:19,459 --> 00:37:20,501
Stop being childish.

378
00:37:20,792 --> 00:37:22,209
Come here.
Here.

379
00:37:22,292 --> 00:37:23,209
Come on.

380
00:37:24,209 --> 00:37:25,751
There's space here.

381
00:38:26,792 --> 00:38:27,751
Excuse me.

382
00:38:28,501 --> 00:38:30,251
The toilets have become very dirty.

383
00:38:31,001 --> 00:38:32,376
They're stinking.

384
00:38:33,834 --> 00:38:35,042
You're the boss, aren't you?

385
00:38:35,709 --> 00:38:37,292
That's why I am telling you.

386
00:38:37,751 --> 00:38:39,584
Do you work here?
- No!

387
00:38:42,126 --> 00:38:44,584
Let me know when it's clean.

388
00:38:45,001 --> 00:38:46,751
I'm in this room.

389
00:38:47,001 --> 00:38:49,001
Hey, move aside.

390
00:38:49,834 --> 00:38:51,001
I'm not going to be called a refugee
along with these drivers and coolies...

391
00:38:51,084 --> 00:38:53,501
- Sir, any problem?

392
00:38:54,042 --> 00:38:55,876
Who is he?
- I don't know, sir.

393
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:58,126
Around 100 more came here last night.

394
00:38:58,334 --> 00:38:59,667
There are many like him.

395
00:38:59,834 --> 00:39:02,876
More than 1000 Indians
are waiting outside.

396
00:39:04,209 --> 00:39:05,084
How did they get here?

397
00:39:05,167 --> 00:39:07,709
Sir, they say they're friends,
relatives, etcetera...

398
00:39:07,792 --> 00:39:09,334
...of our employees.

399
00:39:09,417 --> 00:39:10,376
They had nowhere to go.

400
00:39:10,501 --> 00:39:11,834
So they came here...

401
00:39:11,917 --> 00:39:14,042
...because they feel
safer when they're together.

402
00:39:16,334 --> 00:39:20,042
Sir...it's hard to arrange
food for 500 people.

403
00:39:20,376 --> 00:39:22,792
What will we do with 1600?

404
00:39:24,334 --> 00:39:26,334
If you want, I can identify
those who work for us...

405
00:39:26,417 --> 00:39:28,709
...and ask the rest to leave?

406
00:39:30,584 --> 00:39:31,459
No!

407
00:39:45,626 --> 00:39:47,167
Hello, sir.

408
00:39:48,334 --> 00:39:49,209
This way.

409
00:39:54,417 --> 00:39:56,084
Ranjit Wasn't Ranjit heading here?

410
00:39:56,834 --> 00:39:58,459
But I heard the situation
is pretty bad in the city center.

411
00:40:01,001 --> 00:40:02,417
Hello, everyone.
- Hello.

412
00:40:02,584 --> 00:40:04,126
Hey, Ranjit.
- He's here.

413
00:40:04,251 --> 00:40:05,001
How are you?

414
00:40:05,667 --> 00:40:06,501
Thank you.

415
00:40:07,376 --> 00:40:09,792
Ranjit, you too?
In the day?

416
00:40:09,959 --> 00:40:12,542
Saddam has turned
everything on its head.

417
00:40:14,042 --> 00:40:16,626
Ranjit, when all
this is over tomorrow...

418
00:40:16,959 --> 00:40:20,292
...you'll have an exciting
story to tell your grandchildren.

419
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:23,917
Like "When uncle Saddam
was swirling Kuwait around..."

420
00:40:24,167 --> 00:40:27,709
"...l was swirling a glass of
scotch in Kurien uncle's supermarket".

421
00:40:28,417 --> 00:40:30,542
So it'll all be over tomorrow?
- Of course, Ranjit.

422
00:40:30,626 --> 00:40:32,167
You think America will stay quiet?

423
00:40:32,292 --> 00:40:33,751
So what is America waiting for?

424
00:40:33,917 --> 00:40:35,667
For us to finish our scotch.

425
00:40:36,001 --> 00:40:37,251
Calm down, Ranjit.

426
00:40:37,584 --> 00:40:39,209
They'll keep us afraid of
the villain for a couple of days.

427
00:40:39,292 --> 00:40:42,167
Then tell the Arabs,
'look at what happened to Kuwait.'

428
00:40:42,251 --> 00:40:44,334
'Let us in...build a military base.'

429
00:40:44,417 --> 00:40:45,376
'And we'll keep you safe.'

430
00:40:45,501 --> 00:40:47,292
And everything will
be back to business.

431
00:40:47,376 --> 00:40:48,709
It's a question of a few days.

432
00:40:49,376 --> 00:40:52,209
So gentlemen, this is everything.

433
00:40:52,292 --> 00:40:54,042
You guys can take what you want.

434
00:40:54,209 --> 00:40:54,917
Ranjit.

435
00:40:55,084 --> 00:40:56,709
Ibrahim.
- Yes, sir.

436
00:40:56,792 --> 00:40:59,792
Ranjit sir...I’m sure
you haven't brought a truck.

437
00:41:00,042 --> 00:41:01,584
So Ibrahim will load up...

438
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:03,417
...and deliver it to your office.

439
00:41:03,792 --> 00:41:05,209
Tell me something...

440
00:41:06,584 --> 00:41:09,292
Why are we dividing all the food?

441
00:41:11,917 --> 00:41:15,084
Why don't we all
gather at one place...

442
00:41:15,167 --> 00:41:17,209
...and take all the stuff there.

443
00:41:18,001 --> 00:41:20,542
You know,
if we Indians stay together...

444
00:41:21,876 --> 00:41:24,001
What happened?
- We Indians?

445
00:41:24,167 --> 00:41:25,126
Oh, come on!

446
00:41:25,209 --> 00:41:26,876
Since when did you
become an Indian, Ranjit?

447
00:41:27,084 --> 00:41:28,542
Weren't you always a Kuwaiti.

448
00:41:29,584 --> 00:41:32,751
Ranjit, let's just take the
first flight out of here.

449
00:41:33,126 --> 00:41:34,334
Saddam has attacked them.

450
00:41:34,417 --> 00:41:35,542
Why should we be bothered?

451
00:41:35,626 --> 00:41:37,042
What's the bother?

452
00:41:37,667 --> 00:41:39,917
All we need is a big space,
that's all.

453
00:41:40,584 --> 00:41:42,501
It's a question of
couple of days, Ranjit.

454
00:41:43,084 --> 00:41:45,251
What's the problem?
- Hold on.

455
00:41:46,917 --> 00:41:49,917
Ranjit is right.
- Let's solve our own problems.

456
00:41:50,542 --> 00:41:52,626
Trying to help 170,000...

457
00:41:52,959 --> 00:41:55,667
...will only add to our problems.

458
00:41:57,751 --> 00:41:59,084
Come on, Ibrahim.

459
00:42:01,126 --> 00:42:02,084
Ashok...

460
00:42:04,959 --> 00:42:07,042
...outside of this supermarket...

461
00:42:07,376 --> 00:42:09,542
nobody recognizes you or me.

462
00:42:10,209 --> 00:42:12,001
We have no standing.

463
00:42:12,959 --> 00:42:15,042
The only thing we
have is our identity.

464
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:17,334
We're Indian, not Kuwaiti.

465
00:42:18,917 --> 00:42:21,542
Together we're something...

466
00:42:22,542 --> 00:42:23,542
If not...

467
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:25,751
Nothing!

468
00:42:34,459 --> 00:42:38,459
It's old whiskey... but not
worth 500,000 dollars, Mr. Ranjit.

469
00:42:42,751 --> 00:42:44,126
I did try to tell you...

470
00:42:44,292 --> 00:42:47,334
Getting involved
in social work is a trap.

471
00:42:49,417 --> 00:42:50,834
That's not it, sir.

472
00:42:51,126 --> 00:42:52,167
Once the camp is set up...

473
00:42:52,251 --> 00:42:54,459
...I'll leave with my wife and child.

474
00:42:54,917 --> 00:42:56,751
As long as you're with us.

475
00:42:56,834 --> 00:43:00,626
Aah...you're trying to flatter me.

476
00:43:02,959 --> 00:43:06,209
Even the President considers
Indians as friends.

477
00:43:06,876 --> 00:43:08,792
You can setup camp anywhere you want.

478
00:43:08,959 --> 00:43:11,251
You have my permission.
- Thank you.

479
00:43:12,001 --> 00:43:15,709
But why take your family to the camp?

480
00:43:17,126 --> 00:43:19,917
Tell your wife it's safe at home.

481
00:43:20,292 --> 00:43:22,459
You have my word.

482
00:43:22,542 --> 00:43:23,584
Thank you.

483
00:43:39,042 --> 00:43:40,459
Move.

484
00:44:02,959 --> 00:44:03,751
Come on.

485
00:44:06,459 --> 00:44:07,417
Excuse me.

486
00:44:42,126 --> 00:44:43,501
There are classrooms at the back.

487
00:44:43,584 --> 00:44:44,667
You can sleep there.

488
00:44:45,292 --> 00:44:46,501
There are bathrooms here too.

489
00:44:47,042 --> 00:44:49,626
There's water available
here.

490
00:44:51,292 --> 00:44:52,834
And Ashok's trying to find out.

491
00:44:53,792 --> 00:44:55,959
You see...we can put up tents here...

492
00:44:56,042 --> 00:44:57,667
...and let people sleep.

493
00:44:57,751 --> 00:44:58,417
Why not.

494
00:44:58,501 --> 00:44:59,959
Ranjit.
- Yes, Ashok.

495
00:45:00,042 --> 00:45:02,792
The canteen's on that side.
We can serve them meals in there.

496
00:45:22,292 --> 00:45:24,626
Simu, out of the bus!

497
00:45:25,626 --> 00:45:28,084
I told you to stay right here!

498
00:45:28,167 --> 00:45:29,209
Come on.

499
00:45:30,001 --> 00:45:31,042
Come here.

500
00:45:32,792 --> 00:45:35,376
You can stay here.

501
00:45:36,917 --> 00:45:39,417
This is my "199399-

502
00:45:40,084 --> 00:45:41,917
What do you mean by that?

503
00:45:44,667 --> 00:45:48,001
This is my room.
- No, we'll shift to some other room.

504
00:45:48,667 --> 00:45:52,959
It should be first come, first served.

505
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:54,626
I saw it first.

506
00:45:54,709 --> 00:45:56,084
What do you think this is...

507
00:45:56,167 --> 00:45:57,667
'finders keepers'?

508
00:45:57,876 --> 00:46:00,209
We'll go..
- No, no, not at all.

509
00:46:00,292 --> 00:46:03,667
If she's okay...

510
00:46:10,209 --> 00:46:11,667
Nonsense!

511
00:46:13,084 --> 00:46:14,084
Come here.

512
00:46:22,001 --> 00:46:23,292
Come on, let's go.
- No!

513
00:46:23,334 --> 00:46:25,542
We won't stay here.

514
00:46:26,209 --> 00:46:27,292
We'll all be together here.

515
00:46:27,376 --> 00:46:28,126
It'll be safe.

516
00:46:28,209 --> 00:46:29,167
Safe!

517
00:46:29,542 --> 00:46:32,251
I found Simu playing with this!
A bullet!

518
00:46:33,917 --> 00:46:35,834
You can help them settle down,
if you want.

519
00:46:35,917 --> 00:46:37,709
Don't involve us.

520
00:46:38,376 --> 00:46:39,626
Amrita...

521
00:46:40,042 --> 00:46:42,751
When you're ready,
pick us up from home.

522
00:46:43,084 --> 00:46:45,417
The Major has guaranteed
our safety, hasn't he?

523
00:46:47,709 --> 00:46:48,917
I'm leaving.

524
00:46:51,584 --> 00:46:52,626
Are you coming?

525
00:46:56,417 --> 00:46:57,709
Okay, sit.

526
00:47:04,876 --> 00:47:06,084
I'll drop her home.
- Okay.

527
00:47:06,167 --> 00:47:08,001
Take care of things.

528
00:47:20,584 --> 00:47:21,709
What are you doing?

529
00:47:22,959 --> 00:47:25,251
Get lost.

530
00:47:25,876 --> 00:47:26,917
Get lost.

531
00:47:28,709 --> 00:47:30,334
Is this a picnic?

532
00:47:31,792 --> 00:47:32,917
There's a war going on...

533
00:47:33,001 --> 00:47:34,542
Do you have any sense?

534
00:47:35,084 --> 00:47:36,709
No discipline at all.

535
00:47:36,792 --> 00:47:38,001
Look at him screaming.

536
00:47:38,084 --> 00:47:39,042
Who's that?

537
00:47:39,334 --> 00:47:41,126
It can be only one guy?
- Who?

538
00:47:41,501 --> 00:47:42,459
My husband.

539
00:47:49,959 --> 00:47:51,501
Let me take him...

540
00:47:51,542 --> 00:47:54,042
While you eat something.

541
00:47:59,251 --> 00:48:01,959
I'll take it... We'll eat later.

542
00:48:19,334 --> 00:48:20,542
Ashok, we've finished our scotch...

543
00:48:20,626 --> 00:48:22,084
Where is America?

544
00:48:22,167 --> 00:48:24,209
Forget America...Where's India?

545
00:48:25,042 --> 00:48:26,917
Around 150,000 Indians are stuck here.

546
00:48:27,001 --> 00:48:28,459
Is anyone concerned?

547
00:48:28,834 --> 00:48:30,167
They haven't done anything for us.

548
00:48:30,251 --> 00:48:32,084
It's not like we've done anything
for India either.

549
00:48:32,167 --> 00:48:35,251
You might
not have done anything.

550
00:48:35,334 --> 00:48:37,542
We send millions of Dinar to India.

551
00:48:38,126 --> 00:48:41,084
They want our Dinar...

552
00:48:42,001 --> 00:48:43,501
...but they don't care about our lives.

553
00:48:44,292 --> 00:48:47,417
If this had
been a western country...

554
00:48:47,626 --> 00:48:50,001
...their embassy would've
gotten their people out by now.

555
00:48:50,084 --> 00:48:51,876
The embassy can do something...

556
00:48:51,959 --> 00:48:53,834
...only if they know
that we've setup a camp.

557
00:48:53,917 --> 00:48:56,334
How will they find out? When we..
- What's this?

558
00:48:57,417 --> 00:48:59,501
There's no discipline in the camp.

559
00:49:03,084 --> 00:49:03,959
What?

560
00:49:04,834 --> 00:49:06,001
Didn't you hear?

561
00:49:07,251 --> 00:49:08,459
I heard.

562
00:49:08,792 --> 00:49:10,001
Good.

563
00:49:17,917 --> 00:49:19,292
Let's go to the embassy.

564
00:49:34,209 --> 00:49:35,917
Kurien, look there.
- Yes.

565
00:49:42,501 --> 00:49:44,542
Where's everyone?
- Gone.

566
00:49:44,709 --> 00:49:45,542
Gone?

567
00:49:45,626 --> 00:49:47,001
Where's Brij?

568
00:49:47,292 --> 00:49:48,959
The entire embassy has been evacuated.

569
00:49:49,167 --> 00:49:50,292
I'm leaving too.

570
00:49:50,667 --> 00:49:53,209
Saddam says there's no point in
having two embassies in one country.

571
00:49:53,376 --> 00:49:54,751
All the embassies
are in Baghdad anyway.

572
00:49:54,834 --> 00:49:57,584
So will all the Indians
go to Baghdad now?

573
00:49:57,667 --> 00:49:59,751
No point yelling at me.

574
00:49:59,834 --> 00:50:01,542
Talk to the External
Affairs Ministry in Delhi.

575
00:50:01,626 --> 00:50:02,959
They'll tell you
what Indians should do.

576
00:50:03,042 --> 00:50:05,084
What nonsense..
- Wait. Wait.

577
00:50:05,292 --> 00:50:06,376
Do you have any number?

578
00:50:06,459 --> 00:50:08,001
Someone we can call?

579
00:50:17,834 --> 00:50:19,417
Mr. Mishra, come.

580
00:50:20,042 --> 00:50:21,084
Come on.

581
00:50:53,251 --> 00:50:55,542
Hello, Ministry of External Affairs.

582
00:50:55,709 --> 00:50:59,126
This is Ranjit Katiyal
speaking from Kuwait city.

583
00:50:59,209 --> 00:50:59,959
Yes.

584
00:51:00,042 --> 00:51:02,167
We've been given a few numbers...

585
00:51:02,334 --> 00:51:04,167
By the way, who is this?

586
00:51:04,334 --> 00:51:07,126
Joint Secretary, Sanjeev Kohli.

587
00:51:07,209 --> 00:51:09,209
I wanted to talk to you about...

588
00:51:09,292 --> 00:51:11,667
...the situation of
Indians living in Kuwait.

589
00:51:11,751 --> 00:51:14,792
We Indians have setup
camp in Apex School...

590
00:51:14,917 --> 00:51:17,959
Look,
I don't handle the Gulf Division.

591
00:51:18,167 --> 00:51:20,459
You've been given the wrong number.

592
00:51:20,542 --> 00:51:22,917
Look Mr. Kohli, we need help.

593
00:51:23,001 --> 00:51:25,167
And we need it right now.

594
00:51:25,834 --> 00:51:26,834
Well...

595
00:51:29,084 --> 00:51:31,709
I'll communicate this...

596
00:51:31,792 --> 00:51:34,792
...to the Joint
Secretary of the Gulf division.

597
00:51:34,876 --> 00:51:37,542
Give me the number to your school.

598
00:51:39,917 --> 00:51:40,917
For two ?

599
00:51:43,626 --> 00:51:45,376
Green chilly?

600
00:51:45,626 --> 00:51:47,001
No, thanks.

601
00:51:47,209 --> 00:51:48,501
Meher! Meher!

602
00:51:51,709 --> 00:51:53,209
This is where we're going to live?

603
00:51:53,334 --> 00:51:54,751
With these people?

604
00:51:55,126 --> 00:51:56,792
I'm leaving!
- Dad!

605
00:51:57,167 --> 00:51:59,209
They are killing people outside.

606
00:51:59,542 --> 00:52:01,292
Meher, Saddam has guaranteed...

607
00:52:01,376 --> 00:52:03,876
...that Iraqis won't hurt Indians.

608
00:52:03,959 --> 00:52:04,834
How would they know...

609
00:52:04,917 --> 00:52:06,251
...who's Kuwaiti, who's Indian?

610
00:52:06,334 --> 00:52:08,501
Meher...The bank has
my entire life's savings...

611
00:52:08,584 --> 00:52:09,709
...not yours!

612
00:52:12,501 --> 00:52:13,626
I'm leaving!

613
00:52:20,959 --> 00:52:22,167
It's okay, dear.

614
00:52:22,251 --> 00:52:23,542
It'll be okay.

615
00:52:27,334 --> 00:52:28,709
Let me do it.

616
00:52:29,167 --> 00:52:30,459
Can I tie that for you.

617
00:52:30,834 --> 00:52:32,292
Allow me...

618
00:52:33,042 --> 00:52:34,042
What?

619
00:52:35,501 --> 00:52:36,542
What did you say?

620
00:52:36,626 --> 00:52:38,167
Are you Kuwaiti?

621
00:52:47,584 --> 00:52:49,001
You go ahead.

622
00:52:52,084 --> 00:52:53,667
Sheer insensitivity.

623
00:52:54,001 --> 00:52:57,209
There's no communication from
the External Ministry yet.

624
00:52:57,334 --> 00:52:58,792
While taking our number...
- Papa!

625
00:52:58,959 --> 00:53:01,376
My sweetie-pie.

626
00:53:01,959 --> 00:53:03,626
Hello, stranger.

627
00:53:05,292 --> 00:53:07,959
This is the first nice
surprise after 2nd August.

628
00:53:08,626 --> 00:53:10,251
You hardly ever come home.

629
00:53:10,626 --> 00:53:12,792
So I have to bring Simu
here to see her father, don't I?

630
00:53:13,917 --> 00:53:14,959
Thank you.

631
00:53:17,417 --> 00:53:18,917
What's going on?

632
00:53:20,042 --> 00:53:21,709
Nothing much. We've been trying to
reach the External Affairs Ministry...

633
00:53:21,792 --> 00:53:23,334
...in Delhi for four days,
but haven't managed to.

634
00:53:23,917 --> 00:53:24,792
Hello, ma'am.

635
00:53:24,917 --> 00:53:25,709
How are you?
- Fine.

636
00:53:25,792 --> 00:53:26,292
Yes.

637
00:53:26,376 --> 00:53:27,376
Come, Simu.

638
00:53:27,459 --> 00:53:29,251
I'll show you something really nice.

639
00:53:29,334 --> 00:53:30,292
I've kept it aside for you.

640
00:53:30,376 --> 00:53:32,917
Are you enjoying all this?
- What?

641
00:53:33,001 --> 00:53:36,501
I have no idea when you come or go.

642
00:53:37,626 --> 00:53:39,917
I'm trying to sort all this.

643
00:53:40,084 --> 00:53:42,084
Our people..
- Our people?

644
00:53:42,876 --> 00:53:44,376
Our people?

645
00:53:45,501 --> 00:53:48,501
Calling Delhi every day,
playing Indian Indian...

646
00:53:48,959 --> 00:53:50,667
Since when did you
start caring so much about them?

647
00:53:50,917 --> 00:53:53,209
Whenever I spoke about
going to India... - Amrita.

648
00:53:53,292 --> 00:53:57,501
Amrita, once we have some clarity
from Delhi about the status of our people...

649
00:53:57,584 --> 00:53:59,417
...we'll get out of here.

650
00:53:59,501 --> 00:54:00,917
Hello, ma'am.
- Yeah.

651
00:54:04,292 --> 00:54:06,209
Will you answer one question?

652
00:54:06,584 --> 00:54:08,042
And I'm not asking in anger.

653
00:54:08,626 --> 00:54:10,917
Why? Why all this?

654
00:54:11,292 --> 00:54:12,209
Why this charade?

655
00:54:12,292 --> 00:54:16,751
And what are you
suddenly trying to be?

656
00:54:17,084 --> 00:54:18,209
Ranjit?

657
00:54:23,251 --> 00:54:25,584
Look at these people.
- Why?

658
00:54:26,084 --> 00:54:27,501
Amrita, look at them.

659
00:54:29,626 --> 00:54:32,126
Some of them have been
working in our office...

660
00:54:32,209 --> 00:54:34,334
...for 5...10...12 years.

661
00:54:35,167 --> 00:54:37,292
But I didn't even know their names.

662
00:54:38,376 --> 00:54:41,334
Unfortunately, now I do.

663
00:54:43,584 --> 00:54:45,042
If we walk away...

664
00:54:46,126 --> 00:54:47,959
...we will be leaving these
names behind, not just any crowd.

665
00:54:49,001 --> 00:54:51,751
It's true, they're not related to us.

666
00:54:52,917 --> 00:54:54,751
But neither was Nair.

667
00:54:56,417 --> 00:54:58,001
And he lost his life.

668
00:54:58,417 --> 00:55:00,709
And it's not like I'm giving up
my life for these people.

669
00:55:03,459 --> 00:55:06,584
If I turn away now, won't you ask...

670
00:55:07,126 --> 00:55:09,417
"Ranjit, what kind of a man are you?"

671
00:55:12,417 --> 00:55:13,834
Ranjit!

672
00:55:19,959 --> 00:55:22,001
Sir, we're Indians.

673
00:55:22,209 --> 00:55:23,959
We have permission.

674
00:55:25,209 --> 00:55:26,709
We have permission.

675
00:55:28,084 --> 00:55:29,167
Run! Run!

676
00:55:30,292 --> 00:55:32,251
They're coming!

677
00:55:32,917 --> 00:55:33,959
Run!

678
00:56:01,167 --> 00:56:05,417
Ismail, Mani. Go hide the food.
- Okay.

679
00:58:11,667 --> 00:58:13,834
Good to see you, Mr. Ranjit.

680
00:58:14,167 --> 00:58:16,834
Where's my whiskey today?

681
00:58:19,501 --> 00:58:21,126
Your soldiers came...

682
00:58:21,209 --> 00:58:22,834
They looted our camp.

683
00:58:23,084 --> 00:58:24,334
I am sorry.

684
00:58:24,542 --> 00:58:26,334
But what can they do?

685
00:58:26,501 --> 00:58:28,667
Baghdad sent us...

686
00:58:28,751 --> 00:58:31,167
...but forgot our supplies.

687
00:58:31,334 --> 00:58:34,501
They thought we could depend
on your hospitality.

688
00:58:34,751 --> 00:58:37,376
But... why are you so worried?

689
00:58:37,584 --> 00:58:40,084
It's not like they
really did anything to you.

690
00:58:40,167 --> 00:58:41,084
Did they?

691
00:58:41,167 --> 00:58:42,542
Maybe they will come back.

692
00:58:42,626 --> 00:58:43,751
I can't stop them.

693
00:58:43,834 --> 00:58:45,917
How do I ensure the
safety of my people?

694
00:58:46,834 --> 00:58:49,834
Ranjit! Ranjit! Ranjit!

695
00:58:50,126 --> 00:58:54,084
Now I know for sure you're trapped.

696
00:58:54,459 --> 00:58:57,584
You can all leave Kuwait
anytime if you want.

697
00:58:58,042 --> 00:59:01,376
The President, like me, is
a friend of Indians.

698
00:59:01,542 --> 00:59:03,167
And he has already permitted...

699
00:59:03,251 --> 00:59:04,126
...Indians to leave.

700
00:59:04,209 --> 00:59:08,667
You never told me that.
- You never asked.

701
00:59:08,792 --> 00:59:10,417
And that's why you never told me?

702
00:59:12,001 --> 00:59:13,417
May Allah be with you.

703
00:59:19,584 --> 00:59:22,126
But Ranjit...tell me..

704
00:59:23,001 --> 00:59:26,209
Where will you go
with all these people?

705
00:59:30,167 --> 00:59:30,667
Yes, sir?

706
00:59:30,751 --> 00:59:32,709
Joseph.
My medicines are almost over.

707
00:59:33,042 --> 00:59:34,501
I'll look into it, sir.

708
00:59:34,584 --> 00:59:37,459
What if the soldiers come back?

709
00:59:37,542 --> 00:59:38,584
There's nothing we can do, sir.

710
00:59:38,667 --> 00:59:40,251
Joseph.
- Yes, sir.

711
00:59:40,542 --> 00:59:41,626
Excuse me.

712
00:59:42,376 --> 00:59:43,459
Make a list...

713
00:59:44,084 --> 00:59:45,251
...of the people here.

714
00:59:45,334 --> 00:59:46,209
Write down all their names.

715
00:59:46,417 --> 00:59:47,709
We should know how
many people are here.

716
00:59:48,501 --> 00:59:49,709
And what are we doing about food now?

717
00:59:49,792 --> 00:59:51,751
Sir, we still have food for 2-3 days.

718
00:59:51,834 --> 00:59:55,084
Ibrahim managed
to hide half the food.

719
00:59:57,001 --> 00:59:59,001
Thank God.
Well, that's good.

720
00:59:59,542 --> 01:00:01,876
But why are you calling me?

721
01:00:02,042 --> 01:00:04,709
I already passed on
the number to the Gulf Desk.

722
01:00:04,917 --> 01:00:06,501
Sir, no one has called
from the Ministry yet.

723
01:00:06,584 --> 01:00:07,917
And they probably never will.

724
01:00:08,001 --> 01:00:10,209
I need your help.
- What?

725
01:00:10,292 --> 01:00:13,376
Look, Saddam Hussain has permitted...

726
01:00:13,459 --> 01:00:15,542
...us Indians to get out of Kuwait.

727
01:00:15,917 --> 01:00:18,167
But we don't know where to go...

728
01:00:18,251 --> 01:00:19,042
...when or how?

729
01:00:19,126 --> 01:00:21,876
If you could help us,
then it'll be really great.

730
01:00:21,959 --> 01:00:25,459
Let me speak to the
Minister and call you back.

731
01:00:28,209 --> 01:00:29,084
Excuse me, sir.

732
01:00:29,167 --> 01:00:29,959
Yes, Kohli.

733
01:00:30,042 --> 01:00:32,459
Those Indians stuck in Kuwait...

734
01:00:32,501 --> 01:00:34,876
Talk to Sharma at the Gulf Desk.

735
01:00:34,959 --> 01:00:37,584
Sir, if you could just
put in a word. - Kohli!

736
01:00:37,667 --> 01:00:40,251
The Prime Minister's waiting for me.

737
01:00:42,876 --> 01:00:44,834
Father's name, Vasudevan.

738
01:00:45,209 --> 01:00:46,376
Trichur.

739
01:00:46,459 --> 01:00:47,959
Okay, please.

740
01:00:48,042 --> 01:00:49,167
Next.

741
01:00:49,959 --> 01:00:53,459
Father's name, Amit.

742
01:00:54,667 --> 01:00:56,042
Look.

743
01:00:58,501 --> 01:01:00,459
We must tell sir now.

744
01:01:05,667 --> 01:01:07,667
Ibrahim, have you lost your mind?

745
01:01:08,501 --> 01:01:10,209
You shouldn't have
hidden this from me!

746
01:01:10,876 --> 01:01:13,667
If those Iraqi soldiers
had found out...

747
01:01:14,334 --> 01:01:15,959
...that she's a Kuwaiti.

748
01:01:17,376 --> 01:01:19,959
They would've shot
everyone in the camp.

749
01:01:22,001 --> 01:01:24,001
Sir, I didn't think about that.

750
01:01:24,251 --> 01:01:27,667
I only thought about what
they would've done to her.

751
01:01:34,084 --> 01:01:35,292
But honestly, sir...

752
01:01:35,834 --> 01:01:39,501
...what is the proof
that we're not Kuwaiti.

753
01:01:40,209 --> 01:01:43,001
Most of them don't have any documents.

754
01:01:43,459 --> 01:01:45,501
Agents have their passports.

755
01:01:45,834 --> 01:01:47,709
Who will believe we're Indian?

756
01:01:57,792 --> 01:01:59,251
Mr. Ranjit Katiyal.

757
01:01:59,501 --> 01:02:02,251
Look, I couldn't find out much.

758
01:02:02,334 --> 01:02:04,126
But I was informed
by the Gulf Division that...

759
01:02:04,209 --> 01:02:07,334
...you could possibly go to Jordan.

760
01:02:08,292 --> 01:02:09,334
Possibly?

761
01:02:10,751 --> 01:02:15,042
But Mr. Kohli,
many of us don't have passports.

762
01:02:15,251 --> 01:02:18,792
What do we do?
- I don't know about that.

763
01:02:19,126 --> 01:02:20,376
But...

764
01:02:21,417 --> 01:02:23,667
DO you have any contacts in Baghdad?

765
01:02:24,542 --> 01:02:25,709
Are you crazy?

766
01:02:26,917 --> 01:02:28,126
He'll go to Iraq?

767
01:02:29,042 --> 01:02:30,334
Do you think it's a picnic?

768
01:02:31,042 --> 01:02:33,251
Those boy soldiers,
who haven't even reached puberty...

769
01:02:33,376 --> 01:02:34,292
Crazy!

770
01:02:34,626 --> 01:02:36,792
Ashok, what choice do we have?

771
01:02:37,167 --> 01:02:40,084
You said that so easily
but what choice do we have?

772
01:02:41,334 --> 01:02:43,126
Those crazy Iraqis
can come back anytime.

773
01:02:43,209 --> 01:02:44,667
They can blow up
our school.

774
01:02:44,751 --> 01:02:45,834
And what can we do?

775
01:02:46,251 --> 01:02:48,376
Isn't it better that I go to Baghdad?

776
01:02:48,459 --> 01:02:51,042
...Talk to some people.
I know some people.

777
01:02:51,292 --> 01:02:52,751
We must do something.

778
01:02:53,042 --> 01:02:55,209
We can't just sit here
with our hands tied.

779
01:03:02,292 --> 01:03:04,251
Sir, there's a hospital up ahead.

780
01:03:04,792 --> 01:03:06,292
Can we stop there for a minute...

781
01:03:06,501 --> 01:03:08,626
If you don't mind...

782
01:03:09,667 --> 01:03:10,501
Thank you.

783
01:03:53,417 --> 01:03:55,251
Sorry for the trouble, sir.

784
01:03:55,334 --> 01:03:57,126
Come on, let's get out of here.

785
01:04:41,626 --> 01:04:42,251
<i>Paper.</i>

786
01:04:42,376 --> 01:04:43,501
<i>Paper.</i>

787
01:04:44,334 --> 01:04:45,959
Indian. Indian.

788
01:04:46,626 --> 01:04:48,042
Sticker!

789
01:04:52,917 --> 01:04:54,959
How did he get this?

790
01:04:55,501 --> 01:04:56,584
Okay, let him go!

791
01:04:56,792 --> 01:04:58,459
Open the way!

792
01:04:59,376 --> 01:05:02,001
- Go! Go!
- Thank you!

793
01:05:17,626 --> 01:05:19,251
Is someone at the hospital?

794
01:05:20,501 --> 01:05:22,626
I got married 8 days ago.

795
01:05:23,334 --> 01:05:25,792
My bride's name is Shazin.

796
01:05:26,626 --> 01:05:28,251
The ceremony was
to be two days later...

797
01:05:28,334 --> 01:05:30,042
...along with the send-off.

798
01:05:30,459 --> 01:05:33,917
But...Saddam sent
his cavalry that night.

799
01:05:35,584 --> 01:05:38,792
Shazin is a nurse at the hospital.

800
01:05:39,292 --> 01:05:41,501
And she's been busy
at the hospital since then?

801
01:05:41,626 --> 01:05:42,876
No, sir. She's not at the hospital...

802
01:05:42,959 --> 01:05:45,209
...nor was she at home.

803
01:05:45,501 --> 01:05:47,667
I've been looking for her...

804
01:05:47,917 --> 01:05:49,667
...but I haven't
found any trace of her.

805
01:06:04,834 --> 01:06:07,626
Don't go, Ranjit. It's not safe.

806
01:06:09,792 --> 01:06:12,501
Why don't you understand
me these days?

807
01:06:13,001 --> 01:06:16,667
Neither of us understands the other.

808
01:06:17,626 --> 01:06:20,959
It's the circumstances
that are wrong... Not us.

809
01:06:21,292 --> 01:06:26,542
"L am going to love you so much."

810
01:06:27,584 --> 01:06:33,251
"I'm going to love
you 100 times in a moment."

811
01:06:34,042 --> 01:06:39,959
"if you ever live me."

812
01:06:40,209 --> 01:06:45,542
"I will only wait for death."

813
01:06:46,042 --> 01:06:49,126
"I've forsaken the world for you."

814
01:06:49,376 --> 01:06:52,376
"My breath stops on you."

815
01:06:52,501 --> 01:06:55,167
"I love you so much."

816
01:06:55,542 --> 01:06:58,626
"You can never imagine."

817
01:06:58,834 --> 01:07:01,876
"I've forsaken the world for you."

818
01:07:02,084 --> 01:07:05,001
"My breath stops on you."

819
01:07:05,084 --> 01:07:07,959
"I love you so much."

820
01:07:08,251 --> 01:07:12,334
"You can never imagine."

821
01:07:17,876 --> 01:07:19,959
Sir, we've
setup camp in a school...

822
01:07:20,042 --> 01:07:21,459
You haven't tried it yet.

823
01:07:21,876 --> 01:07:22,917
Have some...

824
01:07:23,001 --> 01:07:24,667
It's called Kleicha.

825
01:07:25,292 --> 01:07:27,501
It's considered Iraq's
national biscuit.

826
01:07:28,917 --> 01:07:30,542
I am talking about my problem..

827
01:07:30,626 --> 01:07:32,959
I've heard a lot
about this boy lately.

828
01:07:33,292 --> 01:07:35,334
But he made only 10
runs in the first innings...

829
01:07:35,417 --> 01:07:36,667
...and then 27 in the second.

830
01:07:37,751 --> 01:07:39,917
I think the selectors
don't have a clue.

831
01:07:40,209 --> 01:07:42,501
I mean...they put anyone
in the Indian team.

832
01:07:42,584 --> 01:07:45,251
Look, I'm not here
for your biscuits...

833
01:07:45,334 --> 01:07:47,209
...nor to discuss anyone's future...

834
01:07:47,334 --> 01:07:49,459
...on the Indian cricket team.

835
01:07:49,667 --> 01:07:53,459
We're all trapped in a
war-zone in a foreign country.

836
01:07:53,542 --> 01:07:56,959
And you are... - I am trying
to change the subject, Mr. Katiyal...

837
01:07:57,126 --> 01:07:59,917
...because I know what you're facing.

838
01:08:00,417 --> 01:08:02,626
I have no interest in hassling you.

839
01:08:04,459 --> 01:08:05,876
How would we know if...

840
01:08:05,959 --> 01:08:09,292
...everyone in your camp is Indian.

841
01:08:09,417 --> 01:08:11,917
What if they turn out to
be Pakistani or Bangladeshi?

842
01:08:13,292 --> 01:08:15,501
We can't issue them passports, can we?

843
01:08:22,209 --> 01:08:23,501
I get it.

844
01:08:24,126 --> 01:08:25,209
Thank you.

845
01:08:25,459 --> 01:08:27,209
Sorry, Mr. Katiyal.

846
01:08:27,292 --> 01:08:29,501
All I can offer you is this Kleicha.

847
01:08:30,959 --> 01:08:32,209
Please take one.

848
01:08:32,917 --> 01:08:34,126
At least take one.

849
01:08:40,709 --> 01:08:41,792
Sir, anything?

850
01:08:44,001 --> 01:08:46,001
Iraqi biscuit. Kleicha.

851
01:09:01,126 --> 01:09:05,001
It doesn't feel like these
are the guys who just attacked Kuwait.

852
01:09:13,292 --> 01:09:14,542
Thank you.

853
01:09:15,167 --> 01:09:16,501
What now, sir?

854
01:09:16,917 --> 01:09:18,792
DO we even matter to Delhi?

855
01:09:19,001 --> 01:09:20,792
We matter to ourselves.

856
01:09:21,334 --> 01:09:23,501
We'll have to keep trying, what else?

857
01:09:24,376 --> 01:09:26,459
We can't blame Delhi either.

858
01:09:26,834 --> 01:09:27,917
There are many here...

859
01:09:28,042 --> 01:09:29,792
...who didn't care
about Delhi until now.

860
01:09:30,251 --> 01:09:31,959
They thought they were Kuwaiti.

861
01:09:35,917 --> 01:09:37,917
That's human nature, Ibrahim.

862
01:09:38,209 --> 01:09:41,084
When you're hurt,
you first call out to your mother.

863
01:09:43,542 --> 01:09:45,376
I'll go call Kurien.

864
01:09:47,667 --> 01:09:48,626
Yes, Kurien.

865
01:09:50,459 --> 01:09:52,167
Nothing. Kuwaitis were of no help.

866
01:09:52,251 --> 01:09:53,501
Just as the Indians weren't.

867
01:09:53,792 --> 01:09:55,209
That leaves us with just one option.

868
01:09:55,417 --> 01:09:56,584
I know some Iraqis.

869
01:09:56,917 --> 01:09:58,584
I'll try asking them for help...

870
01:09:58,876 --> 01:10:02,667
...to meet Saddam's
Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz.

871
01:10:04,376 --> 01:10:05,376
Mr. Katiyal.

872
01:10:05,876 --> 01:10:07,584
Hello.
- Hello.

873
01:10:09,792 --> 01:10:10,959
Please.
- Thank you.

874
01:10:13,959 --> 01:10:16,376
Would you like some tea?
- No. Thank you.

875
01:10:17,751 --> 01:10:20,376
Have some.
- Thank you.

876
01:10:25,001 --> 01:10:28,667
Mr. Katiyal,
this is what I can do for you.

877
01:10:30,001 --> 01:10:32,001
There's a ship called Tipu Sultan...

878
01:10:32,209 --> 01:10:33,542
...coming from India.

879
01:10:33,917 --> 01:10:37,501
With 10,000 tons of food
and medical supplies for Iraq.

880
01:10:38,709 --> 01:10:40,376
Indians have been good...

881
01:10:41,084 --> 01:10:43,126
...when the whole
world was against us.

882
01:10:44,501 --> 01:10:47,167
I can allow the Indians in Kuwait...

883
01:10:47,251 --> 01:10:49,251
...to go on their ship back home.

884
01:10:50,292 --> 01:10:51,167
Thank you.

885
01:10:52,292 --> 01:10:53,626
Thank you, Mr. Aziz.

886
01:10:54,542 --> 01:10:55,459
Thank you very much.

887
01:11:35,626 --> 01:11:38,167
"The Night's over...and
the morning has arrived."

888
01:11:38,334 --> 01:11:40,792
"Happiness has crossed all limits."

889
01:11:40,876 --> 01:11:43,209
"The Night's over...and
the morning has arrived."

890
01:11:43,417 --> 01:11:45,709
"Happiness has crossed all limits."

891
01:11:45,751 --> 01:11:47,709
"My heart leaps and jumps..."

892
01:11:47,959 --> 01:11:50,459
"...with the beat of the drums."

893
01:11:50,542 --> 01:11:52,376
"Today I want to..."

894
01:11:52,751 --> 01:11:55,376
"Today I want to dance."

895
01:11:55,501 --> 01:11:57,792
"Today I want to dance."

896
01:11:57,959 --> 01:12:00,376
"Today I want to dance."

897
01:12:00,584 --> 01:12:03,334
"Today I want to dance."

898
01:12:08,917 --> 01:12:09,876
Show me that step. Show it.

899
01:12:09,959 --> 01:12:11,501
Hello, Mr. Ranjit.

900
01:12:12,667 --> 01:12:14,917
How many people can get on that ship?

901
01:12:15,834 --> 01:12:17,126
I don't know.

902
01:12:17,709 --> 01:12:19,667
Women and children first.

903
01:12:20,417 --> 01:12:21,542
And then the old men, I know.

904
01:12:21,876 --> 01:12:22,542
Hold on.

905
01:12:23,334 --> 01:12:26,292
Did you take it in
writing from Tariq Aziz?

906
01:12:30,376 --> 01:12:31,376
What? Ranjit?

907
01:12:31,751 --> 01:12:34,251
You simply took his word for it?

908
01:12:34,417 --> 01:12:36,501
You must do things properly.

909
01:12:36,834 --> 01:12:38,876
Paperwork is highly important.

910
01:12:40,167 --> 01:12:43,417
I don't know how you handled
such a huge company.

911
01:12:59,917 --> 01:13:01,584
That's good news, Mr. Katiyal.

912
01:13:03,542 --> 01:13:04,542
See you soon.

913
01:13:05,001 --> 01:13:07,084
Papa, what else will we see in India?

914
01:13:07,334 --> 01:13:10,709
Well there's...there's...

915
01:13:11,334 --> 01:13:13,584
You don't remember?
- No, sweetheart. Of course I do.

916
01:13:13,667 --> 01:13:18,792
But if I tell you now,
it'll ruin your surprise.

917
01:13:19,376 --> 01:13:24,376
"Every heart's high on joy."

918
01:13:24,459 --> 01:13:28,167
"Life will be filled with bliss."

919
01:13:29,459 --> 01:13:31,792
"I’m going to lift my
feet and dance all night."

920
01:13:31,876 --> 01:13:34,501
"No one's going to
feel tired and sit down."

921
01:13:34,667 --> 01:13:38,251
"We're going to shake the
earth with the thump of our feet."

922
01:13:39,626 --> 01:13:42,084
"lt's time for friends to rejoice."

923
01:13:42,126 --> 01:13:44,001
"All thanks to God."

924
01:13:44,167 --> 01:13:45,792
"Today I want to..."

925
01:13:46,459 --> 01:13:49,042
"Today I want to dance."

926
01:13:49,251 --> 01:13:51,334
"Today I want to dance."

927
01:13:51,626 --> 01:13:53,959
"Today I want to dance."

928
01:13:54,167 --> 01:13:56,834
"Today I want to dance."

929
01:14:13,001 --> 01:14:13,792
Hello.

930
01:14:14,209 --> 01:14:16,376
Yes, Mr. Kohli.
We were just leaving.

931
01:14:17,792 --> 01:14:20,501
There's bad news, Mr. Katiyal.

932
01:14:21,751 --> 01:14:23,751
UN has enforced an embargo on Iraq.

933
01:14:24,334 --> 01:14:27,959
Which means...nothing
can enter or leave Iraq.

934
01:14:29,001 --> 01:14:29,792
And...

935
01:14:32,001 --> 01:14:33,917
Tipu Sultan has been stopped.

936
01:14:36,042 --> 01:14:38,167
Unfortunately, it won't reach you.

937
01:14:46,251 --> 01:14:47,959
It's being turned away to Dubai.

938
01:14:48,542 --> 01:14:49,292
I'm so sorry.

939
01:15:10,417 --> 01:15:12,917
The United Nations
has proposed the imposition...

940
01:15:13,084 --> 01:15:15,876
...of numerous sanctions
on Iraq for attacking Kuwait.

941
01:15:16,459 --> 01:15:18,501
The UN has refused credibility...

942
01:15:18,584 --> 01:15:22,626
...to the newly formed Kuwait
government after the attack.

943
01:15:24,376 --> 01:15:28,001
They refuted Iraq's claim...

944
01:15:28,751 --> 01:15:30,084
Where are you going?

945
01:15:31,334 --> 01:15:33,084
Where would I go...

946
01:15:33,626 --> 01:15:38,459
in this pigeon coop.

947
01:15:39,917 --> 01:15:43,084
We used to have a
mansion back in Lahore.

948
01:15:43,292 --> 01:15:45,917
We used to play football...

949
01:15:46,167 --> 01:15:47,542
...and cricket in there!

950
01:15:47,751 --> 01:15:49,584
For years you've been telling
me about a place...

951
01:15:50,209 --> 01:15:52,417
...where I'm never
going to be able to go.

952
01:15:52,917 --> 01:15:54,751
Laugh all you want, son.

953
01:15:54,834 --> 01:16:01,251
The Indians trapped in
Kuwait are faced with a dilemma.

954
01:16:03,126 --> 01:16:06,251
Those who are forced to
leave their homes in a jiffy...

955
01:16:09,459 --> 01:16:11,001
...they don't laugh.

956
01:16:16,001 --> 01:16:18,126
Sir... Food is going to be a problem.

957
01:16:18,209 --> 01:16:19,042
What do I do?

958
01:16:19,126 --> 01:16:20,792
Farm the desert?

959
01:16:21,376 --> 01:16:22,834
Why do you come to me?

960
01:16:23,042 --> 01:16:24,209
Solve your own problems.

961
01:16:24,751 --> 01:16:26,417
Saddam hasn't made me the Emir.

962
01:16:26,501 --> 01:16:28,251
Ranjit, what are you saying?
- What else can I do?

963
01:16:28,334 --> 01:16:31,084
Give them hope, and then shatter
it again? And again!

964
01:16:31,376 --> 01:16:32,792
It's not your fault.

965
01:16:32,917 --> 01:16:34,709
And we can't even to talk
to those who are at fault.

966
01:16:34,792 --> 01:16:35,959
Stay here!

967
01:16:37,417 --> 01:16:39,292
We're not going inside!

968
01:16:39,376 --> 01:16:41,584
Let's just go.

969
01:16:41,626 --> 01:16:43,751
You can go. I need to talk.

970
01:16:43,876 --> 01:16:45,626
Talk! Talk about what?

971
01:16:45,792 --> 01:16:46,959
I don't talk to sidekicks!

972
01:16:47,042 --> 01:16:49,417
Whom did you call a sidekick?

973
01:16:50,542 --> 01:16:51,792
Who do you think you are?

974
01:16:51,876 --> 01:16:54,126
You've been a trouble-maker
since you got here!

975
01:16:54,376 --> 01:16:57,042
He didn't have anything in writing.

976
01:16:58,376 --> 01:17:01,376
He made us pack our bags.

977
01:17:01,834 --> 01:17:02,792
Sit in buses...

978
01:17:02,876 --> 01:17:04,126
...and then asked us to get off.

979
01:17:04,334 --> 01:17:05,751
Is this a joke?

980
01:17:06,376 --> 01:17:08,167
He was harping about Baghdad.

981
01:17:08,959 --> 01:17:10,459
Where's Baghdad now?

982
01:17:12,417 --> 01:17:13,209
Forget it. Let's go.

983
01:17:13,417 --> 01:17:15,126
I won't, you go.

984
01:17:18,542 --> 01:17:20,792
You like being a leader, don't you?

985
01:17:21,751 --> 01:17:23,042
A leader has answers.

986
01:17:23,251 --> 01:17:24,084
Do you have any?

987
01:17:27,542 --> 01:17:28,959
You're a big man...

988
01:17:29,459 --> 01:17:33,417
...how would you know
what it feels like...

989
01:17:33,792 --> 01:17:34,876
...to have hopes shattered.

990
01:17:35,917 --> 01:17:37,626
Why are you standing
there quietly now?

991
01:17:38,376 --> 01:17:41,251
Because he's a big man.

992
01:17:42,001 --> 01:17:43,209
If he was petty like you...

993
01:17:43,292 --> 01:17:45,417
...he'd be talking
as much as you, or more.

994
01:17:47,667 --> 01:17:48,876
What do you mean to us?

995
01:17:51,459 --> 01:17:54,876
He could've left with
Simu and me days ago.

996
01:17:55,876 --> 01:17:58,917
He still can. But he isn't.

997
01:18:00,542 --> 01:18:01,876
Instead of staying with his family...

998
01:18:02,501 --> 01:18:05,709
...he worries about you all the time.

999
01:18:07,334 --> 01:18:08,292
And at a time like this...

1000
01:18:08,376 --> 01:18:10,751
...he left us and went to Baghdad.

1001
01:18:11,626 --> 01:18:14,501
You'd be scared to even
go to the end of the street.

1002
01:18:15,917 --> 01:18:18,626
It's easy to point out mistakes,
Mr. George.

1003
01:18:19,459 --> 01:18:22,042
But it takes a lot to
have the courage to make mistakes.

1004
01:18:22,626 --> 01:18:23,751
And he has that courage.

1005
01:18:24,376 --> 01:18:29,792
You don't. - So who asked him...
to take on our responsibility?

1006
01:18:30,126 --> 01:18:31,251
No one did.

1007
01:18:31,709 --> 01:18:33,042
You're right.

1008
01:18:33,542 --> 01:18:35,251
I even warned him against it.

1009
01:18:35,792 --> 01:18:37,084
But what could I do?

1010
01:18:37,459 --> 01:18:39,792
Suddenly he developed a conscience...

1011
01:18:40,001 --> 01:18:43,251
...and realized he
shouldn't be selfish.

1012
01:18:43,626 --> 01:18:45,251
He should help others.

1013
01:18:45,626 --> 01:18:48,876
Some people have a kind of a...
manufacturing defect.

1014
01:18:49,292 --> 01:18:50,959
They change during tough times.

1015
01:18:51,417 --> 01:18:52,751
He changed too.

1016
01:18:54,126 --> 01:18:55,751
You stand here...

1017
01:18:55,792 --> 01:18:57,376
...blaming him for everything.

1018
01:18:58,167 --> 01:19:00,917
But you don't realise...Mr. George...

1019
01:19:01,584 --> 01:19:04,959
...you're only standing
here because of him.

1020
01:19:05,251 --> 01:19:07,001
Because he setup this camp.

1021
01:19:09,542 --> 01:19:11,209
Unfortunately, you'll never meet...

1022
01:19:11,292 --> 01:19:14,167
...the man that Ranjit Katiyal
was 10 days ago.

1023
01:19:14,917 --> 01:19:16,209
Otherwise...he was an expert...

1024
01:19:16,292 --> 01:19:18,001
...in showing a man his place.

1025
01:19:19,876 --> 01:19:21,584
You talk about feelings?

1026
01:19:22,334 --> 01:19:24,001
I saw his face when he was told...

1027
01:19:24,209 --> 01:19:26,709
...that Tipu Sultan
had been turned back.

1028
01:19:28,126 --> 01:19:30,251
You feel bad for your family...

1029
01:19:31,459 --> 01:19:33,626
Imagine the plight of the man...

1030
01:19:33,709 --> 01:19:38,042
...who was hoping to send
thousands of families back home?

1031
01:19:44,167 --> 01:19:45,001
Any more problems?

1032
01:19:45,084 --> 01:19:46,167
Should I go on?

1033
01:19:47,751 --> 01:19:49,417
Please, take him inside.

1034
01:20:09,626 --> 01:20:10,667
I've already told him...

1035
01:20:10,751 --> 01:20:12,626
...Mr. Kohli is back
with the Kuwait issue.

1036
01:20:13,917 --> 01:20:16,751
The Minister hasn't
been answering the phone since.

1037
01:20:17,542 --> 01:20:19,292
It looks like he won't go home today.

1038
01:20:19,501 --> 01:20:21,334
I just need to talk to him.

1039
01:20:23,292 --> 01:20:27,084
I don't get it.
You're not even in the Gulf Division.

1040
01:20:29,251 --> 01:20:32,251
Everyone else is preparing
to leave for the Malaysia conference.

1041
01:20:33,417 --> 01:20:34,792
And you're sitting here.

1042
01:20:36,417 --> 01:20:38,376
Lata, those people are in trouble.

1043
01:20:38,876 --> 01:20:40,876
There's a guy who calls me everyday.

1044
01:20:42,251 --> 01:20:43,459
What do I say to him?

1045
01:20:47,334 --> 01:20:50,251
I told you that the
Minister will support the PWD.

1046
01:20:55,376 --> 01:20:56,292
Yes, sir.

1047
01:20:56,501 --> 01:20:58,042
Has Kohli left or is he still there?

1048
01:21:00,751 --> 01:21:02,917
I think he's gone.
- Good riddance.

1049
01:21:03,209 --> 01:21:05,417
You come in.
- Here I am, sir.

1050
01:21:07,667 --> 01:21:09,042
Sorry, sir.

1051
01:21:09,417 --> 01:21:12,376
I knocked,
but you were on the intercom..

1052
01:21:12,459 --> 01:21:15,751
Kohli, stop acting like
you're scared of me. - Sir.

1053
01:21:16,334 --> 01:21:18,167
Kuwait is not our priority.

1054
01:21:18,251 --> 01:21:20,417
Sir, I have only one request..

1055
01:21:20,584 --> 01:21:24,792
You know our government is not stable.

1056
01:21:24,917 --> 01:21:27,751
There's no guarantee
how long we'll stay in power.

1057
01:21:27,792 --> 01:21:30,209
Of course not sir..
- But you bureaucrats...

1058
01:21:30,459 --> 01:21:32,209
...are here until your retirement.

1059
01:21:33,209 --> 01:21:35,667
And something will happen
only if you want it to.

1060
01:21:37,626 --> 01:21:38,917
You're right, sir.

1061
01:21:39,626 --> 01:21:42,959
I've been waiting for
four hours to say exactly this.

1062
01:21:44,001 --> 01:21:45,251
It's been four hours?

1063
01:21:47,501 --> 01:21:48,459
Fine...

1064
01:21:49,917 --> 01:21:51,501
...you guys handle it.

1065
01:22:02,376 --> 01:22:03,167
Hello.

1066
01:22:04,626 --> 01:22:06,001
Yes, hold on Kurien.

1067
01:22:07,334 --> 01:22:08,626
Ranjit, it's Kurien.

1068
01:22:14,209 --> 01:22:15,584
Hello. Yes.

1069
01:22:18,959 --> 01:22:20,959
Fine. That's good.

1070
01:22:21,042 --> 01:22:22,084
Fine.

1071
01:22:22,167 --> 01:22:23,042
What happened?

1072
01:22:23,126 --> 01:22:24,792
They're running out
of food in the camp.

1073
01:22:25,167 --> 01:22:25,959
So what are they doing?

1074
01:22:26,126 --> 01:22:28,792
Kurien sent Ibrahim to the docks.

1075
01:22:29,334 --> 01:22:30,292
There's some holding shed...

1076
01:22:30,376 --> 01:22:32,709
...where they used to buy
stuff for the supermarket.

1077
01:22:33,042 --> 01:22:34,917
He saw some activity there.

1078
01:22:35,167 --> 01:22:37,501
Now?
- So Kurien's going there.

1079
01:22:37,709 --> 01:22:39,376
He might find something.

1080
01:22:39,459 --> 01:22:40,751
Shouldn't you be going?

1081
01:22:40,917 --> 01:22:44,376
Why? Are you feeling
like yelling at George again?

1082
01:22:47,667 --> 01:22:49,459
I go there, return empty handed...

1083
01:22:49,751 --> 01:22:51,792
...George blames me,
and you yell at him

1084
01:22:52,042 --> 01:22:53,626
And we get entertained in Kuwait.

1085
01:22:56,709 --> 01:22:58,501
Come on, Ranjit.

1086
01:22:59,501 --> 01:23:01,042
Ranjit.

1087
01:23:03,251 --> 01:23:04,876
You're a negotiator, baby.

1088
01:23:06,042 --> 01:23:08,584
They can't get what you can.

1089
01:23:10,334 --> 01:23:11,501
What if I fail?

1090
01:23:13,584 --> 01:23:14,667
You won't.

1091
01:23:15,876 --> 01:23:16,917
You won't.

1092
01:23:18,376 --> 01:23:19,626
Its not in your DNA

1093
01:23:33,876 --> 01:23:35,501
It's definitely not a supply ship.

1094
01:23:36,001 --> 01:23:38,042
Seems like they're
preparing to leave though

1095
01:23:38,584 --> 01:23:39,584
Let's go take a look.

1096
01:23:49,334 --> 01:23:52,417
Excuse me...are you Indian?

1097
01:23:54,542 --> 01:23:55,959
Yes. Why?

1098
01:23:56,251 --> 01:23:59,751
No... Is this ship going anywhere?

1099
01:24:01,792 --> 01:24:05,292
Yes...is there a problem?

1100
01:24:05,459 --> 01:24:08,667
No, I... Are they letting you out?

1101
01:24:09,209 --> 01:24:10,542
We're taking garbage

1102
01:24:12,334 --> 01:24:13,126
Garbage?

1103
01:24:13,292 --> 01:24:16,792
Hey fatso... Come here.

1104
01:24:19,167 --> 01:24:22,667
Who cares about
garbage in the middle of a war?

1105
01:24:23,167 --> 01:24:25,751
I do. I am the captain of this ship.

1106
01:24:25,876 --> 01:24:27,751
Our company has a contract for this.

1107
01:24:28,001 --> 01:24:28,876
Anything else?

1108
01:24:29,209 --> 01:24:32,251
Captain, how many people
can get on this ship?

1109
01:24:33,542 --> 01:24:35,376
Around 500

1110
01:24:35,626 --> 01:24:37,292
But don't even think about it.

1111
01:24:37,376 --> 01:24:39,084
Can you think about it if I pay you?

1112
01:24:46,084 --> 01:24:47,959
Hey... Leave.

1113
01:24:52,501 --> 01:24:53,959
Quickly. Double-march.

1114
01:24:58,376 --> 01:24:59,334
I can.

1115
01:25:00,042 --> 01:25:02,792
But not a single Kuwaiti.
- Of course.

1116
01:25:03,667 --> 01:25:05,459
How much for a single person.

1117
01:25:08,042 --> 01:25:09,709
5000 dollar.
- Hey...

1118
01:25:10,376 --> 01:25:13,001
Who pays 5000 dollars for garbage?

1119
01:25:13,334 --> 01:25:15,959
I can dump garbage in
the middle of the sea.

1120
01:25:16,209 --> 01:25:17,751
Not you.

1121
01:25:20,376 --> 01:25:23,042
Who do I have to take?
- What do you care about names?

1122
01:25:23,792 --> 01:25:25,167
I can pay you 200 dollars per person.

1123
01:25:29,334 --> 01:25:31,917
Why would I risk
my life for 200 dollars?

1124
01:25:32,001 --> 01:25:34,334
You can for 100,000 dollars?

1125
01:25:35,917 --> 01:25:38,209
200 dollars per person. 500 people

1126
01:25:38,459 --> 01:25:39,751
100,000 dollars

1127
01:25:40,126 --> 01:25:42,876
It's a two hours journey
The money will be all yours.

1128
01:25:45,126 --> 01:25:46,084
Let's go, Kurien.

1129
01:25:48,792 --> 01:25:50,751
Don't look back,
keep walking straight.

1130
01:25:51,292 --> 01:25:52,751
Look straight...
- Wait a minute.

1131
01:25:53,001 --> 01:25:53,709
Fine.

1132
01:25:55,584 --> 01:25:57,959
But they won't be my responsibility.

1133
01:25:58,626 --> 01:25:59,251
Okay?

1134
01:25:59,751 --> 01:26:02,209
Get the money and
the people at midnight.

1135
01:26:02,459 --> 01:26:04,751
But not a single Kuwaiti.

1136
01:26:07,959 --> 01:26:08,959
Poonawala.

1137
01:26:12,917 --> 01:26:15,292
The Sheikhs are having a meeting.

1138
01:26:20,334 --> 01:26:21,751
They didn't invite us.

1139
01:26:22,251 --> 01:26:24,209
Wherever the ship takes you...

1140
01:26:24,334 --> 01:26:27,626
...you call Red Cross
and claim refugee status.

1141
01:26:28,584 --> 01:26:30,042
I've spoken to the captain.

1142
01:26:30,209 --> 01:26:33,001
It will be 200 dollars per person.

1143
01:26:34,209 --> 01:26:36,334
You can all afford it.

1144
01:26:36,917 --> 01:26:39,292
I personally feel,
it's a risk worth taking.

1145
01:26:39,584 --> 01:26:43,292
This is the army tank,
these are guns and this is the Police.

1146
01:26:43,459 --> 01:26:45,501
Baby, why?

1147
01:26:47,001 --> 01:26:49,917
Amrita, Simmu isn't ready yet?

1148
01:26:50,334 --> 01:26:51,751
You haven't packed either.

1149
01:26:52,084 --> 01:26:53,792
Why pack when we
aren't going anywhere?

1150
01:26:54,751 --> 01:26:56,042
Papa, give me my book.

1151
01:26:56,167 --> 01:26:57,001
Give it back.

1152
01:27:01,876 --> 01:27:03,001
Don't be childish.

1153
01:27:03,126 --> 01:27:04,751
I think you've forgotten Punjabi.

1154
01:27:05,209 --> 01:27:07,542
<i>"I'll</i> go wherever my husband goes."

1155
01:27:09,417 --> 01:27:10,876
Don't force me, Ranjit.

1156
01:27:11,167 --> 01:27:13,417
I'm not going anywhere without you.

1157
01:27:13,959 --> 01:27:15,251
And like you said...

1158
01:27:15,542 --> 01:27:18,001
Our fate is entwined
with the fate of the others

1159
01:27:24,334 --> 01:27:26,626
Why don't you just admit
that your real problem is the garbage.

1160
01:27:36,084 --> 01:27:37,042
Hello.

1161
01:27:37,209 --> 01:27:39,542
Sanjeev Kohli, Mr. Katiyal.

1162
01:27:39,834 --> 01:27:41,376
You've called after quite a while

1163
01:27:41,959 --> 01:27:43,167
Where were you all these days?

1164
01:27:43,542 --> 01:27:46,334
Well...l couldn't figure anything out

1165
01:27:46,626 --> 01:27:49,626
But now we're talking to Jordan...

1166
01:27:50,126 --> 01:27:52,584
...to let the Indians in Amman.

1167
01:27:52,751 --> 01:27:53,626
Amman?

1168
01:27:54,501 --> 01:27:56,709
Amman is 1000 kilometers from here.

1169
01:27:56,917 --> 01:27:58,751
And we'll have to go through Iraq.

1170
01:27:59,126 --> 01:28:01,251
Kohli sir, you can say it so easily.

1171
01:28:01,501 --> 01:28:02,792
But how will we get there?

1172
01:28:03,001 --> 01:28:06,292
You see...this is
the only option we have.

1173
01:28:07,209 --> 01:28:10,042
And even that is not confirmed.

1174
01:28:10,126 --> 01:28:11,584
Then confirm it

1175
01:28:11,751 --> 01:28:14,417
Because we can't stay here for long,
and that's confirmed

1176
01:28:14,751 --> 01:28:15,917
Another thing Kohli sir.

1177
01:28:16,042 --> 01:28:18,751
I'm sending 500 people
on a ship from here.

1178
01:28:18,917 --> 01:28:21,959
Please...try to get them asylum.

1179
01:28:22,292 --> 01:28:23,542
I'll give you the details.

1180
01:28:23,751 --> 01:28:25,001
And don't just stop there.

1181
01:28:25,376 --> 01:28:27,042
There are still 150,000 left here.

1182
01:28:33,001 --> 01:28:38,417
Sir...how will we go with them...
- you go with Kurien

1183
01:28:38,584 --> 01:28:40,792
Kurien, look after them.

1184
01:28:41,376 --> 01:28:42,709
Don't worry.

1185
01:28:43,126 --> 01:28:43,792
Come.

1186
01:28:51,251 --> 01:28:52,167
Ranjit.

1187
01:28:54,042 --> 01:28:57,376
Thank you, buddy.
- Good luck.

1188
01:28:57,751 --> 01:28:59,042
Look after everyone.

1189
01:29:00,542 --> 01:29:04,542
Ranjit. What did you say?

1190
01:29:05,709 --> 01:29:08,792
First women and children
and then old men.

1191
01:29:09,209 --> 01:29:12,334
But here only the rich are going.
- This is really, really unfair Mr. Katiyal.

1192
01:29:12,501 --> 01:29:14,501
Just because we can't give
the money... - Mr. Poonawala...

1193
01:29:14,584 --> 01:29:16,001
...l know you don't have money.

1194
01:29:16,084 --> 01:29:18,626
And all the people with
you don't have money either.

1195
01:29:18,834 --> 01:29:20,751
I do...but I am not going.

1196
01:29:21,751 --> 01:29:24,417
There's no point in getting
jealous of those who are going.

1197
01:29:24,626 --> 01:29:27,376
And anyway, they're paying a price.
- And us?

1198
01:29:28,001 --> 01:29:30,792
Should we look out for ourselves?
- I didn't say that.

1199
01:29:31,251 --> 01:29:33,001
I am still here with you.

1200
01:29:35,209 --> 01:29:36,959
Joseph, take the bus.
- Yes, sir.

1201
01:29:37,334 --> 01:29:39,042
Look, Mr. Ranjit..
- Hey..

1202
01:29:40,167 --> 01:29:42,376
Enough...in one moment

1203
01:29:44,917 --> 01:29:45,917
I'll prove Amrita wrong...

1204
01:29:46,001 --> 01:29:48,084
...and go back to
being the old Ranjit...

1205
01:29:48,167 --> 01:29:50,084
...which none of you will like.

1206
01:29:52,626 --> 01:29:54,876
I am doing whatever I can.

1207
01:29:56,167 --> 01:29:57,501
Don't ask for more.

1208
01:30:12,542 --> 01:30:14,417
Heads down. Heads down.

1209
01:30:51,501 --> 01:30:54,376
Spicy Indian food and whiskey.

1210
01:30:56,084 --> 01:30:59,042
I know you're a man of your words.

1211
01:31:01,584 --> 01:31:04,126
Then...why are you cheating?

1212
01:31:07,542 --> 01:31:08,334
Cheating?

1213
01:31:09,792 --> 01:31:12,751
You said...l am the Emir now.

1214
01:31:13,459 --> 01:31:16,209
Wouldn't I know that...

1215
01:31:16,376 --> 01:31:20,751
...you're illegally
sending 500 Indians out?

1216
01:31:28,834 --> 01:31:30,792
They can still go...

1217
01:31:31,542 --> 01:31:34,792
Just pay the price to the Amir.

1218
01:31:37,292 --> 01:31:38,876
I've already have.

1219
01:31:39,834 --> 01:31:41,584
<i>2</i> bottles of whiskey and this.

1220
01:31:47,417 --> 01:31:49,959
I want 100,000 dollars.

1221
01:31:50,459 --> 01:31:51,959
I said I was wrong.

1222
01:31:53,542 --> 01:31:54,876
You're not the Emir.

1223
01:32:00,126 --> 01:32:01,042
If you were the Emir...

1224
01:32:01,126 --> 01:32:03,584
...then you would've know about
the deal I made in Baghdad.

1225
01:32:04,334 --> 01:32:05,084
What deal?

1226
01:32:05,709 --> 01:32:07,917
Talk to the External Minister.

1227
01:32:08,126 --> 01:32:10,167
Everyone knows...
if the US intervenes...

1228
01:32:10,251 --> 01:32:13,167
...lraq will no longer have Kuwait.

1229
01:32:13,959 --> 01:32:16,501
But they will definitely
have the riches looted from Iraq.

1230
01:32:17,376 --> 01:32:20,709
All that money
goes to the Swiss Bank.

1231
01:32:21,584 --> 01:32:24,959
And your government
has asked me to do this for them.

1232
01:32:28,167 --> 01:32:30,209
Call Baghdad and let the bus go.

1233
01:32:30,542 --> 01:32:33,542
Otherwise your President
Mr. Saddam Hussein will

1234
01:32:33,626 --> 01:32:34,917
hang you like he did Fawad...

1235
01:32:36,959 --> 01:32:40,376
I want 100,000 dollars right now.

1236
01:32:56,209 --> 01:32:58,459
May I please speak to Mr. Tariq Aziz

1237
01:32:58,667 --> 01:33:00,542
this is Ranjit Katiyal speaking
- Mr. Ranjit.

1238
01:33:00,626 --> 01:33:01,376
Please, stop.

1239
01:33:01,751 --> 01:33:04,209
This is not necessary.

1240
01:33:04,501 --> 01:33:06,042
Please, finish dinner.

1241
01:33:07,501 --> 01:33:09,876
I insist Major, please.

1242
01:33:20,251 --> 01:33:23,001
Ranjit,
you never told me about the deal.

1243
01:33:23,167 --> 01:33:24,709
There was no deal.

1244
01:33:25,917 --> 01:33:27,751
Did you...

1245
01:33:28,042 --> 01:33:29,584
I had no other option.

1246
01:33:29,667 --> 01:33:31,376
What if he cross-checks?

1247
01:33:31,459 --> 01:33:34,751
No one can risk
cross-checking with Saddam.

1248
01:33:34,959 --> 01:33:36,792
But that Major

1249
01:33:36,917 --> 01:33:38,667
He'll definitely do something.

1250
01:33:39,167 --> 01:33:40,501
I was just thinking that

1251
01:33:40,751 --> 01:33:42,917
I hope I didn't risk
the lives of 150,000...

1252
01:33:43,001 --> 01:33:45,001
...in order to save 500.

1253
01:33:59,292 --> 01:34:01,126
Mr. Katiyal, at this hour?

1254
01:34:01,209 --> 01:34:02,626
Mr. Kohli, I am leaving
for Jordan in the morning...

1255
01:34:02,709 --> 01:34:03,792
...along with my people.

1256
01:34:03,876 --> 01:34:04,709
Jordan?

1257
01:34:04,876 --> 01:34:06,417
What happened?

1258
01:34:06,751 --> 01:34:09,084
I never trusted the Iraqi army.

1259
01:34:09,292 --> 01:34:10,917
The situation here is getting worse.

1260
01:34:11,042 --> 01:34:13,334
But you can't go to Jordan just yet.

1261
01:34:13,501 --> 01:34:16,126
Look...we just started
negotiating with them...

1262
01:34:16,209 --> 01:34:18,667
...and they haven't
made a decision yet.

1263
01:34:18,751 --> 01:34:20,709
Then get a decision taken, Mr. Kohli.

1264
01:34:20,959 --> 01:34:22,292
We don't have an option.

1265
01:34:22,459 --> 01:34:25,334
Trying to get there with
so many people is dangerous.

1266
01:34:25,584 --> 01:34:28,084
Staying is
Kuwait is even more dangerous.

1267
01:34:28,376 --> 01:34:30,459
Give me a few days.

1268
01:34:30,667 --> 01:34:33,417
I'm talking to the
Civil Aviation ministry...

1269
01:34:33,542 --> 01:34:35,584
Mr. Kohli, please hurry up.

1270
01:34:35,917 --> 01:34:38,167
Get the Jordan border to open for us.

1271
01:34:38,417 --> 01:34:40,042
Because we're leaving.

1272
01:34:40,709 --> 01:34:41,584
Goodnight.

1273
01:34:56,709 --> 01:34:57,459
Hello.

1274
01:34:58,126 --> 01:35:00,167
Can I talk to Amrit Pal?

1275
01:35:01,417 --> 01:35:03,626
I know it's late,
but it's very urgent.

1276
01:35:03,834 --> 01:35:06,042
This is Kuwait and this is Jordan.

1277
01:35:06,251 --> 01:35:11,126
The distance from here
to here is 1091 kilometers.

1278
01:35:11,376 --> 01:35:13,751
And for that I need all your help.

1279
01:35:13,917 --> 01:35:15,417
Take as many men as you can.

1280
01:35:22,584 --> 01:35:24,292
Ahmed, here you go.

1281
01:35:57,792 --> 01:36:00,709
Why can't I come?
- Why don't you understand?

1282
01:36:00,792 --> 01:36:02,542
We're doing this for a reason.

1283
01:36:02,626 --> 01:36:04,167
Mr. Poonawala, you get on that bus.

1284
01:36:04,292 --> 01:36:06,251
Meher, go with your dad.

1285
01:36:07,167 --> 01:36:08,292
Joseph, tell everyone...

1286
01:36:08,376 --> 01:36:11,042
...that everyone leaves in
groups of 3-4 vehicles. - Okay.

1287
01:36:11,126 --> 01:36:12,709
And we all meet at Jahra border.
- Okay.

1288
01:36:12,792 --> 01:36:14,459
And from there we go together.
- Okay, sir.

1289
01:36:14,626 --> 01:36:17,584
Did you make sure some young men

1290
01:36:17,667 --> 01:36:19,292
are in each vehicle
- Yes...l did.

1291
01:36:19,376 --> 01:36:20,334
Okay.

1292
01:36:20,667 --> 01:36:21,959
Where's Ibrahim.

1293
01:36:22,042 --> 01:36:23,709
Sir, I don't know.

1294
01:36:23,876 --> 01:36:25,251
OK don't worry about it.

1295
01:36:36,042 --> 01:36:38,792
So now you're making
a fuss instead of George.

1296
01:36:42,751 --> 01:36:44,084
Sir, I won't go.

1297
01:36:45,417 --> 01:36:47,209
Not without Shazin.

1298
01:36:47,417 --> 01:36:49,667
It's not right for me to go.

1299
01:36:49,834 --> 01:36:52,001
I'll stay here, and look for her.

1300
01:36:52,334 --> 01:36:55,626
If you want to find
her then move ahead.

1301
01:36:56,667 --> 01:36:58,626
By staying here you're proving...

1302
01:36:59,126 --> 01:37:01,584
...that you've lost
all hope to see her.

1303
01:37:01,959 --> 01:37:04,584
Try to look for her where
all Indians are going.

1304
01:37:05,126 --> 01:37:06,251
Maybe...

1305
01:37:19,584 --> 01:37:22,709
Good thing we are going from here.

1306
01:37:23,084 --> 01:37:25,084
God knows what it will be like there.

1307
01:37:25,292 --> 01:37:28,042
Whatever it is,
it will be better than here.

1308
01:37:32,751 --> 01:37:34,709
What did she say?
- What?

1309
01:37:37,126 --> 01:37:39,042
She's your sponsor, right?

1310
01:37:39,251 --> 01:37:40,917
Sponsor...
- She's a Kuwaiti?

1311
01:37:41,792 --> 01:37:43,501
You worked for her, didn't you?

1312
01:37:43,584 --> 01:37:44,334
No, sir...

1313
01:37:44,584 --> 01:37:45,959
Why are you getting involved?

1314
01:37:46,292 --> 01:37:49,209
He's the kid, not me.

1315
01:37:49,459 --> 01:37:51,042
She spoke in Arabic.

1316
01:37:51,417 --> 01:37:52,959
You're a Kuwaiti, aren't you?

1317
01:37:53,042 --> 01:37:54,167
I'm telling you...

1318
01:37:54,292 --> 01:37:55,626
Do you think I'm an idiot?

1319
01:37:56,667 --> 01:37:57,709
George sir.

1320
01:37:57,792 --> 01:37:58,917
Where are you going?

1321
01:38:00,959 --> 01:38:02,584
Why did you get off the bus now?

1322
01:38:02,667 --> 01:38:04,126
You need me to get something
in writing from Saddam?

1323
01:38:04,501 --> 01:38:07,334
You weren't able to,
but I found out.

1324
01:38:07,834 --> 01:38:09,792
A time-bomb is ticking
in the bus. - What?

1325
01:38:10,209 --> 01:38:13,292
The woman traveling with Preethi,
she's a Kuwaiti.

1326
01:38:13,834 --> 01:38:16,042
I know that.
- You know.

1327
01:38:16,834 --> 01:38:19,667
And yet you let her stay in the camp.

1328
01:38:19,751 --> 01:38:21,417
If the Iraqi army would have found out...

1329
01:38:21,501 --> 01:38:23,334
...they would've cut
us all to pieces that day. .

1330
01:38:23,459 --> 01:38:25,167
They didn't find out,
you're still alive, aren't you?

1331
01:38:25,251 --> 01:38:26,167
Let's go.

1332
01:38:26,251 --> 01:38:28,126
Is this a joke, Mr. Ranjit?

1333
01:38:29,292 --> 01:38:32,334
If the Iraqi army finds out...

1334
01:38:32,417 --> 01:38:36,459
...that we're taking
a Kuwaiti in our bus...

1335
01:38:36,792 --> 01:38:38,959
...then our lives will be in danger.

1336
01:38:39,834 --> 01:38:42,001
Leave a woman and
a child behind to die...

1337
01:38:42,459 --> 01:38:45,292
...only because she's a Kuwaiti?

1338
01:38:46,917 --> 01:38:48,792
I can't do that, George.

1339
01:38:49,792 --> 01:38:50,709
What?

1340
01:38:51,167 --> 01:38:54,417
That Kuwaiti life is important to you,

1341
01:38:54,751 --> 01:38:56,959
...not ours?

1342
01:38:57,876 --> 01:39:00,626
You have no right to do this.

1343
01:39:01,167 --> 01:39:02,292
This is wrong.

1344
01:39:08,917 --> 01:39:10,251
Ranjit.

1345
01:39:14,251 --> 01:39:16,042
Ask her to come out.
- Sir.

1346
01:39:16,251 --> 01:39:19,126
Tell her to come out.
- Sir, where will she go?

1347
01:39:19,209 --> 01:39:21,042
You come out first.

1348
01:39:21,167 --> 01:39:22,042
Come out.

1349
01:39:22,501 --> 01:39:23,459
Come out.

1350
01:39:24,667 --> 01:39:25,959
Give me the kid.

1351
01:39:27,417 --> 01:39:27,834
Sir.

1352
01:39:27,917 --> 01:39:29,167
Come.

1353
01:39:29,292 --> 01:39:31,751
Sir, please.

1354
01:39:33,292 --> 01:39:34,584
Sir...
- Come on.

1355
01:39:34,667 --> 01:39:36,292
Let's go.
- Sir.

1356
01:39:37,917 --> 01:39:39,334
Come on.

1357
01:39:44,292 --> 01:39:45,709
Get down.

1358
01:39:52,292 --> 01:39:54,667
DO I have the right to risk my life...

1359
01:39:55,834 --> 01:39:57,667
Or should I get that in writing too?

1360
01:40:00,876 --> 01:40:02,459
Get into the bus.

1361
01:40:18,459 --> 01:40:21,501
She's Tasneem.
She'll be going with us to Amman.

1362
01:40:21,667 --> 01:40:22,917
She's a Kuwaiti.

1363
01:40:24,042 --> 01:40:25,876
You can come with us, in our car.

1364
01:40:26,876 --> 01:40:32,501
"The desire of my eyes..."

1365
01:40:33,167 --> 01:40:38,626
"...is to keep staring at your face."

1366
01:40:39,542 --> 01:40:44,709
"My slumbers are filled..."

1367
01:40:45,876 --> 01:40:50,209
"...with only your dreams."

1368
01:40:50,667 --> 01:40:53,751
"They all lead me to you..."

1369
01:40:53,834 --> 01:40:56,709
"...all the paths in the world."

1370
01:40:56,917 --> 01:40:59,876
"I love you so much."

1371
01:41:00,084 --> 01:41:04,167
"You cannot imagine."

1372
01:42:36,501 --> 01:42:39,834
Go meet Mr. Tripathi, okay.

1373
01:42:40,834 --> 01:42:42,251
Kohli, we've forwarded the proposal.

1374
01:42:42,334 --> 01:42:44,167
And we're talking
to the Air-Force chief.

1375
01:42:44,251 --> 01:42:45,584
We'll have to Airlift them.

1376
01:42:45,959 --> 01:42:49,167
But sir, 170,000 people
in Air-Force planes?

1377
01:42:50,001 --> 01:42:52,709
I know it's not possible.
- So then?

1378
01:42:53,417 --> 01:42:56,917
The Air India Chief has
been summoned in the morning.

1379
01:42:57,709 --> 01:42:59,751
Air India planes can do it,
can't they?

1380
01:43:00,084 --> 01:43:02,459
But, sir...civilian
aircraft in a war zone?

1381
01:43:02,751 --> 01:43:04,251
That's crazy.

1382
01:43:12,376 --> 01:43:13,876
Two dates.

1383
01:43:14,126 --> 01:43:16,167
Are we breaking a fast or eating a meal?

1384
01:43:16,251 --> 01:43:17,709
I'll take it if he doesn't want it.

1385
01:43:21,251 --> 01:43:21,959
Here you go.

1386
01:43:22,167 --> 01:43:24,292
No, mom, no dates.
Something else.

1387
01:43:24,876 --> 01:43:26,709
Baby, eat this now.

1388
01:43:26,792 --> 01:43:28,917
We'll eat 'jalebis'
when we get to India, okay.

1389
01:43:29,251 --> 01:43:30,459
Good girl.

1390
01:43:35,667 --> 01:43:38,251
You must help us with the evacuation.

1391
01:43:38,584 --> 01:43:42,209
We're commercial pilots, sir.
Not the Indian Air Force.

1392
01:43:42,334 --> 01:43:44,459
Look, we already had a
word with the Air India chief.

1393
01:43:44,542 --> 01:43:45,251
$0?

1394
01:43:45,626 --> 01:43:47,501
We have to fly planes
Into a war zone, not him

1395
01:43:47,667 --> 01:43:48,292
Yes.

1396
01:43:48,459 --> 01:43:50,792
And if we wanted to risk our lives...

1397
01:43:51,001 --> 01:43:52,834
...then we would've
joined the Air Force.

1398
01:43:53,042 --> 01:43:55,251
Why don't you volunteer
to fly the plane?

1399
01:43:55,501 --> 01:43:57,126
Sir, can I talk to them.

1400
01:44:03,126 --> 01:44:05,459
Look, there's no
question of forcing you.

1401
01:44:06,751 --> 01:44:08,876
It's your choice
whether you go or not.

1402
01:44:08,959 --> 01:44:12,542
But 175,000 people are
waiting for us in Jordan.

1403
01:44:14,292 --> 01:44:15,542
And their only fault is...

1404
01:44:15,626 --> 01:44:17,917
...that they're Indians,
but not our kin.

1405
01:44:20,334 --> 01:44:21,917
I can't give you a reason...

1406
01:44:22,042 --> 01:44:23,709
...to risk your lives for them.

1407
01:44:26,334 --> 01:44:28,001
It's best that you
find one yourselves...

1408
01:44:28,084 --> 01:44:29,626
...that would save their lives.

1409
01:44:54,209 --> 01:44:55,292
Meher.

1410
01:44:58,251 --> 01:45:00,292
I've seen so much news.

1411
01:45:01,167 --> 01:45:04,876
But never thought that someday
we'll be the news.

1412
01:45:05,876 --> 01:45:09,292
"Indian Refugees in
Kuwait Because of lraq."

1413
01:45:11,376 --> 01:45:13,667
It's so confusing, isn't it?

1414
01:45:22,584 --> 01:45:23,709
Oh yes...

1415
01:45:25,001 --> 01:45:26,959
The Minister was asking...

1416
01:45:27,126 --> 01:45:28,751
...who's going to pay for all this?

1417
01:45:30,792 --> 01:45:33,459
I think the Finance Ministry
will have to jump in.

1418
01:45:36,251 --> 01:45:37,959
Will you talk to them or should I?

1419
01:45:38,209 --> 01:45:39,334
You do it, sir.

1420
01:45:39,751 --> 01:45:41,167
You see, they have no documents...

1421
01:45:41,251 --> 01:45:44,001
...so I'll try and get
temporary passports issued.

1422
01:46:12,084 --> 01:46:13,167
Ranjit.

1423
01:46:13,751 --> 01:46:14,751
Ranjit.

1424
01:46:22,834 --> 01:46:24,334
Don't get out of the car?

1425
01:46:28,584 --> 01:46:29,667
Officer, Indian.

1426
01:46:29,751 --> 01:46:32,292
Indian.
We all Indian.

1427
01:46:32,834 --> 01:46:34,626
We got permission
from President Saddam...

1428
01:46:34,709 --> 01:46:36,126
Papers...
- To go to Jordan.

1429
01:46:36,417 --> 01:46:37,292
Passport.

1430
01:46:37,376 --> 01:46:38,334
Show me the passport.

1431
01:46:39,626 --> 01:46:40,834
Don't try to ruin things now.

1432
01:46:40,917 --> 01:46:42,042
Get back.

1433
01:46:42,126 --> 01:46:42,959
Show me the passport.

1434
01:46:43,042 --> 01:46:44,167
I don't have passport. No passport.

1435
01:46:44,251 --> 01:46:45,251
But we assure you...
- Kuwaiti.

1436
01:46:45,334 --> 01:46:46,876
We're all Indian.
- Kuwaiti.

1437
01:46:46,959 --> 01:46:48,334
Kuwaiti.
- No, no, no...we're not Kuwaiti.

1438
01:46:48,626 --> 01:46:49,501
Stop it. Stop it.

1439
01:46:49,584 --> 01:46:52,667
Passport. Passport.
- Stay inside, Amrita.

1440
01:46:58,042 --> 01:47:00,209
Indian. We're Indians, sir.

1441
01:47:02,876 --> 01:47:03,626
Two more people.

1442
01:47:03,709 --> 01:47:05,042
I want two more passports.
- No, no, no.

1443
01:47:05,126 --> 01:47:07,001
They are all Indians.
We don't have passports.

1444
01:47:07,167 --> 01:47:08,167
Kuwaiti?
- No, no, no...

1445
01:47:08,251 --> 01:47:09,334
No, Indian.

1446
01:47:09,417 --> 01:47:10,209
Kuwaiti...

1447
01:47:10,292 --> 01:47:12,876
We're Indian. Indian.
- Kuwaiti. - No, Indian.

1448
01:47:13,084 --> 01:47:15,251
Indian.

1449
01:47:17,084 --> 01:47:20,709
Dollar. Money.
- You take your money, I take your wife.

1450
01:47:21,209 --> 01:47:23,751
She's a Kuwaiti.
Let my boys have some fun.

1451
01:48:12,959 --> 01:48:14,126
Ranjit.

1452
01:48:14,709 --> 01:48:16,751
Stop it. Leave me.

1453
01:48:17,084 --> 01:48:18,042
Ranjit.

1454
01:48:18,251 --> 01:48:19,251
Ranjit.

1455
01:48:20,251 --> 01:48:21,209
Ranjit.

1456
01:48:22,959 --> 01:48:23,792
Help!

1457
01:48:26,626 --> 01:48:27,792
Please, no...

1458
01:48:28,209 --> 01:48:32,376
Please, don't.
Please.

1459
01:48:59,126 --> 01:49:03,167
Drop your gun...and you all can live.

1460
01:49:39,126 --> 01:49:41,667
No, no, no...it can't be
done at your level, Mr. Kohli.

1461
01:49:41,751 --> 01:49:44,501
Why are you arguing, Mr. Chapekar?

1462
01:49:45,209 --> 01:49:48,459
I told you that the Minister
from Kuwait division...

1463
01:49:48,542 --> 01:49:51,584
Mr. Kohli, without confirming
at the secretary level...

1464
01:49:51,667 --> 01:49:54,792
...at the Amman embassy,
we can't issue temporary passports.

1465
01:49:54,876 --> 01:49:55,917
Please try and understand.

1466
01:49:56,042 --> 01:49:57,209
Let people come in...

1467
01:49:57,292 --> 01:50:00,667
...and I'll ask the Minister himself
to speak to you.

1468
01:50:21,959 --> 01:50:23,167
What now?

1469
01:50:23,417 --> 01:50:24,792
Will he open the gate?

1470
01:50:24,876 --> 01:50:26,209
I wonder what will happen.

1471
01:50:36,709 --> 01:50:38,001
Well done Kohli.

1472
01:51:30,584 --> 01:51:31,334
Sir...

1473
01:51:31,917 --> 01:51:33,042
Sir, what now?

1474
01:51:33,251 --> 01:51:34,251
Where are the others?

1475
01:51:34,334 --> 01:51:36,292
Some got down with Joseph.

1476
01:51:36,417 --> 01:51:38,251
And the rest are sitting on the buses.

1477
01:51:38,834 --> 01:51:42,167
Excuse me. Mr. Katiyal.

1478
01:51:42,251 --> 01:51:44,251
One question..
- Not now.

1479
01:51:44,584 --> 01:51:46,251
Mr. Poonawala,
please go sit in the bus.

1480
01:51:46,334 --> 01:51:47,751
Not now.
- Ranjit.

1481
01:51:48,417 --> 01:51:49,792
There are flags from all countries...

1482
01:51:49,876 --> 01:51:51,667
...but where's the Indian flag?

1483
01:51:53,042 --> 01:51:55,584
Do one thing, take her.
- Yes.

1484
01:51:55,959 --> 01:51:58,167
Hold my hand, Simu.

1485
01:52:08,459 --> 01:52:10,792
Mr. Kohli, I could've
insisted for written orders...

1486
01:52:10,876 --> 01:52:11,834
But I am not.

1487
01:52:13,084 --> 01:52:14,251
Please hold on.

1488
01:52:14,751 --> 01:52:15,459
Hello.

1489
01:52:15,792 --> 01:52:16,709
Yes, Mohan.

1490
01:52:17,209 --> 01:52:18,001
Huh?

1491
01:52:19,042 --> 01:52:20,792
They're at the airport.
- They've already arrived...

1492
01:52:20,876 --> 01:52:22,626
...and you're still
stuck in red tape.

1493
01:52:22,751 --> 01:52:24,876
Mr. Kohli.
Will you please keep quiet?

1494
01:52:25,001 --> 01:52:26,001
Please.!

1495
01:52:26,084 --> 01:52:27,001
Hello...

1496
01:52:27,084 --> 01:52:28,876
Yeah, I'll do something.

1497
01:52:29,167 --> 01:52:30,584
Give me sometime, I'll do something.

1498
01:52:31,376 --> 01:52:34,667
Chapekar sir...they are our people.

1499
01:52:35,376 --> 01:52:37,501
They've already suffered a lot.

1500
01:52:37,834 --> 01:52:39,334
Please don't make
them suffer any more...

1501
01:52:39,417 --> 01:52:41,084
...by waiting for orders.

1502
01:52:41,292 --> 01:52:42,334
Please.

1503
01:52:43,126 --> 01:52:43,917
Excuse me.

1504
01:52:44,084 --> 01:52:45,084
Excuse me.

1505
01:52:46,709 --> 01:52:49,584
We're around 170,000 Indians...

1506
01:52:49,792 --> 01:52:51,001
who've come from Kuwait.

1507
01:52:51,126 --> 01:52:53,376
And we've no clue what to do.

1508
01:52:53,459 --> 01:52:55,917
Look, all the people
standing outside...

1509
01:52:56,042 --> 01:52:58,251
...are waiting for
the same information.

1510
01:52:58,334 --> 01:52:59,501
You have to wait too, please.

1511
01:52:59,584 --> 01:53:00,876
Saddam has barged into our homes...

1512
01:53:00,959 --> 01:53:02,417
...and you're asking us to wait.

1513
01:53:03,001 --> 01:53:06,042
Look...no point in getting heated up.

1514
01:53:06,459 --> 01:53:08,667
I really don't know anything.

1515
01:53:08,876 --> 01:53:09,709
Please.

1516
01:53:13,917 --> 01:53:14,834
Hello.

1517
01:53:14,917 --> 01:53:16,042
Yes, from Delhi.

1518
01:53:16,417 --> 01:53:17,334
Yes.

1519
01:53:18,042 --> 01:53:19,084
Yes, sir.

1520
01:53:19,167 --> 01:53:20,292
Okay, sir.

1521
01:53:20,417 --> 01:53:23,126
Okay, sir.
Thank you.

1522
01:53:50,001 --> 01:54:02,126
"The one you forgot...
kept remembering you."

1523
01:54:04,209 --> 01:54:09,209
"You kept living on..."

1524
01:54:09,917 --> 01:54:16,501
"...and he kept dying for you."

1525
01:54:16,917 --> 01:54:23,792
"When he heard you moan with pain..."

1526
01:54:24,501 --> 01:54:31,001
"...he came to your rescue,
leaving everything behind."

1527
01:54:31,084 --> 01:54:37,542
"With happiness in your path."

1528
01:54:38,501 --> 01:54:44,751
"He's with you at every turn."

1529
01:54:45,084 --> 01:54:51,126
"Leaving everything behind."

1530
01:54:53,626 --> 01:54:58,417
"The one you forgot...
kept remembering you."

1531
01:54:59,292 --> 01:55:05,334
"Each of his moment
passed worrying about you."

1532
01:55:38,626 --> 01:55:39,292
Next.

1533
01:55:39,459 --> 01:55:40,834
Behram Poonawala.

1534
01:55:44,792 --> 01:55:45,542
Yes, next.

1535
01:55:45,626 --> 01:55:47,626
Meher Poonawala.
- Daljit Singh.

1536
01:55:52,167 --> 01:55:52,792
Next.

1537
01:55:53,376 --> 01:55:54,709
Your name?

1538
01:55:56,167 --> 01:55:57,334
Ma'am, what's your name?

1539
01:55:57,792 --> 01:55:58,709
Shazin.

1540
01:55:59,084 --> 01:56:00,001
Shazin what?

1541
01:56:00,667 --> 01:56:01,834
Shazin. Durrani.

1542
01:56:02,084 --> 01:56:04,501
And you?
- Ibrahim Durrani.

1543
01:56:05,042 --> 01:56:06,209
Husband-wife?

1544
01:56:09,501 --> 01:56:15,709
"Each of his moment
passed worrying about you."

1545
01:56:16,542 --> 01:56:22,876
"The world was with you...
while he was all alone."

1546
01:56:23,584 --> 01:56:30,001
"Each of his moment
passed worrying about you."

1547
01:56:30,626 --> 01:56:36,542
"The world was with you...
while he was all alone."

1548
01:56:36,876 --> 01:56:50,292
"The tears that were..."

1549
01:56:50,542 --> 01:56:53,667
"With happiness in your path."

1550
01:56:54,001 --> 01:56:56,376
How did you decide the seating?

1551
01:56:56,876 --> 01:56:59,126
Meaning, who sits in first class...

1552
01:56:59,167 --> 01:57:00,501
...and who sits in economy?

1553
01:57:00,667 --> 01:57:01,917
Well, I'll just check on that, sir.

1554
01:57:02,001 --> 01:57:02,876
Excuse me.

1555
01:57:03,501 --> 01:57:05,542
Otherwise it's very unfair.

1556
01:57:07,167 --> 01:57:07,834
Kohli.

1557
01:57:10,334 --> 01:57:11,459
Congratulations.

1558
01:57:11,876 --> 01:57:13,667
The first flight's about to take-off.

1559
01:57:25,376 --> 01:57:30,001
"Vande Mataram!"

1560
01:57:32,417 --> 01:57:36,417
"Vande Mataram!"

1561
01:57:36,917 --> 01:57:38,834
The World's biggest rescue operation.

1562
01:57:39,126 --> 01:57:40,501
Air India, Indian Airlines...

1563
01:57:40,709 --> 01:57:44,251
...and Indian Air Force
pilots flew 488 such flights.

1564
01:57:44,626 --> 01:57:47,584
The world has never witnessed nor will
probably ever witness...

1565
01:57:47,917 --> 01:57:50,667
a rescue operation of this scale:

1566
01:57:51,126 --> 01:57:53,667
India brought home, over a 100,000 of
her citizens

1567
01:57:54,001 --> 01:57:55,417
...who were stuck in another country.

1568
01:57:56,501 --> 01:57:59,251
And we've brought our
people back safe and sound.

1569
01:58:02,251 --> 01:58:03,667
Congratulations, sir.
- Thank you.

1570
01:58:03,751 --> 01:58:05,584
Thank you.
- You did it.

1571
01:58:07,417 --> 01:58:11,626
Those we never met, and never
got the chance to meet later...

1572
01:58:12,459 --> 01:58:15,167
Many government officers
like Sanjeev Kohli...

1573
01:58:15,459 --> 01:58:16,751
...made this possible.

1574
01:58:18,126 --> 01:58:19,667
Birdy flew.

1575
01:58:20,501 --> 01:58:21,584
Plane flew.

1576
01:58:23,251 --> 01:58:24,751
Simu flew.

1577
01:58:24,834 --> 01:58:26,001
Mom flew.

1578
01:58:26,376 --> 01:58:28,876
I flew.
How can I fly?

1579
01:58:42,792 --> 01:58:47,501
"The one you forgot...
kept remembering you."

1580
01:58:48,751 --> 01:58:51,167
Even today I get upset
over some problems in India.

1581
01:58:51,501 --> 01:58:52,626
I am still cynical.

1582
01:58:52,917 --> 01:58:55,251
But after boarding that last flight...

1583
01:58:55,709 --> 01:58:59,209
...l have never asked, what
has my country done for me.

1584
01:59:33,126 --> 01:59:46,626
"The one you forgot...
kept remembering you."

1585
01:59:47,334 --> 01:59:52,251
"You kept living on..."

1586
01:59:53,084 --> 01:59:59,501
"...and he kept dying for you."

1587
02:00:00,126 --> 02:00:06,917
"When he heard you moan with pain..."

1588
02:00:07,584 --> 02:00:13,876
"...he came to your rescue,
leaving everything behind."

1589
02:00:14,251 --> 02:00:20,959
"With happiness in your path."

1590
02:00:21,584 --> 02:00:27,751
"He's with you at every turn."

1591
02:00:28,209 --> 02:00:33,084
"Leaving everything behind."

1592
02:00:36,751 --> 02:00:48,501
"The one you forgot...
kept remembering you."

1593
02:01:52,584 --> 02:01:58,709
"Each of his moment
passed worrying about you."

1594
02:01:59,709 --> 02:02:06,417
"The world was with you...
while he was all alone."

1595
02:02:06,667 --> 02:02:13,334
"Each of his moment
passed worrying about you."

1596
02:02:13,751 --> 02:02:19,792
"The world was with you...
while he was all alone."

1597
02:02:20,042 --> 02:02:33,292
"The tears that were..."

1598
02:02:33,709 --> 02:02:40,376
"With happiness in your path."

1599
02:02:41,084 --> 02:02:50,501
How did you decide the seating?

1600
02:02:56,126 --> 02:03:08,459
"The one you forgot...
kept remembering you."
