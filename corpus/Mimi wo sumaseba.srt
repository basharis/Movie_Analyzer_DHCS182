8
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:03,414
- Hello.
- Hot, isn't it.

9
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:08,461
I'm home.

10
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:13,591
Thanks.

11
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:17,178
You don't need a bag for just milk!

12
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:18,846
They put it in one.

13
00:02:19,181 --> 00:02:22,016
Just say 'no'!
Pour me some, too.

14
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:24,352
Dad, want some barley tea?

15
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:27,438
Please...I'll come there.

16
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:32,151
- Thanks. The word processor open?
- I'm still printing.

17
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:35,696
I should buy an electronic notebook.

18
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:38,699
You smoke too much.

19
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:41,327
You could've gone to your aunt's, too.

20
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:44,372
No. Shiho wears me out.

21
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:47,166
Oh, I've got work tomorrow.

22
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:48,709
Do you need lunch?

23
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:50,503
No, I'll eat out.

24
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:54,548
The library's busy going to
a bar-code system.

25
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:58,010
I like the book-cards better.

26
00:02:58,762 --> 00:03:00,221
Me, too.

27
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:02,723
Hey, this isn't right...

28
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:04,225
What?

29
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:07,728
Did you leave out a line?

30
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:10,398
You're right!

31
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:13,984
Let me go first. I have to
get this right or my prof will complain.

32
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:17,780
Seiji Amasawa

33
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,573
This guy...

34
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:23,619
You can read,
but don't stay up too late.

35
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:24,704
Good night.

36
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:36,590
I thought I'd seen that name before...

37
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:40,553
Here, too...

38
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:48,060
Seiji Amasawa

39
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:52,064
He's taken all these books out
before me.

40
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:04,994
Seiji Amasawa...what's he like?
Wonder if he's nice.

41
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:15,463
Seiji Amasawa

42
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:26,056
Shizuku! Get up!

43
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:27,808
I'm leaving!

44
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:33,481
Did you sleep in your clothes?
Put the rice on.

45
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,150
'Bye!

46
00:04:39,321 --> 00:04:42,239
Oh, no! I've got to meet Yuko!

47
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:46,243
My purse...

48
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:49,663
You ran back upstairs again?

49
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:50,790
Yeah.

50
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,626
That's funny...

51
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,711
Try by the phone...

52
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:57,379
Yes!

53
00:04:57,506 --> 00:04:59,006
...where you left it.

54
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,675
I'm late! Lock the door!

55
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:03,344
Clumsy!

56
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:14,355
It's flying so low!

57
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:20,861
Today's a lucky day!

58
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:48,055
Is it ever hot!

59
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:58,691
How's it going?

60
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,880
Hit it!

61
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:23,799
Hi, Shizuku!

62
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:27,553
Hi! Keep it up!

63
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:32,766
Miss Kosaka?

64
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,769
Tsukishima?
What are you doing here?

65
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:38,272
Could I ask a favor?

66
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:40,774
Nothing weird, I hope...

67
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:42,443
Let me in the library!

68
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:43,736
What?

69
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:46,113
Can't you wait till school starts?

70
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:49,909
I've read all my books,
and the public library's closed.

71
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:54,079
I'm reading 20 before school starts.

72
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:58,292
20? You've got high-school
entrance exams, don't forget.

73
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,044
Hurry it up!

74
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:02,046
Here it is!

75
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:03,297
Bring it here.

76
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:08,469
Give me your card and the book card.

77
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:10,554
Yes, ma'am.

78
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:15,225
No one's ever borrowed this book!

79
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:19,813
It's rare. They don't even have it
at the public library.

80
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:27,821
Donated
Amasawa's Collection

81
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:30,824
'Amasawa' ...Miss!

82
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:33,661
Do you know who this 'Amasawa' is?

83
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:36,830
Look what you made me do!

84
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,334
Someone gave it to us.
I wouldn't know him.

85
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,169
Ask an older teacher.

86
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,629
Shizuku!

87
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:49,009
What are you doing here?
I've been at the front gate since 11!

88
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:52,846
If I have to stand in the sun
I get more freckles!

89
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:53,847
Sorry!

90
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:57,518
Relax, Harada. You take freckles
much too seriously.

91
00:07:57,686 --> 00:08:00,521
They're a serious problem, Miss!

92
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:04,525
Yeah, yeah...alright, out of here,
both of you.

93
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:11,365
Move up! Move up!

94
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:18,539
I tried, but it's not going to work.
Why not just sing it in English?

95
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:23,544
'White clouds spreading up
over a hill...

96
00:08:23,712 --> 00:08:28,048
'...a road winds up to the town.'

97
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:32,469
'An old house with small windows...

98
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:36,724
'An old dog waits
for me to come home...

99
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:41,228
'Country road leading far away...

100
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:45,899
'The road to my old home town...

101
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:50,320
'West 'Ginia, my mother
the mountain...

102
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:54,825
'My good old home town.'

103
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:57,202
- That's not bad.
- Yes, it is.

104
00:08:58,079 --> 00:08:59,204
It's trite.

105
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:01,415
Yeah?

106
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,168
I wrote another one.

107
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:09,923
'Concrete roads, everywhere...

108
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:14,928
'Cut down all the trees,
filled in the valleys...

109
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:17,514
'Western Tokyo...

110
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,725
'Tama Mountain...

111
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:24,188
'My home town is concrete roads.'

112
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:27,274
What is this?!

113
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:30,235
But what's this 'problem'?

114
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:32,946
You don't need the lyrics yet...

115
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:36,450
No...are you in love with anyone?

116
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:37,701
What?

117
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:41,872
Studying for entrance exams
would be easier having someone.

118
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:43,957
We could encourage each other.

119
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:46,960
Yuko! You're in love!

120
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,256
You got a love letter?!

121
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:52,132
Shh!

122
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,384
When? Who? Is he handsome?

123
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:57,805
He's in another class. He's not bad.

124
00:09:57,931 --> 00:10:01,141
Meet him, then! If you don't like him,
just say no!

125
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:02,684
Yeah, but...

126
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:06,688
So there's someone else you like!

127
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:12,319
You can't hide it from me! Confess!

128
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,739
It's Su...Su...

129
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,574
Tsukishima!

130
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:20,160
Bring me my bag, will you?

131
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:21,620
Sugimura!

132
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:24,665
That blue sports bag.

133
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:26,667
Come on, Tsukishima!

134
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:29,211
Throw it over here.

135
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:33,090
Shut up and go back to the bench!

136
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:36,885
I'm first-string, and we're
through to the regionals!

137
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:38,137
Yuko?

138
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:53,360
You're in love with Sugimura?

139
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:57,531
What am I going to do?
The way I reacted, he might know!

140
00:10:57,699 --> 00:11:00,159
Don't worry. He's too dense.

141
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:03,704
What about the guy who wrote you?

142
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:09,877
I'll think about it a while.

143
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:11,503
I see.

144
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:15,549
At least your parents aren't
always after you to study.

145
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,177
Silence isn't always great.

146
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,053
I wonder...

147
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:22,556
- Oh, no!
- What?

148
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:25,058
I forgot my book! I'll go back.

149
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:26,143
I'll ride you.

150
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:29,062
No. You'll be late for cram school.

151
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,981
I'll call you.

152
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:11,939
That book...

153
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:15,234
Oh, is it yours?

154
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,115
Here, 'Shizuku Tsukishima'.

155
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,117
How do you know my name?

156
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:26,912
Guess!

157
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:30,624
My library card...

158
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:34,544
I'd forget about
'Concrete Road', though.

159
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,427
You read it!

160
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:45,138
Jerk! Jerk! Jerk!

161
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:49,017
Jerk! Jerk! Jerk!

162
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:54,648
Jerk!

163
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:07,619
'I'd forget about "Concrete Road"...'

164
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:09,746
Get lost!

165
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:50,037
I'm home.

166
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:54,207
Shiho? You're back already?

167
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,543
I'm beat!

168
00:13:57,253 --> 00:14:00,714
I got a ride with someone
who was coming this way.

169
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:03,467
Where's Mom?

170
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:06,553
Summer Intensive Seminar.
Dad's at work.

171
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:09,723
You could clean up a little...

172
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:11,641
What about dinner?

173
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,226
I'm going to wash the rice.

174
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:16,396
Shizuku! The breakfast things
are still out!

175
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:18,899
I'm getting to it!

176
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:24,488
Mom's busy! We've got to help!

177
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:34,247
Do the rice and put away the washing.
I'll take a shower and make dinner.

178
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:39,586
Aunt says come see her
when you get into high school.

179
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:42,506
Are you studying?

180
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:47,469
Don't think you can take it easy
just because Mom and Dad don't bug you.

181
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,596
I know!

182
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:53,767
She even wanted me
to bring home soy sauce!

183
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:55,936
That's your aunt, all right.

184
00:14:56,646 --> 00:14:59,272
It was the same thing last year.

185
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,943
Yes! It was miso! Boy, was it heavy!

186
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:05,112
Two kilos of it!

187
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:23,630
Shizuku! Get up and vacuum
by your desk!

188
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:25,966
I'm washing the sheets.

189
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,968
And airing the bedding.

190
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,637
Where's Mom?

191
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:31,972
Long gone.

192
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:39,479
Put that stuff away
and take Dad his lunch.

193
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:40,647
Me?!

194
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:44,151
Why not? You're going to the library.

195
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,571
Shall I go instead?

196
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:52,284
And you'll clean the toilet, the bath
and the balcony and go to the Co-op?

197
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:56,997
Don't forget to turn the bedding
and fix dinner.

198
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:02,169
I'm going!

199
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:10,010
Shizuku!

200
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:12,679
Mail these, will you?

201
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:14,055
What?

202
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:16,349
M-A-I-L!

203
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:24,024
You don't have to read them!

204
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:26,359
Take the paper-clip off.

205
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:27,861
Your boyfriend?

206
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:29,112
Idiot!

207
00:17:26,087 --> 00:17:27,921
Hey cat...are you alone?

208
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,927
Where are you going?

209
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:39,057
What's out there?

210
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:43,270
Hey! Answer me!

211
00:17:56,117 --> 00:17:58,243
I get off here. What about you?

212
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,040
See you.

213
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:18,888
Hey! A cat!

214
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:40,660
The library's that way!

215
00:19:04,727 --> 00:19:08,772
And it felt just like
the start of a story...

216
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:46,142
There he is!

217
00:20:11,085 --> 00:20:14,379
No Entrance

218
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:43,908
What a hill! How far up is he going?

219
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:04,262
Cat?

220
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:07,056
Cat?

221
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:13,897
Does he live around here?

222
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:49,682
Hey, cat! Where are you going?
Do you live around here?

223
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:13,331
I never knew there was a place
like this way up here...

224
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:36,062
That's not nice!
Going around teasing dogs!

225
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:51,578
Maybe you're teasing me, too.

226
00:23:44,048 --> 00:23:47,467
I never guessed there was a store
like this up here either...

227
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:18,289
Cool!

228
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:28,508
Are you that cat?

229
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:41,813
Oh, hello...

230
00:24:41,939 --> 00:24:42,981
Um...

231
00:24:43,107 --> 00:24:46,985
That's all right. Look around
all you want.

232
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:49,362
The Baron gets bored.

233
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:53,449
Is this doll 'the Baron'?

234
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:58,538
Yep. Baron Humbert von Jechingen.
Quite the name...

235
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:09,340
Sorry.

236
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:11,676
Thanks. I'm fine now.

237
00:25:11,802 --> 00:25:13,302
That's a great clock.

238
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:17,140
It was sitting in some castle,
all rusted out.

239
00:25:17,266 --> 00:25:18,349
Look...

240
00:25:21,729 --> 00:25:25,231
It's beautiful. What is it?

241
00:25:28,152 --> 00:25:30,570
Wait and see.

242
00:26:10,861 --> 00:26:13,029
What great dwarfs!

243
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:18,576
So you're a young lady
who knows about dwarfs, are you?

244
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:24,540
Watch the face...if it works.

245
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:43,643
A fairy!

246
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:46,562
The light shines on the glass.
Come up here.

247
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,069
A princess?

248
00:26:53,237 --> 00:26:54,445
That's right.

249
00:27:04,373 --> 00:27:06,415
Are they in love?

250
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:11,295
But they live in different worlds.
He's the king of the dwarfs.

251
00:27:11,922 --> 00:27:16,926
Only while the clock is striking 12
is she changed back from a sheep.

252
00:27:17,094 --> 00:27:20,805
But he appears every hour...

253
00:27:20,931 --> 00:27:22,598
...and waits for her.

254
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:28,771
The artisan who made this
must have been disappointed in love.

255
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:33,151
That's why they both look so sad...

256
00:27:36,864 --> 00:27:38,531
This clock's fast, isn't it...

257
00:27:38,699 --> 00:27:41,284
Only about five minutes, though.

258
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:42,660
Oh, no!

259
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:46,289
I've got to be at the library!

260
00:27:46,957 --> 00:27:49,041
Can I come back sometime?

261
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:53,004
Sure...but go left
to get to the library!

262
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:06,726
I'm right above it!

263
00:28:12,316 --> 00:28:15,610
What a find! A place
where stories start!

264
00:28:17,613 --> 00:28:19,030
Fantastic!

265
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:21,991
Tsukishima!

266
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:23,826
Shizuku Tsukishima!

267
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:28,247
Isn't this yours?

268
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:35,713
Forgetful, aren't you.

269
00:28:35,923 --> 00:28:37,673
Thanks...but how...?

270
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:39,550
Guess!

271
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:44,889
The cat! Is that your cat?

272
00:28:45,182 --> 00:28:47,558
You sure eat a big lunch!

273
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:50,686
No!

274
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:54,482
'Concrete roads, everywhere' ...

275
00:28:55,609 --> 00:28:57,902
It's not mine! Hey!

276
00:29:00,364 --> 00:29:01,781
Oh, here you are...

277
00:29:05,035 --> 00:29:07,286
What's wrong with you?

278
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:09,705
It's hard to explain.

279
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:14,460
I felt like I'd found
a treasure hidden in a cave.

280
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:17,296
Then what someone said
buried me alive.

281
00:29:17,506 --> 00:29:19,423
Sounds complicated.

282
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:23,302
Getting more books?

283
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:25,930
Seven more to go.

284
00:29:26,056 --> 00:29:28,474
Still at it? What about lunch?

285
00:29:28,642 --> 00:29:29,600
I'll buy something.

286
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:32,270
You will? Thanks, then.

287
00:29:54,251 --> 00:29:55,960
June 16th...

288
00:29:56,712 --> 00:30:00,089
Wow! Amasawa's read this one, too!

289
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:03,301
What's he like?

290
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:08,472
No! He's not you!

291
00:31:02,069 --> 00:31:04,487
Shizuku! Hurry!

292
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:07,239
I'm late!

293
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:09,867
Pass my umbrella.

294
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:15,706
Rain every day this term!

295
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:20,086
At least you're studying
because you want to.

296
00:31:20,337 --> 00:31:21,379
Sorry.

297
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:23,214
Study hard!

298
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:24,840
Don't you worry!

299
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:33,599
Shizuku!

300
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:34,600
Hi!

301
00:31:34,768 --> 00:31:36,352
Hurry! We'll be late!

302
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:39,897
I hate all these tests!

303
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:42,024
One every day!

304
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:48,572
Did you answer?

305
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:49,740
No.

306
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:51,242
Did he say anything?

307
00:31:52,202 --> 00:31:53,953
I'm going to say no.

308
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:57,373
Yeah? Maybe that's best.

309
00:31:57,499 --> 00:31:58,958
Sugimura!

310
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:01,710
Better hurry!

311
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:04,255
I know!

312
00:32:13,557 --> 00:32:15,975
Time's up. Gather the papers.

313
00:32:22,232 --> 00:32:23,941
See you this afternoon.

314
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:29,905
Let's go see Miss Kosaka.

315
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:31,782
Let me go to the teachers' room first.

316
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:32,908
Sure.

317
00:32:33,243 --> 00:32:35,286
- Tsukishima!
- What?

318
00:32:35,412 --> 00:32:37,580
I lucked out on the test!

319
00:32:37,706 --> 00:32:38,998
Isn't that nice.

320
00:32:39,166 --> 00:32:42,001
Everything I studied was on it!

321
00:32:42,252 --> 00:32:44,628
So you're not just a baseball goof...

322
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:49,008
Yuko's good at guessing, too.
Why not study with her?

323
00:32:49,426 --> 00:32:50,301
With Harada?

324
00:32:50,427 --> 00:32:52,511
- Hey, Sugimura!
- What?

325
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,972
Come on!

326
00:33:00,604 --> 00:33:02,480
Stop fixing me up!

327
00:33:02,606 --> 00:33:03,647
Was it obvious?

328
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:05,774
I never just guess!

329
00:33:05,901 --> 00:33:07,067
Sorry!

330
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:09,945
Excuse me...

331
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:16,869
A library-book donor?
Gee, I don't know...

332
00:33:17,037 --> 00:33:20,873
Sorry to bother you at lunch-time.
There's this stamp in it.

333
00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:23,667
Oh...

334
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:28,547
That's Dr Amasawa.

335
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:30,883
I've read it. It's a good book!

336
00:33:31,176 --> 00:33:32,343
Yes, very.

337
00:33:32,469 --> 00:33:35,387
What kind of person is he?

338
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:39,725
He was chairman of the PTA
a few years ago.

339
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:43,521
The PTA? Would you know
his given name?

340
00:33:43,647 --> 00:33:45,314
His given name?

341
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:49,860
Mr Kimura, do you remember
that Dr Amasawa's given name?

342
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:53,405
Dr Amasawa? It was 'Koichi'.

343
00:33:53,907 --> 00:33:55,407
Koichi Amasawa...

344
00:33:55,742 --> 00:34:01,080
His youngest son's in your year,
Tsukishima. You don't know him?

345
00:34:01,248 --> 00:34:03,415
He is?!

346
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:05,084
Thank you very much!

347
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:07,836
Excuse us!

348
00:34:09,089 --> 00:34:10,256
Sorry!

349
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:14,927
Shizuku, where are you going?

350
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:18,430
What a surprise!

351
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:20,391
Tell me about it!

352
00:34:20,976 --> 00:34:23,435
What's with you?!

353
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:25,604
Sorry!

354
00:34:35,115 --> 00:34:37,408
Hey, where are you going?

355
00:34:53,967 --> 00:34:56,135
He ignored me! Of all the nerve!

356
00:34:56,261 --> 00:34:59,054
Who is he? Where are you going?

357
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,890
He's a jerk! He won't make me
avoid him!

358
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:08,480
I've been carrying her lunch
all over!

359
00:35:09,983 --> 00:35:12,151
Tsukishima with a boyfriend?!

360
00:35:12,319 --> 00:35:16,655
Looks like springtime has come
for Shizuku at last!

361
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:18,657
It isn't true!

362
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:21,827
You met a prince
from one of your books?

363
00:35:21,995 --> 00:35:22,995
Is he handsome?

364
00:35:23,163 --> 00:35:25,664
I just want to find out what he's like!

365
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:30,044
Come on, Yuko, you heard his name.
Tell us!

366
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:31,837
Yuko!

367
00:35:32,005 --> 00:35:33,672
It happened too fast.

368
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:37,760
'Ma', something, 'Masaki', maybe...

369
00:35:37,886 --> 00:35:39,053
Hmm?

370
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:40,387
Hmm...

371
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:45,559
But it's like Tsukishima to run out
without hearing the end of something.

372
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:48,354
You want to know, but you don't...

373
00:35:49,189 --> 00:35:52,358
Your heart beats
in misery and ecstasy!

374
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:55,861
How terribly romantic!

375
00:35:56,529 --> 00:36:01,700
Should you really tease a girl
who has just written your lyric?

376
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:04,036
- You finished?!
- Let's see!

377
00:36:06,039 --> 00:36:10,376
O Shizuku! O great poet!
We will not transgress again!

378
00:36:11,378 --> 00:36:12,711
All right, then.

379
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,381
I'm not sure...

380
00:36:16,925 --> 00:36:22,221
I don't know about old home towns,
so I wrote about what I feel.

381
00:36:22,389 --> 00:36:24,556
This is great!

382
00:36:24,766 --> 00:36:29,895
'Country road, this old road...

383
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:35,067
'If I go right to the end...

384
00:36:35,402 --> 00:36:40,239
'Got a feeling it'll take me...

385
00:36:40,407 --> 00:36:45,160
'...to that town, country road.'

386
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:48,122
This is good, Shizuku. I like it.

387
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:49,998
It's not hard to sing?

388
00:36:50,125 --> 00:36:51,250
We'll manage.

389
00:36:51,418 --> 00:36:55,713
We can give this to the juniors
and sing it at the teachers' thank-you!

390
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:57,089
There, too?!

391
00:36:57,257 --> 00:36:58,006
Slow down!

392
00:36:58,133 --> 00:36:59,591
I like this part.

393
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:03,929
'I left because I was alone
and I had nothing...

394
00:37:04,139 --> 00:37:08,100
'Pushed away my sadness
and pretended I was strong...'

395
00:37:08,268 --> 00:37:10,436
Ladies, the bell.

396
00:37:18,111 --> 00:37:20,279
The sun's come out!

397
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:21,905
Shizuku!

398
00:37:22,282 --> 00:37:25,951
Come to the choir room!
We'll show them your lyrics.

399
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:28,454
No, I'm going to the library.

400
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:30,914
There's another test tomorrow...

401
00:37:31,124 --> 00:37:32,458
I'll study there.

402
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:33,709
Bookworm!

403
00:37:34,419 --> 00:37:35,461
'Bye

404
00:38:12,332 --> 00:38:13,499
Harada...

405
00:38:16,336 --> 00:38:19,004
Can I talk to you for a minute?

406
00:38:29,349 --> 00:38:31,016
It's closed.

407
00:38:32,352 --> 00:38:34,686
Have these flowers been watered?

408
00:38:46,533 --> 00:38:50,452
Baron's gone...maybe someone bought him.

409
00:38:56,709 --> 00:39:00,045
World Emporium; Shiro Nishi, Prop.

410
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:04,383
'Shiro Nishi' ...maybe that jerk's name
is 'Nishi', too.

411
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:20,899
Shizuku! Shizuku!

412
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:27,906
Yuko's on the phone!

413
00:39:28,575 --> 00:39:30,701
You'll go deaf, Shizuku.

414
00:39:31,244 --> 00:39:32,411
Yuko?

415
00:39:32,954 --> 00:39:35,414
What? I can't hear you.

416
00:39:36,416 --> 00:39:38,917
I'll be there in a minute.

417
00:39:39,836 --> 00:39:40,961
'Bye.

418
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:43,922
- Where are you going?
- Not far.

419
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:52,598
What's wrong?

420
00:39:53,433 --> 00:39:54,766
Shizuku!

421
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:57,603
What's the matter?

422
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:59,771
What am I going to do?!

423
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:05,611
The guy who wrote the letter got
Sugimura to ask me to answer it!

424
00:40:07,447 --> 00:40:10,115
Uh-oh...

425
00:40:11,284 --> 00:40:13,619
Why you, of all people?!

426
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:16,663
Hey!

427
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:22,377
That guy is so dense!

428
00:40:22,795 --> 00:40:26,965
But he doesn't know
how you feel about him...

429
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:35,974
I'll apologize to him. But I can't go
to school tomorrow looking like this.

430
00:40:36,184 --> 00:40:37,476
And miss the test?

431
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:38,977
Yeah.

432
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:40,979
Oh.

433
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:01,583
Idiot!

434
00:41:04,212 --> 00:41:05,504
What?

435
00:41:07,674 --> 00:41:08,924
It was easy.

436
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:11,009
The library again, Shizuku?

437
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:12,177
I'm going to Yuko's.

438
00:41:12,345 --> 00:41:14,346
Say hello.

439
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:24,690
Tsukishima!

440
00:41:26,025 --> 00:41:27,192
Wait up!

441
00:41:34,075 --> 00:41:35,867
About Harada...

442
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:48,547
...then she started crying.
Did I say something wrong?

443
00:41:50,091 --> 00:41:54,886
She said, ' Why you, of all people, '
didn't she?

444
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:58,390
Yeah. A guy on the baseball team
asked me.

445
00:41:58,725 --> 00:42:00,225
No!

446
00:42:00,393 --> 00:42:03,395
She didn't want to hear something
like that from you!

447
00:42:03,563 --> 00:42:05,188
Don't you understand?!

448
00:42:05,398 --> 00:42:06,898
No, I don't!

449
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,567
Tell me!

450
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:14,031
You really are dense, you know!
She likes you!

451
00:42:14,407 --> 00:42:18,035
What?! No way! I don't need this!

452
00:42:18,411 --> 00:42:23,540
You don't? How do you think Yuko feels?!
She stayed home sick today!

453
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:27,544
But...I like you!

454
00:42:27,754 --> 00:42:28,754
What?!

455
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:32,257
Don't make jokes
at a time like this!

456
00:42:32,425 --> 00:42:33,550
It's not a joke!

457
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:35,761
I've liked you for a long time!

458
00:42:36,763 --> 00:42:39,765
Not me! You can't!

459
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:43,101
You don't like me? Or do you have
a boyfriend?

460
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:45,687
I don't have a boyfriend...

461
00:42:46,773 --> 00:42:47,939
But...

462
00:42:48,441 --> 00:42:49,274
I'm sorry!

463
00:42:49,442 --> 00:42:50,275
Wait!

464
00:42:50,777 --> 00:42:52,778
Tell me the truth!

465
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:59,117
But we've always been friends...
I like you, but not...

466
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:04,664
I'm sorry. I can't say what I mean.

467
00:43:10,922 --> 00:43:12,672
Just friends?

468
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:16,802
Forever?

469
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:23,475
I see...

470
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:13,692
I'm the one who's dense!

471
00:44:24,537 --> 00:44:27,372
The parcel delivery left this with me.

472
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:29,875
Thank you...again!

473
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:46,391
You don't have to do this!

474
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:49,060
We couldn't eat all these ourselves.

475
00:44:49,896 --> 00:44:51,146
Oh, you're home...

476
00:44:52,398 --> 00:44:53,398
Shizuku?

477
00:46:14,313 --> 00:46:15,981
Hi.

478
00:46:17,984 --> 00:46:19,693
Have you been shut out, too?

479
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:26,950
Do you live here? Are you hungry?

480
00:46:30,496 --> 00:46:33,957
You're not very nice. Just like me.

481
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:41,923
Why do we change, I wonder?
I was always so sweet...

482
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:46,344
Books don't even excite me
like they used to.

483
00:46:46,512 --> 00:46:51,683
There's always someone inside me
saying, 'Things aren't that easy!'

484
00:46:52,018 --> 00:46:53,685
I'm not very nice.

485
00:47:19,045 --> 00:47:20,712
Hey! Tsukishima!

486
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:24,549
Moon lets you pet him?

487
00:47:25,051 --> 00:47:26,968
Moon, you're not coming in?

488
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:28,803
Is that his name?

489
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:31,056
He's like a full moon.

490
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:33,725
That's why I call him that.

491
00:47:38,064 --> 00:47:40,023
Isn't he yours?

492
00:47:40,149 --> 00:47:41,900
He won't stay in one house.

493
00:47:42,068 --> 00:47:45,320
I heard him called 'Ball' at one place.

494
00:47:45,613 --> 00:47:47,739
I'm sure there's others.

495
00:47:48,783 --> 00:47:50,700
So he does the rounds...

496
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:54,746
Yes! He commutes, on the train!

497
00:47:55,581 --> 00:47:56,539
The train?

498
00:47:56,791 --> 00:48:01,544
Yes, by himself! That's how
I came here. I followed him.

499
00:48:01,921 --> 00:48:06,549
And he brought me to a neat store,
just like out of a story.

500
00:48:07,259 --> 00:48:08,551
I insulted him.

501
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:14,057
I said he wasn't very nice.
Just like me.

502
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:17,602
You're not like Moon at all!

503
00:48:18,145 --> 00:48:21,564
He's half-devil, he is.

504
00:48:29,281 --> 00:48:30,448
- Um...
- Would you...

505
00:48:32,952 --> 00:48:36,955
Is your grandfather sick?
The store's been closed and I thought...

506
00:48:37,123 --> 00:48:41,126
He's fine. It's a weird store.
He doesn't open very often.

507
00:48:41,293 --> 00:48:43,128
I'm glad he's all right.

508
00:48:43,295 --> 00:48:47,132
I can't see Baron through the window.
Did he sell him?

509
00:48:47,299 --> 00:48:50,677
That cat doll? You want to see it?
Come on.

510
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:02,230
Close the door.

511
00:49:22,668 --> 00:49:24,836
It's like we're in the sky!

512
00:49:33,512 --> 00:49:34,512
Afraid of heights?

513
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:37,807
No, I like high places. This is great.

514
00:49:44,356 --> 00:49:46,691
This is the time it looks best.

515
00:49:46,859 --> 00:49:47,859
In here.

516
00:50:11,217 --> 00:50:12,383
Perfect timing.

517
00:50:13,219 --> 00:50:14,552
Sit there.

518
00:50:14,887 --> 00:50:16,221
The clock's gone!

519
00:50:16,555 --> 00:50:18,473
The one that was there?

520
00:50:19,391 --> 00:50:22,060
Grandpa's delivering it today.

521
00:50:22,394 --> 00:50:23,770
Did he sell it?

522
00:50:24,396 --> 00:50:26,231
It was here being fixed.

523
00:50:26,398 --> 00:50:29,317
I wanted to see it again.

524
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:33,238
It took three years. He finished it
the day you forgot your lunch.

525
00:50:33,405 --> 00:50:34,906
That lunch!

526
00:50:35,074 --> 00:50:37,742
I know it wasn't yours.

527
00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:39,953
Look into the cat's eyes.

528
00:50:42,581 --> 00:50:44,832
Quick, before the light goes.

529
00:50:57,388 --> 00:51:00,598
Engelzimmer... 'angel's room'.

530
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:04,102
The artisan accidentally
scratched it with a cloth.

531
00:51:04,228 --> 00:51:05,770
It's beautiful.

532
00:51:06,063 --> 00:51:09,274
The Baron won't go. He's a treasure.

533
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:10,942
A treasure?

534
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:15,947
It means something to him.
He won't say what, though.

535
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:19,450
Look as long as you like.
I'll be downstairs.

536
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:25,456
Turn on the light if you want.

537
00:51:38,637 --> 00:51:43,808
It's weird. I feel as if
I've known you for years.

538
00:51:43,976 --> 00:51:46,519
Sometimes I really want to see you...

539
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:53,818
You look sad today, somehow...

540
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:58,049
Had enough?

541
00:52:58,175 --> 00:53:00,051
Yeah. Thanks.

542
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:03,096
Are you making a violin?

543
00:53:03,347 --> 00:53:04,889
Uh, yeah.

544
00:53:06,517 --> 00:53:07,725
Can I see?

545
00:53:12,523 --> 00:53:13,731
It fits like this.

546
00:53:15,526 --> 00:53:18,236
You made all that? By hand?

547
00:53:18,529 --> 00:53:19,737
Sure!

548
00:53:19,905 --> 00:53:21,572
Amazing!

549
00:53:21,699 --> 00:53:24,909
The shape hasn't changed in 300 years.

550
00:53:25,077 --> 00:53:28,413
The sound comes from
the craftsman's skill.

551
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:31,582
You made all those?

552
00:53:31,917 --> 00:53:35,753
No way! There's a violin-making
class here.

553
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:38,256
But one of them is yours?

554
00:53:38,549 --> 00:53:39,424
Yeah.

555
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:41,592
Which one?

556
00:53:41,719 --> 00:53:42,760
That one.

557
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:44,804
This one?

558
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:49,934
Wow! You made this?
It's like magic!

559
00:53:50,436 --> 00:53:54,272
How can you talk like that
with a straight face?

560
00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:57,608
Why? It's what I think.

561
00:53:58,068 --> 00:54:00,445
Anyone can do that.

562
00:54:02,072 --> 00:54:03,573
I've got a long way to go.

563
00:54:10,706 --> 00:54:12,957
You can play, can't you?

564
00:54:13,125 --> 00:54:14,041
A little.

565
00:54:14,168 --> 00:54:16,627
Play for me, okay? Please!

566
00:54:16,754 --> 00:54:17,795
Listen...

567
00:54:17,963 --> 00:54:20,465
Please please please!

568
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:23,301
You have to sing, too.

569
00:54:24,636 --> 00:54:26,971
Me? I'm tone-deaf!

570
00:54:27,139 --> 00:54:28,473
Perfect!

571
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:47,492
Sing. You know this song.

572
00:55:11,517 --> 00:55:16,854
'Had a dream of
living on my own...

573
00:55:17,481 --> 00:55:22,527
'...with no fear of
being all alone.

574
00:55:22,861 --> 00:55:27,698
'Pushed my sadness
down inside of me...

575
00:55:27,866 --> 00:55:32,703
'...and pretended
I was strong as I could be.

576
00:55:32,830 --> 00:55:38,209
'Country road, this old road...

577
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:43,714
'If you go right to the end...

578
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:49,387
'Got a feeling it'll take me...

579
00:55:49,555 --> 00:55:54,559
'...to that town, country road.'

580
00:55:56,019 --> 00:56:00,606
'It doesn't matter to me
how sad I might be...

581
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:06,237
'I will never ever let
a tear show in my eye...

582
00:56:06,572 --> 00:56:12,285
'If my feet are moving faster
that's because I only want to...

583
00:56:12,452 --> 00:56:17,081
'...push away memories...

584
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:22,545
'Country road, this old road...

585
00:56:22,754 --> 00:56:28,259
'...could go right to my home town...

586
00:56:28,385 --> 00:56:33,764
'I won't go there, I can't go there...

587
00:56:33,932 --> 00:56:39,103
'...can't go down that country road.

588
00:56:39,563 --> 00:56:44,609
'Country road, when tomorrow comes...

589
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:50,448
'I'll be like I always am...

590
00:56:50,741 --> 00:56:56,120
'Want to go back there,
can't go back there...

591
00:56:56,288 --> 00:56:58,956
'Fare thee well...

592
00:57:02,628 --> 00:57:05,129
'...country road.'

593
00:57:37,329 --> 00:57:38,996
That was fun!

594
00:57:41,667 --> 00:57:41,874
I'm Shizuku Tsukishima. We met
the other day.

595
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:45,336
I'm Shizuku Tsukishima. We met
the other day.

596
00:57:47,297 --> 00:57:51,175
I was hoping you'd come back again.

597
00:57:51,677 --> 00:57:54,178
These are my musical friends.

598
00:57:54,805 --> 00:58:00,184
Nice singing. You're the lucky one
who was there when he fixed the clock...

599
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:03,521
Seiji has some pretty friends.

600
00:58:03,981 --> 00:58:08,234
'Seiji'? Are you Seiji Amasawa?

601
00:58:08,527 --> 00:58:11,737
Yeah...didn't I tell you my name?

602
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:15,533
No! It says 'Nishi' outside.

603
00:58:16,410 --> 00:58:19,537
That's Grandpa's name. I'm Amasawa.

604
00:58:19,871 --> 00:58:24,834
Oh, no! First I was buried alive,
and now the sky's fallen in!

605
00:58:25,377 --> 00:58:28,879
What difference does it make
what my name is?

606
00:58:29,006 --> 00:58:32,341
A lot! You've been calling me
by my full name!

607
00:58:32,551 --> 00:58:34,593
You never asked me mine!

608
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:36,846
I never had the chance!

609
00:58:37,222 --> 00:58:40,349
My image of Seiji Amasawa...

610
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:41,434
What?

611
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:43,519
...was someone quiet and gentle.

612
00:58:43,645 --> 00:58:45,855
You read too many books.

613
00:58:45,981 --> 00:58:48,190
So do you!

614
00:59:04,124 --> 00:59:07,209
That was fun. They're nice people.

615
00:59:07,627 --> 00:59:10,087
Come back. They'll like that.

616
00:59:10,213 --> 00:59:13,174
Just to listen. Singing's too hard.

617
00:59:13,967 --> 00:59:17,845
But you're a good violinist.
Is that what you want to do?

618
00:59:18,472 --> 00:59:20,681
There's lots as good as me.

619
00:59:20,974 --> 00:59:23,976
What I want to do is make violins.

620
00:59:24,144 --> 00:59:26,979
Yeah...you're good at that.

621
00:59:27,481 --> 00:59:31,025
There's a school for it
in Cremona, Italy.

622
00:59:31,485 --> 00:59:33,986
I want to go there.

623
00:59:34,488 --> 00:59:36,489
And not go to high school?

624
00:59:36,948 --> 00:59:43,120
My parents are dead against it.
Grandpa's my only ally.

625
00:59:55,467 --> 00:59:58,135
It must be great to know
what you want to do.

626
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:03,307
I've got no idea at all.
I just go from one day to the next.

627
01:00:03,975 --> 01:00:08,813
I don't know if I can go or not.
I fight with my parents every day.

628
01:00:09,648 --> 01:00:14,485
Even if I go, I won't know
if I have the talent until I try.

629
01:00:17,656 --> 01:00:19,073
I'll see you home.

630
01:00:19,199 --> 01:00:22,326
No, it's not far. See you.

631
01:00:23,328 --> 01:00:24,829
Tsukishima...

632
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:26,831
Yeah?

633
01:00:26,998 --> 01:00:29,125
You've got a talent for poetry.

634
01:00:29,501 --> 01:00:33,838
What you sang back there was fine,
but I liked 'Concrete Roads', too.

635
01:00:34,172 --> 01:00:36,841
You told me to forget that!

636
01:00:37,175 --> 01:00:38,676
Did I say that?

637
01:00:38,844 --> 01:00:40,010
Yes!

638
01:00:40,345 --> 01:00:41,679
I did?

639
01:00:43,682 --> 01:00:46,183
Thanks for everything. Good night.

640
01:01:05,704 --> 01:01:09,373
Don't fall asleep with
the light on again.

641
01:01:16,631 --> 01:01:19,216
When did you decide on your future?

642
01:01:19,384 --> 01:01:20,217
What?

643
01:01:20,719 --> 01:01:22,094
Your future!

644
01:01:22,554 --> 01:01:24,889
Isn't yours Suginomiya High?

645
01:01:25,056 --> 01:01:26,891
I don't mean that!

646
01:01:27,559 --> 01:01:29,894
I'm at university finding that out.

647
01:01:31,897 --> 01:01:33,063
Good night.

648
01:01:33,398 --> 01:01:34,565
Good night.

649
01:01:49,164 --> 01:01:52,416
Mom's class is canceled
so now she sleeps in!

650
01:02:02,344 --> 01:02:03,260
Morning!

651
01:02:03,428 --> 01:02:04,762
Morning!

652
01:02:05,430 --> 01:02:07,097
Run faster!

653
01:02:07,432 --> 01:02:08,933
You go ahead!

654
01:02:20,445 --> 01:02:23,614
Hour 1: Spare Period

655
01:02:27,118 --> 01:02:28,327
Great!

656
01:02:28,954 --> 01:02:30,454
Shizuku!

657
01:02:30,789 --> 01:02:32,289
You look awful!

658
01:02:32,457 --> 01:02:35,125
You sure got better fast!

659
01:02:35,293 --> 01:02:37,962
I hear you were out with
a boy last night.

660
01:02:38,129 --> 01:02:40,130
Who told you that?!

661
01:02:40,298 --> 01:02:43,050
A little bird...who said
you were like lovers.

662
01:02:43,176 --> 01:02:44,635
We are not!

663
01:02:52,811 --> 01:02:56,981
Harada...I'll tell my friend
the answer's no. Sorry.

664
01:02:57,315 --> 01:02:59,984
I'm sorry, too.

665
01:03:00,318 --> 01:03:01,610
That's okay.

666
01:03:06,199 --> 01:03:09,994
Did you see Sasuke on TV
last night? It was great!

667
01:03:17,294 --> 01:03:21,338
This formula will be on the mid-term,
so remember it!

668
01:03:23,341 --> 01:03:24,341
That's all!

669
01:03:45,030 --> 01:03:47,031
Is Tsukishima here?

670
01:03:48,199 --> 01:03:49,700
Amasawa? What do you want?

671
01:03:50,368 --> 01:03:52,202
Is Tsukishima in this class?

672
01:03:52,704 --> 01:03:55,581
Tsukishima? Yeah, she's here.

673
01:03:55,874 --> 01:03:58,208
Tsukishima! You've got a visitor!

674
01:03:58,376 --> 01:03:59,376
A male!

675
01:04:04,215 --> 01:04:05,716
There she is.

676
01:04:08,219 --> 01:04:09,511
Seiji?

677
01:04:10,055 --> 01:04:12,056
Can I talk to you?

678
01:04:12,724 --> 01:04:14,058
Yes!

679
01:04:14,225 --> 01:04:17,561
Tsukishima's got a boyfriend!

680
01:04:20,732 --> 01:04:23,567
No, I don't!

681
01:04:30,408 --> 01:04:31,909
What is it?

682
01:04:32,077 --> 01:04:34,411
I'm going to Italy.

683
01:04:34,579 --> 01:04:35,579
What?

684
01:04:36,247 --> 01:04:37,414
Come with me.

685
01:04:41,753 --> 01:04:44,171
- Where are we going?
- The roof!

686
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:53,097
Wow!

687
01:04:53,932 --> 01:04:58,268
We can't talk with all those
people around.

688
01:04:58,603 --> 01:05:02,064
Sorry. I wanted to tell you first.

689
01:05:04,609 --> 01:05:07,778
Let them think what they want.

690
01:05:08,446 --> 01:05:12,282
My dad finally gave in. On one condition.

691
01:05:12,784 --> 01:05:14,284
What's that?

692
01:05:14,953 --> 01:05:19,456
I apprentice in a workshop there
for two months.

693
01:05:20,291 --> 01:05:21,291
Apprentice?

694
01:05:21,626 --> 01:05:25,963
The guy who runs it's very strict.
He'll see if I have talent or not.

695
01:05:26,631 --> 01:05:30,300
Also if I have the patience
to stick it out.

696
01:05:30,468 --> 01:05:33,303
Otherwise I go to high school.

697
01:05:33,805 --> 01:05:37,307
I hate that they're leaving
an escape route...

698
01:05:37,642 --> 01:05:39,143
...but it's a good chance.

699
01:05:39,310 --> 01:05:40,978
When do you go?

700
01:05:41,312 --> 01:05:45,816
As soon as I get my passport.
Dad's talking to the school today.

701
01:05:45,984 --> 01:05:47,651
Soon, then...

702
01:05:49,237 --> 01:05:51,321
Great! Your dream's coming true.

703
01:05:51,573 --> 01:05:54,658
Well, I'll do the best I can.

704
01:05:57,162 --> 01:05:58,162
- Um...
- Well...

705
01:06:01,166 --> 01:06:02,499
The rain's stopping.

706
01:06:02,834 --> 01:06:03,667
Yeah...

707
01:06:04,502 --> 01:06:06,336
Look over there.

708
01:06:12,177 --> 01:06:13,844
There might be a rainbow...

709
01:06:25,315 --> 01:06:30,068
What's Cremona like? I hope it's nice.

710
01:06:30,487 --> 01:06:35,866
It's an old town,
with lots of violin makers.

711
01:06:36,034 --> 01:06:39,870
It's great. You're on your way.

712
01:06:40,455 --> 01:06:42,372
I feel like a fool.

713
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:46,043
I was hoping we'd go
to the same high school...

714
01:06:47,170 --> 01:06:49,713
What a stupid thing to think...

715
01:07:07,482 --> 01:07:12,069
I saw your name on the library cards
a long time ago.

716
01:07:12,904 --> 01:07:16,073
We passed each other in the library.

717
01:07:17,283 --> 01:07:20,077
I even sat beside you there.

718
01:07:21,454 --> 01:07:26,917
I read all kinds of books so my name
would be on the cards before yours.

719
01:07:28,545 --> 01:07:29,753
I...

720
01:07:31,172 --> 01:07:34,883
I'll sing your song to myself
in Italy.

721
01:07:39,681 --> 01:07:41,098
Me, too.

722
01:07:43,184 --> 01:07:44,768
Don't push!

723
01:07:51,109 --> 01:07:52,776
Hey!

724
01:07:55,071 --> 01:07:57,281
Look out, she's mad!

725
01:07:59,284 --> 01:08:00,450
Run!

726
01:08:34,485 --> 01:08:35,569
- Here.
- Thanks.

727
01:08:35,695 --> 01:08:36,695
Excuse me.

728
01:08:36,821 --> 01:08:39,323
Finished already?

729
01:08:40,325 --> 01:08:41,992
I'm meeting Yuko.

730
01:08:44,829 --> 01:08:47,331
If you're by the station, get some milk.

731
01:08:49,334 --> 01:08:51,668
You're the one who drinks it all!

732
01:08:52,503 --> 01:08:55,339
She's slacking off these days.

733
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:18,195
- Did I make you skip cram school?
- It's alright.

734
01:09:18,363 --> 01:09:20,030
My head's in a whirl.

735
01:09:21,032 --> 01:09:22,532
Hello, Shizuku.

736
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:23,867
Hello.

737
01:09:26,871 --> 01:09:28,038
Hi.

738
01:09:28,373 --> 01:09:29,706
Hello.

739
01:09:31,376 --> 01:09:33,710
I'll make some tea.

740
01:09:35,046 --> 01:09:38,548
Dad and I aren't speaking.

741
01:09:44,972 --> 01:09:47,224
Boys are so lucky!

742
01:09:48,893 --> 01:09:54,398
When he comes back to graduate,
he goes again for ten years!

743
01:09:54,649 --> 01:09:56,733
That's like forever!

744
01:09:57,735 --> 01:10:01,571
But it's like fate
brought you together! Cool!

745
01:10:01,739 --> 01:10:06,743
It's too good to last.
Two people read the same books...

746
01:10:06,869 --> 01:10:10,622
...except one's going forward
while the other stays behind.

747
01:10:11,207 --> 01:10:12,582
Yeah...

748
01:10:13,251 --> 01:10:16,878
Kinuyo was in his class for a year.

749
01:10:17,004 --> 01:10:21,633
She said he was hard to get to know,
but good-looking and smart.

750
01:10:21,926 --> 01:10:25,762
Don't tell me that, will you!

751
01:10:25,930 --> 01:10:27,639
I just feel worse!

752
01:10:27,932 --> 01:10:31,268
Why? He likes you, doesn't he?
He told you!

753
01:10:31,436 --> 01:10:33,437
Now I'm not so sure...

754
01:10:36,774 --> 01:10:42,654
I don't get it. I'd write every day...
we'd encourage each other...

755
01:10:43,781 --> 01:10:47,159
You can't say 'go for it'
to someone more ambitious than you.

756
01:10:47,535 --> 01:10:49,119
Maybe...

757
01:10:50,496 --> 01:10:54,166
But I don't understand
what you want.

758
01:10:54,333 --> 01:10:57,586
Can't you be in love without
your future planned out?

759
01:10:59,797 --> 01:11:01,798
You have talent.

760
01:11:01,966 --> 01:11:05,635
All the juniors liked
your translation of 'Country Roads'.

761
01:11:06,304 --> 01:11:09,473
You can express yourself, too...
unlike me.

762
01:11:11,893 --> 01:11:14,269
'There's lots as good as me'.

763
01:11:14,729 --> 01:11:16,688
That's what he said.

764
01:11:16,814 --> 01:11:20,942
He's going to find out if he has talent.
Well, so will I!

765
01:11:23,404 --> 01:11:25,947
I'll write a story!

766
01:11:26,157 --> 01:11:29,785
There's one I want to write.
If he can do it, so can I.

767
01:11:30,995 --> 01:11:32,370
But it's exam time...

768
01:11:32,497 --> 01:11:36,625
I don't care. Thanks, Yuko.
I feel empowered.

769
01:11:37,001 --> 01:11:38,460
- You going?
- Yeah.

770
01:11:42,423 --> 01:11:43,632
Good night.

771
01:11:44,175 --> 01:11:46,134
Tell your mother hello.

772
01:11:49,889 --> 01:11:51,306
You go for it, too.

773
01:11:52,892 --> 01:11:57,020
Sugimura will realize.

774
01:11:57,605 --> 01:11:58,647
'Bye.

775
01:12:00,608 --> 01:12:04,736
It's so easy! I just have to
do something, too!

776
01:12:08,699 --> 01:12:09,825
Moon?

777
01:12:13,162 --> 01:12:15,497
Muta?

778
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:19,334
Mom! Muta's gone again!

779
01:12:19,627 --> 01:12:21,002
Muta!

780
01:12:21,796 --> 01:12:23,171
'Muta' ...

781
01:12:25,883 --> 01:12:31,847
'Whisper of the Heart':
Listen to the voice of the woods...

782
01:12:56,497 --> 01:12:59,249
The Baron as the hero?

783
01:12:59,834 --> 01:13:01,710
Would you mind?

784
01:13:02,086 --> 01:13:07,048
I ask because Seiji says
the doll is a treasure of yours...

785
01:13:08,509 --> 01:13:10,260
You didn't have to ask!

786
01:13:10,845 --> 01:13:14,389
Of course you can.
But on one condition.

787
01:13:15,892 --> 01:13:16,766
Yes?

788
01:13:17,184 --> 01:13:21,897
That you let me be the first person
to read your story.

789
01:13:22,690 --> 01:13:24,232
Um...

790
01:13:24,859 --> 01:13:26,234
All right?

791
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:31,573
Do I have to? I don't know
if I can write it or not...

792
01:13:34,368 --> 01:13:37,245
It's the same for a craftsman.

793
01:13:37,371 --> 01:13:40,582
Don't expect perfection at first.

794
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,627
Here, let me show you something.

795
01:13:50,217 --> 01:13:51,593
This.

796
01:13:55,723 --> 01:13:56,932
Look at it.

797
01:14:05,316 --> 01:14:07,776
It's called 'mica slate'.

798
01:14:07,985 --> 01:14:10,278
Look at the seam.

799
01:14:10,738 --> 01:14:12,447
Like that...

800
01:14:23,417 --> 01:14:24,876
It's beautiful!

801
01:14:25,252 --> 01:14:30,131
It's called 'beryl'.
You find it in emerald ore.

802
01:14:30,508 --> 01:14:32,384
Emerald? The jewel?

803
01:14:32,510 --> 01:14:33,259
Yes.

804
01:14:33,386 --> 01:14:36,972
You and Seiji are like this stone.

805
01:14:37,264 --> 01:14:40,308
Rough, unpolished, still natural.

806
01:14:40,851 --> 01:14:43,812
I like stones that way.

807
01:14:44,021 --> 01:14:48,817
But making violins, or writing stories,
is different.

808
01:14:49,694 --> 01:14:54,322
The rough stone is inside you.
You have to find it and then polish it.

809
01:14:54,865 --> 01:14:56,408
It takes time and effort.

810
01:14:57,535 --> 01:15:00,870
You see the ore that makes up
most of that stone?

811
01:15:01,539 --> 01:15:02,205
Yes.

812
01:15:02,707 --> 01:15:07,711
You could polish that,
but what you'd get would be worthless.

813
01:15:08,212 --> 01:15:11,381
The smaller part inside is purer.

814
01:15:12,049 --> 01:15:16,886
There might even be a better stone
deep inside where we can't see.

815
01:15:17,388 --> 01:15:21,683
I'm sorry. Old people
like to preach.

816
01:15:23,561 --> 01:15:27,731
I'm scared. What if there isn't
a beautiful crystal in me?

817
01:15:28,566 --> 01:15:32,569
But I want to write. And you'll be
the first one to see it.

818
01:15:32,695 --> 01:15:35,780
Thank you. I'll look forward to it.

819
01:15:44,206 --> 01:15:47,917
A rough stone...lapis lazuli...

820
01:15:52,089 --> 01:15:54,424
Let us go forth together...

821
01:15:54,925 --> 01:15:57,594
...in search of the treasure
of lapis lazuli!

822
01:15:59,597 --> 01:16:03,767
Have no fear. Space is deformed
on the night of the new moon.

823
01:16:07,104 --> 01:16:10,940
Faraway things loom large,
nearby things look small.

824
01:16:14,361 --> 01:16:17,113
Fly! We will rise on the updraft.

825
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:26,456
Make haste! The planetoids converge!

826
01:16:39,053 --> 01:16:41,137
Good! We're riding the wind!

827
01:16:42,556 --> 01:16:44,682
Straight up to that castle!

828
01:16:45,309 --> 01:16:46,810
It's so high!

829
01:16:46,936 --> 01:16:49,646
It's not so high once you're there!

830
01:17:08,624 --> 01:17:13,670
Go! When the air currents mingle
in the afternoon, you can touch the stars!

831
01:17:15,673 --> 01:17:16,506
Huh?

832
01:17:20,761 --> 01:17:25,515
That's rare! Shizuku looking at
non-fiction...

833
01:18:04,722 --> 01:18:07,849
He's making a violin in his cell...

834
01:18:40,716 --> 01:18:42,091
Seiji!

835
01:18:42,927 --> 01:18:45,261
I thought you'd gone!

836
01:18:45,429 --> 01:18:48,264
Grandpa said I might find you here.

837
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:52,101
I leave tomorrow.

838
01:18:52,770 --> 01:18:53,937
Tomorrow...

839
01:18:55,940 --> 01:19:00,276
Don't worry. I'll wait here
till you're done.

840
01:19:26,804 --> 01:19:28,638
Sorry I can't walk you home.

841
01:19:28,973 --> 01:19:32,100
That's okay. I'm glad you came.

842
01:19:32,601 --> 01:19:35,478
I can't come to the airport,
but I'll wait for you.

843
01:19:35,646 --> 01:19:38,064
It's only two months.

844
01:19:44,655 --> 01:19:50,368
I'm sorry I'm always so depressing.
I'll do my best while you're gone.

845
01:19:58,002 --> 01:19:59,669
I'll see you, then.

846
01:20:02,506 --> 01:20:04,674
Have a good trip!

847
01:20:22,818 --> 01:20:28,031
Luisa, my betrothed, and I
were born in a distant land.

848
01:20:32,703 --> 01:20:35,538
In that town, magic still lived...

849
01:20:36,206 --> 01:20:40,877
...and in the veins of its artisans
flowed the blood of sorcerers.

850
01:20:47,217 --> 01:20:52,055
It was a poor doll-maker's apprentice
who fashioned us...

851
01:20:54,058 --> 01:20:58,227
...but Luisa and I were happy...

852
01:20:59,396 --> 01:21:02,565
...because he had made us
so we could love others.

853
01:21:03,734 --> 01:21:04,901
But then...

854
01:21:11,909 --> 01:21:12,909
Shizuku...

855
01:21:13,577 --> 01:21:14,702
Shizuku!

856
01:21:16,455 --> 01:21:17,580
Shizuku!

857
01:21:20,250 --> 01:21:23,378
What's going on? Tsukishima!

858
01:21:24,588 --> 01:21:26,923
I'm sorry. I wasn't listening.

859
01:21:27,091 --> 01:21:29,592
Pay attention! This is important!

860
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:30,760
Sorry, sir.

861
01:21:30,928 --> 01:21:32,762
Harada, you read.

862
01:21:35,766 --> 01:21:38,434
You were up until 4 again?!

863
01:21:38,602 --> 01:21:41,270
It's okay. I'm not sleepy at all.

864
01:21:41,397 --> 01:21:46,359
But you're spaced out all the time!
Like just now...

865
01:21:46,485 --> 01:21:50,822
I was thinking. I've got to organize
what I want to write.

866
01:21:53,117 --> 01:21:54,951
I'm not hungry.

867
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:26,315
Shizuku? So you are home...

868
01:22:26,817 --> 01:22:28,985
Turn on the lights!

869
01:22:29,486 --> 01:22:32,989
At least you could bring in
the laundry!

870
01:22:33,574 --> 01:22:36,409
Shizuku! Come here!

871
01:22:39,329 --> 01:22:41,789
Shizuku's here, isn't she?

872
01:22:42,291 --> 01:22:43,916
She's not hungry.

873
01:23:08,525 --> 01:23:11,694
- Thank you for coming.
- Sorry to trouble you.

874
01:23:11,862 --> 01:23:15,448
This way...is anyone in
the guidance office?

875
01:23:17,034 --> 01:23:18,034
Please.

876
01:23:24,208 --> 01:23:25,541
I'm back!

877
01:23:28,879 --> 01:23:30,046
Hello.

878
01:23:30,881 --> 01:23:32,715
You're home early, Shiho.

879
01:23:34,343 --> 01:23:36,552
I'm beat!

880
01:23:36,887 --> 01:23:37,887
Want some coffee?

881
01:23:38,055 --> 01:23:39,222
Yes, please.

882
01:23:42,059 --> 01:23:44,894
Mom, can I talk to you?

883
01:23:45,229 --> 01:23:46,229
What?

884
01:23:51,568 --> 01:23:53,903
I'm thinking of moving out.

885
01:23:54,738 --> 01:23:56,239
I've found a place.

886
01:23:56,406 --> 01:23:58,574
But can you afford it?

887
01:23:58,909 --> 01:24:01,077
I've saved from my job.

888
01:24:01,411 --> 01:24:04,872
I found another one
at a cram school. I'll get by.

889
01:24:05,582 --> 01:24:09,418
I guess I've made you help me out
too much around here.

890
01:24:10,087 --> 01:24:12,588
I'll talk to your father.

891
01:24:13,090 --> 01:24:15,258
You will? Great!

892
01:24:17,553 --> 01:24:21,597
Money's tight till I graduate
in the spring and get working...

893
01:24:21,765 --> 01:24:23,599
...but I'll help you out then.

894
01:24:23,934 --> 01:24:25,476
Sounds good.

895
01:24:25,936 --> 01:24:28,604
Sorry to go during
your master's thesis...

896
01:24:28,772 --> 01:24:29,939
Thanks.

897
01:24:30,524 --> 01:24:34,068
You helped enough just with
sorting out data.

898
01:24:34,444 --> 01:24:39,865
And Shizuku can concentrate
in her own room. She's acting weird.

899
01:24:39,992 --> 01:24:41,617
You think so too?

900
01:24:42,619 --> 01:24:45,830
The school called me. Look at this.

901
01:24:46,456 --> 01:24:47,790
What is it?

902
01:24:49,042 --> 01:24:52,128
She's gone down a hundred places!

903
01:24:53,297 --> 01:24:57,300
She's at her desk all the time...
what's she doing?

904
01:25:05,642 --> 01:25:06,475
Good evening.

905
01:25:06,643 --> 01:25:08,311
Hello.

906
01:25:10,731 --> 01:25:11,981
Excuse me.

907
01:25:17,654 --> 01:25:21,073
What high school will take you
with marks like this?!

908
01:25:21,199 --> 01:25:23,492
I'm not going to high school!

909
01:25:23,660 --> 01:25:29,457
Use your head! What can you do
with a middle-school education?

910
01:25:29,666 --> 01:25:32,043
I can decide my own future!

911
01:25:32,336 --> 01:25:33,586
Watch your mouth!

912
01:25:33,712 --> 01:25:38,299
Face the facts! The school makes
its report on you after the second term!

913
01:25:38,425 --> 01:25:40,551
You're a fine one to talk!

914
01:25:40,719 --> 01:25:43,679
You don't study!
You just work part-time!

915
01:25:43,847 --> 01:25:46,182
I do what I have to!

916
01:25:46,725 --> 01:25:51,103
You're the one who isn't doing that!
Don't you understand?

917
01:25:51,563 --> 01:25:55,066
I've got something more important to do!

918
01:25:55,359 --> 01:25:58,194
Like what? Tell me.

919
01:25:59,696 --> 01:26:02,531
Shiho, Shizuku...that's enough.

920
01:26:02,699 --> 01:26:06,077
But Dad...listen to this girl!

921
01:26:06,203 --> 01:26:09,705
Both of you come out here
and tell me about it.

922
01:26:09,873 --> 01:26:12,541
Shizuku, change out of your uniform.

923
01:26:14,878 --> 01:26:16,045
Come on.

924
01:26:30,143 --> 01:26:34,063
I see. Is it true what Shiho says?

925
01:26:34,231 --> 01:26:36,399
I do so care about my marks!

926
01:26:36,566 --> 01:26:38,901
You just said you weren't going
to high school.

927
01:26:39,069 --> 01:26:41,737
You said I wouldn't get into one!

928
01:26:41,905 --> 01:26:46,409
Shiho...can Shizuku and I talk
alone for a bit?

929
01:26:46,535 --> 01:26:47,493
Yes.

930
01:26:50,122 --> 01:26:51,247
Where's your mother?

931
01:26:51,415 --> 01:26:52,748
At the Tanakas.

932
01:26:53,417 --> 01:26:54,250
I'm back.

933
01:26:54,418 --> 01:26:56,460
Hi, Mom.

934
01:26:56,586 --> 01:26:57,920
Is your dad back?

935
01:26:58,922 --> 01:27:03,092
Could you come here, Asako?
I've been hearing about Shizuku.

936
01:27:03,260 --> 01:27:04,427
Coming.

937
01:27:10,434 --> 01:27:12,268
All right, Shizuku...

938
01:27:14,271 --> 01:27:18,482
Is what you're doing now
more important than studying?

939
01:27:20,444 --> 01:27:22,945
Can you tell me what it is?

940
01:27:23,947 --> 01:27:25,781
When it's time.

941
01:27:26,283 --> 01:27:30,327
Is this something you have to do
right away?

942
01:27:30,620 --> 01:27:33,956
I've only got three weeks left
to do it!

943
01:27:34,458 --> 01:27:37,793
I'm testing myself.

944
01:27:38,295 --> 01:27:39,336
I have to.

945
01:27:39,629 --> 01:27:42,798
Testing yourself? How?

946
01:27:44,801 --> 01:27:47,011
How will we know if you don't say?

947
01:27:48,972 --> 01:27:51,849
Is it something you can't even
tell us?

948
01:27:53,310 --> 01:27:54,143
Seiya!

949
01:27:54,311 --> 01:27:56,312
Oh...sorry.

950
01:28:06,114 --> 01:28:12,661
Whatever you're doing at the library,
I admire how hard you're working.

951
01:28:13,705 --> 01:28:16,665
Let's let her do what she wants.

952
01:28:17,876 --> 01:28:20,503
Not everyone has to be the same.

953
01:28:22,172 --> 01:28:26,675
I should know that
if anyone does...

954
01:28:28,094 --> 01:28:31,514
Okay, Shizuku, do what you believe in.

955
01:28:32,474 --> 01:28:36,685
But it's not easy
when you walk your own road.

956
01:28:37,354 --> 01:28:39,855
You've only got yourself to blame.

957
01:28:41,858 --> 01:28:44,860
And join us at mealtimes, all right?

958
01:28:45,028 --> 01:28:46,862
Yeah. We're a family.

959
01:28:47,030 --> 01:28:48,030
Yes.

960
01:28:48,532 --> 01:28:50,032
Call Shiho.

961
01:28:53,203 --> 01:28:54,370
I'll make some tea.

962
01:28:57,707 --> 01:28:58,874
Shizuku...

963
01:29:00,710 --> 01:29:05,339
I know what Dad said, but what
he really wants is for you to study.

964
01:29:05,465 --> 01:29:08,342
I know. It's written on his face.

965
01:29:08,552 --> 01:29:11,720
I'm moving out next Sunday.

966
01:29:12,639 --> 01:29:14,348
You'll have your own room.

967
01:29:14,558 --> 01:29:16,225
You're leaving home?

968
01:29:16,393 --> 01:29:18,435
Yep. So smarten up!

969
01:29:29,531 --> 01:29:30,531
Hurry!

970
01:29:31,241 --> 01:29:32,908
Hurry!

971
01:29:34,536 --> 01:29:36,912
Only the one is real.

972
01:29:37,247 --> 01:29:39,456
Which is the real one?!

973
01:29:39,749 --> 01:29:40,666
Hurry!

974
01:29:41,167 --> 01:29:42,209
Hurry!

975
01:29:43,420 --> 01:29:44,420
Hurry!

976
01:31:23,269 --> 01:31:28,691
Luisa...you've finally come...
but I've grown so old...

977
01:31:55,176 --> 01:31:56,552
Shizuku...

978
01:31:56,720 --> 01:32:00,889
Come in...I was fast asleep.

979
01:32:02,183 --> 01:32:07,187
I'm sorry to bother you.
I've brought my story.

980
01:32:10,650 --> 01:32:13,402
It's finished?

981
01:32:15,405 --> 01:32:18,907
I promised you'd be
the first to read it.

982
01:32:19,075 --> 01:32:21,160
It's a novel!

983
01:32:21,286 --> 01:32:24,913
'Whisper of the Heart'

984
01:32:25,165 --> 01:32:29,918
Can you read it now?
I'll wait as long as it takes.

985
01:32:30,086 --> 01:32:35,424
But you've worked so hard on it...
shouldn't I take my time?

986
01:32:35,592 --> 01:32:41,055
You can stop if you don't like it.
I hate to ask, but...

987
01:32:41,765 --> 01:32:44,099
My heart's pounding...

988
01:32:44,726 --> 01:32:47,436
I see. I'll read it right now.

989
01:32:47,562 --> 01:32:50,856
Come sit by the fire. It's cold.

990
01:32:55,820 --> 01:32:58,280
Now we won't be bothered.

991
01:33:02,660 --> 01:33:05,621
Can I wait downstairs?

992
01:33:06,915 --> 01:33:09,291
It's okay. I'm not cold at all.

993
01:33:10,794 --> 01:33:14,463
Of course...but...

994
01:34:27,620 --> 01:34:29,538
You're asleep here?

995
01:34:29,706 --> 01:34:31,915
Shizuku...I'm finished.

996
01:34:34,377 --> 01:34:36,712
Thank you. It's very good.

997
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:38,547
It's not!

998
01:34:38,882 --> 01:34:42,384
Say what you really think!
I couldn't write what I wanted!

999
01:34:42,719 --> 01:34:46,096
The last half doesn't make sense.
I know that!

1000
01:34:46,264 --> 01:34:50,225
Yes...it's rough, blunt, unfinished...

1001
01:34:50,393 --> 01:34:52,561
...just like Seiji's violin.

1002
01:34:55,231 --> 01:35:00,569
You've shown me the rough stone
you've just cut out of the rock.

1003
01:35:01,237 --> 01:35:05,032
You've worked hard.
You're wonderful.

1004
01:35:06,451 --> 01:35:10,746
There's no need to rush now.
Take your time and polish it.

1005
01:35:35,605 --> 01:35:38,774
It's cold out here. Come inside.

1006
01:35:38,942 --> 01:35:39,942
Now...

1007
01:35:40,652 --> 01:35:43,612
...now I've written it I know.

1008
01:35:44,280 --> 01:35:46,448
Wanting isn't enough.

1009
01:35:46,950 --> 01:35:49,576
I have to learn more...

1010
01:35:50,787 --> 01:35:54,873
...but Seiji's getting
further and further ahead.

1011
01:35:55,291 --> 01:36:00,128
I felt that I had to force myself
to write, and I was so scared...

1012
01:36:02,590 --> 01:36:05,133
You like Seiji, don't you?

1013
01:36:26,072 --> 01:36:27,823
How is it?

1014
01:36:28,825 --> 01:36:30,117
It's very good.

1015
01:36:31,828 --> 01:36:37,082
When Seiji finished his first violin,
we had ramen noodles.

1016
01:36:37,208 --> 01:36:39,334
Jumbo size.

1017
01:36:44,299 --> 01:36:45,674
Thank you.

1018
01:36:47,677 --> 01:36:50,512
Now, where was I?

1019
01:36:50,680 --> 01:36:54,016
You found the Baron
in a coffee-shop...

1020
01:36:54,809 --> 01:36:56,018
Yes, in Germany...

1021
01:36:57,645 --> 01:37:01,857
I was a student.
He looked so melancholic...

1022
01:37:02,025 --> 01:37:05,235
I asked the owner
to sell him to me.

1023
01:37:06,362 --> 01:37:07,863
But he wouldn't.

1024
01:37:08,031 --> 01:37:13,243
The Baron had a lover, and
he wouldn't separate them.

1025
01:37:14,537 --> 01:37:19,875
He was waiting for her to come back
from being repaired...

1026
01:37:20,043 --> 01:37:22,044
...at the doll-maker's shop.

1027
01:37:22,879 --> 01:37:26,214
Just like in my story!

1028
01:37:26,716 --> 01:37:29,885
Yes...quite the coincidence!

1029
01:37:30,011 --> 01:37:34,056
I had to come home,
so I'd just about given up.

1030
01:37:34,599 --> 01:37:38,560
Then a lady friend of mine...

1031
01:37:39,228 --> 01:37:42,606
...said when the other doll came back
she would take it...

1032
01:37:42,732 --> 01:37:45,525
...and bring the two dolls together.

1033
01:37:45,651 --> 01:37:48,070
So the owner gave in.

1034
01:37:48,738 --> 01:37:52,574
I ended up leaving Germany
with just the Baron.

1035
01:37:52,700 --> 01:37:59,247
And I promised her I'd come back,
and asked her to keep the other doll.

1036
01:38:00,541 --> 01:38:03,585
The day the dolls met again...

1037
01:38:04,253 --> 01:38:07,422
...would be the day we did.

1038
01:38:09,175 --> 01:38:14,388
But then the war started,
and I couldn't keep my promise.

1039
01:38:16,265 --> 01:38:21,228
When I was finally able to go back,
I looked all over for her.

1040
01:38:22,355 --> 01:38:27,567
But there was no trace of her,
or the Baron's lover.

1041
01:38:28,861 --> 01:38:32,406
She must have been
very important to you...

1042
01:38:32,532 --> 01:38:39,413
Your story brought the Baron out of
my memory and back to life.

1043
01:38:39,539 --> 01:38:41,415
Oh, yes...

1044
01:38:49,674 --> 01:38:51,758
Hold out your hand.

1045
01:38:58,141 --> 01:38:59,141
But...

1046
01:38:59,308 --> 01:39:03,812
That stone suits you perfectly.
I'll give it to you.

1047
01:39:04,397 --> 01:39:08,108
Now, finish up your story.

1048
01:39:08,234 --> 01:39:09,317
Yes.

1049
01:39:24,750 --> 01:39:26,460
Thank you!

1050
01:39:30,423 --> 01:39:31,965
Goodbye!

1051
01:39:42,268 --> 01:39:43,310
I'm home.

1052
01:39:43,936 --> 01:39:45,145
Hi.

1053
01:39:47,857 --> 01:39:49,149
Where's Dad?

1054
01:39:49,609 --> 01:39:53,195
In the bath. Where have you been
till this hour?

1055
01:39:53,362 --> 01:39:58,992
I'm sorry I worried you. Today I return
to studying for my entrance exams.

1056
01:39:59,452 --> 01:40:02,245
So your trials are over?

1057
01:40:02,455 --> 01:40:03,830
For now.

1058
01:40:05,875 --> 01:40:08,168
Did you eat? There's curry...

1059
01:40:08,294 --> 01:40:09,336
I'm fine!

1060
01:40:11,297 --> 01:40:12,839
'For now' ...

1061
01:40:22,975 --> 01:40:25,519
Shizuku, the bath's open.

1062
01:40:45,206 --> 01:40:47,207
Ah, a soldier at ease.

1063
01:41:54,150 --> 01:41:55,191
No!

1064
01:42:03,075 --> 01:42:04,784
Wait there!

1065
01:42:20,009 --> 01:42:22,135
It's a miracle! You're here!

1066
01:42:22,261 --> 01:42:23,803
We're not dreaming?

1067
01:42:24,055 --> 01:42:27,140
I got an earlier plane. Hop on.

1068
01:42:27,725 --> 01:42:30,977
Wait...you'll be cold.

1069
01:42:33,606 --> 01:42:34,814
Climb on.

1070
01:42:36,025 --> 01:42:37,275
I'll get a coat.

1071
01:42:37,401 --> 01:42:39,653
No time! Get on.

1072
01:42:41,947 --> 01:42:43,490
Hang on tight.

1073
01:42:49,038 --> 01:42:52,916
I was out there calling you
in my head.

1074
01:42:53,042 --> 01:42:54,501
'Shizuku!'

1075
01:42:54,752 --> 01:42:57,837
And then you appeared!

1076
01:42:58,381 --> 01:42:59,756
What a team!

1077
01:43:01,050 --> 01:43:04,719
Me, too...it's like I'm still dreaming!

1078
01:43:10,559 --> 01:43:12,352
How was Cremona?

1079
01:43:12,478 --> 01:43:16,022
A lot different than I thought.
But I'm going to do it.

1080
01:43:16,857 --> 01:43:18,400
It's getting light!

1081
01:43:27,410 --> 01:43:28,535
Shall I get off?

1082
01:43:28,661 --> 01:43:29,703
It's alright.

1083
01:43:30,746 --> 01:43:35,875
I made up my mind I was going to
ride you up this hill!

1084
01:43:36,001 --> 01:43:37,711
That's not fair!

1085
01:43:40,464 --> 01:43:42,882
I'm no man's burden!

1086
01:43:46,011 --> 01:43:49,389
I want to be of use!

1087
01:43:50,516 --> 01:43:52,600
Okay! Push!

1088
01:43:53,436 --> 01:43:54,728
Almost there!

1089
01:44:08,993 --> 01:44:12,120
Shizuku! Jump on!

1090
01:44:30,222 --> 01:44:31,431
We made it!

1091
01:44:36,395 --> 01:44:38,438
- I'll hold the coat.
- I'm fine.

1092
01:44:41,901 --> 01:44:42,942
Here...

1093
01:45:00,085 --> 01:45:03,797
Wow! In the mist it looks
just like the sea!

1094
01:45:03,923 --> 01:45:07,884
This is my secret place.
It's almost time.

1095
01:45:52,638 --> 01:45:55,014
I wanted you to see this.

1096
01:45:58,310 --> 01:46:01,187
Grandpa told me everything.

1097
01:46:01,313 --> 01:46:05,859
I didn't do anything to help...
I was just thinking of myself.

1098
01:46:05,985 --> 01:46:09,195
No...you were the reason I did it.

1099
01:46:09,989 --> 01:46:14,868
I'm glad I pushed myself.
I understand myself better now.

1100
01:46:15,452 --> 01:46:20,456
I'm going to study hard
and go on to high school.

1101
01:46:20,583 --> 01:46:23,209
Listen, Shizuku...

1102
01:46:24,420 --> 01:46:28,047
...I can't say how soon it'll be, but...

1103
01:46:28,757 --> 01:46:30,967
...would you marry me?

1104
01:46:32,052 --> 01:46:36,598
I'm going to be a violin maker...
and then...

1105
01:46:41,770 --> 01:46:42,812
You mean it?

1106
01:46:42,938 --> 01:46:46,232
That's exactly what I wanted.

1107
01:46:46,442 --> 01:46:48,484
Yeah? Great!

1108
01:46:48,861 --> 01:46:52,113
Wait...it's cold...

1109
01:46:52,781 --> 01:46:55,408
Shizuku...I love you!
