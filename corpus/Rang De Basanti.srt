1
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:11,641
If yet your blood does not rage..

2
00:01:12,141 --> 00:01:14,683
..then it is water that flows in your veins.

3
00:01:15,183 --> 00:01:17,016
For what is the flush of youth..

4
00:01:17,516 --> 00:01:21,016
..if it is not of service to the motherland.

5
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:00,350
Just a minute Mr. McKinley, one
revolutionary is meeting another.

6
00:02:07,725 --> 00:02:09,766
Thank you. Shall we go?

7
00:02:10,266 --> 00:02:15,766
I'm sorry it had to end this way.

8
00:02:16,266 --> 00:02:20,558
This isn't the end Mr. McKinley.
This is just the beginning.

9
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:24,558
There will be others after we have gone.
Many others.

10
00:02:35,516 --> 00:02:38,891
I always believed that there were
two kinds of men in this world.

11
00:02:39,391 --> 00:02:42,725
Men who go to their death screaming and men..

12
00:02:43,225 --> 00:02:48,225
..who go to their death in silence.

13
00:02:48,725 --> 00:02:52,225
And then I met the third kind.

14
00:02:58,516 --> 00:03:01,641
Sometimes in my dreams I can
still see them making their..

15
00:03:02,141 --> 00:03:05,600
..long last walk.

16
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,740
They never so much as broke their stride.

17
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:11,475
They never faltered.

18
00:03:11,975 --> 00:03:15,850
But above all others I remembered his eyes.

19
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:22,391
How they looked at me. Clear, defiant..

20
00:03:22,891 --> 00:03:26,391
..never wavering.

21
00:04:01,933 --> 00:04:05,433
It's time..

22
00:05:53,516 --> 00:05:55,100
Hi.. - Hi..

23
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,100
Good morning..

24
00:06:02,266 --> 00:06:06,100
Good morning. - Good morning.

25
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,891
So, Sonia, my contact in Delhi,
has gathered some information..

26
00:06:11,391 --> 00:06:14,016
..and we have to wire her some money to secure it.

27
00:06:14,516 --> 00:06:18,016
Everything is cash up there.

28
00:06:20,933 --> 00:06:23,600
Have I come to the wrong meeting?

29
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:27,350
We had directive from above, by Jacobs.

30
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:31,141
We had to make some very tough decisions.

31
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:35,183
Sorry Sue, I am really sorry.

32
00:06:35,683 --> 00:06:37,883
If you do an episode on Gandhi
that would work for us..

33
00:06:38,308 --> 00:06:41,558
You know Gandhi sells, I suggest
some fairy tales or even Robin Hood.

34
00:06:42,058 --> 00:06:48,475
But these revolutionaries, Bhagat
Singh, Chandrashekhar Ali..

35
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:51,808
It's Azad, Chandrashekhar
Azad and Azad means freedom.

36
00:06:52,308 --> 00:06:53,908
Azad sorry and I know what it means Sue.

37
00:06:53,941 --> 00:06:55,699
I don't believe this, everything has been set up..

38
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,640
..and I have been working on
this for the past two years.

39
00:06:57,641 --> 00:07:01,183
I have been going to Hindi night classes.

40
00:07:01,683 --> 00:07:05,641
Look..- Please, their story deserves to be told.

41
00:07:06,141 --> 00:07:09,141
This is my grandfather's diary.
He was an eye witness.

42
00:07:09,641 --> 00:07:11,558
This is filled with real conversations.

43
00:07:12,058 --> 00:07:15,725
Their very words. Boys not older
than 23 fighting the empire.

44
00:07:16,225 --> 00:07:19,725
That's an important story. A bloody important..

45
00:07:51,725 --> 00:07:56,558
This is not the end Miss McKinley.

46
00:07:57,058 --> 00:07:59,933
Sue.. Sue.

47
00:08:00,433 --> 00:08:02,225
Can I talk to you?

48
00:08:02,725 --> 00:08:06,641
Where are you going?
- To India, to shoot a documentary.

49
00:08:07,141 --> 00:08:12,100
I'll send you a postcard. - How? With what?

50
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:16,100
Your Mother's eye.

51
00:08:48,225 --> 00:08:50,308
Are you talking or hijacking her?

52
00:08:50,808 --> 00:08:51,848
Get out of the way! Scoot!

53
00:08:52,183 --> 00:08:54,808
First time in India, madam? Don't worry.
- Yes! No..

54
00:08:55,308 --> 00:08:57,641
Are you married? Even I and my wife are married.

55
00:08:58,141 --> 00:09:00,933
Sue, you don't have to worry he is with me.

56
00:09:01,433 --> 00:09:03,641
Yeah, I am with her.. With me.

57
00:09:04,141 --> 00:09:05,261
Oh, it's so good to see you.

58
00:09:05,425 --> 00:09:08,057
I can't believe it you are here.
That it's happening at last.

59
00:09:08,058 --> 00:09:11,100
Sorry about the short notice.

60
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,516
Mind-blowing! Your Hindi has really improved.
- Thank you.

61
00:09:16,016 --> 00:09:19,516
Don't worry, all the preparations are done.

62
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:35,433
Hey Sue, no need to worry..

63
00:09:35,933 --> 00:09:37,558
All the preparations are done.

64
00:09:38,058 --> 00:09:39,600
..posters have been put up everywhere.

65
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,683
It's also been announced on radio.

66
00:09:42,183 --> 00:09:46,808
Just see, they'll be lining up for the auditions.

67
00:09:47,308 --> 00:09:49,725
What's wrong?

68
00:09:50,225 --> 00:09:57,516
I didn't tell you. The truth
is that I've come alone.

69
00:09:58,016 --> 00:10:01,516
..no money, no producer is going to arrive.

70
00:10:02,016 --> 00:10:05,391
I know. - You knew it!

71
00:10:05,891 --> 00:10:10,683
After Alice, there was a call from Beth Williams..

72
00:10:11,183 --> 00:10:13,183
..she informed me of the
cancellation of the show..

73
00:10:13,225 --> 00:10:17,058
..and also my services.

74
00:10:17,558 --> 00:10:23,516
By the way, did you abuse her in Hindi?

75
00:10:24,016 --> 00:10:25,725
She wanted to know what it meant.

76
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:29,725
I explained to her in graphic detail.

77
00:10:34,475 --> 00:10:37,975
You are amazing.. Sonia.

78
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:50,850
What's that? - That's the Red Fort.

79
00:10:58,725 --> 00:11:04,266
This is Delhi University. Let
me help you with your luggage.

80
00:11:04,766 --> 00:11:08,600
How much? - Ma'am I've already told you.

81
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,808
No, no.. - I can help.

82
00:11:11,308 --> 00:11:12,682
Thanks Ravi, you are a sweetheart.

83
00:11:12,683 --> 00:11:14,803
Ravi, please get all the luggage to our room.
- Fine.

84
00:11:14,933 --> 00:11:18,433
Thank you.

85
00:11:20,641 --> 00:11:24,141
Hello which country, madam? - India, I hope.

86
00:11:33,766 --> 00:11:37,266
Your room. - Okay.

87
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,225
Get some rest now. I'll see you tomorrow..

88
00:11:42,725 --> 00:11:44,808
..If you need anything you have my number.

89
00:11:45,308 --> 00:11:47,516
Thanks. - Okay.

90
00:11:48,016 --> 00:11:52,183
Let's go Ravi.

91
00:11:52,683 --> 00:11:54,766
My Grandpa was right..

92
00:11:55,266 --> 00:11:58,766
..he said when you come to
India, it's love at first sight.

93
00:12:28,266 --> 00:12:30,433
Hi this is Dabbo speaking. And my hobbies..

94
00:12:30,933 --> 00:12:34,433
..are bikes, babes and body building.

95
00:12:38,391 --> 00:12:42,850
"Little child what do you
behold in your infant hands.."

96
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:49,225
"Little child what do you
behold in your infant hands.."

97
00:12:49,725 --> 00:12:52,516
Oh no!

98
00:12:53,016 --> 00:12:54,975
I can't do this.

99
00:12:55,475 --> 00:12:58,475
Listen.. - Just try once.

100
00:12:58,975 --> 00:13:02,516
I can't do this.

101
00:13:03,016 --> 00:13:10,975
I deserve a role because I have
dimples just like Priety Zinta.

102
00:13:11,475 --> 00:13:14,933
"When flowers in the garden bloom.."

103
00:13:15,433 --> 00:13:18,933
"Jana, Gana, Mana, Vande Matram.."

104
00:13:41,058 --> 00:13:44,141
Because women can make possible impossible..

105
00:13:44,641 --> 00:13:45,808
..impossible possible.

106
00:13:46,308 --> 00:13:47,308
I love you.

107
00:13:47,558 --> 00:13:48,850
Hi, how's that?

108
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:50,790
"When flowers in the garden bloom.."

109
00:13:51,266 --> 00:13:54,641
Don't sing. Just recite "Vande Matram".
- Vande Matram?

110
00:13:55,141 --> 00:13:58,641
"Vande Matram Jana, Gana, Mana.."
"Vande Matram Jana, Gana, Mana.."

111
00:14:06,433 --> 00:14:08,725
Rascal, if you have the guts then come out.

112
00:14:09,225 --> 00:14:11,016
Everyone calls me Bhai..

113
00:14:11,516 --> 00:14:13,808
Raise your hand and say Vande Matram!
- Vande Matram!

114
00:14:14,308 --> 00:14:16,683
Speak loudly, Vande Matram! - Vande Matram.

115
00:14:17,183 --> 00:14:20,308
Loudly and proudly, Vande Matram! - Vande Matram

116
00:14:20,808 --> 00:14:22,641
Vande Matram! - Vande Matram..

117
00:14:23,141 --> 00:14:24,433
I know about the fight.

118
00:14:24,933 --> 00:14:27,266
I have dedicated my life to
the freedom of this nation.

119
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:29,966
I have dedicated my life to
the freedom of this nation.

120
00:14:30,183 --> 00:14:32,350
I know you want me to get married.

121
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:35,891
..but Freedom is my bride.

122
00:14:36,391 --> 00:14:39,891
I know.. I know.. that..

123
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:46,891
I know.. that you want me to get married..

124
00:14:47,391 --> 00:14:49,100
..but my bride is Freedom

125
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,641
..but my bride is Freedom.

126
00:14:53,141 --> 00:14:55,891
Your obedient son, Bhagat Singh.

127
00:14:56,391 --> 00:14:57,391
Bhagat Singh.

128
00:14:57,766 --> 00:14:58,766
Bhagat Singh. - Anyone.

129
00:14:59,225 --> 00:15:00,225
Bhagat Singh.

130
00:15:00,641 --> 00:15:02,100
My turn. - My turn.

131
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:06,100
My name is Bhagat Singh. Inquilab Zindabad.

132
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:16,100
Tea! - Thanks.

133
00:15:19,808 --> 00:15:21,850
Depressed huh?

134
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:25,600
One or two of them can be used for minor roles..

135
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:29,766
..but no one's even close
for Azad or Bhagat Singh.

136
00:15:30,266 --> 00:15:33,141
I guess it's all my fault.

137
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:39,641
No Sonia. You're my rock. It's my fault.
I should have never come.

138
00:15:40,141 --> 00:15:43,058
Sue, don't get so dejected.

139
00:15:43,558 --> 00:15:44,891
I think we need a break.

140
00:15:45,391 --> 00:15:47,516
Let's go and have some fun.
- I'm in no mood Sonia.

141
00:15:48,016 --> 00:15:50,391
We are going to the classroom. - Classroom.

142
00:15:50,891 --> 00:15:54,391
Lose control.

143
00:15:57,391 --> 00:16:03,475
Lose control.

144
00:16:03,975 --> 00:16:06,600
One more chance, Lose.. lose..

145
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:10,600
Lose control.

146
00:16:13,266 --> 00:16:14,891
C'mon..

147
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:16,891
Lose control.

148
00:16:17,391 --> 00:16:21,016
Mr. Poet.. - Hey Sonia.

149
00:16:21,516 --> 00:16:24,933
What's happening?

150
00:16:25,433 --> 00:16:29,350
How are you? - Fine. How are you?

151
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:31,766
Aslam.. Sue McKinley. - Hi.

152
00:16:32,266 --> 00:16:33,546
You too study at the University?

153
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:35,641
Wow! Her Hindi is great.

154
00:16:36,141 --> 00:16:37,183
We live there, eat there..

155
00:16:37,683 --> 00:16:41,141
..but no one has ever accused
us of studying there.

156
00:16:41,641 --> 00:16:46,600
What do you say Sonia? - Come.

157
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,308
DJ! DJ! DJ!..

158
00:16:49,808 --> 00:16:56,266

DJ! DJ! DJ!..

161
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,141
Who are those maniacs?

162
00:17:11,641 --> 00:17:12,641
That's DJ..

163
00:17:13,016 --> 00:17:15,641
DJ I love you!!!

164
00:17:16,141 --> 00:17:20,475
That's Sukhi.

165
00:17:20,975 --> 00:17:26,141
Let's rock it!

166
00:17:26,641 --> 00:17:28,641
DJ I love you!!!

167
00:17:29,141 --> 00:17:33,391
I love you too baby!

168
00:17:33,891 --> 00:17:34,891
Hey, bring it. .

169
00:17:35,391 --> 00:17:37,350
DJ! DJ! DJ!..

170
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:39,891
- What are you doing?

171
00:17:40,391 --> 00:17:44,808
DJ! DJ! DJ!..

172
00:17:45,308 --> 00:17:48,058
Damn exhibitionists.

173
00:17:48,558 --> 00:17:50,975
They'll never change.

174
00:17:51,475 --> 00:17:58,641
Come on dude, let's rock it! - Let's do it.

175
00:17:59,141 --> 00:18:01,475
Come on, Sukhi. Show everyone.

176
00:18:01,975 --> 00:18:05,475
DJ! DJ! DJ!..

177
00:18:11,808 --> 00:18:15,308
Is he OK?

178
00:18:26,808 --> 00:18:27,808
Is he OK?

179
00:18:28,141 --> 00:18:29,641
That's his natural pose.

180
00:18:30,141 --> 00:18:33,350
Hey, pal. - DJ.

181
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:37,600
Sukhi, all parts working? - DJ!

182
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:43,641
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Who is this?

183
00:18:44,141 --> 00:18:48,058
Sue this is DJ. DJ this is Sue. - Hi!

184
00:18:48,558 --> 00:18:52,350
Sue? She's so pink her name
should be Gulabo (Rose). - DJ.

185
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:55,516
She's quite hot..

186
00:18:56,016 --> 00:19:01,016
I mean it's very cold.

187
00:19:01,516 --> 00:19:08,933
Karan you saved my life. I love you!
- Love you too, Sukhi.

188
00:19:09,433 --> 00:19:10,516
Aslam..

189
00:19:11,016 --> 00:19:13,058
..you too saved my life,

190
00:19:13,558 --> 00:19:14,850
I love you too!

191
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:18,850
It's ok.

192
00:19:20,891 --> 00:19:22,475
She must have saved my life too..

193
00:19:22,975 --> 00:19:24,891
No! Sukhi! She didn't save your life.

194
00:19:25,391 --> 00:19:27,975
No problem. One day she'll save my life.

195
00:19:28,475 --> 00:19:36,475
Coming.. - Hey brother, take a
hike. She is your sister-in-law.

196
00:19:37,641 --> 00:19:41,141
"One more time.." "Lose Control.."

197
00:19:49,058 --> 00:19:53,850
"Lose Control."

198
00:19:54,350 --> 00:20:00,766
"I'm a Rebel.."

199
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:08,183
"I am a rebel."

200
00:20:08,683 --> 00:20:14,683
"There's aren't any students
here, no teachers to suffer.."

201
00:20:15,183 --> 00:20:20,850
"There's aren't any students
here, no teachers to suffer.."

202
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:24,141
"Our school is a school filled with fun."

203
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:28,141
"Our school is a school filled with fun."

204
00:20:34,808 --> 00:20:38,891
"Lose Control.."

205
00:20:39,391 --> 00:20:42,683
Sukhi you just sit and watch like a dumb-ass..

206
00:20:43,183 --> 00:20:44,223
DJ doesn't waste a second.

207
00:20:44,516 --> 00:20:45,516
He's a stud.

208
00:20:45,975 --> 00:20:49,141
Hi! How's everybody? Hi Rahul! What's up?

209
00:20:49,641 --> 00:20:50,891
Got a few gigs lined up.

210
00:20:51,391 --> 00:20:52,558
How's your radio thing going?

211
00:20:53,058 --> 00:20:54,658
Its not Radio thing, it is Radio Jockey.

212
00:20:55,141 --> 00:20:56,141
Did anything work out?

213
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:58,391
All India Radio has given me a night slot.

214
00:20:58,891 --> 00:21:00,350
Means your scene is shaping up!

215
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:05,100
Not really. When the whole
world's sleeping I'm on air.

216
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,600
But people stay up late..

217
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:12,141
Criminals, insomniacs, watchmen and idiots!

218
00:21:12,641 --> 00:21:13,761
Have your fun at my expense.

219
00:21:14,141 --> 00:21:16,641
Speaking of expenses.. Can I..

220
00:21:17,141 --> 00:21:20,641
Trial Job, No income.

221
00:21:25,141 --> 00:21:26,891
Thanks man, thanks a lot.

222
00:21:27,391 --> 00:21:31,058
See you guys. Got a cigarette?

223
00:21:31,558 --> 00:21:35,308
Okay, see you. Take care, thanks.

224
00:21:35,808 --> 00:21:37,683
Fabulous! - Leave it.

225
00:21:38,183 --> 00:21:41,683
It's my Dad's money. He's got loads of it..

226
00:21:50,141 --> 00:21:52,183
Stop this Western music, this obscenity!

227
00:21:52,683 --> 00:21:55,475
How many times do I have to
make you understand this!

228
00:21:55,975 --> 00:21:58,266
Polluting the culture of this country..

229
00:21:58,766 --> 00:22:01,141
Leave this place right now. Leave!

230
00:22:01,641 --> 00:22:06,183
Can't you understand, bastard!

231
00:22:06,683 --> 00:22:09,850
This is your last warning..

232
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:13,516
..from now on, nobody plays
any Western music out here.

233
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:17,350
No lewd dancing!

234
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:23,266
It is better you listen or I'll break your legs.

235
00:22:23,766 --> 00:22:26,475
Who are you to warn us? If you
don't like it, don't come here.

236
00:22:26,975 --> 00:22:30,475
You bloody Pakistani!

237
00:22:35,016 --> 00:22:38,516
Let's finish it.

238
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:51,850
Hey, empty this place.

239
00:22:55,766 --> 00:22:59,266
Last warning! Got it?

240
00:23:03,808 --> 00:23:06,266
Long live India!

241
00:23:06,766 --> 00:23:10,850
Get up. Empty this place or we will arrest you.

242
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:13,600
You touch Aslam and see what I do to you..

243
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:18,183
..even your mother won't recognize you.

244
00:23:18,683 --> 00:23:19,766
Ever seen a baboons arse?

245
00:23:20,266 --> 00:23:22,641
Yours will be as red after I've finished with you.

246
00:23:23,141 --> 00:23:27,891
Sir, I'm sure we can work it out.
Come here. No matter..

247
00:23:28,391 --> 00:23:33,516
You think too much of yourself don't you?

248
00:23:34,016 --> 00:23:38,225
Keep this..

249
00:23:38,725 --> 00:23:40,558
Was that a bribe?

250
00:23:41,058 --> 00:23:42,475
Welcome to India Sue!

251
00:23:42,975 --> 00:23:50,141
Anyone hungry? I'm famished.

252
00:23:50,641 --> 00:23:52,141
Hey Sue, want a ride?

253
00:23:52,641 --> 00:23:56,141
You've got insurance?

254
00:25:08,141 --> 00:25:11,641
Karan..

255
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:23,600
Love you..

256
00:25:40,225 --> 00:25:41,266
Shit!

257
00:25:41,766 --> 00:25:43,016
Almost, almost..

258
00:25:43,516 --> 00:25:46,933
You..!

259
00:25:47,433 --> 00:25:49,350
How're you?

260
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:55,433
Hey honey! Come here you..

261
00:25:55,933 --> 00:25:58,183
If something happened to you, I'd have killed you.

262
00:25:58,683 --> 00:26:03,266
Is this any way to greet your boyfriend?

263
00:26:03,766 --> 00:26:04,766
How're you?

264
00:26:04,975 --> 00:26:07,433
Hey, how are you? - I am fine, how are you?

265
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:10,141
Mr. Rathod.. - Aslam, you keep growing tall.

266
00:26:10,641 --> 00:26:14,266
Stop acting..

267
00:26:14,766 --> 00:26:16,600
Sexy jacket, bro. - It is.

268
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,100
Hi, Ajay.. - Hi.

269
00:26:18,391 --> 00:26:20,191
Flight lieutenant Ajay Rathod. - She's right.

270
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,600
Hurry guys, I'm famished.

271
00:26:21,891 --> 00:26:23,011
You won't get any food here.

272
00:26:23,391 --> 00:26:26,308
Hey Mitro, my mother, how are you?
- Your Mitro is dead.

273
00:26:26,808 --> 00:26:29,599
Stay away! You remembered your
mother after two months..

274
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,432
..I carried you in my stomach for nine months..

275
00:26:31,433 --> 00:26:32,753
..and washed your bum for years..

276
00:26:32,891 --> 00:26:35,808
..and you come here as being a gentleman.

277
00:26:36,308 --> 00:26:37,308
Get lost!

278
00:26:37,516 --> 00:26:40,558
Does anyone bother to check
if Mitro is alive or dead?

279
00:26:41,058 --> 00:26:42,100
What's up?

280
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,600
You're drunk again.

281
00:26:44,058 --> 00:26:46,516
No. No. No.
- One is in military and other keeps enjoying.

282
00:26:47,016 --> 00:26:50,391
First give us food ma, and
then yell at us all night.

283
00:26:50,891 --> 00:26:53,291
None of you have eaten? What
will happen to this generation?

284
00:26:53,391 --> 00:26:57,558
Sonia you've lost even more weight.
- Really.. Mitro

285
00:26:58,058 --> 00:27:01,641
The girls of today have
more bones and less flesh..

286
00:27:02,141 --> 00:27:03,433
How will you bear children?

287
00:27:03,933 --> 00:27:06,350
How will you bear children?

288
00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:11,016
Aslam, how are you my son? I didn't notice you.

289
00:27:11,516 --> 00:27:13,808
He is my true son who bothers to check on me.

290
00:27:14,308 --> 00:27:19,183
And he is one.. I committed a
mistake by sending you to city.

291
00:27:19,683 --> 00:27:22,558
Look ma, what I brought for you.

292
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:27,391
Your daughter-in-law. Her name is Sue.

293
00:27:27,891 --> 00:27:29,350
What? A foreigner?

294
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:31,558
Brought her especially from London.

295
00:27:32,058 --> 00:27:33,850
That's why I was away for so long.

296
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:36,975
I told her that's it's your first trip to India.

297
00:27:37,475 --> 00:27:39,850
Give me your blessings Ma.

298
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:42,641
Your son's such a brat.

299
00:27:43,141 --> 00:27:50,141
God! She understands Hindi!

300
00:27:50,641 --> 00:27:54,641
She understands everything.

301
00:27:55,141 --> 00:27:57,641
You really understand everything? - Yes.

302
00:27:58,141 --> 00:27:59,141
What a problem!

303
00:27:59,433 --> 00:28:03,350
I'm going off to sleep. Your beds are all ready.

304
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:07,391
No need to drive so late at night.

305
00:28:07,891 --> 00:28:09,975
I saw them then..

306
00:28:10,475 --> 00:28:13,975
..like they leapt out of the
pages of grandpa's dairy.

307
00:28:34,475 --> 00:28:37,391
Bhagat Singh, Chandrashekhar Azad, Rajguru ..

308
00:28:37,891 --> 00:28:40,891
..and Durga Bhabhi, Asfaqulla Khan

309
00:28:41,391 --> 00:28:45,016
And they were sitting right in front of me.

310
00:28:45,516 --> 00:28:48,183
Sue, where are you?

311
00:28:48,683 --> 00:28:50,391
Will you guys act in my film?

312
00:28:50,891 --> 00:28:51,891
What?

313
00:28:52,141 --> 00:28:55,641
Will you guys act in my film? You all are perfect.

314
00:28:56,141 --> 00:29:00,516
Hey, why are you guys laughing?
I'm the hero of her film.

315
00:29:01,016 --> 00:29:03,558
Yeah we guys are champions
when it comes to acting..

316
00:29:04,058 --> 00:29:05,766
..clowning around is all they do.

317
00:29:06,266 --> 00:29:07,350
I am serious okay.

318
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:10,683
The four of you will be perfect
for the roles of Bhagat Singh..

319
00:29:11,183 --> 00:29:13,558
..Chandrashekar Azad, Ashfaqulla Khan, Rajguru.

320
00:29:14,058 --> 00:29:15,600
And Sonia will be my Durga Bhabhi.

321
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:18,100
She really knows Hindi!

322
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:21,391
All this talk of patriotism is boring.

323
00:29:21,891 --> 00:29:25,891
Boring? These guys gave their lives
for the freedom of your country.

324
00:29:26,391 --> 00:29:28,600
What freedom? Have you seen
the state of this country?

325
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,133
No one believes this rubbish thing.

326
00:29:30,433 --> 00:29:34,516
Excuse me! I believe in this country, Karan.

327
00:29:35,016 --> 00:29:37,336
Otherwise, why would I be fighting for it?
- I don't know.

328
00:29:37,433 --> 00:29:41,183
Maybe because it's cool! Being a pilot..
Flying an expensive plane.

329
00:29:41,683 --> 00:29:42,923
You get to wear fancy jackets..

330
00:29:43,016 --> 00:29:46,725
And the women.. women love men in uniforms.

331
00:29:47,225 --> 00:29:49,516
Sure I love being a pilot. Sure it's cool.

332
00:29:50,016 --> 00:29:53,850
But I also feel proud of my country,
and I can give my life for it.

333
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:57,058
Proud of what?

334
00:29:57,158 --> 00:29:58,765
..this country's exploding population?

335
00:29:58,766 --> 00:30:00,891
..or unemployment.. - or corruption?

336
00:30:01,391 --> 00:30:02,951
Which of these are you really proud of?

337
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:04,100
Come on guys..

338
00:30:04,391 --> 00:30:07,141
..no country's perfect Karan.
We've got to make it better.

339
00:30:07,641 --> 00:30:08,641
Right.

340
00:30:09,058 --> 00:30:11,850
Ok, Ajay you make this country perfect.

341
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:16,141
The minute I get my degree I'm out of this dump..

342
00:30:16,641 --> 00:30:19,350
You won't be able to leave us and go.
- Wait and see.

343
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:24,016
She speaks Hindi so well!

344
00:30:24,516 --> 00:30:27,225
Why didn't you tell me you son of a bitch..

345
00:30:27,725 --> 00:30:31,225
..I was making a fool of myself.

346
00:30:36,016 --> 00:30:38,891
At least ask them once, please.

347
00:30:39,391 --> 00:30:41,683
So you won't give up.

348
00:30:42,183 --> 00:30:45,891
Ok. But nobody will turn up.

349
00:30:46,391 --> 00:30:49,891
They will come. I'll get them. That's a promise.

350
00:30:57,225 --> 00:31:01,766
Karan put your cigarette out.

351
00:31:02,266 --> 00:31:03,558
Greetings grandpa!

352
00:31:04,058 --> 00:31:06,891
God bless you. When did you come?

353
00:31:07,391 --> 00:31:14,141
Just last night. Some friends.

354
00:31:14,641 --> 00:31:18,141
Who is he? - DJ's grandfather.

355
00:31:23,516 --> 00:31:29,725
Bye. - Bye Mitro.

356
00:31:30,225 --> 00:31:33,725
You...

357
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:59,933
Good morning Karan. Back so early?

358
00:32:00,433 --> 00:32:03,225
I didn't know you were in town.

359
00:32:03,725 --> 00:32:05,516
Just arrived an hour ago.

360
00:32:06,016 --> 00:32:08,475
It was a long flight.

361
00:32:08,975 --> 00:32:11,766
Everything Ok at college? - Everything's fine Dad.

362
00:32:12,266 --> 00:32:14,026
Have you decided which American university..

363
00:32:14,183 --> 00:32:16,766
..you want to go to next year?

364
00:32:17,266 --> 00:32:20,141
Michigan university, it's a famous
university.. then there's..

365
00:32:20,641 --> 00:32:22,350
Carnegie Mellon, Wharton..

366
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:26,350
I know the list.

367
00:32:28,808 --> 00:32:32,141
Hello.. Karan wait!

368
00:32:32,641 --> 00:32:38,433
I can't hear you clearly call me later.
I told you to call later.

369
00:32:38,933 --> 00:32:42,350
I know that you know about the lists.

370
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:45,141
But life doesn't just happen to you.

371
00:32:45,641 --> 00:32:47,766
You've got to plan it..

372
00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:52,891
Every second someone is born
in this country's drainage.

373
00:32:53,391 --> 00:32:56,350
Nobody cares about them. Neither
the government nor God.

374
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:59,016
I don't want.

375
00:32:59,516 --> 00:33:02,266
Do something. Or else you will be one of them.

376
00:33:02,766 --> 00:33:05,350
Please, don't start with your lectures.

377
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:09,558
SMS generation. Any
conversation that goes beyond..

378
00:33:10,058 --> 00:33:12,600
..four lines becomes a lecture.

379
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,600
Hello..

380
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:21,058
Signal's weak here give me a second.
I will just go out and talk.

381
00:33:21,558 --> 00:33:26,891
Yes, tell me. The deal is off
then, we are not interested..

382
00:33:27,391 --> 00:33:29,058
You are wasting my time.

383
00:33:29,558 --> 00:33:31,475
You know Russian quality is doubtful..

384
00:33:31,975 --> 00:33:33,375
..they can't afford to be arrogant.

385
00:33:33,433 --> 00:33:35,100
It is a profitable deal.

386
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:39,558
Anyway in the open market
they'd not get half of it.

387
00:33:40,058 --> 00:33:45,183
And you know how many fathers there..

388
00:33:45,683 --> 00:33:51,558
..are to every deal in India.

389
00:33:52,058 --> 00:33:53,391
Nothing.

390
00:33:53,891 --> 00:33:57,391
Tell them we won't bargain, they
should wire the money to us.

391
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:23,100
I did try to warn you.. they won't turn up.

392
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,808
DJ promised me.

393
00:34:25,308 --> 00:34:26,850
Oh! DJ promised you!

394
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:28,600
So you really are a filmmaker?

395
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:33,308
Karan.. Why are you so late?

396
00:34:33,808 --> 00:34:37,475
And where are the others?

397
00:34:37,975 --> 00:34:44,600
The Young Guns Of India. Very dramatic.

398
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:47,558
Where are you going?

399
00:34:48,058 --> 00:34:50,600
Well that's one part cast.

400
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:54,600
I am sure Karan can tell us where his friends are.

401
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:09,016
How are you? I am fine. I am preparing omelets.

402
00:35:09,516 --> 00:35:11,766
She's an eight. Yeah! Wow! Nine.

403
00:35:12,266 --> 00:35:15,433
What a girl! Oye Chotu get me a cup of tea..

404
00:35:15,933 --> 00:35:20,641
Two, tell her to go..

405
00:35:21,141 --> 00:35:22,141
Six..

406
00:35:22,516 --> 00:35:27,600
Ten! What? - Ten from far and enough from close,

407
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:32,100
Dude.. looks at those legs!

408
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:35,433
Shake it baby, shake it..

409
00:35:35,933 --> 00:35:36,933
Oh shit!

410
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:38,990
Don't be silly, that's at least an eight.

411
00:35:39,016 --> 00:35:41,725
Thought I'd find you stuffing your faces.

412
00:35:42,225 --> 00:35:44,558
You lazy good for nothings.

413
00:35:45,058 --> 00:35:46,933
We were about to come.. but..

414
00:35:47,433 --> 00:35:48,933
..we are waiting for Karan actually.

415
00:35:49,433 --> 00:35:51,100
Oh! So you were waiting for Karan. - Yes.

416
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:54,475
Karan was there on time. ..Yeah!

417
00:35:54,975 --> 00:35:57,558
We are waiting for him here and
he was waiting for us there.

418
00:35:58,058 --> 00:36:02,058
We were supposed to meet here. - What confusion..

419
00:36:02,558 --> 00:36:04,350
You're Ashfaqulla Khan.

420
00:36:04,850 --> 00:36:06,641
You're Rajguru. - The hero right!

421
00:36:07,141 --> 00:36:08,350
And you know who you are?

422
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:11,058
The Master of Disguise and Deception.

423
00:36:11,558 --> 00:36:13,391
Chandrashekhar Azad.

424
00:36:13,891 --> 00:36:15,183
I will die on you.

425
00:36:15,683 --> 00:36:18,391
Learn the lines properly, we meet tomorrow.

426
00:36:18,891 --> 00:36:21,225
The practice will be tomorrow at 8 a.m. sharp!

427
00:36:21,725 --> 00:36:23,766
Nine. - Sharp at eight.

428
00:36:24,266 --> 00:36:27,766
That's fine. - We've already wasted a day..

429
00:36:32,808 --> 00:36:35,766
Aslam, your sister-in-law looks
even better when she's angry.

430
00:36:36,266 --> 00:36:44,266
I have fallen in love.

431
00:36:47,391 --> 00:36:50,891
What are you doing Laxman?

432
00:36:53,266 --> 00:36:56,100
Party High Command is really happy with your work.

433
00:36:56,600 --> 00:37:00,808
These demonstrations that you have
started against Western culture..

434
00:37:01,308 --> 00:37:05,766
..they've helped us overshadow other parties.

435
00:37:06,266 --> 00:37:08,766
Come. Come.

436
00:37:09,266 --> 00:37:14,725
Give me. - Take this.

437
00:37:15,225 --> 00:37:18,183
This is for you. And this is for your boys.

438
00:37:18,683 --> 00:37:20,433
It's not necessary, Mishraji.

439
00:37:20,933 --> 00:37:22,850
I'm not doing this for money.

440
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:26,391
I really believe in the principles of my party.

441
00:37:26,891 --> 00:37:28,433
That's fine Laxman..

442
00:37:28,933 --> 00:37:35,266
..but every movement needs fuel.. Keep it.

443
00:37:35,766 --> 00:37:41,433
Come, how is your work going on?

444
00:37:41,933 --> 00:37:45,100
March the 14th we started our rehearsals.

445
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:49,100
To say I was nervous, would be an understatement.

446
00:37:57,100 --> 00:38:01,433
"There is nothing you can do to break me."

447
00:38:01,933 --> 00:38:04,641
"Because I have made pain my friend."

448
00:38:05,141 --> 00:38:08,641
"..As I hold Death's fingers."

449
00:38:21,266 --> 00:38:23,975
DJ idiot, don't spoil my concentration.

450
00:38:24,475 --> 00:38:28,058
Please guys, be serious. - Okay, sorry..

451
00:38:28,558 --> 00:38:33,225
Look, Death's finger.

452
00:38:33,725 --> 00:38:36,141
"I've committed my life to
the freedom of this country.

453
00:38:36,641 --> 00:38:38,225
..I know you want me to get married..

454
00:38:38,725 --> 00:38:40,225
..but I have made freedom my bride.."

455
00:38:40,725 --> 00:38:44,350
"Your son, Bhagat Singh."

456
00:38:44,850 --> 00:38:47,183
Who talks like this for God's sake? - Your son.

457
00:38:47,683 --> 00:38:49,323
My bride is freedom.. what's his problem?

458
00:38:49,766 --> 00:38:51,725
I think it's a good line for Sukhi..

459
00:38:52,025 --> 00:38:53,765
Since no girl is ever going to marry him..

460
00:38:53,766 --> 00:38:56,391
Let freedom be his bride.

461
00:38:56,691 --> 00:38:59,015
Laugh bastards, laugh. I won't
invite you in my marriage.

462
00:38:59,016 --> 00:39:02,516
You were happy just now and now you turned sad.

463
00:39:08,266 --> 00:39:14,058
"What sign did you make by touching my heart?"

464
00:39:14,558 --> 00:39:20,141
"The climate has changed and I have
started liking the environment.."

465
00:39:20,641 --> 00:39:22,891
Wow! Great!

466
00:39:23,391 --> 00:39:26,308
This is the sari round of
the Miss Freedom contest.

467
00:39:26,808 --> 00:39:29,225
Just thought it would help
me get into the character.

468
00:39:29,725 --> 00:39:31,766
Wow! - Idiots.

469
00:39:32,266 --> 00:39:34,725
Hey, Miss Universe .. ..ity.

470
00:39:35,225 --> 00:39:37,558
Look guys this isn't going to work.

471
00:39:38,058 --> 00:39:42,308
You have to work hard to bring out
the characters. And be serious.

472
00:39:42,808 --> 00:39:46,350
Unless you emote from within..

473
00:39:46,850 --> 00:39:49,475
..you won't understand these characters.

474
00:39:49,975 --> 00:39:54,641
Try.. it will come from within you.

475
00:39:55,141 --> 00:39:57,933
See, he's got a hold of his character already.

476
00:39:58,433 --> 00:40:01,141
You understood the character pretty fast.

477
00:40:01,641 --> 00:40:03,433
Please stop it. Just shut up or get out.

478
00:40:03,933 --> 00:40:06,725
See! Now you look like a revolutionary!

479
00:40:07,225 --> 00:40:10,600
Whatever you say Gulabo, you
need me to create the mood.

480
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:12,766
DJ watch it.

481
00:40:13,266 --> 00:40:17,225
Now she's upset! She's is upset..

482
00:40:17,725 --> 00:40:21,683
She is smiling, she will be allured if she smiles.

483
00:40:22,183 --> 00:40:25,766
Those are the words of a 23 year old.

484
00:40:26,266 --> 00:40:29,516
That's how old Bhagat Singh was when he died: 23.

485
00:40:30,016 --> 00:40:31,683
Those were different times Sue.

486
00:40:32,183 --> 00:40:33,663
Today, if you tell people that you ..

487
00:40:33,933 --> 00:40:35,653
..want to give your life for your country..

488
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:39,600
..they'll call you mad.

489
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:41,850
Exactly.

490
00:40:42,350 --> 00:40:47,058
I can't relate to this..

491
00:40:47,558 --> 00:40:48,933
That's it. Don't think.

492
00:40:49,433 --> 00:40:55,058
Feel. Just read the words, and
you'll get what he was feeling.

493
00:40:55,558 --> 00:40:57,183
Why don't we try again?

494
00:40:57,683 --> 00:41:00,933
Let's try again..

495
00:41:01,433 --> 00:41:07,225
I've committed my life to the
freedom of this country. - Good.

496
00:41:07,725 --> 00:41:13,350
..a job.. a well settled life..
These things don't matter anymore.

497
00:41:13,850 --> 00:41:20,850
..I know you want me to get married..

498
00:41:21,350 --> 00:41:24,850
..but I have made freedom my bride..

499
00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:38,350
I the son Mother India.. swear on this..

500
00:41:45,141 --> 00:41:53,141
I the son Mother India..
Swear on this pious fire..

501
00:41:54,225 --> 00:41:56,600
This Aslam is a real stud..

502
00:41:57,100 --> 00:42:03,600
Take a look at the packaging.
Poetry, good looks, reading hands!

503
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:09,808
DJ, I'm scared at times that I'll
remain a bachelor all my life.

504
00:42:10,308 --> 00:42:14,141
Trust me I won't let you die a bachelor.

505
00:42:14,641 --> 00:42:18,391
Promise.. - It's DJ's promise.

506
00:42:18,891 --> 00:42:20,225
Oh no.

507
00:42:20,725 --> 00:42:23,558
"You'll be writing people's destinies..

508
00:42:24,058 --> 00:42:26,100
.." "You'll be bringing them on right path.."

509
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:29,600
Papu, change the channel. - "You
know the art of changing destiny.."

510
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:33,600
"You have to go far beyond the lines.."
- I like that.

511
00:42:38,308 --> 00:42:40,600
Your love line is very strong..

512
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:44,266
The man of your dreams will come
along in a black T-shirt and say:.

513
00:42:44,766 --> 00:42:49,683
"What sign did you make by touching my heart.."

514
00:42:50,183 --> 00:42:53,225
Do I even have a love line?

515
00:42:53,725 --> 00:42:55,285
You must have washed it off in the loo.

516
00:42:55,516 --> 00:42:58,016
"Defence Minister Shastri has also been implicated

517
00:42:58,516 --> 00:43:00,766
in the MIG-21 kickbacks scandal,"

518
00:43:01,266 --> 00:43:05,266
This is really depressing nonsense. Let's go DJ.

519
00:43:05,766 --> 00:43:09,266
"This is a blatant lie. I am
ordering an investigation."

520
00:43:15,141 --> 00:43:17,850
"To the Mahal of the Taj.."

521
00:43:18,350 --> 00:43:21,183
"To the Minar of Kutub.."

522
00:43:21,683 --> 00:43:24,433
"To the Kumari of Kanya.."

523
00:43:24,933 --> 00:43:27,600
"To the beaches of Goa.."

524
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:30,975
"To the whole of India, Zindabad.."

525
00:43:31,475 --> 00:43:33,850
"All have something to say.."

526
00:43:34,350 --> 00:43:35,975
"They all have something to say.."

527
00:43:36,475 --> 00:43:38,891
"All have something to say.."

528
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:42,891
"They all have something to say.."

529
00:43:46,141 --> 00:43:48,975
"India and Pakistan, Bangladesh all in a song.."

530
00:43:49,475 --> 00:43:50,641
"Kajurao in Coimbatore.."

531
00:43:51,141 --> 00:43:55,516
"Everyone all around say, our
school is a school for fun.."

532
00:43:56,016 --> 00:43:58,808
"..everyone all around say, our
school is a school for fun.."

533
00:43:59,308 --> 00:44:00,668
"To all the corners of the earth."

534
00:44:00,975 --> 00:44:02,100
"To what is all our worth."

535
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:06,100
"What is out destiny?"

536
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:11,808
"From the King of India up to the Himalayas."

537
00:44:12,308 --> 00:44:15,141
"Across the Ganga Jamuna."

538
00:44:15,641 --> 00:44:19,141
"Our school is a school filled with fun."

539
00:44:29,058 --> 00:44:32,558
"Lose control.."

540
00:44:44,391 --> 00:44:45,725
Bye. - Bye.

541
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:47,225
See you guys.

542
00:44:47,475 --> 00:44:51,058
You're my buddy.. I'll drop you home.

543
00:44:51,558 --> 00:44:54,433
I don't need any help, it's just two lanes away.
You just sit calmly.

544
00:44:54,933 --> 00:44:58,433
We are not so drunk.. not to remember your home.

545
00:45:05,766 --> 00:45:11,141
We are not so drunk.. not to remember your home.

546
00:45:11,641 --> 00:45:14,141
Idiots!

547
00:45:14,641 --> 00:45:18,141
You're very lucky to have friends like them.

548
00:45:22,558 --> 00:45:25,600
One day this will all end.

549
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:28,766
We'll all go our separate ways.

550
00:45:29,266 --> 00:45:32,100
But you can always keep in touch.

551
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:34,516
Doesn't happen.

552
00:45:35,016 --> 00:45:36,850
Life gets busy.

553
00:45:37,350 --> 00:45:41,433
Too many problems. Getting a job, a house, money.

554
00:45:41,933 --> 00:45:45,433
And then dance to the tune of life.

555
00:45:50,850 --> 00:45:54,558
In college we rule our destinies..

556
00:45:55,058 --> 00:45:58,558
But after college we have to dance to fate's tune.

557
00:46:04,141 --> 00:46:10,350
You know Gulabo, I passed out 5 years ago..

558
00:46:10,850 --> 00:46:12,308
..but I still hang around..

559
00:46:12,808 --> 00:46:15,600
I don't understand.

560
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:19,850
..I don't ever want to leave college.

561
00:46:20,350 --> 00:46:22,766
Why?

562
00:46:23,266 --> 00:46:28,433
At least in the campus I'm someone..
People know me.

563
00:46:28,933 --> 00:46:32,641
DJ's somebody..

564
00:46:33,141 --> 00:46:40,058
People expect me to do something big in life.

565
00:46:40,558 --> 00:46:44,058
But when I'm out on the streets..

566
00:47:00,725 --> 00:47:04,225
It's all the beer's fault.. Everything came out.

567
00:47:11,475 --> 00:47:16,266
You know what else I'm scared of?

568
00:47:16,766 --> 00:47:19,475
Acting in your film.

569
00:47:19,975 --> 00:47:23,475
Don't worry.. you're in safe hands.

570
00:47:32,308 --> 00:47:35,641
"My friend is tall but his lane is small."

571
00:47:36,141 --> 00:47:39,141
It's Aslam's lane.
- Mind you watch it. I am Muhamad Ali.

572
00:47:39,641 --> 00:47:42,558
Don't be silly. Muhamad Ali. - Don't be silly.

573
00:47:43,058 --> 00:47:45,475
Where have you been?

574
00:47:45,975 --> 00:47:49,475
Hello Uncle..

575
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:55,308
We'll catch up tomorrow Aslam..

576
00:47:55,808 --> 00:47:59,308
Let's go.

577
00:48:03,725 --> 00:48:05,266
You've been drinking?

578
00:48:05,766 --> 00:48:08,933
Father, you know I don't drink.

579
00:48:09,433 --> 00:48:12,475
Good-for-nothings..
- Whatever, they're my friends.

580
00:48:12,975 --> 00:48:16,433
Friends! They feel no shame standing in front of..

581
00:48:16,933 --> 00:48:19,641
..your father with alcohol on their breath.

582
00:48:20,141 --> 00:48:22,891
Why can't you get friends in your own community?

583
00:48:23,391 --> 00:48:25,031
Why do you make friends with people who..

584
00:48:25,058 --> 00:48:26,618
..corrupt you, disgrace your religion..

585
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:28,900
This has nothing to do with religion, Father.

586
00:48:29,058 --> 00:48:34,683
Shut up! Don't raise your voice
in the presence of your father.

587
00:48:35,183 --> 00:48:37,391
He's right.

588
00:48:37,891 --> 00:48:43,641
This country has never accepted
Muslims and it never will..

589
00:48:44,141 --> 00:48:46,600
How can you be so passive!

590
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:50,475
Do you ever see me mixing with a Hindu?
Have you ever seen?

591
00:48:50,975 --> 00:48:56,141
I'm not you and I don't want
to be like you brother.

592
00:48:56,641 --> 00:48:58,391
I can't fill myself with so much hate..

593
00:48:58,891 --> 00:49:00,891
Coward that's what you are.

594
00:49:01,391 --> 00:49:02,641
Stop it!

595
00:49:03,141 --> 00:49:05,101
I feel suffocated in this house. It's the same ..

596
00:49:05,391 --> 00:49:08,891
..old thing every single day..

597
00:49:18,225 --> 00:49:21,600
Carnivals will be held on our graves every year,

598
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:25,766
That's all that will be left of
us, when we die for our country.

599
00:49:26,266 --> 00:49:28,975
Well said. - Well said Ashfaq Sahab..

600
00:49:29,375 --> 00:49:31,099
If the English could hear you they would ..

601
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:33,808
..leave this country in a moment.

602
00:49:34,308 --> 00:49:35,975
So what has been decided?

603
00:49:36,475 --> 00:49:42,850
We'll steal the Empire's money
from the train that passes Kakori.

604
00:49:43,350 --> 00:49:46,058
And with that money we will buy arms.

605
00:49:46,558 --> 00:49:48,391
Bismil will explain everything.

606
00:49:48,891 --> 00:49:51,516
Yes Bismil.. Where is my Ram?

607
00:49:52,016 --> 00:49:54,016
Where is my Ram?

608
00:49:54,516 --> 00:49:56,266
I just can't find my Ramprasad Bismil.

609
00:49:56,766 --> 00:49:58,016
Relax. We will find him.

610
00:49:58,516 --> 00:49:59,975
But where? How?

611
00:50:00,475 --> 00:50:02,725
Very soon. Don't you wo..

612
00:50:03,225 --> 00:50:04,558
Oh no.

613
00:50:05,058 --> 00:50:07,933
You won't get Ramprasad Bismil out here.

614
00:50:08,433 --> 00:50:11,016
You need a true Indian.

615
00:50:11,516 --> 00:50:13,516
How can you find Indian revolutionaries amongst..

616
00:50:14,016 --> 00:50:16,600
..people who want to be Westerners?

617
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:18,308
Ignore him. Let's go.

618
00:50:18,808 --> 00:50:23,641
Ramprasad Bismil wished to
be reborn a hundred times..

619
00:50:24,141 --> 00:50:27,141
..so that he could give his life for
his country a hundred times over.

620
00:50:27,641 --> 00:50:29,391
Let's go from here Su.

621
00:50:29,891 --> 00:50:33,391
So where do you think I can find my Bismil?

622
00:50:39,350 --> 00:50:42,933
I don't believe this.

623
00:50:43,433 --> 00:50:49,350
'The desire to rebel now fills our hearts'

624
00:50:49,850 --> 00:50:55,683
'We have yet to test the strength
of the murderer's might'

625
00:50:56,183 --> 00:50:59,766
'Why does he not say a word?

626
00:51:00,266 --> 00:51:06,558
'The one in my sights has his lips sealed'

627
00:51:07,058 --> 00:51:11,558
'O martyrs, O men of valour,
I'd give my life for you'

628
00:51:12,058 --> 00:51:16,933
'In every lane even the enemy
sings your praise these days'

629
00:51:17,433 --> 00:51:21,558
'When the time will come,
we shall show you, O sky'

630
00:51:22,058 --> 00:51:27,141
'What is the point in speaking
now of what lies in our hearts?'

631
00:51:27,641 --> 00:51:31,308
' They drag us all together in hope of execution'

632
00:51:31,808 --> 00:51:35,391
'Those fired by passion are
gathered in the murderer's lane'

633
00:51:35,891 --> 00:51:40,225
'We have yet to test the strength
of the murderer's might'

634
00:51:40,725 --> 00:51:47,433
The desire to rebel now fills our hearts

635
00:51:47,933 --> 00:51:51,433
' We have yet to test the
strength of the murderer's might'

636
00:52:06,016 --> 00:52:08,433
Sue, this isn't London. You don't know what kind..

637
00:52:08,633 --> 00:52:10,224
..of scum, men like Laxman Pandey are.

638
00:52:10,225 --> 00:52:13,975
Look Sue if he is a part of
this, then I can't do the film.

639
00:52:14,475 --> 00:52:17,225
If you have any problems
with me say it on my face.

640
00:52:17,725 --> 00:52:21,516
Don't stab me in the back like a coward.

641
00:52:22,016 --> 00:52:24,766
Pandey leave! We don't want trouble..

642
00:52:25,266 --> 00:52:28,350
Speak you coward. What were you saying?

643
00:52:28,850 --> 00:52:33,641
Aslam, sit here. Where are you going?

644
00:52:34,141 --> 00:52:35,341
Bastard, what were you saying?

645
00:52:35,516 --> 00:52:38,350
Hey you! How dare you hit Aslam

646
00:52:38,850 --> 00:52:40,016
Don't spare him.

647
00:52:40,516 --> 00:52:43,683
Sukhi! - Stop it please.. Karan, stop him..

648
00:52:44,183 --> 00:52:48,683
Thrash the bastard! Thrash the bastard!
Thrash the bastard!

649
00:52:49,183 --> 00:52:52,183
Sonia do something.

650
00:52:52,683 --> 00:52:55,808
Hey hit him.. - Stop it..

651
00:52:56,308 --> 00:53:02,641
Stop it.. Stop it.. Stop it..
Stop it before I say..

652
00:53:03,141 --> 00:53:04,766
Aslam, do something

653
00:53:05,266 --> 00:53:13,183
Stop it.. Stop it.. Stop it..
Stop it before I say.

654
00:53:13,683 --> 00:53:20,975
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I took you guys in my film.

655
00:53:21,475 --> 00:53:23,558
God knows what made me come here..

656
00:53:24,058 --> 00:53:27,600
I was so stupid to pack my
bags and come to a place..

657
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:32,516
..where people are just looking
for an excuse to kill each other.

658
00:53:33,016 --> 00:53:36,516
Well atleast now you all
will have one less excuse.

659
00:54:22,141 --> 00:54:25,641
Sue!

660
00:54:38,058 --> 00:54:40,641
Sue! Sue, we are sorry.

661
00:54:41,141 --> 00:54:43,902
You know we've got a problem with Pandey.
There's a lot of bad blood.

662
00:54:44,266 --> 00:54:49,391
And if I stay, it's sure to happen again.
- No, Sue. I am saying it.

663
00:54:49,891 --> 00:54:50,891
We've worked it out.

664
00:54:51,266 --> 00:54:54,766
You won't have any problems.

665
00:54:59,225 --> 00:55:06,100
Sue.. we all know how much this film means to you.

666
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:11,641
We want to help you finish
what you came here to do.

667
00:55:12,141 --> 00:55:13,766
Everyone wants you to stay.

668
00:55:14,266 --> 00:55:17,766
I want you to stay.

669
00:55:20,266 --> 00:55:23,391
Say something..

670
00:55:23,891 --> 00:55:27,475
I am scared.

671
00:55:27,975 --> 00:55:32,975
Don't worry, you're in safe hands.

672
00:55:33,475 --> 00:55:36,975
Come on.. Get up. ..Come here.

673
00:55:49,808 --> 00:55:51,768
"If a girl smiles it means that she is allured.."

674
00:55:51,933 --> 00:55:55,475
Hey brother she will stay back.
She's not going anywhere.

675
00:55:55,975 --> 00:55:59,308
You are a good actor. Now, clean the room.

676
00:55:59,808 --> 00:56:02,725
Now just chill. Look at this.

677
00:56:03,225 --> 00:56:07,350
The next four weeks were the
hardest of my entire life.

678
00:56:07,850 --> 00:56:11,350
And the happiest.

679
00:56:13,433 --> 00:56:17,058
God is one. Truth is His name

680
00:56:17,558 --> 00:56:19,433
He is the Creator

681
00:56:19,933 --> 00:56:23,308
The Fearless. Without Enmity.

682
00:56:23,808 --> 00:56:25,766
The Immortal

683
00:56:26,266 --> 00:56:29,933
The Unborn, Self-illuminated

684
00:56:30,433 --> 00:56:32,350
By the grace of the Guru

685
00:56:32,850 --> 00:56:33,933
Recite

686
00:56:34,433 --> 00:56:35,600
True in the beginning

687
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:37,391
True before Time

688
00:56:37,891 --> 00:56:39,058
True in the present

689
00:56:39,558 --> 00:56:44,600
Guru Nanak will be forever true

690
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:47,766
Thought cannot create Him

691
00:56:48,266 --> 00:56:50,975
Even though one may try

692
00:56:51,475 --> 00:56:54,016
He cannot be attained through silence

693
00:56:54,516 --> 00:56:57,391
Even though meditation is unbroken

694
00:56:57,891 --> 00:57:02,725
The devout's hunger for God can never be satisfied

695
00:57:03,225 --> 00:57:06,183
Despite the many worldly riches you may have

696
00:57:06,683 --> 00:57:12,891
Use the riches as you will. But
none will help you to attain God

697
00:57:13,391 --> 00:57:18,100
How shall a man justify himself?

698
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:21,725
How can the screen of falsehood be torn?

699
00:57:22,225 --> 00:57:30,225
Nanak, by abiding the will
of God as ordained by Him

700
00:57:31,766 --> 00:57:35,266
The Pure belong to God. And Victory is God's alone

701
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:04,558
"Take some soil of my land.."

702
00:58:05,058 --> 00:58:13,058
"Take some soil of my land,
the scent of this air.."

703
00:58:14,350 --> 00:58:18,475
"Add the breath of my being,
the throbbing of my heart.."

704
00:58:18,975 --> 00:58:24,433
"And the zeal, that races through my blood.."

705
00:58:24,933 --> 00:58:29,058
"Take all these, and stir it. Then
watch as it brings out the colour"

706
00:58:29,558 --> 00:58:33,641
"Take all these, and stir it. Then
watch as it brings out the colour"

707
00:58:34,141 --> 00:58:36,581
"Watch as it brings out the
colour of patriotism, my friend."

708
00:58:36,850 --> 00:58:40,308
"Watch as it brings out the colour." ..

709
00:58:40,808 --> 00:58:42,850
"Watch as it brings out the colour.."

710
00:58:43,350 --> 00:58:45,100
"Watch as it brings out the colour.." ..

711
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:47,433
"Watch as it brings out the colour.."

712
00:58:47,933 --> 00:58:49,641
"Watch as it brings out the colour.."

713
00:58:50,141 --> 00:58:51,975
"Watch as it brings out the colour.."

714
00:58:52,475 --> 00:58:54,266
"Watch as it brings out the colour.." ..

715
00:58:54,766 --> 00:58:56,600
"Watch as it brings out the colour.."

716
00:58:57,100 --> 00:58:58,808
"Watch as it brings out the colour.." ..

717
00:58:59,308 --> 00:59:00,808
"Watch as it brings out the colour.."

718
00:59:01,308 --> 00:59:02,933
"Watch as it brings out the colour.." ..

719
00:59:03,433 --> 00:59:07,391
"Watch as it brings out the colour.."

720
00:59:07,891 --> 00:59:09,016
Bismil's sent a message..

721
00:59:09,516 --> 00:59:11,308
..that the Lucknow train..

722
00:59:11,808 --> 00:59:14,933
..carrying the Empire's money..
Will be looted by us in Kakori..

723
00:59:15,433 --> 00:59:17,516
..while eating Kakori kababs.

724
00:59:18,016 --> 00:59:21,016
And we will buy bombs with that money.
What will we buy? Bombs.

725
00:59:21,516 --> 00:59:23,975
Leave her alone.. She will stop giving milk.

726
00:59:24,475 --> 00:59:28,516
"Give colour to your dreams.
And those of your people."

727
00:59:29,016 --> 00:59:33,100
"Give colour to your happiness.
And your sadness too."

728
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:37,516
"Give colour to generations..
Give colour to the field.."

729
00:59:37,916 --> 00:59:40,515
"Give colour to the beat of your heart.
And that of your music."

730
00:59:40,516 --> 00:59:42,756
"Give colour to every cheek.
Give colour to your eyes.."

731
00:59:42,933 --> 00:59:45,373
"Watch as it brings out the
colour of patriotism my friend.."

732
00:59:45,475 --> 00:59:47,600
"Watch as it brings out the colour.."

733
00:59:48,100 --> 00:59:56,100
"Take some soil of my land,
the scent of this air.."

734
00:59:57,308 --> 01:00:01,308
"Add the breath of my being,
the throbbing of my heart."

735
01:00:01,808 --> 01:00:07,433
"And the zeal, that races through my blood.."

736
01:00:07,933 --> 01:00:12,100
"Take all these and stir it. Then
watch as it brings out the colour"

737
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:16,683
"Take all these and stir it. Then
watch as it brings out the colour"

738
01:00:17,183 --> 01:00:19,663
"Watch as it brings out the colour
of patriotism, my friend.."

739
01:00:19,808 --> 01:00:21,558
"Watch as it brings out the colour.."

740
01:00:22,058 --> 01:00:27,558
Bismil's message and the Train
going to Lucknow. Hey Chotu!

741
01:00:28,058 --> 01:00:29,218
Did you get Bismil's message?

742
01:00:29,433 --> 01:00:30,725
No. - No! Then Listen..

743
01:00:31,225 --> 01:00:32,985
The train that is leaving after eight days..

744
01:00:33,016 --> 01:00:34,475
.. we will loot it in Kakori..

745
01:00:34,975 --> 01:00:36,600
It's loaded with the Empire's money.

746
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:38,100
Will you loot it? - No.

747
01:00:38,516 --> 01:00:40,850
Oye.. we will be buying arms from it.

748
01:00:41,350 --> 01:00:42,390
What will we buy? - Arms..

749
01:00:42,683 --> 01:00:43,808
Yes.. Very Good.. go now.

750
01:00:44,308 --> 01:00:48,558
"On a slow fire, won't you,
put this passion to cook.."

751
01:00:49,058 --> 01:00:53,308
"Then as it simmers, add a babbling brook.."
- Let's rock!

752
01:00:53,808 --> 01:00:57,725
"Add a river, and an ocean.
Maybe a pot of water.."

753
01:00:58,225 --> 01:01:00,183
"Then sprinkle a bit. Stir it all up."

754
01:01:00,683 --> 01:01:02,558
"And watch as it brings out the colour.."

755
01:01:03,058 --> 01:01:08,850
"Watch as it brings out the colour
of patriotism, my friend.."

756
01:01:09,350 --> 01:01:11,225
Bismil has sent a message..

757
01:01:11,725 --> 01:01:12,975
..the Lucknow train..

758
01:01:13,475 --> 01:01:14,975
..which carries the Empire's money..

759
01:01:15,475 --> 01:01:18,475
..will be looted by us in seven days, in Kakori..

760
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:20,683
And we will buy bombs with that money.

761
01:01:21,183 --> 01:01:25,266
"Now paint the whole town with it.
Paint your very being."

762
01:01:25,766 --> 01:01:29,891
"Paint your every vein with it.
Paint it with a smile.."

763
01:01:30,391 --> 01:01:32,141
"Paint those childhood years, won't you.

764
01:01:32,641 --> 01:01:34,391
Paint the flush of youth.."

765
01:01:34,891 --> 01:01:39,058
"Don't hesitate, my friend. Paint
your patriotism over everything.."

766
01:01:39,558 --> 01:01:44,141
"Watch as it brings out the colour
of patriotism, my friend.."

767
01:01:44,641 --> 01:01:48,683
"Take some soil of my land.."

768
01:01:49,183 --> 01:01:57,183
"Take some soil of my land,
the scent of this air.."

769
01:01:58,558 --> 01:02:02,600
"Add the breath of my being,
the throbbing of my heart.."

770
01:02:03,100 --> 01:02:08,641
"And the zeal, that races through my blood.."

771
01:02:09,141 --> 01:02:13,350
"Take all these and stir it. Then
watch as it brings out the colour"

772
01:02:13,850 --> 01:02:20,141
"Watch as it brings out the
colour of patriotism, my friend."

773
01:02:20,641 --> 01:02:22,516
"Watch as it brings out the colour."

774
01:02:23,016 --> 01:02:24,766
"Watch as it brings out the colour of.."

775
01:02:25,266 --> 01:02:26,866
"Watch as it brings out the colour of.."

776
01:02:27,141 --> 01:02:31,225
"Watch as it brings out the colour of.."

777
01:02:31,725 --> 01:02:37,975
"Watch as it brings out the colour of.."

778
01:02:38,475 --> 01:02:42,683
"Watch as it brings out the colour of.."

779
01:02:43,183 --> 01:02:46,683
"Watch as it brings out the colour of.."

780
01:02:53,058 --> 01:02:56,766
"Watch as it brings out the colour of.."

781
01:02:57,266 --> 01:03:01,683
"Watch as it brings out the colour of.."

782
01:03:02,183 --> 01:03:07,016
"Watch as it brings out the colour of.."

783
01:03:07,516 --> 01:03:15,516
"Watch as it brings out the
colour of patriotism, my friend."

784
01:03:19,016 --> 01:03:27,016
The Kakori robbery on August 9th
1925 that's where it all started.

785
01:03:28,141 --> 01:03:31,641
Nothing would ever be the same after that.

786
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:50,058
British Officers.. around 20 to 25 of them.

787
01:03:50,458 --> 01:03:52,557
We have to call it off! We've
nearly reached Kakori.

788
01:03:52,558 --> 01:03:56,058
Stop Ashfaq, quick.

789
01:04:02,808 --> 01:04:05,266
Ashfaq, stop!

790
01:04:05,766 --> 01:04:09,266
It's too late to back out now.. Come on.. Move!

791
01:04:25,808 --> 01:04:29,308
Get inside!

792
01:04:41,308 --> 01:04:42,725
Keep the windows shut..

793
01:04:43,225 --> 01:04:44,933
..no Indian will be hurt..

794
01:04:45,433 --> 01:04:46,850
Come on!

795
01:04:47,350 --> 01:04:49,558
The keys! - You won't get away with this.

796
01:04:50,058 --> 01:04:52,641
Give me the keys!
- I don't have it. I don't have it.

797
01:04:53,141 --> 01:04:56,641
Banwari get the sledge-hammer.

798
01:04:58,891 --> 01:05:02,391
I'll handle them. You go get the money..

799
01:05:16,683 --> 01:05:20,641
Kakori had sent shock waves
throughout the establishment.

800
01:05:21,141 --> 01:05:23,808
But we had none to blame but ourselves.

801
01:05:24,308 --> 01:05:27,808
What we were hearing were
the echoes of our own guns.

802
01:05:38,391 --> 01:05:42,850
Fire..

803
01:05:43,350 --> 01:05:46,058
Load.

804
01:05:46,558 --> 01:05:50,058
Fire..

805
01:05:55,058 --> 01:05:58,558
Load

806
01:06:00,766 --> 01:06:04,266
Fire..

807
01:07:08,100 --> 01:07:11,350
Jallianwala Baug meeting
essentially nonviolent people..

808
01:07:11,850 --> 01:07:13,225
..considered taking up arms.

809
01:07:13,725 --> 01:07:16,850
This was when Bhagat Singh
stepped out of the shadows..

810
01:07:17,350 --> 01:07:19,225
..to claim his destiny.

811
01:07:19,725 --> 01:07:23,350
I've committed my life to the
freedom of this country.

812
01:07:23,850 --> 01:07:28,933
Comfort and other worldly
desires do not attract me.

813
01:07:29,433 --> 01:07:33,225
I know you want me to get
married and settle down..

814
01:07:33,725 --> 01:07:35,683
..like all parents do.

815
01:07:36,183 --> 01:07:39,600
But freedom is my bride.

816
01:07:40,100 --> 01:07:44,308
I hope you'll forgive me. Your most obedient son..

817
01:07:44,808 --> 01:07:48,058
Bhagat Singh.

818
01:07:48,558 --> 01:07:49,850
Cut.

819
01:07:50,350 --> 01:07:53,850
Let's take a break.

820
01:07:57,350 --> 01:08:00,850
Breakfast? No..

821
01:08:21,016 --> 01:08:22,016
Put it there.

822
01:08:22,141 --> 01:08:29,600
General Dyer? How can one even think
of doing something like this?

823
01:08:30,100 --> 01:08:32,100
I can't believe that he actually killed more..

824
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:34,200
.. than 400 people at Jallianwala Baugh.

825
01:08:34,683 --> 01:08:37,350
379.. that was the official figure.

826
01:08:37,850 --> 01:08:40,100
Actually nearly 1000 people were butchered..

827
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:44,100
Here.

828
01:08:47,766 --> 01:08:53,308
Last year at the tomb of Peer Sai,
I prayed for Daljeet's well being.

829
01:08:53,808 --> 01:08:54,933
Who's Daljeet?

830
01:08:55,433 --> 01:08:58,308
We were the epitome of tolerance.

831
01:08:58,808 --> 01:09:01,350
Even an ant reacts. But we are conditioned ..

832
01:09:01,850 --> 01:09:03,766
..to take everything lying down.

833
01:09:04,266 --> 01:09:05,546
Rubbish! It's today's generation

834
01:09:05,875 --> 01:09:07,432
.. which lacks the will to do anything

835
01:09:07,433 --> 01:09:09,193
Have you ever heard of Shaheed Uddham Singh?

836
01:09:09,308 --> 01:09:13,183
He went all the way to
London and killed that Dyer.

837
01:09:13,683 --> 01:09:16,475
..because he was also a part of
the Jallianwala Baugh massacre.

838
01:09:16,975 --> 01:09:20,558
Eat it Sonia. The butter
will strengthen your bones.

839
01:09:21,058 --> 01:09:24,766
In Punjab every mother sends
at least one son to the army.

840
01:09:25,266 --> 01:09:28,100
Why should we retreat?
Sacrifice runs in our blood.

841
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:30,683
Only idiots like DJ retreat.

842
01:09:31,183 --> 01:09:32,725
Why does it always come back to me?

843
01:09:33,225 --> 01:09:35,850
Shut up and eat your paratha.
Gollu, bring the lassi.

844
01:09:36,350 --> 01:09:38,891
We are taught from our
childhood to adjust our self.

845
01:09:39,391 --> 01:09:41,058
Six people sitting on a seat for four..

846
01:09:41,558 --> 01:09:47,225
..someone will squeeze in and say Please adjust!

847
01:09:47,725 --> 01:09:51,975
Hey! Why are you adjusting? Come sit, sit.

848
01:09:52,475 --> 01:09:58,308
Hey, brother, hey, brother.

849
01:09:58,808 --> 01:10:01,516
Strange. Isn't it?

850
01:10:02,016 --> 01:10:09,850
We are being hunted like
animals in our own country..

851
01:10:10,350 --> 01:10:13,725
Ashfaq you should cross the
border and get to Afghanistan..

852
01:10:14,225 --> 01:10:15,725
We have many Muslim friends there.

853
01:10:16,225 --> 01:10:17,725
You will be safe with them.

854
01:10:18,225 --> 01:10:20,016
After all you're one of their own.

855
01:10:20,516 --> 01:10:22,225
One of their own? - Hmm..

856
01:10:22,725 --> 01:10:26,225
Why am I not one of your own?

857
01:10:28,100 --> 01:10:31,016
Ashfaq.. I never meant..

858
01:10:31,516 --> 01:10:34,975
Ashfaq..

859
01:10:35,475 --> 01:10:38,641
I didn't mean to hurt you.

860
01:10:39,141 --> 01:10:42,141
This is your country as much as it is mine.

861
01:10:42,641 --> 01:10:48,766
You have a right to fight and die for it too..

862
01:10:49,266 --> 01:10:51,808
Forgive me. - Ram, let us not talk of dying..

863
01:10:52,308 --> 01:10:55,808
I pray that we all live to see our
children live in a free country.

864
01:11:01,850 --> 01:11:05,350
Ram run!

865
01:12:02,391 --> 01:12:05,891
Run.. Run..

866
01:12:18,266 --> 01:12:20,725
Where are your other friends?

867
01:12:21,225 --> 01:12:24,725
Where's Azad?

868
01:12:27,308 --> 01:12:31,683
Azad was not a man to be found easily.

869
01:12:32,183 --> 01:12:37,350
A master of disguises appeared
and vanished at will.

870
01:12:37,850 --> 01:12:39,690
After months of frustration a break through ..

871
01:12:40,100 --> 01:12:42,391
.. came for the British Government.

872
01:12:42,891 --> 01:12:47,433
Banwari Lal, weakest of the
revolutionaries in captivity.

873
01:12:47,933 --> 01:12:51,058
The man who had given us the whereabouts of..

874
01:12:51,558 --> 01:12:55,058
..Bismil and Ashfaqulla agreed
to be the bait to trap Azad.

875
01:13:12,100 --> 01:13:15,600
Banwari!

876
01:14:20,691 --> 01:14:25,441
Okay! "Just make an eye to
eye contact and learn.."

877
01:14:25,941 --> 01:14:27,400
I loved those songs and dances.

878
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:30,190
That's the reason we make films
in this country.. to dance.

879
01:14:30,191 --> 01:14:33,358
Hey, you Hollywood's relative.

880
01:14:33,858 --> 01:14:36,900
"Just make an eye contact.."

881
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:39,441
So where are we going? - Yes, where are we going?

882
01:14:39,941 --> 01:14:42,150
Hello! Where?

883
01:14:42,650 --> 01:14:46,150
Special day, special place! - Special Day?

884
01:15:57,608 --> 01:16:00,691
It's amazing. - Isn't it?

885
01:16:01,191 --> 01:16:05,733
Ever since I was a kid I used to come here..

886
01:16:06,233 --> 01:16:08,941
..to watch planes take off.. and watch ..

887
01:16:09,441 --> 01:16:12,941
.. them till they don't disappear in the sky.

888
01:16:43,941 --> 01:16:45,858
These guys have gone crazy!

889
01:16:46,358 --> 01:16:48,275
Come on, face it, you'd love to do that really.

890
01:16:48,775 --> 01:16:50,691
What? Take my shirt off and howl at planes.

891
01:16:51,191 --> 01:16:53,441
I won't mind if you do.

892
01:16:53,941 --> 01:16:57,441
Dream on buddy..

893
01:17:02,691 --> 01:17:04,816
Hey, Wild people. - Boys and girls and ..

894
01:17:05,316 --> 01:17:06,756
.. Sukhi who is always after girls..

895
01:17:07,191 --> 01:17:08,191
Why me all the time?

896
01:17:08,483 --> 01:17:11,400
I want to make a special announcement..

897
01:17:11,900 --> 01:17:16,150
Ma'am, I was wondering if you'd like to ..

898
01:17:16,650 --> 01:17:20,150
.. spend the rest of your life with me..

899
01:17:24,691 --> 01:17:28,191
Will you please marry me?

900
01:17:31,108 --> 01:17:36,150
This is a real love.

901
01:17:36,650 --> 01:17:40,150
"Ajay has done it.." "Ajay has done it.."

902
01:18:16,858 --> 01:18:24,858
"Without saying a word, you steal my heart."

903
01:18:28,900 --> 01:18:36,441
"I'll find happiness by your..

904
01:18:36,941 --> 01:18:44,941
..side I can't stay apart."

905
01:18:45,983 --> 01:18:53,983
"My life tastes sweet now..

906
01:19:00,566 --> 01:19:07,483
..since you walked..

907
01:19:07,983 --> 01:19:15,983
.. through that door."

908
01:19:17,025 --> 01:19:24,400
"When your arms wrap around me..

909
01:19:24,900 --> 01:19:32,900
..I know I've found my shore."

910
01:19:33,983 --> 01:19:40,400
"Without saying a word..

911
01:19:40,900 --> 01:19:44,400
..you steal my heart."

912
01:20:17,608 --> 01:20:23,650
"Sweep through the streets of..

913
01:20:24,150 --> 01:20:32,150
..my mind Like a gentle spring."

914
01:20:33,650 --> 01:20:39,566
"Walk through the corridors of my heart..

915
01:20:40,066 --> 01:20:48,066
..fill the caravan of my dreams."

916
01:20:48,650 --> 01:20:55,483
"I sway to the song..

917
01:20:55,983 --> 01:21:03,983
..of your soul."

918
01:21:05,775 --> 01:21:12,025
"Without saying a word..

919
01:21:12,525 --> 01:21:20,191
..you steal my heart."

920
01:21:20,691 --> 01:21:27,941
"I'll find happiness by your side..

921
01:21:28,441 --> 01:21:31,941
..I can't stay apart."

922
01:21:50,108 --> 01:21:56,441
The first thing that hit me
about this man was his voice.

923
01:21:56,941 --> 01:22:00,441
I knew then my job was not going to be easy.

924
01:22:00,941 --> 01:22:02,441
I'll come back later.

925
01:22:02,941 --> 01:22:09,733
My prayers won't stop till
my country gets its freedom.

926
01:22:10,233 --> 01:22:13,691
I don't think you can wait till then.

927
01:22:14,191 --> 01:22:19,733
My name is James McKinley. I'm
here to find out from you..

928
01:22:20,233 --> 01:22:23,566
..where Azad and the other terrorists are hiding.

929
01:22:24,066 --> 01:22:30,566
Not terrorists. Revolutionaries.
Call them Revolutionaries.

930
01:22:42,650 --> 01:22:50,608
Breaking a man bit by bit, they
said it would get easier by time.

931
01:22:51,108 --> 01:22:54,608
It never did.

932
01:23:27,691 --> 01:23:32,233
The torture went on for sometime
but Bismil didn't break.

933
01:23:32,733 --> 01:23:36,233
Also Ashfaq.

934
01:23:38,066 --> 01:23:43,441
Both men had made pain their
friend, they didn't break.

935
01:23:43,941 --> 01:23:46,483
Instead they did something that I had never ..

936
01:23:46,983 --> 01:23:50,483
.. seen any prisoner do before.

937
01:24:04,775 --> 01:24:08,900
Death cannot take you Ashfaq..

938
01:24:09,400 --> 01:24:15,150
.. live in people's hearts and minds.

939
01:24:15,650 --> 01:24:18,441
..as the torture tore their bodies apart.

940
01:24:18,941 --> 01:24:23,525
I think it was the poetry that
held their souls together..

941
01:24:24,025 --> 01:24:27,983
The torture didn't work so
we thought of other ways.

942
01:24:28,483 --> 01:24:32,275
This is the Holy Quran.

943
01:24:32,775 --> 01:24:37,150
Hindus like Bismil will create
a country for themselves.

944
01:24:37,650 --> 01:24:40,650
They're just using you.

945
01:24:41,150 --> 01:24:42,710
He's not fighting for Hindu freedom, ..

946
01:24:43,025 --> 01:24:45,816
.. he's fighting for Hindustan's freedom.

947
01:24:46,316 --> 01:24:49,733
But you won't be able to understand this.

948
01:24:50,233 --> 01:24:53,733
You've been a slave so long
you've begun to like it.

949
01:24:58,858 --> 01:25:03,941
Tell us where Azad and the other terrorists are..

950
01:25:04,441 --> 01:25:07,941
..You can still save yourself.

951
01:25:15,150 --> 01:25:16,483
19 December.

952
01:25:16,983 --> 01:25:19,858
It's not your fault, Mr. McKinley..

953
01:25:20,358 --> 01:25:22,816
..you're only doing your duty.

954
01:25:23,316 --> 01:25:27,441
How can I stay loyal?

955
01:25:27,941 --> 01:25:31,858
Tell me..

956
01:25:32,358 --> 01:25:36,483
Tell me.

957
01:25:36,983 --> 01:25:40,483
How can this be the will of God?

958
01:25:53,025 --> 01:25:56,525
Things have become harder for me.

959
01:25:59,233 --> 01:26:02,733
I have not been made to kill these people.

960
01:27:16,358 --> 01:27:19,858
Hey, hey guys what's up?

961
01:27:23,691 --> 01:27:26,608
What's wrong? Did someone die?

962
01:27:27,108 --> 01:27:31,441
Sue.. I haven't seen these guys so serious.

963
01:27:31,941 --> 01:27:33,941
What are you doing to my friends?

964
01:27:34,441 --> 01:27:39,733
It's not me.. it's them. They've
really begun to get into this.

965
01:27:40,233 --> 01:27:42,441
Hey Laxman, aren't you coming along?

966
01:27:42,941 --> 01:27:44,066
No. Some other time.

967
01:27:44,566 --> 01:27:46,483
Come on. It's my last night in town.

968
01:27:46,983 --> 01:27:48,316
I'm not really hungry.

969
01:27:48,816 --> 01:27:53,400
Watch us eat then. Come on.

970
01:27:53,900 --> 01:27:57,400
Come on.

971
01:28:08,316 --> 01:28:11,775
To two lovebirds.. may they always be happy.

972
01:28:12,275 --> 01:28:18,691
May the insanity and romance never die. Cheers.

973
01:28:19,191 --> 01:28:23,150
I said cheers guys. - Cheers. Cheers.. Cheers..

974
01:28:23,650 --> 01:28:25,525
I'm insane only about two things in my life.

975
01:28:26,025 --> 01:28:28,941
Sonia and flying.

976
01:28:29,441 --> 01:28:36,691
"What is my heart, take also my life.."

977
01:28:37,191 --> 01:28:42,025
You're lucky to feel so
passionately about something.

978
01:28:42,525 --> 01:28:44,525
You have your poetry Aslam.

979
01:28:45,025 --> 01:28:47,274
Just like DJ has his singing.

980
01:28:47,275 --> 01:28:48,940
Everyone has passion for something inside ..

981
01:28:48,941 --> 01:28:50,315
.. them, they just have to find this 'thing'.

982
01:28:50,316 --> 01:28:52,150
Just like our revolutionaries..

983
01:28:52,450 --> 01:28:54,357
..their passion for freedom was greater than ..

984
01:28:54,358 --> 01:28:55,733
.. their love for their own lives.

985
01:28:56,233 --> 01:29:00,983
There's nothing in this world worth
giving your life for. Nothing!

986
01:29:01,483 --> 01:29:03,858
Correct, except Umrao Jaan.

987
01:29:04,358 --> 01:29:07,358
Just once.. - Repeat.

988
01:29:07,858 --> 01:29:08,858
Easy DJ..

989
01:29:09,316 --> 01:29:10,858
Yes mama.

990
01:29:11,358 --> 01:29:14,400
Come on Karan, there are things
worth giving your life for Karan.

991
01:29:14,900 --> 01:29:16,025
Please.

992
01:29:16,425 --> 01:29:18,190
Like what? Look at Bhagat Singh and Azad ..

993
01:29:18,191 --> 01:29:19,391
.. and the rest of those guys.

994
01:29:19,733 --> 01:29:21,293
They gave their lives for this country.

995
01:29:21,691 --> 01:29:24,525
Look what happened. All for nothing.

996
01:29:25,025 --> 01:29:30,191
It's a shit-hole today. Does
any one care about them?

997
01:29:30,691 --> 01:29:31,691
I give a shit.

998
01:29:32,191 --> 01:29:35,691
People like Ajay who fight for
their country give a shit.

999
01:29:36,191 --> 01:29:38,066
So that people like you can sleep peacefully.

1000
01:29:38,566 --> 01:29:42,566
Give life. - Sonia get real.

1001
01:29:43,066 --> 01:29:44,150
Sonia's right.

1002
01:29:44,650 --> 01:29:48,150
Sue, it's all-fine for a foreigner
like you to say all this..

1003
01:29:48,650 --> 01:29:52,900
Out here we're fighting for basics..

1004
01:29:53,400 --> 01:29:54,775
..food, clothing and shelter.

1005
01:29:55,275 --> 01:29:58,983
Out here you try to change things
you'll get even more screwed.

1006
01:29:59,483 --> 01:30:02,941
Corruption is in our DNA.

1007
01:30:03,441 --> 01:30:04,881
There is no future for this country.

1008
01:30:05,275 --> 01:30:09,400
She's talking about the past,
you're thinking about the future..

1009
01:30:09,900 --> 01:30:11,983
One leg in the past and one leg in the future..

1010
01:30:12,483 --> 01:30:14,358
..that's why we're pissing on the present..

1011
01:30:14,858 --> 01:30:18,358
DJ just shut up. For once in life get serious.

1012
01:30:22,691 --> 01:30:28,275
Karan, it's easy to sit on the
outside and be a critic..

1013
01:30:28,775 --> 01:30:32,150
..blaming others is even easier.

1014
01:30:32,650 --> 01:30:34,250
If you have so many problems then why ..

1015
01:30:34,366 --> 01:30:36,149
.. don't you go out there and change things?

1016
01:30:36,150 --> 01:30:37,775
This is your country too.

1017
01:30:38,275 --> 01:30:42,900
Join politics, the police force,
government and clean it up.

1018
01:30:43,400 --> 01:30:46,691
But you won't! I'll tell you why..

1019
01:30:47,191 --> 01:30:53,400
Because that takes hard work. It's easier to crib.

1020
01:30:53,900 --> 01:30:56,900
If you have dare then try
yourself to change this country.

1021
01:30:57,400 --> 01:30:58,775
Nothing's going to change.

1022
01:30:59,275 --> 01:31:03,025
You can go to your grave trying..
It won't make any difference.

1023
01:31:03,525 --> 01:31:08,233
Correct.. the only difference will
be how you go to your grave..

1024
01:31:08,733 --> 01:31:12,275
DJ Releax. - I am relaxed.

1025
01:31:12,775 --> 01:31:19,941
I'm not drunk. Am I drunk Sue? - No.

1026
01:31:20,441 --> 01:31:26,775
See, the director's word is final. Cut it!

1027
01:31:27,275 --> 01:31:30,108
Where were we?

1028
01:31:30,608 --> 01:31:31,775
On the way to our graves.

1029
01:31:32,275 --> 01:31:39,108
Yes, we all will be carried in
the same style to our graves.

1030
01:31:39,608 --> 01:31:43,525
We'll all be wrapped in white shrouds when we die.

1031
01:31:44,025 --> 01:31:48,441
Only Ajay will be wrapped in the national flag.
- DJ stop it.

1032
01:31:48,941 --> 01:31:52,316
Karan, you can say whatever you want,

1033
01:31:52,816 --> 01:31:57,066
Not even the street dogs will bark when we die.

1034
01:31:57,566 --> 01:32:01,066
But Ajay will get a 21 gun salute.

1035
01:32:11,025 --> 01:32:17,900
Left, Right. Left, Right. Left, Right..

1036
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:22,483
What are you doing? - Attention! - Attention!

1037
01:32:22,983 --> 01:32:26,483
1Move forward! - Move forward.

1038
01:32:41,441 --> 01:32:43,650
Karan, this is for you.

1039
01:32:44,150 --> 01:32:45,608
For me? Thanks dude.

1040
01:32:46,108 --> 01:32:47,858
The girls fall for him anyway..

1041
01:32:48,358 --> 01:32:49,918
If anyone deserves the jacket, it's me.

1042
01:32:50,025 --> 01:32:52,941
Wow! What a dutiful daughter-in-law.

1043
01:32:53,441 --> 01:32:57,066
Now you see, she will touch her f fianc's feet.

1044
01:32:57,566 --> 01:33:01,108
DJ's right. Touch my feet, madam.

1045
01:33:01,608 --> 01:33:03,233
Come on. - Stupid.

1046
01:33:03,733 --> 01:33:07,400
See what women in this
country have to put up with?

1047
01:33:07,900 --> 01:33:11,608
I think DJ's right. You should
respect your traditions.

1048
01:33:12,108 --> 01:33:13,233
See, even Sue agrees..

1049
01:33:13,733 --> 01:33:15,493
.. a woman's place is at her husband's feet.

1050
01:33:15,650 --> 01:33:19,233
Honey, you should know it. - I see.

1051
01:33:19,733 --> 01:33:25,066
Mother.. Mother..

1052
01:33:25,566 --> 01:33:26,983
These two can be such children.

1053
01:33:27,483 --> 01:33:30,816
They spend half their time fighting.
The other half making up.

1054
01:33:31,316 --> 01:33:34,275
Sweetie-pie, can't you stay a while longer?

1055
01:33:34,775 --> 01:33:37,733
No, I have to go..

1056
01:33:38,233 --> 01:33:44,066
Sweetie - Pie! Sweetie - Pie! - Shut up guys.

1057
01:33:44,566 --> 01:33:48,816
"Don't go dear leaving me behind..

1058
01:33:49,316 --> 01:33:53,816
..I swear I will cry.. " - Shut up yaar..

1059
01:33:54,316 --> 01:33:56,900
I know how Sonia must be feeling right now..

1060
01:33:57,400 --> 01:33:59,025
.. my father was also in the army.

1061
01:33:59,525 --> 01:34:02,066
I used to think that way too..

1062
01:34:02,566 --> 01:34:05,327
When Ajay's father and I first got
married an Air-force pilot's wife.

1063
01:34:05,775 --> 01:34:08,775
You realize that..

1064
01:34:09,275 --> 01:34:15,150
..your husband has pledged
his life for the country.

1065
01:34:15,650 --> 01:34:19,150
Whether you like it or not you have to accept it.

1066
01:34:29,275 --> 01:34:34,608
I'm so happy Ajay's chosen a girl like you..

1067
01:34:35,108 --> 01:34:37,525
.. now I can die in peace.
- Don't talk nonsense Ma.

1068
01:34:38,025 --> 01:34:42,233
You'll have many more years..
And a dozen grandchildren too.

1069
01:34:42,733 --> 01:34:44,573
Grandchildren? First you've got to stay home..

1070
01:34:44,608 --> 01:34:48,108
.. long enough to make them, dude.

1071
01:35:15,775 --> 01:35:22,566
"The bugle sounds, the enemy wakes.
The battle is upon us.. "

1072
01:35:23,066 --> 01:35:26,150
"And in our hearts, we feel the swell, of..

1073
01:35:26,650 --> 01:35:29,941
.. pride and steel and valour.. "

1074
01:35:30,441 --> 01:35:32,608
"For we will play the game of blood, if..

1075
01:35:33,108 --> 01:35:37,191
.. dark clouds shroud our land.. "

1076
01:35:37,691 --> 01:35:40,316
"Because this day, we walk with death..

1077
01:35:40,816 --> 01:35:43,441
.. and laugh at its pale spectre.. "

1078
01:35:43,941 --> 01:35:45,983
"We will not fear those cruel swords..

1079
01:35:46,483 --> 01:35:48,400
.. our courage is far sharper.. "

1080
01:35:48,900 --> 01:35:54,650
"We will not fear those cruel swords..

1081
01:35:55,150 --> 01:36:03,150
.. our courage is far sharper.. "

1082
01:36:03,691 --> 01:36:10,441
"We will not fear those cruel swords..

1083
01:36:10,941 --> 01:36:17,816
"For let them know, their cowardly deeds..

1084
01:36:18,316 --> 01:36:22,775
.. , just serve to stoke our fires.. "

1085
01:36:23,275 --> 01:36:27,816
"Because this day, we walk with death..

1086
01:36:28,316 --> 01:36:33,900
.. and laugh at its pale spectre.. "

1087
01:36:34,400 --> 01:36:38,775
"We bade farewell, to this day,
knowing it could be our last.. "

1088
01:36:39,275 --> 01:36:43,608
"We swore to play, with our lives,
never waver in our task.. "

1089
01:36:44,108 --> 01:36:46,191
"For we are but the last, few guests..

1090
01:36:46,691 --> 01:36:48,566
.. served at fate's great banquet.. "

1091
01:36:49,066 --> 01:36:51,025
"Because this day, we walk with death..

1092
01:36:51,525 --> 01:36:53,400
.. and laugh at its pale spectre.. "

1093
01:36:53,900 --> 01:36:56,420
"We cannot quell, the raging storm,
the spirit of revolution.. "

1094
01:36:56,483 --> 01:36:58,883
"For it now courses in our veins,
like lava truly molten.. "

1095
01:36:58,941 --> 01:37:03,441
"We will teach them, the twin
lessons, of fear and fortitude.. "

1096
01:37:03,941 --> 01:37:05,858
"Our goal cannot now hide for long..

1097
01:37:06,358 --> 01:37:08,191
.. when courage is our beacon."

1098
01:37:08,691 --> 01:37:10,691
"Because this day, we walk with death..

1099
01:37:11,191 --> 01:37:14,233
.. and laugh at its pale spectre.. "

1100
01:37:14,733 --> 01:37:17,150
"Because this day, we walk with death..

1101
01:37:17,350 --> 01:37:19,440
The entire country is in the
deep state of mourning..

1102
01:37:19,441 --> 01:37:21,233
.. because of the demise of Lala Lajpat Rai.

1103
01:37:21,733 --> 01:37:24,233
Just before dying he said, "Every
blow rendered on me is the..

1104
01:37:24,733 --> 01:37:32,108
.. is the nail imbedded in the
coffin of the British imperialism.

1105
01:37:32,608 --> 01:37:37,691
It was the calm before the storm.

1106
01:37:38,191 --> 01:37:41,233
We have to take drastic measures.

1107
01:37:41,733 --> 01:37:45,066
What drastic measures?

1108
01:37:45,566 --> 01:37:49,066
Kill him.

1109
01:38:09,858 --> 01:38:13,358
C'mon..

1110
01:38:37,608 --> 01:38:41,858
Bhagat run! Quick!

1111
01:38:42,358 --> 01:38:45,858
Hey go away from here. We don't
want to kill any Hindustani.

1112
01:39:04,191 --> 01:39:07,441
And the days that followed Azad, Bhagat Singh..

1113
01:39:07,941 --> 01:39:09,233
And the others went missing.

1114
01:39:09,733 --> 01:39:12,150
This was the period when they coined two words..

1115
01:39:12,650 --> 01:39:16,025
.. 'Inquilab Zindabad'

1116
01:39:16,325 --> 01:39:18,274
Inquilab Zindabad - "Long live the revolution".

1117
01:39:18,275 --> 01:39:19,941
Two words that became the slogan for..

1118
01:39:20,441 --> 01:39:23,941
.. the Indian freedom movement.

1119
01:39:27,983 --> 01:39:29,608
Great idea!

1120
01:39:30,108 --> 01:39:31,858
But Bhagat, escaping will be impossible.

1121
01:39:32,358 --> 01:39:36,441
Our main mission is to get caught.. not escape.

1122
01:39:36,941 --> 01:39:37,941
What?

1123
01:39:38,400 --> 01:39:40,000
If we get caught there will be a trial..

1124
01:39:40,191 --> 01:39:44,275
.. we'll get a chance to speak.

1125
01:39:44,775 --> 01:39:48,275
We'll be heard.

1126
01:39:52,400 --> 01:39:56,025
But if they catch us, they'll hang us for certain.

1127
01:39:56,525 --> 01:39:59,191
I know.

1128
01:39:59,691 --> 01:40:03,191
But it takes a loud noise to open deaf ears.

1129
01:40:10,150 --> 01:40:11,566
Long live the revolution!

1130
01:40:12,066 --> 01:40:14,025
They were only smoke bombs, intended to..

1131
01:40:14,525 --> 01:40:17,066
.. awaken England from her dreams.

1132
01:40:17,566 --> 01:40:21,066
And they had more than achieved their task.

1133
01:40:31,275 --> 01:40:39,275
"Feel the unrest sweep through the land.. "

1134
01:40:41,025 --> 01:40:49,025
"Feel the unrest. Feel the unrest."

1135
01:40:51,108 --> 01:40:59,108
"Feel the unrest. Feel the unrest."

1136
01:41:00,900 --> 01:41:02,900
"The embers, they are burning.. "

1137
01:41:03,400 --> 01:41:05,840
"The tide, it's turning. You can
feel the winds of change.. "

1138
01:41:05,900 --> 01:41:09,400
"Feel the unrest sweep through
the land Feel the unrest.. "

1139
01:41:21,316 --> 01:41:23,900
We are prisoners.. political prisoners..

1140
01:41:24,400 --> 01:41:27,275
.. we should be allowed books.. writing material..

1141
01:41:27,775 --> 01:41:30,566
.. and at least one daily newspaper.

1142
01:41:31,066 --> 01:41:34,566
We will not eat till then. The
hunger strike will continue.

1143
01:41:47,525 --> 01:41:54,191
The fast and the torture went
on for 114 days. 114 days!

1144
01:41:54,691 --> 01:41:56,571
Never before in the history of any revolution..

1145
01:41:57,025 --> 01:41:58,185
.. had anyone lasted so long.

1146
01:41:58,233 --> 01:42:04,650
In such inhumane conditions we
could crush these young boys..

1147
01:42:05,150 --> 01:42:07,191
.. but we could not crush their souls.

1148
01:42:07,691 --> 01:42:14,108
"Our words won't falter now,
We will speak our mind.. "

1149
01:42:14,608 --> 01:42:20,025
"We won't back down now. Our
dreams we won't leave behind.. "

1150
01:42:20,525 --> 01:42:24,025
"We won't let the storm die.
Injustice we will defy.. "

1151
01:42:37,191 --> 01:42:41,650
"You can feel it possess you now.
Feel it, your soul claim.. "

1152
01:42:42,150 --> 01:42:46,608
"You can feel it possess you now.
Feel it, your soul claim.. "

1153
01:42:47,108 --> 01:42:49,150
"Drink this spirit in one long swallow.

1154
01:42:49,650 --> 01:42:51,566
Feel it course through your veins.. "

1155
01:42:52,066 --> 01:42:56,483
"Let the celebrations begin now.
Feel your body sway.. "

1156
01:42:56,983 --> 01:43:01,733
"In every breath feel more alive.
To keep the storm at bay.. "

1157
01:43:02,233 --> 01:43:04,358
"See the unrest in those eyes.
See it all around.. "

1158
01:43:04,858 --> 01:43:11,858
"See it in the air, my friend.
And in those hearts, abound.. "

1159
01:43:12,358 --> 01:43:14,441
"See the unrest in those eyes.
See it all around.. "

1160
01:43:14,941 --> 01:43:18,441
"See it in the air, my friend.
And in those hearts, abound.. "

1161
01:43:32,025 --> 01:43:38,900
"We are engulfed in the shadows
But we will come out brighter.. "

1162
01:43:39,400 --> 01:43:41,525
"Feel the unrest. Feel the unrest.. "

1163
01:43:42,025 --> 01:43:48,775
"We are engulfed in the shadows.
But we will come out brighter.. "

1164
01:43:49,275 --> 01:43:51,483
"Feel the unrest. Feel the unrest.. "

1165
01:43:51,983 --> 01:43:59,983
"Feel the unrest. Feel the unrest.. "

1166
01:44:02,400 --> 01:44:05,900
"Injustice we will defy.. "

1167
01:44:09,358 --> 01:44:11,941
Pretty nice huh? Very pretty.

1168
01:44:12,441 --> 01:44:15,941
I like these ones, I think I'll buy them.

1169
01:44:19,816 --> 01:44:22,775
This is not an animal.

1170
01:44:23,275 --> 01:44:25,941
In breaking news today..

1171
01:44:26,441 --> 01:44:30,525
.. a MIG-21 fighter plane has just crashed..

1172
01:44:31,025 --> 01:44:33,733
.. this is the second such
crash in the past six months..

1173
01:44:34,233 --> 01:44:37,650
The Defence Ministry has ordered
an investigation into the crash.

1174
01:44:38,150 --> 01:44:41,191
We have just received news that the pilot..

1175
01:44:41,691 --> 01:44:46,275
.. Flight Lieutenant Ajay
Rathod has died in the crash.

1176
01:44:46,775 --> 01:44:49,941
Flight Lt Rathod apparently did not
eject from the burning plane..

1177
01:44:50,441 --> 01:44:54,191
Instead he steered it and
crashed it in an open field.

1178
01:44:54,691 --> 01:44:58,233
Thus saving many lives

1179
01:44:58,733 --> 01:45:00,816
Viewers may recall..

1180
01:45:01,316 --> 01:45:04,483
.. that until now, 163
MiG-21 of IAF have crashed..

1181
01:45:04,983 --> 01:45:08,483
.. and 66 pilots have lost their lives.

1182
01:46:24,358 --> 01:46:28,316
"This game of hide and seek has gone on too long..

1183
01:46:28,816 --> 01:46:33,108
.. come home now, won't you."

1184
01:46:33,608 --> 01:46:37,608
"I've searched high and low."

1185
01:46:38,108 --> 01:46:44,108
"These old eyes are weary so,
come home now won't you.. "

1186
01:46:44,608 --> 01:46:48,608
"Dusk is spreading like the ache in my heart..

1187
01:46:49,108 --> 01:46:56,733
.. my vision blurs, come home now won't you."

1188
01:46:57,233 --> 01:47:05,233
"I'm in a place you wouldn't believe Ma."

1189
01:47:06,358 --> 01:47:14,358
"Endless skies I can soar."

1190
01:47:15,650 --> 01:47:19,691
"Just like your fairy tales,
it's filled with dreams."

1191
01:47:20,191 --> 01:47:23,983
"A sea of hope with no shore."

1192
01:47:24,483 --> 01:47:32,483
"My soul flies here, like a kite without fear.

1193
01:47:33,483 --> 01:47:41,358
No one to cut my strings, no more."

1194
01:47:41,858 --> 01:47:47,066
Flt. Lt. Ajay Rathod stayed in
the plane until the very end..

1195
01:47:47,566 --> 01:47:51,691
.. and steered the plane clear of Ambala city.

1196
01:47:52,191 --> 01:47:58,983
Thereby saving many lives. But Lt. Rathod

1197
01:47:59,483 --> 01:48:01,275
.. had to give away his life.

1198
01:48:01,775 --> 01:48:03,316
In the last 10 years over 100 MIG-21..

1199
01:48:03,816 --> 01:48:05,336
.. aircrafts of the IAF have crashed..

1200
01:48:05,650 --> 01:48:09,608
.. in which over 30 pilots have lost their lives.

1201
01:48:10,108 --> 01:48:11,900
Defence Minister Shastri, the CAG report..

1202
01:48:12,400 --> 01:48:13,760
.. states that old and defective..

1203
01:48:13,816 --> 01:48:17,233
.. Russian spare parts were
procured by the government.

1204
01:48:17,733 --> 01:48:20,775
Isn't this a case of high-level corruption?

1205
01:48:21,275 --> 01:48:23,150
Not at all. I've personally clarified..

1206
01:48:23,650 --> 01:48:26,733
.. the issue in the parliament.

1207
01:48:27,233 --> 01:48:28,775
This is a downright lie.

1208
01:48:29,275 --> 01:48:30,835
The youngsters of today are brash and..

1209
01:48:30,891 --> 01:48:32,524
.. irresponsible when it comes to flying planes.

1210
01:48:32,525 --> 01:48:34,400
No! I don't agree..

1211
01:48:34,900 --> 01:48:37,025
Flt. Lt. Ajay Rathod was an ace pilot..

1212
01:48:37,525 --> 01:48:39,233
.. who I trained..

1213
01:48:39,733 --> 01:48:43,400
He was a gold medalist. The
youngest to clear night sorties.

1214
01:48:43,900 --> 01:48:46,400
With over 1000 flying hours..

1215
01:48:46,900 --> 01:48:49,358
This can't be the record
of an irresponsible pilot.

1216
01:48:49,858 --> 01:48:52,400
Defence Minister, how many more pilots..

1217
01:48:52,900 --> 01:48:55,441
.. will you send to their graves..

1218
01:48:55,941 --> 01:48:57,858
.. before you stop the rot in the system?

1219
01:48:58,358 --> 01:48:59,983
Will all our boys die the same way?

1220
01:49:00,483 --> 01:49:03,483
We are talking about the one..

1221
01:49:03,983 --> 01:49:11,983
"If only I could show you this place, Ma."

1222
01:49:13,066 --> 01:49:21,066
"Here waterfalls are made of rainbows."

1223
01:49:22,358 --> 01:49:26,483
"There are no roses just bouquets of dreams Ma."

1224
01:49:26,983 --> 01:49:30,983
"Their scent, no flower can hope for."

1225
01:49:31,483 --> 01:49:35,775
"Here sunlight and shadow walk hand in hand."

1226
01:49:36,275 --> 01:49:40,358
"Everything seems bright and new."

1227
01:49:40,858 --> 01:49:44,983
"But what is heaven, and all its wonders,

1228
01:49:45,483 --> 01:49:50,566
.. when Ma, I don't have you."

1229
01:49:51,066 --> 01:49:53,983
From now on, the government will make sure that..

1230
01:49:54,483 --> 01:49:59,525
.. only experienced pilots are
given access to these machines..

1231
01:50:00,025 --> 01:50:06,066
.. and not to rash pilots like Ajay Rathod.

1232
01:50:06,566 --> 01:50:08,066
What the hell is he talking about!

1233
01:50:08,566 --> 01:50:12,066
I welcome any investigation.
I have nothing to hide.

1234
01:50:17,108 --> 01:50:21,275
This damn MIG investigation
shouldn't take us down.

1235
01:50:21,775 --> 01:50:28,775
Relax Sir. Public memory is short.
Besides, we'll handle things.

1236
01:50:29,275 --> 01:50:34,483
Dead pilots, live very long in the news.

1237
01:50:34,983 --> 01:50:38,483
But then, they join the forces to
sacrifice their lives. Don't they?

1238
01:51:46,775 --> 01:51:48,983
The situation is tense at the moment.

1239
01:51:49,483 --> 01:51:51,650
There is growing anger and discontent.

1240
01:51:51,950 --> 01:51:53,649
Directed largely towards the government..

1241
01:51:53,650 --> 01:51:56,025
.. especially the Defence Minister.

1242
01:51:56,525 --> 01:52:00,025
We have with us Ajay Rathod's mother..

1243
01:52:02,316 --> 01:52:05,108
The government can't wash its
hand off the issue like this.

1244
01:52:05,608 --> 01:52:08,191
They are answerable to the public.

1245
01:52:08,691 --> 01:52:11,066
If the MIG spare parts were of doubtful quality..

1246
01:52:11,566 --> 01:52:18,191
.. why were they bought in the first place?

1247
01:52:18,691 --> 01:52:22,400
MIG's can be made again.. But our children..

1248
01:52:22,900 --> 01:52:26,941
.. cannot be brought back..

1249
01:52:27,441 --> 01:52:31,858
It is very clear, the Defence
Minister is morally responsible.

1250
01:52:32,358 --> 01:52:33,775
He has to resign.

1251
01:52:34,275 --> 01:52:37,650
It looks like the veil has been
pulled off the Defence scam.

1252
01:52:38,150 --> 01:52:41,025
But how much will be revealed?

1253
01:52:41,525 --> 01:52:47,441
Mishra, what's happening?

1254
01:52:47,941 --> 01:52:51,441
Our Defence minister says that
Ajay Rathod was a novice but..

1255
01:53:01,608 --> 01:53:04,275
.. he didn't let his plane crash into the town.

1256
01:53:04,775 --> 01:53:11,941
When it developed a snag he
didn't try to save his life.

1257
01:53:12,441 --> 01:53:15,650
He didn't try to save his life.

1258
01:53:16,150 --> 01:53:22,150
He steered it clear of Ambala..
Saving thousands of civilians.

1259
01:53:22,650 --> 01:53:29,191
Yet the Defence Minister calls him rash.

1260
01:53:29,691 --> 01:53:33,525
We want to ask a question that
how many of the minister's..

1261
01:53:34,025 --> 01:53:37,525
.. children's are in army.

1262
01:53:48,025 --> 01:53:52,275
I'm not moving.. this is for Ajay.

1263
01:53:52,775 --> 01:53:54,441
This could turn ugly Aunty.

1264
01:53:54,941 --> 01:53:58,441
Let it.

1265
01:54:20,441 --> 01:54:24,733
"Our blood is raging. It's
flowing through the streets."..

1266
01:54:25,233 --> 01:54:27,775
.. "But it won't go in vain"

1267
01:54:28,275 --> 01:54:35,858
"Our eyes are blood shot for a purpose.
A cause we will attain."

1268
01:54:36,358 --> 01:54:43,566
"It fell from our bodies, embraced the earth."

1269
01:54:44,066 --> 01:54:48,858
"Went winding through streets. A river of courage"

1270
01:54:49,358 --> 01:54:53,358
"It surged and swept."

1271
01:54:53,858 --> 01:54:57,358
"It flowed to make a new
beginning" "Our blood raging.. "

1272
01:55:15,733 --> 01:55:23,400
"From gaping wounds, and gashes large,"

1273
01:55:23,900 --> 01:55:30,775
"It oozed, slowly and steadily."

1274
01:55:31,275 --> 01:55:38,983
"While the pointing fingers, got fists in reply,"

1275
01:55:39,483 --> 01:55:47,483
"Yet, our blood was raging"

1276
01:55:48,900 --> 01:55:56,400
"It flowed not in vain but with a purpose."

1277
01:55:56,900 --> 01:56:04,441
"Our eyes are blood shot for a purpose."

1278
01:56:04,941 --> 01:56:12,191
"It fell from our bodies, embraced the earth."

1279
01:56:12,691 --> 01:56:17,525
"Our blood is ranging. It's
flowing through the streets."

1280
01:56:18,025 --> 01:56:21,900
"It surged and swept."

1281
01:56:22,400 --> 01:56:26,775
"It flowed to make a new beginning"

1282
01:56:27,275 --> 01:56:32,358
"Yet, our blood was raging."

1283
01:56:32,858 --> 01:56:36,316
"Yet, our blood was raging."

1284
01:56:36,816 --> 01:56:40,233
"Yet, our blood was raging."

1285
01:56:40,733 --> 01:56:44,191
"Yet, our blood was raging."

1286
01:56:44,691 --> 01:56:48,150
"Yet, our blood was raging."

1287
01:56:48,650 --> 01:56:52,025
"Yet, our blood was raging."

1288
01:56:52,525 --> 01:56:56,025
"Yet, our blood was raging."

1289
01:57:12,275 --> 01:57:13,635
Someone get a doctor! Immediately!

1290
01:57:13,675 --> 01:57:15,190
Take her to emergency ward. - Yes doctor.

1291
01:57:15,191 --> 01:57:18,150
Fast.

1292
01:57:18,650 --> 01:57:22,150
Please stay here. I'll take
care of patient. Please.

1293
01:57:28,608 --> 01:57:32,108
Greetings!

1294
01:57:42,483 --> 01:57:46,441
They were beating up innocent people..

1295
01:57:46,941 --> 01:57:49,066
Why didn't you stop them?

1296
01:57:49,566 --> 01:57:51,686
You protested against the
government, our own party..

1297
01:57:51,775 --> 01:57:53,335
The protest was not against the party..

1298
01:57:53,608 --> 01:57:55,691
The protest was not against the party..

1299
01:57:56,191 --> 01:57:59,441
.. it was for the truth.

1300
01:57:59,941 --> 01:58:02,608
So many pilots have died..

1301
01:58:02,808 --> 01:58:05,091
.. young boys who were fighting
for our country.. killed..

1302
01:58:05,191 --> 01:58:10,483
.. so that someone in the
government could make money.

1303
01:58:10,983 --> 01:58:13,775
And our party office doesn't do a thing about it.

1304
01:58:14,275 --> 01:58:17,775
Come.. Sit down.

1305
01:58:20,525 --> 01:58:24,025
Have some tea.

1306
01:58:27,983 --> 01:58:31,191
Don't be so emotional.

1307
01:58:31,691 --> 01:58:34,983
In politics there's no place for emotions.

1308
01:58:35,483 --> 01:58:38,233
We have big plans for you.

1309
01:58:38,733 --> 01:58:40,893
You have to go further.
- I don't want to go anywhere.

1310
01:58:41,150 --> 01:58:46,525
Only dogs salivate when you
show them bone Mishraji.

1311
01:58:47,025 --> 01:58:52,858
Beat him.. Beat him..

1312
01:58:53,358 --> 01:58:56,858
Beat him.. Beat him..

1313
01:59:16,941 --> 01:59:18,233
How's Aunty?

1314
01:59:18,733 --> 01:59:22,233
They're doing an MRI. We are waiting.

1315
01:59:39,150 --> 01:59:41,441
I am sorry, she's slipped into a coma.

1316
01:59:41,941 --> 01:59:47,608
Severe skull damage, coupled with
the shock of her son's death.

1317
01:59:48,108 --> 01:59:51,941
That's an ugly gash. You need attention.

1318
01:59:52,441 --> 01:59:53,641
Nothing will happen to mother.

1319
01:59:53,733 --> 01:59:56,358
If you need anything, I am there.

1320
01:59:56,858 --> 02:00:00,358
Aslam.. How's he?

1321
02:00:03,566 --> 02:00:07,066
What have you come for? Haven't
you done enough damage?

1322
02:00:10,150 --> 02:00:12,900
Uncle, it isn't what you think.

1323
02:00:13,400 --> 02:00:19,400
I'm not interested in what you
think and what you want to do..

1324
02:00:19,900 --> 02:00:21,775
I'm just going to say this once.

1325
02:00:22,275 --> 02:00:24,775
Aslam doesn't know what is good or bad for him.

1326
02:00:24,875 --> 02:00:26,482
He's an emotional boy, always has been.

1327
02:00:26,483 --> 02:00:29,358
He listens to his heart, not his head.

1328
02:00:29,858 --> 02:00:32,858
These are bad times, for people like us.

1329
02:00:33,358 --> 02:00:38,525
Don't take him down with you.

1330
02:00:39,025 --> 02:00:42,525
Go on.. He's inside.

1331
02:00:58,441 --> 02:01:00,775
Guddu, go out.

1332
02:01:01,275 --> 02:01:04,400
All parts working?

1333
02:01:04,900 --> 02:01:08,650
Don't make me laugh, idiot. It hurts

1334
02:01:09,150 --> 02:01:11,025
How's aunty?

1335
02:01:11,525 --> 02:01:15,733
She's in a coma. - Oh God!

1336
02:01:16,233 --> 02:01:19,733
How can this be happening to us?

1337
02:01:30,941 --> 02:01:32,108
Some dinner?

1338
02:01:32,608 --> 02:01:35,400
No, don't worry Aunty.

1339
02:01:35,900 --> 02:01:37,400
We just came to see Aslam.

1340
02:01:37,900 --> 02:01:39,566
We've got to get back to the hospital.

1341
02:01:40,066 --> 02:01:42,316
Take care.

1342
02:01:42,816 --> 02:01:45,816
See you. Take care.

1343
02:01:46,316 --> 02:01:49,816
Take care.

1344
02:02:05,650 --> 02:02:09,983
Listen.. I..

1345
02:02:10,483 --> 02:02:13,983
I always.. I'm sorry.

1346
02:03:17,858 --> 02:03:21,358
Please eat.

1347
02:03:41,941 --> 02:03:46,150
Everything's falling apart..

1348
02:03:46,650 --> 02:03:50,150
.. and all I can do is stand and watch.

1349
02:03:55,650 --> 02:03:59,150
People like us don't count out here.

1350
02:04:03,233 --> 02:04:09,691
A hundred more Ajay's can die
and nothing will change.

1351
02:04:10,191 --> 02:04:13,691
..and nothing will change.

1352
02:04:41,691 --> 02:04:45,191
Ajay did everything right, all his life.. yet..

1353
02:04:49,400 --> 02:04:56,733
.. he was a good pilot, a
good friend, a good son..

1354
02:04:57,233 --> 02:05:03,316
.. he never harmed a soul,
he never did anything wrong.

1355
02:05:03,816 --> 02:05:08,775
.. he didn't deserve this..
Everything is over suddenly.

1356
02:05:09,275 --> 02:05:12,775
.. Sonia didn't deserve this..

1357
02:05:26,108 --> 02:05:31,233
As I watched DJ sleep that night
a funny thought occurred to me..

1358
02:05:31,733 --> 02:05:34,025
.. may be DJ wasn't sleeping.

1359
02:05:34,525 --> 02:05:38,025
May be none of them were. May
be they were all waking up.

1360
02:06:19,150 --> 02:06:23,441
Hey Karan.. they've spoilt your jacket.

1361
02:06:23,941 --> 02:06:27,441
Long live India!

1362
02:06:57,441 --> 02:07:00,525
The bastard got away with it again.

1363
02:07:01,025 --> 02:07:03,566
What can we do..

1364
02:07:04,066 --> 02:07:08,525
..when the law of the land protects
people like the Defence Minister.

1365
02:07:09,025 --> 02:07:12,566
We have to take drastic measures.

1366
02:07:13,066 --> 02:07:14,900
What drastic measures?

1367
02:07:15,400 --> 02:07:19,858
What do you want to do?

1368
02:07:20,358 --> 02:07:23,441
Kill him.

1369
02:07:23,941 --> 02:07:25,275
What?

1370
02:07:25,775 --> 02:07:29,900
Kill the Defence Minister!
Have you lost your mind?

1371
02:07:30,400 --> 02:07:31,733
We aren't killers Sonia.

1372
02:07:32,233 --> 02:07:33,441
But they are.

1373
02:07:33,941 --> 02:07:35,066
Have you lost it Karan!

1374
02:07:35,566 --> 02:07:38,025
It's not a blood lust..

1375
02:07:38,525 --> 02:07:39,645
.. it's a matter of justice.

1376
02:07:39,941 --> 02:07:41,108
I'll get the gun.

1377
02:07:41,608 --> 02:07:43,733
Don't instigate, Pandey. We can't start killing..

1378
02:07:44,233 --> 02:07:46,525
.. people for any small reason.

1379
02:07:47,025 --> 02:07:49,983
You think Ajay's death is a small reason?
- Karan, Karan.

1380
02:07:50,483 --> 02:07:51,900
Ajay's mother is a small reason?

1381
02:07:52,400 --> 02:07:55,191
It is not the matter. Understand me.

1382
02:07:55,691 --> 02:07:57,691
Lala Lajpat Rai's death has to be avenged.

1383
02:07:58,191 --> 02:07:59,441
Scott has to be killed.

1384
02:07:59,941 --> 02:08:03,441
But..

1385
02:08:10,150 --> 02:08:15,441
I always thought we didn't believe in anything.

1386
02:08:15,941 --> 02:08:19,441
So did I. Until now.

1387
02:08:29,816 --> 02:08:30,983
You're insane.

1388
02:08:31,483 --> 02:08:34,983
We can get him in the morning while he jogs.

1389
02:08:38,358 --> 02:08:42,358
Who's we, huh? Who's going to pull the trigger?

1390
02:08:42,858 --> 02:08:46,525
I'll do it!

1391
02:08:47,025 --> 02:08:48,858
There's less security in the morning.

1392
02:08:49,358 --> 02:08:51,150
There's a chance of getting caught.

1393
02:08:51,650 --> 02:08:55,150
No matter what we'll have to take this chance.

1394
02:09:41,483 --> 02:09:43,323
The Defence Minister was on his morning walk..

1395
02:09:43,608 --> 02:09:45,483
.. at 07:58AM with two body guards..

1396
02:09:45,983 --> 02:09:47,703
..when two unidentified gunmen opened fire.

1397
02:09:47,741 --> 02:09:49,482
He was hit by 3 bullets in his chest, and..

1398
02:09:49,483 --> 02:09:52,983
.. was declared dead on reaching hospital.

1399
02:10:04,900 --> 02:10:06,620
Government spokesmen believe that this is..

1400
02:10:06,900 --> 02:10:11,066
.. an attempt to destablise the govt.

1401
02:10:11,566 --> 02:10:14,400
The country has lost a great leader because..

1402
02:10:14,900 --> 02:10:16,941
.. of the cowardly act of some terrorists.

1403
02:10:17,441 --> 02:10:19,441
He was a true soldier, a true patriot..

1404
02:10:19,941 --> 02:10:22,733
.. who sacrificed his life for the country.

1405
02:10:23,233 --> 02:10:28,441
His contribution to the country
cannot be described in words.

1406
02:10:28,941 --> 02:10:31,441
Sukhi!

1407
02:10:31,841 --> 02:10:33,440
Meanwhile our sources have discovered..

1408
02:10:33,441 --> 02:10:34,983
.. a telephonic conversation..

1409
02:10:35,183 --> 02:10:37,107
.. between the Late Defence Minister Shastri..

1410
02:10:37,108 --> 02:10:39,108
.. This conversation took place just a few..

1411
02:10:39,608 --> 02:10:43,066
.. days before the Defence Minister's murder.

1412
02:10:43,566 --> 02:10:45,400
Sir, nothing to worry, the Russians want..

1413
02:10:45,900 --> 02:10:47,140
.. us to reduce our commission.

1414
02:10:47,358 --> 02:10:51,608
Didn't you tell them it's not a
defence deal, first it is our deal.

1415
02:10:52,108 --> 02:10:55,275
That's why I was also adamant,
this is the deal, if you want..

1416
02:10:55,775 --> 02:10:59,275
Let's go.

1417
02:11:04,275 --> 02:11:07,775
Come on.

1418
02:11:08,691 --> 02:11:15,400
V.K. Shastri was killed by
two unidentified persons.

1419
02:11:15,900 --> 02:11:16,900
Paaji, where's DJ?

1420
02:11:17,400 --> 02:11:20,900
They were just here.

1421
02:11:24,733 --> 02:11:28,233
He hasn't come home all night.

1422
02:11:30,025 --> 02:11:33,191
Is everything alright? - Yes.

1423
02:11:33,691 --> 02:11:37,191
He said he'd be spending the night at DJ's.
- Thank you.

1424
02:11:50,900 --> 02:11:55,150
Have you seen DJ?

1425
02:11:55,650 --> 02:11:57,525
Is everything alright?

1426
02:11:58,025 --> 02:12:04,275
I can't find them or Sonia..
I don't know where they are.

1427
02:12:04,775 --> 02:12:11,233
Come with me.. Sit, sit.

1428
02:12:11,733 --> 02:12:15,858
Don't worry.. nothing will happen to these boys..
- But DJ..

1429
02:12:16,358 --> 02:12:18,441
Daljeet has always been a brat..

1430
02:12:18,941 --> 02:12:21,816
.. he used to disappear on his bike for days..

1431
02:12:22,316 --> 02:12:24,441
He used disappear for the whole night.

1432
02:12:24,941 --> 02:12:27,108
He is my only son, if it had been two to four..

1433
02:12:27,608 --> 02:12:30,108
.. I would have slept easily.

1434
02:12:30,608 --> 02:12:32,150
I'm scared..

1435
02:12:32,650 --> 02:12:35,191
Don't be afraid..

1436
02:12:35,691 --> 02:12:39,025
God will take care of everything..

1437
02:12:39,525 --> 02:12:43,025
God watches over the people we love.

1438
02:12:56,316 --> 02:12:59,275
Defence Minister.. the martyr..

1439
02:12:59,775 --> 02:13:07,775
.. one of India's favourite sons.. Bastard!

1440
02:13:08,275 --> 02:13:11,191
Read it. they're honoring
him with the Bharat Ratna.

1441
02:13:11,691 --> 02:13:16,108
All our efforts, wasted.

1442
02:13:16,608 --> 02:13:18,191
People need to know the truth.

1443
02:13:18,691 --> 02:13:20,608
Sure..

1444
02:13:21,108 --> 02:13:23,650
We and have to surrender ourselves for it.

1445
02:13:24,150 --> 02:13:25,483
What?

1446
02:13:25,983 --> 02:13:30,400
Terrific! You want us to walk right..

1447
02:13:30,900 --> 02:13:34,858
..in and give ourselves up!

1448
02:13:35,358 --> 02:13:36,638
And whom should we surrender to?

1449
02:13:36,900 --> 02:13:39,066
The police are mere puppets.

1450
02:13:39,566 --> 02:13:41,441
So what should we do? Should we just sit back?

1451
02:13:41,941 --> 02:13:45,233
Let them say anything. - No! Let's kill them all!

1452
02:13:45,733 --> 02:13:47,691
Right Pandey? Bang! Bang! Bang!

1453
02:13:48,191 --> 02:13:51,691
Someone make him shut up!

1454
02:13:58,858 --> 02:14:02,066
You always knew that your father was in it.

1455
02:14:02,566 --> 02:14:06,483
You knew everything.

1456
02:14:06,983 --> 02:14:09,941
No I didn't know, Sukhi.. - Sukhi is dead..

1457
02:14:10,441 --> 02:14:11,483
You're lying!

1458
02:14:11,983 --> 02:14:13,943
You always wanted to take revenge on your father.

1459
02:14:14,275 --> 02:14:17,650
Sukhi, shut up! - I won't shut up.

1460
02:14:18,150 --> 02:14:21,733
Who am I to say anything?
This Karan is only yours.

1461
02:14:22,233 --> 02:14:27,150
Hey Sukhi. - DJ he's used you.. - Shut up Sukhi.

1462
02:14:27,650 --> 02:14:29,775
.. he's used all of us, all of us.

1463
02:14:30,275 --> 02:14:34,816
Mark my words, he will be safe,
his father will bail him out.

1464
02:14:35,316 --> 02:14:39,358
But we'll get caught. And I don't want to die DJ..
- Sukhi.

1465
02:14:39,858 --> 02:14:43,358
I don't want to die.

1466
02:14:47,525 --> 02:14:51,025
We did all this for Ajay.

1467
02:14:54,108 --> 02:14:57,608
What will happen now DJ?

1468
02:15:04,066 --> 02:15:07,900
You've decided? - Yes.

1469
02:15:08,400 --> 02:15:12,900
I need to know the truth.. don't worry.

1470
02:15:13,400 --> 02:15:16,858
I'm not worried. Just don't be late.

1471
02:15:17,358 --> 02:15:20,119
The night is still young and the
show's name is 'Raat Baki Baat Baki'

1472
02:15:20,483 --> 02:15:22,083
.. and I am Rahul, let's rock the party.

1473
02:15:22,483 --> 02:15:24,858
There's great DJ remixes coming up.

1474
02:15:25,358 --> 02:15:28,858
Nowadays new songs don't work old songs are..

1475
02:15:32,441 --> 02:15:34,191
Nothing will happen to you Karan.

1476
02:15:34,691 --> 02:15:36,566
That's a promise, nothing will happen to you.

1477
02:15:37,066 --> 02:15:40,441
Just give me the names of the others.

1478
02:15:40,941 --> 02:15:42,441
I have good contacts.

1479
02:15:42,641 --> 02:15:45,107
I'll get you the best lawyers,
pull all the strings possible.

1480
02:15:45,108 --> 02:15:47,191
But I will get you out from it.

1481
02:15:47,691 --> 02:15:51,566
You just have to say that
you were forced into it..

1482
02:15:52,066 --> 02:15:53,066
.. do you understand ?

1483
02:15:53,233 --> 02:15:56,941
And then you are out of this country.

1484
02:15:57,441 --> 02:16:00,691
Say something. Do you get me?

1485
02:16:01,191 --> 02:16:03,858
Say something Damn it, Your father's reputation..

1486
02:16:04,358 --> 02:16:06,025
..his life's work is at stake.

1487
02:16:06,525 --> 02:16:11,441
Why did you do it? Why did you do it?

1488
02:16:11,941 --> 02:16:12,941
Why did you do it, Dad?

1489
02:16:13,316 --> 02:16:16,400
I.. What did I do?

1490
02:16:16,900 --> 02:16:19,191
These people don't fear death.

1491
02:16:19,691 --> 02:16:21,900
Ajay used to say..

1492
02:16:22,400 --> 02:16:27,358
..let death come.. anything for the country.

1493
02:16:27,858 --> 02:16:32,858
Ajay..

1494
02:16:33,358 --> 02:16:38,400
You'll handle it, out of the country.

1495
02:16:38,900 --> 02:16:44,400
Ajay was burnt alive.. not for the country.

1496
02:16:44,900 --> 02:16:46,983
You killed him!

1497
02:16:47,483 --> 02:16:49,608
You made him a joke..

1498
02:16:50,108 --> 02:16:52,650
I know you're very disturbed.

1499
02:16:53,150 --> 02:16:55,191
What has happened has happened.

1500
02:16:55,691 --> 02:16:58,691
Relax! Let me handle things.

1501
02:16:59,191 --> 02:17:02,441
I'll find a way out.

1502
02:17:02,941 --> 02:17:04,275
Really Dad? Is there a way out?

1503
02:17:04,775 --> 02:17:08,275
Of course. There are many ways.

1504
02:17:11,066 --> 02:17:14,566
Yes we'll go away from this country tonight.

1505
02:18:14,941 --> 02:18:19,025
You don't have to do this..

1506
02:18:19,525 --> 02:18:22,358
I want to.

1507
02:18:22,858 --> 02:18:27,733
Sukhi, this might end badly.

1508
02:18:28,233 --> 02:18:34,025
Without you guys it will end for me anyway..

1509
02:18:34,525 --> 02:18:38,025
Idiot. Come.

1510
02:18:46,941 --> 02:18:50,441
Ajay passed away. But his
death won't go in vain, ma.

1511
02:18:58,400 --> 02:19:04,316
What is it about these boys
that make them have no fear?

1512
02:19:04,816 --> 02:19:07,566
I think some times a person can be pushed so..

1513
02:19:08,066 --> 02:19:13,733
.. far that they reach a place beyond fear.

1514
02:19:14,233 --> 02:19:17,775
A place where we find a strange peace where you..

1515
02:19:18,275 --> 02:19:23,816
.. free yourselves to do the right thing.

1516
02:19:24,316 --> 02:19:29,483
And sometimes that's the hardest thing to do.

1517
02:19:29,983 --> 02:19:31,503
Welcome back to Raat Baaki Baat Baaki.

1518
02:19:31,900 --> 02:19:34,733
This is Rahul, and you've tuned
in to your favourite radio show..

1519
02:19:35,233 --> 02:19:38,733
.. let's listen to R.D. Burman's romantic music.

1520
02:20:58,191 --> 02:21:01,566
Hey Karan! What a surprise!
What're you doing here?

1521
02:21:02,066 --> 02:21:04,316
We need a favour. - Sure!

1522
02:21:04,816 --> 02:21:05,936
I need you to put us on air.

1523
02:21:06,358 --> 02:21:10,775
I didn't understand. Put you on air?

1524
02:21:11,275 --> 02:21:12,816
Yeah, now! Live.

1525
02:21:13,316 --> 02:21:15,941
I want to go on air. Live.
Is it some kind of a joke?

1526
02:21:16,441 --> 02:21:19,316
That's impossible man.. I'll lose my job.

1527
02:21:19,816 --> 02:21:22,233
It's payback time.

1528
02:21:22,733 --> 02:21:27,858
Hey! It's your station. Unreal man!

1529
02:21:28,358 --> 02:21:30,358
Gun.. He's got a gun!

1530
02:21:30,858 --> 02:21:33,650
Karan you go in. I'll handle it.

1531
02:21:34,150 --> 02:21:42,150
Keep the show on. Don't mess with us.

1532
02:21:42,941 --> 02:21:48,233
Come on.. leave, don't worry, nothing will happen.

1533
02:21:48,733 --> 02:21:51,983
Paaji is anyone inside?

1534
02:21:52,483 --> 02:21:56,733
Uncle-ji run. Don't stop.

1535
02:21:57,233 --> 02:22:02,650
Gun.. Security he's got a gun!

1536
02:22:03,150 --> 02:22:04,733
Don't be a wise guy.

1537
02:22:05,233 --> 02:22:07,733
Everybody leave! Out! Move!

1538
02:22:08,233 --> 02:22:11,316
Everybody leave! Out! Move!

1539
02:22:11,816 --> 02:22:15,233
Don't panic we won't harm anyone.

1540
02:22:15,733 --> 02:22:18,483
Move! Move! Move! Nothing will happen.

1541
02:22:18,983 --> 02:22:24,107
Move, Nothing will happen to you.

1542
02:22:24,108 --> 02:22:26,074
Nothing will happen to you, don't worry, move..

1543
02:22:26,275 --> 02:22:29,275
Hurry up, quick! Till downstairs.

1544
02:22:46,150 --> 02:22:48,233
The time is 6:05 a.m. My name is Rahul..

1545
02:22:48,733 --> 02:22:52,150
.. And you're listening to
"The night is still young".

1546
02:22:52,650 --> 02:22:55,441
Today I've got a surprise guest for you.

1547
02:22:55,941 --> 02:22:58,108
An old friend of mine Karan Singhania who just..

1548
02:22:58,608 --> 02:23:02,108
.. dropped in to say something to all of you..

1549
02:23:08,316 --> 02:23:12,025
My name is Karan Singhania.. My friends and I..

1550
02:23:12,525 --> 02:23:15,691
.. we killed the Defence Minister Shastri..

1551
02:23:16,191 --> 02:23:20,191
I repeat we killed the Defence Minister..

1552
02:23:20,691 --> 02:23:23,858
Ravi take me to the radio
station quickly. Hurry up!

1553
02:23:24,358 --> 02:23:29,983
We are not terrorists. We aren't
backed by any foreign organisation.

1554
02:23:30,483 --> 02:23:33,441
We don't even belong to any political group..

1555
02:23:33,941 --> 02:23:36,525
We're just five students from Delhi University.

1556
02:23:37,025 --> 02:23:40,025
We killed the Defense Minister
because he murdered..

1557
02:23:40,525 --> 02:23:45,066
.. our friend Flight Lieutenant Ajay Rathod..

1558
02:23:45,566 --> 02:23:48,691
.. and many other Air Force pilots..

1559
02:23:49,191 --> 02:23:51,608
We killed him because after he murdered Ajay,

1560
02:23:52,108 --> 02:23:54,608
.. he murdered his name..

1561
02:23:55,108 --> 02:23:58,108
Ajay's mother who not only sacrificed him..

1562
02:23:58,608 --> 02:24:01,191
.. but also her husband..

1563
02:24:01,691 --> 02:24:08,400
.. right now, is fighting for her life..

1564
02:24:08,900 --> 02:24:14,358
A Defence Minister is supposed to
safegaurd a nation. Not sell it.

1565
02:24:14,858 --> 02:24:17,775
Who will stop them? Law.

1566
02:24:17,975 --> 02:24:19,774
Men like the Defence Minister aren't just..

1567
02:24:19,775 --> 02:24:21,775
.. above the law.. they control it.

1568
02:24:22,275 --> 02:24:24,691
We killed the Defence Minister because..

1569
02:24:25,191 --> 02:24:27,400
.. he was roaming scot-free..

1570
02:24:27,900 --> 02:24:30,733
.. even after committing such a big crime.

1571
02:24:31,233 --> 02:24:36,441
What we have done is wrong, may be it's a crime.

1572
02:24:36,941 --> 02:24:42,816
But we could not see all this.
We have come here to surrender.

1573
02:24:43,316 --> 02:24:44,900
We have come here to tell everyone..

1574
02:24:45,400 --> 02:24:48,233
.. that we must do something.

1575
02:24:48,733 --> 02:24:53,900
We all have to do something.

1576
02:24:54,400 --> 02:24:56,120
We've just received news that the Defence..

1577
02:24:56,200 --> 02:24:58,857
.. Minister's assassins are hiding
in the All India Radio building.

1578
02:24:58,858 --> 02:25:01,066
Karan Singhania and his friends are still with us.

1579
02:25:01,566 --> 02:25:09,191
Listeners can call in on 3291777.

1580
02:25:09,691 --> 02:25:13,191
Until then..

1581
02:25:19,858 --> 02:25:23,358
It's done.

1582
02:25:30,983 --> 02:25:34,108
"Hey, dude!"

1583
02:25:34,608 --> 02:25:42,441
"I just realized."

1584
02:25:42,941 --> 02:25:50,358
"There's a fire burning within me."

1585
02:25:50,858 --> 02:25:54,150
"It's a new dawn."

1586
02:25:54,650 --> 02:25:58,108
"I can feel its light."

1587
02:25:58,608 --> 02:26:04,733
"Burn so bright, I could, scorch the sun."

1588
02:26:05,233 --> 02:26:12,733
"Cause I'm face to face with the light."

1589
02:26:13,233 --> 02:26:21,233
"Cause I'm face to face with the light."

1590
02:26:22,025 --> 02:26:30,025
"The dream I once lost, I've found."

1591
02:26:33,941 --> 02:26:37,483
"It's blooming."

1592
02:26:37,983 --> 02:26:45,525
"It's melting."

1593
02:26:46,025 --> 02:26:53,233
"Notes arranging."

1594
02:26:53,733 --> 02:27:01,733
"Into a whole new melody."

1595
02:27:03,233 --> 02:27:06,650
Will they give us good food in jail?

1596
02:27:07,150 --> 02:27:10,650
Food? Next he'll want beer.

1597
02:27:17,775 --> 02:27:19,441
You guys have become famous.

1598
02:27:19,941 --> 02:27:22,441
Calls are pouring in from all over the country.

1599
02:27:22,941 --> 02:27:25,150
Come on! They want to talk to you..

1600
02:27:25,650 --> 02:27:30,066
Your news has spread everywhere.

1601
02:27:30,566 --> 02:27:32,316
Police! - Police!

1602
02:27:32,816 --> 02:27:34,416
This is unreal man. How did this happen?

1603
02:27:34,816 --> 02:27:37,316
Where did they come from?
This will ruin my career..

1604
02:27:37,816 --> 02:27:40,150
Quiet! You move, Karan, get him out.

1605
02:27:40,650 --> 02:27:42,570
Karan you get on air.. We don't have much time..

1606
02:27:42,983 --> 02:27:44,703
They will catch us within Fifteen minutes..

1607
02:27:44,941 --> 02:27:46,381
.. you go and say whatever you want.

1608
02:27:46,691 --> 02:27:50,191
Take care.

1609
02:27:52,566 --> 02:27:54,326
The Delhi police have reached the spot and..

1610
02:27:54,400 --> 02:27:56,400
.. are rescuing civilians trapped in the building.

1611
02:27:56,816 --> 02:27:58,616
The responsibility of the Minister's murder..

1612
02:27:58,983 --> 02:28:00,143
.. has just reached Calcutta.

1613
02:28:00,566 --> 02:28:03,150
I am in Bangalore and as you
can see all the students..

1614
02:28:03,650 --> 02:28:05,566
.. reporting from Mumbai's Churchgate area..

1615
02:28:06,066 --> 02:28:07,786
.. reporting from Cotton College, Guwahati.

1616
02:28:08,150 --> 02:28:09,870
.. reporting from S. P. College, Srinagar..

1617
02:28:10,233 --> 02:28:11,753
.. reporting from Lucknow University..

1618
02:28:11,858 --> 02:28:14,275
.. and the reactions are coming very fast.

1619
02:28:14,775 --> 02:28:17,525
Hi, my name is Prakash. And
I want to congratulate you.

1620
02:28:17,925 --> 02:28:19,565
You did the right thing by killing him.

1621
02:28:19,566 --> 02:28:23,066
All our ministers should be lined up and shot.

1622
02:28:23,566 --> 02:28:26,900
Mr. Prakash, who all will you shoot?

1623
02:28:27,400 --> 02:28:30,650
These corrupt ministers are a
reflection of our society.

1624
02:28:31,150 --> 02:28:32,525
We've chosen them.

1625
02:28:33,025 --> 02:28:35,275
If they are corrupt then so are we.

1626
02:28:35,775 --> 02:28:38,108
We need to change ourselves
to bring about a change.

1627
02:28:38,608 --> 02:28:40,368
Hello this is Principal Sharma, Government..

1628
02:28:40,400 --> 02:28:42,941
.. Higher Secondary School from Indore..

1629
02:28:43,341 --> 02:28:44,899
You have set a bad example by taking..

1630
02:28:44,900 --> 02:28:48,191
.. the law into your own hands.

1631
02:28:48,691 --> 02:28:52,608
You're right sir. We're sorry.

1632
02:28:53,108 --> 02:28:55,566
But give me the name of one politician who..

1633
02:28:56,066 --> 02:28:59,400
.. has gone to jail for his crimes.

1634
02:28:59,900 --> 02:29:01,775
Who else is on your hit-list?

1635
02:29:02,275 --> 02:29:04,483
We have no hit-list.

1636
02:29:04,983 --> 02:29:07,023
How do you feel after killing
the Defence Minister?

1637
02:29:07,441 --> 02:29:10,983
We had no enmity. It's not that we
killed him and have cooled down.

1638
02:29:11,483 --> 02:29:14,983
We still have the rage within.

1639
02:29:31,316 --> 02:29:35,358
If you get caught you'll be hanged.
Aren't you afraid?

1640
02:29:35,858 --> 02:29:39,525
No.

1641
02:29:40,025 --> 02:29:44,150
As you can see the Black
Cats have reached the place.

1642
02:29:44,650 --> 02:29:50,150
And the boys who have killed
the minister are still inside.

1643
02:29:50,650 --> 02:29:52,983
Karan, I don't know whether
you did right or wrong..

1644
02:29:53,483 --> 02:29:57,608
..while we applaud your courage, do
you think you will get out alive?

1645
02:29:58,108 --> 02:30:01,441
Death doesn't scare us.

1646
02:30:01,941 --> 02:30:05,441
No one should remain alive. I don't
want any survivor. - Yes sir.

1647
02:30:27,025 --> 02:30:29,275
Sukhi

1648
02:30:29,775 --> 02:30:31,525
Bullets are being shot in All India Radio.

1649
02:30:32,025 --> 02:30:35,525
Ravi, please make him go quickly.

1650
02:30:41,775 --> 02:30:44,775
Shit! They're shooting at us DJ!
They're shooting at us!

1651
02:30:45,275 --> 02:30:51,150
Shut up for a second!

1652
02:30:51,650 --> 02:30:56,400
They're mistaking us for terrorists.
They think we're armed.

1653
02:30:56,900 --> 02:31:00,400
Don't worry, I will handle it, Don't worry.

1654
02:31:13,483 --> 02:31:20,358
No.. Kill me.. Kill me..

1655
02:31:20,858 --> 02:31:28,858
Sukhi.. No Sukhi! What did you do!
What did you do?

1656
02:31:31,108 --> 02:31:39,108
Shit DJ! Just when I was getting
good with the girls.. - No, Sukhi..

1657
02:31:40,566 --> 02:31:44,066
No, Sukhi..

1658
02:31:58,650 --> 02:32:00,290
My name is Indra. What's the difference..

1659
02:32:00,650 --> 02:32:01,858
.. between you and terrorists?

1660
02:32:02,358 --> 02:32:05,858
There's a big difference.. terrorists
kill innocents, we didn't..

1661
02:32:15,858 --> 02:32:19,358
Aslam..

1662
02:32:21,900 --> 02:32:24,691
..close the door. Quick!

1663
02:32:25,191 --> 02:32:28,691
We are not terrorists. Why don't they..

1664
02:33:18,900 --> 02:33:22,025
It's not a lust for blood..
It's a matter of justice!

1665
02:33:22,125 --> 02:33:23,899
Why are bullets being used when it's clear..

1666
02:33:23,900 --> 02:33:26,691
.. that these are college students?

1667
02:33:27,191 --> 02:33:30,691
This is Shomu Bose from All India Radio for NDTV.

1668
02:35:12,775 --> 02:35:16,358
No matter what you do, this country..

1669
02:35:16,858 --> 02:35:24,733
.. will never change. It has no future.

1670
02:35:25,233 --> 02:35:28,733
No country is perfect. You've
got to make it perfect.

1671
02:35:34,400 --> 02:35:41,400
Join the police, military, IAS..

1672
02:35:41,900 --> 02:35:46,608
Become a part of the political system..

1673
02:35:47,108 --> 02:35:53,691
This country will change.. We will change it!

1674
02:35:54,191 --> 02:35:55,711
If you believed the Defence Minister..

1675
02:35:56,108 --> 02:35:57,858
.. deserved to be punished then..

1676
02:35:58,358 --> 02:36:03,816
.. what about the allegations against your father?

1677
02:36:04,316 --> 02:36:07,691
Don't worry.. We'll find a way to fix this.

1678
02:36:08,191 --> 02:36:09,231
Is there any way out, Dad?

1679
02:36:09,566 --> 02:36:13,066
Of course, I am there, I will handle everything.

1680
02:36:29,275 --> 02:36:32,775
I'm sorry Dad..

1681
02:37:00,358 --> 02:37:03,233
My name is Daljeet Singh.

1682
02:37:03,733 --> 02:37:06,566
There are only two ways to live your life.

1683
02:37:07,066 --> 02:37:13,983
Tolerate things the way they are.

1684
02:37:14,483 --> 02:37:20,900
Or take responsibility to change them.

1685
02:37:21,400 --> 02:37:24,900
Karan Singhania killed his
father before coming here.

1686
02:37:33,650 --> 02:37:38,400
Shit DJ!

1687
02:37:38,900 --> 02:37:41,108
You're bleeding badly!

1688
02:37:41,608 --> 02:37:45,858
Relax! It got tired of flowing in my veins.

1689
02:37:46,358 --> 02:37:49,441
It just wanted to be free.

1690
02:37:49,941 --> 02:37:53,066
Aslam.. Laxman.. Sukhi?

1691
02:37:53,566 --> 02:37:57,066
All gone.

1692
02:38:07,191 --> 02:38:13,816
.. Karan, I think I'm in love..

1693
02:38:14,316 --> 02:38:17,275
.. I never told you dude..

1694
02:38:17,775 --> 02:38:24,400
.. can't stop thinking about her..

1695
02:38:24,900 --> 02:38:29,275
I know.. she's something else.

1696
02:38:29,775 --> 02:38:33,275
You two'll make a great couple.

1697
02:38:37,691 --> 02:38:41,108
There's just one problem. I don't know if..

1698
02:38:41,608 --> 02:38:45,108
.. the kids will be black or white.

1699
02:38:49,525 --> 02:38:53,025
Damn Exhibitionist!

1700
02:39:08,316 --> 02:39:11,816
Let me go! They're just boys, damn it!

1701
02:39:24,025 --> 02:39:27,441
I always believed that there were
two kinds of men in this world.

1702
02:39:27,941 --> 02:39:31,150
.. who go to their death screaming and men..

1703
02:39:31,650 --> 02:39:35,691
Men who go to their death in silence.

1704
02:39:36,191 --> 02:39:39,691
And then I met the third kind.

1705
02:40:26,441 --> 02:40:28,401
Sending the commandoes is the death of democracy.

1706
02:40:28,566 --> 02:40:30,900
Today is a sad day in the
history of Indian politics.

1707
02:40:31,400 --> 02:40:33,691
We'll turn this small lamp in to a huge fireball.

1708
02:40:34,191 --> 02:40:36,941
There will be an awakening and will
take a huge toll on corruption.

1709
02:40:37,441 --> 02:40:39,561
The truth has to come out
in some way and if it has..

1710
02:40:39,608 --> 02:40:41,528
.. to come out like this then we are all for it.

1711
02:40:41,608 --> 02:40:45,941
We need such awakening if we want
every individual to step out.

1712
02:40:46,441 --> 02:40:47,983
Are we going to sit and do nothing?

1713
02:40:48,483 --> 02:40:49,857
So we have got to take some steps.

1714
02:40:49,858 --> 02:40:52,400
They have done it. They have
taken the right decision.

1715
02:40:52,900 --> 02:40:55,233
That day will come when
everything will be beautiful..

1716
02:40:55,733 --> 02:40:57,191
.. and there will be no corruption.

1717
02:40:57,691 --> 02:40:59,931
The fire that you have ignited
in our minds and hearts..

1718
02:41:00,233 --> 02:41:01,833
.. it's not going to fizz out very soon.

1719
02:41:01,841 --> 02:41:04,440
We will make sure that your dream
goes till the end. - We will do it.

1720
02:41:04,441 --> 02:41:07,941
Dear Lord, please accept the
sacrifice of the children.

1721
02:41:18,858 --> 02:41:23,816
I come here with Sonia a lot just like old times.

1722
02:41:24,316 --> 02:41:28,025
And sometimes I hear the voices
carried by the evening breeze.

1723
02:41:28,525 --> 02:41:32,025
Not words just sounds, sounds of laughter.

1724
02:41:57,358 --> 02:42:01,150
Come Bhagat Singh..

1725
02:42:01,650 --> 02:42:03,525
Father, what are you doing?

1726
02:42:04,025 --> 02:42:07,525
I'm sowing mango seeds. If I plant
one, it will reap thousands.

1727
02:42:35,233 --> 02:42:38,316
"Hey, dude!"

1728
02:42:38,816 --> 02:42:46,650
"I just realized."

1729
02:42:47,150 --> 02:42:54,525
"There's a fire burning within me."

1730
02:42:55,025 --> 02:42:58,525
"It's a new dawn."

1731
02:42:59,025 --> 02:43:02,275
"I can feel its light."

1732
02:43:02,775 --> 02:43:08,900
"Burn so bright, I could, scorch the sun."

1733
02:43:09,400 --> 02:43:16,941
"Cause I'm face to face with the light."

1734
02:43:17,441 --> 02:43:25,441
"Cause I'm face to face with the light."

1735
02:43:26,233 --> 02:43:34,233
"The dream I once lost, I've found."

1736
02:43:38,025 --> 02:43:41,608
"It's blooming."

1737
02:43:42,108 --> 02:43:49,608
"It's melting."

1738
02:43:50,108 --> 02:43:57,400
"Notes arranging."

1739
02:43:57,900 --> 02:44:05,566
"Into a whole new melody."

1740
02:44:06,066 --> 02:44:13,400
"Cause I'm face to face with the light."

1741
02:44:13,900 --> 02:44:21,900
"Cause I'm face to face with the light."

1742
02:44:23,525 --> 02:44:26,858
"The mist has cleared, I can see the sky."

1743
02:44:27,358 --> 02:44:30,775
"A new road, a new journey stands before me."

1744
02:44:31,275 --> 02:44:38,775
"If only you could stand by my side."

1745
02:44:39,275 --> 02:44:42,733
"The mist has cleared, I can see the sky."

1746
02:44:43,233 --> 02:44:46,650
"A new road, a new journey stands before me."

1747
02:44:47,150 --> 02:44:54,691
"If only you could stand by my side,

1748
02:44:55,191 --> 02:45:02,650
"This fire is ready to face any storm."

1749
02:45:03,150 --> 02:45:11,066
"The flames burn brighter and stronger."

1750
02:45:11,566 --> 02:45:18,816
"Whether I leave my mark."

1751
02:45:19,316 --> 02:45:27,025
"Whether I stay the path."

1752
02:45:27,525 --> 02:45:34,608
"Today I've tasted the light..

1753
02:45:35,108 --> 02:45:43,108
.. Like a torch, I'm burning bright."

1754
02:45:47,275 --> 02:45:54,858
"Cause I'm face to face with the light."

1755
02:45:55,358 --> 02:46:03,191
"Cause I'm face to face with the light."

1756
02:46:03,691 --> 02:46:07,066
"The mist has cleared, I can see the sky."

1757
02:46:07,566 --> 02:46:11,025
"A new road, a new journey, stands before me."

1758
02:46:11,525 --> 02:46:17,566
"If only you could stand by my side."

1759
02:46:18,066 --> 02:46:25,483
"Cause I'm face to face with the light."

1760
02:46:25,983 --> 02:46:33,983
"Cause I'm face to face with the light."
