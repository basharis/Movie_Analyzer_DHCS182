1
00:02:06,392 --> 00:02:08,226
She isn't coming yet, Toto.

2
00:02:08,394 --> 00:02:09,895
Did she hurt you?

3
00:02:10,063 --> 00:02:11,855
She tried to, didn't she?

4
00:02:12,023 --> 00:02:15,317
Come on. We'll go tell Uncle Henry
and Auntie Em. Come on, Toto.

5
00:02:23,618 --> 00:02:26,661
Aunt Em! Aunt Em!

6
00:02:26,871 --> 00:02:29,289
Just listen to what Miss Gulch
did to Toto...

7
00:02:29,457 --> 00:02:31,291
Dorothy, please. We're counting.

8
00:02:31,459 --> 00:02:34,211
- But she hit him...
- Don't bother us now, honey.

9
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:39,216
The incubator's gone bad and
we're likely to lose a lot of our chicks.

10
00:02:39,384 --> 00:02:41,134
Oh, that poor little thing.

11
00:02:41,302 --> 00:02:44,011
But Miss Gulch hit Toto with a rake...

12
00:02:44,179 --> 00:02:47,640
...because she says he chases
her nasty old cat every day!

13
00:02:47,808 --> 00:02:49,975
- Seventy. Dorothy, please!

14
00:02:50,143 --> 00:02:53,312
But he doesn't do it every day!
Just once or twice a week.

15
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,356
He can't catch her old cat anyway.

16
00:02:55,524 --> 00:02:59,777
- And now she says she's gonna...
- Dorothy. Dorothy, we're busy.

17
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:03,531
Oh, all right.

18
00:03:06,743 --> 00:03:08,869
How's she coming?
Take it easy.

19
00:03:09,079 --> 00:03:10,371
Ow!

20
00:03:10,539 --> 00:03:11,956
You got my finger!

21
00:03:12,124 --> 00:03:14,125
Get your finger out of the way.

22
00:03:14,876 --> 00:03:17,253
There you are.
Right on my finger!

23
00:03:17,421 --> 00:03:18,879
Lucky it wasn't your head.

24
00:03:19,047 --> 00:03:22,758
Zeke, what am I gonna do about
Miss Gulch? Just because Toto...

25
00:03:22,926 --> 00:03:25,428
Listen, honey,
I got them hogs to get in.

26
00:03:25,595 --> 00:03:29,723
Dorothy, you ain't using your head.
You'd think you didn't have any brains.

27
00:03:29,891 --> 00:03:32,852
- I have so got brains.
- Well, why don't you use them?

28
00:03:33,019 --> 00:03:35,020
Don't go by Miss Gulch's place.

29
00:03:35,188 --> 00:03:39,066
Then Toto won't get in her garden,
and you won't get in no trouble, see?

30
00:03:39,234 --> 00:03:42,153
Oh, Hunk, you just won't listen,
that's all.

31
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:45,614
Well, your head ain't made of straw,
you know.

32
00:03:47,576 --> 00:03:51,954
Say, get in there before I make
a dime bank out of you.

33
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:56,249
Listen, kid...

34
00:03:56,917 --> 00:04:00,545
...are you gonna let that old Gulch
heifer try and buffalo you?

35
00:04:00,754 --> 00:04:03,965
She ain't nothing to be afraid of.
Have a little courage.

36
00:04:04,133 --> 00:04:05,633
I'm not afraid of her.

37
00:04:05,801 --> 00:04:08,678
Next time she squawks,
walk up to her and spit in her eye.

38
00:04:09,096 --> 00:04:12,348
- That's what I'd do.
- Oh! Oh!

39
00:04:12,516 --> 00:04:14,309
Oh! Zeke!

40
00:04:14,477 --> 00:04:17,437
Help! Help me, Zeke!
Get me out of here!

41
00:04:17,605 --> 00:04:19,355
Help!

42
00:04:19,523 --> 00:04:21,107
Oh! Oh!

43
00:04:21,275 --> 00:04:24,569
Are you all right, Dorothy?
- Yes, I'm all right.

44
00:04:24,737 --> 00:04:27,739
I fell in, and Zeke...

45
00:04:29,074 --> 00:04:32,076
Why, Zeke, you're just
as scared as I am.

46
00:04:32,244 --> 00:04:35,246
You gonna let a little old pig
make a coward out of you?

47
00:04:35,414 --> 00:04:36,456
Look at you...

48
00:04:36,624 --> 00:04:39,709
What's all this jabber-wapping
when there's work to be done?

49
00:04:39,877 --> 00:04:42,879
I know three farm hands
that'll be out of a job.

50
00:04:43,047 --> 00:04:44,088
Dorothy was...

51
00:04:44,256 --> 00:04:46,424
I saw you tinkering
with that contraption.

52
00:04:46,592 --> 00:04:49,219
- You and Hunk get back to that wagon.
All right.

53
00:04:49,386 --> 00:04:51,804
But someday they'll erect
a statue to me...

54
00:04:51,972 --> 00:04:54,641
Well, don't start posing for it now.

55
00:04:54,808 --> 00:04:57,227
Can't work on an empty stomach.
Have some crullers.

56
00:04:57,394 --> 00:04:59,521
Gosh, Mrs. Gale.
Just fried.

57
00:04:59,688 --> 00:05:01,606
You see, Dorothy toppled into the...

58
00:05:01,815 --> 00:05:03,983
It's no place for Dorothy
around a pigsty!

59
00:05:04,235 --> 00:05:06,861
Feed those hogs before they
worry themselves into anemia!

60
00:05:07,029 --> 00:05:08,362
- Yes.
- Auntie Em...

61
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:11,823
...you know what Miss Gulch
said she was going to do to Toto?

62
00:05:12,075 --> 00:05:14,660
- She said she'd...
Stop imagining things.

63
00:05:14,827 --> 00:05:18,789
You always get in a fret over nothing.
You just help us out today...

64
00:05:18,957 --> 00:05:22,709
...and find yourself a place where
you won't get into any trouble.

65
00:05:25,004 --> 00:05:27,839
Someplace where there
isn't any trouble.

66
00:05:28,675 --> 00:05:31,760
Do you suppose there is
such a place, Toto?

67
00:05:32,345 --> 00:05:34,471
There must be.

68
00:05:35,807 --> 00:05:40,352
It's not a place you can get to
by a boat or a train.

69
00:05:41,229 --> 00:05:44,523
It's far, far away.

70
00:05:44,816 --> 00:05:47,150
Behind the moon...

71
00:05:47,443 --> 00:05:49,444
...beyond the rain...

72
00:05:49,904 --> 00:05:56,118
Somewhere over the rainbow

73
00:05:56,286 --> 00:06:01,331
Way up high

74
00:06:01,499 --> 00:06:06,336
There's a land that I heard of

75
00:06:06,504 --> 00:06:11,633
Once in a lullaby

76
00:06:11,801 --> 00:06:18,015
Somewhere over the rainbow

77
00:06:18,182 --> 00:06:23,019
Skies are blue

78
00:06:23,186 --> 00:06:28,649
And the dreams that you dare to dream

79
00:06:28,817 --> 00:06:33,070
Really do come true

80
00:06:33,655 --> 00:06:37,658
Someday I'll wish upon a star

81
00:06:37,826 --> 00:06:44,707
And wake up where the clouds
Are far behind me

82
00:06:46,168 --> 00:06:48,753
Where troubles melt like lemon drops

83
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,714
Away above the chimney tops

84
00:06:51,882 --> 00:06:54,884
That's where you'll...

85
00:06:55,052 --> 00:07:00,973
...find me

86
00:07:01,141 --> 00:07:07,355
Somewhere over the rainbow

87
00:07:07,522 --> 00:07:12,777
Bluebirds fly

88
00:07:12,944 --> 00:07:19,033
Birds fly over the rainbow

89
00:07:19,201 --> 00:07:22,036
Why then...

90
00:07:22,204 --> 00:07:29,001
...oh, why can't I?

91
00:07:38,844 --> 00:07:42,389
If happy little bluebirds fly

92
00:07:42,556 --> 00:07:45,684
Beyond the rainbow

93
00:07:45,851 --> 00:07:48,937
Why, oh, why...

94
00:07:49,105 --> 00:07:55,777
...can't I?

95
00:08:17,258 --> 00:08:20,677
Mr. Gale.
Howdy, Miss Gulch.

96
00:08:20,928 --> 00:08:23,805
I want to see you and your wife
about Dorothy.

97
00:08:23,973 --> 00:08:26,266
- What has Dorothy done?
- What's she done?

98
00:08:26,434 --> 00:08:28,768
I'm all but lame from
the bite on my leg!

99
00:08:28,936 --> 00:08:31,604
- You mean, she bit you?
- No, her dog!

100
00:08:31,772 --> 00:08:35,483
Oh, she bit her dog, eh?

101
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:37,694
No.

102
00:08:38,487 --> 00:08:42,157
That dog's a menace. I'm taking him
to make sure he's destroyed.

103
00:08:42,324 --> 00:08:44,576
Destroyed! Toto?

104
00:08:44,744 --> 00:08:46,618
Oh, you can't! You mustn't!

105
00:08:46,786 --> 00:08:49,872
Auntie Em! Uncle Henry!
You won't let her, will you?

106
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:51,874
Of course we won't.

107
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:53,459
Uh, will we, Em?

108
00:08:53,626 --> 00:08:55,127
Please, Aunt Em!

109
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:57,755
Toto didn't know he was
doing anything wrong.

110
00:08:57,922 --> 00:09:02,468
I'm the one that ought to be punished.
Send me to bed without supper.

111
00:09:02,635 --> 00:09:05,637
Hand over that dog or I'll bring
a suit that'll take your farm!

112
00:09:05,805 --> 00:09:08,015
The law protects folks
against dogs that bite!

113
00:09:08,183 --> 00:09:10,809
How about if she keeps him tied up?
He's gentle.

114
00:09:10,977 --> 00:09:14,688
- With gentle people, that is.
- That's for the sheriff to decide.

115
00:09:14,856 --> 00:09:19,359
This order allows me to take him.
Unless you wanna go against the law.

116
00:09:19,819 --> 00:09:23,030
Hm. Yes.

117
00:09:23,198 --> 00:09:26,533
We can't go against the law.
I'm afraid poor Toto has to go.

118
00:09:26,701 --> 00:09:28,160
- Now you're seeing reason.
- No.

119
00:09:28,369 --> 00:09:31,288
Here's what I'm taking him in,
so he can't attack me again.

120
00:09:31,456 --> 00:09:33,624
No, No! I won't let you take him!

121
00:09:33,792 --> 00:09:37,211
- You go away or I'll bite you myself!
Dorothy!

122
00:09:37,378 --> 00:09:41,507
You wicked old witch! Uncle Henry,
Auntie Em, don't let her take Toto.

123
00:09:41,674 --> 00:09:42,966
I've got an order!

124
00:09:43,134 --> 00:09:44,510
- Let me have him!
- Please stop!

125
00:09:44,677 --> 00:09:46,178
Put him in the basket, Henry.

126
00:09:46,346 --> 00:09:48,388
- The idea!
- Don't, Uncle Henry.

127
00:09:50,892 --> 00:09:52,726
Oh, Toto!

128
00:10:02,945 --> 00:10:05,988
Almira Gulch, just because
you own half the county...

129
00:10:06,156 --> 00:10:08,449
...doesn't mean you can
run the rest of us!

130
00:10:08,617 --> 00:10:11,828
For 23 years I've been dying
to tell you what I thought of you!

131
00:10:11,995 --> 00:10:13,079
And now...

132
00:10:13,247 --> 00:10:16,749
Well, being a Christian woman,
I can't say it!

133
00:10:42,025 --> 00:10:43,484
Toto, darling!

134
00:10:43,652 --> 00:10:47,697
Oh, I got you back!
You came back!

135
00:10:47,865 --> 00:10:50,533
I'm so glad!

136
00:10:53,996 --> 00:10:56,789
They'll be coming back
for you in a minute.

137
00:10:57,875 --> 00:10:59,750
We've got to get away!

138
00:10:59,918 --> 00:11:02,044
We've got to run away!

139
00:11:36,871 --> 00:11:39,289
Well, well, well! Houseguests, eh?

140
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:42,250
And who might you be?

141
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:44,127
No, no. Now, don't tell me.

142
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:47,130
Let's see. You're...

143
00:11:47,298 --> 00:11:48,924
You're traveling in disguise.

144
00:11:49,091 --> 00:11:51,801
No, that's not right. You're...

145
00:11:51,969 --> 00:11:53,511
You're going on a visit.

146
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:55,764
No, I'm wrong. Let's see what we...

147
00:11:55,932 --> 00:11:58,433
You're... You're running away.

148
00:11:58,601 --> 00:12:00,185
How did you guess?

149
00:12:00,353 --> 00:12:02,771
Professor Marvel never guesses,
he knows.

150
00:12:02,939 --> 00:12:06,942
Now, why are you running away?
No, no. Now, don't tell me.

151
00:12:07,109 --> 00:12:10,487
They... They don't understand you
at home. They don't appreciate you.

152
00:12:10,655 --> 00:12:14,783
You want to see other lands.
Big cities, big mountains, big oceans.

153
00:12:14,951 --> 00:12:17,786
Why, it's just like you could
read what was inside of me.

154
00:12:19,538 --> 00:12:22,207
Toto, that's not polite!
We haven't been asked yet.

155
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:25,209
Oh, he's perfectly welcome.

156
00:12:25,377 --> 00:12:28,170
As one dog to another, huh?

157
00:12:28,588 --> 00:12:30,381
Now, let's see, where were we?

158
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:34,426
Why can't we go with you and
see all the crowned heads of Europe?

159
00:12:34,594 --> 00:12:37,513
Do you know any?
Oh, you mean the thing. Yes.

160
00:12:37,681 --> 00:12:42,351
Well, uh, I never do anything without
consulting my crystal first.

161
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:46,814
Let's go inside here. We'll...
Just come along. I'll show you.

162
00:12:47,148 --> 00:12:51,568
That's right. Here.
Sit right down here. That's it.

163
00:12:51,736 --> 00:12:56,740
This is the same genuine,
magic, authentic crystal...

164
00:12:56,908 --> 00:13:01,787
...used by the priests of Isis and
Osiris in the days of the Pharaohs...

165
00:13:01,955 --> 00:13:07,001
...in which Cleopatra saw the approach
of Julius Caesar and Marc Anthony.

166
00:13:07,168 --> 00:13:10,129
And so on, and so on. Now...

167
00:13:10,296 --> 00:13:13,507
...you'd better close your eyes,
my child, for a moment...

168
00:13:13,675 --> 00:13:18,846
...in order to be better in tuned
with the Infinite.

169
00:13:19,806 --> 00:13:24,393
We can't do these things without
reaching out into the Infinite.

170
00:13:24,561 --> 00:13:27,229
Yes, that's all right.
Now you can open them.

171
00:13:27,397 --> 00:13:30,441
We'll gaze into the crystal.

172
00:13:30,608 --> 00:13:32,026
Ah.

173
00:13:32,193 --> 00:13:35,945
What's this I see?
A house with a picket fence...

174
00:13:36,113 --> 00:13:39,282
...and a barn with a weathervane...

175
00:13:39,575 --> 00:13:41,659
...of a running horse.

176
00:13:41,827 --> 00:13:43,911
- That's our farm!
- Yes.

177
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:46,664
Yes. There's a woman.

178
00:13:46,832 --> 00:13:51,669
She's wearing a polka-dot dress.
Her face is careworn.

179
00:13:51,837 --> 00:13:53,296
That's Aunt Em.

180
00:13:53,464 --> 00:13:55,506
Yes. Her name is Emily.

181
00:13:55,674 --> 00:13:57,925
That's right. What's she doing?

182
00:13:58,093 --> 00:14:00,636
Well, I can't quite see.

183
00:14:00,804 --> 00:14:03,848
Why, she's crying.
Someone has hurt her.

184
00:14:04,016 --> 00:14:07,018
Someone has just about
broken her heart.

185
00:14:07,186 --> 00:14:08,227
Me?

186
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:11,397
Well, it's... It's someone
she loves very much.

187
00:14:11,565 --> 00:14:13,649
Someone she's been very kind to.

188
00:14:13,817 --> 00:14:16,069
Someone she's taken care of
in sickness.

189
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:20,531
I had the measles once, and she stayed
right by me every minute.

190
00:14:20,699 --> 00:14:21,824
Uh-huh.

191
00:14:21,992 --> 00:14:23,826
What's she doing now?

192
00:14:23,994 --> 00:14:26,496
Yes, she's... What's this?

193
00:14:26,663 --> 00:14:29,707
Why, she's putting her hand
on her heart!

194
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:33,169
- She's dropping down on the bed.
- Oh, no, no!

195
00:14:33,337 --> 00:14:36,964
Well, that's all.
The crystal's gone dark.

196
00:14:37,132 --> 00:14:39,967
You don't suppose she could
really be sick, do you?

197
00:14:40,135 --> 00:14:43,971
- Oh, I've gotta go home right away.
- I thought you were going with me.

198
00:14:44,139 --> 00:14:46,432
No, I have to get to her right away!

199
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,725
Come on, Toto! Come on!

200
00:14:50,728 --> 00:14:54,231
Goodbye, Professor Marvel.
And thanks a lot!

201
00:14:56,359 --> 00:14:59,319
Better get under cover, Sylvester.
A storm's blowing up.

202
00:14:59,487 --> 00:15:02,739
A whopper, to speak in
the vernacular of the peasantry.

203
00:15:02,907 --> 00:15:06,118
Poor little kid.
I hope she gets home all right.

204
00:15:15,002 --> 00:15:16,503
Get them horses loose!

205
00:15:16,671 --> 00:15:19,798
Where's Hickory? Hickory?

206
00:15:19,966 --> 00:15:21,842
Doggone it!

207
00:15:23,302 --> 00:15:26,388
It's a twister! It's a twister!

208
00:15:32,937 --> 00:15:41,027
Dorothy!

209
00:15:51,747 --> 00:15:53,915
Everybody in the storm cellar!

210
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:06,468
Henry, I can't find Dorothy!
She's out in the storm!

211
00:16:06,636 --> 00:16:08,554
We can't look for her now.

212
00:16:08,722 --> 00:16:11,390
Come on, get in the cellar!
Hurry up!

213
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:37,791
Auntie Em!

214
00:16:38,501 --> 00:16:40,419
Auntie Em?

215
00:16:42,172 --> 00:16:43,923
Auntie Em!

216
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:55,559
Auntie Em! Uncle Henry!

217
00:17:04,611 --> 00:17:05,945
Auntie Em!

218
00:18:14,221 --> 00:18:16,764
We must be up inside the cyclone!

219
00:18:19,852 --> 00:18:22,770
Oh! Miss Gulch!

220
00:19:00,933 --> 00:19:02,351
Oh!

221
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:51,166
Toto...

222
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:55,086
...I have a feeling we're not
in Kansas anymore.

223
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:07,599
We must be over the rainbow!

224
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:40,006
Now I know we're not in Kansas.

225
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:45,887
Are you a good witch or a bad witch?

226
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:48,181
Who, me?

227
00:21:48,349 --> 00:21:50,433
Why, I'm not a witch at all.

228
00:21:50,601 --> 00:21:53,520
- I'm Dorothy Gale, from Kansas.
- Oh.

229
00:21:53,771 --> 00:21:55,480
Well, is that the witch?

230
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:58,816
Who, Toto? Toto's my dog.

231
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:02,237
I'm a little muddled. The Munchkins
called me because a new witch...

232
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:05,239
...just dropped a house on
the Wicked Witch of the East.

233
00:22:05,406 --> 00:22:07,824
And there's the house,
and here you are...

234
00:22:07,992 --> 00:22:11,036
...and that's all that's left
of the Wicked Witch of the East.

235
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:17,334
What the Munchkins want to know is,
are you a good witch or a bad witch?

236
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:20,087
But I've already told you,
I'm not a witch at all.

237
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:22,047
Witches are old and ugly.

238
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:25,676
What was that?

239
00:22:25,885 --> 00:22:29,429
The Munchkins. They're laughing
because I am a witch.

240
00:22:29,597 --> 00:22:31,848
I'm Glinda, the Witch of the North.

241
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:33,892
You are?

242
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:35,519
Oh, I beg your pardon!

243
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:38,939
But I've never heard
of a beautiful witch before.

244
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:41,567
Only bad witches are ugly.

245
00:22:41,776 --> 00:22:44,236
The Munchkins are happy
because you freed them...

246
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:48,240
...from the Wicked Witch of the East.
- But if you please, what are Munchkins?

247
00:22:49,617 --> 00:22:52,202
The little people who live here.
It's Munchkinland...

248
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:54,955
...and you are their national heroine,
my dear.

249
00:22:55,123 --> 00:22:59,167
It's all right.
You may all come out and thank her.

250
00:22:59,502 --> 00:23:03,589
Come out, come out
Wherever you are

251
00:23:03,756 --> 00:23:09,970
And meet the young lady
Who fell from a star

252
00:23:12,765 --> 00:23:17,059
She fell from the sky
She fell very far

253
00:23:17,227 --> 00:23:22,231
And Kansas, she says
Is the name of the star

254
00:23:22,441 --> 00:23:25,026
Kansas, she says

255
00:23:25,193 --> 00:23:26,777
Is the name of the star

256
00:23:29,948 --> 00:23:32,074
She brings you good news

257
00:23:32,242 --> 00:23:34,577
Or haven't you heard?

258
00:23:34,745 --> 00:23:37,913
When she fell out of Kansas

259
00:23:38,081 --> 00:23:41,959
A miracle occurred

260
00:23:44,087 --> 00:23:47,131
It really was no miracle
What happened was just this

261
00:23:47,299 --> 00:23:50,593
The wind began to switch
The house to pitch

262
00:23:50,761 --> 00:23:54,013
And suddenly the hinges
Started to unhitch

263
00:23:54,181 --> 00:23:57,516
Just then the Witch
To satisfy an itch

264
00:23:57,684 --> 00:24:01,020
Went flying on her broomstick
Thumbing for a hitch

265
00:24:01,188 --> 00:24:04,482
And oh, what happened then was rich

266
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:06,651
The house began to pitch

267
00:24:06,818 --> 00:24:08,235
The kitchen took a slitch

268
00:24:08,445 --> 00:24:11,072
It landed on the Wicked Witch
In the middle of a ditch

269
00:24:11,239 --> 00:24:16,494
Which was not a healthy situation
For the Wicked Witch

270
00:24:16,703 --> 00:24:19,538
The house began to pitch
The kitchen took a slitch

271
00:24:19,706 --> 00:24:22,625
It landed on the Wicked Witch
In the middle of a ditch

272
00:24:22,793 --> 00:24:27,463
Which was not a healthy situation
For the Wicked Witch

273
00:24:27,631 --> 00:24:31,883
Who began to twitch
And was reduced to just a stitch

274
00:24:32,051 --> 00:24:36,221
Of what was once the Wicked Witch

275
00:24:42,186 --> 00:24:44,354
We thank you very sweetly

276
00:24:44,522 --> 00:24:46,773
For doing it so neatly

277
00:24:46,941 --> 00:24:49,484
You've killed her so completely

278
00:24:49,652 --> 00:24:53,071
That we thank you very sweetly

279
00:24:53,572 --> 00:24:58,785
Let the joyous news be spread!
The Wicked Old Witch at last is dead!

280
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:04,207
Ding-Dong! The Witch is dead

281
00:25:04,375 --> 00:25:05,875
Which old witch? The Wicked Witch

282
00:25:06,043 --> 00:25:09,587
Ding-Dong! The Wicked Witch is dead

283
00:25:09,755 --> 00:25:13,425
Wake up, you sleepyhead
Rub your eyes, get out of bed

284
00:25:13,592 --> 00:25:16,928
Wake up, the Wicked Witch is dead

285
00:25:17,096 --> 00:25:20,765
She's gone where the goblins go
Below, below, below

286
00:25:20,933 --> 00:25:24,769
Yo-ho! Let's open up and sing
And ring the bells out

287
00:25:24,937 --> 00:25:28,356
Ding-Dong! The merry-o
Sing it high, sing it low

288
00:25:28,858 --> 00:25:32,694
Let them know
The Wicked Witch is dead

289
00:25:52,714 --> 00:25:56,216
As mayor of the Munchkin City

290
00:25:56,384 --> 00:25:59,720
In the county of the Land of Oz

291
00:25:59,888 --> 00:26:03,307
I welcome you most regally

292
00:26:03,475 --> 00:26:06,769
But we've got to verify it legally

293
00:26:06,936 --> 00:26:08,437
- To see
- To see?

294
00:26:08,605 --> 00:26:10,105
- If she
- If she?

295
00:26:10,273 --> 00:26:12,149
Is morally, ethically

296
00:26:12,317 --> 00:26:15,402
- Spiritually, physically
- Positively, absolutely

297
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:21,158
Undeniably and reliably dead

298
00:26:27,624 --> 00:26:30,584
As coroner I must aver

299
00:26:30,752 --> 00:26:33,545
I thoroughly examined her

300
00:26:33,713 --> 00:26:36,590
And she's not only merely dead

301
00:26:36,758 --> 00:26:40,177
She's really most sincerely dead

302
00:26:42,555 --> 00:26:44,598
Then this is a Day of Independence...

303
00:26:44,766 --> 00:26:47,476
...for all the Munchkins
and their descendants.

304
00:26:47,644 --> 00:26:48,685
If any!

305
00:26:48,853 --> 00:26:54,315
Yes, let the joyous news be spread.
The Wicked Old Witch at last is dead!

306
00:26:54,483 --> 00:26:56,651
Ding-Dong! The Witch is dead

307
00:26:56,819 --> 00:26:58,319
Which old witch? The Wicked Witch

308
00:26:58,487 --> 00:27:01,656
Ding-Dong! The Wicked Witch is dead

309
00:27:01,824 --> 00:27:05,159
Wake up, you sleepyhead
Rub your eyes, get out of bed

310
00:27:05,327 --> 00:27:08,621
Wake up
The Wicked Witch is dead

311
00:27:08,789 --> 00:27:12,124
She's gone where the goblins go
Below, below, below

312
00:27:12,292 --> 00:27:16,045
Yo-ho! Let's open up and sing
And ring the bells out

313
00:27:16,213 --> 00:27:19,674
Ding-Dong! The merry-o
Sing it high, sing it low

314
00:27:19,842 --> 00:27:23,553
Let them know the Wicked Witch is dead

315
00:27:47,452 --> 00:27:50,705
We represent the Lullaby League

316
00:27:50,873 --> 00:27:53,916
The Lullaby League
The Lullaby League

317
00:27:54,084 --> 00:27:58,713
And in the name of the Lullaby League

318
00:27:58,881 --> 00:28:03,092
We wish to welcome you
To Munchkinland

319
00:28:12,268 --> 00:28:15,478
We represent the Lollipop Guild

320
00:28:15,646 --> 00:28:18,940
The Lollipop Guild
The Lollipop Guild

321
00:28:19,108 --> 00:28:23,236
And in the name of the Lollipop Guild

322
00:28:23,446 --> 00:28:28,533
We wish to welcome you
To Munchkinland

323
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:32,162
We welcome you to Munchkinland

324
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:35,540
Tra-la-la-la-la-la
Tra-la-la, tra-la-la

325
00:28:37,084 --> 00:28:39,085
Tra-la-la-la-la
La-la

326
00:28:39,253 --> 00:28:41,338
From now on you'll be history

327
00:28:41,505 --> 00:28:43,798
- You'll be his...
- You'll be history

328
00:28:43,966 --> 00:28:47,969
And we will glorify your name

329
00:28:48,137 --> 00:28:49,596
- You will be a bust
- Be a bust

330
00:28:49,764 --> 00:28:53,016
- Be a bust
- In the hall of fame

331
00:28:53,351 --> 00:28:55,018
Tra-la-la-la-la-la
Tra-la-la, tra-la-la

332
00:28:55,186 --> 00:28:57,187
Tra-la-la-la-la
La-la

333
00:28:57,355 --> 00:28:59,314
Tra-la-la-la-la-la
Tra-la-la, tra-la-la

334
00:28:59,482 --> 00:29:01,524
Tra-la-la-la-la
La-la

335
00:29:01,692 --> 00:29:03,777
Tra-la-la-la-la-la
Tra-la-la, tra-la-la

336
00:29:03,945 --> 00:29:06,821
Tra-la-la-la-la
La...

337
00:29:22,629 --> 00:29:24,296
I thought you said she was dead.

338
00:29:24,464 --> 00:29:26,966
That was her sister,
the Wicked Witch of the East.

339
00:29:27,133 --> 00:29:31,095
This is the Wicked Witch of the West.
She's worse than the other one was.

340
00:29:31,262 --> 00:29:35,099
Who killed my sister?
Who killed the Witch of the East?

341
00:29:35,266 --> 00:29:36,725
Was it you?

342
00:29:36,935 --> 00:29:40,938
No. No, it was an accident.
I didn't mean to kill anybody.

343
00:29:41,106 --> 00:29:44,525
Well, my little pretty,
I can cause accidents too!

344
00:29:44,693 --> 00:29:48,153
- Aren't you forgetting the ruby slippers?
- The slippers. Yes!

345
00:29:48,863 --> 00:29:51,115
The slippers!

346
00:29:57,831 --> 00:29:58,872
They're gone!

347
00:29:59,124 --> 00:30:01,500
The ruby slippers!
What have you done with them?

348
00:30:01,668 --> 00:30:03,377
Give them back to me or I'll...

349
00:30:03,545 --> 00:30:07,089
It's too late! There they are,
and there they'll stay!

350
00:30:11,219 --> 00:30:14,555
Give me back my slippers!
Only I know how to use them.

351
00:30:14,723 --> 00:30:18,267
They're of no use to you.
Give them back to me. Give them back!

352
00:30:18,435 --> 00:30:21,311
Keep tight inside of them.
Their magic must be powerful...

353
00:30:21,479 --> 00:30:23,439
...or she wouldn't want them so badly.

354
00:30:23,648 --> 00:30:26,066
Stay out of this, Glinda,
or I'll fix you as well!

355
00:30:26,234 --> 00:30:28,444
Oh, rubbish!
You have no power here.

356
00:30:28,611 --> 00:30:31,738
Begone, before somebody
drops a house on you too.

357
00:30:31,905 --> 00:30:34,866
Very well. I'll bide my time.

358
00:30:35,034 --> 00:30:39,996
And as for you, it's true I can't
attend to you here and now as I'd like.

359
00:30:40,164 --> 00:30:42,582
But just try to stay out of my way!

360
00:30:42,791 --> 00:30:43,875
Just try!

361
00:30:44,043 --> 00:30:45,960
I'll get you, my pretty...

362
00:30:46,128 --> 00:30:48,379
...and your little dog too!

363
00:30:59,183 --> 00:31:01,517
It's all right. You can get up.
She's gone!

364
00:31:02,311 --> 00:31:05,938
It's all right. You can all get up.

365
00:31:06,315 --> 00:31:07,774
Oh! What a smell of sulfur!

366
00:31:08,025 --> 00:31:11,194
I'm afraid you've made an enemy
of the Wicked Witch.

367
00:31:11,361 --> 00:31:15,615
The sooner you get out of Oz altogether,
the safer you'll sleep, my dear.

368
00:31:15,783 --> 00:31:18,910
Oh, I'd give anything
to get out of Oz altogether.

369
00:31:19,078 --> 00:31:23,122
But which is the way back to Kansas?
I can't go the way I came.

370
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:26,334
No, that's true.
The only person who might know...

371
00:31:26,502 --> 00:31:30,129
...would be the great and wonderful
Wizard of Oz himself.

372
00:31:30,297 --> 00:31:33,382
The Wizard of Oz?
Is he good or is he wicked?

373
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:36,094
Oh, very good, but very mysterious.

374
00:31:36,261 --> 00:31:39,138
He lives in the Emerald City,
a long journey from here.

375
00:31:39,306 --> 00:31:41,974
Did you bring your broomstick
with you?

376
00:31:42,267 --> 00:31:45,811
- No, I'm afraid I didn't.
- Well, then, you'll have to walk.

377
00:31:45,978 --> 00:31:49,356
The Munchkins will see you safely
to the border of Munchkinland.

378
00:31:49,524 --> 00:31:53,985
And remember, never let those ruby
slippers off your feet for a moment...

379
00:31:54,153 --> 00:31:57,989
...or you will be at the mercy
of the Wicked Witch of the West.

380
00:31:58,449 --> 00:32:01,284
But how do I start for Emerald City?

381
00:32:01,452 --> 00:32:03,537
It's always best
to start at the beginning.

382
00:32:03,704 --> 00:32:07,958
And all you do is
follow the Yellow Brick Road.

383
00:32:17,093 --> 00:32:21,847
- But what happens if I...
- Just follow the Yellow Brick Road.

384
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,558
Goodbye!

385
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:39,489
My!

386
00:32:39,657 --> 00:32:42,450
People come and go so quickly here!

387
00:32:44,912 --> 00:32:47,622
Follow the Yellow Brick Road

388
00:32:49,542 --> 00:32:52,127
Follow the Yellow Brick Road?

389
00:32:52,920 --> 00:33:02,344
Follow the Yellow Brick Road

390
00:33:02,512 --> 00:33:04,430
Follow the Yellow Brick Road

391
00:33:04,598 --> 00:33:05,848
Follow the Yellow Brick Road

392
00:33:06,016 --> 00:33:09,727
Follow, follow, follow, follow
Follow the Yellow Brick Road

393
00:33:12,856 --> 00:33:14,398
Follow the Yellow Brick

394
00:33:14,733 --> 00:33:16,817
Follow the Yellow Brick Road

395
00:33:19,738 --> 00:33:23,157
You're off to see the Wizard
The wonderful Wizard of Oz

396
00:33:23,325 --> 00:33:26,702
You'll find he is a whiz of a wiz
If ever a wiz there was

397
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:30,164
If ever, oh ever a wiz there was
The Wizard of Oz is one because

398
00:33:30,332 --> 00:33:33,667
Because, because, because
Because, because

399
00:33:33,835 --> 00:33:36,462
Because of the wonderful things he does

400
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:42,176
You're off to see the Wizard
The wonderful Wizard of Oz

401
00:33:59,486 --> 00:34:01,946
Follow the Yellow Brick Road?

402
00:34:02,239 --> 00:34:04,031
Follow the Yellow...?

403
00:34:05,325 --> 00:34:06,659
Now which way do we go?

404
00:34:06,826 --> 00:34:09,953
Pardon me!
That way is a very nice way.

405
00:34:12,706 --> 00:34:13,998
Who said that?

406
00:34:18,295 --> 00:34:19,712
Don't be silly, Toto.

407
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:23,466
- Scarecrows don't talk.
- It's pleasant down that way too.

408
00:34:24,802 --> 00:34:28,513
That's funny.
Wasn't he pointing the other way?

409
00:34:28,681 --> 00:34:32,100
Of course, people do go both ways.

410
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:39,107
Why, you did say something,
didn't you?

411
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:46,364
Are you doing that on purpose,
or can't you make up your mind?

412
00:34:46,573 --> 00:34:49,492
That's the trouble.
I can't make up my mind.

413
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:51,411
I haven't got a brain.

414
00:34:51,578 --> 00:34:53,621
Only straw.

415
00:34:53,831 --> 00:34:56,457
How can you talk if you
haven't got a brain?

416
00:34:56,625 --> 00:34:58,209
I don't know.

417
00:34:58,377 --> 00:35:02,171
But some people without brains
do a lot of talking, don't they?

418
00:35:02,339 --> 00:35:05,091
Yes, I guess you're right.

419
00:35:05,801 --> 00:35:09,220
Well, we haven't really
met properly, have we?

420
00:35:10,014 --> 00:35:11,347
Why, no.

421
00:35:11,557 --> 00:35:14,267
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

422
00:35:14,435 --> 00:35:17,645
- Very well, thank you.
- Oh, I'm not feeling at all well.

423
00:35:17,813 --> 00:35:22,816
It's very tedious being stuck up here
all day long with a pole up your back.

424
00:35:22,984 --> 00:35:27,112
Oh, dear. That must be terribly
uncomfortable. Can't you get down?

425
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,823
Down? No, you see, I'm...
Well, I'm...

426
00:35:29,991 --> 00:35:32,075
Oh, well, here. Let me help you.

427
00:35:32,243 --> 00:35:35,245
Oh, that's very kind of you.
Very kind.

428
00:35:37,081 --> 00:35:38,498
Oh, dear. I don't see...

429
00:35:38,958 --> 00:35:42,252
Of course, I'm not bright
about doing things...

430
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:46,882
...but if you'll just bend the nail down,
maybe I'll slip off and...

431
00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:48,967
Oh, yes!

432
00:35:49,218 --> 00:35:50,385
Whoops!

433
00:35:50,845 --> 00:35:53,472
- There goes some of me again!
- Does it hurt you?

434
00:35:53,639 --> 00:35:57,893
Oh, no. I just keep picking it up
and putting it back in again.

435
00:35:58,061 --> 00:36:00,187
My! It's good to be free!

436
00:36:02,398 --> 00:36:03,732
Did I scare you?

437
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:07,194
No, no. I just thought
you hurt yourself.

438
00:36:07,362 --> 00:36:10,447
- But I didn't scare you?
- No, of course not.

439
00:36:10,656 --> 00:36:12,157
I didn't think so.

440
00:36:13,534 --> 00:36:14,868
Boo! Scat! Boo!

441
00:36:18,581 --> 00:36:21,500
You see? I can't even scare a crow.

442
00:36:21,667 --> 00:36:26,046
They come from miles around just to eat
in my field and laugh in my face.

443
00:36:26,214 --> 00:36:29,716
Oh, I'm a failure, because
I haven't got a brain!

444
00:36:30,051 --> 00:36:33,011
Well, what would you do
with a brain if you had one?

445
00:36:33,178 --> 00:36:35,262
Do? Why, if I had a brain, I could...

446
00:36:36,139 --> 00:36:40,142
I could while away the hours
Conferring with the flowers

447
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:42,895
Consulting with the rain

448
00:36:43,772 --> 00:36:47,316
And my head I'd be scratchin'
While my thoughts were busy hatchin'

449
00:36:47,484 --> 00:36:50,152
If I only had a brain

450
00:36:51,196 --> 00:36:55,116
I'd unravel every riddle
For any individ'le

451
00:36:55,283 --> 00:36:57,743
In trouble or in pain

452
00:36:58,870 --> 00:37:02,415
With the thoughts you'd be thinkin'
You could be another Lincoln

453
00:37:02,582 --> 00:37:06,168
If you only had a brain

454
00:37:06,336 --> 00:37:10,214
Oh, I could tell you why

455
00:37:10,382 --> 00:37:13,717
The ocean's near the shore

456
00:37:13,885 --> 00:37:17,221
I could think of things
I never thunk before

457
00:37:17,389 --> 00:37:21,142
And then I'd sit
And think some more

458
00:37:21,309 --> 00:37:25,104
I would not be just a nothin'
My head all full of stuffin'

459
00:37:25,272 --> 00:37:28,232
My heart all full of pain

460
00:37:28,942 --> 00:37:32,319
I would dance and be merry
Life would be a ding-a-derry

461
00:37:32,487 --> 00:37:34,947
If I only had a brain

462
00:37:35,115 --> 00:37:36,782
Whoa!

463
00:37:38,452 --> 00:37:39,994
Wonderful!

464
00:37:40,162 --> 00:37:42,997
Why, if our scarecrow back in Kansas
could do that...

465
00:37:43,165 --> 00:37:46,166
...the crows would be scared to pieces!
- They would?

466
00:37:46,333 --> 00:37:48,668
- Where's Kansas?
- That's where I live.

467
00:37:48,836 --> 00:37:51,796
I wanna get back there so badly,
I'm going to Emerald City...

468
00:37:51,964 --> 00:37:54,048
...to get the Wizard of Oz to help me.

469
00:37:54,216 --> 00:37:56,634
- You're going to see a wizard?
- Mm-hmm.

470
00:37:57,303 --> 00:38:00,472
Do you think if I went,
this wizard would give me brains?

471
00:38:00,639 --> 00:38:02,515
I couldn't say.

472
00:38:02,683 --> 00:38:06,686
But even if he didn't, you'd be
no worse off than you are now.

473
00:38:06,854 --> 00:38:09,355
- Yes, that's true.
- But maybe you better not.

474
00:38:09,523 --> 00:38:12,025
I've got a witch mad at me,
and you might get into trouble.

475
00:38:12,193 --> 00:38:17,280
Witch? I'm not afraid of a witch!
I'm not afraid of anything!

476
00:38:18,824 --> 00:38:22,035
- Except a lighted match.
- I don't blame you for that.

477
00:38:22,203 --> 00:38:26,331
But I'd face a whole box of them
for the chance of getting some brains.

478
00:38:28,167 --> 00:38:30,960
Look, I won't be any trouble,
because I don't eat a thing.

479
00:38:31,128 --> 00:38:35,006
And I won't try to manage things,
because I can't think.

480
00:38:35,174 --> 00:38:36,591
Won't you take me with you?

481
00:38:37,551 --> 00:38:39,010
Why, of course I will!

482
00:38:39,845 --> 00:38:42,639
Hooray! We're off to see a wizard!

483
00:38:42,806 --> 00:38:45,225
You're not starting out very well.

484
00:38:45,392 --> 00:38:47,519
Oh, I'll try! Really, I will.

485
00:38:47,686 --> 00:38:48,895
- To Oz?
- To Oz!

486
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:51,731
We're off to see the Wizard

487
00:38:51,899 --> 00:38:53,525
The wonderful Wizard of Oz

488
00:38:53,692 --> 00:38:57,111
We hear he is a whiz of a wiz
If ever a wiz there was

489
00:38:57,279 --> 00:39:00,739
If ever, oh ever a wiz there was
The Wizard of Oz is one because

490
00:39:00,907 --> 00:39:04,284
Because, because, because
Because, because

491
00:39:04,452 --> 00:39:07,204
Because of the wonderful things he does

492
00:39:08,039 --> 00:39:14,336
We're off to see the wizard
The wonderful Wizard of Oz

493
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:26,598
Oh.

494
00:39:27,392 --> 00:39:29,560
Apples!

495
00:39:29,894 --> 00:39:32,521
Oh, look!

496
00:39:34,148 --> 00:39:35,691
Oh!

497
00:39:38,653 --> 00:39:39,695
Ouch!

498
00:39:40,154 --> 00:39:42,072
What do you think you're doing?

499
00:39:43,866 --> 00:39:47,619
We've been walking a long ways
and I was hungry and...

500
00:39:48,037 --> 00:39:49,371
Did you say something?

501
00:39:49,539 --> 00:39:51,540
- She was hungry!
She was hungry!

502
00:39:51,708 --> 00:39:55,752
How would like to have someone come
along and pick something off of you?

503
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:00,257
Oh, dear! I keep forgetting
I'm not in Kansas.

504
00:40:00,425 --> 00:40:01,967
Come along, Dorothy.

505
00:40:02,135 --> 00:40:04,428
You don't want any of those apples.
Hmm.

506
00:40:04,596 --> 00:40:06,722
Are you hinting my apples aren't
what they ought to be?

507
00:40:06,889 --> 00:40:10,641
Oh, no! It's just that she doesn't
like little green worms.

508
00:40:10,809 --> 00:40:11,976
Oh, you!

509
00:40:16,815 --> 00:40:19,066
I'll show you how to get apples.

510
00:40:21,278 --> 00:40:22,820
Oh! Oh!

511
00:40:25,407 --> 00:40:29,285
Hooray! I guess that did it. Help yourself.

512
00:40:53,769 --> 00:40:56,354
Why, it's a man!

513
00:40:57,105 --> 00:40:59,940
A man made out of tin!

514
00:41:00,108 --> 00:41:02,109
Yes!

515
00:41:02,903 --> 00:41:04,487
Look!

516
00:41:08,283 --> 00:41:09,992
Did you say something?

517
00:41:12,371 --> 00:41:13,996
He said "oilcan. "

518
00:41:14,164 --> 00:41:17,833
- Oil can what?
- Oilcan?

519
00:41:18,794 --> 00:41:21,170
Oh, here it is.

520
00:41:22,089 --> 00:41:23,838
Where do you want to be oiled first?

521
00:41:25,841 --> 00:41:27,717
He said his mouth.

522
00:41:31,305 --> 00:41:33,014
The other side.

523
00:41:40,731 --> 00:41:43,191
Mm... Mm... Mm...

524
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:46,319
My goodness! I can talk again! Oh!

525
00:41:46,487 --> 00:41:50,281
Oil my arms, please. Oil my elbows.

526
00:41:50,449 --> 00:41:51,866
Here.

527
00:41:55,204 --> 00:41:58,790
- Did that hurt?
- No, it feels wonderful.

528
00:41:58,958 --> 00:42:01,334
I've held that axe up for ages.

529
00:42:01,502 --> 00:42:06,172
Goodness!
How did you ever get like this?

530
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:08,842
Well, about a year ago...

531
00:42:09,009 --> 00:42:10,802
...I was chopping that tree...

532
00:42:10,970 --> 00:42:12,846
...when suddenly it began to rain.

533
00:42:13,013 --> 00:42:17,016
And right in the middle of a chop,
I rusted solid.

534
00:42:17,184 --> 00:42:19,894
And I've been that way ever since.

535
00:42:22,523 --> 00:42:24,607
Well, you're perfect now.

536
00:42:24,775 --> 00:42:26,693
My neck. My neck.

537
00:42:26,861 --> 00:42:28,236
Perfect?

538
00:42:28,404 --> 00:42:31,239
Bang on my chest
if you think I'm perfect.

539
00:42:31,407 --> 00:42:33,700
Go ahead, bang on it!

540
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:38,370
Beautiful! What an echo!

541
00:42:38,538 --> 00:42:40,456
It's empty.

542
00:42:41,082 --> 00:42:44,460
The tinsmith forgot to give me a heart.

543
00:42:44,753 --> 00:42:46,670
- No heart?
- No heart?

544
00:42:46,838 --> 00:42:48,505
No heart.

545
00:42:48,673 --> 00:42:50,924
All hollow.

546
00:42:54,554 --> 00:42:56,972
When a man's an empty kettle

547
00:42:57,140 --> 00:42:59,433
He should be on his mettle

548
00:42:59,601 --> 00:43:03,270
And yet I'm torn apart

549
00:43:03,855 --> 00:43:08,317
Just because I'm presumin'
That I could be kind of human

550
00:43:08,485 --> 00:43:11,612
If I only had a heart

551
00:43:12,947 --> 00:43:17,785
I'd be tender, I'd be gentle
And awful sentimental

552
00:43:17,952 --> 00:43:21,205
Regarding love and art

553
00:43:22,081 --> 00:43:26,627
I'd be friends with the sparrows
And the boy who shoots the arrows

554
00:43:26,795 --> 00:43:30,923
If I only had a heart

555
00:43:31,466 --> 00:43:35,928
Picture me
A balcony

556
00:43:36,095 --> 00:43:40,557
Above, a voice sings low

557
00:43:40,725 --> 00:43:44,520
Wherefore art thou, Romeo?

558
00:43:44,687 --> 00:43:46,688
I hear a beat

559
00:43:47,899 --> 00:43:49,190
How sweet!

560
00:43:49,358 --> 00:43:54,278
Just to register emotion
Jealousy, devotion

561
00:43:54,446 --> 00:43:58,157
And really feel the part

562
00:43:58,575 --> 00:44:04,205
I could stay young and chipper
And I'd lock it with a zipper

563
00:44:04,373 --> 00:44:07,834
If I only had a heart

564
00:45:29,457 --> 00:45:31,499
Oh! Oh, oh, oh, oh!

565
00:45:31,667 --> 00:45:34,502
- Are you all right?
- I'm a little rusty yet.

566
00:45:34,670 --> 00:45:36,630
Oh, dear!

567
00:45:36,797 --> 00:45:39,090
That was wonderful!

568
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:43,386
You know, we were wondering
why you couldn't come with us...

569
00:45:43,554 --> 00:45:46,681
...to the Emerald City
to ask the Wizard of Oz for a heart.

570
00:45:47,016 --> 00:45:49,726
Suppose the Wizard wouldn't
give me one when we got there.

571
00:45:49,894 --> 00:45:51,436
Oh, but he will!

572
00:45:51,604 --> 00:45:52,979
He must!

573
00:45:53,147 --> 00:45:55,649
We've come such a long way already.

574
00:46:01,781 --> 00:46:05,867
You call that long?
Why, you've just begun!

575
00:46:06,035 --> 00:46:09,537
Helping the little lady along,
are you, my fine gentlemen?

576
00:46:09,705 --> 00:46:11,957
Well, stay away from her...

577
00:46:12,124 --> 00:46:14,208
...or I'll stuff a mattress with you!

578
00:46:15,293 --> 00:46:16,585
And you!

579
00:46:16,753 --> 00:46:19,546
I'll use you for a beehive!

580
00:46:19,714 --> 00:46:23,133
Here, scarecrow. Wanna play ball?

581
00:46:26,888 --> 00:46:30,307
Fire! I'm burning! I'm burning!

582
00:46:42,237 --> 00:46:43,862
I'm not afraid of her.

583
00:46:44,030 --> 00:46:47,700
I'll see you get safely to the Wizard,
whether I get a brain or not!

584
00:46:47,867 --> 00:46:49,201
Stuff a mattress with me!

585
00:46:51,246 --> 00:46:54,206
I'll see you reach the Wizard,
whether I get a heart or not.

586
00:46:54,374 --> 00:46:56,166
Beehive! Bah!

587
00:46:56,334 --> 00:46:59,670
Let her try and make
a beehive out of me.

588
00:47:01,047 --> 00:47:04,925
Oh, you're the best friends
anybody ever had.

589
00:47:05,093 --> 00:47:09,513
And it's funny, but I feel as if
I've known you all the time.

590
00:47:09,681 --> 00:47:12,850
- But I couldn't have, could I?
- I don't see how.

591
00:47:13,018 --> 00:47:16,353
You weren't around when I was
stuffed and sewn together, were you?

592
00:47:16,521 --> 00:47:20,274
And I was standing over there
rusting for the longest time.

593
00:47:20,442 --> 00:47:23,152
Still, I wish I could remember.

594
00:47:23,319 --> 00:47:27,739
But I guess it doesn't matter anyway.
We know each other now, don't we?

595
00:47:27,990 --> 00:47:30,074
- That's right.
- We do.

596
00:47:30,242 --> 00:47:31,993
- To Oz?
- To Oz!

597
00:47:32,161 --> 00:47:33,995
We're off to see the Wizard

598
00:47:34,163 --> 00:47:35,997
The wonderful Wizard of Oz

599
00:47:36,165 --> 00:47:39,417
We hear he is a whiz of a wiz
If ever a wiz there was

600
00:47:39,585 --> 00:47:42,879
If ever, oh ever a wiz there was
The Wizard of Oz is one because

601
00:47:43,047 --> 00:47:46,424
Because, because, because
Because, because

602
00:47:46,592 --> 00:47:49,427
Because of the wonderful things he does

603
00:47:50,054 --> 00:47:56,934
We're off to see the Wizard
The wonderful Wizard of Oz

604
00:48:18,290 --> 00:48:21,042
I don't like this forest.

605
00:48:21,585 --> 00:48:24,712
It's dark and creepy.

606
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:30,301
Of course, I don't know, but I think
it'll get darker before it gets lighter.

607
00:48:30,636 --> 00:48:31,761
Do...

608
00:48:31,929 --> 00:48:34,680
Do you suppose we'll meet
any wild animals?

609
00:48:34,848 --> 00:48:36,474
We might.

610
00:48:36,642 --> 00:48:40,227
Animals that eat straw?

611
00:48:40,394 --> 00:48:43,855
Some, but mostly lions
and tigers and bears.

612
00:48:44,023 --> 00:48:45,482
- Lions!
- And tigers?

613
00:48:45,650 --> 00:48:47,317
And bears!

614
00:48:47,944 --> 00:48:51,363
Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh, my!

615
00:48:51,531 --> 00:48:55,242
Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh, my!

616
00:48:55,409 --> 00:49:02,541
Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh, my!

617
00:49:05,545 --> 00:49:06,837
Oh!

618
00:49:27,233 --> 00:49:30,485
Put 'em up! Put 'em up!

619
00:49:30,695 --> 00:49:32,362
Which one of you first?

620
00:49:32,530 --> 00:49:34,906
I'll fight you both together,
if you want.

621
00:49:35,074 --> 00:49:38,326
I'll fight you with
one paw tied behind my back!

622
00:49:38,661 --> 00:49:40,704
I'll fight you standing on one foot!

623
00:49:40,913 --> 00:49:43,373
I'll fight you with my eyes closed!

624
00:49:43,791 --> 00:49:46,668
Oh, pulling an ax on me, eh?

625
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:51,088
Sneaking up on me, eh? Why...

626
00:49:52,591 --> 00:49:55,801
- Here, here. Go away and let us alone.
- Oh, scared, huh?

627
00:49:55,969 --> 00:49:57,386
Afraid, huh?

628
00:49:57,971 --> 00:49:59,763
How long can you stay fresh
in that can?

629
00:50:01,433 --> 00:50:06,187
Come on, get up and fight,
you shivering junkyard.

630
00:50:06,479 --> 00:50:09,315
Put your hands up,
you lopsided bag of hay!

631
00:50:09,482 --> 00:50:11,066
That's getting personal, Lion.

632
00:50:11,818 --> 00:50:14,153
Yes, get up and teach him a lesson.

633
00:50:14,321 --> 00:50:16,739
What's wrong with you teaching him?

634
00:50:16,907 --> 00:50:18,866
Well, I hardly know him.

635
00:50:20,827 --> 00:50:22,661
Well, I'll get you anyway, peewee.

636
00:50:33,215 --> 00:50:34,256
Shame on you!

637
00:50:35,634 --> 00:50:38,552
What did you do that for?
I didn't bite him.

638
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:40,638
No, but you tried to.

639
00:50:40,805 --> 00:50:44,516
It's bad enough picking on a straw man,
but picking on poor little dogs...

640
00:50:44,684 --> 00:50:48,312
Well, you didn't have to go
and hit me, did you?

641
00:50:48,939 --> 00:50:50,648
Is my nose bleeding?

642
00:50:50,815 --> 00:50:53,234
Well, of course not.

643
00:50:54,694 --> 00:50:57,112
My goodness,
what a fuss you're making!

644
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:01,617
Well, naturally, when you go around
picking on things weaker than you are...

645
00:51:01,785 --> 00:51:03,534
You're nothing but a big coward!

646
00:51:03,702 --> 00:51:06,162
You're right, I am a coward!

647
00:51:07,289 --> 00:51:09,707
I haven't any courage at all.

648
00:51:09,875 --> 00:51:12,627
I even scare myself!

649
00:51:13,462 --> 00:51:15,588
Look at the circles under my eyes.

650
00:51:15,756 --> 00:51:17,548
I haven't slept in weeks.

651
00:51:17,716 --> 00:51:19,676
Why don't you try counting sheep?

652
00:51:19,843 --> 00:51:23,513
That doesn't do any good.
I'm afraid of them.

653
00:51:24,390 --> 00:51:26,641
Oh, that's too bad.

654
00:51:27,101 --> 00:51:29,519
Don't you think the Wizard
could help him too?

655
00:51:29,687 --> 00:51:31,771
I don't see why not.

656
00:51:31,939 --> 00:51:33,314
Come along with us.

657
00:51:33,482 --> 00:51:36,401
We're on our way to see the Wizard.
To get him a heart.

658
00:51:36,568 --> 00:51:39,737
- And him a brain.
- He could give you some courage.

659
00:51:40,489 --> 00:51:45,326
Wouldn't you feel degraded to be seen
in the company of a cowardly lion?

660
00:51:45,494 --> 00:51:47,036
I would.

661
00:51:47,579 --> 00:51:49,497
No, of course not.

662
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:53,626
Gee, that's awfully nice of you.

663
00:51:53,794 --> 00:51:57,463
- My life has been simply unbearable.
- Oh.

664
00:51:57,631 --> 00:51:59,674
Well, it's all right now.

665
00:51:59,842 --> 00:52:02,176
The Wizard'll fix everything.

666
00:52:02,344 --> 00:52:05,179
It's been in me so long.

667
00:52:05,347 --> 00:52:07,682
I just gotta tell you how I feel.

668
00:52:08,267 --> 00:52:09,684
Well, come on!

669
00:52:10,352 --> 00:52:12,729
Yeah, it's sad,
Believe me, missy

670
00:52:12,896 --> 00:52:14,564
When you're born to be a sissy

671
00:52:14,732 --> 00:52:17,441
Without the vim and verve

672
00:52:18,401 --> 00:52:22,321
But I could show my prowess
Be a lion, not a mouse

673
00:52:22,488 --> 00:52:25,240
If I only had the nerve

674
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:30,454
I'm afraid there's no denyin'
I'm just a dandy lion

675
00:52:30,621 --> 00:52:33,165
A fate I don't deserve

676
00:52:34,208 --> 00:52:38,128
- I'd be brave as a blizzard
- I'd be gentle as a lizard

677
00:52:38,296 --> 00:52:40,130
I'd be clever as a gizzard

678
00:52:40,298 --> 00:52:45,594
If the Wizard is a wizard
Who will serve

679
00:52:45,762 --> 00:52:47,596
Then I'm sure to get a brain

680
00:52:47,764 --> 00:52:49,723
- A heart
- A home

681
00:52:49,891 --> 00:52:51,433
The nerve!

682
00:52:51,809 --> 00:52:53,393
Oh

683
00:52:53,561 --> 00:52:56,813
We're off to see the Wizard
The wonderful Wizard of Oz

684
00:52:56,981 --> 00:53:00,567
We hear he is a whiz of a wiz
If ever a wiz there was

685
00:53:00,735 --> 00:53:03,779
If ever, oh ever a wiz there was
The Wizard of Oz is one because

686
00:53:03,946 --> 00:53:07,282
Because, because, because
Because, because

687
00:53:07,450 --> 00:53:10,494
Because of the wonderful things he does

688
00:53:10,953 --> 00:53:15,957
We're off to see the Wizard
The wonderful Wizard of Oz

689
00:53:23,716 --> 00:53:26,259
So you won't take warning, eh?

690
00:53:26,427 --> 00:53:28,260
All the worse for you, then.

691
00:53:28,428 --> 00:53:32,139
I'll take care of you now
instead of later!

692
00:53:34,976 --> 00:53:37,228
When I gain those ruby slippers...

693
00:53:37,396 --> 00:53:40,773
...my power will be the greatest in Oz!

694
00:53:41,650 --> 00:53:43,943
And now, my beauties...

695
00:53:44,111 --> 00:53:47,321
...something with poison in it, I think.

696
00:53:47,489 --> 00:53:49,657
With poison in it.

697
00:53:49,825 --> 00:53:55,413
But attractive to the eye
and soothing to the smell!

698
00:53:56,832 --> 00:53:58,624
Poppies.

699
00:53:58,875 --> 00:54:01,085
Poppies!

700
00:54:01,253 --> 00:54:04,672
Poppies will put them to sleep.

701
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:06,966
Sleep...

702
00:54:07,134 --> 00:54:10,928
Now they'll sleep.

703
00:54:39,791 --> 00:54:41,374
There's Emerald City!

704
00:54:41,542 --> 00:54:45,211
Oh, we're almost there!
At last! At last!

705
00:54:45,379 --> 00:54:49,424
It's beautiful, isn't it?
Just like I knew it would be.

706
00:54:49,592 --> 00:54:52,802
He really must be a wonderful wizard
to live in a city like that.

707
00:54:53,053 --> 00:54:54,971
Come on, what are we waiting for?

708
00:54:55,139 --> 00:54:58,266
Nothing! Let's hurry!
Yes, let's run!

709
00:55:02,855 --> 00:55:05,148
- Come on! Come on!
- Hurry! Hurry!

710
00:55:09,236 --> 00:55:10,945
Oh, look!

711
00:55:11,113 --> 00:55:13,281
Come on! Come on!

712
00:55:13,449 --> 00:55:15,658
Look at the scenery. It's wonderful!

713
00:55:15,826 --> 00:55:17,368
Emerald City!

714
00:55:21,665 --> 00:55:24,584
Oh. What's happening?

715
00:55:24,752 --> 00:55:26,503
What is it?

716
00:55:26,712 --> 00:55:28,838
I can't run anymore.

717
00:55:29,006 --> 00:55:32,258
- I'm so sleepy.
- Give us your hands and we'll pull you.

718
00:55:32,426 --> 00:55:35,887
Oh, no, please.
I have to rest for just a minute.

719
00:55:36,055 --> 00:55:38,598
Toto. Where's Toto?

720
00:55:38,807 --> 00:55:41,226
You can't rest now.
We're nearly there.

721
00:55:43,729 --> 00:55:45,897
Don't cry.
You'll rust yourself again!

722
00:55:46,065 --> 00:55:49,984
Coming to think of it,
forty winks wouldn't be bad.

723
00:55:50,152 --> 00:55:52,820
- Don't you start it too!
- No!

724
00:55:52,988 --> 00:55:54,571
We ought to carry Dorothy.

725
00:55:54,739 --> 00:55:56,782
I don't think I could,
but we could try.

726
00:55:56,950 --> 00:55:58,909
- Let's.
- Yes.

727
00:55:59,452 --> 00:56:03,872
- Now look at him. This is terrible!
- Here, Tin Man, help me.

728
00:56:05,875 --> 00:56:08,669
Oh, this is terrible!
I can't budge her an inch.

729
00:56:08,836 --> 00:56:10,462
This is a spell, this is!

730
00:56:10,630 --> 00:56:13,590
It's the Wicked Witch! What'll we do?

731
00:56:13,758 --> 00:56:16,218
Help! Help!

732
00:56:16,386 --> 00:56:18,554
It's no use screaming
at a time like this.

733
00:56:18,721 --> 00:56:21,682
Nobody will hear you!
Help! Help!

734
00:56:21,891 --> 00:56:23,892
Help!

735
00:56:27,730 --> 00:56:29,189
It's snowing!

736
00:56:30,733 --> 00:56:33,026
No, it isn't.

737
00:56:33,444 --> 00:56:35,779
Yes, it is!

738
00:56:36,155 --> 00:56:37,781
Maybe that'll help!

739
00:56:38,741 --> 00:56:40,909
Oh, but it couldn't help!

740
00:56:41,578 --> 00:56:45,914
It does help!
Dorothy, you're waking up!

741
00:56:46,457 --> 00:56:48,667
Oh. Oh.

742
00:56:52,171 --> 00:56:55,007
Unusual weather we're having,
ain't it?

743
00:56:55,633 --> 00:56:58,802
Look! He's rusted again.

744
00:56:59,387 --> 00:57:02,556
- Oh, give me the oilcan, quick!
Here.

745
00:57:03,391 --> 00:57:04,725
- He is rusted.
Here.

746
00:57:04,892 --> 00:57:08,603
Here.
Quick! Oh! Oh!

747
00:57:08,770 --> 00:57:10,313
Curses! Curses!

748
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:12,773
Somebody always helps that girl.

749
00:57:14,818 --> 00:57:18,696
But shoes or no shoes,
I'm still great enough to conquer her.

750
00:57:18,864 --> 00:57:20,448
And woe to those who try to stop me!

751
00:57:20,741 --> 00:57:23,075
Come on, let's get out of here.

752
00:57:23,243 --> 00:57:25,578
Look! Emerald City is closer
and prettier than ever!

753
00:57:25,746 --> 00:57:27,538
You're out of the woods

754
00:57:27,706 --> 00:57:30,124
You're out of the dark
You're out of the night

755
00:57:30,292 --> 00:57:34,170
Step into the sun
Step into the light

756
00:57:34,338 --> 00:57:37,465
Keep straight ahead for
The most glorious place

757
00:57:37,633 --> 00:57:42,219
On the face of the earth
Or the sky

758
00:57:42,387 --> 00:57:44,180
Hold on to your breath
Hold on to your heart

759
00:57:44,348 --> 00:57:46,390
Hold on to your hope

760
00:57:46,558 --> 00:57:50,019
March up to the gate
And bid it open

761
00:57:55,359 --> 00:57:58,819
To the Emerald City,
as fast as lightning!

762
00:58:08,914 --> 00:58:10,706
You're out of the woods

763
00:58:10,874 --> 00:58:13,167
You're out of the dark
You're out of the night

764
00:58:13,335 --> 00:58:15,252
Step into the sun
Step into the light

765
00:58:15,420 --> 00:58:18,130
March up to the gate
And bid it...

766
00:58:18,297 --> 00:58:20,215
...open

767
00:58:20,424 --> 00:58:22,342
Open

768
00:58:27,598 --> 00:58:29,641
Who rang that bell?

769
00:58:29,809 --> 00:58:31,726
We did!
- Can't you read?

770
00:58:31,894 --> 00:58:34,145
- Read what?
- The notice!

771
00:58:34,313 --> 00:58:36,189
What notice?
- It's on the door!

772
00:58:36,399 --> 00:58:39,818
As plain as the nose on my face!

773
00:58:40,027 --> 00:58:41,361
Oh... Uh...

774
00:58:41,696 --> 00:58:44,030
Oh! Tsk, tsk, tsk.

775
00:58:48,369 --> 00:58:52,372
"Bell out of order. Please knock. "

776
00:58:53,958 --> 00:58:56,334
Well! That's more like it!

777
00:58:56,502 --> 00:58:58,336
Now, state your business.

778
00:58:58,504 --> 00:59:01,131
We wanna see the Wizard.

779
00:59:02,216 --> 00:59:03,967
The Wizard?

780
00:59:04,135 --> 00:59:06,720
But nobody can see the great Oz.

781
00:59:06,887 --> 00:59:11,099
Nobody's ever seen the great Oz!
Even I've never seen him!

782
00:59:11,267 --> 00:59:13,768
Well, then, how do you know
there is one?

783
00:59:14,061 --> 00:59:15,937
Because he's...

784
00:59:16,105 --> 00:59:19,691
Oh! You're wasting my time!

785
00:59:19,859 --> 00:59:23,862
Oh, please. Please, sir.
I've got to see the Wizard.

786
00:59:24,029 --> 00:59:27,407
- The Good Witch of the North sent me.
- Prove it!

787
00:59:27,616 --> 00:59:30,826
She's wearing the ruby slippers
that she gave her.

788
00:59:33,997 --> 00:59:39,001
Oh! So she is!
Well, bust my buttons!

789
00:59:39,169 --> 00:59:41,628
Why didn't you say that
in the first place?

790
00:59:41,796 --> 00:59:44,047
That's a horse of a different color!

791
00:59:44,215 --> 00:59:46,717
Come on in!

792
00:59:57,812 --> 00:59:59,313
Cabby! Cabby!

793
00:59:59,481 --> 01:00:03,400
Just what you're looking for.
Take you any place in the city, we does.

794
01:00:03,735 --> 01:00:08,655
- Would you take us to see the Wizard?
- The Wizard? The Wizard?

795
01:00:09,991 --> 01:00:13,076
Yes, of course. But first I'll
take you to a little place...

796
01:00:13,244 --> 01:00:17,080
...where you can tidy up a bit.
- Oh, thank you so much!

797
01:00:17,248 --> 01:00:22,002
We've been gone such a long time,
and we feel so mess...

798
01:00:22,337 --> 01:00:26,590
What kind of a horse is that?
I've never seen a horse like that before!

799
01:00:26,758 --> 01:00:30,719
No, and never will again, I fancy.
There's only one of him, and he's it.

800
01:00:30,887 --> 01:00:34,681
He's the horse of a different color
you've heard tell about.

801
01:00:35,016 --> 01:00:36,725
Ha-ha-ha! Ho-ho-ho!

802
01:00:36,893 --> 01:00:38,769
And a couple of tra-la-las

803
01:00:38,937 --> 01:00:43,232
That's how we laugh the day away
In the merry old land of Oz

804
01:00:43,398 --> 01:00:45,066
Bzz, bzz, bzz!
Chirp, chirp, chirp!

805
01:00:45,234 --> 01:00:47,109
And a couple of la-di-das

806
01:00:47,277 --> 01:00:51,072
That's how the crickets crick all day
In the merry old land of Oz

807
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:55,284
We get up at twelve
And start to work at one

808
01:00:55,452 --> 01:00:58,579
Take an hour for lunch
And then at two we're done

809
01:00:58,747 --> 01:00:59,789
Jolly good fun!

810
01:00:59,957 --> 01:01:01,582
Ha-ha-ha!
Ho-ho-ho!

811
01:01:01,750 --> 01:01:03,709
And a couple of tra-la-las

812
01:01:03,877 --> 01:01:07,922
That's how we laugh the day away
In the merry old land of Oz

813
01:01:08,090 --> 01:01:10,091
Ha-ha-ha!
Ho-ho-ho!

814
01:01:10,259 --> 01:01:11,884
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

815
01:01:12,052 --> 01:01:14,262
That's how we laugh the day away
With a

816
01:01:14,429 --> 01:01:16,138
Ho-ho-ho!
Ha-ha-ha!

817
01:01:16,306 --> 01:01:18,474
In the merry old land of Oz

818
01:01:18,642 --> 01:01:20,393
Pat, pat here
Pat, pat there

819
01:01:20,561 --> 01:01:22,436
And a couple of brand-new straws

820
01:01:22,604 --> 01:01:26,983
That's how we keep you young and fair
In the merry old land of Oz

821
01:01:27,150 --> 01:01:29,110
Rub, rub here
Rub, rub there

822
01:01:29,278 --> 01:01:30,945
Whether you're tin or bronze

823
01:01:31,113 --> 01:01:34,866
That's how we keep you in repair
In the merry old land of Oz

824
01:01:35,033 --> 01:01:39,078
We can make a dimpled smile
Out of a frown

825
01:01:39,246 --> 01:01:41,831
Can you even dye my eyes
To match my gown?

826
01:01:41,999 --> 01:01:43,749
- Uh-huh
Jolly old town!

827
01:01:43,917 --> 01:01:45,751
Clip, clip here
Clip, clip there

828
01:01:45,919 --> 01:01:47,753
We give the roughest claws

829
01:01:47,921 --> 01:01:52,508
That certain air of savoir-faire
In the merry old land of Oz

830
01:01:56,137 --> 01:01:59,973
That's how we laugh the day away
In the merry old land of Oz

831
01:02:00,141 --> 01:02:03,310
That's how we laugh the day away
With a ha-ha-ha

832
01:02:08,107 --> 01:02:10,609
In the merry old land of Oz

833
01:02:28,544 --> 01:02:30,128
Who's her? Who's her?

834
01:02:30,296 --> 01:02:33,089
It's the witch!
She's followed us here!

835
01:02:33,257 --> 01:02:35,508
"Surrender, Dorothy. "

836
01:02:37,011 --> 01:02:38,678
Dorothy? Who's Dorothy?

837
01:02:38,846 --> 01:02:41,598
- The Wizard will explain it!
- To the Wizard!

838
01:02:41,807 --> 01:02:44,017
Dear! Whatever shall we do?

839
01:02:44,185 --> 01:02:46,978
We better hurry if we're
gonna see the Wizard!

840
01:02:48,773 --> 01:02:52,233
Here! Here, here!
Everything is all right.

841
01:02:52,401 --> 01:02:54,235
Stop that now, just...

842
01:02:54,403 --> 01:02:56,905
It's all right!
Everything is all right!

843
01:02:57,073 --> 01:03:01,534
The great and powerful Oz
has got matters well in hand.

844
01:03:01,702 --> 01:03:03,036
I hope.

845
01:03:03,204 --> 01:03:06,539
So you can all go home!
There's nothing to worry about!

846
01:03:06,707 --> 01:03:10,125
Get out of here. Now go on!
Go on home.

847
01:03:10,502 --> 01:03:12,169
Go home.

848
01:03:12,879 --> 01:03:16,090
We want to see the Wizard right away.
All four of us.

849
01:03:16,257 --> 01:03:20,970
Orders are, nobody can see
the great Oz! Not nobody, not nohow!

850
01:03:21,137 --> 01:03:23,722
But, please! It's very important.

851
01:03:23,890 --> 01:03:26,100
I got a permanent
just for the occasion.

852
01:03:26,267 --> 01:03:28,852
Not nobody, not nohow!

853
01:03:29,020 --> 01:03:30,437
But she's Dorothy!

854
01:03:31,022 --> 01:03:33,691
The witch's Dorothy?

855
01:03:34,859 --> 01:03:36,652
Well, that makes a difference.

856
01:03:36,820 --> 01:03:41,907
Just wait here.
I'll announce you at once.

857
01:03:45,662 --> 01:03:48,122
Did you hear that?
He'll announce us at once.

858
01:03:48,289 --> 01:03:51,500
- I've as good as got my brain.
- I can fairly hear my heart beating.

859
01:03:51,668 --> 01:03:53,002
I'll be home for supper.

860
01:03:53,169 --> 01:03:55,796
In another hour,
I'll be king of the forest.

861
01:03:55,964 --> 01:03:59,174
Long live the king!

862
01:04:06,391 --> 01:04:11,520
If I were king of the forest

863
01:04:11,688 --> 01:04:13,188
Not queen

864
01:04:13,356 --> 01:04:14,815
Not duke

865
01:04:14,983 --> 01:04:17,234
Not prince

866
01:04:17,652 --> 01:04:21,988
My regal robes of the forest

867
01:04:22,197 --> 01:04:23,573
Would be satin

868
01:04:23,741 --> 01:04:25,283
Not cotton

869
01:04:25,451 --> 01:04:28,453
Not chintz

870
01:04:28,620 --> 01:04:32,248
I'd command each thing
Be it fish or fowl

871
01:04:32,416 --> 01:04:33,708
With a woof!

872
01:04:33,876 --> 01:04:35,209
And a woof!

873
01:04:35,377 --> 01:04:38,463
And a royal growl

874
01:04:40,382 --> 01:04:42,925
As I'd click my heel
All the trees would kneel

875
01:04:43,093 --> 01:04:47,805
And the mountains bow
And the bulls kowtow

876
01:04:48,891 --> 01:04:55,313
And the sparrow would take wing

877
01:04:55,481 --> 01:04:57,148
If I

878
01:04:57,316 --> 01:05:03,321
If I were king

879
01:05:03,947 --> 01:05:07,700
Each rabbit would show respect to me

880
01:05:07,868 --> 01:05:11,412
The chipmunks genuflect to me

881
01:05:11,580 --> 01:05:13,331
Though my tail would lash

882
01:05:13,499 --> 01:05:15,249
I would show compash

883
01:05:15,417 --> 01:05:19,462
For every underling

884
01:05:19,630 --> 01:05:21,547
If I

885
01:05:21,715 --> 01:05:26,010
If I were king

886
01:05:26,845 --> 01:05:32,391
Just king

887
01:06:02,797 --> 01:06:08,260
Monarch of all I survey

888
01:06:08,469 --> 01:06:13,682
Monarch

889
01:06:13,850 --> 01:06:19,146
Of all I survey

890
01:06:20,982 --> 01:06:24,067
If you were king,
you wouldn't be afraid of anything?

891
01:06:24,235 --> 01:06:27,320
Not nobody, not nohow!

892
01:06:27,488 --> 01:06:29,948
- Not even a rhinoceros?
- Imposserous!

893
01:06:30,116 --> 01:06:33,952
- How about a hippopotamus?
- I'd trash him from top to "bottom-us. "

894
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:37,414
- Supposing you met an elephant?
- I'd wrap him up in "cello-phant"!

895
01:06:37,582 --> 01:06:41,209
- What if it were a brontosaurus?
- I'd show him who's king of the forest!

896
01:06:41,377 --> 01:06:43,670
How?
- How?

897
01:06:44,422 --> 01:06:45,547
Courage!

898
01:06:45,715 --> 01:06:48,716
What makes a king out of a slave?
Courage!

899
01:06:48,884 --> 01:06:53,220
What makes the flag on the mast
to wave? Courage!

900
01:06:53,388 --> 01:06:55,431
What makes the elephant
charge his tusk...

901
01:06:55,599 --> 01:06:59,018
...in the misty mist
or the dusky dusk?

902
01:06:59,186 --> 01:07:03,981
What makes the muskrat
guard his musk? Courage!

903
01:07:04,149 --> 01:07:07,151
What makes the sphinx
the Seventh Wonder? Courage!

904
01:07:07,319 --> 01:07:11,906
What makes the dawn come up
like thunder? Courage!

905
01:07:12,073 --> 01:07:13,991
What makes the Hottentot so hot?

906
01:07:14,159 --> 01:07:16,368
What puts the "ape" in apricot?

907
01:07:16,536 --> 01:07:19,079
What have they got that I ain't got?

908
01:07:19,247 --> 01:07:22,208
Courage!
- You can say that again.

909
01:07:23,251 --> 01:07:24,335
Huh?

910
01:07:26,046 --> 01:07:29,298
The Wizard says go away!

911
01:07:34,346 --> 01:07:36,722
Go away?

912
01:07:36,890 --> 01:07:40,309
Looks like we came a long way
for nothing.

913
01:07:41,937 --> 01:07:44,647
And I was so happy.

914
01:07:44,814 --> 01:07:46,899
I thought I was on my way home.

915
01:07:47,067 --> 01:07:49,735
Don't cry.
We're gonna get you to the Wizard.

916
01:07:49,903 --> 01:07:52,279
We certainly are.

917
01:07:52,906 --> 01:07:54,782
Auntie Em was so good to me...

918
01:07:54,950 --> 01:07:57,201
...and I never appreciated it.

919
01:07:57,369 --> 01:08:00,662
Running away and hurting her feelings.

920
01:08:01,038 --> 01:08:03,998
Professor Marvel said she was sick.

921
01:08:04,416 --> 01:08:06,125
She may be dying...

922
01:08:06,293 --> 01:08:08,253
...and it's all my fault.

923
01:08:11,340 --> 01:08:14,050
I'll never forgive myself.

924
01:08:14,218 --> 01:08:17,011
Never, never, never.

925
01:08:20,349 --> 01:08:23,351
Please don't cry anymore.

926
01:08:23,519 --> 01:08:26,729
I'll get you into the Wizard somehow.

927
01:08:26,897 --> 01:08:30,984
Come on.
I had an Aunt Em myself once.

928
01:08:51,380 --> 01:08:52,839
Wait a minute, fellas.

929
01:08:53,007 --> 01:08:56,801
I was just thinking, I really don't want
to see the Wizard this much.

930
01:08:56,969 --> 01:08:58,970
I better wait for you outside.

931
01:08:59,138 --> 01:09:01,973
- What's the matter?
- He's just scared again.

932
01:09:02,141 --> 01:09:04,642
Don't you know the Wizard
will give you courage?

933
01:09:04,810 --> 01:09:08,104
I'd be too scared to ask him for it.

934
01:09:08,272 --> 01:09:10,481
Well, then, we'll ask him for you.

935
01:09:10,649 --> 01:09:12,816
I'd sooner wait outside.

936
01:09:12,984 --> 01:09:14,776
Why? Why?

937
01:09:14,944 --> 01:09:18,447
Because I'm still scared!

938
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:25,537
- What happened?
- Somebody pulled my tail.

939
01:09:25,705 --> 01:09:27,748
You did it yourself.

940
01:09:28,082 --> 01:09:29,541
- Oh.
- Here.

941
01:09:29,876 --> 01:09:31,501
Come on.

942
01:09:34,672 --> 01:09:37,341
Come forward!

943
01:09:37,508 --> 01:09:39,593
Tell me when it's over!

944
01:09:50,438 --> 01:09:52,189
Look at that. Look at that!

945
01:09:56,444 --> 01:09:59,071
I wanna go home!

946
01:09:59,530 --> 01:10:02,657
I am Oz...

947
01:10:02,825 --> 01:10:05,702
...the great and powerful!

948
01:10:05,870 --> 01:10:11,083
Who are you?

949
01:10:16,547 --> 01:10:17,881
If you please...

950
01:10:18,049 --> 01:10:20,592
...I am Dorothy...

951
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:23,511
...the small and meek.

952
01:10:24,388 --> 01:10:26,055
We've come to ask you...

953
01:10:26,264 --> 01:10:28,015
- Silence!
- Oh!

954
01:10:28,558 --> 01:10:30,810
Oh! Jiminy crickets!

955
01:10:30,977 --> 01:10:33,771
The great and powerful Oz...

956
01:10:33,939 --> 01:10:36,941
...knows why you have come.

957
01:10:37,109 --> 01:10:39,193
Step forward...

958
01:10:39,361 --> 01:10:41,278
...Tin Man!

959
01:10:46,493 --> 01:10:50,663
You dare to come to me
for a heart, do you?

960
01:10:50,831 --> 01:10:53,666
You clinking, clanking, clattering...

961
01:10:53,875 --> 01:10:57,503
...collection of caliginous junk!

962
01:11:00,215 --> 01:11:02,049
Yes, sir.

963
01:11:02,217 --> 01:11:03,634
Yes, Your Honor.

964
01:11:03,802 --> 01:11:05,261
You see...

965
01:11:05,429 --> 01:11:08,931
...a while back, we were walking down
the Yellow Brick Road and...

966
01:11:09,099 --> 01:11:10,516
Quiet!

967
01:11:12,936 --> 01:11:15,146
And you, Scarecrow...

968
01:11:15,313 --> 01:11:18,649
...have the effrontery
to ask for a brain...

969
01:11:18,817 --> 01:11:23,571
...you billowing bale of bovine fodder!

970
01:11:24,739 --> 01:11:26,907
Yes, Your Honor.
I mean, Your Excellency.

971
01:11:27,075 --> 01:11:29,326
I mean, Your Wizardry!

972
01:11:29,494 --> 01:11:31,203
Enough!

973
01:11:31,997 --> 01:11:34,123
And you, Lion!

974
01:11:40,087 --> 01:11:42,172
Well?

975
01:11:48,012 --> 01:11:50,472
You ought to be ashamed
of yourself...

976
01:11:50,639 --> 01:11:53,725
...frightening him like that
when he came to you for help!

977
01:11:53,893 --> 01:11:56,519
Silence, whippersnapper!

978
01:11:56,687 --> 01:12:02,066
The beneficent Oz has every intention
of granting your requests.

979
01:12:02,234 --> 01:12:05,653
What's that? What'd he say?
Huh? What'd he say?

980
01:12:05,863 --> 01:12:09,282
But first, you must prove
yourselves worthy...

981
01:12:09,450 --> 01:12:13,244
...by performing a very small task.

982
01:12:14,205 --> 01:12:17,916
Bring me the broomstick
of the Witch of the West.

983
01:12:18,083 --> 01:12:21,211
But if we do that,
we'll have to kill her to get it.

984
01:12:21,378 --> 01:12:23,838
Bring me her broomstick...

985
01:12:24,006 --> 01:12:27,008
...and I'll grant your requests.

986
01:12:27,176 --> 01:12:29,802
Now go!

987
01:12:29,970 --> 01:12:32,263
But what if she kills us first?

988
01:12:32,431 --> 01:12:33,723
I said go!

989
01:13:19,602 --> 01:13:23,897
"I'd turn back if I were you. "

990
01:13:54,012 --> 01:13:56,597
I believe there's spooks around here.

991
01:13:56,764 --> 01:14:00,100
That's ridiculous!
Spooks. That's silly.

992
01:14:00,268 --> 01:14:02,560
Don't you believe in spooks?

993
01:14:02,728 --> 01:14:04,979
No. Why, only... Oh!

994
01:14:13,780 --> 01:14:15,740
Are you all right?

995
01:14:15,907 --> 01:14:17,491
I do believe in spooks.

996
01:14:17,659 --> 01:14:19,785
I do, I do, I do, I do.

997
01:14:20,120 --> 01:14:24,624
I do believe in spooks.
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do!

998
01:14:26,168 --> 01:14:29,587
You'll believe in more than that
before I'm finished with you.

999
01:14:31,757 --> 01:14:34,675
Take your army and bring me
that girl and her dog.

1000
01:14:34,843 --> 01:14:38,137
Do what you like with the others,
but I want her alive and unharmed.

1001
01:14:38,305 --> 01:14:40,806
They'll give you no trouble.
I promise you that.

1002
01:14:40,974 --> 01:14:45,061
I've sent a little insect on ahead
to take the fight out of them.

1003
01:14:45,771 --> 01:14:49,649
Take special care of those slippers.
I want those most of all.

1004
01:14:49,816 --> 01:14:51,525
Now, fly! Fly!

1005
01:14:51,693 --> 01:14:54,236
Bring me that girl and her slippers!

1006
01:14:54,404 --> 01:14:57,281
Fly! Fly! Fly!

1007
01:15:25,935 --> 01:15:28,061
Help! Help!

1008
01:15:28,479 --> 01:15:30,146
Go away now!

1009
01:15:32,483 --> 01:15:35,527
Toto! Toto! Help!

1010
01:15:50,501 --> 01:15:53,461
Help! Help! Help!

1011
01:15:53,629 --> 01:15:54,963
What happened to you?

1012
01:15:55,131 --> 01:15:57,465
They tore my legs off
and threw them over there!

1013
01:15:57,633 --> 01:16:00,218
Then they took my chest
and threw it over there!

1014
01:16:00,386 --> 01:16:01,720
That's you all over.

1015
01:16:01,887 --> 01:16:03,888
They sure knocked
the stuffings out of you.

1016
01:16:04,056 --> 01:16:07,600
Don't stand there. Put me together.
We've got to find Dorothy!

1017
01:16:07,768 --> 01:16:09,269
Now, let's see...

1018
01:16:12,273 --> 01:16:15,316
What a nice little dog.

1019
01:16:18,821 --> 01:16:22,490
And you, my dear.
What an unexpected pleasure.

1020
01:16:22,658 --> 01:16:27,035
It's so kind of you to visit me
in my loneliness.

1021
01:16:28,455 --> 01:16:31,248
What are you gonna do with my dog?
Give him back to me!

1022
01:16:31,416 --> 01:16:33,876
All in good time, my little pretty.

1023
01:16:34,043 --> 01:16:38,005
- All in good time.
- Please give me back my dog.

1024
01:16:38,173 --> 01:16:40,507
Certainly, certainly...

1025
01:16:40,675 --> 01:16:43,635
...when you give me those slippers.

1026
01:16:43,803 --> 01:16:47,639
- But the Good Witch told me not to.
- Very well.

1027
01:16:47,807 --> 01:16:49,975
Throw that basket in the river
and drown him.

1028
01:16:50,143 --> 01:16:54,271
No! Here. You can have your old
slippers, but give me back Toto!

1029
01:16:54,439 --> 01:16:56,106
That's a good little girl.

1030
01:16:56,274 --> 01:16:58,901
I knew you'd see reason!

1031
01:17:02,197 --> 01:17:05,616
I'm sorry! I didn't do it.
Can I still have my dog?

1032
01:17:05,784 --> 01:17:10,120
No! Fool that I am,
I should have remembered...

1033
01:17:10,288 --> 01:17:12,539
...those slippers will
never come off...

1034
01:17:12,707 --> 01:17:16,627
...as long as you're alive.

1035
01:17:16,795 --> 01:17:20,631
But that's not what's worrying me.
It's how to do it.

1036
01:17:20,799 --> 01:17:23,342
These things
must be done delicately...

1037
01:17:23,927 --> 01:17:25,719
...or you hurt the spell.

1038
01:17:26,387 --> 01:17:29,598
Run, Toto, run!
Catch him, you fool!

1039
01:17:39,274 --> 01:17:41,275
Run, Toto, run!

1040
01:17:41,860 --> 01:17:44,111
Run, Toto, run!

1041
01:17:44,988 --> 01:17:47,657
He got away! He got away!

1042
01:17:48,325 --> 01:17:50,368
Which is more than you will!

1043
01:17:50,536 --> 01:17:52,078
Drat, you and your dog!

1044
01:17:52,246 --> 01:17:54,914
You've been more trouble to me
than you're worth.

1045
01:17:55,082 --> 01:17:58,167
But it'll soon be over now!

1046
01:17:59,628 --> 01:18:00,962
Do you see that?

1047
01:18:01,129 --> 01:18:03,673
That's how much longer
you've got to be alive.

1048
01:18:03,841 --> 01:18:07,051
And it isn't long, my pretty.
It isn't long!

1049
01:18:07,219 --> 01:18:10,012
I can't wait forever
to get those shoes!

1050
01:18:31,785 --> 01:18:33,870
I'm frightened.

1051
01:18:34,037 --> 01:18:37,832
I'm frightened, Auntie Em!
I'm frightened.

1052
01:18:40,127 --> 01:18:43,129
Dorothy! Dorothy!

1053
01:18:43,297 --> 01:18:46,883
Where are you?
It's me. It's Auntie Em.

1054
01:18:47,050 --> 01:18:50,219
We're trying to find you.
Where are you?

1055
01:18:50,387 --> 01:18:52,429
I'm here in Oz, Auntie Em.

1056
01:18:52,597 --> 01:18:54,931
I'm locked up in the Witch's castle...

1057
01:18:55,099 --> 01:18:58,101
...and I'm trying to get home to you,
Auntie Em!

1058
01:18:58,644 --> 01:19:00,854
Oh, Auntie Em, don't go away!

1059
01:19:01,022 --> 01:19:04,399
I'm frightened!
Come back! Come back!

1060
01:19:04,650 --> 01:19:07,652
"Auntie Em, Auntie Em! Come back!"

1061
01:19:07,820 --> 01:19:10,363
I'll give you Auntie Em, my pretty!

1062
01:19:36,891 --> 01:19:41,269
Look! There's Toto.
Where'd he come from?

1063
01:19:42,396 --> 01:19:46,900
Why, don't you see?
He's come to take us to Dorothy.

1064
01:19:47,568 --> 01:19:49,486
Come on, fellas!

1065
01:20:07,879 --> 01:20:09,922
I hope my strength holds out.

1066
01:20:10,090 --> 01:20:12,800
I hope your tail holds out.

1067
01:20:25,063 --> 01:20:26,397
What's that? What's that?

1068
01:20:27,232 --> 01:20:29,358
That's the castle of the Wicked Witch.

1069
01:20:29,526 --> 01:20:33,195
- Dorothy's in that awful place?
- I hate to think of her in there.

1070
01:20:33,363 --> 01:20:36,115
- We've got to get her out.
- Don't cry now.

1071
01:20:36,282 --> 01:20:39,702
We haven't got the oilcan, and you've
been squeaking enough as it is.

1072
01:20:40,120 --> 01:20:41,829
Who's them? Who's them?

1073
01:20:56,136 --> 01:20:59,888
- I've got a plan how to get in there.
- Fine. He's got a plan.

1074
01:21:00,056 --> 01:21:02,891
- And you're gonna lead us.
- Yeah.

1075
01:21:03,059 --> 01:21:05,477
- Me?
- Yes, you.

1076
01:21:05,937 --> 01:21:09,356
- I gotta get her out of there?
- That's right.

1077
01:21:10,150 --> 01:21:12,776
All right, I'll go in there
for Dorothy.

1078
01:21:12,944 --> 01:21:14,945
Wicked Witch or no Wicked Witch...

1079
01:21:15,113 --> 01:21:18,740
...guards or no guards,
I'll tear them apart.

1080
01:21:19,366 --> 01:21:22,994
I may not come out alive,
but I'm going in there.

1081
01:21:23,162 --> 01:21:27,040
- There's only one thing I want you to do.
- What's that?

1082
01:21:27,207 --> 01:21:29,500
Talk me out of it.

1083
01:21:31,253 --> 01:21:32,587
- No, you don't!
- Oh, no.

1084
01:21:32,755 --> 01:21:34,547
- Now, wait a minute.
Up!

1085
01:21:51,607 --> 01:21:53,149
Shh!

1086
01:22:06,288 --> 01:22:07,747
Shh! Shh!

1087
01:22:34,315 --> 01:22:36,650
Come on, I've got another idea.

1088
01:22:36,818 --> 01:22:40,403
Do you think it would be polite,
dropping in like this?

1089
01:23:14,147 --> 01:23:16,606
- Where do we go now?
- Yeah.

1090
01:23:19,026 --> 01:23:20,235
There!

1091
01:23:29,871 --> 01:23:32,956
Wait! We better make sure.
Dorothy, are you in there?

1092
01:23:33,124 --> 01:23:35,041
It's us!
- Yes!

1093
01:23:35,209 --> 01:23:38,170
It's me! She's locked me in!

1094
01:23:38,337 --> 01:23:40,755
We gotta get her out! Open the door!

1095
01:23:40,923 --> 01:23:42,965
Oh, hurry! Please hurry!

1096
01:23:43,133 --> 01:23:44,925
The hourglass is almost empty!

1097
01:23:45,093 --> 01:23:46,719
Stand back!

1098
01:24:02,569 --> 01:24:05,196
Oh, Toto! Toto! Oh, Lion!

1099
01:24:05,363 --> 01:24:07,406
I knew you'd come!
I knew you would!

1100
01:24:07,574 --> 01:24:10,409
Hurry, we've got no time to lose!

1101
01:24:21,796 --> 01:24:25,549
Going so soon?
I wouldn't hear of it.

1102
01:24:25,717 --> 01:24:29,762
Why, my little party's just beginning.

1103
01:24:29,930 --> 01:24:32,640
Trapped. Trapped like mice... rats.

1104
01:24:41,316 --> 01:24:43,859
That's right.
Don't hurt them right away.

1105
01:24:44,027 --> 01:24:46,654
We'll let them think about it
a little first.

1106
01:24:56,622 --> 01:24:58,873
Seize them! Seize them!

1107
01:24:59,041 --> 01:25:00,875
Stop them, you fools!

1108
01:25:01,043 --> 01:25:04,420
Seize them! Seize them!

1109
01:25:13,347 --> 01:25:15,056
There they go! Now we've got them!

1110
01:25:15,224 --> 01:25:17,600
Half of you go this way,
half of you go that way.

1111
01:25:17,810 --> 01:25:18,935
Hurry! Hurry!

1112
01:25:26,735 --> 01:25:28,736
Where do we go now?

1113
01:25:28,904 --> 01:25:31,698
This way. Come on!

1114
01:25:38,414 --> 01:25:39,622
Back! Back!

1115
01:25:58,100 --> 01:25:59,809
Well!

1116
01:25:59,977 --> 01:26:02,770
Ring-around the rosie,
a pocket full of spears!

1117
01:26:02,938 --> 01:26:05,648
Thought you'd be pretty foxy,
didn't you?

1118
01:26:05,816 --> 01:26:09,943
The last to go will see
the first three go before her.

1119
01:26:11,487 --> 01:26:13,155
And her mangy little dog too!

1120
01:26:21,456 --> 01:26:23,832
How about a little fire, Scarecrow?

1121
01:26:26,002 --> 01:26:29,421
Help! I'm burning! I'm burning!
It's burning! Help!

1122
01:26:29,589 --> 01:26:31,048
Don't throw that water!

1123
01:26:33,509 --> 01:26:35,802
You cursed brat!
Look what you've done!

1124
01:26:35,970 --> 01:26:38,472
I'm melting! Melting!

1125
01:26:38,639 --> 01:26:41,016
Oh, what a world! What a world!

1126
01:26:41,225 --> 01:26:43,643
Who would've thought
a good little girl like you...

1127
01:26:43,811 --> 01:26:46,897
...could destroy
my beautiful wickedness?

1128
01:26:47,065 --> 01:26:49,691
Look out! Look out!

1129
01:26:49,859 --> 01:26:51,902
I'm going.

1130
01:27:07,210 --> 01:27:09,961
She's dead. You've killed her.

1131
01:27:10,129 --> 01:27:13,382
I didn't mean to kill her.
Really, I didn't.

1132
01:27:13,549 --> 01:27:16,301
It's just that he was on fire.

1133
01:27:16,469 --> 01:27:18,844
Hail to Dorothy!
The Wicked Witch is dead!

1134
01:27:19,012 --> 01:27:22,848
Hail! Hail to Dorothy!
The Wicked Witch is dead!

1135
01:27:23,016 --> 01:27:24,308
The broom.

1136
01:27:24,518 --> 01:27:26,977
- May we have it?
- Please. And take it with you.

1137
01:27:27,145 --> 01:27:29,605
Oh, thank you so much!

1138
01:27:29,773 --> 01:27:32,608
Now we can go tell the Wizard
the Wicked Witch is dead!

1139
01:27:32,776 --> 01:27:34,235
The Wicked Witch is dead!

1140
01:27:34,403 --> 01:27:36,987
Can I believe my eyes?

1141
01:27:37,155 --> 01:27:40,241
Why have you come back?

1142
01:27:41,326 --> 01:27:44,245
Please, sir. We've done
what you told us.

1143
01:27:44,413 --> 01:27:47,665
We've brought you the broomstick
of the Wicked Witch of the West.

1144
01:27:47,833 --> 01:27:49,875
We melted her.

1145
01:27:50,043 --> 01:27:53,796
Ah, you liquidated her, eh?

1146
01:27:53,964 --> 01:27:55,965
- Very resourceful.
- Yes, sir.

1147
01:27:56,133 --> 01:27:59,552
So we'd like you to keep your promise
to us, if you please, sir.

1148
01:27:59,719 --> 01:28:03,055
Not so fast. Not so fast!

1149
01:28:03,223 --> 01:28:05,808
I'll have to give the matter
a little thought.

1150
01:28:05,976 --> 01:28:09,019
Go away and come back tomorrow.

1151
01:28:09,187 --> 01:28:13,399
Tomorrow?
Oh, but I wanna go home now!

1152
01:28:13,567 --> 01:28:16,527
- You've had plenty of time already.
- Yeah.

1153
01:28:16,695 --> 01:28:20,573
Do not arouse the wrath
of the great and powerful Oz!

1154
01:28:20,782 --> 01:28:23,868
I said come back tomorrow!

1155
01:28:24,202 --> 01:28:27,121
If you were really great and powerful,
you'd keep your promises.

1156
01:28:27,289 --> 01:28:30,958
Do you presume to criticize
the great Oz?

1157
01:28:31,125 --> 01:28:33,626
You ungrateful creatures!

1158
01:28:33,794 --> 01:28:37,547
Think yourselves lucky that I'm
giving you audience tomorrow...

1159
01:28:37,715 --> 01:28:40,550
...instead of 20 years from now!

1160
01:28:40,718 --> 01:28:42,010
Oh!

1161
01:28:42,178 --> 01:28:46,598
The great Oz has spoken! Oh!

1162
01:28:46,765 --> 01:28:50,560
Pay no attention to that man
behind the curtain.

1163
01:28:50,728 --> 01:28:54,105
The great and...
Oz has spoken.

1164
01:28:54,273 --> 01:28:56,232
Who are you?

1165
01:28:56,400 --> 01:29:00,403
I am the great and powerful
Wizard of Oz.

1166
01:29:00,571 --> 01:29:03,823
You are? I don't believe you.

1167
01:29:03,991 --> 01:29:07,452
I'm afraid it's true.
There's no other Wizard except me.

1168
01:29:07,620 --> 01:29:09,954
- You humbug!
- Yeah.

1169
01:29:10,372 --> 01:29:13,625
Yes, that's exactly so. I'm a humbug.

1170
01:29:14,543 --> 01:29:16,753
You're a very bad man!

1171
01:29:16,962 --> 01:29:19,923
Oh, no, my dear. I'm a very good man.

1172
01:29:20,090 --> 01:29:23,635
I'm just a very bad wizard.

1173
01:29:23,969 --> 01:29:25,845
What about the heart
you promised Tin Man?

1174
01:29:26,013 --> 01:29:28,014
And the courage you promised
Cowardly Lion?

1175
01:29:28,182 --> 01:29:30,099
- And Scarecrow's brain?
- And Scarecrow's brain?

1176
01:29:30,267 --> 01:29:34,187
Why, anybody can have a brain.
That's a very mediocre commodity.

1177
01:29:34,355 --> 01:29:37,232
Every pusillanimous creature
that crawls on the earth...

1178
01:29:37,483 --> 01:29:40,860
...or slinks through slimy seas
has a brain.

1179
01:29:41,028 --> 01:29:43,238
Back where I come from,
we have universities...

1180
01:29:43,405 --> 01:29:46,782
...seats of great learning,
where men go to become great thinkers.

1181
01:29:46,991 --> 01:29:51,078
They think deep thoughts,
and with no more brains than you have.

1182
01:29:51,246 --> 01:29:55,249
But they have one thing
you haven't got. A diploma.

1183
01:29:55,416 --> 01:29:59,461
Therefore, by virtue
of the authority vested in me...

1184
01:29:59,629 --> 01:30:03,465
...by the Universitatus Committeeatum
E Pluribus Unum...

1185
01:30:03,633 --> 01:30:05,801
...I hereby confer upon you...

1186
01:30:05,969 --> 01:30:10,931
...the honorary degree of Th. D.
- Th. D.?

1187
01:30:11,140 --> 01:30:13,475
That's Doctor of Thinkology.

1188
01:30:13,726 --> 01:30:16,436
The sum of the square roots of
two sides of an isosceles triangle...

1189
01:30:16,688 --> 01:30:19,565
...is equal to the square root
of the remaining side.

1190
01:30:20,817 --> 01:30:22,776
Oh, joy! Rapture!

1191
01:30:22,944 --> 01:30:24,695
I've got a brain!

1192
01:30:24,862 --> 01:30:27,155
- How can I thank you enough?
- Well, you can't.

1193
01:30:27,323 --> 01:30:31,243
As for you, my fine friend, you're
a victim of disorganized thinking.

1194
01:30:31,411 --> 01:30:35,163
You are under the delusion that
because you run away from danger...

1195
01:30:35,331 --> 01:30:39,251
...you have no courage.
You're confusing courage with wisdom.

1196
01:30:39,419 --> 01:30:43,380
Back where I come from,
we have men who are called "heroes. "

1197
01:30:43,548 --> 01:30:46,717
Once a year, they take
their fortitude out of mothballs...

1198
01:30:46,884 --> 01:30:49,136
...and parade it down the main street.

1199
01:30:49,304 --> 01:30:51,513
And they have no more courage
than you have.

1200
01:30:51,681 --> 01:30:56,767
But they have one thing
that you haven't got. A medal.

1201
01:30:56,935 --> 01:30:58,269
Therefore...

1202
01:30:58,437 --> 01:31:02,023
...for meritorious conduct,
extraordinary valor...

1203
01:31:02,190 --> 01:31:05,318
...conspicuous bravery
against wicked witches...

1204
01:31:05,485 --> 01:31:08,738
...I award you the Triple Cross.

1205
01:31:08,905 --> 01:31:11,532
You are now a member
of the Legion of Courage.

1206
01:31:16,079 --> 01:31:17,955
Shucks, folks, I'm speechless.

1207
01:31:19,124 --> 01:31:23,127
As for you, my galvanized friend,
you want a heart.

1208
01:31:23,295 --> 01:31:25,921
You don't know how lucky you are
not to have one.

1209
01:31:26,089 --> 01:31:30,343
Hearts will never be practical
until they can be made unbreakable.

1210
01:31:31,053 --> 01:31:33,262
But I still want one.

1211
01:31:33,555 --> 01:31:37,600
Back where I come from, there are men
who do nothing all day but good deeds.

1212
01:31:37,768 --> 01:31:40,269
They are called phil...

1213
01:31:41,521 --> 01:31:44,815
Good-deed-doers. And their hearts
are no bigger than yours.

1214
01:31:44,983 --> 01:31:49,195
But they have one thing
you haven't got. A testimonial.

1215
01:31:49,363 --> 01:31:52,156
Therefore, in consideration
of your kindness...

1216
01:31:52,324 --> 01:31:55,159
...I take pleasure at this time
in presenting you...

1217
01:31:55,327 --> 01:31:58,954
...with a small token
of our esteem and affection.

1218
01:31:59,122 --> 01:32:02,041
And remember,
my sentimental friend...

1219
01:32:02,209 --> 01:32:05,336
...that a heart is not judged
by how much you love...

1220
01:32:05,504 --> 01:32:08,506
...but by how much you are loved
by others.

1221
01:32:08,714 --> 01:32:10,006
Ah.

1222
01:32:11,425 --> 01:32:13,760
Oh! It ticks!

1223
01:32:13,928 --> 01:32:16,304
Listen! Look, it ticks!

1224
01:32:16,972 --> 01:32:19,557
Read what my medal says. "Courage. "

1225
01:32:19,725 --> 01:32:22,060
Ain't it the truth!
Ain't it the truth!

1226
01:32:22,228 --> 01:32:23,853
Oh, they're all wonderful.

1227
01:32:24,021 --> 01:32:26,398
Hey, what about Dorothy?

1228
01:32:26,565 --> 01:32:30,610
Yes, how about Dorothy?
- Yeah. Dorothy next.

1229
01:32:30,778 --> 01:32:34,322
I don't think there's anything
in that black bag for me.

1230
01:32:34,490 --> 01:32:36,533
You force me into
a cataclysmic decision.

1231
01:32:36,701 --> 01:32:40,745
The only way to get Dorothy to Kansas
is for me to take her myself.

1232
01:32:42,248 --> 01:32:45,583
Oh, will you? Could you? Oh!

1233
01:32:46,168 --> 01:32:48,378
But are you clever enough
to manage it?

1234
01:32:48,546 --> 01:32:52,632
Child, you cut me to the quick!
I'm an old Kansas man myself...

1235
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:55,552
...born and bred
in the western wilderness...

1236
01:32:55,720 --> 01:32:59,848
...premier balloonist par excellence to the
Miracle Wonderland Carnival Company.

1237
01:33:00,015 --> 01:33:04,811
Until one day, while performing
feats of stratospheric skill...

1238
01:33:04,979 --> 01:33:07,355
...never before attempted
by civilized man...

1239
01:33:07,523 --> 01:33:12,110
...an unfortunate phenomena occurred.
The balloon failed to return to the fair.

1240
01:33:12,278 --> 01:33:14,404
- It did?
- Weren't you frightened?

1241
01:33:14,572 --> 01:33:18,074
You are talking to a man who has
laughed in the face of death...

1242
01:33:18,242 --> 01:33:22,911
...sneered at doom and chuckled
at catastrophe. I was petrified.

1243
01:33:23,079 --> 01:33:24,747
Suddenly the wind changed...

1244
01:33:24,914 --> 01:33:28,250
...and the balloon floated down
into this noble city...

1245
01:33:28,418 --> 01:33:33,630
...where I was instantly acclaimed Oz,
the first wizard deluxe!

1246
01:33:33,798 --> 01:33:36,633
Times being what they were,
I accepted the job...

1247
01:33:36,801 --> 01:33:41,096
...retaining my balloon
against the advent of a quick getaway.

1248
01:33:41,264 --> 01:33:43,390
And in that balloon, dear Dorothy...

1249
01:33:43,558 --> 01:33:48,562
...you and I will return to
the land of E Pluribus Unum.

1250
01:33:53,943 --> 01:33:57,613
My friends. I mean, my friends!

1251
01:34:02,577 --> 01:34:07,039
This is positively the finest
exhibition ever to be shown...

1252
01:34:07,207 --> 01:34:09,166
...be that as it may.

1253
01:34:09,334 --> 01:34:13,003
I, your Wizard per ardua ad alta...

1254
01:34:13,171 --> 01:34:15,506
...am about to embark
upon a hazardous...

1255
01:34:15,673 --> 01:34:18,550
...and technically
unexplainable journey...

1256
01:34:18,718 --> 01:34:22,012
...into the outer stratosphere!

1257
01:34:25,391 --> 01:34:26,725
To confer, converse...

1258
01:34:26,893 --> 01:34:30,479
...and otherwise hobnob
with my brother wizards.

1259
01:34:30,647 --> 01:34:34,232
And I hereby decree
that until what time...

1260
01:34:34,399 --> 01:34:36,734
...if any, that I return...

1261
01:34:36,902 --> 01:34:41,656
...the Scarecrow, by virtue
of his highly superior brains...

1262
01:34:41,824 --> 01:34:43,699
...shall rule in my stead...

1263
01:34:43,867 --> 01:34:48,454
...assisted by the Tin Man,
by virtue of his magnificent heart...

1264
01:34:48,622 --> 01:34:52,458
...and the Lion,
by virtue of his courage.

1265
01:34:52,626 --> 01:34:55,253
Obey them as you would me.
Thank you.

1266
01:34:59,091 --> 01:35:02,093
Oh, Toto! Come back! Toto!

1267
01:35:02,261 --> 01:35:04,679
Don't go without me.
I'll be right back.

1268
01:35:04,847 --> 01:35:05,888
Stop that dog!

1269
01:35:06,056 --> 01:35:10,810
This is a highly irregular procedure.
This is absolutely unprecedented!

1270
01:35:10,978 --> 01:35:14,063
- Ruined my exit!
Come back! Come back!

1271
01:35:14,231 --> 01:35:16,774
Don't go without me!
Please come back!

1272
01:35:16,942 --> 01:35:20,278
I can't come back!
I don't know how it works!

1273
01:35:20,445 --> 01:35:21,946
Goodbye, folks!

1274
01:35:22,114 --> 01:35:24,240
Goodbye!

1275
01:35:27,911 --> 01:35:30,538
Oh, now I'll never get home.

1276
01:35:30,998 --> 01:35:33,332
Stay with us then, Dorothy.

1277
01:35:33,500 --> 01:35:35,209
We all love you.

1278
01:35:35,377 --> 01:35:37,879
We don't want you to go.

1279
01:35:38,046 --> 01:35:40,381
That's very kind of you...

1280
01:35:40,549 --> 01:35:43,634
...but this could never be like Kansas.

1281
01:35:43,802 --> 01:35:48,013
Auntie Em must have stopped wondering
what happened to me by now.

1282
01:35:48,180 --> 01:35:51,224
Oh, Scarecrow,
what am I going to do?

1283
01:35:52,852 --> 01:35:54,227
Look!

1284
01:35:54,645 --> 01:35:56,521
Here's someone who can help you!

1285
01:36:30,222 --> 01:36:34,309
- Will you help me? Can you help me?
- You don't need help any longer.

1286
01:36:34,477 --> 01:36:37,312
You've always had the power
to go back to Kansas.

1287
01:36:37,480 --> 01:36:40,398
- I have?
- Then why didn't you tell her before?

1288
01:36:40,566 --> 01:36:44,569
Because she wouldn't have believed me.
She had to learn it for herself.

1289
01:36:44,737 --> 01:36:47,155
What have you learned, Dorothy?

1290
01:36:47,365 --> 01:36:48,990
Well...

1291
01:36:50,493 --> 01:36:52,243
I think that it...

1292
01:36:52,411 --> 01:36:56,414
...that it wasn't enough just to want
to see Uncle Henry and Auntie Em.

1293
01:36:56,582 --> 01:37:01,251
And it's that if I ever go looking
for my heart's desire again...

1294
01:37:01,419 --> 01:37:04,838
...I won't look any further
than my own back yard...

1295
01:37:05,006 --> 01:37:07,341
...because if it isn't there...

1296
01:37:07,509 --> 01:37:10,594
...I never really lost it to begin with.

1297
01:37:10,762 --> 01:37:11,887
Is that right?

1298
01:37:12,347 --> 01:37:13,847
That's all it is.

1299
01:37:14,015 --> 01:37:17,184
But that's so easy!
I should've thought of it for you.

1300
01:37:17,352 --> 01:37:21,105
- I should've felt it in my heart.
- She had to find it out for herself.

1301
01:37:21,272 --> 01:37:24,775
Now those magic slippers will
take you home in two seconds.

1302
01:37:24,943 --> 01:37:27,486
- Toto too?
- Toto too.

1303
01:37:27,696 --> 01:37:29,738
- Now?
- Whenever you wish.

1304
01:37:29,906 --> 01:37:33,409
Oh, dear.
That's too wonderful to be true!

1305
01:37:35,161 --> 01:37:36,245
Oh, it's...

1306
01:37:36,413 --> 01:37:39,873
It's gonna be so hard
to say goodbye.

1307
01:37:40,041 --> 01:37:42,418
I love you all too.

1308
01:37:44,587 --> 01:37:46,755
Goodbye, Tin Man.

1309
01:37:46,923 --> 01:37:49,174
Oh, don't cry.

1310
01:37:49,384 --> 01:37:52,386
You'll rust so dreadfully.

1311
01:37:53,096 --> 01:37:56,223
Here. Here's your oilcan.

1312
01:37:57,726 --> 01:38:00,602
- Goodbye.
- Now I know I've got a heart...

1313
01:38:00,770 --> 01:38:02,855
...because it's breaking.

1314
01:38:06,067 --> 01:38:09,528
Goodbye, Lion.
I know it isn't right...

1315
01:38:09,696 --> 01:38:13,448
...but I'm gonna miss the way
you used to holler for help...

1316
01:38:13,615 --> 01:38:16,117
...before you found your courage.

1317
01:38:16,285 --> 01:38:20,371
I would never have found it
if it hadn't been for you.

1318
01:38:25,085 --> 01:38:28,171
I think I'll miss you most of all.

1319
01:38:33,093 --> 01:38:36,220
- Are you ready now?
- Yes.

1320
01:38:37,848 --> 01:38:40,099
Say goodbye, Toto.

1321
01:38:42,644 --> 01:38:46,355
- Yes, I'm ready now.
- Then close your eyes...

1322
01:38:46,523 --> 01:38:49,525
...and tap your heels
together three times...

1323
01:38:51,695 --> 01:38:53,738
...and think to yourself:

1324
01:38:53,906 --> 01:38:56,908
"There's no place like home.

1325
01:38:57,076 --> 01:39:00,411
There's no place like home. "

1326
01:39:00,579 --> 01:39:26,061
There's no place like home.

1327
01:39:28,189 --> 01:39:30,899
Wake up, honey.
- There's no place like home.

1328
01:39:31,984 --> 01:39:34,486
There's no place like home.

1329
01:39:36,447 --> 01:39:38,240
There's no...

1330
01:39:41,035 --> 01:39:44,538
Dorothy, dear. It's Aunt Em, darling.

1331
01:39:44,705 --> 01:39:46,790
Oh, Auntie Em, it's you!

1332
01:39:46,958 --> 01:39:49,960
- Yes, darling.
Hello there! Anybody home?

1333
01:39:50,128 --> 01:39:53,797
I dropped by because I heard
the little girl got caught in the big...

1334
01:39:53,965 --> 01:39:57,759
- Well, she seems all right now.
- She got quite a bump on the head.

1335
01:39:57,927 --> 01:40:00,470
We kind of thought
she was gonna leave us.

1336
01:40:00,638 --> 01:40:03,348
But I did leave you.
That's just the trouble.

1337
01:40:03,516 --> 01:40:05,517
And I tried to get back for days!

1338
01:40:05,685 --> 01:40:07,644
There, there, lie quiet now.

1339
01:40:07,812 --> 01:40:10,897
- You just had a bad dream.
- Sure.

1340
01:40:11,065 --> 01:40:12,649
Remember me...

1341
01:40:12,817 --> 01:40:15,068
...your old pal, Hunk?

1342
01:40:15,236 --> 01:40:17,863
And me, Hickory?

1343
01:40:18,030 --> 01:40:19,865
You couldn't forget my face,
could you?

1344
01:40:20,032 --> 01:40:23,785
No. But it wasn't a dream.
It was a place.

1345
01:40:23,953 --> 01:40:26,621
And you and you and you...

1346
01:40:26,789 --> 01:40:28,707
...and you were there.

1347
01:40:29,959 --> 01:40:31,835
But you couldn't have been,
could you?

1348
01:40:32,003 --> 01:40:34,004
We dream lots
of silly things when we...

1349
01:40:34,172 --> 01:40:38,174
No, Aunt Em, this was
a real, truly live place.

1350
01:40:38,341 --> 01:40:41,427
And I remember that some of it
wasn't very nice...

1351
01:40:41,595 --> 01:40:43,554
...but most of it was beautiful.

1352
01:40:43,722 --> 01:40:47,600
But just the same, all I kept saying
to everybody was, "I want to go home!"

1353
01:40:47,767 --> 01:40:49,852
And they sent me home.

1354
01:40:51,688 --> 01:40:53,522
Doesn't anybody believe me?

1355
01:40:53,690 --> 01:40:55,774
Of course we believe you, Dorothy.

1356
01:40:55,942 --> 01:40:58,444
But anyway, Toto, we're home!

1357
01:40:58,612 --> 01:41:01,447
Home! And this is my room...

1358
01:41:01,615 --> 01:41:03,199
...and you're all here.

1359
01:41:03,366 --> 01:41:06,577
And I'm not going to leave here
ever, ever again...

1360
01:41:06,745 --> 01:41:08,704
...because I love you all.

1361
01:41:08,872 --> 01:41:12,333
And oh, Auntie Em...

1362
01:41:12,500 --> 01:41:15,544
...there's no place like home!
