1
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:09,839
Have it, this is yours, this
is yours and that's yours.

2
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:13,636
Draw, paint and do
whatever you want to do.

3
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:16,706
Till now I be back by dropping this.

4
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:21,051
But what we paint sir there
is nothing on the table.

5
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:24,622
This table.

6
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:32,021
This table is very too small sweetheart
that it can't bare your beautiful thoughts.

7
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:36,961
Look in to your mind and draw
an amazing Technicolor photo.

8
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:39,128
and drop it on the paper.

9
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:44,086
Steal, steal the joy.
Nobody is here to stop you.

10
00:06:30,923 --> 00:06:33,643
Where were you been lost friend?

11
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:37,912
Are you looking for
something in thoughts?

12
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:40,731
Nothing to worry and rush.

13
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:53,771
What happen kid?

14
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,515
Don't you like painting?

15
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:06,016
What is your name son?

16
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:11,656
Sir his name is Ishaan Awasthi.

17
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:16,727
Thanks.

18
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:40,859
Where did you go? Where did you go?

19
00:08:41,787 --> 00:08:43,679
Your mother called.

20
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:46,482
Go and stand by the phone,
she's going to call again.

21
00:08:46,492 --> 00:08:48,492
Go.

22
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:07,203
- Hello.
- Hello.

23
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:10,206
- Is Ishaan Awasthi around?
- Yes, Yes... Just a minute.

24
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,216
- Yes.
- Talk with him.

25
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:14,285
- Yes.
- Have it.

26
00:09:20,826 --> 00:09:25,286
Hello Enoo... Hello
Enoo... Say hello son.

27
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,937
Look Enoo, we can't come
on Saturday, son. Dada's

28
00:09:34,206 --> 00:09:39,306
...interschool tennis finals is
held on Sunday. Isn't it son?

29
00:09:39,645 --> 00:09:42,004
I know you are very angry with Mama.

30
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:43,205
Mama is very bad.

31
00:09:43,215 --> 00:09:45,215
Mama is very bad.

32
00:09:46,652 --> 00:09:51,385
I'm very sorry Enoo
but what can Mama do?

33
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:56,752
Dada is also having the
tension of finals. Isn't it?

34
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,554
Would you like to talk to Dada?

35
00:09:58,564 --> 00:10:03,292
Now talk to Dada. And wish him all
the best, one minute... one minute.

36
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:06,999
Hello Enoo. Hello Enoo are you there?

37
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:13,544
Enoo, I'll miss a lot in the finals.

38
00:10:15,214 --> 00:10:17,774
- Hello.
- Hello Enoo.

39
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:20,584
Enoo.

40
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:23,354
Son talk to Mama.

41
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:27,491
Hello... Enoo... Hello.

42
00:10:28,327 --> 00:10:31,490
- Hello.
- Hello Madam he left.

43
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:34,290
- Left.
- Yes Madam.

44
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,300
Sorry.

45
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:42,664
- What happen?
- He hadn't talked?

46
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:47,148
Don't worry we'll go next Sunday.

47
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:56,679
- Err! Why are you putting it there?
- This is the class work of the kids.

48
00:10:56,689 --> 00:11:01,851
Then what happened? Holkar didn't put
it there. That place is for the books.

49
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:04,253
Then where do I put them.
Return them to the kids.

50
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:06,983
By the way are they for any use?

51
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:09,925
What the wreckage they are
making in your class Nikumbh?

52
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:12,862
They are the kids,
the have to make noise.

53
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:16,933
And if the kids wouldn't
show there emotions in

54
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:19,969
...the art class then
where else they would show them.

55
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:26,694
That's alright. Just that Headmaster
wants discipline in the school. Discipline.

56
00:11:27,953 --> 00:11:30,846
I heard that you were
singing the class yesterday.

57
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:32,856
And playing the flute.

58
00:11:33,926 --> 00:11:37,119
Yes I was singing and playing the flute.

59
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:39,169
Kids happy so I'm happy.

60
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:43,693
But the children of this school isn't
like the children of that school.

61
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,703
What kind of children?

62
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:52,332
You are teaching in tulips school.

63
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:55,432
Mentally retorted abnormal kids.

64
00:11:55,848 --> 00:11:59,208
Teach the way you like in
that kind of school, it doesn't

65
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:01,444
...makes any difference. No future
wouldn't be made of that kids.

66
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:04,714
No serious teaching. This
is a formal school, your

67
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:07,750
...singing, dancing style
wouldn't be appreciated over here.

68
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:14,223
We prepare kids for the race of life.
They must compete, succeed. Make a future.

69
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:19,102
Three rules of our school.
Unity, faith and discipline.

70
00:12:19,638 --> 00:12:24,143
Three rules of success, the
way of complete education.

71
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,746
Hail Hitler.

72
00:12:30,816 --> 00:12:34,131
Tevari-ji now you have to learn German.

73
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,433
What happen Ishaan?

74
00:12:51,203 --> 00:12:52,962
Okay... Okay... Okay... Okay...

75
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:54,972
It's okay.

76
00:13:26,505 --> 00:13:29,395
Err! Listen, where is your friend?

77
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:34,436
Sir, don't know sir. He was
here by now, suddenly he ran off.

78
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:37,336
He saw his new boring art teacher.

79
00:13:37,616 --> 00:13:42,291
No... No sir, he went to the
dinning hall for the lunch.

80
00:13:42,788 --> 00:13:44,280
What is your name friend?

81
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,215
Rajan Dhamodhran sir.

82
00:13:46,225 --> 00:13:49,051
Rajan tell me one thing,
what is the matter of Ishaan?

83
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:51,951
- Sir.
- Is he having some problem?

84
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:54,523
He's afraid all the time.

85
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:56,913
- He wants to go home.
- Why?

86
00:13:57,336 --> 00:14:00,863
- He's a new boy sir.
- In the middle of the year.

87
00:14:00,873 --> 00:14:03,699
He's having a problem.
As much he can try but he

88
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:08,304
...can't read and write. He
has been punished all the time.

89
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:11,714
Red marks all over the book. What to do?

90
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:33,701
You play here, I'll be right back.
Ok?

91
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:09,207
Are you coming from somewhere
after cutting onions?

92
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,557
The human is...
- worse then animals.

93
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:16,692
I know that.

94
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:17,860
And blind too.

95
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:20,165
Away from the inner beauty.

96
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:24,597
Who you're confronting these days?

97
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,544
Myself.

98
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:30,105
After so long, I'm seeing
myself in the mirror.

99
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:32,574
So is there someone to
show you the mirror?

100
00:17:32,584 --> 00:17:34,576
That's what I always ask you to.

101
00:17:34,586 --> 00:17:36,586
You have a nice face.

102
00:17:36,855 --> 00:17:40,416
Jabeen, he's in danger.

103
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:44,494
Who?

104
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,066
Who?

105
00:17:49,768 --> 00:17:52,063
There's a boy in the school

106
00:17:52,704 --> 00:17:54,704
He's 8-9 years old.

107
00:17:56,842 --> 00:18:01,262
He doesn't do or speak anything,
always seems scared.

108
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:05,614
His eyes are like...
screaming for help.

109
00:18:09,955 --> 00:18:11,955
I'm afraid he'll fall.

110
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:22,658
Let's go, it's time for the lesson.

111
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:24,668
Ok, lets go.

112
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:29,665
Hey, Sail, come. Do you know
what's the time of the show?

113
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:30,766
After two days.

114
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:33,370
Yes.
Excellent, let's go.

115
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,865
Yes?
Hello.

116
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:39,000
My name's Ram Shankar Nikum.

117
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:41,220
I teach at New Era School.

118
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:44,981
Come in.

119
00:24:47,752 --> 00:24:51,067
Are these his 3rd standard books?
- Yes.

120
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,825
Who made this?

121
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:05,835
Ishaan did.

122
00:25:05,904 --> 00:25:08,029
Ishaan did?
Does he paint?

123
00:25:08,807 --> 00:25:10,807
Yes, he loves to paint.

124
00:26:52,644 --> 00:26:55,109
Can I have some water please?

125
00:27:19,704 --> 00:27:21,704
Why did you send him?

126
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:25,208
Why?

127
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:27,610
There was no choice.

128
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:29,704
Last year he failed in 3rd standard.

129
00:27:29,714 --> 00:27:31,840
Can you believe?
In 3rd standard.

130
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:33,508
And there's no sign of
improvement.

131
00:27:33,518 --> 00:27:35,944
This, my elder son, he comes 1st
in every class every subject.

132
00:27:35,954 --> 00:27:37,954
And that other one...

133
00:27:38,923 --> 00:27:40,615
What do you think, what
his problem is?

134
00:27:40,625 --> 00:27:43,184
Problem? His attitude. What else?

135
00:27:43,194 --> 00:27:47,389
Towards studies, towards everything.
Always stubborn, always attitude.

136
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:48,757
He never listens to anyone.

137
00:27:48,767 --> 00:27:51,593
I'm asking about his problem,
but you're telling me the symptoms.

138
00:27:51,603 --> 00:27:54,362
You're telling me he has the fever,
that's I know already.

139
00:27:54,372 --> 00:27:57,262
I'm asking why is he having fever.

140
00:27:57,308 --> 00:27:59,943
What's the reason of the fever?

141
00:28:00,745 --> 00:28:02,745
Then you tell me.

142
00:28:03,415 --> 00:28:05,415
Tell me.

143
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:12,614
Have you noticed any pattern
in his mistakes in his lessons?

144
00:28:12,624 --> 00:28:14,049
Pattern. What pattern?

145
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:15,884
They all are mistakes.

146
00:28:15,894 --> 00:28:19,039
Then you couldn't notice
the patterns.

147
00:28:25,003 --> 00:28:27,003
Look here.

148
00:28:27,672 --> 00:28:30,832
Here "b" is in place of "d"
and "d" in place of "b"

149
00:28:30,842 --> 00:28:34,035
Confusion among similar
looking alphabets.

150
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:37,405
Here, he wrote "s" and "r"
in reverse. Even more...

151
00:28:37,415 --> 00:28:38,606
Look here.

152
00:28:38,616 --> 00:28:40,709
This small "h" and small "t"

153
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,719
Mirror imaging.

154
00:28:43,455 --> 00:28:47,382
Animal, animal, animal. Three different
spellings on the same page.

155
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:50,852
It means, it's not the case that
he remembers one wrong spelling.

156
00:28:50,862 --> 00:28:53,421
He mixes similar looking words.

157
00:28:53,431 --> 00:28:55,811
This "t-o-p" becomes "p-o-t"

158
00:28:56,167 --> 00:28:59,227
This "s-o-I-i-d" become "s-o-i-I-d".

159
00:29:00,939 --> 00:29:02,939
Why does he do that?

160
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:05,241
Is he stupid, or lazy?

161
00:29:05,877 --> 00:29:07,569
No

162
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:11,999
I think, he's having difficulty
in recognizing words.

163
00:29:13,551 --> 00:29:18,246
When you read "a-p-p-I-e" apple,
you imagine a red apple in your head.

164
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:20,515
Maybe he can't read "apple"

165
00:29:20,525 --> 00:29:23,718
That's why he can't
get the meaning as well.

166
00:29:23,728 --> 00:29:29,428
To learn, one has to know the sounds,
visual and meanings of words.

167
00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:33,828
Ishaan is lacking this
very important need.

168
00:29:33,838 --> 00:29:35,864
There's nothing like that.
He only makes excuses.

169
00:29:35,874 --> 00:29:37,874
To skip the studies.

170
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:51,420
Read this please.

171
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,951
How can I read it?
It's in Chinese.

172
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:59,254
Try it.
Come on. Concentrate.

173
00:29:59,264 --> 00:30:00,388
What's this rubbish?

174
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:03,060
You're not behaving.

175
00:30:04,102 --> 00:30:06,102
You're being rascal.

176
00:30:14,412 --> 00:30:17,302
That's how Ishaan must be feeling.

177
00:30:17,715 --> 00:30:20,435
He couldn't understand
the words.

178
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:27,750
This problem in studies
is called as "Dyslexia".

179
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:41,462
Sometimes child has some more
problems other then Dyslexia.

180
00:30:41,472 --> 00:30:45,099
Like difficulty in understanding
multiple instructions.

181
00:30:45,109 --> 00:30:48,469
Turn to page 65, chapter 9,
Para 4, line 2

182
00:30:48,479 --> 00:30:50,004
Oonfusion...

183
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:53,177
Or Poor Final Gross Motus Skills.

184
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:58,112
Does Ishaan feel problems in
buttoning his shirt or tying his shoelace?

185
00:30:58,122 --> 00:30:59,047
Yes

186
00:30:59,057 --> 00:31:02,116
Can he catch the ball
when you throw it to him?

187
00:31:02,126 --> 00:31:04,485
He can never judge the ball.

188
00:31:04,495 --> 00:31:09,457
Because he can't understand the size,
distance and speed all together.

189
00:31:09,467 --> 00:31:12,260
A ball, how big, from how far and
at what speed coming towards him.

190
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:14,162
Until he analyze all this...

191
00:31:14,172 --> 00:31:16,172
It's too late.

192
00:31:21,112 --> 00:31:23,112
Think about it.

193
00:31:23,748 --> 00:31:26,308
A child
Just 8-9 years old.

194
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:28,925
Can't read, can't write.

195
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:31,479
Can't do day to day normal things.

196
00:31:31,489 --> 00:31:35,484
Can't do what other children
can do very easily.

197
00:31:36,361 --> 00:31:38,911
What could he go through then?

198
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:43,270
His self-confidence must have
been shattered.

199
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:48,663
He must have been fighting by hiding
his inabilities under stubbornness.

200
00:31:48,673 --> 00:31:52,073
He must have been making a
hell out here.

201
00:31:54,012 --> 00:31:56,037
Thinking, that why should he tell the
world that he can't do things.

202
00:31:56,047 --> 00:31:57,538
Why shouldn't he get all that ignored
by just saying that he doesn't want to do.

203
00:31:57,548 --> 00:32:01,203
That's what children learn from the elders.

204
00:32:05,857 --> 00:32:09,597
And now he can't even
continue to fight that.

205
00:32:10,728 --> 00:32:15,427
I'm sorry to say that
he has stopped painting.

206
00:32:23,541 --> 00:32:25,541
It's very sad.

207
00:32:28,346 --> 00:32:30,346
Why only Ishaan?

208
00:32:33,418 --> 00:32:35,209
There's no answer to that.

209
00:32:35,219 --> 00:32:37,745
It's a Neurological Disorder.
It can happen to anyone.

210
00:32:37,755 --> 00:32:39,547
Sometimes it can be genetic.

211
00:32:39,557 --> 00:32:44,352
To make it simple, there's just
some wiring problems in his brain.

212
00:32:44,362 --> 00:32:48,723
So you're saying that my son
isn't normal, he's mentally retarded.

213
00:32:48,733 --> 00:32:51,283
What kind of a person you are?

214
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,970
Look this, Mr. Awasti?

215
00:32:54,405 --> 00:32:57,065
This fast brain is playing with
thousands of thoughts with colors.

216
00:32:57,075 --> 00:32:59,067
Way more then yours and mine abilities.

217
00:32:59,077 --> 00:33:00,501
But what's the use of that?

218
00:33:00,511 --> 00:33:01,970
What are you looking into it?

219
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,071
Then what should I look?

220
00:33:03,081 --> 00:33:05,273
What will he become when
he'll grow up?

221
00:33:05,283 --> 00:33:08,173
How will he compete with
the world?

222
00:33:08,219 --> 00:33:12,299
Will I keep on feeding
him for whole of his life?

223
00:33:24,268 --> 00:33:26,268
I know this.

224
00:33:26,771 --> 00:33:29,406
There's a cold world out there.

225
00:33:29,974 --> 00:33:34,819
Everyone wants to grow toppers
and rankers in their homes.

226
00:33:37,482 --> 00:33:39,482
Everyone wants No. 1

227
00:33:39,817 --> 00:33:43,745
Doctor, engineer, management,
less then that is unacceptable.

228
00:33:43,755 --> 00:33:48,317
95.5%, 95.6%, 95.7%
less then that is uncountable.

229
00:33:49,093 --> 00:33:51,093
Isn't it?

230
00:33:51,462 --> 00:33:53,462
Think about this.

231
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:58,594
Every child has his own quality,
own expertise, own desire.

232
00:34:00,238 --> 00:34:02,234
But no,

233
00:34:02,244 --> 00:34:05,633
Everyone is busy stretching the
finger to make it long.

234
00:34:05,643 --> 00:34:10,318
Keep on doing that.
No matter you break the very finger.

235
00:34:13,584 --> 00:34:15,810
What's are the options?
- No options.

236
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:17,412
There's no way.

237
00:34:17,422 --> 00:34:20,281
If you like horse to race, then
breed race horses, damn it.

238
00:34:20,291 --> 00:34:23,181
Why do you give birth to children?

239
00:34:24,662 --> 00:34:28,056
Putting the weight of your ambitions
on your child, is worse then child labor.

240
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:30,106
And when the child can't

241
00:34:33,337 --> 00:34:36,227
what if he can't carry the weight?

242
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:40,835
When they will understand?

243
00:34:40,845 --> 00:34:43,571
That every child has his own
capacity to lift the weight.

244
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:45,406
He learns eventually.

245
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:49,666
Every child has own pace.
Five fingers make a fist.

246
00:34:54,959 --> 00:35:00,739
Why are we dreaming to settle
these little ones in to the mainstream?

247
00:37:04,021 --> 00:37:08,151
Friends, I'm going to tell
a story today.

248
00:37:13,097 --> 00:37:15,097
A story about a boy.

249
00:37:19,503 --> 00:37:22,263
There was a boy, don't ask where.

250
00:37:22,273 --> 00:37:25,733
He couldn't read and write.
Even after so many tries.

251
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:29,568
He couldn't remember that "y"
comes after "x".

252
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:33,774
Words were his enemies,
used to dance in front of his eyes.

253
00:37:33,784 --> 00:37:38,119
They used to tease him by
dancing and moving around.

254
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:41,115
Studies used to make him tired.

255
00:37:41,125 --> 00:37:43,384
Who he could have told his problem to?

256
00:37:43,394 --> 00:37:48,489
His mind was full, he was a starter bull,
and the alphabets were disco to him.

257
00:37:48,499 --> 00:37:50,191
He failed in the exams.

258
00:37:50,201 --> 00:37:52,627
He was a victim of the burden
of the studies.

259
00:37:52,637 --> 00:37:54,662
People called him an ass
and stupid.

260
00:37:54,672 --> 00:37:57,197
Boy took everything bravely.

261
00:37:58,009 --> 00:38:01,154
And one day, he did something genius.

262
00:38:01,178 --> 00:38:03,971
Everyone was shocked when
heard his theory.

263
00:38:03,981 --> 00:38:06,021
Tell me, who's that boy?

264
00:38:14,892 --> 00:38:16,517
Elbert Einstein.

265
00:38:16,527 --> 00:38:18,352
Correct Rajan,
Albert Einstein.

266
00:38:18,362 --> 00:38:20,221
Genius and great scientist.

267
00:38:20,231 --> 00:38:24,566
Who shocked the world with his
theory of relativity.

268
00:38:30,107 --> 00:38:32,147
Now tell me what's this?

269
00:38:37,715 --> 00:38:41,030
No, no.
It's not an ordinary helicopter.

270
00:38:41,952 --> 00:38:45,012
The great artist inventor,
Leonardo DaVinci

271
00:38:45,022 --> 00:38:48,014
Who?
- Leonardo DaVinci

272
00:38:48,459 --> 00:38:49,550
Yes,

273
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,556
he made this picture.

274
00:38:51,566 --> 00:38:53,321
A working sketch of a helicopter.

275
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:54,088
But when?

276
00:38:54,098 --> 00:38:55,523
In the 15th century.

277
00:38:55,533 --> 00:38:59,358
400 years before the first
airplane could fly.

278
00:39:00,471 --> 00:39:04,598
Do you know, Leonardo DaVinci used
to have difficulties to read and write.

279
00:39:04,608 --> 00:39:06,903
He used to write like this.

280
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:29,050
Can you make anything out of it?

281
00:39:36,674 --> 00:39:38,674
Now read it.

282
00:39:39,577 --> 00:39:44,139
My name is Ram Shankar Nikum.

283
00:39:52,089 --> 00:39:54,894
Ishaan, turn on the light please.

284
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:07,795
Who was the great person,
who lit the world with electricity?

285
00:40:07,805 --> 00:40:09,805
Edison.

286
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,732
Thomas Edison.

287
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:13,742
Correct Ishaan.

288
00:40:14,445 --> 00:40:16,995
He too was a victim of "abcd".

289
00:40:17,014 --> 00:40:18,773
Sit down Ishaan.

290
00:40:18,783 --> 00:40:20,574
No leave the light on.

291
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:23,134
Let Edison's light come on us.

292
00:40:32,463 --> 00:40:38,197
Everyone must know him.
- Abhishek Bachchan.

293
00:40:40,137 --> 00:40:43,230
He too used to have difficulties
in studies during childhood.

294
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,240
Now see, he is a blast.

295
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:55,276
There are more examples.
Pablo Picasso, famous painter.

296
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:58,091
He never understood
the number "7"

297
00:40:58,122 --> 00:41:03,052
He used to say, "It looks
like my uncle's nose in reverse."

298
00:41:03,594 --> 00:41:05,820
Who's the father of Mickey Mouse?
- Walt Disney.

299
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:07,755
Correct.
Walt Disney.

300
00:41:07,765 --> 00:41:11,692
He was too confused about words,
so he put his art into cartoons.

301
00:41:11,702 --> 00:41:13,727
Neil Diamond, popular singer.

302
00:41:13,737 --> 00:41:17,331
He used to write songs out of the
shame about his red report card.

303
00:41:17,341 --> 00:41:20,334
Agatha Christy, famous mystery book writer.

304
00:41:20,344 --> 00:41:24,872
Can you believe a writer, who was
unable to read in her childhood.

305
00:41:24,882 --> 00:41:29,114
But, why am I telling you all
this suddenly today?

306
00:41:31,689 --> 00:41:38,322
To show you that, there were gems
in the world who changed it.

307
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:42,389
They were able to see
the world from their eyes.

308
00:41:42,399 --> 00:41:44,258
Their minds were a bit different.

309
00:41:44,268 --> 00:41:46,930
People came in their ways.

310
00:41:48,205 --> 00:41:50,130
But still they won.

311
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:53,934
And they won like that the whole
world saw it in an awe.

312
00:41:53,944 --> 00:41:59,129
Out today's art class will be
dedicated to all those geniuses.

313
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:02,740
We will step out remembering them.

314
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:05,179
And we'll make something different.
Anything.

315
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:09,439
Pick anything you like,
rock, wood, junk, anything.

316
00:42:10,261 --> 00:42:12,896
Come on, move towards the door.

317
00:42:25,976 --> 00:42:27,976
Ishaan, one minute.

318
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:31,079
Rajan, you can go.

319
00:42:39,456 --> 00:42:44,726
Do you know there was another name
among all those I mentioned?

320
00:42:46,931 --> 00:42:50,094
Because that name is not that great.

321
00:42:52,937 --> 00:42:55,657
But he too had the same problem.

322
00:42:59,276 --> 00:43:02,734
That name is Ram Shankar Nikum.

323
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:14,746
I too had difficulties in
reading and writing.

324
00:43:15,192 --> 00:43:17,742
My father never understood me.

325
00:43:18,162 --> 00:43:23,177
He thought I was being naughty,
and wasn't paying attention.

326
00:43:23,534 --> 00:43:27,189
He thought I would not succeed
in my future.

327
00:43:27,838 --> 00:43:30,983
What a duffer and idiot could become?

328
00:43:34,044 --> 00:43:38,039
Whatever I am today,
I'm in front of you Ishaan.

329
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:46,955
Shall we go?

330
00:43:47,858 --> 00:43:49,858
Did you go to my home?

331
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:28,690
Hey, it's moving.

332
00:45:51,849 --> 00:45:53,849
Can it fly?

333
00:45:54,718 --> 00:45:56,410
Will it?

334
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:58,420
Who made it?

335
00:46:59,683 --> 00:47:00,808
Is Principal present?

336
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:03,028
Yes sir.
- Ok, stay seated.

337
00:47:14,565 --> 00:47:16,857
I wanted to talk about a student.

338
00:47:16,867 --> 00:47:18,792
Ishaan Awasti, 3rd "D"

339
00:47:18,802 --> 00:47:19,760
He's a new student.

340
00:47:19,770 --> 00:47:24,020
Some other teachers are
also complaining about him.

341
00:47:25,976 --> 00:47:29,631
I don't think he could
even complete a year.

342
00:47:29,646 --> 00:47:31,771
No sir, he's a smart boy.

343
00:47:32,416 --> 00:47:35,175
He has just come problem
in reading and writing.

344
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:37,395
You know about "Dyslexia".

345
00:47:41,825 --> 00:47:43,950
You've made our job easy.

346
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:49,423
I was confused what to tell his father.
He came through our trustees.

347
00:47:49,433 --> 00:47:51,433
Good, good.

348
00:47:51,468 --> 00:47:54,561
Then Special School is perfect for him.
Isn't it?

349
00:47:54,571 --> 00:47:56,129
No sir,

350
00:47:56,139 --> 00:47:59,879
He's a child with above
average intelligence.

351
00:48:00,444 --> 00:48:02,769
He has full right to study
in a normal school.

352
00:48:02,779 --> 00:48:05,839
He just needs a little help from us.

353
00:48:06,583 --> 00:48:12,783
All children around the world having
any problem study in normal school.

354
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:19,740
And these children have right
to study in any normal school.

355
00:48:19,997 --> 00:48:24,191
I'm sorry sir, it's not me who say
this. It's the law of our country.

356
00:48:24,201 --> 00:48:28,161
Under the law of rights of
education, every child gets this right.

357
00:48:28,171 --> 00:48:33,400
It's another thing that there are less
schools who don't follow this law.

358
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:38,085
Nikum, tell me one thing.
How will this boy manage here?

359
00:48:38,382 --> 00:48:41,508
There's math, history, geography,
science, language...

360
00:48:41,518 --> 00:48:44,211
He will.
Only if teachers help him a bit.

361
00:48:44,221 --> 00:48:46,513
Where's the time that teachers have?

362
00:48:46,523 --> 00:48:49,616
To attend one child
among 40 children?

363
00:48:49,626 --> 00:48:50,751
Impossible.

364
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:54,154
Sir, it won't take as much time
as you think.

365
00:48:54,164 --> 00:48:56,164
2-3 hours a week.

366
00:48:56,566 --> 00:48:58,566
I will show you.

367
00:48:58,802 --> 00:49:02,229
And he has to just pass all these
subjects,

368
00:49:02,239 --> 00:49:04,765
his real destination is something else.

369
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:10,179
So, all the subjects that we teach
are useless but yours isn't.

370
00:49:10,747 --> 00:49:15,167
No, sir, I didn't mean that.
every child has his art.

371
00:49:22,225 --> 00:49:25,030
Please sir, look at his painting.

372
00:49:31,768 --> 00:49:34,161
It's a battlefield, soldier digs a mine

373
00:49:34,171 --> 00:49:37,297
and turned the page and
escaped while digging.

374
00:49:37,307 --> 00:49:42,336
What an idea? Confident brush
strokes, such bold use of colors.

375
00:49:42,346 --> 00:49:44,346
Very bold.

376
00:49:45,182 --> 00:49:50,707
Look at this sir, a flip book,
story about getting away from home.

377
00:49:52,289 --> 00:49:55,859
What an idea?
From just an 8 years old boy.

378
00:49:57,327 --> 00:50:01,221
Sir, there are a few who
could think out of the way.

379
00:50:01,231 --> 00:50:04,801
Sir, just one chance.
He needs this chance.

380
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:07,460
Or he'll loose his faith.

381
00:50:09,806 --> 00:50:11,931
What do you want from me?

382
00:50:12,109 --> 00:50:16,970
For some time, his spellings and
writing should be ignored.

383
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:19,639
We should take his tests orally.

384
00:50:19,649 --> 00:50:22,209
Education is real be it
oral or written.

385
00:50:22,219 --> 00:50:24,711
By the time, I'll also work
on his reading and writing.

386
00:50:24,721 --> 00:50:27,441
That will be improved gradually.

387
00:50:32,162 --> 00:50:38,792
I don't know, if I'm doing a permanent
damage by following a temporary teacher.

388
00:52:46,763 --> 00:52:48,763
Now add 3

389
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,800
Very good, now add 5

390
00:52:54,571 --> 00:52:55,762
What did you get?

391
00:52:55,772 --> 00:52:58,366
Very good, now subtract 1 1

392
00:54:25,562 --> 00:54:29,489
There's a question. Have you ever
painted after you finished your school.

393
00:54:29,499 --> 00:54:31,499
What?

394
00:54:35,138 --> 00:54:36,529
What is this sir?

395
00:54:36,539 --> 00:54:41,129
Painting competition.
For students, teachers, everyone.

396
00:54:46,283 --> 00:54:49,142
Seriously, what's the meaning of art.

397
00:54:49,152 --> 00:54:52,127
It's meant to release your
emotions.

398
00:54:52,455 --> 00:54:56,950
If you're happy, your hand will
reach all bright colors.

399
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:02,570
Lunch was bad, you'll end up
filling with all dark and dull colors.

400
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:10,782
I'll be back in two minutes, friends.

401
00:55:16,112 --> 00:55:18,662
Sorry, there's a little space.

402
00:55:21,818 --> 00:55:23,543
How come you're here?

403
00:55:23,553 --> 00:55:25,345
I was passing by.

404
00:55:25,355 --> 00:55:28,548
Have you met Ishaan?
- No, not yet, I will meet him.

405
00:55:28,558 --> 00:55:31,108
First I needed to talk to you.

406
00:55:31,561 --> 00:55:33,561
Go ahead.

407
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:38,077
My wife has been surfing internet
for a few days.

408
00:55:38,101 --> 00:55:42,181
She has read all the information
about "Dyslexia"

409
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:44,397
We just wanted to you tell you that.

410
00:55:44,407 --> 00:55:46,787
Why did you want to tell me?

411
00:55:47,277 --> 00:55:53,238
So you don't mistake us as parents
who don't care about their children.

412
00:55:57,454 --> 00:56:00,787
To care.
It necessary Mr. Awasti.

413
00:56:02,926 --> 00:56:05,051
It has the power to cure.

414
00:56:06,429 --> 00:56:09,404
It's a medicine that relieves pain.

415
00:56:11,735 --> 00:56:16,329
It's a security that child thinks
someone cares about him.

416
00:56:16,339 --> 00:56:18,719
One hug, or one lovely kiss.

417
00:56:19,676 --> 00:56:22,201
To show that you care.

418
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:26,530
To tell him, "Son I love you".

419
00:56:28,184 --> 00:56:31,444
"If you have any worries,
you can come to me".

420
00:56:31,454 --> 00:56:35,704
"It's ok if you made a mistake,
I'm there for you."

421
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:41,562
To care.

422
00:56:44,834 --> 00:56:47,639
Isn't it what's called "to care"?

423
00:56:59,149 --> 00:57:03,381
I'm happy to hear that you
think you care.

424
00:57:14,631 --> 00:57:16,631
I'll leave now.

425
00:57:18,401 --> 00:57:20,401
Mr. Awasti,

426
00:57:21,070 --> 00:57:25,490
Has your wife read about
Solomon Islands on internet?

427
00:57:28,711 --> 00:57:30,711
I don't know.

428
00:57:31,514 --> 00:57:36,699
In Solomon Island, when people
wanted to clean a part of woods

429
00:57:36,719 --> 00:57:42,924
for farming, they don't cut the trees.
Instead, they stand around the tree

430
00:57:42,992 --> 00:57:47,326
and start shouting at him,
cursing at him.

431
00:57:52,068 --> 00:57:56,095
In some days,
the tree gets weak.

432
00:57:57,874 --> 00:57:59,874
And dies by itself.

433
00:59:57,160 --> 01:00:02,325
There has been great gems
in the world who changed it.

434
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:06,200
because..

435
01:00:06,536 --> 01:00:10,531
They were able to see
the world from their eyes.

436
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:13,645
Their minds were a bit different.

437
01:00:13,743 --> 01:00:18,078
People didn't like that and
they came in their ways.

438
01:00:18,781 --> 01:00:21,716
But still they won.

439
01:00:23,353 --> 01:00:28,028
And they won like that the whole
world saw it in an awe.

440
01:01:50,873 --> 01:01:53,508
What a fair they have arranged?

441
01:01:54,077 --> 01:01:56,077
Look, I have arrived.

442
01:02:15,064 --> 01:02:18,091
Where's your Ishaan?
I've been dying to meet him.

443
01:02:18,101 --> 01:02:20,526
I don't know,
I can't see him.

444
01:02:20,536 --> 01:02:22,295
Rajan, where's Ishaan?

445
01:02:22,305 --> 01:02:26,065
I don't know sir,
he left hostel before everyone.

446
01:02:26,075 --> 01:02:28,075
Really?

447
01:02:36,419 --> 01:02:39,904
Hey Nikum, you've pulled
me into this too.

448
01:02:40,289 --> 01:02:41,414
You should try this,
it's fun.

449
01:02:41,424 --> 01:02:44,654
No way, I can't do this
painting thing.

450
01:02:48,264 --> 01:02:52,939
I will put so many alphabets
and fill it will alphabets.

451
01:02:53,236 --> 01:02:56,562
I've come here only for headmaster
to see my presence.

452
01:02:56,572 --> 01:03:00,233
I will be here for 5-10 minutes only.
I will not make my Sunday waste

453
01:03:00,243 --> 01:03:02,001
It's an honor for us that
you've come.

454
01:03:02,011 --> 01:03:03,469
Where I have to sit?

455
01:03:03,479 --> 01:03:06,038
Children will show your sitting place.

456
01:03:06,048 --> 01:03:08,048
Children, come here.

457
01:03:09,051 --> 01:03:11,601
Show to sir his sitting place.

458
01:04:01,737 --> 01:04:04,672
My special guest Madam Lalita

459
01:04:04,974 --> 01:04:08,068
Teacher, painter, my guru.

460
01:04:08,911 --> 01:04:10,911
Hello
- Hello

461
01:04:20,957 --> 01:04:22,548
Have you seen Ishaan?

462
01:04:22,558 --> 01:04:25,527
No sir, he must be with Rajan.

463
01:05:07,036 --> 01:05:08,594
Where's he?

464
01:05:08,604 --> 01:05:13,619
I don't know sir, as I said earlier
he left before everyone.

465
01:06:01,223 --> 01:06:04,124
Where had you been?
Come here, sit.

466
01:06:08,731 --> 01:06:10,731
Do you have colors?

467
01:08:34,910 --> 01:08:39,670
Sir, haven't you left yet?
You were leaving in 5 minutes.

468
01:08:42,518 --> 01:08:43,809
What are you painting?

469
01:08:43,819 --> 01:08:46,454
It's a frog, duck and a banana.

470
01:08:46,589 --> 01:08:48,589
Is it a frog?

471
01:10:35,831 --> 01:10:38,459
How's my painting?
Look at it.

472
01:10:39,668 --> 01:10:43,153
Absolutely beautiful sir.
First prize sir.

473
01:13:39,882 --> 01:13:42,817
Amazing!
What a wonderful morning.

474
01:13:44,019 --> 01:13:48,609
Going through the colored
glasses of windows we reached

475
01:13:48,824 --> 01:13:50,824
our childhood.

476
01:13:50,859 --> 01:13:52,859
Praise to be God's.

477
01:13:53,262 --> 01:13:55,654
I saw other's childhoods too.

478
01:13:55,664 --> 01:13:57,874
We made Joy sir to promise

479
01:13:58,500 --> 01:14:01,193
He will take compulsory
lessons from Nikum Sir.

480
01:14:01,203 --> 01:14:03,203
Isn't it Joy Sir?

481
01:14:06,008 --> 01:14:09,301
But not only me, Sen and Tiwari
Sir will too,

482
01:14:09,311 --> 01:14:12,371
these two had bad paintings as well.

483
01:14:15,017 --> 01:14:16,675
All right.

484
01:14:16,685 --> 01:14:18,644
By Nikum, I just remember.

485
01:14:18,654 --> 01:14:24,217
That we won't have to look
for a new art teacher.

486
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:30,285
Nikum sir, along with Tulip School,
will also teach in our school.

487
01:14:43,345 --> 01:14:47,111
Now, what you have been waiting for...

488
01:14:47,883 --> 01:14:50,178
I'm going to announce that.

489
01:14:50,385 --> 01:14:53,955
Let me come to the results
of the Art Fair.

490
01:14:54,223 --> 01:14:58,319
Our special guest Madam Lalita
was in a fix.

491
01:14:59,261 --> 01:15:03,422
She was in a confusion. she was
confused between two paintings

492
01:15:03,432 --> 01:15:10,099
It was a tie. She wanted to award
both paintings to be the best.

493
01:15:10,873 --> 01:15:15,173
That wasn't possible.
Because the winner painting

494
01:15:16,512 --> 01:15:22,972
I thought that painting will become the
front cover of the school's yearbook.

495
01:15:23,585 --> 01:15:26,645
Now, there can't be two
front covers.

496
01:15:28,090 --> 01:15:30,090
So what to do now?

497
01:15:31,527 --> 01:15:33,907
Madam was in deep confusion.

498
01:15:34,229 --> 01:15:38,054
After thinking a lot she
came to a conclusion.

499
01:15:38,567 --> 01:15:43,095
She selected the student
leaving the teacher.

500
01:15:45,507 --> 01:15:47,507
Yes children.

501
01:15:47,543 --> 01:15:51,138
Your Nikum sir has been defeated.

502
01:15:54,716 --> 01:15:57,436
And the student who defeated him

503
01:15:59,254 --> 01:16:05,591
Little, 9 years old,
Ishaan Nandkishore Awasti.

504
01:16:50,138 --> 01:16:52,138
Applause.

505
01:19:08,777 --> 01:19:12,713
Here's your Ishaan
and here's his painting.

506
01:19:13,882 --> 01:19:16,857
Just look at it, what
a masterpiece.

507
01:19:16,885 --> 01:19:21,475
He's a very talented boy.
I'm really happy to have him.

508
01:19:21,757 --> 01:19:23,882
Have you met his teachers?

509
01:19:23,892 --> 01:19:25,283
No sir.

510
01:19:25,293 --> 01:19:30,648
Please go ahead and meet them,
they'll give the progress report.

511
01:19:54,856 --> 01:19:58,150
First we thought something was
wrong, he won't be staying here.

512
01:19:58,160 --> 01:20:00,625
But what improvement he made.

513
01:20:01,463 --> 01:20:07,333
What a pace to pick-up he has.
Wonderful. Here's his progress report.

514
01:20:15,510 --> 01:20:17,720
Your Son is very talented.

515
01:20:18,446 --> 01:20:22,314
I can't believe all this.
Thank you.

516
01:20:51,980 --> 01:20:54,346
What?
What happened?

517
01:20:57,752 --> 01:21:00,387
I can't find words to
thank you.
