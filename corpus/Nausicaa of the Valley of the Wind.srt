Tokuma Shoten and Hakuhodo present

3
00:01:24,546 --> 00:01:26,798
Another village destroyed

4
00:01:34,807 --> 00:01:38,309
Let's go, soon, this will also
be consumed in the Sea of Decay

5
00:01:48,612 --> 00:01:51,364
1 ,000 years after the collapse
of industrial civilization,

6
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:53,908
the Sea of Decay, a swamp
exuding toxic vapors,

7
00:01:54,034 --> 00:01:56,452
covered an earth strewn
with rusting ruins,

8
00:01:56,578 --> 00:01:57,954
threatening human survival

00:04:56,174 --> 00:04:58,009
An Ohm's tracks

17
00:05:05,559 --> 00:05:07,310
They're still fresh

18
00:05:23,994 --> 00:05:25,703
An Ohm's shell

19
00:05:37,257 --> 00:05:39,050
Amazing

20
00:05:39,593 --> 00:05:42,261
I've never seen a perfect shell

21
00:05:50,228 --> 00:05:52,605
Lovely sound

22
00:06:00,364 --> 00:06:02,281
It chipped my ceramic sword

23
00:06:02,407 --> 00:06:04,450
The villagers will be pleased

24
00:06:05,118 --> 00:06:08,746
They'll have plenty to
make into tools now

25
00:06:13,251 --> 00:06:15,252
What an eye

26
00:06:15,796 --> 00:06:18,047
I wonder if I can carry it

27
00:06:46,952 --> 00:06:48,494
It came free

28
00:06:49,579 --> 00:06:52,623
It's incredibly light

29
00:07:05,804 --> 00:07:08,514
Mushigo Palm spores

30
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:28,033
So beautiful...

31
00:07:28,743 --> 00:07:31,704
Though in this forest of death,
your lungs would rot

32
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:33,789
in 5 minutes without a mask

33
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:55,728
Who is that?

34
00:08:04,529 --> 00:08:06,238
What can it be?

35
00:08:08,325 --> 00:08:10,159
My heart's pounding

36
00:08:12,537 --> 00:08:14,038
Those are gunshots

37
00:08:14,164 --> 00:08:15,915
An insect is
attacking someone

38
00:08:22,255 --> 00:08:23,714
Oh, I'm sorry!

39
00:08:40,398 --> 00:08:41,524
Over there!

40
00:08:41,858 --> 00:08:44,235
What a thick spore cloud

41
00:08:46,029 --> 00:08:46,779
An Ohm!

42
00:08:46,905 --> 00:08:48,572
That must have been its shell

43
00:08:52,577 --> 00:08:54,411
Don't run that way

44
00:09:01,962 --> 00:09:03,587
Look this way!

45
00:09:06,424 --> 00:09:08,592
They answered!
They're coming

46
00:09:41,793 --> 00:09:42,793
Who's that?

47
00:10:01,521 --> 00:10:03,606
What a magnificent Ohm

48
00:10:09,613 --> 00:10:10,487
Go upwind!

49
00:10:10,655 --> 00:10:11,822
Thank you!

50
00:10:14,326 --> 00:10:16,160
Return to the forest, Ohm

51
00:10:16,328 --> 00:10:19,121
This is not your world

52
00:10:19,706 --> 00:10:21,040
Be a good boy

53
00:10:23,501 --> 00:10:25,127
It's blinded by rage

54
00:10:25,253 --> 00:10:26,587
I've got to calm him

55
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:59,870
The flares stunned it

56
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:02,498
An insect charm

57
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:12,466
Awaken, Ohm

58
00:11:12,592 --> 00:11:14,218
Return to the forest

59
00:11:24,896 --> 00:11:25,896
It's awake

60
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:47,751
The Ohm's returning to the forest

61
00:11:47,877 --> 00:11:51,588
She tamed that Ohm with
flares and an insect charm

62
00:12:33,798 --> 00:12:34,798
Lord Yupa!

63
00:12:38,219 --> 00:12:39,803
Nausicaä
I hardly recognized you

64
00:12:39,971 --> 00:12:41,430
It's been a year and half

65
00:12:41,556 --> 00:12:42,806
Father will be glad

66
00:12:43,183 --> 00:12:44,641
I must thank you

67
00:12:44,809 --> 00:12:46,810
You've become a great wind-rider

68
00:12:47,103 --> 00:12:49,813
Oh, no, not according to father

69
00:12:51,775 --> 00:12:55,319
Oh, of course
I'd completely forgotten about him

70
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:01,533
A fox-squirrel
I've never seen one

71
00:13:01,701 --> 00:13:05,287
When a winged insect snatched him,
I took him for a human child

72
00:13:05,413 --> 00:13:07,206
I had to fire my gun

73
00:13:07,332 --> 00:13:09,333
That's what enraged the Ohm

74
00:13:10,168 --> 00:13:13,128
He'd fainted so was
spared the poison

75
00:13:13,338 --> 00:13:16,882
Better not touch him
Even young, they're savage

76
00:13:17,008 --> 00:13:18,008
Come

77
00:13:18,301 --> 00:13:19,510
Here

78
00:13:20,011 --> 00:13:21,678
Hey...

79
00:13:23,556 --> 00:13:27,851
You're not scared

80
00:13:31,022 --> 00:13:32,898
See... you're not scared

81
00:13:36,027 --> 00:13:36,860
See...

82
00:13:45,411 --> 00:13:47,454
You were just frightened

83
00:13:52,794 --> 00:13:55,087
Lord Yupa, may I have him?

84
00:13:55,588 --> 00:13:57,089
Why certainly...

85
00:13:58,383 --> 00:13:59,508
Thank you

86
00:13:59,634 --> 00:14:02,344
Kai and Kui
Remember me?

87
00:14:03,388 --> 00:14:05,347
A mysterious power

88
00:14:06,558 --> 00:14:09,685
You must be tired
You ran so far

89
00:14:13,147 --> 00:14:15,232
Is everyone well?

90
00:14:18,027 --> 00:14:19,069
What's wrong?

91
00:14:20,238 --> 00:14:21,905
My father...

92
00:14:23,241 --> 00:14:25,075
He can no longer fly

93
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:26,660
Jihl...

94
00:14:27,537 --> 00:14:30,080
The forest poisons?

95
00:14:30,665 --> 00:14:31,623
Yes

96
00:14:31,749 --> 00:14:34,543
He says it's fate for those
living by the Sea of Decay

97
00:14:35,795 --> 00:14:38,297
I should have come sooner

98
00:14:39,549 --> 00:14:40,757
Oh, no

99
00:14:42,051 --> 00:14:44,303
Thank you for coming

100
00:14:44,929 --> 00:14:48,765
Lord Yupa, there's something
I want to show you

101
00:14:48,975 --> 00:14:50,809
My secret room

102
00:14:51,144 --> 00:14:53,770
It's a secret
I don't want to scare them

103
00:14:53,897 --> 00:14:55,939
I'll tell them you're coming

104
00:14:56,482 --> 00:14:58,275
Come soon!

105
00:14:59,444 --> 00:15:01,194
Lord Yupa

106
00:15:02,155 --> 00:15:04,323
Would you carry this?

107
00:15:04,449 --> 00:15:06,742
It's hard to fly with

108
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:20,005
She certainly reads the wind well

109
00:15:20,131 --> 00:15:22,215
Not far now

110
00:15:57,835 --> 00:15:59,044
Oh...
Lord Yupa

111
00:15:59,170 --> 00:15:59,878
Welcome

112
00:16:00,004 --> 00:16:01,672
Are you in good health?

113
00:16:03,216 --> 00:16:06,677
The waters and winds
are clear and calm

114
00:16:07,261 --> 00:16:08,220
Lord Yupa

115
00:16:08,346 --> 00:16:10,681
Hello all, you're well

116
00:16:25,238 --> 00:16:27,197
Lord Yupa

117
00:16:29,117 --> 00:16:31,326
We've missed you

118
00:16:34,414 --> 00:16:36,415
Princess, he has come

119
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:38,041
Wait

120
00:16:38,584 --> 00:16:39,751
Lord Yupa

121
00:16:40,586 --> 00:16:42,754
Old Mito, you're hard at work

122
00:16:43,089 --> 00:16:47,300
Tonight I'll hear
tales of your travels

123
00:16:48,261 --> 00:16:50,262
OK, start it

124
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:02,107
Seems to work

125
00:17:02,233 --> 00:17:03,400
Yes

126
00:17:06,362 --> 00:17:08,780
This is excellent

127
00:17:08,906 --> 00:17:12,409
Tomorrow, we'll send
people to get the rest

128
00:17:12,702 --> 00:17:14,494
Come, Toeto

129
00:17:15,538 --> 00:17:18,540
Lord Yupa
This is Toeto's baby, born this year

130
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:20,917
Oh, let's have a look

131
00:17:21,586 --> 00:17:23,253
A fine baby

132
00:17:23,379 --> 00:17:26,214
Reminds me of Nausicaä
as a baby

133
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:29,259
Please be her godfather

134
00:17:29,385 --> 00:17:32,262
Name her that a fair wind
may favor her

135
00:17:33,056 --> 00:17:34,264
I will indeed

136
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:36,475
I'll find her a fine name

137
00:17:37,018 --> 00:17:38,185
Thank you

138
00:17:38,311 --> 00:17:41,772
May she grow up
as strong as our Princess

139
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:45,984
She's as strong as they come

140
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:48,612
But we won't want her
playing in the Sea of Decay

141
00:17:48,863 --> 00:17:51,490
But that's where
I found the Ohm shell

142
00:17:51,824 --> 00:17:54,951
Put yourself in my shoes
I'm responsible for this castle

143
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:57,788
She's made me sick with worry

144
00:17:58,831 --> 00:18:03,251
Let her play in the Sea of Decay
if she finds us Ohm shells

145
00:18:03,377 --> 00:18:06,838
Indeed, her presence
there saved me

146
00:18:40,164 --> 00:18:43,041
Saved by the girl?

147
00:18:43,501 --> 00:18:47,546
This is a fine valley
Being here calms my spirits

148
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,590
How was your journey?

149
00:18:51,676 --> 00:18:52,968
It was terrible

150
00:18:53,094 --> 00:18:56,555
The Sea of Decay consumed
2 more countries to the south

151
00:18:57,348 --> 00:19:00,100
It's spreading all the time

152
00:19:00,226 --> 00:19:03,311
And yet war and hunger
are everywhere

153
00:19:03,437 --> 00:19:05,564
Nothing but bad omens

154
00:19:06,065 --> 00:19:09,067
Why can't they live
as you do in this valley?

155
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:14,239
The ocean winds protect our valley

156
00:19:14,365 --> 00:19:17,367
The Sea of Decay
can't reach us here

157
00:19:17,827 --> 00:19:19,119
What do you say, Yupa?

158
00:19:19,245 --> 00:19:22,789
Isn't it time you
settled in this valley?

159
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:25,333
Look at my condition

160
00:19:25,459 --> 00:19:27,752
It would please everyone

161
00:19:28,379 --> 00:19:30,088
Don't bother

162
00:19:30,214 --> 00:19:35,302
Yupa's a man who is fated
to search forever

163
00:19:36,679 --> 00:19:38,388
Fate, huh...

164
00:19:38,931 --> 00:19:41,099
Obaba, what's
he searching for?

165
00:19:41,225 --> 00:19:45,353
Oh, my, don't you
know, Nausicaä?

166
00:19:45,479 --> 00:19:48,899
Look, see the tapestry on the wall...

167
00:19:49,442 --> 00:19:51,526
I no longer see it

168
00:19:51,652 --> 00:19:55,447
The figure in the left corner

169
00:19:56,407 --> 00:20:00,577
"...clothed in blue robes,

170
00:20:00,703 --> 00:20:03,997
"descending onto a golden field,

171
00:20:04,123 --> 00:20:08,752
"to join bonds
with the great earth

172
00:20:09,253 --> 00:20:13,757
"and guide the people
to the pure land, at last"

173
00:20:14,133 --> 00:20:18,261
Lord Yupa, I always thought
that was only a legend

174
00:20:18,387 --> 00:20:21,097
You mustn't tease me, Obaba

175
00:20:21,224 --> 00:20:23,767
It's the same thing

176
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:28,772
I only wish to solve
the Sea of Decay's mysteries

177
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:32,234
Are we humans but a tribe
destined to be swallowed

178
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:35,445
and ruined by the Sea of Decay?

179
00:20:35,571 --> 00:20:38,448
That is what I wish to know

180
00:20:51,671 --> 00:20:55,465
If only I could help Lord Yupa...

181
00:21:12,984 --> 00:21:15,485
Princess, Princess

182
00:21:16,112 --> 00:21:17,487
What is it, Mito?

183
00:21:17,613 --> 00:21:19,990
A strange scent on the wind

184
00:21:20,866 --> 00:21:22,993
It's nearly dawn
I'll be right there

185
00:21:30,668 --> 00:21:32,043
How is it?

186
00:21:32,169 --> 00:21:35,297
It's one fine storm,
but something's amiss

187
00:21:53,941 --> 00:21:54,733
Over there!

188
00:21:55,484 --> 00:21:57,027
Look!

189
00:22:02,533 --> 00:22:03,575
It's a ship

190
00:22:03,701 --> 00:22:06,036
Why would a ship be here?

191
00:22:07,788 --> 00:22:09,122
What is it?

192
00:22:09,248 --> 00:22:10,540
Lord Yupa
It's a ship

193
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:11,541
A ship!

194
00:22:11,667 --> 00:22:12,542
It's coming closer

195
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:19,716
It's huge!

196
00:22:29,477 --> 00:22:30,935
It's a Tolmekian ship

197
00:22:31,062 --> 00:22:32,228
It's not flying right

198
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:34,439
It's an emergency landing

199
00:22:34,565 --> 00:22:36,232
Help me up, Gol

200
00:22:37,026 --> 00:22:38,568
Princess, you mustn't!

201
00:22:38,694 --> 00:22:40,278
I'll guide them to the shore

202
00:22:43,949 --> 00:22:45,075
It's coming about

203
00:22:45,368 --> 00:22:46,868
Off you go!

204
00:22:47,953 --> 00:22:48,620
Teto!

205
00:23:17,316 --> 00:23:18,483
How dare they!

206
00:23:18,609 --> 00:23:20,985
They must have landed before
and killed some insects

207
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,990
Turn away!
You'll crash!

208
00:23:26,742 --> 00:23:28,451
Turn away!

209
00:23:31,789 --> 00:23:33,748
Turn!

210
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,596
It crashed

211
00:23:48,722 --> 00:23:49,639
The Princess

212
00:23:49,974 --> 00:23:50,932
The cliffs

213
00:23:51,058 --> 00:23:52,308
Let's go!

214
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:54,561
Everyone to the rescue

215
00:23:54,687 --> 00:23:56,312
Even the boys!

216
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:23,798
It's that girl, she's alive

217
00:24:43,235 --> 00:24:44,360
Where am I...

218
00:24:44,487 --> 00:24:46,571
The Valley of the Wind
Save your strength

219
00:25:01,295 --> 00:25:02,879
My name is...

220
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:06,674
Lastel of Pejite

221
00:25:07,092 --> 00:25:09,260
My cargo...
Burn the cargo...

222
00:25:09,595 --> 00:25:10,803
The cargo...

223
00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:12,764
Please, burn it

224
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:14,766
Your cargo, I understand

225
00:25:14,892 --> 00:25:16,768
Don't worry
It's all in flames

226
00:25:19,146 --> 00:25:20,772
Thank goodness

227
00:25:20,898 --> 00:25:22,482
Princess!

228
00:25:32,284 --> 00:25:35,578
That's...
The Princess of Pejite

229
00:25:46,674 --> 00:25:48,800
An insect!
An Ushiabu's alive

230
00:25:53,138 --> 00:25:55,139
Oh, no, it's calling its friends

231
00:25:55,266 --> 00:25:56,599
It can't fly

232
00:25:56,725 --> 00:25:57,433
Bring guns!

233
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:00,103
No, if you shoot it,
it'll call others

234
00:26:00,437 --> 00:26:01,437
I'll kill it now

235
00:26:01,605 --> 00:26:03,356
Guns won't kill an Ushiabu

236
00:26:03,482 --> 00:26:04,732
Then what!

237
00:26:04,858 --> 00:26:06,150
Wait

238
00:26:06,277 --> 00:26:08,361
Mito
Bring my glider

239
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:11,364
Princess!

240
00:26:27,423 --> 00:26:28,506
Return to the forest

241
00:26:28,632 --> 00:26:30,258
You're strong, you can fly

242
00:26:39,268 --> 00:26:40,768
That's a good boy

243
00:26:42,896 --> 00:26:43,563
Princess

244
00:26:43,689 --> 00:26:45,023
Thanks

245
00:27:07,755 --> 00:27:08,921
Thank God

246
00:27:09,048 --> 00:27:13,384
No telling how we'd suffer for
even a single insect's death

247
00:28:10,818 --> 00:28:12,402
An Ohm...

248
00:29:10,794 --> 00:29:12,795
Found one!
Come!

249
00:29:13,964 --> 00:29:15,047
Here!

250
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,634
So those were spores
stuck to that ship

251
00:29:18,761 --> 00:29:20,678
They haven't released
any toxins yet

252
00:29:25,476 --> 00:29:26,726
We're almost done

253
00:29:26,852 --> 00:29:29,187
I know
We can't miss a single one

254
00:29:36,987 --> 00:29:39,071
What on earth is this?

255
00:29:39,198 --> 00:29:41,699
The fire didn't destroy it...

256
00:29:42,326 --> 00:29:44,952
Leave this mystery
for later, folks

257
00:29:45,078 --> 00:29:47,455
Go and help burn the spores

258
00:29:48,665 --> 00:29:50,500
Be careful, now

259
00:29:52,211 --> 00:29:54,337
Why'd she bring this
bundle of trouble here

260
00:29:54,463 --> 00:29:56,547
Mito, look here

261
00:30:02,596 --> 00:30:06,015
It's pulsing
Almost like it's alive

262
00:30:07,392 --> 00:30:09,018
Lord Yupa, what is this...

263
00:30:09,561 --> 00:30:12,730
On my journey
I heard ominous rumors...

264
00:30:12,856 --> 00:30:16,025
That a monster from the
old world that had slept

265
00:30:16,151 --> 00:30:17,735
beneath Pejite,
had been unearthed

266
00:30:18,529 --> 00:30:20,238
A monster from the old world?

267
00:30:20,781 --> 00:30:22,073
Giant Warriors...

268
00:30:22,199 --> 00:30:23,032
The Giant Warriors!

269
00:30:23,158 --> 00:30:26,828
They say they were destroyed
in the Seven Days of Fire

270
00:30:27,913 --> 00:30:29,247
This...

271
00:30:35,504 --> 00:30:39,549
The Giant Warriors were all
said to have turned to stone

272
00:30:42,803 --> 00:30:47,265
But a single one slept in
the earth for 1 ,000 years

273
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:52,270
In... In a way, the thing
looks almost human

274
00:30:52,646 --> 00:30:56,858
Tolmekia's a savage military state,
far to our west

275
00:30:57,067 --> 00:31:00,278
And remember the Pejite
captive who perished...

276
00:31:04,199 --> 00:31:05,783
Keep up the good work

277
00:31:16,545 --> 00:31:17,753
What's that?

278
00:31:40,736 --> 00:31:42,153
Tolmekian ships!

279
00:31:42,279 --> 00:31:43,613
Everyone to the castle!

280
00:31:51,747 --> 00:31:53,456
To the castle!

281
00:31:53,624 --> 00:31:55,708
Gather in the castle!

282
00:31:55,834 --> 00:31:57,126
The castle!

283
00:31:59,129 --> 00:32:00,463
Father!

284
00:32:11,141 --> 00:32:13,559
Obaba, hide yourself

285
00:32:13,685 --> 00:32:15,478
I'll stay right where I am

286
00:32:33,789 --> 00:32:35,247
Princess!

287
00:32:49,346 --> 00:32:50,513
How dare you!

288
00:33:14,538 --> 00:33:15,705
Nausicaä...

289
00:33:20,919 --> 00:33:22,169
Stay where you are!

290
00:33:22,879 --> 00:33:25,339
Move and this sword,
carved of insect shell

291
00:33:25,465 --> 00:33:28,175
will pierce your ceramic armor

292
00:33:28,677 --> 00:33:30,177
That's Yupa...

293
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:32,596
I ask you Tolmekian warriors

294
00:33:32,723 --> 00:33:37,560
Last night, these villagers toiled
desperately to save one of your ships

295
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:41,731
We have just now gently
laid one of your dead to rest

296
00:33:41,898 --> 00:33:46,736
Is this how you Tolmekians treat
such a nation, however weak!

297
00:33:46,862 --> 00:33:50,239
If you would make war,
you must have reasons

298
00:33:50,365 --> 00:33:53,701
You should first send a messenger
to declare them

299
00:33:57,456 --> 00:34:00,249
Nausicaä...
Be calm, Nausicaä

300
00:34:00,792 --> 00:34:04,253
If you fight now,
they will slaughter the villagers

301
00:34:04,921 --> 00:34:07,757
We must survive
Wait for our chance

302
00:34:08,216 --> 00:34:10,134
You...

303
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:11,594
Little wench

304
00:34:12,054 --> 00:34:13,304
Put it down, Kurotowa

305
00:34:13,597 --> 00:34:14,764
But...

306
00:34:17,601 --> 00:34:20,811
Look at this mess
Killed them all

307
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:23,564
Your rebuke stings

308
00:34:24,191 --> 00:34:27,485
Are you Yupamiralda,
the greatest swordsman of this region?

309
00:34:29,112 --> 00:34:31,280
We have not come for slaughter
We wish to talk

310
00:34:31,406 --> 00:34:33,491
Lay down your sword

311
00:35:13,657 --> 00:35:14,907
The Princess!

312
00:35:15,033 --> 00:35:16,367
Princess!

313
00:35:20,539 --> 00:35:21,872
Listen well!

314
00:35:21,998 --> 00:35:24,917
Her Highness Kushana, Division
Commander of the Tolmekian

315
00:35:25,043 --> 00:35:27,128
Frontier Forces will speak

316
00:35:27,712 --> 00:35:31,715
We have come to unify
the frontier nations

317
00:35:32,134 --> 00:35:35,177
and build peace in this region

318
00:35:36,096 --> 00:35:39,390
You live on the brink of extinction
beside the Sea of Decay

319
00:35:40,183 --> 00:35:43,686
Accept our rule
and join our enterprise

320
00:35:44,271 --> 00:35:47,898
We shall burn away the Sea of Decay
and resurrect the earth!

321
00:35:48,233 --> 00:35:49,275
Burn away the Sea of Decay

322
00:35:49,401 --> 00:35:50,901
Is that possible?

323
00:35:51,361 --> 00:35:54,613
We have revived the
miraculous skills and power

324
00:35:54,739 --> 00:35:58,200
that once allowed humans
to rule this earth

325
00:35:58,410 --> 00:36:00,119
For those who submit to us,

326
00:36:00,245 --> 00:36:04,540
I promise a life free from fear of
the toxins and insects of that swamp

327
00:36:08,712 --> 00:36:10,671
Wait!

328
00:36:14,134 --> 00:36:16,719
You must not harm the Sea of Decay

329
00:36:17,179 --> 00:36:18,762
What's that, you old hag

330
00:36:18,889 --> 00:36:20,389
Take her away

331
00:36:20,515 --> 00:36:21,724
Let her speak

332
00:36:23,059 --> 00:36:25,811
In the 1 ,000 years
of the Sea of Decay,

333
00:36:25,937 --> 00:36:30,566
countless times have humans
sought to burn it away

334
00:36:30,692 --> 00:36:34,987
Yet... each time herds
of Ohms, blind with rage,

335
00:36:35,113 --> 00:36:39,783
have swarmed the earth,
like a tidal wave

336
00:36:48,793 --> 00:36:52,379
Destroying nations,
swallowing cities,

337
00:36:52,505 --> 00:36:55,883
the Ohms' rage would not quiet

338
00:36:56,009 --> 00:36:59,261
until they starved to death

339
00:36:59,596 --> 00:37:03,098
In time, the spores

340
00:37:03,225 --> 00:37:06,227
took root in the Ohms' rotting flesh,

341
00:37:06,561 --> 00:37:10,564
and engulfed our vast
earth in this Sea of Decay

342
00:37:10,899 --> 00:37:13,442
You must not touch
the Sea of Decay

343
00:37:13,568 --> 00:37:16,320
Enough!
No more of your ravings

344
00:37:16,446 --> 00:37:18,322
Ah! What will you do?

345
00:37:18,448 --> 00:37:20,449
Kill me, too?

346
00:37:21,243 --> 00:37:21,951
You!

347
00:37:22,327 --> 00:37:23,911
Kill me if you will!

348
00:37:24,037 --> 00:37:27,498
Easy work to murder
an old blind woman

349
00:37:27,624 --> 00:37:29,667
Just as you murdered Jihl

350
00:37:30,085 --> 00:37:31,043
Not Jihl!

351
00:37:31,169 --> 00:37:34,088
How cruel!
He was helpless!

352
00:37:38,134 --> 00:37:39,134
Shut them up!

353
00:37:39,261 --> 00:37:40,678
Show no mercy to impudence!

354
00:37:41,304 --> 00:37:42,596
Wait, everyone!

355
00:37:42,722 --> 00:37:44,473
Please listen to me

356
00:37:48,603 --> 00:37:50,938
I don't want anymore sacrifices

357
00:37:52,274 --> 00:37:53,440
Please

358
00:37:55,151 --> 00:37:55,985
Princess...

359
00:37:57,946 --> 00:37:59,822
You, too, Obaba

360
00:38:00,198 --> 00:38:02,491
We must submit to these people

361
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,967
Step on it

362
00:38:30,979 --> 00:38:32,604
Hurry up

363
00:38:38,028 --> 00:38:39,987
It really is a lovely valley

364
00:38:40,113 --> 00:38:41,238
I'm against it

365
00:38:42,032 --> 00:38:45,534
We have orders to send the
Giant Warrior back at once

366
00:38:46,036 --> 00:38:48,037
An order we can't possibly fulfill

367
00:38:48,163 --> 00:38:52,124
Even our biggest ship
collapsed from its weight

368
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:55,544
But you can't be serious
about building a nation here...

369
00:38:55,754 --> 00:38:58,047
And what if I am?

370
00:38:58,214 --> 00:39:01,925
You expect me to hand over that
monster as a toy for those fools?

371
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:04,803
You have a point...

372
00:39:04,929 --> 00:39:06,972
I am but a simple soldier

373
00:39:07,098 --> 00:39:09,224
Such a decision is beyond my position

374
00:39:09,476 --> 00:39:11,518
You're a sly fox

375
00:39:15,565 --> 00:39:19,401
While I'm in Pejite, your priority
is to revive that Giant Warrior

376
00:39:19,527 --> 00:39:20,235
Yes

377
00:39:21,071 --> 00:39:22,571
Can this gun ship fly?

378
00:39:22,697 --> 00:39:24,823
Yes, we found it here

379
00:39:26,076 --> 00:39:30,245
Get this straight
I'm not asking you

380
00:39:30,622 --> 00:39:33,290
But take the Princess to Pejite....

381
00:39:33,416 --> 00:39:35,876
5 hostages, the gun ship and food...

382
00:39:36,461 --> 00:39:38,003
You pick the hostages

383
00:39:38,129 --> 00:39:40,381
Prepare everything
for the morning

384
00:39:52,852 --> 00:39:54,186
Thanks for going as a hostage

385
00:39:54,312 --> 00:39:56,271
We're fine, but look

386
00:39:56,439 --> 00:39:58,774
They're taking everything in sight

387
00:39:59,609 --> 00:40:03,362
I will slip away, return in secret
and await my chance

388
00:40:03,488 --> 00:40:06,490
We must prevent that
monster's resurrection

389
00:40:06,616 --> 00:40:07,282
Yes

390
00:40:11,579 --> 00:40:12,788
Nausicaä

391
00:40:27,137 --> 00:40:30,180
Teto, where is she?

392
00:41:25,445 --> 00:41:28,363
Nausicaä! What on earth is this?

393
00:41:29,032 --> 00:41:31,158
These plants are from
the Sea of Decay

394
00:41:31,826 --> 00:41:34,828
I've grown them
from spores I collected

395
00:41:35,038 --> 00:41:37,164
Don't worry, they're not toxic

396
00:41:37,749 --> 00:41:39,875
Not toxic...

397
00:41:40,001 --> 00:41:43,045
The air here is pure indeed, but...

398
00:41:44,506 --> 00:41:48,050
Why... with this deadly poisonous
plant blooming

399
00:41:48,927 --> 00:41:51,470
The castle windmill draws

400
00:41:51,596 --> 00:41:54,056
water from deep within the earth

401
00:41:54,724 --> 00:41:57,768
The sand, too, comes from
the very bottom of the well

402
00:41:58,603 --> 00:42:00,395
With pure water and soil,

403
00:42:00,522 --> 00:42:03,565
the plants from the Sea of Decay
are not poisonous

404
00:42:04,108 --> 00:42:06,151
The pollution lies in the earth itself

405
00:42:06,277 --> 00:42:08,779
Even the earth of our valley

406
00:42:09,405 --> 00:42:10,280
Why...

407
00:42:11,366 --> 00:42:15,202
Who made such a
terrible mess of the world?

408
00:42:15,912 --> 00:42:17,788
Did you do this all yourself?

409
00:42:18,915 --> 00:42:19,915
Yes

410
00:42:20,041 --> 00:42:22,626
To cure my father's illness
and that of others

411
00:42:23,086 --> 00:42:24,378
But...

412
00:42:26,798 --> 00:42:28,882
I'm closing it down

413
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:33,762
I just shut off the water and
they'll soon wither and die

414
00:42:46,943 --> 00:42:48,610
Nausicaä

415
00:42:48,736 --> 00:42:51,446
I frighten myself

416
00:42:53,074 --> 00:42:56,451
I don't know what my rage
will make me do

417
00:42:57,245 --> 00:42:59,788
I don't want to kill anyone

418
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:33,196
Princess

419
00:43:34,365 --> 00:43:35,574
We gathered these for you

420
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:36,533
Chiko nuts

421
00:43:36,659 --> 00:43:38,452
They're for you

422
00:43:40,163 --> 00:43:41,663
All of you...

423
00:43:42,957 --> 00:43:44,333
So many

424
00:43:44,542 --> 00:43:46,126
You've worked so hard

425
00:43:48,212 --> 00:43:49,546
Thank you

426
00:43:50,048 --> 00:43:51,381
They're very precious

427
00:43:51,507 --> 00:43:52,674
It's not fair, Princess

428
00:43:53,134 --> 00:43:54,676
All aboard!
We're taking off

429
00:43:55,178 --> 00:43:56,762
There, now

430
00:43:57,013 --> 00:43:58,889
You mustn't cry

431
00:43:59,932 --> 00:44:02,184
Don't worry
I'll be home in no time

432
00:44:03,144 --> 00:44:04,186
Really?

433
00:44:05,021 --> 00:44:07,731
Why, have I ever lied to you?

434
00:44:07,857 --> 00:44:08,982
No

435
00:44:09,484 --> 00:44:10,525
Right?

436
00:44:10,652 --> 00:44:11,485
Yeah

437
00:44:12,070 --> 00:44:12,986
Promise?

438
00:44:13,655 --> 00:44:14,529
Yes

439
00:44:14,947 --> 00:44:16,198
Go along, it's dangerous

440
00:44:16,324 --> 00:44:17,616
OK

441
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:23,747
You promised!

442
00:44:35,009 --> 00:44:37,344
Take care of the Princess!

443
00:45:28,312 --> 00:45:30,981
Aren't we in Pejite yet?

444
00:45:31,107 --> 00:45:33,275
My back is killing me

445
00:45:33,943 --> 00:45:38,613
Boy oh boy, did the Princess
ever pick a bunch of losers

446
00:45:39,782 --> 00:45:41,783
Hey, isn't this strange?

447
00:45:42,869 --> 00:45:45,203
Why do they fly so close together?

448
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:48,790
Like they're afraid of an attack

449
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:07,100
Toxins swirl below the clouds

450
00:46:17,069 --> 00:46:17,986
Don't move

451
00:46:21,532 --> 00:46:22,491
A gun ship!

452
00:46:32,710 --> 00:46:35,504
Enemy fire!
They've hit ship #2!

453
00:46:42,678 --> 00:46:44,054
I told you so

454
00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:46,056
Wow, terrifying!

455
00:46:50,937 --> 00:46:51,895
Defense formation!

456
00:46:52,021 --> 00:46:53,063
That's a Pejite gun ship

457
00:46:53,272 --> 00:46:54,022
Pejite!

458
00:47:06,702 --> 00:47:08,703
Damn! They got #3

459
00:47:08,871 --> 00:47:10,705
What's the Korvet doing?

460
00:47:11,833 --> 00:47:13,208
Their ships just crumble

461
00:47:21,676 --> 00:47:23,885
Oh no, he's hit our tail

462
00:47:29,267 --> 00:47:30,517
The Barge tether snapped

463
00:47:36,607 --> 00:47:37,899
Hurry, Teto

464
00:47:56,752 --> 00:47:58,587
Oh, no, we're going down

465
00:47:59,088 --> 00:47:59,921
Princess!

466
00:48:06,137 --> 00:48:08,221
Stop! No more killing!

467
00:48:17,982 --> 00:48:18,732
No more!

468
00:48:39,170 --> 00:48:40,462
Princess

469
00:48:48,971 --> 00:48:50,138
Hurry, Mito!

470
00:48:50,973 --> 00:48:52,974
Princess, we're doomed

471
00:48:58,814 --> 00:48:59,689
Maybe I can fly it

472
00:48:59,815 --> 00:49:00,857
Are you crazy!

473
00:49:02,902 --> 00:49:03,693
Hurry, Mito!

474
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:05,695
What? Right!

475
00:49:07,073 --> 00:49:09,658
Start the engine!
Blast open the door!

476
00:49:18,167 --> 00:49:19,000
Come!

477
00:49:19,961 --> 00:49:21,169
Hurry

478
00:49:23,631 --> 00:49:25,215
Get inside
Mito, ready?

479
00:49:26,217 --> 00:49:27,217
Ready or not!

480
00:49:29,553 --> 00:49:31,513
Full throttle when we take off!

481
00:49:31,639 --> 00:49:32,222
Roger!

482
00:49:32,682 --> 00:49:33,515
Ready

483
00:49:33,683 --> 00:49:34,557
Go!

484
00:49:45,903 --> 00:49:47,278
Put on the toxin mask

485
00:49:47,405 --> 00:49:49,823
Drop below the clouds
to find the Barge

486
00:50:01,252 --> 00:50:03,044
You're still warm
Don't give up, Teto

487
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:18,476
What is this place!

488
00:50:18,602 --> 00:50:20,854
I've never seen
such dense toxins

489
00:50:21,397 --> 00:50:23,773
Keep an eye on the right tail

490
00:50:23,899 --> 00:50:24,774
It's nearby

491
00:50:25,818 --> 00:50:27,402
It's still aloft

492
00:50:28,738 --> 00:50:30,280
Hey! You're right!

493
00:50:30,656 --> 00:50:31,865
There it is!

494
00:50:45,296 --> 00:50:47,630
It's the Princess!
Princess!

495
00:50:48,049 --> 00:50:49,257
Don't give up, everyone

496
00:50:49,383 --> 00:50:50,383
I'll throw you a rope

497
00:50:51,093 --> 00:50:52,761
Our hook's broken

498
00:50:52,887 --> 00:50:54,888
You can't hook us in mid-air

499
00:50:55,431 --> 00:50:58,266
I don't want to crash and
become insect food!

500
00:50:58,392 --> 00:51:00,393
We'll leap to our deaths!

501
00:51:00,770 --> 00:51:03,897
Don't panic!
Ditch your cargo

502
00:51:04,023 --> 00:51:05,982
Good bye
Farewell!

503
00:51:06,108 --> 00:51:08,902
Listen to me!
Toss your cargo!

504
00:51:09,111 --> 00:51:10,653
Kill the rear engine

505
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:11,654
What?

506
00:51:11,781 --> 00:51:13,531
The engine noise is too loud
Hurry!

507
00:51:13,657 --> 00:51:14,491
Yes!

508
00:51:14,992 --> 00:51:16,034
What?

509
00:51:20,456 --> 00:51:22,957
Princess...
What are you...

510
00:51:25,503 --> 00:51:27,128
Your mask, Princess!

511
00:51:27,254 --> 00:51:28,505
You'll die!

512
00:51:28,631 --> 00:51:30,048
Put your mask on!

513
00:51:30,174 --> 00:51:31,841
I promise you'll be safe

514
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:33,843
Trust me and dump that cargo

515
00:51:33,969 --> 00:51:35,345
We'll do whatever you say

516
00:51:35,471 --> 00:51:38,348
Please! Put your mask back on!

517
00:51:44,313 --> 00:51:46,064
The Princess is smiling

518
00:51:46,190 --> 00:51:47,315
We're going to be OK

519
00:51:47,441 --> 00:51:49,192
Hurry! Lose the cargo

520
00:51:49,485 --> 00:51:50,610
Princess, we're in a nose-dive!

521
00:51:50,736 --> 00:51:53,613
Re-start engines!

522
00:51:53,864 --> 00:51:55,281
I inhaled

523
00:51:58,661 --> 00:52:00,245
Hurry, hurry

524
00:53:14,153 --> 00:53:15,486
Princess!

525
00:53:15,613 --> 00:53:17,113
Everyone safe?

526
00:53:17,656 --> 00:53:18,364
Don't move!

527
00:53:21,869 --> 00:53:23,203
You!

528
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:25,705
Thanks for saving me

529
00:53:26,415 --> 00:53:28,708
Why'd you save her, Princess?

530
00:53:29,251 --> 00:53:30,585
You're a fool

531
00:53:30,711 --> 00:53:33,213
You thought I'd grovel
in gratitude?

532
00:53:34,590 --> 00:53:36,716
You know nothing of the Sea of Decay

533
00:53:38,969 --> 00:53:41,179
It isn't like the human world

534
00:53:41,305 --> 00:53:45,099
There's no knowing what
a single gunshot will bring

535
00:53:46,101 --> 00:53:48,811
That battle hurled
ships into this forest

536
00:53:48,938 --> 00:53:50,480
The insects are furious

537
00:53:50,606 --> 00:53:51,940
Look up

538
00:54:02,785 --> 00:54:04,661
The Yamma are sentries

539
00:54:04,787 --> 00:54:07,247
They'll quickly bring other insects

540
00:54:07,581 --> 00:54:10,166
We must escape now
Throw me your extra rope

541
00:54:10,793 --> 00:54:12,252
Mito, fix the hook

542
00:54:15,256 --> 00:54:17,465
Don't move
I give the orders

543
00:54:17,967 --> 00:54:19,884
What are you so afraid of?

544
00:54:20,010 --> 00:54:21,803
You're just like
a lost fox-squirrel

545
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:23,680
How dare you!

546
00:54:24,181 --> 00:54:25,139
Don't be afraid

547
00:54:25,307 --> 00:54:28,977
We just want you to go back
to your own country

548
00:54:29,270 --> 00:54:30,687
You...

549
00:54:41,907 --> 00:54:42,615
They're here!

550
00:54:56,505 --> 00:54:58,631
Quiet! Don't anger them

551
00:55:00,134 --> 00:55:02,468
This is an Ohm's nest!

552
00:55:02,594 --> 00:55:04,637
We're surrounded

553
00:55:25,909 --> 00:55:27,618
They're examining us

554
00:55:29,496 --> 00:55:31,873
Forgive us, Ohm,

555
00:55:32,082 --> 00:55:34,375
for disturbing your nest

556
00:55:35,210 --> 00:55:38,379
Please understand,
we're not your enemies

557
00:55:59,193 --> 00:56:01,527
Princess!

558
00:57:10,556 --> 00:57:12,140
He's still alive

559
00:57:12,266 --> 00:57:14,016
Wait, Ohm!

560
00:57:28,282 --> 00:57:29,490
What's happening?

561
00:57:29,616 --> 00:57:31,617
Their eyes have turned blood-red

562
00:57:40,335 --> 00:57:43,129
What will you do with the glider?

563
00:57:43,589 --> 00:57:46,632
When the waters quiet,
take off and wait for me above

564
00:57:47,009 --> 00:57:49,552
If I'm not back in 1 hour,
return to the valley

565
00:57:49,678 --> 00:57:51,179
But...

566
00:57:51,346 --> 00:57:53,306
Princess!

567
00:58:08,864 --> 00:58:11,365
She's gone

568
00:58:12,242 --> 00:58:13,659
Hand it over

569
00:58:17,748 --> 00:58:19,373
All right, everyone

570
00:58:19,541 --> 00:58:22,460
We'll do as the Princess said

571
00:58:25,255 --> 00:58:26,923
Princess...

572
00:58:51,114 --> 00:58:52,740
Damn!

573
00:59:28,277 --> 00:59:29,318
Who are you?

574
00:59:29,444 --> 00:59:30,903
You think only of killing

575
00:59:31,196 --> 00:59:33,281
My flares and charms
won't help now

576
01:00:35,010 --> 01:00:36,344
It's quicksand!

577
01:00:41,308 --> 01:00:43,434
Damn!

578
01:01:08,377 --> 01:01:10,086
It's been 2 hours already

579
01:01:10,212 --> 01:01:12,129
More and more insects

580
01:01:12,255 --> 01:01:18,552
Princess!

581
01:01:29,231 --> 01:01:34,068
Nausicaä

582
01:01:36,279 --> 01:01:42,451
Come here

583
01:01:44,204 --> 01:01:45,746
Father

584
01:01:56,133 --> 01:01:57,925
Mother's here, too

585
01:02:06,601 --> 01:02:10,146
No, I don't want to go

586
01:02:12,065 --> 01:02:14,316
Stay away!

587
01:02:17,612 --> 01:02:19,113
There's nothing here

588
01:02:19,239 --> 01:02:21,115
I said, there's nothing!

589
01:02:26,121 --> 01:02:27,788
Stay inside

590
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:30,750
It's a baby Ohm

591
01:02:30,917 --> 01:02:33,669
She's being used by the insects

592
01:02:34,296 --> 01:02:36,672
Give it to me, Nausicaä

593
01:02:36,798 --> 01:02:39,508
No! It's not doing anything bad

594
01:02:39,634 --> 01:02:43,679
Insects and humans can't
live in the same world

595
01:02:54,191 --> 01:02:57,318
Please, don't kill it!

596
01:02:58,987 --> 01:03:00,863
Please!

597
01:03:18,882 --> 01:03:20,341
Teto...

598
01:04:21,736 --> 01:04:23,404
What a strange place

599
01:04:28,076 --> 01:04:28,951
Hey!

600
01:04:29,619 --> 01:04:31,453
I finally found it

601
01:04:31,913 --> 01:04:33,372
How are you feeling?

602
01:04:34,249 --> 01:04:35,916
Where are we?

603
01:04:36,877 --> 01:04:38,627
First, let me thank you

604
01:04:38,753 --> 01:04:40,296
I'm Asbel of Pejite

605
01:04:40,964 --> 01:04:42,590
Thank you for saving me

606
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:46,927
I'm Nausicaä of
the Valley of the Wind

607
01:04:47,804 --> 01:04:49,096
Where are we?

608
01:04:51,266 --> 01:04:53,017
No wonder you're surprised

609
01:04:53,268 --> 01:04:54,894
We're beneath the Sea of Decay

610
01:04:55,353 --> 01:04:56,770
Beneath the Sea of Decay?

611
01:04:56,897 --> 01:04:58,939
Look, we fell from up there,

612
01:04:59,649 --> 01:05:00,941
along with the sand

613
01:05:03,653 --> 01:05:05,446
We're not wearing masks

614
01:05:05,780 --> 01:05:09,283
That's right
The air here is pure

615
01:05:09,451 --> 01:05:10,910
Couldn't believe it myself,

616
01:05:11,411 --> 01:05:14,204
finding this place
under the Sea of Decay

617
01:05:20,670 --> 01:05:22,129
What is it?

618
01:05:33,475 --> 01:05:36,393
Nausicaä, don't wander too far

619
01:05:57,666 --> 01:05:59,667
What a wonderful tree

620
01:06:15,350 --> 01:06:17,851
Even though it's dead,
water still flows through it

621
01:06:52,345 --> 01:06:55,055
Just like the sand
at the bottom of our well

622
01:07:03,023 --> 01:07:07,026
Grains of petrified wood
sifting down from above

623
01:07:25,670 --> 01:07:26,587
Nausicaä

624
01:07:31,968 --> 01:07:33,093
Are you crying?

625
01:07:36,473 --> 01:07:38,932
Yes
I'm so happy

626
01:07:58,369 --> 01:08:01,246
Lastel was my twin sister

627
01:08:01,456 --> 01:08:03,373
I should have been with her

628
01:08:04,292 --> 01:08:06,668
I'm sorry I didn't
tell you sooner

629
01:08:06,795 --> 01:08:07,878
Oh, no...

630
01:08:08,922 --> 01:08:10,339
I'm sorry

631
01:08:10,465 --> 01:08:14,176
I nearly killed the person
who eased my sister's pain

632
01:08:15,970 --> 01:08:19,431
I see...
So it's in the Valley of the Wind

633
01:08:27,023 --> 01:08:28,941
This nut tastes really weird

634
01:08:29,317 --> 01:08:32,361
It's a chiko nut
It's really good for you

635
01:08:44,707 --> 01:08:48,669
It doesn't taste great,
but I could eat a whole boot-full!

636
01:08:59,806 --> 01:09:02,015
Why the Sea of Decay was born...

637
01:09:02,392 --> 01:09:04,852
You think the strangest thoughts

638
01:09:05,562 --> 01:09:09,398
The trees of the Sea of Decay
grew to cleanse

639
01:09:09,524 --> 01:09:12,151
a world polluted by humans

640
01:09:13,194 --> 01:09:15,445
They absorb toxins from the earth,

641
01:09:15,572 --> 01:09:19,366
generate pure crystals,
die and turn to sand

642
01:09:20,243 --> 01:09:23,370
That's what created
these underground caverns

643
01:09:24,914 --> 01:09:27,749
The insects protect this forest

644
01:09:28,251 --> 01:09:31,211
In that case, we're doomed

645
01:09:31,754 --> 01:09:33,589
We can't possibly survive,

646
01:09:33,715 --> 01:09:36,758
living in terror of toxins and insects
for thousands of years

647
01:09:38,344 --> 01:09:42,264
At least we can find a way
to keep it from spreading

648
01:09:42,891 --> 01:09:45,726
You sound just like Kushana

649
01:09:46,102 --> 01:09:49,897
No! We don't plan to use
the Giant Warriors!

650
01:09:50,023 --> 01:09:51,732
You'll see when you
meet my friends tomorrow

651
01:09:52,567 --> 01:09:54,067
Let's go to sleep

652
01:09:54,235 --> 01:09:57,487
We have far to go tomorrow

653
01:10:21,262 --> 01:10:22,596
All's well

654
01:10:25,934 --> 01:10:27,100
On schedule?

655
01:10:27,227 --> 01:10:29,603
The torso is solidifying well

656
01:10:53,127 --> 01:10:57,422
You're one cute monster

657
01:10:57,966 --> 01:10:59,925
Makes a poor soldier think

658
01:11:00,051 --> 01:11:02,928
of dusting off old ambitions

659
01:11:06,766 --> 01:11:08,850
It's grinning

660
01:11:08,977 --> 01:11:12,813
You should've slept beneath
the earth 'til the end of time

661
01:11:13,356 --> 01:11:14,273
Counselor!

662
01:11:15,692 --> 01:11:18,151
Her Highness' planes were
attacked by Pejite survivors

663
01:11:18,278 --> 01:11:20,279
All crashed, except the Korvet

664
01:11:20,697 --> 01:11:22,281
What about Her Highness?

665
01:11:22,782 --> 01:11:25,450
Her ship exploded in flight

666
01:11:27,954 --> 01:11:29,162
Counselor

667
01:11:30,498 --> 01:11:33,500
- The villagers don't know yet?
- No

668
01:11:33,626 --> 01:11:34,835
OK, we'll head out

669
01:11:34,961 --> 01:11:36,962
You stay here and keep working

670
01:11:44,637 --> 01:11:49,099
Either fortune's finally smiling
on this lowly soldier...

671
01:11:49,225 --> 01:11:51,643
Or it's a trap set to destroy me...

672
01:12:00,153 --> 01:12:02,446
Mito and the others have returned,

673
01:12:02,572 --> 01:12:04,531
waiting at Acid Lake, Lord Yupa

674
01:12:25,928 --> 01:12:28,555
In shame we return without her

675
01:12:28,681 --> 01:12:30,932
No, no, I'm pleased you're safe

676
01:12:35,229 --> 01:12:36,897
Releasing me?

677
01:12:37,023 --> 01:12:39,691
Drown the Giant Warrior
deep in Acid Lake,

678
01:12:39,817 --> 01:12:42,569
and return to your country...

679
01:12:42,945 --> 01:12:44,988
Few of your soldiers remain here

680
01:12:45,114 --> 01:12:49,534
We could easily start a fight,
but why sacrifice more people?

681
01:12:49,660 --> 01:12:51,953
Fire and water are powerless against it,

682
01:12:52,246 --> 01:12:55,248
and it's only a matter of time
before it starts to walk

683
01:12:55,458 --> 01:12:58,877
Don't you see?
It's far too late to turn back

684
01:12:59,587 --> 01:13:02,339
My orders to invade Pejite
were motivated by fear

685
01:13:02,465 --> 01:13:04,883
that another country had
harnessed its strength

686
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:07,969
Once its presence here is known,

687
01:13:08,096 --> 01:13:11,348
the great powers will
send their armies

688
01:13:12,934 --> 01:13:15,894
You have but one choice left

689
01:13:16,437 --> 01:13:19,940
Revive the Giant Warrior,
defy both great powers

690
01:13:20,066 --> 01:13:22,484
and learn to live with that thing

691
01:13:22,610 --> 01:13:23,860
Look

692
01:13:28,783 --> 01:13:29,908
An insect did that...?

693
01:13:30,618 --> 01:13:34,329
Whoever becomes my husband
will see worse than that

694
01:13:34,956 --> 01:13:37,082
Burn the Sea of Decay,
kill the insects,

695
01:13:37,208 --> 01:13:39,626
and restore the human world
Why do you hesitate!

696
01:13:41,170 --> 01:13:45,173
Steal it from us, just as
we stole it from Pejite

697
01:13:48,302 --> 01:13:51,138
We shall not give
the Giant Warrior life

698
01:13:53,266 --> 01:13:53,974
Emergency!

699
01:13:54,100 --> 01:13:55,642
What's the password?

700
01:13:55,768 --> 01:13:56,852
I'm in a hurry!

701
01:13:56,978 --> 01:13:57,769
Wind

702
01:13:57,895 --> 01:13:58,895
Valley!

703
01:13:59,021 --> 01:13:59,604
OK

704
01:13:59,730 --> 01:14:01,106
Some spores survived!

705
01:14:01,482 --> 01:14:02,524
What!

706
01:14:02,650 --> 01:14:06,111
They're spreading toxins
and the valley's going crazy!

707
01:14:14,120 --> 01:14:15,579
Hand 'em over

708
01:14:16,998 --> 01:14:17,998
Hurry up!

709
01:14:18,124 --> 01:14:20,208
Hurry, or the valley's doomed

710
01:14:20,334 --> 01:14:23,170
We need our tools back

711
01:14:24,172 --> 01:14:27,132
The tools that burn spores
can also be used as weapons

712
01:14:27,675 --> 01:14:31,136
We have no choice
Release everything but their guns

713
01:14:31,471 --> 01:14:33,096
The Korvet's taking off

714
01:14:33,222 --> 01:14:34,473
Get through this time

715
01:14:34,599 --> 01:14:38,643
Summon all our troops
from Pejite to this valley

716
01:14:39,312 --> 01:14:42,647
Good grief, now
this is a real mess

717
01:14:43,691 --> 01:14:46,151
Hurry

718
01:14:48,529 --> 01:14:50,197
Find the Princess

719
01:14:50,323 --> 01:14:51,448
Look after the valley

720
01:14:51,574 --> 01:14:53,783
Be careful until we return

721
01:14:59,207 --> 01:15:01,082
We're going to the valley

722
01:15:16,057 --> 01:15:18,725
It's no use, the spores
are already here

723
01:15:19,393 --> 01:15:20,727
And on this side, too

724
01:15:22,522 --> 01:15:23,396
Move!

725
01:15:23,564 --> 01:15:25,023
What are you doing!

726
01:15:26,275 --> 01:15:28,235
Oh, no, here, too

727
01:15:29,779 --> 01:15:31,238
Obaba

728
01:15:32,198 --> 01:15:34,074
We've no choice but to burn it

729
01:15:34,283 --> 01:15:36,243
This forest is doomed

730
01:15:36,953 --> 01:15:41,248
If we hesitate, the Sea of Decay
will consume our valley

731
01:15:42,250 --> 01:15:44,543
Isn't there anything to be done?

732
01:15:44,669 --> 01:15:48,004
This forest guarded
the reservoir for 3 centuries

733
01:15:48,130 --> 01:15:51,258
Damn! If only they'd never come

734
01:15:58,933 --> 01:16:01,434
This is getting out of hand

735
01:16:01,561 --> 01:16:03,019
Let's go help them

736
01:16:17,118 --> 01:16:18,451
You think so?

737
01:16:18,578 --> 01:16:21,121
I think it looks the same as ever

738
01:16:22,665 --> 01:16:24,291
The insects have gone

739
01:16:27,878 --> 01:16:31,047
I wonder why my heart's
pounding so hard

740
01:16:31,799 --> 01:16:32,841
We're almost there

741
01:16:33,259 --> 01:16:35,844
My friends are just
over that mountain

742
01:16:56,157 --> 01:16:57,407
Pejite looks strange

743
01:16:57,533 --> 01:16:58,992
What is that haze?

744
01:17:03,873 --> 01:17:05,165
Asbel, your mask

745
01:17:08,294 --> 01:17:10,629
Insects! All dead

746
01:17:11,172 --> 01:17:12,380
Head for Pejite

747
01:17:12,506 --> 01:17:15,675
Be careful, the Tolmekian
army must be there

748
01:18:07,853 --> 01:18:09,270
Even an Ohm...

749
01:18:09,397 --> 01:18:12,065
It attacked the Great Dome

750
01:18:23,035 --> 01:18:24,869
Pejite's finished

751
01:18:24,995 --> 01:18:27,831
They wiped out the Tolmekians,
but this is...

752
01:18:27,957 --> 01:18:31,126
They wiped out?
What do you mean, Asbel?

753
01:18:34,630 --> 01:18:35,588
It's a Brig

754
01:18:35,715 --> 01:18:38,299
My friends' ship!
They're landing, let's go!

755
01:18:50,479 --> 01:18:51,479
Asbel!

756
01:18:51,605 --> 01:18:52,772
You're alive!

757
01:18:53,441 --> 01:18:54,816
What have you done?

758
01:18:54,942 --> 01:18:56,276
We can't rebuild it

759
01:18:56,819 --> 01:18:58,319
You've seen the city

760
01:18:58,446 --> 01:19:01,281
Don't worry, if the Sea of Decay
swallows it, we'll burn it away

761
01:19:01,907 --> 01:19:04,117
But the Giant Warrior isn't here

762
01:19:04,243 --> 01:19:06,453
I know, it's in the Valley of the Wind

763
01:19:06,579 --> 01:19:07,287
How did...

764
01:19:08,956 --> 01:19:10,915
We haven't exactly been idle

765
01:19:11,041 --> 01:19:13,001
We've launched our 2nd phase

766
01:19:13,461 --> 01:19:16,296
We'll wipe out the Tolmekians
in the valley tonight

767
01:19:16,422 --> 01:19:17,505
What!

768
01:19:18,007 --> 01:19:20,341
What are you going to do?

769
01:19:20,468 --> 01:19:22,010
Who's this, Asbel?

770
01:19:23,929 --> 01:19:25,972
Nausicaä from
the Valley of the Wind

771
01:19:26,223 --> 01:19:27,307
I owe her my life

772
01:19:27,892 --> 01:19:29,309
Valley of the Wind...

773
01:19:29,643 --> 01:19:31,311
Tell me, what will happen?

774
01:19:35,191 --> 01:19:38,401
You must know, Asbel!
Tell me

775
01:19:39,945 --> 01:19:41,362
They'll provoke an insect attack

776
01:19:43,282 --> 01:19:45,909
So you made them
attack Pejite, too!

777
01:19:49,747 --> 01:19:51,498
You're... horrible...

778
01:19:54,043 --> 01:19:58,463
We simply have to recover the
Giant Warrior before they revive it

779
01:19:58,589 --> 01:20:00,465
We're doing it to save the world

780
01:20:01,842 --> 01:20:04,469
And so you'll murder
everyone in the Valley!

781
01:20:05,137 --> 01:20:07,680
Stop it! Call it off! Please!

782
01:20:07,848 --> 01:20:09,265
It's too late

783
01:20:09,391 --> 01:20:11,976
Once they've started,
no one can stop them

784
01:20:15,064 --> 01:20:18,691
We've lost most of our
people to the Tolmekians

785
01:20:19,151 --> 01:20:21,152
This is the only way

786
01:20:28,911 --> 01:20:31,162
Let go! Let me fly!

787
01:20:35,709 --> 01:20:39,254
It's horrible now, but the Giant
Warrior will purge the Sea of Decay

788
01:20:39,380 --> 01:20:41,172
and rebuild the human world

789
01:20:41,590 --> 01:20:44,092
Liar! You're just like the Tolmekians

790
01:20:44,218 --> 01:20:46,594
No, they want to use it for destruction

791
01:20:47,513 --> 01:20:50,265
You drink water from the wells, too

792
01:20:50,391 --> 01:20:53,393
Do you know what purifies that water?

793
01:20:53,561 --> 01:20:56,938
The trees in the Sea of Decay
cleanse all the lakes

794
01:20:57,064 --> 01:20:59,399
and rivers that humans polluted!

795
01:21:00,109 --> 01:21:02,110
And you want to destroy that!

796
01:21:02,236 --> 01:21:04,404
Why did you dig up
that Giant Warrior!

797
01:21:05,030 --> 01:21:06,823
What choice do we have?

798
01:21:06,949 --> 01:21:09,033
Subject ourselves to Tolmekian rule?

799
01:21:09,159 --> 01:21:10,410
Never, never!

800
01:21:10,578 --> 01:21:13,746
Tell them, Asbel, how
the Sea of Decay came to be

801
01:21:13,873 --> 01:21:15,623
How the insects protect this world!

802
01:21:17,001 --> 01:21:19,252
Please, Asbel!

803
01:21:20,212 --> 01:21:21,462
What are you doing!

804
01:21:21,589 --> 01:21:24,424
Don't move!
Release her

805
01:21:24,884 --> 01:21:26,676
Calm down, Asbel

806
01:21:27,344 --> 01:21:28,136
I'm serious

807
01:21:28,554 --> 01:21:29,721
Release her

808
01:21:30,598 --> 01:21:32,140
Nausicaä, go and warn them!

809
01:21:37,897 --> 01:21:38,938
Asbel

810
01:21:39,064 --> 01:21:39,772
Let me go!

811
01:22:12,640 --> 01:22:13,848
Fools

812
01:22:18,020 --> 01:22:20,063
No stopping fighting once it starts

813
01:22:20,189 --> 01:22:22,357
But he warned us to be careful...

814
01:22:22,900 --> 01:22:25,944
Quit dawdling and use the tanks
to rescue our men

815
01:22:26,070 --> 01:22:28,363
Counselor! They got the last man!

816
01:22:29,156 --> 01:22:30,031
Coming our way?

817
01:22:30,157 --> 01:22:31,324
I don't know

818
01:22:31,450 --> 01:22:33,409
The whole village is gathering

819
01:22:33,535 --> 01:22:37,330
Why do they go berserk
over a little forest or two?

820
01:22:37,456 --> 01:22:38,873
Just as it was with Pejite

821
01:22:49,426 --> 01:22:51,052
They got our tank!

822
01:22:52,930 --> 01:22:54,055
Hurry, get it moving

823
01:22:54,181 --> 01:22:55,473
Don't panic

824
01:22:56,183 --> 01:22:58,476
Incoming fire!

825
01:22:58,936 --> 01:23:00,478
Forward!

826
01:23:01,981 --> 01:23:03,439
Hurry up!

827
01:23:03,565 --> 01:23:05,358
Maybe this is it?

828
01:23:06,860 --> 01:23:08,486
It's moving!

829
01:23:08,612 --> 01:23:10,530
Which way?

830
01:23:16,662 --> 01:23:18,371
Forward, move forward

831
01:23:18,497 --> 01:23:19,998
I know that

832
01:23:30,342 --> 01:23:32,677
Damn! Mobilize all the tanks

833
01:23:36,557 --> 01:23:38,474
She survived...

834
01:23:38,600 --> 01:23:40,685
So much for my dreams...

835
01:23:41,562 --> 01:23:42,395
Your Highness!

836
01:23:47,317 --> 01:23:48,776
We'll hold 'em off here

837
01:23:48,902 --> 01:23:51,654
Lead everyone to safety
by Acid Lake

838
01:23:51,780 --> 01:23:53,281
All right

839
01:23:54,908 --> 01:23:58,369
It's just until the Princess
returns with the gun ship

840
01:24:01,957 --> 01:24:04,584
Hurry everyone!

841
01:24:05,294 --> 01:24:06,961
Stop gawking and help me

842
01:24:07,087 --> 01:24:08,421
My aching back

843
01:24:10,507 --> 01:24:12,425
The tanks are coming!

844
01:24:15,763 --> 01:24:16,763
Hurry!

845
01:24:16,930 --> 01:24:18,639
I know that

846
01:24:34,782 --> 01:24:35,740
Are you sure?

847
01:24:35,866 --> 01:24:36,741
It's a Pejite Brig

848
01:24:37,284 --> 01:24:38,826
I saw it peeking through the clouds

849
01:24:38,952 --> 01:24:39,619
OK!

850
01:24:53,926 --> 01:24:56,594
Watch out, she's a wild one

851
01:25:03,894 --> 01:25:05,019
Quickly

852
01:25:07,147 --> 01:25:09,982
Nausicaä, you may go free

853
01:25:10,192 --> 01:25:11,192
Go warn your Valley

854
01:25:11,860 --> 01:25:14,195
Your glider may get you
there in time

855
01:25:14,988 --> 01:25:16,364
It's waiting

856
01:25:17,783 --> 01:25:20,118
Asbel told me everything

857
01:25:20,244 --> 01:25:22,745
I'll take your place
Put this on

858
01:25:22,871 --> 01:25:23,704
You're...

859
01:25:24,790 --> 01:25:26,207
Lastel's mother

860
01:25:28,961 --> 01:25:30,002
Thank you

861
01:25:31,338 --> 01:25:33,297
I'm so very sorry

862
01:25:33,715 --> 01:25:36,092
Everything we've done is wrong

863
01:25:36,218 --> 01:25:37,009
Hurry!

864
01:25:44,852 --> 01:25:45,643
What about her?

865
01:25:45,769 --> 01:25:47,687
She'll be all right, don't worry

866
01:25:53,777 --> 01:25:54,944
Be careful

867
01:25:55,070 --> 01:25:57,488
We've treated you so badly

868
01:25:57,614 --> 01:25:59,073
Over here, Nausicaä

869
01:26:00,200 --> 01:26:01,450
Hurry

870
01:26:02,744 --> 01:26:04,704
Thank you, everyone!

871
01:26:07,040 --> 01:26:09,000
Sorry it took so long

872
01:26:11,128 --> 01:26:12,378
Can you launch from here?

873
01:26:12,504 --> 01:26:13,671
I'll try

874
01:26:21,763 --> 01:26:22,597
A Korvet!

875
01:26:26,018 --> 01:26:28,603
Take cover in the clouds!

876
01:26:33,233 --> 01:26:34,859
Stop firing!

877
01:26:40,032 --> 01:26:43,075
Idiots! Nothing but wind
and lightning in there

878
01:26:48,457 --> 01:26:51,083
It's useless! I've lost control!

879
01:26:59,885 --> 01:27:01,093
The ship is breaking apart

880
01:27:01,762 --> 01:27:04,597
We have to leave
the clouds and fight

881
01:27:10,896 --> 01:27:12,230
They were expecting us

882
01:27:21,198 --> 01:27:22,448
What are they up to?

883
01:27:22,574 --> 01:27:24,575
Forcing us into the clouds
so they can board us

884
01:27:41,677 --> 01:27:44,220
Here they come
This is your last chance

885
01:27:44,346 --> 01:27:45,805
No, I'll stay with you

886
01:27:46,348 --> 01:27:47,765
I can't abandon all those people

887
01:27:47,891 --> 01:27:49,642
and the girl who took my place

888
01:27:50,602 --> 01:27:52,144
Only you can save your people

889
01:27:52,771 --> 01:27:55,773
Please, go, for our sakes!

890
01:28:07,119 --> 01:28:08,202
The ship is ours

891
01:28:08,328 --> 01:28:10,663
Take no prisoners
Destroy them

892
01:28:15,669 --> 01:28:17,211
Go, Nausicaä!

893
01:28:18,380 --> 01:28:19,797
Asbel!

894
01:29:17,481 --> 01:29:19,690
Princess!

895
01:29:20,525 --> 01:29:21,192
Mito!

896
01:29:36,500 --> 01:29:38,167
Mito! Lord Yupa!

897
01:29:38,502 --> 01:29:39,543
Princess

898
01:29:39,920 --> 01:29:42,546
Hurry, everyone's in...!

899
01:29:42,964 --> 01:29:45,257
I'll engage the hook now

900
01:29:45,384 --> 01:29:47,551
Lord Yupa, that red lever!

901
01:29:53,767 --> 01:29:56,185
This is their last stronghold

902
01:30:01,400 --> 01:30:03,567
The door won't hold

903
01:30:03,944 --> 01:30:07,780
Any time
Show them some Pejite pride

904
01:30:09,950 --> 01:30:10,783
What is that?

905
01:30:11,827 --> 01:30:12,827
A bird?

906
01:30:13,495 --> 01:30:15,621
A ship, a gun ship from the Valley

907
01:30:15,747 --> 01:30:16,330
What!

908
01:30:25,507 --> 01:30:27,091
You...

909
01:30:34,683 --> 01:30:37,476
It's Lord Yupa, here's
a chance for glory!

910
01:30:45,527 --> 01:30:48,571
Surrender, your Korvet
won't be back

911
01:30:48,697 --> 01:30:49,822
This guy's tough

912
01:30:54,661 --> 01:30:57,830
Princess, you're crazy
The engine'll blow

913
01:30:58,331 --> 01:31:00,833
Just make it to the Valley
Speed up!

914
01:31:03,545 --> 01:31:05,838
Dear God, God of the Wind

915
01:31:06,006 --> 01:31:07,840
Please protect my people

916
01:31:27,402 --> 01:31:30,112
They won't budge

917
01:31:30,238 --> 01:31:31,947
They're waiting for her return

918
01:31:32,073 --> 01:31:32,865
Return?

919
01:31:33,366 --> 01:31:36,577
They believe that girl will
return with their gun ship

920
01:31:36,703 --> 01:31:40,372
That gun ship's a pain
It's our chance to attack

921
01:31:40,999 --> 01:31:43,584
Do you know what that ship is?

922
01:31:43,710 --> 01:31:46,504
It's from before
the Seven Days of Fire

923
01:31:46,630 --> 01:31:49,882
The one they say
went as far as the stars...

924
01:31:50,550 --> 01:31:52,760
It's too strong for our guns,

925
01:31:52,886 --> 01:31:54,762
but bury it in a hole...

926
01:31:54,888 --> 01:31:56,889
I, too, wish to wait

927
01:31:57,849 --> 01:32:01,101
If she really does return from
deep in the Sea of Decay...

928
01:32:02,562 --> 01:32:05,606
I'd like a chance
to really talk to her

929
01:32:09,277 --> 01:32:11,737
Made up your minds?

930
01:32:12,072 --> 01:32:14,865
If you'll aid our attack,
I'll let you go

931
01:32:16,076 --> 01:32:17,701
You want to end up like Pejite?

932
01:32:19,120 --> 01:32:21,580
You're a Princess, too

933
01:32:21,706 --> 01:32:24,708
You're nothing like our Princess

934
01:32:24,834 --> 01:32:26,418
Look at my hand

935
01:32:27,254 --> 01:32:29,421
That's what King Jihl had

936
01:32:29,714 --> 01:32:33,425
In 6 more months
it will be stone

937
01:32:33,593 --> 01:32:35,886
But our Princess said,

938
01:32:36,012 --> 01:32:39,056
she liked these hands

939
01:32:39,766 --> 01:32:43,435
They were the beautiful hands
of a hard worker

940
01:32:43,979 --> 01:32:46,063
You want to live
with the Sea of Decay

941
01:32:46,189 --> 01:32:48,440
even as its toxins ravage you?

942
01:32:49,568 --> 01:32:54,154
You use fire
We use it a bit, too

943
01:32:54,281 --> 01:32:57,366
Too much fire
and nothing will grow

944
01:32:57,617 --> 01:33:00,619
Fire can turn the forest
into ashes in a single day

945
01:33:00,912 --> 01:33:04,540
Water and wind sustain
a forest for 1 00 years

946
01:33:04,666 --> 01:33:07,418
We like the water and the wind

947
01:33:07,544 --> 01:33:11,505
The sight of our forest
will grieve the Princess

948
01:33:13,300 --> 01:33:15,801
Counselor, we await your orders

949
01:33:15,927 --> 01:33:16,802
Shut up

950
01:33:16,928 --> 01:33:17,928
Yes sir

951
01:33:22,142 --> 01:33:25,436
Who knows what happened,
but she sure looks cute

952
01:33:25,979 --> 01:33:28,439
Let them go, Kurotowa!

953
01:33:28,815 --> 01:33:30,941
Huh? You want to wait?

954
01:33:31,318 --> 01:33:32,860
Feed the soldiers

955
01:33:32,986 --> 01:33:35,321
We attack in 1 hour

956
01:33:37,657 --> 01:33:41,452
Food, huh?
Finally, a real meal

957
01:33:41,661 --> 01:33:43,454
Someone's coming!

958
01:33:45,332 --> 01:33:46,457
It's Gol and the others

959
01:33:50,629 --> 01:33:51,920
What is it?

960
01:33:52,714 --> 01:33:53,839
There's no wind

961
01:33:54,174 --> 01:33:55,507
No wind?

962
01:33:57,510 --> 01:33:59,845
You're right, the wind's stopped

963
01:34:01,222 --> 01:34:02,514
Obaba, what is it?

964
01:34:02,641 --> 01:34:03,849
Obaba

965
01:34:04,059 --> 01:34:08,854
Someone...
Someone take me outside...

966
01:34:15,737 --> 01:34:17,363
The wind's never stopped before

967
01:34:32,379 --> 01:34:34,713
Obaba, my ears hurt

968
01:34:35,048 --> 01:34:39,343
The air...
The very air is thick with rage

969
01:34:54,776 --> 01:34:55,776
We're close!

970
01:34:56,069 --> 01:34:59,029
We're clear of the Sea of Decay!
3 minutes to Acid Lake!

971
01:34:59,406 --> 01:35:02,032
Idle the engines
Drop beneath the clouds

972
01:35:11,126 --> 01:35:13,043
What's this glow!

973
01:35:15,004 --> 01:35:16,046
Ohms!

974
01:35:34,107 --> 01:35:37,568
The Sea of Decay is spreading
They're headed for the Valley

975
01:35:38,153 --> 01:35:40,696
How did they stampede the Ohms...

976
01:35:46,619 --> 01:35:48,579
Someone's baiting them

977
01:35:49,164 --> 01:35:51,415
Mito! Turn towards Sirius

978
01:35:51,541 --> 01:35:53,333
Yes!

979
01:36:20,361 --> 01:36:21,361
It's there

980
01:36:21,488 --> 01:36:22,946
Mito, a flare!

981
01:36:23,865 --> 01:36:24,907
Ready

982
01:36:26,326 --> 01:36:27,326
Fire!

983
01:36:32,916 --> 01:36:33,957
What is that?

984
01:36:46,054 --> 01:36:47,679
How cruel...

985
01:36:47,806 --> 01:36:50,557
They're baiting them
with a baby

986
01:36:50,683 --> 01:36:52,351
I'll shoot 'em down!

987
01:36:52,727 --> 01:36:53,894
No, Mito!

988
01:36:55,605 --> 01:36:58,065
Don't shoot!

989
01:37:02,821 --> 01:37:04,696
Why not! Why shouldn't I?

990
01:37:04,864 --> 01:37:07,407
Kill the baby,
and the stampede will never end!

991
01:37:07,826 --> 01:37:11,036
What can we do!
They'll destroy the Valley

992
01:37:11,496 --> 01:37:12,538
Calm down, Mito

993
01:37:12,705 --> 01:37:15,374
Return the baby to them
Let's try

994
01:37:23,341 --> 01:37:24,716
What are you doing, Princess!

995
01:37:25,093 --> 01:37:26,927
You go ahead and warn them

996
01:37:28,096 --> 01:37:29,221
Princess!

997
01:37:29,389 --> 01:37:30,889
You're not even armed

998
01:37:43,236 --> 01:37:44,903
That's not one of our flares

999
01:37:45,029 --> 01:37:45,612
How far?

1000
01:37:45,738 --> 01:37:48,407
20 leagues
The other side of the lake

1001
01:37:49,033 --> 01:37:50,409
Is it a gun ship?

1002
01:37:50,577 --> 01:37:51,869
Probably

1003
01:37:59,586 --> 01:38:01,295
That's a distress signal

1004
01:38:01,421 --> 01:38:03,171
It's definitely the gun ship

1005
01:38:03,631 --> 01:38:05,591
It's been an hour, let's go

1006
01:38:05,717 --> 01:38:06,884
Why not wait?

1007
01:38:07,010 --> 01:38:09,052
The bloodshed is inevitable

1008
01:38:15,894 --> 01:38:18,020
Infantry advance

1009
01:38:22,901 --> 01:38:24,151
Your Highness, get inside

1010
01:38:24,277 --> 01:38:25,444
I'm fine here

1011
01:38:32,243 --> 01:38:34,453
The gun ship!

1012
01:38:37,123 --> 01:38:38,624
Fire!

1013
01:38:48,134 --> 01:38:49,134
Hold your fire!

1014
01:38:49,260 --> 01:38:51,261
Stop it! Stop!

1015
01:38:55,224 --> 01:38:56,141
Princess!

1016
01:38:56,601 --> 01:38:59,311
Stand-by
Don't fire

1017
01:38:59,938 --> 01:39:01,146
Your Highness

1018
01:39:04,984 --> 01:39:05,901
Where's the girl!

1019
01:39:06,027 --> 01:39:07,069
The Princess!

1020
01:39:07,195 --> 01:39:08,779
She's not here

1021
01:39:08,905 --> 01:39:11,198
The Ohm, a stampede
It's coming this way

1022
01:39:11,324 --> 01:39:12,366
What!

1023
01:39:12,492 --> 01:39:13,200
The Ohm!

1024
01:39:13,785 --> 01:39:16,828
The Princess stayed behind
to stop them

1025
01:39:17,288 --> 01:39:19,331
This is no time for battle

1026
01:39:19,916 --> 01:39:23,168
Everyone run, find the
highest place you can! Now!

1027
01:39:26,172 --> 01:39:29,216
Obaba, I see a red glow

1028
01:39:32,178 --> 01:39:33,720
It's spreading

1029
01:39:33,846 --> 01:39:35,305
It's coming this way

1030
01:39:35,431 --> 01:39:38,892
You hold on tight

1031
01:39:39,018 --> 01:39:42,813
There's no stopping them now

1032
01:39:43,606 --> 01:39:45,065
Don't panic

1033
01:39:46,484 --> 01:39:48,193
There's still time

1034
01:39:48,987 --> 01:39:52,864
If I have to die,
I want to die in the Valley

1035
01:39:52,991 --> 01:39:56,702
No, you mustn't give up,
not while the Princess has faith

1036
01:39:57,286 --> 01:39:59,705
Listen, hold them off
as long as you can

1037
01:39:59,831 --> 01:40:01,206
I'll return soon

1038
01:40:01,582 --> 01:40:03,417
Your Highness, not that...

1039
01:40:03,543 --> 01:40:04,418
It's not ready yet!

1040
01:40:05,253 --> 01:40:07,421
If not now, when!

1041
01:40:07,547 --> 01:40:08,839
Go!

1042
01:40:13,803 --> 01:40:16,221
Don't shoot! Listen to me!

1043
01:40:30,153 --> 01:40:32,070
Damn! She flies like a bird

1044
01:40:32,280 --> 01:40:35,323
She's not an enemy
She wants to say something

1045
01:40:35,450 --> 01:40:37,909
Anyone who interferes is an enemy

1046
01:40:38,244 --> 01:40:41,913
We'd better drop the bait in
the Valley soon, or die ourselves

1047
01:40:45,376 --> 01:40:47,919
Here she comes!
Let her come in close, then fire

1048
01:41:01,225 --> 01:41:02,350
Now! Fire!

1049
01:41:02,477 --> 01:41:03,268
No!

1050
01:41:04,103 --> 01:41:05,062
That's Lastel!

1051
01:41:05,188 --> 01:41:05,771
Move!

1052
01:41:53,402 --> 01:41:54,736
Ohm...

1053
01:42:21,931 --> 01:42:24,558
Don't be angry
Don't be frightened

1054
01:42:24,684 --> 01:42:26,184
I'm not your foe

1055
01:42:28,729 --> 01:42:30,063
I'm sorry

1056
01:42:30,523 --> 01:42:33,775
I'm sorry
I can't ask your forgiveness

1057
01:42:34,777 --> 01:42:36,528
It's too cruel

1058
01:42:46,706 --> 01:42:49,374
Don't move!
You'll bleed to death

1059
01:42:50,168 --> 01:42:52,210
Be good, little one, keep still

1060
01:43:02,013 --> 01:43:03,346
They've found us

1061
01:43:03,472 --> 01:43:04,931
They're coming

1062
01:43:06,851 --> 01:43:09,227
Stop! Not with those wounds!

1063
01:43:09,478 --> 01:43:11,563
The lake is poison...

1064
01:43:46,557 --> 01:43:47,933
You...

1065
01:44:15,836 --> 01:44:17,379
Good baby

1066
01:44:17,505 --> 01:44:21,675
I'm fine
They're coming for you

1067
01:44:28,140 --> 01:44:30,183
They're turning away

1068
01:44:31,727 --> 01:44:35,188
Ohm! Don't!
The Valley's that way

1069
01:44:38,818 --> 01:44:41,152
They've forgotten us in their rage

1070
01:44:41,320 --> 01:44:43,154
If I don't calm them, the Valley...

1071
01:44:57,128 --> 01:44:59,963
Fools! Drawing them
with their own fire

1072
01:45:00,089 --> 01:45:01,089
We're safe

1073
01:45:01,215 --> 01:45:03,675
We'd better get away
Check the engine

1074
01:45:04,802 --> 01:45:06,386
No, no!

1075
01:45:07,805 --> 01:45:09,639
We can discuss this

1076
01:45:09,765 --> 01:45:11,516
Take us to them

1077
01:45:11,642 --> 01:45:13,393
I must give them the baby

1078
01:45:13,978 --> 01:45:15,937
What's the point, it's too late

1079
01:45:16,063 --> 01:45:17,856
They'll never stop

1080
01:45:20,526 --> 01:45:23,403
Drop us in front of them, then

1081
01:45:23,529 --> 01:45:24,404
Take us

1082
01:45:25,197 --> 01:45:26,906
But you'll die, too

1083
01:45:35,875 --> 01:45:38,126
Obaba, will we all die?

1084
01:45:39,003 --> 01:45:42,422
If that's our fate,
we must accept it

1085
01:45:42,757 --> 01:45:44,382
They don't even waver

1086
01:45:44,550 --> 01:45:45,091
Let's retreat

1087
01:45:45,217 --> 01:45:48,428
Idiot! There's nowhere to go

1088
01:45:53,017 --> 01:45:55,060
Don't retreat!

1089
01:45:56,062 --> 01:45:57,562
Hold your ground
for Her Highness

1090
01:45:58,064 --> 01:45:58,938
Highness...

1091
01:45:59,065 --> 01:46:00,398
Your Highness!

1092
01:46:30,513 --> 01:46:32,931
Get them!

1093
01:46:33,057 --> 01:46:34,974
The Giant Warrior...
Giant Warrior

1094
01:46:47,405 --> 01:46:49,906
It's rotting
It's too soon

1095
01:46:57,790 --> 01:46:59,249
Burn them!

1096
01:46:59,917 --> 01:47:01,126
What's wrong

1097
01:47:01,252 --> 01:47:04,796
Are you not descended from
Earth's most evil tribe!

1098
01:47:20,896 --> 01:47:24,566
Incredible...
No wonder the world caught fire

1099
01:47:24,692 --> 01:47:27,152
Your Highness Kushana, hurray!

1100
01:47:38,831 --> 01:47:40,331
Destroy them!

1101
01:47:40,791 --> 01:47:43,501
What's wrong with you?
Hurry up and fire!

1102
01:48:16,660 --> 01:48:18,369
We're done for

1103
01:48:22,082 --> 01:48:23,958
The Giant Warrior is dead

1104
01:48:24,084 --> 01:48:26,252
It's for the best

1105
01:48:26,378 --> 01:48:29,380
The Ohm's rage is
the fury of the Earth itself

1106
01:48:30,382 --> 01:48:34,385
There's no reason to live
if our lives depend on a monster

1107
01:48:38,224 --> 01:48:39,015
Princess!

1108
01:48:39,141 --> 01:48:40,558
The Princess!

1109
01:48:50,569 --> 01:48:52,237
Not there

1110
01:48:52,363 --> 01:48:52,987
It's madness

1111
01:48:53,113 --> 01:48:53,863
Princess!

1112
01:50:05,185 --> 01:50:08,021
The Ohms are changing color

1113
01:50:30,044 --> 01:50:32,337
Their rage has vanished

1114
01:50:33,839 --> 01:50:36,341
They stopped
The Ohms stopped

1115
01:50:54,151 --> 01:50:55,610
Princess!

1116
01:51:03,369 --> 01:51:06,120
The Princess is dead

1117
01:51:06,914 --> 01:51:11,417
She calmed them
with her own life

1118
01:51:11,543 --> 01:51:14,754
She saved our Valley

1119
01:52:14,773 --> 01:52:15,857
Look...

1120
01:52:21,447 --> 01:52:23,531
What is that light?

1121
01:52:50,350 --> 01:52:51,392
Teto...

1122
01:53:07,493 --> 01:53:08,701
Wonderful

1123
01:53:09,536 --> 01:53:11,579
Thank you, Ohm

1124
01:53:12,164 --> 01:53:13,623
Thank you

1125
01:53:32,601 --> 01:53:34,644
It's a miracle
A miracle

1126
01:53:35,813 --> 01:53:39,899
Such friendship and sympathy

1127
01:53:40,025 --> 01:53:43,236
The Ohms have opened their hearts

1128
01:53:43,654 --> 01:53:47,365
Children, watch well and tell me

1129
01:53:47,533 --> 01:53:49,283
what I cannot see

1130
01:53:49,409 --> 01:53:52,662
The Princess is wearing
strange blue clothes

1131
01:53:54,081 --> 01:53:57,250
It's like she's walking
through golden fields

1132
01:54:06,343 --> 01:54:09,554
"...clothed in blue robes,

1133
01:54:09,680 --> 01:54:13,140
"descending onto a golden field..."

1134
01:54:15,060 --> 01:54:16,686
Obaba...

1135
01:54:16,812 --> 01:54:20,398
The ancient legend was true

1136
01:54:21,441 --> 01:54:22,984
Look!

1137
01:54:24,152 --> 01:54:25,486
The glider

1138
01:54:25,737 --> 01:54:28,281
The wind!
The wind has returned
