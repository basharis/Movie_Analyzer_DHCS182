1
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,160
Yes, Salvatore.
Salvatore Di Vita.

2
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:19,560
What do you mean
you don't know him?

3
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:23,240
Yes, that's right.
This is his mother.

4
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,680
I'm calling from Sicily.
I've been trying all day.

5
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,000
I see. He's not there.

6
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,600
Then can you tell me, please--

7
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,520
656-220-56.

8
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,280
Thank you. Good-bye.

9
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,120
Mama, it's no use calling.

10
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,000
He's a busy man.
He could be anywhere.

11
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,200
He won't remember anymore.

12
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,440
Come on, let it go.

13
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,280
He hasn't been here in 30 years.

14
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,000
You know how he is.

15
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,160
He'll remember.

16
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,320
I'm sure he'll remember.
I know him better than you.

17
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:22,000
If he finds out later
we didn't tell him, he'll be upset.

18
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,760
I'd like to talk
to Mr. Salvatore Di Vita.

19
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,160
This is his mother.

20
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,880
What the hell are you looking at?

21
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,320
Salvatore...

22
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,400
what time is it?

23
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,760
It's very late.

24
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,920
I'm sorry. There was no way
to let you know.

25
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,400
Go back to sleep.

26
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,240
Your mother called.

27
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,280
She took me for someone else.

28
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,280
What did you tell her?

29
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,360
I played along.
I didn't want to disappoint her.

30
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,280
We had a long talk.

31
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,680
She said you haven't visited her
in 30 years.

32
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,800
When she wants to see you,
she comes to Rome.

33
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,440
She called just to say that?

34
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,400
No.

35
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:50,560
She said someone died--
someone named Alfredo.

36
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,720
The funeral is tomorrow.

37
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,400
Who is he, a relative?

38
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,480
No. Go to sleep.

39
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,880
This boy will be
the death of me.

40
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,880
Toto!

41
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,760
Better late than never.

42
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:50,200
How often must I say it?
Without the bell, I lose my place.

43
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:54,360
You're always sleeping.
What do you do at night, eat?

44
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:58,640
Father, at my house
we don't even eat at noon.

45
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,880
The veterinarian says so.
That's why I'm tired.

46
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,760
I know why you're tired.
Don't think I don't.

47
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,000
Now run along home.
I've something to do.

48
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,000
- Can I come?
- No, you cannot.

49
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,840
- Yes, yes!
- Toto, out!

50
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,000
I want to! I want to!

51
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,080
Alfredo.

52
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,280
You can start.

53
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,400
Here we go again.

54
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,480
Fix the picture!

55
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:42,760
<i>Pepe, one day we'll have it all.</i>

56
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:46,240
<i>We'll go away together...</i>

57
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,240
<i>live the easy life...</i>

58
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,680
<i>where no one knows us.</i>

59
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,840
<i>Forget it.</i>

60
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,640
<i>You don't love me anymore.</i>

61
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,920
<i>It would be nice...</i>

62
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,360
<i>if you could spare
a few kind words.</i>

63
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,480
<i>I can't.</i>

64
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,680
<i>Oh, well. Thanks anyway.</i>

65
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,520
One pair, two pair!

66
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:06,360
One hundred lire! Real nylon!

67
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,640
You mustn't come here.

68
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,800
Can't you get it through
your thick skull?

69
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,000
If the film catches fire...

70
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:33,120
little as you are,
you'll go up-- voom!

71
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,080
""And turn into a lump of coal.''

72
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,480
Like to wag your tongue, eh?

73
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,560
One day I'll cut it off.

74
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,880
Like that.

75
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,920
Can I have it?

76
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:05,240
Come on, can I have it?

77
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,360
Well, can I?

78
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,040
What, are you deaf?

79
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:17,040
I have to splice it back in
before I return the film.

80
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,560
You're such a pest!

81
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,000
Why didn't you splice these in
when you gave the films back?

82
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:31,160
Sometimes I can't find
the right place, so they stay here.

83
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,600
Anyway, they kiss too much.

84
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:37,080
Then I can have them.

85
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,440
No. Now look, come here.

86
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:44,360
Before I kick your behind,
let's make a deal.

87
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,240
All those are yours--
a present.

88
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,720
Thanks.

89
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,880
But one, you keep out of here,
and two, they stay with me. Got it?

90
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,160
All right.

91
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,760
Right. Then we agree.
Now scram.

92
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,720
What kind of a deal is that?

93
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,040
If they're mine,
how come you keep them?

94
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,560
Don't come back,
or I'll split your head open!

95
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,040
""Shoot first, think later.''

96
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:36,120
""This is no job for cowards,
you backstabbing dog!''

97
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:44,640
""Hey, you! Hands off the gold,
you rotten bastard!''

98
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,720
""You dirty swine,
stay away from me...

99
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,120
or I'll smash your face in.''

100
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:16,680
Mama, if the war's over,
why doesn't Papa come back?

101
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:21,040
He'll come back, you'll see.
One of these days.

102
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,920
I don't remember him.

103
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,440
Where's Russia?

104
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,640
It takes years to get there...

105
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,880
and years to come back.

106
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,040
Go to bed. It's late.

107
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:13,600
You can fool your mother,
but not me!

108
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:19,240
Get your diploma
and join the police! Lazybones!

109
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,000
Good-for-nothing!

110
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,200
Get a move on!

111
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,360
Well?
What is 5 times 5?

112
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,520
Thirty.

113
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,560
Silence!

114
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,000
The fives times table, dimwit.

115
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,960
One times 5 is 5...

116
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,760
2 times 5 is 1 0...

117
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,240
3 times 5 is 1 5...

118
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,120
4 times 5 is 20.

119
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,360
5 times 5?

120
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,880
Forty.

121
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,360
Silence!

122
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,200
Boccia...

123
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,240
twenty-five.

124
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:36,800
Learn your times tables,
or you'll never get a job.

125
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,120
For the last time...

126
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,880
what is 5 times 5?

127
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:42,920
Christmas!

128
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,040
I paid to get in.
I'm seeing the movie.

129
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,960
Get down from there, you rascal.

130
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,840
Go back to your seat.

131
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:34,080
Worse than rabbits.
They're all over the place.

132
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,040
Little monsters.

133
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,360
<i>I'm off to Oregon.</i>

134
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,400
<i>Wait for me at my ranch.</i>

135
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,600
<i>Wait for a dead man?</i>

136
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:54,200
<i>A star-studded cast...</i>

137
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,800
<i>featuring John Wayne...</i>

138
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,040
<i>Claire Trevor--</i>

139
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,280
Hello, everyone!

140
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:15,040
- Can't I say hello?
- It's a double feature today.

141
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,040
So? I'm here to sleep.

142
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,920
- Got some smokes?
- American.

143
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,160
Cut the news, Alfredo!

144
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,720
Shut up!
This stuff is important!

145
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,520
<i>The men and women
who fought in secret...</i>

146
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,560
<i>our brave partisans,
are reunited in Rome...</i>

147
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,720
<i>for the first Resistance Rally...</i>

148
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,920
<i>organized by the CVL.</i>

149
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:49,520
<i>Parri is the acting president.
Sandro Pertini--</i>

150
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,800
Good evening, everyone!

151
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,720
Will you show the movie already?

152
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,600
Sit down and be quiet!

153
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:39,080
- What does it say?
- I'm illiterate.

154
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,320
You too?

155
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:52,160
<i>Twelve hours ofblood and sweat...</i>

156
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:57,000
<i>and what they bring home
barely keeps them from starving.</i>

157
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,160
<i>Yet when they pulled in
their nets...</i>

158
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,720
<i>they were full.</i>

159
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,560
<i>They wanted 750 lire.</i>

160
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,080
<i>It's always the same.</i>

161
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,440
<i>But they don't pay us enough.</i>

162
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,440
<i>That's how it's always been.</i>

163
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,600
<i>And it's never going to change.</i>

164
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,320
I knew it!

165
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:50,240
In 20 years I've never seen
a kiss on the screen!

166
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:54,200
As if they'd let us!

167
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,960
Kiss my ass!

168
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:57,800
- Don Vincenzo.
- You and you, to work.

169
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,800
What about me?

170
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,520
Go ask Stalin for a job.

171
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:05,840
His day will come.
You watch.

172
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,640
I always get left out.

173
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,920
Good movie.
The kid really acted well.

174
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,760
Too bad he was so unlucky.

175
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:17,760
What a jackass to buy that boat.

176
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:21,320
Idiot, you didn't get it at all.

177
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:27,320
Right, boys,
you work from dawn to dusk.

178
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,200
And don't ask how much it pays.

179
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,960
I've been looking for you all day.
Did you get the milk?

180
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,840
Where's the money?

181
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,520
It got stolen.

182
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:10,120
You spent it at the movies?

183
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:15,240
Movies, always movies!

184
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,960
Signora Maria, stop.

185
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,480
Leave him alone. Take it easy.

186
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:26,760
And you,
why do you tell lies?

187
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,600
You know you got in for free.

188
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:31,520
Tell your mother.

189
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,840
Maybe he lost the money inside.

190
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,200
- How much did you have?
- Fifty lire.

191
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:42,160
What did you find
under the seats tonight?

192
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,240
A comb.

193
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,560
Two shoe lifts.

194
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:58,200
- A can of tobacco--
- And...

195
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,960
fifty lire.

196
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,880
See?

197
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,040
Thank you, Alfredo.

198
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,640
I knew where you were going.

199
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:29,480
The square is mine!
It's mine!

200
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,560
It's midnight. Midnight!

201
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:38,360
Out! Shoo!
I have to close the square.

202
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,280
Hard on the feet, eh, Father?

203
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,600
On the way there, it's all downhill
and all the saints help out.

204
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,920
But coming back,
the saints just watch.

205
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,920
If that's God's will.

206
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,080
See you tonight.

207
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,840
What's wrong?

208
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,440
Your foot this time.

209
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,880
It's always something with you.
What can I do?

210
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:39,560
Alfredo,
did you know my father?

211
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:42,360
What a question.
Of course I knew him.

212
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:46,920
Tall, thin, friendly guy
with a big moustache like mine.

213
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:50,520
Always smiling.
He looked a lot like Clark Gable.

214
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,320
Now that I'll be
in fifth grade...

215
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,400
I don't say I should
come in the booth...

216
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:01,600
but can't we at least be friends?

217
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:06,440
""I choose my friends for looks,
my enemies for intelligence.''

218
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:09,640
You're too sly to be my friend.

219
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,400
I always tell my children...

220
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:15,640
""Be careful
how you choose your friends.''

221
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:18,200
You haven't got any children.

222
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,360
When I do, I'll tell them.

223
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:31,120
Don't cry, don't cry.
It's all right.

224
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:34,880
The fire's out.
It's over. Mama's here.

225
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,640
What happened?

226
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,640
Monster!

227
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:42,440
Your little sister
could have burned to death!

228
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,800
It's all your fault!

229
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:52,760
I told you not to keep your film
under the bed by the fire pan.

230
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:55,720
Even the photographs burned!

231
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,840
He could have set
the house on fire!

232
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,840
You and your stupid movies!

233
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:16,840
Aren't you ashamed to play
with a little boy at your age?

234
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,600
What did I do?

235
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,240
Who gave him the film?

236
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:26,200
Don't do it again.
He's crazy. Crazy, I tell you!

237
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,240
All I hear about is movies
and Alfredo.

238
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,800
Alfredo and movies!

239
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:34,200
Swear you won't let him in again.
Swear it!

240
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,320
You have my word.

241
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,920
May God grant me one wish.

242
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,560
May he send your father home
to whip you!

243
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:49,360
Papa won't come back,
and I know why.

244
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,800
He's dead.

245
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,280
That's not true.

246
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,840
I'll show you. He'll come back.

247
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:30,840
""Thus man's good
and evil deeds do pass...

248
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:34,960
while time flows on like a river.''

249
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,240
They smoke like chimneys!

250
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,680
No. Go buy a ticket.

251
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,720
What was that?

252
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,120
I'll make mincemeat out of you!
You'll have to reckon with me!

253
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,080
Signora Anna!

254
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:12,480
Don't blame me. Your wife
told me to bring your lunch.

255
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:17,640
I told my mother
you didn't give me the film.

256
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,320
It wasn't your fault.

257
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:24,120
I thought it was a joke
about film catching fire.

258
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,080
I just wanted to tell you.
Now I'll go.

259
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:32,840
Toto, come here.

260
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:37,080
Come on and sit down.

261
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:43,760
Now listen.
I got into this business at age ten.

262
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,480
Back then, we didn't have
fancy machines.

263
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,320
Movies were silent.

264
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,840
You turned the projector by hand...

265
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,320
with a crank.

266
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,480
All the livelong day!

267
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:01,120
And that damn crank
was so hard.

268
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:04,880
If you got tired
and slowed down a bit...

269
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:08,840
like a shot-- voom!--
everything went up in flames.

270
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:13,960
So why not teach me?

271
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:17,080
Now that there's no crank
and it's easier.

272
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:20,880
Because I don't want to.

273
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:23,560
This is no job for you.

274
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:25,920
You're like a slave...

275
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,920
and always by yourself.

276
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:31,280
You see a film 1 00 times.
You've nothing else to do.

277
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:35,200
You talk to Greta Garbo
and Tyrone Power like an idiot.

278
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,160
You work like a dog.

279
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:41,080
Even holidays--
Easter, Christmas.

280
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:43,600
You only get Good Friday off.

281
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:47,160
And if they hadn't
stuck Christ on a cross...

282
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:49,560
we'd even work then.

283
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:52,280
So why don't you change jobs?

284
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,920
Because I'm a nitwit.

285
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,440
Who else around here
could run a projector?

286
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:11,080
Nobody. It takes
an imbecile like me.

287
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,680
I never had any luck.

288
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,200
When I was little,
there was a war.

289
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:22,480
When I grew up,
there was another war.

290
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,120
So, you want to be a stick-in-the-mud
like me? How about it?

291
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,360
Attaboy, Toto.

292
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,560
I'm telling you
for your own good.

293
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:42,200
In here, you suffocate in summer
and freeze to death in winter.

294
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,440
You breathe all these fumes.

295
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:47,240
And you earn chicken feed.

296
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:50,320
Don't you like
anything about it?

297
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,240
Oh, you get used to it.

298
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,240
Sometimes you can hear...

299
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,440
that the house is full of people...

300
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,600
laughing and having fun.

301
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,040
Then you're happy too.

302
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,760
It makes you feel good
to hear them.

303
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,360
Like you're the one
who made them laugh--

304
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:10,560
who made them forget
their troubles.

305
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,320
That part I like.

306
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:28,080
I might as well be speaking Greek!
What're you up to?

307
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:31,800
You pretend to listen,
then you trick me!

308
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:35,000
Your mother's right!
You're crazy!

309
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:40,200
How'd the rascal do it?
He learned by watching.

310
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:46,720
I'm telling the cashier
not to let you in!

311
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:52,400
And I'll see Father Adelfio!
No more altar boy! Finished!

312
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,760
Up yours!

313
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:08,600
I got it! I won!
I won the football lottery!

314
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:19,160
The Neapolitan won the lottery!

315
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:24,440
Hey, Ciccio from Naples
won the lottery!

316
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:29,560
It's always the northerners
who get lucky.

317
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,800
The square is mine! All mine!

318
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:11,400
Hold still!
Got ants in your pants?

319
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,800
You got a lice factory up here.

320
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,520
Beat it.

321
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,000
What're you after?

322
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,840
Get out of here.

323
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:48,360
A merchant owns two stores.

324
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:53,280
In one, he sells fruit.

325
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,480
Be seated.

326
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,720
Professor...

327
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:01,680
the night-school students are here
for the grade-school diploma exam.

328
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,120
Silence!

329
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:00,000
Rotten little stinker!

330
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:03,080
- Toto, help me.
- Silence!

331
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,720
I can't do this damn thing!

332
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:27,280
<i>Francesco Messana...</i>

333
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:29,320
<i>you're under arrest.</i>

334
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,280
Good riddance!

335
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:47,840
Kiss my ass!
Pencil pusher!

336
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:50,720
Right here is where
it can catch fire.

337
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:55,800
If it does, cut here and here,
or the whole reel will burn. Got it?

338
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:05,200
Never!
We'll never have that here.

339
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:07,600
Which side is the gelatin on?

340
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:12,120
It tastes good.

341
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:25,240
The shipping invoice for the film.
Always keep these.

342
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:27,000
I will, Alfredo.

343
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:28,880
Don't ever forget them.

344
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:50,720
This is for you.
Today you load the reels yourself.

345
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:55,720
- It's so high!
- Now you can run it alone.

346
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:58,080
Hold it.

347
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:04,600
- What a build!
- My turn!

348
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:08,400
Say good-bye to Peppino.
He's leaving for Germany.

349
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:19,680
Why won't you say good-bye?

350
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:22,960
My father says he's a communist.

351
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:24,920
God keep you, Mama.

352
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:27,240
Will he really find work
in Germany?

353
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:30,320
Who knows?
It's an adventure.

354
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,280
All you can do is hope.

355
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:35,520
Screw this country!

356
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:40,880
Go work in Germany,
you and your Stalin.

357
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,800
Good-bye, Mama.

358
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:47,400
Good-bye, Peppino!
Come back soon!

359
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,400
We'll see you.

360
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:58,480
Lucky thing Germany
is closer than Russia.

361
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:05,440
<i>After six years,
the return of spring fashion.</i>

362
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:08,200
<i>Fresh and breezy...</i>

363
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:10,880
<i>unlike the stodgy wartime styles.</i>

364
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:30,000
I'll make mincemeat out of you!

365
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:31,960
""You'll have to reckon with me!''

366
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,280
<i>Another sad chapter...</i>

367
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:57,240
<i>in the tragedy
of our men in Russia.</i>

368
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:59,400
<i>The Defense Ministry...</i>

369
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:02,440
<i>has released a new list
of Italian soldiers killed in battle...</i>

370
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:05,280
<i>until now considered missing.</i>

371
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:09,960
<i>The names will be posted
by local military authorities...</i>

372
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,960
<i>who will directly notify
the families involved.</i>

373
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:21,840
<i>However, we don't know
where he's buried.</i>

374
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:25,240
<i>Here's the form for the pension.
Sign it, please.</i>

375
00:48:57,240 --> 00:49:00,640
Get out! Go home!
We can't have another show!

376
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:05,240
It's late. Be reasonable.
We can't show it again!

377
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:09,760
Some people
sat through it twice!

378
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:15,800
We've been waiting for an hour!

379
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:23,920
Tomorrow we'll have
another movie.

380
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:28,440
A western. Word of honor!
Go home to bed.

381
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:35,000
They'll wreck the Paradiso!
All hell will break loose!

382
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:41,520
Alfredo, let us in!

383
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:44,600
What can I do?

384
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:51,760
""A mob doesn't think.

385
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:53,960
They don't know
what they're doing.''

386
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:58,960
<i>Spencer Tracy said that in Fury.</i>

387
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:01,920
Well, what do you say?

388
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:05,720
Shall we let the poor devils
see their film?

389
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:09,920
Sure. But how?

390
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:16,800
""If you have no faith in me,
have faith in what you see.''

391
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:19,960
Now get your butt off that stool.

392
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:25,080
Get ready.

393
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:29,160
Abracadabra.

394
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:33,560
Look the other direction.

395
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:09,360
Go look out the window.

396
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:16,640
Alfredo, it's beautiful.

397
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:20,720
Over there! It's the movie!

398
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:25,480
Bravo, Alfredo!

399
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:32,240
Thank you, Alfredo!

400
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:41,240
What's going on?

401
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:44,960
It's a movie!

402
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:49,320
To hell with you all!

403
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:58,080
There's no sound!

404
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:00,840
Shall we make them happy?

405
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:34,280
Want to go down?

406
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:36,880
Go on.

407
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:55,040
- Look.
- Good Lord!

408
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:03,360
And Nunzio, half price.

409
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:18,120
You have to buy tickets, folks.

410
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:22,640
Reduced rates.

411
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:25,560
Up yours! The square
belongs to everyone!

412
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:27,560
Oh, no!

413
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:31,440
The square is mine! Don't joke
about that or you'll piss me off!.

414
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:14,320
Someone, help me!

415
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:42,560
- Nunzio, what's wrong with you?
- I can't breathe!

416
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:11,520
Alfredo! Alfredo!

417
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:21,520
Help! Help!

418
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:27,520
Help!

419
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:41,400
Poor Alfredo.
What a shame.

420
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:47,160
All burned!

421
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:52,160
It all burned down!

422
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:09,720
What do we do now?

423
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:13,440
We have no more entertainment.
Nothing.

424
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:16,680
Where will we get the money
to rebuild?

425
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:22,400
Take a look at Ciccio.
So spiffy, you'd hardly know him.

426
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:25,760
Who has that kind of money?

427
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:36,440
The new Cinema Paradiso!

428
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:41,680
Come in, come in!

429
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:13,680
This theater is for you!

430
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:24,400
He's just a boy.
What about labor laws?

431
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:28,120
I got the license
through connections.

432
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:30,400
Don't ask me
how their minds work.

433
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:35,120
Officially, I'm the projectionist,
but the money goes to Toto.

434
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:39,160
Stay on your toes, Toto.
No sleeping.

435
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:41,400
We've had enough disasters.

436
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:44,280
Do what poor Alfredo taught you.

437
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:46,040
And God bless you.

438
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:48,880
Thank you, Father.

439
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:54,080
What is this, a funeral?
Life goes on! Gaiety! Music!

440
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,160
Get a load of that!

441
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:35,560
Our Father!

442
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:57,800
By God, they're kissing!

443
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:05,120
I won't watch pornography.

444
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:12,720
Three cheers for Ciccio!

445
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,360
Any room for me
in this new paradise?

446
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:52,320
Bring him home after you close.

447
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:54,120
I'm going, Alfredo.

448
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:55,880
I'm glad you're here.

449
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:01,840
How're things at school?

450
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:05,200
Fine, but now that I'm working...

451
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:07,240
maybe I won't go anymore.

452
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:09,240
No. No, Toto.

453
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:12,840
Don't do that.

454
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:15,320
You'll end up
with egg on your face.

455
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:18,040
Why? What does that mean?

456
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:19,960
It means...

457
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:25,520
that this isn't your real work.

458
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:28,280
Right now
the Paradiso needs you...

459
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:30,320
and you need the Paradiso...

460
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:31,680
but it's a stopgap.

461
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:35,400
One day you'll go on...

462
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:37,400
to other things.

463
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:38,480
Things...

464
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:43,000
that are more important.

465
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,040
Definitely more important.

466
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:50,440
I know.

467
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:53,680
Now that I've lost my sight,
I see better.

468
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:56,400
Things I never saw before.

469
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:59,840
All thanks to you,
who saved my life.

470
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:01,760
I won't forget it.

471
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:05,600
And don't look like that.

472
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:08,160
I'm not senile yet.
Want proof?

473
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:11,520
Well, let's see.

474
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:13,480
For example...

475
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:17,520
right now, the film's out of focus.

476
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:18,680
Go check.

477
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:25,680
You're right!
It's out of focus.

478
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:27,280
How'd you know?

479
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,200
Too hard to explain.

480
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:42,800
Only two days?

481
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:44,800
What do I care
if you've rented all the prints?

482
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:48,520
I've only had it two days.
They'll rip my head off here!

483
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:53,880
I wouldn't make it
even if I opened at 8:00 a.m.!

484
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:56,480
This is a big town,
and you know it!

485
01:03:56,520 --> 01:03:59,360
If you screw me over,
I'll go straight to Rome!

486
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:01,360
You'll pay for this!

487
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:05,240
Don't mess with me,
'cause I'll split your skull open!

488
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:07,800
Don Ciccio, I have an idea.

489
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:11,000
Do you remember
that old abandoned movie theater?

490
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,440
What about it?

491
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:16,280
The projector's rusted,
but I could fix it in a couple of days.

492
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:19,000
You have the place cleaned up...

493
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:23,720
hire a projectionist from the city,
and we'll have two theaters!

494
01:04:23,720 --> 01:04:25,560
Bullshit!

495
01:04:25,560 --> 01:04:27,480
Don't start, Toto.

496
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:30,720
Titanus will only let me have
one print.

497
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:32,720
If I ask for another one,
they'll cut my head off...

498
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:35,920
and play ball with it.

499
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:38,680
Who says we need two copies?

500
01:04:38,680 --> 01:04:40,320
Well, don't we?

501
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:20,680
We see the crib.
The child's asleep.

502
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:41,240
<i>Help her.!</i>

503
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:47,720
""The lawyer told me.
Now I know.''

504
01:05:47,840 --> 01:05:51,040
<i>The lawyer told me.
Now I know.</i>

505
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:56,480
""And everyone must know.
Yes, everyone must know.''

506
01:05:56,600 --> 01:05:58,280
<i>Everyone must know.</i>

507
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:02,800
""You believe me?''

508
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:07,360
""Yes, I believe you.''

509
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,600
""Our own home.
How I've dreamed of it!''

510
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:32,800
""Tonino!''

511
01:06:37,640 --> 01:06:38,760
""Mama.''

512
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:00,040
""The End.''

513
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:12,600
I don't like it!
I don't like it!

514
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:20,640
I cut the end credits
to go faster.

515
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:25,120
Hurry back with part one.
I'll show a newsreel.

516
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:27,680
I'll call the police.
Take him.

517
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:31,880
Just a minute.
Just a minute!

518
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:43,560
What do you want?

519
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:54,840
Give me part two.
Here's part one.

520
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:57,560
Hurry, the house is packed.

521
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:04,960
What are you doing? Hurry up!
Light the coal, come on!

522
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:08,880
- The audience is protesting!
- Get her rolling!

523
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:17,520
Bunch of animals!
Quiet!

524
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:40,640
To hell with it!

525
01:08:47,050 --> 01:08:48,970
Toto, what's going on?

526
01:08:49,050 --> 01:08:51,170
What the hell is he doing?

527
01:08:53,850 --> 01:08:56,690
Come on, Toto.
They're gonna explode!

528
01:08:56,730 --> 01:08:58,730
It's been a half hour!

529
01:08:58,850 --> 01:09:00,690
What can I do?

530
01:09:02,570 --> 01:09:06,050
Where is that son of a jackass?
I'll be ruined!

531
01:09:07,130 --> 01:09:10,050
Calm down, calm down.

532
01:09:13,010 --> 01:09:16,210
I'll have you know,
just to see this movie...

533
01:09:16,330 --> 01:09:19,010
I left my wife home
sick in bed...

534
01:09:19,210 --> 01:09:21,570
and I haven't seen a thing.

535
01:09:21,570 --> 01:09:24,730
If it's not here in ten minutes,
give us back our money...

536
01:09:24,770 --> 01:09:27,130
me and everyone else here...

537
01:09:27,130 --> 01:09:29,570
or I'll wreck the place
with this cane!

538
01:09:34,730 --> 01:09:39,090
Calm down!
Calm down and let me talk.

539
01:09:39,130 --> 01:09:42,050
Tell you what.
I'll show part one over again.

540
01:09:48,250 --> 01:09:51,250
Quiet, quiet!

541
01:09:51,250 --> 01:09:55,210
I've seen the whole movie.
I'll tell you the plot.

542
01:10:25,690 --> 01:10:27,250
Boccia, what happened?

543
01:10:33,930 --> 01:10:36,570
- What are you doing?
- I'm in heaven.

544
01:10:37,010 --> 01:10:38,890
Get out of here!

545
01:10:39,010 --> 01:10:40,610
Scram!

546
01:10:41,490 --> 01:10:42,770
It feels so good!

547
01:11:12,650 --> 01:11:17,610
What's the idea?
Watch the screen, you perverts!

548
01:11:27,290 --> 01:11:28,370
Don't touch.

549
01:12:21,690 --> 01:12:24,450
I told you:
It doesn't catch fire.

550
01:12:28,610 --> 01:12:30,850
Progress always comes too late.

551
01:12:50,130 --> 01:12:52,490
<i>Workers--</i>

552
01:13:19,410 --> 01:13:21,130
That's right.

553
01:13:22,090 --> 01:13:23,850
Now you've got it.

554
01:13:23,850 --> 01:13:27,210
Come on, take it easy.

555
01:13:27,850 --> 01:13:29,570
Don't be afraid.

556
01:13:29,650 --> 01:13:32,370
Do I really have to squeeze
a lemon on it if it bleeds?

557
01:13:32,450 --> 01:13:34,370
Lemon?

558
01:13:36,090 --> 01:13:39,410
Whoever told you such bullshit?

559
01:13:41,290 --> 01:13:43,770
That's right, keep going.

560
01:13:45,810 --> 01:13:47,930
That's right. See?

561
01:13:48,570 --> 01:13:50,770
It's not dangerous, see?

562
01:13:50,770 --> 01:13:52,290
That's right, keep going.

563
01:14:05,690 --> 01:14:07,450
Now you're really a man.

564
01:14:07,650 --> 01:14:11,690
What am I saying?
You're not a man, you're a bull!

565
01:14:52,890 --> 01:14:55,090
She's new.

566
01:14:55,930 --> 01:14:57,810
Not bad.

567
01:14:57,810 --> 01:14:59,210
She looks nice.

568
01:14:59,210 --> 01:15:03,170
Her father's the bank manager.
Pride, pomp and circumstance.

569
01:15:03,290 --> 01:15:06,730
Jerks off with his shirt
to keep his hands clean.

570
01:15:11,130 --> 01:15:12,970
Go, man, go!

571
01:15:28,930 --> 01:15:30,250
Excuse me.

572
01:15:36,410 --> 01:15:38,410
You dropped this.

573
01:15:38,450 --> 01:15:40,010
Oh, thanks.

574
01:15:40,010 --> 01:15:42,170
I didn't even notice.

575
01:15:43,770 --> 01:15:46,170
My name's Salvatore.
What's yours?

576
01:15:46,210 --> 01:15:48,610
Elena.
My name's Elena.

577
01:15:48,690 --> 01:15:53,370
I wanted to tell you, well,
the other day at the station--

578
01:15:58,490 --> 01:16:01,410
<i>It's Charlie Chaplin's
Modern Times, right, Toto?</i>

579
01:16:01,490 --> 01:16:03,010
Yes, that's right.

580
01:16:04,090 --> 01:16:07,250
I know that film by heart.

581
01:16:07,410 --> 01:16:11,330
While I was showing it for the
first time in 1 940, my first wife died.

582
01:16:11,650 --> 01:16:15,370
They kept it from me all day,
to keep the theater open.

583
01:16:15,930 --> 01:16:18,410
I found out after the last show.

584
01:16:20,610 --> 01:16:22,370
I lost my mind.

585
01:16:25,330 --> 01:16:27,290
It's the kind of thing
you never forget.

586
01:16:29,370 --> 01:16:32,290
The small projector?
Your footage?

587
01:16:32,290 --> 01:16:33,970
What do you see?

588
01:16:34,050 --> 01:16:37,690
Slaughterhouse workers
butchering a calf.

589
01:16:37,690 --> 01:16:41,930
Blood all over the floor,
like a lake.

590
01:16:41,930 --> 01:16:44,530
Another calf passes over the lake...

591
01:16:44,610 --> 01:16:46,810
on his way to being slaughtered.

592
01:16:52,930 --> 01:16:55,450
Why'd you stop?
What do we see?

593
01:16:55,530 --> 01:16:59,490
Nothing. We don't see anything.
It's all fuzzy.

594
01:17:02,330 --> 01:17:03,370
A woman.

595
01:17:05,570 --> 01:17:07,530
It's a woman.

596
01:17:08,690 --> 01:17:11,490
Yes, a girl I saw
at the station.

597
01:17:12,170 --> 01:17:14,570
What's she like?

598
01:17:14,690 --> 01:17:16,490
She's very nice.

599
01:17:17,290 --> 01:17:21,690
My age, slim,
long brown hair.

600
01:17:21,810 --> 01:17:25,770
Big blue eyes,
honest and direct.

601
01:17:25,810 --> 01:17:27,930
A little beauty mark
on her lip.

602
01:17:27,970 --> 01:17:31,410
Very small.
You only see it up close.

603
01:17:31,410 --> 01:17:36,770
When she smiles, you feel like--
I don't know.

604
01:17:37,930 --> 01:17:39,290
Love.

605
01:17:40,530 --> 01:17:42,770
Love.

606
01:17:46,650 --> 01:17:51,730
I know how it is.
The blue-eyed ones are the worst.

607
01:17:51,850 --> 01:17:55,450
No matter what you do,
they'll never be your friends.

608
01:17:55,490 --> 01:17:57,050
There's nothing you can do.

609
01:17:57,210 --> 01:18:00,770
The bigger the man,
the deeper the footprint.

610
01:18:01,010 --> 01:18:06,290
And if he loves, he suffers,
knowing it's a dead-end street.

611
01:18:06,330 --> 01:18:08,930
That's nice,
what you just said.

612
01:18:08,930 --> 01:18:10,330
But sad.

613
01:18:12,010 --> 01:18:16,090
<i>I didn't say it. It was John Wayne
in The Shepherd of the Hills.</i>

614
01:18:16,970 --> 01:18:19,130
You old pirate!

615
01:18:59,090 --> 01:19:00,530
Hello, Elena.

616
01:19:01,450 --> 01:19:03,490
Why are you running?

617
01:19:03,890 --> 01:19:05,650
Because...

618
01:19:07,050 --> 01:19:09,730
I wanted to tell you--

619
01:19:10,410 --> 01:19:13,090
You remember when we--

620
01:19:15,210 --> 01:19:17,290
Nice day, isn't it?

621
01:19:21,690 --> 01:19:24,450
Yes, really nice.

622
01:19:26,330 --> 01:19:29,410
Excuse me, I have to go.
Bye.

623
01:19:33,290 --> 01:19:37,930
What a jerk. What a jerk!

624
01:19:38,090 --> 01:19:39,930
""Nice day, isn't it?''

625
01:19:40,090 --> 01:19:41,650
What an idiot!

626
01:19:51,650 --> 01:19:53,250
You may not believe me...

627
01:19:53,290 --> 01:19:55,450
but I'll play the leading male role
in the story of your life.

628
01:19:55,570 --> 01:20:00,490
Sure, I'm no Marlon Brando,
but take a good look at me.

629
01:20:00,610 --> 01:20:02,530
Am I really so ugly?

630
01:20:06,130 --> 01:20:08,090
So should I give it another try?

631
01:20:08,130 --> 01:20:10,530
Maybe this time I'll succeed.
What do you think?

632
01:20:18,770 --> 01:20:21,290
Hello, I'd like to speak
to Elena, please.

633
01:20:21,330 --> 01:20:23,210
<i>- This is she.
- Elena, is that you?</i>

634
01:20:23,330 --> 01:20:26,050
<i>- Yes.
- I'm sorry, I didn't recognize you.</i>

635
01:20:26,170 --> 01:20:28,290
This is Salvatore.
Do you remember me?

636
01:20:29,210 --> 01:20:32,770
Listen, I know I make a fool
of myself every time we meet...

637
01:20:32,890 --> 01:20:36,410
but I swear, it's just that
you make me shy.

638
01:20:36,410 --> 01:20:39,210
But the truth is
I do nothing but think of you.

639
01:20:40,410 --> 01:20:43,170
Yes, Elena, you're my last thought
before I fall asleep...

640
01:20:43,330 --> 01:20:46,450
and the first when I wake up.
I dream of you every night.

641
01:20:46,450 --> 01:20:48,770
It doesn't sound romantic
over the phone, but I care about you--

642
01:20:48,890 --> 01:20:51,290
<i>If you don't stop calling,
I'll call the police.</i>

643
01:20:51,410 --> 01:20:52,810
Who's this?

644
01:20:52,890 --> 01:20:55,050
<i>I'm Elena's mother,you idiot.!</i>

645
01:20:55,330 --> 01:20:58,050
I'm sorry, ma'am.
Please believe me, I didn't know--

646
01:20:59,370 --> 01:21:01,290
Oh, shit!

647
01:21:02,090 --> 01:21:03,650
I told you so.

648
01:21:03,690 --> 01:21:05,970
You thought I was joking.

649
01:21:06,050 --> 01:21:11,090
But take it from me:
The blue-eyed ones are the worst.

650
01:21:11,250 --> 01:21:14,730
But why? There must be a way
to make her understand.

651
01:21:14,810 --> 01:21:19,410
Don't even try. With feelings,
there's nothing to understand...

652
01:21:19,490 --> 01:21:21,810
and no way to explain.

653
01:21:22,010 --> 01:21:25,170
You talk like you made the world!

654
01:21:25,330 --> 01:21:28,810
Toto, calm down.
Don't take it out on me.

655
01:21:28,930 --> 01:21:30,690
That's all I need.

656
01:21:31,890 --> 01:21:35,450
- Where'd you go?
- Get out of the way!

657
01:21:35,450 --> 01:21:37,210
Toto! Come back here!

658
01:21:40,890 --> 01:21:42,850
I can't walk on my own.

659
01:21:53,250 --> 01:21:56,210
You better watch your mouth!

660
01:21:56,250 --> 01:21:59,130
With all due respect
to the Lord...

661
01:21:59,210 --> 01:22:01,370
who made the world
in two or three days--

662
01:22:01,450 --> 01:22:04,010
I'd have taken a bit longer...

663
01:22:04,090 --> 01:22:06,930
but in all modesty,
I would've done it better.

664
01:22:07,050 --> 01:22:10,930
Like I said:
You always have an answer.

665
01:22:12,850 --> 01:22:17,450
Just for you, Toto,
I'll tell you a story.

666
01:22:17,570 --> 01:22:19,410
Let's sit down a minute.

667
01:22:19,410 --> 01:22:21,850
These old bones of mine--

668
01:22:23,170 --> 01:22:25,050
Once upon a time...

669
01:22:26,010 --> 01:22:28,530
a king gave a feast...

670
01:22:28,650 --> 01:22:32,130
for the loveliest princesses
in the realm.

671
01:22:32,250 --> 01:22:36,250
Now, a soldier
who was standing guard...

672
01:22:36,370 --> 01:22:38,810
saw the king's daughter go by.

673
01:22:38,930 --> 01:22:41,330
She was the most beautiful of all...

674
01:22:41,370 --> 01:22:44,570
and he instantly fell in love.

675
01:22:44,650 --> 01:22:47,370
But what is a simple soldier...

676
01:22:47,490 --> 01:22:50,050
next to the daughter of a king?

677
01:22:50,570 --> 01:22:55,290
Well, at last he succeeded
in meeting her...

678
01:22:55,650 --> 01:22:59,250
and told her he could no longer
live without her.

679
01:22:59,450 --> 01:23:04,210
The princess was so taken
by the depth of his feeling...

680
01:23:04,210 --> 01:23:06,530
that she said to the soldier...

681
01:23:06,530 --> 01:23:09,490
""If you can wait...

682
01:23:09,530 --> 01:23:14,050
for 1 00 days and 1 00 nights
under my balcony...

683
01:23:14,170 --> 01:23:18,370
at the end
I shall be yours.''

684
01:23:20,090 --> 01:23:24,370
With that, the soldier went
and waited one day...

685
01:23:24,490 --> 01:23:27,290
two days, then ten,
then twenty.

686
01:23:27,290 --> 01:23:30,450
Each evening
the princess looked out...

687
01:23:30,530 --> 01:23:32,610
and he never moved!

688
01:23:32,610 --> 01:23:36,330
In rain, in wind, in snow,
he was always there.

689
01:23:36,370 --> 01:23:39,610
Birds shit on his head,
bees stung him...

690
01:23:39,690 --> 01:23:41,570
but he didn't budge.

691
01:23:43,130 --> 01:23:44,970
At the end...

692
01:23:46,170 --> 01:23:47,970
of 90 nights...

693
01:23:49,690 --> 01:23:51,610
he had become...

694
01:23:53,890 --> 01:23:56,930
all dry, all white.

695
01:23:56,970 --> 01:24:00,610
Tears streamed from his eyes.

696
01:24:00,690 --> 01:24:02,890
He couldn't hold them back.

697
01:24:02,890 --> 01:24:06,970
He didn't even have
the strength to sleep.

698
01:24:07,050 --> 01:24:12,090
All that time,
the princess watched him.

699
01:24:12,290 --> 01:24:16,810
At long last
it was the 99th night...

700
01:24:16,850 --> 01:24:19,650
and the soldier stood up...

701
01:24:19,730 --> 01:24:21,730
took his chair...

702
01:24:21,850 --> 01:24:23,330
and left.

703
01:24:23,330 --> 01:24:25,210
What? After all that?

704
01:24:26,970 --> 01:24:29,370
After all that.

705
01:24:29,370 --> 01:24:32,290
And don't ask what it means.
I don't know.

706
01:24:34,690 --> 01:24:37,690
If you understand it,
you tell me.

707
01:25:56,890 --> 01:25:58,930
Alfredo, what is it?

708
01:25:58,930 --> 01:26:01,170
I can't.
It's time for Mass.

709
01:26:01,250 --> 01:26:04,770
Father, I need you urgently...

710
01:26:04,810 --> 01:26:07,370
because I have doubts...

711
01:26:07,490 --> 01:26:09,610
terrible doubts
tormenting my soul.

712
01:26:09,730 --> 01:26:10,770
Your soul!

713
01:26:17,530 --> 01:26:18,570
Father, I've sinned.

714
01:26:18,730 --> 01:26:20,290
- We can discuss that later.
- But who--

715
01:26:20,410 --> 01:26:22,330
Stay there. Don't move.

716
01:26:22,450 --> 01:26:24,850
Just act normal.
It's Salvatore.

717
01:26:24,930 --> 01:26:26,530
How'd you get in there?

718
01:26:29,890 --> 01:26:33,010
Alfredo, that's
a terrible thing to say.

719
01:26:33,090 --> 01:26:34,650
I know.

720
01:26:34,690 --> 01:26:37,890
But take the miracle
of the loaves and fishes.

721
01:26:37,890 --> 01:26:40,290
What about it?

722
01:26:40,290 --> 01:26:44,250
I always wonder:
How is it possible?

723
01:26:44,330 --> 01:26:46,250
All hell broke loose.

724
01:26:46,330 --> 01:26:49,970
My mother told my father.
How could you mistake her for me?

725
01:26:50,450 --> 01:26:52,730
Forgive me, Elena.
I was a real fool.

726
01:26:52,810 --> 01:26:55,130
I had to talk to you.

727
01:27:04,370 --> 01:27:06,650
You're so beautiful, Elena.

728
01:27:06,730 --> 01:27:08,690
That's what I wanted to tell you.

729
01:27:08,770 --> 01:27:13,170
When we meet,
I can't say anything right...

730
01:27:13,290 --> 01:27:16,610
because you make me tremble.

731
01:27:16,650 --> 01:27:20,570
I don't know what others do
in a case like this.

732
01:27:20,570 --> 01:27:21,890
It's my first time.

733
01:27:24,410 --> 01:27:26,570
But I'm in love with you.

734
01:27:26,570 --> 01:27:28,930
Father, I have sinned.

735
01:27:29,010 --> 01:27:30,970
I absolve you
in the name of the Father...

736
01:27:31,170 --> 01:27:32,530
the Son and the Holy Ghost.

737
01:27:32,610 --> 01:27:34,410
Go in peace.

738
01:27:38,730 --> 01:27:41,330
When you smile,
you're even prettier.

739
01:27:48,330 --> 01:27:52,930
Salvatore, you're very sweet,
and I like you very much...

740
01:27:52,930 --> 01:27:55,490
but I don't love you.

741
01:27:59,050 --> 01:28:01,290
I don't care.
I'll wait.

742
01:28:01,330 --> 01:28:03,010
What?

743
01:28:03,050 --> 01:28:05,610
Until you fall in love with me.

744
01:28:05,690 --> 01:28:07,570
Now listen.

745
01:28:08,850 --> 01:28:12,850
Every night after work,
I'll come stand outside your house.

746
01:28:13,010 --> 01:28:14,850
And I'll wait. Every night.

747
01:28:15,890 --> 01:28:18,770
When you change your mind,
open your window.

748
01:28:18,810 --> 01:28:21,170
That's all.
I'll understand.

749
01:28:21,210 --> 01:28:22,570
You understand now?

750
01:28:22,570 --> 01:28:27,730
Yes, I finally see the light.

751
01:28:31,090 --> 01:28:33,850
Next time, don't talk heresy.

752
01:28:34,850 --> 01:28:36,850
You survived the fire
in the theater...

753
01:28:36,970 --> 01:28:41,250
but no one can save you
from eternal fire!

754
01:30:07,610 --> 01:30:09,530
What's keeping Toto?

755
01:30:10,970 --> 01:30:12,930
The theater's closed by now.

756
01:30:32,530 --> 01:30:36,610
<i>Fifteen seconds to the New Year.!</i>

757
01:30:37,330 --> 01:30:40,570
1 4, 1 3, 1 2--

758
01:30:55,130 --> 01:30:58,530
I wouldn't worry.
He must be with his friends.

759
01:30:58,690 --> 01:31:02,050
- Let's have a toast.
- Happy New Year!

760
01:31:04,850 --> 01:31:07,450
Happy New Year!

761
01:31:08,050 --> 01:31:10,850
- To Toto as well.
- To Toto!

762
01:33:21,450 --> 01:33:23,890
The movie's over!
Turn the lights on!

763
01:34:08,170 --> 01:34:10,610
This is just the test drive.

764
01:34:15,810 --> 01:34:17,810
How'll we get home?

765
01:34:22,770 --> 01:34:25,290
Oh, God, it's my father!

766
01:34:27,290 --> 01:34:28,570
Good evening, Mr. Mendola.

767
01:34:43,130 --> 01:34:45,090
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, good evening.</i>

768
01:34:45,130 --> 01:34:49,730
<i>The :Teatro della Fiera'"in Milan
presents Double Your Money...</i>

769
01:34:49,850 --> 01:34:51,730
<i>hosted by Mike Bongiorno.</i>

770
01:34:58,450 --> 01:35:00,890
<i>What do you know?
I forgot my lines.</i>

771
01:35:01,810 --> 01:35:03,770
You're kidding me, right?

772
01:35:03,810 --> 01:35:06,450
How can you see this ""television''
without any film?

773
01:35:06,530 --> 01:35:09,090
- That's the way it works.
- With no film?

774
01:35:09,970 --> 01:35:13,690
And if you buy a television set,
you can watch it at home.

775
01:35:13,690 --> 01:35:15,890
That may be, but I don't like it.

776
01:35:16,290 --> 01:35:18,210
There's something fishy about it.

777
01:35:18,250 --> 01:35:19,850
<i>- Massa--?
- Macinaia.</i>

778
01:35:19,970 --> 01:35:21,850
<i>Massa Macinaia.</i>

779
01:35:22,050 --> 01:35:24,130
<i>It must be close to Massa Carrara.</i>

780
01:35:24,250 --> 01:35:26,170
<i>No. It's near Lucca.</i>

781
01:35:27,610 --> 01:35:30,210
Isn't this a marvelous invention?

782
01:35:30,250 --> 01:35:33,210
But how was I supposed to buy
the equipment without a mortgage?

783
01:35:33,530 --> 01:35:37,690
In this day and age,
one has to keep up with the times.

784
01:35:38,210 --> 01:35:41,250
It's a new machine
called a teleprojector.

785
01:35:50,490 --> 01:35:52,210
<i>What are you going to perform
this evening?</i>

786
01:35:52,250 --> 01:35:54,970
The Divine Comedy.

787
01:35:55,650 --> 01:35:58,370
Maybe your father
looks down on my job.

788
01:35:58,490 --> 01:36:00,650
Or the fact my family is poor.
Is that it?

789
01:36:04,730 --> 01:36:07,170
As soon as school is out,
we're going to Tuscany.

790
01:36:07,930 --> 01:36:10,450
If you come up there,
we can meet secretly.

791
01:36:10,930 --> 01:36:14,410
I have to work all summer.
What am I going to do without you?

792
01:36:14,930 --> 01:36:17,810
Don't worry.
I'll write you every day.

793
01:36:18,250 --> 01:36:21,490
I love you. The summer will end,
and I'll come back.

794
01:36:44,650 --> 01:36:47,970
""Summer Screenings Will Be Held
at the Arena Imperia''

795
01:36:59,530 --> 01:37:01,330
Standing room only!

796
01:37:01,890 --> 01:37:04,530
Get in for free,
but pay to get out!

797
01:37:13,370 --> 01:37:15,650
Come on in.
The show just started.

798
01:37:15,890 --> 01:37:17,650
Have your tickets ready.

799
01:37:48,730 --> 01:37:50,330
<i>Salvatore, my love...</i>

800
01:37:50,410 --> 01:37:52,290
<i>the days here drag on forever.</i>

801
01:37:52,330 --> 01:37:56,090
<i>I see your name everywhere."
in a book, a crossword puzzle...</i>

802
01:37:56,170 --> 01:37:57,890
<i>a newspaper.</i>

803
01:37:57,930 --> 01:37:59,810
<i>You're always before my eyes.</i>

804
01:37:59,890 --> 01:38:02,250
<i>Today, alas, I have bad news.</i>

805
01:38:02,330 --> 01:38:05,770
<i>In October we're moving to Palermo,
where I'll go to the university.</i>

806
01:38:05,850 --> 01:38:08,330
<i>So we won't see each other
every day.</i>

807
01:38:08,330 --> 01:38:11,490
<i>But don't worry.
Whenever I can get away...</i>

808
01:38:11,490 --> 01:38:14,570
<i>I'll come to you
at the Paradiso.</i>

809
01:38:43,090 --> 01:38:45,970
I caught an octopus!

810
01:39:04,090 --> 01:39:06,090
There's a letter for you!

811
01:39:06,490 --> 01:39:09,570
One a day. Here you go.

812
01:39:10,490 --> 01:39:12,970
- You making fun of me?
- Of course!

813
01:39:25,250 --> 01:39:27,370
<i>I'm blind.!</i>

814
01:39:49,250 --> 01:39:55,850
<i>By God's might, by man's actions.!
Rise up.!</i>

815
01:40:21,730 --> 01:40:25,050
When will this rotten summer end?

816
01:40:25,770 --> 01:40:28,370
In a film, it'd already be over.

817
01:40:28,450 --> 01:40:32,090
Fade-out, cut to storm.
Wouldn't that be great?

818
01:40:45,730 --> 01:40:49,130
<i>Tell them I am Ulysses.!</i>

819
01:40:59,730 --> 01:41:01,770
Elena! But when--

820
01:41:01,810 --> 01:41:03,610
I got back today.

821
01:41:03,610 --> 01:41:06,570
You can't imagine the excuses
I made up to come here.

822
01:41:38,250 --> 01:41:41,250
You still can't beat Sophia Loren...

823
01:41:41,330 --> 01:41:44,450
with those long legs
and ample breasts.

824
01:41:44,530 --> 01:41:47,530
- Kind of like Lana Turner?
- Don Ciccio?

825
01:41:48,010 --> 01:41:50,130
This is for Toto.

826
01:41:50,210 --> 01:41:52,730
- You give it to him.
- What is it?

827
01:41:54,130 --> 01:41:57,330
Oh, my God!
What am I going to do now?

828
01:42:02,370 --> 01:42:04,330
What did they say?

829
01:42:04,370 --> 01:42:08,450
As a war orphan, I don't fall
under the mandatory draft.

830
01:42:08,490 --> 01:42:11,250
But there's nothing to be done.
They've made a clerical error.

831
01:42:11,290 --> 01:42:13,530
I leave for Rome on Friday.

832
01:42:13,650 --> 01:42:16,090
They said they'd discharge me
after ten days.

833
01:42:16,250 --> 01:42:18,810
- Come.
- No, Salvatore. You'd better go.

834
01:42:18,970 --> 01:42:20,570
My father's here.

835
01:42:20,570 --> 01:42:24,410
Good. Finally we can talk.
This time I'll make him see reason.

836
01:42:25,010 --> 01:42:28,610
I'm afraid not, Salvatore.
He has other plans for me.

837
01:42:29,770 --> 01:42:31,210
Who?

838
01:42:31,330 --> 01:42:33,490
The son of one
of his business partners.

839
01:42:33,490 --> 01:42:35,610
Don't look so sad.
We'll talk about it later.

840
01:42:35,730 --> 01:42:37,730
Wait for me Thursday
at the Paradiso.

841
01:42:37,730 --> 01:42:40,930
I'll be on the 5:00 bus.
I love you.

842
01:42:58,410 --> 01:42:59,970
""Thursday''

843
01:43:04,570 --> 01:43:05,610
""Today''

844
01:43:18,570 --> 01:43:22,330
This film is too highbrow for us.
One day is more than enough.

845
01:43:22,370 --> 01:43:27,170
Load the reels for tomorrow,
ready for the new guy.

846
01:43:27,770 --> 01:43:28,730
All right.

847
01:43:29,690 --> 01:43:32,370
Hey, cheer up!

848
01:43:32,490 --> 01:43:34,890
I'll wait for you.
Don't worry.

849
01:43:34,930 --> 01:43:36,770
The job'll still be here.

850
01:43:36,810 --> 01:43:38,450
I'll wait, you hear?

851
01:43:38,610 --> 01:43:39,850
Don't look so gloomy.

852
01:43:39,850 --> 01:43:41,810
Come on, now!

853
01:44:41,970 --> 01:44:44,130
You weren't expecting me,
were you?

854
01:44:44,770 --> 01:44:47,930
No, Alfredo.
I was coming to help you.

855
01:44:48,010 --> 01:44:50,450
No, you were expecting her.

856
01:44:51,450 --> 01:44:53,450
It's no fun to wait alone.

857
01:44:53,570 --> 01:44:55,850
It's easier
if you have company, right?

858
01:44:57,050 --> 01:44:58,850
Would you rather I left?

859
01:44:58,970 --> 01:45:02,810
No, don't go.
Listen, I need your help.

860
01:45:24,890 --> 01:45:29,250
How did he talk me into this?

861
01:45:55,050 --> 01:45:56,090
Open up!

862
01:45:57,730 --> 01:45:59,330
Open the door!

863
01:46:34,690 --> 01:46:36,250
I don't like it!

864
01:47:00,330 --> 01:47:02,330
- I'm back.
- What took you so long?

865
01:47:03,530 --> 01:47:05,290
- I'm here now.
- Where did you go?

866
01:47:06,010 --> 01:47:08,930
Calm down. It's all right.
Sit down.

867
01:47:13,810 --> 01:47:15,690
Did she come?

868
01:47:16,210 --> 01:47:18,130
No, no one came.

869
01:47:37,730 --> 01:47:41,370
Radioman Di Vita, 3rd Battalion,
9th Company, sir!

870
01:47:47,930 --> 01:47:50,370
<i>Colonel, I'd like to know
when I'll be discharged.</i>

871
01:47:50,490 --> 01:47:53,250
<i>As yet we have received
no such order. You may go.</i>

872
01:48:00,330 --> 01:48:02,850
They transferred her father?
It can't be!

873
01:48:02,970 --> 01:48:05,330
And no one knows where?

874
01:48:05,370 --> 01:48:08,450
Screw you if you won't tell me!
Asshole son of a bitch!

875
01:48:30,250 --> 01:48:32,370
Colonel, I was only supposed
to be here for ten days.

876
01:48:32,410 --> 01:48:34,650
It's been almost a year
and I haven't been home once.

877
01:48:34,770 --> 01:48:37,130
I demand to be sent home
on leave!

878
01:49:00,370 --> 01:49:03,890
Di Vita, get ready.
Your discharge came through.

879
01:50:38,490 --> 01:50:40,930
You're thinner.

880
01:50:40,930 --> 01:50:43,530
I can tell you've been unhappy.

881
01:50:43,610 --> 01:50:45,970
They tell me you never go out...

882
01:50:45,970 --> 01:50:47,890
and you never talk to anybody.

883
01:50:47,890 --> 01:50:49,570
Why?

884
01:50:50,250 --> 01:50:52,090
You know how it is.

885
01:50:53,090 --> 01:50:56,130
Sooner or later a time comes...

886
01:50:56,210 --> 01:51:01,250
when it's all the same
whether you talk or not.

887
01:51:02,970 --> 01:51:05,490
So you might as well shut up.

888
01:51:12,010 --> 01:51:13,810
It's hot in here.

889
01:51:14,970 --> 01:51:16,570
Take me to the sea.

890
01:51:16,730 --> 01:51:20,330
At a party, a lieutenant
pinches this girl's ass.

891
01:51:20,410 --> 01:51:24,170
She turns around.
It's the colonel's daughter.

892
01:51:24,250 --> 01:51:25,890
Terrified, the lieutenant says...

893
01:51:25,970 --> 01:51:30,970
""If your heart is as hard
as what I just felt, I'm a dead man.''

894
01:51:36,610 --> 01:51:38,530
You haven't seen her?

895
01:51:42,090 --> 01:51:44,370
And no one knows where she is.

896
01:51:46,090 --> 01:51:49,930
That's probably how
it was meant to be.

897
01:51:50,010 --> 01:51:54,490
Each of us has his own destiny.

898
01:51:54,570 --> 01:51:58,210
What do you plan to do now?

899
01:52:08,370 --> 01:52:09,970
I've got another one.

900
01:52:10,410 --> 01:52:12,650
The captain says to the sergeant...

901
01:52:13,050 --> 01:52:15,010
""Do you remember...

902
01:52:15,610 --> 01:52:17,530
when there was a windmill there?''

903
01:52:18,370 --> 01:52:20,410
""Yes, Captain, I remember it well.''

904
01:52:21,530 --> 01:52:23,610
The windmill is gone now...

905
01:52:23,610 --> 01:52:25,810
but the wind is still there.''

906
01:52:34,410 --> 01:52:37,090
Do you remember the story
about the soldier and the princess?

907
01:52:49,290 --> 01:52:52,090
Now I know why the soldier left
after all that time.

908
01:52:57,810 --> 01:53:00,610
One more night
and the princess would be his.

909
01:53:01,490 --> 01:53:04,930
But she might have broken
her promise...

910
01:53:05,090 --> 01:53:07,210
and that would have been terrible.

911
01:53:07,330 --> 01:53:09,610
It would have killed him.

912
01:53:09,610 --> 01:53:12,570
This way, at least,
for 99 nights...

913
01:53:12,690 --> 01:53:15,610
he had lived with the illusion
that she was waiting for him.

914
01:53:17,490 --> 01:53:19,930
Do as the soldier did, Toto.

915
01:53:20,010 --> 01:53:21,770
Get out of here.

916
01:53:22,250 --> 01:53:24,730
This land is cursed.

917
01:53:24,810 --> 01:53:27,690
Living here day after day...

918
01:53:27,770 --> 01:53:31,210
you think
it's the center of the world.

919
01:53:31,250 --> 01:53:34,970
You believe nothing
will ever change.

920
01:53:35,010 --> 01:53:38,610
Then you leave
for a year or two.

921
01:53:38,610 --> 01:53:41,210
When you come back,
everything's changed.

922
01:53:41,210 --> 01:53:43,930
The thread's broken.

923
01:53:43,930 --> 01:53:46,610
What you came to find isn't there.

924
01:53:46,690 --> 01:53:48,570
What was yours is gone.

925
01:53:48,770 --> 01:53:52,330
You have to go away
for a long time...

926
01:53:52,370 --> 01:53:54,490
many years...

927
01:53:54,690 --> 01:53:59,490
before you can come back
and find your people.

928
01:53:59,570 --> 01:54:02,890
The land where you were born.

929
01:54:02,890 --> 01:54:05,450
But not now.
It's not possible.

930
01:54:05,450 --> 01:54:08,050
Right now,
you're more blind than I am.

931
01:54:08,210 --> 01:54:11,890
Who said that? Gary Cooper?
James Stewart? Henry Fonda?

932
01:54:12,010 --> 01:54:13,850
No, Toto.

933
01:54:16,050 --> 01:54:18,410
Nobody said it.

934
01:54:19,810 --> 01:54:22,010
This time it's all me.

935
01:54:23,170 --> 01:54:26,810
Life isn't like in the movies.

936
01:54:26,890 --> 01:54:29,010
Life...

937
01:54:29,130 --> 01:54:31,010
is much harder.

938
01:54:32,570 --> 01:54:34,530
Get out of here!

939
01:54:34,690 --> 01:54:36,530
Go back to Rome.

940
01:54:36,690 --> 01:54:40,130
You're young,
and the world is yours.

941
01:54:40,890 --> 01:54:43,010
And I'm old.

942
01:54:43,810 --> 01:54:46,930
I don't want to hear you
talk anymore.

943
01:54:46,930 --> 01:54:49,290
I want to hear others
talking about you.

944
01:56:17,810 --> 01:56:19,650
Don't come back.

945
01:56:20,810 --> 01:56:22,770
Don't think about us.

946
01:56:22,810 --> 01:56:25,610
Don't look back. Don't write.

947
01:56:25,690 --> 01:56:31,010
Don't give in to nostalgia.
Forget us all.

948
01:56:31,050 --> 01:56:34,290
If you do and you come back,
don't come see me.

949
01:56:34,330 --> 01:56:37,890
I won't let you in my house.
Understand?

950
01:56:44,690 --> 01:56:46,450
Thank you.

951
01:56:47,490 --> 01:56:49,770
For everything you've done for me.

952
01:56:52,370 --> 01:56:55,250
Whatever you end up doing,
love it.

953
01:56:56,810 --> 01:56:59,250
The way you loved
the projection booth...

954
01:57:00,730 --> 01:57:03,090
when you were a little squirt.

955
01:57:11,250 --> 01:57:15,250
He's gone.
Toto! Good-bye!

956
01:57:21,650 --> 01:57:24,050
I got here too late.
What a shame!

957
01:58:20,850 --> 01:58:23,890
It's Toto. I knew it.

958
01:58:40,490 --> 01:58:42,090
- Toto.
- How are you?

959
01:58:54,530 --> 01:58:59,490
Your sister will be so glad
to see you. And the children--

960
01:58:59,490 --> 01:59:02,490
You won't recognize them,
they've grown so much.

961
01:59:02,490 --> 01:59:04,570
They always write to say
they want to come and visit.

962
01:59:04,610 --> 01:59:07,410
See how nice the house is?

963
01:59:07,410 --> 01:59:12,410
We had the whole thing redone,
all thanks to you.

964
01:59:12,530 --> 01:59:16,130
I have a surprise for you.
Come.

965
01:59:16,130 --> 01:59:18,810
Are you tired?

966
01:59:18,810 --> 01:59:21,730
You have time to rest
before the funeral.

967
01:59:21,770 --> 01:59:25,210
No, Mama,
it's only an hour by plane.

968
01:59:25,290 --> 01:59:28,970
You shouldn't have said that
after all these years.

969
01:59:28,970 --> 01:59:33,050
Come. I put all your things in here.

970
02:01:15,930 --> 02:01:18,770
He must be glad you came, Toto.

971
02:01:20,770 --> 02:01:23,610
He always talked about you.
Always.

972
02:01:25,130 --> 02:01:27,370
Right up to the end.

973
02:01:32,570 --> 02:01:34,570
He really loved you.

974
02:01:48,010 --> 02:01:50,330
He left something for you.

975
02:01:51,650 --> 02:01:53,610
Before you leave...

976
02:01:53,690 --> 02:01:55,530
come see me.

977
02:03:36,610 --> 02:03:39,170
When did you close it down?

978
02:03:39,210 --> 02:03:43,610
Six years ago in May.
Nobody came anymore.

979
02:03:43,690 --> 02:03:48,450
You know better than I, Mr. Di Vita--
the economy, TV, videos.

980
02:03:48,570 --> 02:03:52,730
The old movie business
is just a memory.

981
02:03:53,450 --> 02:03:57,450
The city bought the site
for a parking lot.

982
02:03:57,530 --> 02:04:01,210
They're demolishing it Saturday.
It's too bad.

983
02:04:03,250 --> 02:04:05,090
What's this ""Mr. Di Vita''?

984
02:04:06,170 --> 02:04:08,130
You used to order me around.

985
02:04:08,250 --> 02:04:12,970
Now that you're a big shot,
it's a little different.

986
02:04:13,010 --> 02:04:16,250
But if you insist, Toto.

987
02:04:19,370 --> 02:04:20,770
Excuse me.

988
02:04:25,810 --> 02:04:28,690
Who would've believed it?
Little Toto.

989
02:05:00,370 --> 02:05:03,850
Uncle, next time Grandma goes
to Rome, I want to go too.

990
02:05:03,930 --> 02:05:06,130
I want to see what you do
when you work.

991
02:05:06,650 --> 02:05:09,330
Fine, but I have to tell you,
there's not much to see.

992
02:05:09,770 --> 02:05:12,210
I sell a lot of smoke
and very little substance.

993
02:05:14,170 --> 02:05:15,610
Watch out, Salvatore.

994
02:05:15,770 --> 02:05:17,810
Don't let them take
advantage of you.

995
02:05:17,930 --> 02:05:21,250
These two will eat you alive.

996
02:05:23,090 --> 02:05:24,770
Uncle, are you leaving tomorrow?

997
02:05:27,210 --> 02:05:30,450
I don't know.
I don't know, Filippo.

998
02:05:31,450 --> 02:05:33,090
I really don't know.

999
02:05:51,970 --> 02:05:53,370
It must be for you.

1000
02:05:53,450 --> 02:05:55,930
They've been calling all afternoon.

1001
02:05:56,050 --> 02:05:58,250
They want to know
whether you're leaving tonight...

1002
02:05:58,650 --> 02:05:59,810
or tomorrow.

1003
02:06:09,210 --> 02:06:10,610
Go on in.

1004
02:09:10,450 --> 02:09:12,210
A double whiskey, please.

1005
02:09:15,170 --> 02:09:16,770
Do you think that's him?

1006
02:09:22,370 --> 02:09:24,930
Excuse me, are you Dr. Lenera?

1007
02:09:26,330 --> 02:09:28,130
I'm a big fan.

1008
02:09:32,770 --> 02:09:34,530
Thank you.

1009
02:10:37,010 --> 02:10:38,770
- Miss?
- Yes?

1010
02:10:46,290 --> 02:10:49,370
I'm sorry.
I mistook you for someone else.

1011
02:12:05,810 --> 02:12:07,930
I always have to call you.

1012
02:12:08,090 --> 02:12:10,010
Why right now?

1013
02:12:10,090 --> 02:12:13,450
You were supposed
to pick me up at noon.

1014
02:12:13,890 --> 02:12:16,810
Forget it. I'm not coming.

1015
02:12:16,810 --> 02:12:19,450
You know what?
I'll go by myself.

1016
02:13:05,010 --> 02:13:06,810
What are you thinking?

1017
02:13:10,530 --> 02:13:14,930
I was thinking that you and I
have never spoken, Mama.

1018
02:13:17,930 --> 02:13:21,250
When I was little,
I saw you...

1019
02:13:22,730 --> 02:13:24,730
as an old woman already.

1020
02:13:25,890 --> 02:13:28,050
Maybe it's the same for all children.
Who knows?

1021
02:13:37,810 --> 02:13:40,130
Only now do I realize...

1022
02:13:41,650 --> 02:13:43,690
that you were young...

1023
02:13:44,370 --> 02:13:46,050
and beautiful.

1024
02:13:47,170 --> 02:13:49,490
You had your whole life
ahead of you.

1025
02:13:51,330 --> 02:13:55,330
How have you managed
to live alone all this time...

1026
02:13:56,650 --> 02:13:58,930
with no one to think of you?

1027
02:14:00,330 --> 02:14:02,090
You could have remarried.

1028
02:14:03,290 --> 02:14:05,010
Why not?

1029
02:14:07,170 --> 02:14:10,250
It's possible that back then
I wouldn't have understood.

1030
02:14:11,050 --> 02:14:13,770
But eventually I would have.

1031
02:14:15,210 --> 02:14:18,370
I never had anyone,
if that's what you're thinking.

1032
02:14:19,010 --> 02:14:21,090
It was my choice not to.

1033
02:14:21,170 --> 02:14:24,330
I remained faithful
first to your father...

1034
02:14:24,370 --> 02:14:26,690
and later to you and Lia.

1035
02:14:27,530 --> 02:14:30,570
That's the way I am.
I can't help it.

1036
02:14:31,290 --> 02:14:34,130
And you're a lot like me.

1037
02:14:34,170 --> 02:14:36,570
You're far too attached
to your things.

1038
02:14:37,490 --> 02:14:40,450
I don't know
if it's a good thing.

1039
02:14:40,770 --> 02:14:44,650
Loyalty is hard.

1040
02:14:44,810 --> 02:14:47,810
If you're loyal,
you're forever alone.

1041
02:14:54,850 --> 02:14:56,450
I shouldn't have called you.

1042
02:14:58,690 --> 02:15:00,970
It's not your fault, Mama.

1043
02:15:01,250 --> 02:15:05,690
It's just that I've always been
afraid to come back.

1044
02:15:06,890 --> 02:15:11,690
And now, after all these years,
I thought I was stronger...

1045
02:15:12,650 --> 02:15:14,890
that I'd forgotten
a lot of things.

1046
02:15:15,770 --> 02:15:18,290
But in fact...

1047
02:15:19,210 --> 02:15:21,490
I find I'm right back
where I was...

1048
02:15:21,690 --> 02:15:24,250
as if I'd never been away.

1049
02:15:26,210 --> 02:15:29,010
And yet I look at Lia
and feel that I don't even know her.

1050
02:15:32,810 --> 02:15:34,770
And you, Mama...

1051
02:15:36,010 --> 02:15:37,770
I deserted you.

1052
02:15:38,930 --> 02:15:40,930
Ran out on you like a bandit...

1053
02:15:41,050 --> 02:15:43,050
without any explanation.

1054
02:15:43,130 --> 02:15:44,770
I never asked for any.

1055
02:15:44,890 --> 02:15:47,290
You don't have to explain
anything to me.

1056
02:15:47,290 --> 02:15:51,650
I always thought you did
what was right. Why dwell on it?

1057
02:15:53,170 --> 02:15:55,170
Only one thing caused me pain.

1058
02:15:55,210 --> 02:15:59,770
When I used to bolt
the door at night...

1059
02:15:59,850 --> 02:16:01,610
before going to bed--

1060
02:16:03,250 --> 02:16:05,370
You never used to do that.

1061
02:16:07,010 --> 02:16:10,290
When you worked nights
at the theater...

1062
02:16:10,410 --> 02:16:15,130
I couldn't fall asleep
until you came home.

1063
02:16:16,410 --> 02:16:19,170
When you finally came in...

1064
02:16:19,850 --> 02:16:22,170
I'd pretend to be asleep.

1065
02:16:22,410 --> 02:16:25,130
But I'd hear you
moving around the house.

1066
02:16:25,130 --> 02:16:27,690
Then, when you'd fall asleep...

1067
02:16:27,690 --> 02:16:32,010
I'd get up and bolt the door.

1068
02:16:33,810 --> 02:16:37,650
After you left...

1069
02:16:38,050 --> 02:16:40,450
every time I did it...

1070
02:16:40,610 --> 02:16:43,530
it felt as if I were leaving
someone outside the door.

1071
02:16:45,450 --> 02:16:47,050
Far away.

1072
02:16:48,290 --> 02:16:50,410
You were right to leave.

1073
02:16:50,410 --> 02:16:53,210
You did what you wanted to do.

1074
02:16:55,410 --> 02:16:59,370
Every time I call you,
a different woman answers.

1075
02:16:59,370 --> 02:17:02,210
I pretend to recognize them...

1076
02:17:02,290 --> 02:17:06,210
to save them the embarrassment
of an introduction.

1077
02:17:06,890 --> 02:17:10,730
I'm sure they must think
I'm a crazy old woman.

1078
02:17:12,850 --> 02:17:16,490
But I never heard
in any of their voices...

1079
02:17:16,570 --> 02:17:18,570
that they really loved you.

1080
02:17:18,690 --> 02:17:20,530
I would've known.

1081
02:17:20,570 --> 02:17:23,050
All the same, I'd have liked...

1082
02:17:23,050 --> 02:17:27,370
to see you settled down...

1083
02:17:27,370 --> 02:17:29,170
in love with someone.

1084
02:17:30,450 --> 02:17:32,610
But your life is there.

1085
02:17:32,650 --> 02:17:35,610
Here there are only ghosts.

1086
02:17:35,690 --> 02:17:37,330
Let go, Toto.

1087
02:18:38,810 --> 02:18:40,370
Boccia!

1088
02:18:58,530 --> 02:19:00,290
<i>Hello.</i>

1089
02:19:46,130 --> 02:19:48,050
<i>Hello. Who is it?</i>

1090
02:19:51,730 --> 02:19:54,170
I'd like to speak
to Elena, please.

1091
02:19:54,170 --> 02:19:56,210
<i>Speaking.</i>

1092
02:19:56,610 --> 02:19:58,410
<i>Who is it?</i>

1093
02:20:00,530 --> 02:20:02,290
Salvatore.

1094
02:20:04,850 --> 02:20:08,970
<i>Salvatore... who?</i>

1095
02:20:11,970 --> 02:20:15,330
Di Vita. This is Salvatore Di Vita.

1096
02:20:17,890 --> 02:20:19,450
Do you remember?

1097
02:20:20,650 --> 02:20:23,090
I'm across the street
from your house.

1098
02:20:23,490 --> 02:20:25,450
Right here, Elena.

1099
02:20:36,970 --> 02:20:38,970
<i>Of course I remember.</i>

1100
02:20:42,970 --> 02:20:45,050
I'd like to see you, Elena.

1101
02:20:45,530 --> 02:20:47,330
Let's meet.

1102
02:20:48,490 --> 02:20:50,730
<i>It was so long ago.</i>

1103
02:20:51,250 --> 02:20:53,250
<i>Why should we meet?</i>

1104
02:20:54,330 --> 02:20:56,090
<i>What good would it do?</i>

1105
02:20:56,850 --> 02:20:58,690
Please, don't say no.

1106
02:20:59,690 --> 02:21:03,010
<i>I'm old, Salvatore, and so are you.</i>

1107
02:21:03,690 --> 02:21:05,610
<i>It's better
not to see each other.</i>

1108
02:21:07,010 --> 02:21:09,130
<i>Good-bye.</i>

1109
02:23:11,690 --> 02:23:13,210
How did you know I'd be here?

1110
02:23:15,170 --> 02:23:18,770
I don't know how long it's been,
but there are things I remember.

1111
02:23:20,250 --> 02:23:22,690
There weren't many places
to choose from.

1112
02:23:25,690 --> 02:23:27,730
I looked for you.

1113
02:23:45,570 --> 02:23:47,610
You're still beautiful.

1114
02:23:50,770 --> 02:23:54,210
What are you talking about?
I'm old.

1115
02:23:59,130 --> 02:24:01,490
Please don't look at me that way.

1116
02:24:05,130 --> 02:24:07,170
Why did you come back?

1117
02:24:08,370 --> 02:24:10,290
Alfredo died.

1118
02:24:10,970 --> 02:24:12,410
Do you remember him?

1119
02:24:14,130 --> 02:24:16,050
Of course I remember him.

1120
02:24:16,690 --> 02:24:18,290
I'm sorry.

1121
02:24:20,770 --> 02:24:22,730
You loved him very much.

1122
02:24:25,530 --> 02:24:27,530
I saw your daughter.

1123
02:24:28,330 --> 02:24:30,330
She's very beautiful.

1124
02:24:32,530 --> 02:24:34,530
I bet there are many Salvatores
running after her.

1125
02:24:36,770 --> 02:24:38,090
A few.

1126
02:24:39,810 --> 02:24:42,250
But there aren't many like you.

1127
02:24:46,290 --> 02:24:49,570
I also have a son.
He's older.

1128
02:24:52,330 --> 02:24:54,850
- And you?
- No children.

1129
02:24:55,130 --> 02:24:57,050
I'm not married.

1130
02:25:00,130 --> 02:25:01,330
Are you happy?

1131
02:25:02,410 --> 02:25:03,970
All things considered, yes.

1132
02:25:06,290 --> 02:25:09,330
Although it wasn't
what I dreamt of at the time.

1133
02:25:12,010 --> 02:25:13,930
You know my husband, don't you?

1134
02:25:17,370 --> 02:25:19,290
Sure I do. Boccia.
I remember him well.

1135
02:25:21,650 --> 02:25:25,170
What does he do in life?

1136
02:25:26,570 --> 02:25:27,970
He's in politics.

1137
02:25:29,130 --> 02:25:31,010
He's a regional delegate.

1138
02:25:33,370 --> 02:25:36,330
We met up again
at the University of Pisa.

1139
02:25:38,970 --> 02:25:41,930
Why didn't you marry the man
your father had chosen?

1140
02:25:41,930 --> 02:25:43,810
I didn't want to.

1141
02:25:43,930 --> 02:25:45,450
And in the end, I won.

1142
02:25:51,210 --> 02:25:53,690
Back then I was waiting for you.

1143
02:25:59,690 --> 02:26:03,330
But I never forgot you. Ever.

1144
02:26:04,010 --> 02:26:05,850
Neither did I.

1145
02:26:07,610 --> 02:26:10,010
Even though you disappeared.

1146
02:26:13,970 --> 02:26:16,410
But why talk about it now?

1147
02:26:21,970 --> 02:26:24,770
We'll just end up looking pathetic
and ridiculous.

1148
02:26:25,770 --> 02:26:27,010
Do you still live in Rome?

1149
02:26:27,090 --> 02:26:29,010
What are you talking about?

1150
02:26:30,210 --> 02:26:33,730
The last time we spoke, we made
a date to meet at the Paradiso.

1151
02:26:33,730 --> 02:26:37,250
You never showed up!
You disappeared without a trace!

1152
02:26:37,290 --> 02:26:40,890
How many years have gone by?
More than 30!

1153
02:26:45,810 --> 02:26:49,690
I did show up for that date.

1154
02:26:58,330 --> 02:27:00,610
But I was late.

1155
02:27:02,170 --> 02:27:04,450
I had had a long fight
with my parents.

1156
02:27:07,010 --> 02:27:10,690
I had tried to convince them
that they couldn't separate us.

1157
02:27:12,730 --> 02:27:14,650
But it was no use.

1158
02:27:16,930 --> 02:27:18,690
They had decided...

1159
02:27:19,850 --> 02:27:22,810
to leave Sicily once and for all.

1160
02:27:24,970 --> 02:27:26,970
And we did.

1161
02:27:28,610 --> 02:27:32,210
I didn't know what else to do,
what else to say.

1162
02:27:34,170 --> 02:27:36,370
So I said yes.

1163
02:27:36,970 --> 02:27:39,570
I would do as they wished.

1164
02:27:41,450 --> 02:27:43,290
In exchange,
my father agreed...

1165
02:27:43,290 --> 02:27:46,370
to let me see you one last time
to say good-bye.

1166
02:27:48,290 --> 02:27:50,250
I was hoping...

1167
02:27:51,210 --> 02:27:55,690
that we would use that time
to come up with a plan.

1168
02:27:57,690 --> 02:27:59,850
I thought we would...

1169
02:28:01,450 --> 02:28:03,410
run away together.

1170
02:28:09,610 --> 02:28:11,650
My father drove me
to the theater.

1171
02:28:11,770 --> 02:28:14,650
But Alfredo was in the booth,
not you.

1172
02:28:17,690 --> 02:28:21,290
<i>I couldn't wait
for you to get back.</i>

1173
02:28:23,570 --> 02:28:25,490
Hurry up, Elena.

1174
02:28:25,610 --> 02:28:27,850
<i>So I explained
the situation to Alfredo.</i>

1175
02:28:28,370 --> 02:28:30,730
<i>I told him I was leaving
that very night.</i>

1176
02:28:30,850 --> 02:28:33,090
<i>I begged him
to tell you everything.</i>

1177
02:28:34,850 --> 02:28:37,290
<i>He was very nice to me.</i>

1178
02:28:38,810 --> 02:28:40,210
<i>He listened...</i>

1179
02:28:41,050 --> 02:28:42,850
<i>very carefully.</i>

1180
02:28:44,570 --> 02:28:46,570
Calm down.

1181
02:28:46,770 --> 02:28:48,370
Don't cry.

1182
02:28:49,690 --> 02:28:51,930
Now you listen to me.

1183
02:28:52,330 --> 02:28:55,250
If you want me to tell Toto
all that you told me...

1184
02:28:55,250 --> 02:28:57,250
I will.

1185
02:28:57,290 --> 02:28:59,890
But if you want my advice...

1186
02:28:59,890 --> 02:29:01,290
forget about him.

1187
02:29:01,890 --> 02:29:04,650
It would be better for both of you
not to see each other.

1188
02:29:05,450 --> 02:29:06,850
My child...

1189
02:29:07,290 --> 02:29:11,490
fire always turns to ashes.

1190
02:29:11,850 --> 02:29:15,330
Even the greatest love
comes to an end...

1191
02:29:15,450 --> 02:29:19,810
and many other loves come
to take its place.

1192
02:29:19,850 --> 02:29:22,490
But Toto has only one future.

1193
02:29:23,210 --> 02:29:27,090
He can't see it now. I tell him,
but he doesn't believe me.

1194
02:29:27,610 --> 02:29:29,730
He might even kill me.

1195
02:29:31,690 --> 02:29:34,930
But you can understand it.

1196
02:29:35,650 --> 02:29:37,650
<i>You must understand it.</i>

1197
02:29:38,090 --> 02:29:39,610
Do it for him.

1198
02:29:57,210 --> 02:30:00,170
It's a secret I would rather
not even have told you.

1199
02:30:08,130 --> 02:30:10,130
Damn Alfredo!

1200
02:30:12,610 --> 02:30:14,490
He fooled even you.

1201
02:30:16,890 --> 02:30:19,490
I told him
I would take his advice.

1202
02:30:19,650 --> 02:30:21,970
But before I left,
I wrote you that note.

1203
02:30:33,490 --> 02:30:35,450
I was going down the stairs...

1204
02:30:37,170 --> 02:30:40,290
<i>and I figured
that Alfredo couldn't see me.</i>

1205
02:30:42,290 --> 02:30:44,170
<i>So I went back.</i>

1206
02:30:46,330 --> 02:30:50,650
<i>He sat there motionless
at the projector.</i>

1207
02:30:51,850 --> 02:30:54,650
<i>I took one of those slips of paper
off the wall...</i>

1208
02:30:56,690 --> 02:30:59,090
<i>and wrote down the address
where you could find me...</i>

1209
02:31:01,450 --> 02:31:03,730
<i>and that I would wait for you.</i>

1210
02:31:07,610 --> 02:31:10,170
But you disappeared anyway.

1211
02:31:20,050 --> 02:31:22,730
How I looked for you, Elena!

1212
02:31:25,330 --> 02:31:27,250
You have no idea.

1213
02:31:28,850 --> 02:31:31,130
I wrote, I called. Nothing.

1214
02:31:33,290 --> 02:31:35,690
No one ever answered.

1215
02:31:39,410 --> 02:31:41,770
That's why I ran away.

1216
02:31:45,170 --> 02:31:47,370
And why I never came back here.

1217
02:31:49,810 --> 02:31:51,730
But I dreamt of you for years.

1218
02:32:03,490 --> 02:32:05,690
Even though years passed...

1219
02:32:06,650 --> 02:32:09,090
in every woman I met...

1220
02:32:09,650 --> 02:32:11,970
I sought only you.

1221
02:32:13,450 --> 02:32:17,650
I've been very lucky in my career,
it's true.

1222
02:32:21,490 --> 02:32:23,650
But something was always missing.

1223
02:32:26,970 --> 02:32:29,250
I never would have dreamt that...

1224
02:32:29,370 --> 02:32:32,130
everything would end...

1225
02:32:33,130 --> 02:32:35,850
because of the man
who was a father to me.

1226
02:32:37,450 --> 02:32:38,810
That madman.

1227
02:32:39,690 --> 02:32:43,290
He wasn't crazy. In the beginning
I think I hated him too.

1228
02:32:44,090 --> 02:32:45,930
But in time...

1229
02:32:47,050 --> 02:32:49,290
I understood his words...

1230
02:32:51,210 --> 02:32:53,450
and also your silence.

1231
02:32:55,250 --> 02:32:57,010
I never found that note.

1232
02:32:59,410 --> 02:33:01,410
I covered it up
with my own two hands.

1233
02:33:03,570 --> 02:33:07,130
I didn't see it.
It's the only absurd explanation.

1234
02:33:07,210 --> 02:33:10,010
What does it matter now
whether we find the reason?

1235
02:33:11,490 --> 02:33:13,370
What's done is done.

1236
02:33:14,650 --> 02:33:17,050
But Alfredo didn't betray you.

1237
02:33:17,130 --> 02:33:19,690
He was the only one
who truly understood you.

1238
02:33:20,730 --> 02:33:22,410
Salvatore...

1239
02:33:22,930 --> 02:33:25,890
if you had chosen to stay with me,
you wouldn't have made your movies...

1240
02:33:25,930 --> 02:33:28,090
and that would have been
a shame.

1241
02:33:28,170 --> 02:33:30,570
They're wonderful.

1242
02:33:30,690 --> 02:33:32,570
I've seen them all.

1243
02:33:34,890 --> 02:33:37,450
But you never should have changed
your name.

1244
02:33:39,050 --> 02:33:40,970
You should have kept your name.

1245
02:33:41,930 --> 02:33:43,690
Salvatore Di Vita.

1246
02:34:53,090 --> 02:34:55,850
These are the things
he left for you.

1247
02:35:10,050 --> 02:35:15,010
When they showed your films
on television...

1248
02:35:15,050 --> 02:35:16,650
he was happy.

1249
02:35:18,330 --> 02:35:22,650
He'd sit in front of it
and forget all his troubles.

1250
02:35:25,370 --> 02:35:28,890
He knew all the words by heart...

1251
02:35:28,970 --> 02:35:32,450
and I would tell him
what I saw.

1252
02:35:32,450 --> 02:35:35,090
And when the papers
talked about you...

1253
02:35:35,250 --> 02:35:37,930
I'd have to read them to him
two or three times.

1254
02:35:42,330 --> 02:35:46,570
- He never asked to see me?
- No, never.

1255
02:35:48,530 --> 02:35:51,490
Once your mother said to him...

1256
02:35:51,570 --> 02:35:54,690
that you'd surely come
if you wanted him to.

1257
02:35:56,010 --> 02:35:58,610
He was furious and said...

1258
02:35:58,690 --> 02:36:02,970
""No, Toto must never come back
to Giancaldo!''

1259
02:36:05,810 --> 02:36:08,210
He didn't say it to be mean.

1260
02:36:08,250 --> 02:36:10,250
He was a good man.

1261
02:36:11,450 --> 02:36:15,290
Who knows what was going
through his head?

1262
02:36:15,410 --> 02:36:19,330
Towards the end,
he started saying strange things.

1263
02:36:21,970 --> 02:36:25,930
A moment before
he closed his eyes...

1264
02:36:26,090 --> 02:36:30,130
he told your mother
she mustn't let you know.

1265
02:36:43,450 --> 02:36:45,930
1 977, '7 8--

1266
02:37:10,890 --> 02:37:12,810
<i>Moby Dick.</i>

1267
02:37:15,650 --> 02:37:17,610
<i>Dreams in a Drawer.</i>

1268
02:37:18,610 --> 02:37:20,210
<i>The Challenge.</i>

1269
02:37:20,970 --> 02:37:22,730
<i>The Searchers.</i>

1270
02:37:26,370 --> 02:37:28,330
<i>Magnificent Obsession.</i>

1271
02:37:30,770 --> 02:37:32,530
<i>The Cry.</i>

1272
02:37:44,290 --> 02:37:46,090
""Salvatore...

1273
02:37:47,410 --> 02:37:49,090
forgive me.

1274
02:37:50,650 --> 02:37:52,930
When I see you,
I'll explain what happened.

1275
02:37:53,890 --> 02:37:57,170
It was terrible
not to find you here.

1276
02:37:57,210 --> 02:38:02,970
I'm afraid I'll be leaving tonight
for Tuscany with my mother.

1277
02:38:04,130 --> 02:38:05,690
We're moving there.

1278
02:38:06,970 --> 02:38:10,690
But I love only you.

1279
02:38:10,730 --> 02:38:13,890
I'll never be with another man.
I swear it.

1280
02:38:15,890 --> 02:38:20,250
I'm leaving you the address
of a friend where you can write me.

1281
02:38:22,490 --> 02:38:24,450
Don't give up on me.

1282
02:38:27,010 --> 02:38:29,010
Sealed with a kiss...

1283
02:38:30,490 --> 02:38:32,610
Your Elena.''

1284
02:38:36,090 --> 02:38:38,010
<i>When are you leaving?</i>

1285
02:38:39,650 --> 02:38:41,410
This afternoon.

1286
02:38:42,730 --> 02:38:46,170
Elena, perhaps in the future
we could--

1287
02:38:46,370 --> 02:38:49,170
No, Salvatore, there is no future.

1288
02:38:49,530 --> 02:38:51,450
There is only the past.

1289
02:38:52,930 --> 02:38:55,330
Even last night's encounter
was just a dream.

1290
02:38:55,930 --> 02:38:57,930
A wonderful dream.

1291
02:39:00,090 --> 02:39:02,530
When we were young,
we never did it.

1292
02:39:03,530 --> 02:39:04,650
Do you remember?

1293
02:39:07,650 --> 02:39:11,090
<i>Now that it has happened,
I can't imagine a better ending.</i>

1294
02:39:17,730 --> 02:39:20,010
I'll never agree with you.

1295
02:39:21,130 --> 02:39:22,770
Never.

1296
02:41:01,490 --> 02:41:05,370
It's my square.
The square is mine.

1297
02:41:29,010 --> 02:41:31,770
Check the leader.
Roll when you're ready.

1298
02:41:31,770 --> 02:41:35,610
- I liked your film. It was terrific.
- Thanks.

1299
02:41:36,970 --> 02:41:40,210
The distributor is moving up
the release date.

1300
02:41:40,450 --> 02:41:42,650
The press conference
is this afternoon.

1301
02:41:42,650 --> 02:41:45,250
The actors will be there,
as well as the producer.

1302
02:41:45,250 --> 02:41:47,370
We just got official confirmation
of the award...

1303
02:41:47,410 --> 02:41:49,810
but we've already received
loads of telegrams.

1304
02:41:50,770 --> 02:41:52,610
Aren't you happy?

1305
02:41:53,410 --> 02:41:56,130
Sure, fine.
We can discuss it later.
