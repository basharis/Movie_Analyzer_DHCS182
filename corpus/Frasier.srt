1
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:05,515
<i>- Who's our first caller?
- Rita on line four.</i>

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,433
<i>She's feeling overwhelmed at home.</i>

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,875
<i>Hello, Rita. l'm listening.</i>

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:16,239
<i>Dr Crane, thank you for taking my call.</i>

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,197
<i>l tell you, l...</i>

6
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,156
<i>l am about to lose my mind.</i>

7
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:25,677
<i>l am raising four kids by myself.
The oldest one isn't even seven.</i>

8
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,400
<i>The other three are all under five.</i>

9
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,916
<i>Between cooking, cleaning
and changing diapers...</i>

10
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,036
<i>tripping over toys...</i>

11
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,749
<i>l feel sometimes like l'm about to snap.</i>

12
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,911
<i>What should l do?</i>

13
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,594
<i>Have you considered getting a puppy?</i>

14
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,029
<i>lt's not that l don't like him,
but he's gotten so attached.</i>

15
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,795
<i>l mean, roses every day
after two dates!</i>

16
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,076
<i>Maggie, first thing you have to do</i>

17
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:04,119
<i>is sit Gavin down
for a nice long conversation.</i>

18
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:10,159
<i>Tell him frankly that,
though he wants to go at one speed,</i>

19
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,959
<i>you need to go at another.</i>

20
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:18,797
<i>Tell him you're not rejecting him,
you are fond of him, but...</i>

21
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,273
<i>l wonder what Roz, my
non-PhD-holding producer, thinks.</i>

22
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,640
<i>Any guy who's that clingy after two
dates has a major insecurity problem.</i>

23
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,951
<i>l say, ''Dump him. Now.
And don't look back. ''</i>

24
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,588
<i>lt's so good to hear that, Roz.</i>

25
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:42,713
<i>That's what l wanted to do, but l felt
so guilty. Thanks so much. Bye.</i>

26
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,191
<i>That takes us to commercial.</i>

27
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:57,357
<i>Edna, on line two, is a receptionist at
a pest control firm. She's depressed.</i>

28
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,988
<i>Hello, Edna. l'm listening.</i>

29
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:04,392
<i>Hello, Dr Crane. l've been working
in pest control for 1 5 years.</i>

30
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:10,112
<i>l go in every day, answer the same
calls, ask the same questions.</i>

31
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,875
<i>''What kind of bugs?
Have you seen any droppings?''</i>

32
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:18,192
<i>Then l go to the next person.
''What kind of bugs?''</i>

33
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,750
<i>Edna, l can sense where this is going.</i>

34
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,435
<i>Even the most interesting life
can become routine.</i>

35
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,591
<i>You need to shake up your world.</i>

36
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,355
<i>Find a new boyfriend,
a new job, a new city.</i>

37
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,556
<i>- You mean move?
- Well...</i>

38
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:39,716
<i>There are easier places to cheer up
than this dreary, soggy city of ours.</i>

39
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:43,759
<i>Dr Crane, you're right.
l don't have to stay here.</i>

40
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,471
<i>When you think about it, there's
a whole world of vermin out there.</i>

41
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,279
<i>Eloquently put, Edna. Thank you.</i>

42
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:56,714
<i>Speaking of vermin...
''When that special rat of yours</i>

43
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,435
<i>''turns its toes up for the last time,</i>

44
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,956
<i>''don't forget your friends
at Pet Paradise.</i>

45
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:08,318
<i>''Pet Paradise.
When a shoebox isn't enough. ''</i>

46
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,433
<i>How can you say Seattle
is depressing?</i>

47
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:22,037
<i>l've spent 40 years here, working the
graveyard shift at a salmon cannery.</i>

48
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,192
<i>And, let me tell you,
you fatheaded moron,</i>

49
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,875
<i>l'm the most cheerful person
you'll ever meet.</i>

50
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:33,475
<i>Certainly the most cheerful one
l've met today.</i>
