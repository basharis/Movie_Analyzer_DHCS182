1
00:02:27,898 --> 00:02:29,106
What's your name again?

2
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:30,399
Chrissie.

3
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,318
Where are we going?

4
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:33,486
Swimming.

5
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:39,575
Slow up. Slow down.

6
00:02:40,077 --> 00:02:43,287
I'm not drunk! Slow down!

7
00:02:44,957 --> 00:02:46,666
Wait. I'm coming.

8
00:02:48,085 --> 00:02:49,460
I'm coming.

9
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:52,505
I'm definitely coming.

10
00:02:52,631 --> 00:02:53,673
Whoa.

11
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:55,299
Hold on. Whoa!

12
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:06,269
I can swim.

13
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:09,814
I just can't walk
or undress myself.

14
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:31,878
Come on in the water!

15
00:03:31,962 --> 00:03:33,796
Take it easy.

16
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:12,877
Oh, God, help!

17
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,053
Please help me!

18
00:04:22,346 --> 00:04:24,180
I'm coming.

19
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:27,767
It hurts!

20
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,515
<i>...local fishing reported good.</i>

21
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:09,684
<i>Amity Boat Rental Yard's
opening early</i>

22
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:11,852
<i>to prepare for the
annual seasonal rush.</i>

23
00:05:11,937 --> 00:05:13,604
<i>This is WISS...</i>

24
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:20,903
How come the sun
didn't use to shine in here?

25
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:27,284
We bought the house in the fall,
and this is summer.

26
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:33,666
Somebody feed the dogs.

27
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:34,959
Right.

28
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:41,340
Do you see the kids?

29
00:05:47,431 --> 00:05:49,432
They must be in the back yard.

30
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:51,517
In Amity you say "yard."

31
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:56,981
They're in the "yard,"
not too "far" from the "car."

32
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:01,027
How's that?

33
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:02,278
Like you're from New York.

34
00:06:04,156 --> 00:06:07,450
Mum, I got cut.
I got hit by a vampire.

35
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:09,701
You were playing on those swings,
weren't you?

36
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,037
Those swings are dangerous.

37
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:12,705
Stay off there.
I haven't fixed them yet.

38
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:15,499
I think you're going to live.

39
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:18,210
- It's not the prettiest thing I've ever seen.
- Hello.

40
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:20,087
- Yes.
- Can I go swimming?

41
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:22,465
Yeah, but let me clean
this thing off first.

42
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:25,718
What do they usually do?
Wash up, or float up, or what?

43
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:29,180
Oh, no.

44
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:33,184
Keep them there.
I'll be out in about

45
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:36,562
15, 20 minutes. All right?

46
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,147
- Dry you off.
- Okay.

47
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:39,899
Go on, get a Band-Aid.

48
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:42,568
Got to go. Missing person.

49
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:45,863
Season hasn't started.
Nobody's even here yet.

50
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:50,910
Listen, Chief...

51
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:52,703
be careful, will you?

52
00:06:52,788 --> 00:06:53,829
In this town?

53
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:55,498
Hi, Dad.

54
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:57,374
Wait a minute.
Let me get on.

55
00:06:57,709 --> 00:06:59,126
I want my cup back!

56
00:06:59,211 --> 00:07:00,419
You'll get it.

57
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:03,923
Wave goodbye. Bye.

58
00:07:34,538 --> 00:07:36,413
Nobody saw her go into the water?

59
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:39,959
Somebody could've.
I was sort of passed out.

60
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:42,169
You mean, she ran out on you?

61
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:43,379
No, sir.

62
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:47,550
She must've drowned.

63
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:50,719
Look, I reported it to you,
didn't I?

64
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:51,929
You live here?

65
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:53,097
No. Hartford.

66
00:07:53,557 --> 00:07:56,016
I go to Trinity.
My folks live in Greenwich.

67
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:57,351
Your folks were born here, right?

68
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:58,894
Yeah, I'm an Islander.

69
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,980
They moved off when my dad retired.

70
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:02,064
You an Islander?

71
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:03,232
No. New York City.

72
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:05,860
You here for the summer?
Come on.

73
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:20,749
Hold it.

74
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:34,763
Oh, Jesus.

75
00:08:59,623 --> 00:09:03,584
Well, you're up awful early.
Is the Chief in there?

76
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:07,922
Chief, what have you got on?

77
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:09,924
If this new filing system is to work,

78
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:11,926
you must keep outdated stuff
off my desk.

79
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:14,011
- Just the pending, all right?
- Yes, Chief.

80
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:16,847
We got a bunch of calls
about that karate school.

81
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:19,808
It seems that the 9-year-olds
from the school have been

82
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:22,311
karate-ing the picket fences.

83
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:27,024
Chief Brody's office.
The medical inspector.

84
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:41,872
The Fire Chief wants you
to go over the Fourth of July...

85
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:44,166
Polly, I want a list
of the water activities

86
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:46,418
that the city fathers
are planning for today.

87
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:47,878
- Right away.
- Hendricks!

88
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:50,172
Where do we keep
the "Beach Closed" signs?

89
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:51,507
- We never had any.
- No?

90
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:55,010
There's a dead truck with New Hampshire plates
in front of my store.

91
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:59,682
Just have him fill out the form.
Just fill it out.

92
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:24,832
Look what the kids did to my fence.
8 and 9-year-olds...

93
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:26,625
- Glasses?
- Yeah, glasses.

94
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:30,587
I'll call you later in the afternoon.
I promise.

95
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:38,512
This stuff ain't going
to help me in August.

96
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:40,973
The summer ginks
come down here in June.

97
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:43,934
You haven't got one thing on
here I ordered.

98
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:48,272
Not a beach umbrella,
not a sun lounger, no beach balls.

99
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:50,274
If I can't get service...

100
00:10:57,324 --> 00:10:59,992
Chief, Polly sent me to tell you

101
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:02,077
that there's a bunch of Boy Scouts
out in Avril Bay

102
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:04,121
doing the mile swim
for their merit badges.

103
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:06,665
I couldn't call them in,
there's no phones out there.

104
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,459
Okay. Come on,
get out of there.

105
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:10,085
Take this stuff
back to the office

106
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:11,712
and get to work on those signs.

107
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:15,174
"Beaches Closed. No Swimming.
By order of the Amity P.D."

108
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:16,800
Let Polly do the printing.

109
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:17,968
What's the matter with my printing?

110
00:11:18,053 --> 00:11:20,387
Let Polly do the printing.

111
00:11:20,472 --> 00:11:21,889
Chief Brody!

112
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:26,727
What have you got there?

113
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:28,312
Listen, we had a shark attack

114
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:30,022
at South Beach this morning, Mayor.

115
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:31,732
Fatal. I have to batten down the beach.

116
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,444
Albert, come on, you kook.
Keep your arms up.

117
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:44,828
Charlie, take me out to those kids,
will you?

118
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:11,605
Martin, you're going to shut down the beaches
on your own authority?

119
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:13,399
What other authority do I need?

120
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:14,900
Technically, you need a civic ordinance

121
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:16,485
or a resolution by a board of...

122
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:17,986
That's just going by the book.

123
00:12:18,113 --> 00:12:19,405
We're really a little anxious

124
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:22,241
that you're rushing
into something serious here.

125
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:24,368
This is your first summer, you know.

126
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:26,161
What does that mean?

127
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:30,207
I'm only trying to say that Amity
is a summer town.

128
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,835
We need summer dollars.

129
00:12:33,044 --> 00:12:34,461
If they can't swim here

130
00:12:34,546 --> 00:12:36,380
they'll be glad to swim
at the beaches

131
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:38,715
of Cape Cod, the Hamptons,
Long Island.

132
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:41,135
That doesn't mean we serve them
a smorgasbord.

133
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:44,638
But we've never had that kind of trouble
in these waters.

134
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:46,557
What else could've done that
to that girl?

135
00:12:46,641 --> 00:12:47,724
A boat propeller?

136
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:51,061
I think possibly, yes,
a boating accident.

137
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:52,729
That's not what you told me
on the phone.

138
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:54,273
I was wrong.

139
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:56,275
We'll have to amend our reports.

140
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:57,359
And you'll stand by that?

141
00:12:57,444 --> 00:12:59,069
I'll stand by that.

142
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:03,866
Martin, a summer girl goes swimming,
swims out a little far.

143
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:06,493
She tires,
fishing boat comes along...

144
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:07,703
It's happened before.

145
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:10,247
I don't think you appreciate
the gut reaction

146
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:11,498
people have to these things.

147
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:14,543
Larry, I appreciate it.
I'm just reacting to what I was told.

148
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:17,171
Martin, it's all psychological.

149
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:21,550
You yell, "Barracuda!"
And everybody says, "Huh? What?"

150
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:25,387
You yell, "Shark!"...

151
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:29,683
we've got a panic on our hands
on the Fourth of July.

152
00:13:31,686 --> 00:13:33,896
Okay. You can take us back now.

153
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:45,532
Here's mommy, here.

154
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:49,328
I'm going to get my raft
and go back out in the water.

155
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:51,413
Let me see your fingers.

156
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:54,416
Alex Kintner,
they're beginning to prune.

157
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:56,418
Just let me go out a little longer.

158
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:57,669
Just 10 more minutes.

159
00:13:57,754 --> 00:13:58,879
Thanks.

160
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,591
There are no Islanders.

161
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:03,842
None of them are from the island.

162
00:14:03,927 --> 00:14:04,968
It's just a big bother.

163
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:06,011
They're bringing in...

164
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:07,346
All I want to know...

165
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:09,473
I just want to know
one simple thing.

166
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:11,099
When do I get to become an Islander?

167
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:13,310
Ellen, never.

168
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,854
You're not born here,
you're not an Islander. That's it.

169
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:51,306
<i>Nantucket Ferries...</i>

170
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:53,892
<i>to Amity, Martha's Vineyard
and Nantucket islands.</i>

171
00:14:53,977 --> 00:14:57,396
<i>Monday to Thursday,
8:40, 1:15, 5:45 and 6:00 p.m.</i>

172
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,148
<i>Starting July 1, 8:30 p.m...</i>

173
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:05,237
Come back here.

174
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:16,790
- But don't bother him. Come right back.
- Okay. I won't.

175
00:15:19,002 --> 00:15:21,753
Martin, I know you got
a lot of problems downtown

176
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:24,923
but I've got problems at the house
I wish you'd take care of.

177
00:15:25,008 --> 00:15:26,592
One, I've got some cats parking

178
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:27,759
in front of the house,
I can't get...

179
00:15:29,012 --> 00:15:32,472
And that garbage truck next to the office,
that's terrible.

180
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:36,184
What I need is a red zone.
It's a simple thing you can take care of.

181
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:39,313
- You've done it before.
- Come here a minute, please.

182
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:44,109
Are you okay?

183
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:46,278
Yeah, I'm fine.

184
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:49,364
Listen, if the kids going in the water
is worrying you

185
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:52,492
they can play out here on the beach.

186
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,536
It's all right.
Let them go.

187
00:16:04,172 --> 00:16:05,339
It's cold.

188
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:09,301
We know all about you, Chief.

189
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:11,511
You don't go in the water
at all, do you?

190
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,056
That's some bad hat, Harry.

191
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,855
Chief Brody, you are uptight.

192
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:26,234
Come on. That's it.

193
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,329
<i>Oh, do you know the muffin man</i>

194
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:38,664
<i>The muffin man</i>

195
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,166
Tippet!

196
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,031
Did you see that?

197
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:22,708
Blood!

198
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:29,047
Everybody out!

199
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:33,802
Get them out!

200
00:17:40,143 --> 00:17:42,477
Michael, get out of the water!

201
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:56,491
Alex?

202
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:18,263
We don't even know
if there's a shark around here.

203
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:21,016
I can't argue with you.
I can't talk to you.

204
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:23,477
I have to talk to Mrs. Kintner.

205
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:25,270
Because this is turning into a contest.

206
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:29,149
It's not just the Gazette.
She's advertising in out-of-town papers.

207
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:33,361
I suggest we move back to council chambers
where we'll have more room.

208
00:18:33,488 --> 00:18:35,447
I'm responsible for public safety here.

209
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:38,533
Then go out tomorrow
and see that no one gets hurt.

210
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:41,369
It's a small story.
I'll bury it as deep as I can.

211
00:18:41,496 --> 00:18:44,206
The ad will run on the back
along with the grocery ads.

212
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,209
Right in here, please.

213
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:50,504
Move on in, please.

214
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:06,645
Why do you insist
on playing the heavy?

215
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:10,857
I have a point of view and I think
it speaks for many of the people here.

216
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:17,489
Not only me, because I have the motel.
How do you feel about it?

217
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:19,366
Let's have some order.

218
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:23,370
Let's have order, please.

219
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:26,081
Any special questions?

220
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:30,669
Is that $3,000 bounty on the shark
in cash or check?

221
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,463
I don't think that's funny.

222
00:19:33,548 --> 00:19:35,757
I don't think that's funny at all.

223
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:37,259
All right.

224
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:41,680
That's private business
between you fishermen and Mrs. Kintner.

225
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:46,226
Martin, would you please...

226
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:48,353
Chief Brody.

227
00:19:50,106 --> 00:19:53,525
I just want to tell you
what we're planning so far.

228
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:55,360
What about the beaches, Chief?

229
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:59,531
We're going to put on the extra
summer deputies as soon as possible.

230
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:02,951
And then we're going to try
and use shark spotters on the beach.

231
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:05,412
Are you going to close the beaches?

232
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:10,292
Yes, we are.

233
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:15,046
We also plan to bring in experts

234
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:17,632
from the Oceanographic Institute
on the mainland.

235
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:20,594
Only 24 hours.

236
00:20:20,678 --> 00:20:21,761
I didn't agree to that.

237
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:25,390
Only 24 hours.

238
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:28,768
Twenty-four hours
is like three weeks!

239
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:55,962
You all know me.
Know how I earn a living.

240
00:20:57,298 --> 00:20:58,924
I'll catch this bird for you.

241
00:20:59,008 --> 00:21:01,343
It ain't going to be easy.
Bad fish.

242
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:03,678
Not like going down to the pond

243
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:06,181
and chasing bluegills or tommy cods.

244
00:21:07,642 --> 00:21:10,143
This shark, swallow you whole.

245
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:15,690
Shaking, tenderizing.
Down you go.

246
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:18,109
And we got to do it quick.

247
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:19,527
Got to bring back the tourists

248
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:22,697
that'll put all your businesses
on a paying basis.

249
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:25,784
But it's not going to be pleasant.

250
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:29,037
I value my neck
a lot more than $3,000, Chief.

251
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:34,376
I'll find him for $3,000,
but I'll catch him and kill him for $10,000.

252
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:37,003
You got to make up your minds.

253
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:39,547
Gonna stay alive and ante up,

254
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:43,218
gonna play it cheap
and be on welfare the whole winter.

255
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,055
I don't want no volunteers.
I don't want no mates.

256
00:21:47,181 --> 00:21:50,058
There's too many captains
on this island.

257
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,894
$10,000 for me, by myself.

258
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:58,400
For that, you get the head, the tail,
the whole damn thing.

259
00:22:02,363 --> 00:22:04,739
Thank you very much, Mr. Quint.

260
00:22:06,075 --> 00:22:08,910
We'll take it under advisement.

261
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:14,457
Mr. Mayor, Chief,

262
00:22:16,627 --> 00:22:18,545
ladies and gentlemen.

263
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:54,497
Oh, God, you scared me.

264
00:22:58,294 --> 00:23:02,047
You know, Ellen, people don't even know
how old sharks are.

265
00:23:02,131 --> 00:23:05,300
I mean, if they live 2,000, 3,000 years...
They don't know.

266
00:23:05,426 --> 00:23:07,594
Enough.

267
00:23:07,678 --> 00:23:09,471
You're not going to even be able
to go to sleep tonight.

268
00:23:09,597 --> 00:23:11,806
Here. Come on.

269
00:23:13,017 --> 00:23:14,309
Thanks.

270
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:25,320
Want to get drunk
and fool around?

271
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:26,654
Oh, yeah.

272
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:33,286
Mikey really loves his present.

273
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:36,122
Where is he?

274
00:23:36,207 --> 00:23:37,332
Sitting in it.

275
00:23:40,503 --> 00:23:41,836
Good God.

276
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:47,967
All right, Michael,
out of the boat!

277
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:52,180
Tied up to the jetties,
sitting in the boat.

278
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:53,723
I'm helping Michael.

279
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:55,433
Get out of that boat!

280
00:23:55,518 --> 00:23:58,186
Hi, Dad.
Just a little longer. Please?

281
00:23:58,312 --> 00:23:59,771
It's his birthday.

282
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:00,855
I don't want him on the ocean!

283
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:02,732
He's not on the ocean,
he is in a boat.

284
00:24:02,817 --> 00:24:04,192
He won't go in the water.

285
00:24:04,318 --> 00:24:08,696
I don't think he'll go in the water again,
after what happened yesterday.

286
00:24:10,074 --> 00:24:12,408
All right, now don't say that.

287
00:24:12,743 --> 00:24:15,745
I don't want that to happen,
you know that.

288
00:24:17,206 --> 00:24:19,124
I want him to read
the boating regulations,

289
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:22,377
the rules, before he goes out
on his own.

290
00:24:22,545 --> 00:24:26,840
Michael, did you hear your father?
Out of the water now!

291
00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:28,216
Now!

292
00:24:35,099 --> 00:24:38,059
I'm tired.
Let's stop before someone reports us.

293
00:24:39,353 --> 00:24:43,022
Don't worry. The Chief lives
on the other side of the island.

294
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:45,400
Am I coming in straight?

295
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:47,068
Don't worry about it.
Just keep rowing.

296
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:57,162
We better catch something,

297
00:24:57,246 --> 00:24:59,414
this is my wife's holiday roast.

298
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:01,207
Don't worry about it.

299
00:25:01,292 --> 00:25:03,293
$3,000 buys an awful lot of roast.

300
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:14,429
Come and get it.

301
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:19,976
The tide's taking it right out.

302
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:24,272
Can't we go home?

303
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,168
He's taking it.

304
00:26:28,337 --> 00:26:29,921
Go!

305
00:26:59,952 --> 00:27:02,328
Charlie, take my word for it,
don't look back!

306
00:27:02,413 --> 00:27:04,038
Swim, Charlie!

307
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:10,169
Come on! To me, boy!
Come on, Charlie! Swim!

308
00:27:10,254 --> 00:27:12,422
Come on, Charlie, keep coming.
Keep swimming.

309
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:14,716
Come on, a little more.
Atta boy.

310
00:27:16,385 --> 00:27:18,011
I can't get up.

311
00:27:18,095 --> 00:27:19,721
Give me your hand, Charlie.

312
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:22,807
Help me!

313
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:24,976
Get your feet out of the water!

314
00:27:38,282 --> 00:27:40,074
Can we go home now?

315
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:52,837
So then Denherder and Charlie sat there
trying to catch their breath

316
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:55,173
and figure out
how to tell Charlie's wife

317
00:27:55,257 --> 00:27:57,216
what happened to her freezer
full of meat.

318
00:27:57,301 --> 00:27:59,969
That's not funny.
That's not funny at all.

319
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:02,722
Mrs. Kintner must've put her ad
in <i>Field & Stream.</i>

320
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:05,099
Looks more like
<i>The National Enquirer.</i>

321
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:10,480
All right, hold it. Hold everything.
I said, hold it!

322
00:28:16,779 --> 00:28:17,737
Hello.

323
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:20,281
Hello back, young fellow.
How are you?

324
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:24,452
Say, I hope you're not going out
with those nuts, are you?

325
00:28:28,624 --> 00:28:30,583
The Weetock boats
gotta move out first.

326
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:33,544
You have to move out
or he can't get out at all.

327
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:36,923
Don't raise sail, you're going to luff it.
You got a paddle?

328
00:28:37,007 --> 00:28:38,758
- I got a paddle.
- Scull it out of here.

329
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:41,386
Officer, wait a second.

330
00:28:43,472 --> 00:28:45,890
How many guys are you going
to put aboard that boat?

331
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:47,392
Whatever's safe, right?

332
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:48,726
Yeah, well that ain't safe.

333
00:28:48,811 --> 00:28:50,812
Watch it, that's dynamite.

334
00:28:50,896 --> 00:28:52,355
What are you doing with that?

335
00:28:52,481 --> 00:28:53,481
Where are you going with that?

336
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:55,316
I'm going on the boat.

337
00:28:55,401 --> 00:28:58,152
Please, help me get those guys
out of the boat, will you?

338
00:28:58,237 --> 00:28:59,529
- Sure.
- Come on.

339
00:28:59,822 --> 00:29:03,241
Gentlemen, the officer asked me
to tell you

340
00:29:03,325 --> 00:29:04,575
that you're overloading that boat!

341
00:29:05,494 --> 00:29:07,078
Go on, get out of here.

342
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:08,788
You ain't going.
What do you care?

343
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:12,750
Can you tell me if there's
a good restaurant or hotel on the island?

344
00:29:12,835 --> 00:29:14,085
Yeah, you walk straight ahead.

345
00:29:15,838 --> 00:29:17,922
They're all going to die.

346
00:29:18,507 --> 00:29:21,592
Listen to me.
We've got some road block signs outside.

347
00:29:21,677 --> 00:29:23,845
You've got to get somebody to help us.

348
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:26,806
Yeah, get those road block signs
out on the highway.

349
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:30,184
Because we've got more people down here
than we can handle.

350
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:33,438
What're you doing there?
These are your people. Go talk to them.

351
00:29:33,522 --> 00:29:35,440
They aren't my people.
They're from all over.

352
00:29:35,524 --> 00:29:37,400
You see all the license plates?

353
00:29:37,526 --> 00:29:40,903
Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Jersey.
I'm all by myself out there.

354
00:29:40,988 --> 00:29:42,488
What happened to the extra help...

355
00:29:42,573 --> 00:29:43,990
It's not until the Fourth of July.

356
00:29:44,074 --> 00:29:45,575
Till then, it's you and me.

357
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:47,952
You know those guys
in the fan-tail launch?

358
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:50,371
None of them are getting out
of the harbor alive.

359
00:29:50,456 --> 00:29:51,956
That's what I'm saying.

360
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,125
You know their names.
Talk to those clowns.

361
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:55,668
Everyone's having a good time today.

362
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:56,878
Tell me about it.

363
00:29:56,962 --> 00:29:58,171
Polly, I'll get back to you.

364
00:29:58,255 --> 00:30:00,923
Could you tell me
how I could find Chief Brody?

365
00:30:01,008 --> 00:30:02,049
Who are you?

366
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:05,094
Matt Hooper. I'm from
the Oceanographic Institute.

367
00:30:05,429 --> 00:30:08,723
Oh, for Christ's sakes.
You're the guy we called. I'm Brody.

368
00:30:08,849 --> 00:30:10,850
- Oh. I'm glad to meet you.
- Me, too.

369
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:12,727
I know you got a lot on your hands.

370
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:13,936
What can we do for you?

371
00:30:14,021 --> 00:30:16,814
The best thing to do
is to see the remains

372
00:30:16,899 --> 00:30:18,441
of the first victim,
the girl on the beach.

373
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:20,151
Okay, fine.
Just bear with me, will you?

374
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:21,360
Sure.

375
00:30:22,863 --> 00:30:25,865
Wait till we get them silly bastards
down in that rock pile.

376
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:27,325
There'll be some fun.

377
00:30:27,409 --> 00:30:29,744
They'll wish their fathers
hadn't met their mothers

378
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:31,579
when they start digging
the bottoms out

379
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:33,831
and slamming into them rocks, boy.

380
00:30:33,916 --> 00:30:37,001
Get away from there,
you goddamn fool!

381
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:38,252
What's the matter with you?

382
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:41,088
You want to swamp us,
you crazy son of a bitch?

383
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:43,925
What are these guys
doing out here?

384
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:46,302
What are they doing back there?

385
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:47,845
They're chumming right now.

386
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:49,055
What the hell is that?

387
00:30:49,139 --> 00:30:50,640
They're tracking the shark.

388
00:30:50,766 --> 00:30:53,684
$3,000 divided four ways is what?

389
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:57,355
Watch your starboard. Jesus!

390
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:05,196
Let's show Mr. Hooper our accident.

391
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:11,452
"Victim identified as Christine Watkins,
female Caucasian."

392
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:12,828
And here's the way we have it.

393
00:31:12,913 --> 00:31:15,498
"Probable boating accident."

394
00:31:21,338 --> 00:31:23,047
The height and weight of the victim

395
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:26,175
can only be estimated
from the partial remains.

396
00:31:31,181 --> 00:31:33,641
The torso has been severed in mid-thorax.

397
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:35,226
There are no major organs remaining.

398
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,894
May I have a glass of water?

399
00:31:36,979 --> 00:31:38,187
The right arm has been severed

400
00:31:38,272 --> 00:31:41,691
above the elbow
with massive tissue loss

401
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:43,818
in the upper musculature.

402
00:31:44,486 --> 00:31:46,070
Thank you very much.

403
00:31:48,657 --> 00:31:51,826
Partially denuded bone remaining.
This was no boat accident.

404
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,953
Did you notify
the Coast Guard about this?

405
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:56,831
No. It was only local jurisdiction.

406
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:03,629
The left arm, head,
the shoulders, sternum

407
00:32:03,714 --> 00:32:05,131
and portions of the rib cage
are intact.

408
00:32:05,215 --> 00:32:07,842
Do not smoke in here.
Thank you very much.

409
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:11,262
This is what happens.

410
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:15,516
Indicates the non-frenzy feeding
of a large <i>squalus</i>

411
00:32:15,601 --> 00:32:19,520
possibly <i>longimanus</i> or <i>Isurus glaucus.</i>

412
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:24,275
The enormous amount of tissue loss
prevents any detailed analysis

413
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:27,862
however, the attacking <i>squalus</i>
must be considerably larger

414
00:32:28,071 --> 00:32:30,448
than any normal <i>squalus</i>
found in these waters.

415
00:32:30,532 --> 00:32:32,825
Didn't you get out a boat
and check these waters?

416
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:33,951
No.

417
00:32:34,036 --> 00:32:35,703
Well, this is not a boat accident.

418
00:32:36,038 --> 00:32:39,582
And it wasn't any propeller.
It wasn't any coral reef.

419
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,959
And it wasn't Jack the Ripper.

420
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:46,380
It was a shark.

421
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:06,525
I wanna go AP and UPI.
I want to get on the state wire services.

422
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:08,653
See if Boston will pick it up
and go national.

423
00:33:08,737 --> 00:33:10,029
Call Dave Axelrod in New York

424
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:11,864
and tell him he owes me a favor.

425
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:14,825
This is the shot I want with everybody
and the fish in it.

426
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:17,161
Guys, could we please get organized?

427
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:19,497
I want to get a picture for the paper.

428
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:20,706
Now, can we just have the...

429
00:33:20,791 --> 00:33:22,333
Ben Gardner get this?

430
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:24,085
No, we caught it.

431
00:33:27,089 --> 00:33:28,172
That's swell.

432
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:29,590
It's a beauty.

433
00:33:30,801 --> 00:33:33,052
Guys, please,
I need a picture for the paper.

434
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:34,553
Clear out of the way, please.

435
00:33:34,638 --> 00:33:37,556
Just the guys that caught the fish.
Open it up a little bit.

436
00:33:37,641 --> 00:33:40,059
I want to get a picture
of the guy with the fish.

437
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:42,853
Come on.
I need a picture for the paper.

438
00:33:42,938 --> 00:33:44,146
Could we get the sign, please?

439
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:50,528
Kneel down, just like in high school.

440
00:33:50,612 --> 00:33:52,571
One row kneeling, one row standing.

441
00:33:52,656 --> 00:33:54,407
Come on, just get out of the way.

442
00:33:54,491 --> 00:33:56,784
Young fellow, could you step out
of the picture?

443
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:58,619
Take your rake with you.

444
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:01,789
- We're ready.
- Thank you.

445
00:34:02,791 --> 00:34:03,999
Can you get that, please.

446
00:34:04,084 --> 00:34:05,292
How's that?

447
00:34:11,967 --> 00:34:13,718
Larry, you won't believe it.

448
00:34:13,802 --> 00:34:15,219
What kind of a shark is that?

449
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:16,470
I don't know.

450
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,139
I think it's a mako.

451
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:19,473
It's got a deep throat, Frank.

452
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:21,600
Yeah, but what kind?
What kind of shark?

453
00:34:21,685 --> 00:34:22,810
Tiger shark.

454
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:25,855
A what?

455
00:34:25,981 --> 00:34:27,440
We can start breathing again.

456
00:34:27,524 --> 00:34:28,733
Is Ben getting plenty of pictures?

457
00:34:28,817 --> 00:34:30,025
Oh, you bet he is.

458
00:34:30,152 --> 00:34:31,736
What is this bite radius crap?

459
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:33,195
That is a big mouth.

460
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:35,239
You stuff your frigging head
in there, man,

461
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:38,325
and find out if it's a man-eater.

462
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:44,832
All I'm saying is
that it may not be the shark.

463
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:46,083
It's just a slight...

464
00:34:46,168 --> 00:34:49,628
I want you to meet Matt.
This is Larry Vaughn, our mayor.

465
00:34:49,713 --> 00:34:51,589
Matt's from the Oceanographic Institute.

466
00:34:51,673 --> 00:34:52,631
Nice to meet you.

467
00:34:52,716 --> 00:34:54,341
Terrific, huh, Mayor?

468
00:34:55,886 --> 00:34:58,721
There are all kinds of sharks
in the waters.

469
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:01,015
Hammerheads, white tips, blues, makos.

470
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:04,101
And the chances that these bozos
got the exact shark...

471
00:35:04,186 --> 00:35:06,103
There are no other sharks
like this here.

472
00:35:06,188 --> 00:35:08,105
It's 100-to-1.

473
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:12,818
I'm not saying that this is not the shark.
It probably is, Martin.

474
00:35:12,903 --> 00:35:15,738
It's a man-eater.
It's extremely rare for these waters.

475
00:35:15,864 --> 00:35:18,365
But the fact is,
the bite radius on this animal

476
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:20,910
is different than the wounds
on the victim.

477
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:25,080
I want to be sure.
You want to be sure.

478
00:35:25,165 --> 00:35:26,707
We all want to be sure, okay?

479
00:35:26,792 --> 00:35:28,417
What I want to do is very simple.

480
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:31,295
The digestive system of this animal
is very slow.

481
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:32,505
Let's cut it open.

482
00:35:32,589 --> 00:35:34,507
Whatever it's eaten
in the last 24 hours

483
00:35:34,591 --> 00:35:36,050
is bound to still be in there.

484
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:38,093
And then we'll be sure.

485
00:35:43,892 --> 00:35:46,143
It may be the only way to confirm it.

486
00:35:46,228 --> 00:35:48,562
Look, fellows, let's be reasonable.

487
00:35:49,064 --> 00:35:51,273
This is not the time or the place

488
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:54,944
to perform some kind
of a half-assed autopsy on a fish.

489
00:35:55,821 --> 00:35:59,532
And I am not going to stand here
and see that thing cut open

490
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:03,494
and see that little Kintner boy
spill out all over the dock.

491
00:36:17,759 --> 00:36:18,759
Chief Brody?

492
00:36:18,844 --> 00:36:19,844
Yes?

493
00:36:27,853 --> 00:36:29,645
I just found out

494
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:33,941
that a girl got killed here last week.

495
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,986
And you knew it.

496
00:36:37,946 --> 00:36:40,656
You knew there was a shark out there.

497
00:36:42,784 --> 00:36:44,618
You knew it was dangerous.

498
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:47,621
But you let people
go swimming anyway.

499
00:36:52,002 --> 00:36:54,295
You knew all those things,

500
00:36:57,799 --> 00:37:00,050
but still my boy is dead now.

501
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:07,308
And there's nothing
you can do about it.

502
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:14,565
My boy is dead.

503
00:37:20,155 --> 00:37:22,323
I wanted you to know that.

504
00:37:35,837 --> 00:37:38,213
I'm sorry, Martin.
She's wrong.

505
00:37:39,883 --> 00:37:41,425
No, she's not.

506
00:37:46,598 --> 00:37:47,848
All right, fellows

507
00:37:47,933 --> 00:37:49,892
let's cut this ugly
son of a bitch down

508
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:51,894
before it stinks up
the whole island.

509
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:55,731
Harve, you and Carl take it out tomorrow
and dump it in the drink.

510
00:39:07,721 --> 00:39:09,096
Come here.

511
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:13,934
Give us a kiss.

512
00:39:14,019 --> 00:39:15,144
Why?

513
00:39:17,731 --> 00:39:19,481
Because I need it.

514
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:25,446
Get out of here.

515
00:39:26,573 --> 00:39:27,698
Can I help you?

516
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:29,366
The door was open.
Mind if I come in?

517
00:39:29,451 --> 00:39:30,993
I'm Matt Hooper.

518
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:32,536
Oh, hi. Ellen Brody.

519
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,121
- Your husband's home?
- Yes.

520
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:35,831
I'd really like to talk to him.

521
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:37,499
Yes, so would I.

522
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:40,711
Come in.
Can I get you some coffee?

523
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:42,004
No. Nothing, thank you.

524
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:43,756
Oh, wine. How nice.

525
00:40:02,692 --> 00:40:04,359
How was your day?

526
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:11,450
Swell.

527
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:17,498
I got red and white.
I didn't know what you'd be serving.

528
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:19,041
Oh, that's nice.

529
00:40:20,335 --> 00:40:22,294
Is anyone eating this?

530
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:23,587
No.

531
00:40:31,805 --> 00:40:34,515
My husband tells me
you're in sharks.

532
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:40,145
Excuse me. Yes.
I've never heard it quite put that way.

533
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:41,730
But yes, I am.

534
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:43,482
I love sharks.

535
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:44,608
You love sharks?

536
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:46,026
Yeah, I love them.

537
00:40:46,111 --> 00:40:48,362
When I was 12 years old,
my father got me a boat

538
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:50,197
and I went fishing off of Cape Cod.

539
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:52,449
I hooked a scup and
as I was reeling it in

540
00:40:52,534 --> 00:40:55,369
I hooked a 4.5 foot baby thresher shark

541
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,079
who proceeded to eat my boat.

542
00:40:58,581 --> 00:41:02,209
He ate my oar, hooks,
and my seat cushions.

543
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:03,669
He turned an inboard
into an outboard

544
00:41:03,753 --> 00:41:07,089
scared me to death,
and I swam back to shore.

545
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:09,633
When I was on the beach,
I turned around

546
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:11,677
and actually saw my boat
being taken apart.

547
00:41:11,761 --> 00:41:14,346
Ever since then,
I have been studying sharks

548
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:18,183
and that's why I know that I'm going
to go to the Institute tomorrow

549
00:41:18,268 --> 00:41:20,853
and tell them that you still have
a shark problem here.

550
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:22,896
- Why do you have to tell them that?
- Sorry.

551
00:41:22,981 --> 00:41:24,606
I'm sorry, I thought that...

552
00:41:24,691 --> 00:41:25,983
You told me the shark was caught.

553
00:41:26,067 --> 00:41:28,652
I heard it on the news.
I heard it on the Cape station.

554
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:31,321
They caught a shark,
not the shark.

555
00:41:31,823 --> 00:41:34,408
Not the shark that killed
Chrissie Watkins.

556
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:37,286
And probably not the shark
that killed the little boy.

557
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:40,164
Which I wanted to prove today
by cutting the shark open...

558
00:41:40,248 --> 00:41:43,333
You may want to let that breathe...
Nothing.

559
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:03,270
You know, you'll be
the only rational man

560
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:05,063
left on this island
after I leave tomorrow.

561
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:07,316
Where are you going?

562
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:10,360
I am going on the <i>Aurora.</i>

563
00:42:10,445 --> 00:42:11,862
The <i>Aurora?</i> What is that?

564
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:14,865
It's a floating asylum
for shark addicts.

565
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:16,992
It's pure research,
18 months at sea.

566
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:20,954
Martin hates boats.
Martin hates water.

567
00:42:21,581 --> 00:42:25,667
Martin sits in his car
when we go on the ferry to the mainland.

568
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,961
I guess it's a childhood thing.

569
00:42:28,046 --> 00:42:29,713
There's a clinical name for it,
isn't there?

570
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:31,256
Drowning.

571
00:42:32,008 --> 00:42:33,967
Is it true that most people get attacked

572
00:42:34,052 --> 00:42:36,303
by sharks in three feet of water

573
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:38,013
about 10 feet from the beach?

574
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:39,181
Yeah.

575
00:42:39,766 --> 00:42:43,310
And that before people
started to swim for recreation...

576
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:46,563
I mean, before sharks knew
what they were missing

577
00:42:46,648 --> 00:42:49,942
that a lot of these attacks
weren't reported?

578
00:42:50,026 --> 00:42:51,276
That's right.

579
00:42:53,363 --> 00:42:56,156
Now this shark that swims alone

580
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:57,449
- what's it called?
- Rogue.

581
00:42:57,533 --> 00:42:58,951
Rogue, yeah.

582
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:02,496
This guy, he keeps swimming around

583
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,373
in a place where the feeding is good

584
00:43:04,457 --> 00:43:06,333
until the food supply is gone, right?

585
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:07,918
That's called territoriality.

586
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:11,255
It's just a theory that
I happen to agree with.

587
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:15,425
Then why don't we have
one more drink

588
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:18,011
and go down
and cut that shark open?

589
00:43:18,513 --> 00:43:21,223
Martin? Can you do that?

590
00:43:25,061 --> 00:43:28,063
I can do anything.
I'm the Chief of Police.

591
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:37,197
We start in the alimentary canal

592
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:41,243
and open the digestive tract.

593
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:12,149
Just like I thought.

594
00:44:12,233 --> 00:44:13,233
What?

595
00:44:14,235 --> 00:44:17,571
Came up in the Gulf Stream,
from southern waters.

596
00:44:22,869 --> 00:44:24,161
He didn't eat a car, did he?

597
00:44:24,245 --> 00:44:25,370
No.

598
00:44:25,705 --> 00:44:28,457
Tiger shark's like a garbage can.
It'll eat anything.

599
00:44:28,541 --> 00:44:31,501
Somebody probably threw that
in the river.

600
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,176
That's it.

601
00:44:41,012 --> 00:44:44,097
I've got to close the beach,
call the Mayor.

602
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:47,309
You got a bigger problem than that, Martin.

603
00:44:47,393 --> 00:44:49,936
You still got a hell of a fish out there

604
00:44:50,021 --> 00:44:51,813
with a mouth about this big.

605
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:58,487
How do we confirm that by morning?

606
00:44:59,322 --> 00:45:03,325
If he is a rogue,
and there's any truth to territoriality at all

607
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:05,202
we got a good chance of spotting him

608
00:45:05,286 --> 00:45:06,995
between Cape Scott and South Beach.

609
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:08,205
Where are you going?

610
00:45:08,289 --> 00:45:09,706
To find him.
He's a night feeder.

611
00:45:09,832 --> 00:45:10,832
On the water?

612
00:45:10,917 --> 00:45:12,417
We're not gonna find him on the land.

613
00:45:12,502 --> 00:45:13,877
I'm not drunk enough
to go on a boat.

614
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:15,003
Yes, you are.

615
00:45:15,088 --> 00:45:16,380
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

616
00:45:16,464 --> 00:45:17,923
- I can't do that.
- Yes, you can.

617
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:30,727
I'm telling you, the crime rate in New York
will kill you.

618
00:45:30,812 --> 00:45:34,731
There's so many problems,
you never feel like you're accomplishing anything.

619
00:45:34,816 --> 00:45:37,818
Violence, rip-offs, muggings.

620
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:39,069
The kids can't leave the house.

621
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:41,279
You've got to walk them to school.

622
00:45:41,364 --> 00:45:44,366
But in Amity,
one man can make a difference.

623
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:47,077
In 25 years, there's never been

624
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:48,829
a shooting or a murder in this town.

625
00:45:49,705 --> 00:45:52,207
No kidding? Want a pretzel?

626
00:45:52,959 --> 00:45:54,167
Where are we?

627
00:45:54,252 --> 00:45:57,254
We're right in the stretch
where he's been feeding.

628
00:45:59,715 --> 00:46:01,591
Can you get <i>The Late Show</i>
on this thing?

629
00:46:01,676 --> 00:46:03,260
No, it's a closed circuit TV system.

630
00:46:03,344 --> 00:46:05,887
I have underwater cameras fore-and-aft.

631
00:46:06,514 --> 00:46:08,223
Who pays for all this stuff?

632
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:09,724
The government? The Institute?

633
00:46:09,809 --> 00:46:11,852
This stuff costs a lot of money.

634
00:46:13,396 --> 00:46:15,772
I paid for this mostly myself, actually.

635
00:46:15,857 --> 00:46:17,649
- You're kidding.
- No.

636
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:19,985
- You rich?
- Yeah.

637
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:22,154
How much?

638
00:46:22,238 --> 00:46:23,738
Personally, or the whole family?

639
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:29,327
Doesn't make any sense.
They pay a guy like you to watch sharks?

640
00:46:29,745 --> 00:46:33,206
Well, it doesn't make sense for a guy

641
00:46:33,291 --> 00:46:34,833
who hates the water
to live on an island either.

642
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:38,712
It's only an island
if you look at it from the water.

643
00:46:38,963 --> 00:46:40,755
That makes a lot of sense.

644
00:46:46,721 --> 00:46:48,472
What is that thing doing?

645
00:46:49,849 --> 00:46:51,892
Well, it's a fish finder.

646
00:46:51,976 --> 00:46:54,060
It's probably just
a school of mackerel or something,

647
00:46:54,145 --> 00:46:56,146
all clumped together.

648
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:00,192
Wait a minute.

649
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:06,406
There's something else out there.

650
00:47:06,491 --> 00:47:07,824
What is it?

651
00:47:08,326 --> 00:47:10,869
About 100 yards, south-southwest.

652
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:47,280
That's Ben Gardner's boat.

653
00:47:47,365 --> 00:47:48,615
You know him?

654
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:52,285
It's all banged up.
Sure I know him. He's a fisherman.

655
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:55,413
What happened?

656
00:48:01,504 --> 00:48:03,755
Martin, I gotta go down
and check their hull.

657
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,924
Wait. Why don't we just tow it all in?

658
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:08,635
We will.
I just got to check something out.

659
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:10,554
Hit the lights for me.

660
00:48:34,996 --> 00:48:36,204
Let's tow it in.

661
00:48:36,289 --> 00:48:39,457
Don't worry, Martin.
Nothing's going to happen.

662
00:48:44,213 --> 00:48:46,381
What am I supposed to do
while you're gone?

663
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:49,009
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.

664
00:48:49,093 --> 00:48:50,635
Don't touch any of the equipment.

665
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:55,181
I'll be back in two minutes.

666
00:50:22,645 --> 00:50:24,729
This is a great white, Larry.
A big one.

667
00:50:24,814 --> 00:50:27,691
Any shark expert will tell you
it's a killer, a man-eater.

668
00:50:27,775 --> 00:50:30,527
The situation is that apparently
a great white shark

669
00:50:30,611 --> 00:50:32,904
has staked a claim
in the waters off Amity Island.

670
00:50:32,988 --> 00:50:36,199
He'll continue to feed here
as long as there's food in the water.

671
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:37,867
There's no limit
to what he'll do.

672
00:50:37,952 --> 00:50:39,327
We've had three incidents.

673
00:50:39,412 --> 00:50:41,830
Two people killed within a week.
It'll happen again.

674
00:50:41,914 --> 00:50:43,998
It happened before.
The Jersey beach, 1916.

675
00:50:44,125 --> 00:50:46,042
- Five people were killed...
- In one week.

676
00:50:46,127 --> 00:50:47,377
Tell him about the swimmers.

677
00:50:47,461 --> 00:50:50,714
A shark is attracted to the exact kind
of splashing and activity

678
00:50:50,798 --> 00:50:53,633
that occurs whenever human beings swim.
You can't avoid it.

679
00:50:53,718 --> 00:50:57,387
Opening the beaches on the Fourth of July
is like ringing the dinner bell.

680
00:50:57,471 --> 00:50:58,847
Look, Mr. Vaughn

681
00:50:58,931 --> 00:51:01,641
I pulled a tooth
the size of a shot glass

682
00:51:01,726 --> 00:51:03,268
out of the wrecked hull
of a boat out there.

683
00:51:03,352 --> 00:51:04,853
It was the tooth of a great white.

684
00:51:04,937 --> 00:51:06,604
It was Gardner's boat, all chewed up.

685
00:51:06,689 --> 00:51:08,982
I helped tow it in.
You should've seen it!

686
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:11,818
Where is that tooth?
Did you see it, Brody?

687
00:51:12,194 --> 00:51:13,820
I didn't see it.
He dropped it on the way in.

688
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:15,947
I had an accident.

689
00:51:16,115 --> 00:51:19,284
And what did you say
the name of this shark is?

690
00:51:20,619 --> 00:51:23,538
It's a <i>Carcharodon carcharias.</i>
It's a great white.

691
00:51:23,748 --> 00:51:25,707
You don't have the tooth?

692
00:51:26,959 --> 00:51:29,794
Look, we depend on the summer people
for our very lives...

693
00:51:29,879 --> 00:51:32,964
You won't have a summer
unless you deal with this problem!

694
00:51:33,048 --> 00:51:36,217
We have to close the beach
and hire someone to kill the shark!

695
00:51:36,302 --> 00:51:38,094
We have to tell the Coast Guard.

696
00:51:38,179 --> 00:51:41,139
You'll have to contact
the Shark Research Panel.

697
00:51:41,223 --> 00:51:43,516
You'll have to ring
this entire harbor!

698
00:51:43,601 --> 00:51:45,310
I don't think either one of you

699
00:51:45,394 --> 00:51:47,103
are familiar with our problems!

700
00:51:47,188 --> 00:51:49,397
I think that I am familiar
with the fact

701
00:51:49,482 --> 00:51:51,649
that you'll ignore
this particular problem

702
00:51:51,734 --> 00:51:54,068
until it swims up
and bites you in the ass!

703
00:51:54,153 --> 00:51:57,155
Wait a second!
There are two ways to deal with this problem!

704
00:51:57,239 --> 00:52:00,366
You either kill this animal
or cut off its food supply.

705
00:52:00,451 --> 00:52:02,327
We have to close the beaches.

706
00:52:02,411 --> 00:52:03,536
Brody?

707
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:06,164
Sick vandalism.

708
00:52:06,248 --> 00:52:10,335
That is a deliberate mutilation
of a public service message.

709
00:52:10,628 --> 00:52:13,546
I want those little
paint-happy bastards caught

710
00:52:13,631 --> 00:52:15,340
and hung up by their Buster Browns.

711
00:52:15,424 --> 00:52:18,468
That's it. I won't waste my time
arguing with a man

712
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:19,761
who's lining up to be a hot lunch.

713
00:52:19,845 --> 00:52:21,137
I'm gonna see you later, Brody.

714
00:52:21,222 --> 00:52:23,306
Don't do this. He's not...

715
00:52:29,939 --> 00:52:34,776
What we are dealing with here
is a perfect engine, an eating machine.

716
00:52:35,361 --> 00:52:37,070
It's really a miracle of evolution.

717
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:40,990
All this machine does
is swim and eat

718
00:52:41,242 --> 00:52:43,743
and make little sharks.
And that's all.

719
00:52:43,953 --> 00:52:46,746
Why don't you take a long,
close look at this sign?

720
00:52:46,831 --> 00:52:48,998
Those proportions are correct.

721
00:52:49,083 --> 00:52:50,333
You'd love to prove that,
wouldn't you?

722
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:53,378
Get your name into the
<i>National Geographic.</i>

723
00:53:04,765 --> 00:53:06,641
Larry, if we make an effort today,

724
00:53:06,725 --> 00:53:08,560
we might be able to save August.

725
00:53:08,644 --> 00:53:10,645
August? For Christ's sake,

726
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:12,188
tomorrow's the Fourth of July!

727
00:53:12,273 --> 00:53:14,190
We will be open for business.

728
00:53:14,275 --> 00:53:16,192
It'll be one of the best summers
we've ever had.

729
00:53:16,277 --> 00:53:18,236
If you are concerned
about the beaches,

730
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:20,530
do whatever you have to,
to make them safe.

731
00:53:20,614 --> 00:53:23,825
But those beaches will be open
for this weekend.

732
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:48,808
I want to know how many men
you're going to send.

733
00:53:48,893 --> 00:53:51,102
There is no need for me
to come to Brisbane

734
00:53:51,186 --> 00:53:53,730
when I have a great white shark
right here!

735
00:53:53,898 --> 00:53:56,065
<i>We need men to patrol
the swimming area.</i>

736
00:53:56,150 --> 00:53:59,235
<i>We've got to have help.
Anybody with a gun or a boat.</i>

737
00:54:12,833 --> 00:54:13,958
Monday!

738
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:17,420
Is Chief Federal Officer Feldman there?

739
00:54:17,504 --> 00:54:19,589
He's the little guy
with a crew cut.

740
00:54:36,857 --> 00:54:39,233
Operator, isn't there a phone
on the island?

741
00:54:39,318 --> 00:54:40,526
Could you connect me, please?

742
00:54:47,993 --> 00:54:50,203
Come on, get him!

743
00:54:52,206 --> 00:54:53,831
Careful on the beach.

744
00:54:55,834 --> 00:54:58,211
Brody to Gotcha, do you read me?

745
00:54:59,546 --> 00:55:02,215
The guys from the TV station
on the mainland are here.

746
00:55:02,341 --> 00:55:04,676
All right.
I'll get to them later.

747
00:55:07,972 --> 00:55:10,348
Brody to Scutbucket,
please come in.

748
00:55:17,398 --> 00:55:19,065
Brody to Daisy,
do you read me?

749
00:55:19,149 --> 00:55:20,733
<i>Fascinating Rhythm,
do you read me?</i>

750
00:55:20,818 --> 00:55:22,485
<i>Come in, Hooper.
What do you see?</i>

751
00:55:22,569 --> 00:55:25,363
Nothing here, Martin.
And nothing on sonar.

752
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:29,575
Amity Island has long been known
for its clean air, clear water

753
00:55:29,702 --> 00:55:31,869
and beautiful white-sand beaches.

754
00:55:32,204 --> 00:55:33,496
But in recent days

755
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:35,248
a cloud has appeared on the horizon

756
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:37,250
of this beautiful resort community.

757
00:55:37,334 --> 00:55:39,752
A cloud in the shape
of a killer shark.

758
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:50,596
<i>That is very shocking
in the outfield.</i>

759
00:55:50,681 --> 00:55:54,517
<i>Two balls, one strike,
runners at first and third...</i>

760
00:55:56,270 --> 00:55:58,438
<i>Fly ball, deep left field.</i>

761
00:55:58,522 --> 00:56:02,108
<i>Jerry Christian goes back,
running back near the wall</i>

762
00:56:02,234 --> 00:56:04,110
<i>and he takes it for the out.</i>

763
00:56:09,616 --> 00:56:11,159
Oh, hi, Larry.

764
00:56:11,243 --> 00:56:12,744
Why aren't you in the water?

765
00:56:14,621 --> 00:56:16,831
I just put some suntan lotion on,

766
00:56:16,915 --> 00:56:18,791
and I'm trying to absorb some...

767
00:56:18,917 --> 00:56:20,626
Nobody's going in.

768
00:56:21,712 --> 00:56:23,796
Please, get in the water.

769
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:21,104
Mike, come here.

770
00:57:24,942 --> 00:57:26,943
Listen, Mike.
Do me a favor, will you?

771
00:57:27,027 --> 00:57:28,236
You and the other guys
take the boat

772
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:30,863
and put it in the pond instead?

773
00:57:31,698 --> 00:57:33,199
The pond is for old ladies.

774
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:34,408
I know it's for the old ladies,

775
00:57:34,493 --> 00:57:36,786
but just do it for the old man.

776
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:37,870
Please?

777
00:57:37,955 --> 00:57:38,955
All right.

778
00:57:39,790 --> 00:57:41,040
Thanks.

779
00:57:53,387 --> 00:57:55,221
I've got Sean.

780
00:57:59,143 --> 00:58:01,811
Michael! Wait!

781
00:58:04,565 --> 00:58:06,732
Michael, I don't like you no more.

782
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:18,536
I can stand Harry, you know...

783
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:35,344
Daisy, this is Hendricks.
Anything?

784
00:58:35,429 --> 00:58:36,762
Thought I saw a shadow. Over.

785
00:58:37,431 --> 00:58:40,516
<i>Hendricks, this is Daisy here.
I don't see anything.</i>

786
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:44,270
False alarm.
Must be this glare.

787
00:58:55,532 --> 00:58:59,202
I'm pleased and happy to repeat the news
that we have in fact

788
00:58:59,286 --> 00:59:01,787
caught and killed a large predator

789
00:59:01,872 --> 00:59:03,789
that supposedly injured some bathers.

790
00:59:03,916 --> 00:59:05,625
As you see,
it's a beautiful day.

791
00:59:05,709 --> 00:59:09,045
The beaches are open,
and people are having a wonderful time.

792
00:59:09,129 --> 00:59:11,714
"Amity," as you know,
means "friendship."

793
00:59:25,896 --> 00:59:27,104
My God!

794
00:59:36,657 --> 00:59:39,325
Jesus Christ!
Fin! Shark! 350!

795
00:59:41,745 --> 00:59:42,995
<i>Get in there as fast as you can!</i>

796
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:44,288
Red one.

797
00:59:44,790 --> 00:59:47,333
<i>Martin, get them
the hell out of the water.</i>

798
00:59:52,297 --> 00:59:54,090
No whistles!

799
00:59:54,258 --> 00:59:56,133
<i>Everybody, please,
get out of the water.</i>

800
00:59:56,218 --> 00:59:57,677
<i>Everybody out of the water.</i>

801
00:59:57,761 --> 01:00:02,181
<i>Don't push!
Everybody out of the water, please.</i>

802
01:00:41,138 --> 01:00:42,179
Come on!

803
01:01:02,993 --> 01:01:04,493
<i>I want them out of there, guys.</i>

804
01:01:04,578 --> 01:01:07,496
<i>Give an answer, please.
What's going on out there?</i>

805
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:14,211
He made me do it.
He talked me into it.

806
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:18,591
Please, move back.
Give these people some air.

807
01:01:18,925 --> 01:01:20,926
Please, move back.

808
01:01:21,219 --> 01:01:25,598
Martin, it's just a hoax.
There are two kids with a cardboard fin.

809
01:01:25,766 --> 01:01:29,393
Is everyone there okay?
Everyone get out of the water all right?

810
01:01:30,354 --> 01:01:35,274
<i>Folks, we had some practical joker
down there with a fake fin...</i>

811
01:01:35,734 --> 01:01:38,069
Shark! A shark!

812
01:01:39,363 --> 01:01:42,031
It's going into the pond!
Shark in estuary!

813
01:01:42,115 --> 01:01:43,282
Now what?

814
01:01:44,618 --> 01:01:46,452
Michael's in the pond.

815
01:01:46,745 --> 01:01:51,415
It's going in the pond!
Somebody do something! It's in the pond!

816
01:02:03,595 --> 01:02:04,845
Hurry up, get that done.

817
01:02:04,930 --> 01:02:06,138
I can't do a damn thing.

818
01:02:06,264 --> 01:02:09,058
Get that rope undone.
You gotta untangle that up there.

819
01:02:09,142 --> 01:02:10,434
I'm doing it!

820
01:02:11,269 --> 01:02:15,648
Hey, fellows, haul in your sheet.
Make it fast.

821
01:02:19,403 --> 01:02:22,238
You guys okay over there?

822
01:02:22,656 --> 01:02:23,823
In the pond!

823
01:03:05,532 --> 01:03:07,992
Somebody get a gun and shoot it!

824
01:03:08,076 --> 01:03:09,535
Doesn't anybody have a gun?

825
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:33,476
Is he dead?

826
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:35,561
No, he's not. He's in shock.

827
01:04:06,927 --> 01:04:08,844
Doctor said he's okay.
Mild shock.

828
01:04:08,929 --> 01:04:10,012
He can go home in the morning.

829
01:04:10,096 --> 01:04:11,430
Thank you.

830
01:04:13,058 --> 01:04:14,099
How's my big kid?

831
01:04:14,184 --> 01:04:15,184
I'm all right.

832
01:04:15,268 --> 01:04:18,020
You going to miss me tonight?
You can watch television.

833
01:04:18,104 --> 01:04:19,355
Want me to bring anything from home?

834
01:04:19,439 --> 01:04:20,689
My cars.

835
01:04:20,774 --> 01:04:21,774
What about ice cream?

836
01:04:21,858 --> 01:04:22,858
Coffee.

837
01:04:35,121 --> 01:04:36,956
Want to take him home?

838
01:04:39,084 --> 01:04:40,793
Back to New York?

839
01:04:41,086 --> 01:04:43,087
No. Home, here.

840
01:05:01,690 --> 01:05:03,857
I'm sorry, I'm truly sorry.

841
01:05:05,151 --> 01:05:06,777
You got a pen, Larry?

842
01:05:07,571 --> 01:05:09,196
Yeah, a pen, you know.

843
01:05:12,659 --> 01:05:14,827
'Cause you're going to do
what you do best.

844
01:05:14,911 --> 01:05:17,955
You're going to sign this voucher
so I can hire a contractor.

845
01:05:18,039 --> 01:05:19,915
I don't know
if I can do that without...

846
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,960
I'm going to hire Quint
to kill the shark.

847
01:05:23,253 --> 01:05:24,753
- August?
- What?

848
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:27,464
What are you talking about?

849
01:05:27,549 --> 01:05:29,967
Summer's over.
You're the mayor of Shark City.

850
01:05:30,051 --> 01:05:31,885
People think you want the beaches open.

851
01:05:31,970 --> 01:05:35,598
I was acting in
the town's best interest.

852
01:05:35,682 --> 01:05:37,891
You were acting in
the town's best interest.

853
01:05:37,976 --> 01:05:39,893
That's why you'll do the right thing.

854
01:05:39,978 --> 01:05:41,228
That's why you're going to sign this,

855
01:05:41,313 --> 01:05:44,356
and we'll pay that guy
what he wants.

856
01:05:48,445 --> 01:05:50,904
My kids were on that beach, too.

857
01:06:01,750 --> 01:06:03,334
Sign it, Larry.

858
01:06:13,219 --> 01:06:14,386
<i>$10,000.</i>

859
01:06:14,512 --> 01:06:16,764
<i>$200 a day,
whether I catch him or not.</i>

860
01:06:16,848 --> 01:06:17,890
<i>You've got it.</i>

861
01:06:18,058 --> 01:06:21,393
Get the Mayor off my back
so I don't have more of this zoning crap.

862
01:06:21,478 --> 01:06:22,895
You've got that.

863
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:26,732
One case of apricot brandy,
and you buy the lunch.

864
01:06:26,858 --> 01:06:30,069
Two cases.
And you get dinner when you get back.

865
01:06:30,236 --> 01:06:32,404
Champagne, <i>pte de foie gras,</i>

866
01:06:32,489 --> 01:06:35,074
Iranian caviar,
and don't forget the color TV.

867
01:06:38,578 --> 01:06:42,706
Chief, you try this. Made it myself.
Pretty good stuff.

868
01:06:42,999 --> 01:06:44,249
Thanks.

869
01:06:44,834 --> 01:06:47,711
Here's to swimming
with bow-legged women.

870
01:06:54,886 --> 01:06:56,595
Excuse me, Chief.

871
01:07:11,027 --> 01:07:13,946
Can't get a good man these days,
under 60.

872
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:16,448
All gone at least 35 years.

873
01:07:16,533 --> 01:07:17,950
Don't drink that.

874
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:19,284
Mr. Quint...

875
01:07:23,790 --> 01:07:25,332
You're gonna need an extra hand.

876
01:07:25,458 --> 01:07:27,126
- This is Matt Hooper.
- I know who he is.

877
01:07:27,210 --> 01:07:28,210
I've crewed three Trans Pacs.

878
01:07:28,294 --> 01:07:29,294
Transplants?

879
01:07:29,379 --> 01:07:30,796
He's from the Oceanographic Institute.

880
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,756
And an America's Cup trial.

881
01:07:32,841 --> 01:07:34,383
Mr. Hooper, I'm not talking

882
01:07:34,467 --> 01:07:37,177
about pleasure boating
or day-sailing.

883
01:07:37,971 --> 01:07:41,724
I'm talking about working for a living.
I'm talking about sharking.

884
01:07:41,975 --> 01:07:45,102
I'm not talking about hooking
some poor dogfish or sand shark.

885
01:07:45,186 --> 01:07:47,271
I'm talking about finding a great white.

886
01:07:47,355 --> 01:07:49,648
Porkers? Talking about porkers?

887
01:07:54,696 --> 01:07:56,822
Just tie me a sheepshank.

888
01:07:59,534 --> 01:08:02,661
I haven't had to pass basic seamanship
in a long time.

889
01:08:03,705 --> 01:08:06,498
You didn't say how short you wanted it.

890
01:08:08,668 --> 01:08:10,085
How's that?

891
01:08:13,506 --> 01:08:15,007
Give me your hands.

892
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:18,135
Dogfish?

893
01:08:18,219 --> 01:08:21,597
You got a $5,000 net
and you got $2,000 worth of fish in it.

894
01:08:21,681 --> 01:08:24,725
Along comes Mr. Whitey,
and when he's finished with that net

895
01:08:24,851 --> 01:08:26,393
it looks like a kiddies' scissors class

896
01:08:26,478 --> 01:08:28,771
has cut it up for a paper doll.

897
01:08:30,523 --> 01:08:32,441
You got city hands, Mr. Hooper.

898
01:08:32,525 --> 01:08:34,443
You been counting money
all your life.

899
01:08:34,527 --> 01:08:38,030
I don't need this.
I don't need this working-class-hero crap.

900
01:08:38,364 --> 01:08:41,909
You're not going to do this aboard the ship
are you, Mr. Quint?

901
01:08:43,578 --> 01:08:45,537
Maybe I should go alone.

902
01:08:48,416 --> 01:08:50,542
It's my party. It's my charter.

903
01:08:50,752 --> 01:08:54,046
Yeah, it's your charter, it's your party.
It's my vessel.

904
01:08:54,214 --> 01:08:58,050
You're on board my vessel,
I'm mate, master, pilot

905
01:08:58,885 --> 01:09:00,385
and I'm captain.

906
01:09:03,723 --> 01:09:05,891
I'll take him for ballast, Chief.

907
01:09:08,603 --> 01:09:09,812
You got him.

908
01:09:10,897 --> 01:09:13,607
"Straight-jet, killing lance.

909
01:09:14,067 --> 01:09:18,654
"Tail rope, eye splice, M-1,
handy billy, pliers, irons..."

910
01:09:19,405 --> 01:09:22,616
Sample bottles, dye marker,
flares, safety float

911
01:09:22,742 --> 01:09:25,452
temperature gauge, spear guns, SMG...

912
01:09:25,578 --> 01:09:28,747
What are you?
Some kind of half-assed astronaut?

913
01:09:37,257 --> 01:09:40,759
Take that stuff down below
and you lash it secure, all right?

914
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:47,516
Jesus H. Christ!

915
01:09:48,268 --> 01:09:50,269
When I was a boy,
every squirt wanted

916
01:09:50,353 --> 01:09:53,021
to be a harpooner
or a swordfisherman.

917
01:09:53,940 --> 01:09:57,192
What have you got here?
A portable shower or a monkey cage?

918
01:09:57,277 --> 01:09:58,694
An anti-shark cage.

919
01:09:58,778 --> 01:10:00,320
Anti-shark cage?

920
01:10:01,531 --> 01:10:03,282
You go inside the cage?

921
01:10:05,451 --> 01:10:10,122
Cage goes in the water? You go in the water?
Shark's in the water.

922
01:10:11,291 --> 01:10:12,624
Our shark.

923
01:10:14,669 --> 01:10:19,172
<i>Farewell and adieu
to you fair Spanish ladies</i>

924
01:10:19,966 --> 01:10:23,844
<i>Farewell and adieu,
you ladies of Spain</i>

925
01:10:24,721 --> 01:10:29,808
<i>For we've received orders
for to sail back to Boston</i>

926
01:10:31,185 --> 01:10:35,397
<i>And so nevermore
shall we see you again</i>

927
01:10:42,322 --> 01:10:43,363
Did you take your Dramamine?

928
01:10:43,448 --> 01:10:44,489
Yes.

929
01:10:45,366 --> 01:10:48,744
I put an extra pair of glasses
in your black socks

930
01:10:48,870 --> 01:10:50,537
and there's the stuff
for your nose,

931
01:10:50,622 --> 01:10:53,248
the zinc oxide and Blistex
is in the kit.

932
01:10:53,333 --> 01:10:55,000
Son of a bitch!

933
01:10:55,835 --> 01:10:58,378
Goddamn women today,
they can't handle nothing.

934
01:10:58,504 --> 01:11:00,339
Young girls just ain't quite smart

935
01:11:00,423 --> 01:11:01,882
like their grandmothers were.

936
01:11:02,008 --> 01:11:03,842
That's got to be Quint.

937
01:11:04,177 --> 01:11:05,469
Colorful, isn't he?

938
01:11:05,553 --> 01:11:06,845
He scares me.

939
01:11:09,182 --> 01:11:11,391
Don't use the fireplace in the den...

940
01:11:11,476 --> 01:11:13,685
What am I going
to tell the kids?

941
01:11:16,689 --> 01:11:18,857
Tell them I'm going fishing.

942
01:11:23,529 --> 01:11:27,199
Break it up, will you, Chief?
Daylight's wasting!

943
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:31,703
Front, bow. Back, stern.

944
01:11:31,955 --> 01:11:34,539
Better get it right, squirt,
or I throw your ass

945
01:11:34,624 --> 01:11:36,541
out the little round window
on the side!

946
01:11:36,626 --> 01:11:39,753
Come on, Chief.
This isn't no Boy Scout picnic.

947
01:11:40,463 --> 01:11:41,747
See you got your rubbers.

948
01:11:44,717 --> 01:11:49,221
"Here lies the body of Mary Lee
Died at the age of 103

949
01:11:49,389 --> 01:11:52,307
"For 15 years she kept her virginity

950
01:11:52,392 --> 01:11:54,559
"Not a bad record for this vicinity"

951
01:11:55,228 --> 01:11:58,480
All right, Commissioner,
fasten your safety belt!

952
01:12:00,233 --> 01:12:02,818
If you see a shark, Hooper, swallow!

953
01:12:06,739 --> 01:12:10,742
Up periscope. Rig for depth charge.
Stand by fire drill.

954
01:12:10,827 --> 01:12:13,412
Damage control report.

955
01:12:13,579 --> 01:12:16,581
Nor'easter coming,
bad news for Madison Avenue.

956
01:12:16,791 --> 01:12:19,042
I'm tired of that.

957
01:12:19,127 --> 01:12:20,836
How's the missus, Chief?

958
01:12:21,921 --> 01:12:25,465
If they don't like you going out,
they'll love you coming in.

959
01:12:51,325 --> 01:12:52,576
Keep that chum line going, Chief.

960
01:12:52,660 --> 01:12:55,454
We got five good miles on it.

961
01:12:56,622 --> 01:12:58,040
Who's driving this boat?

962
01:12:58,124 --> 01:12:59,624
Nobody. The tide.

963
01:13:01,002 --> 01:13:03,545
One time, I caught
a 16-footer off Montauk.

964
01:13:03,629 --> 01:13:05,047
Had to stick two barrels in him.

965
01:13:05,131 --> 01:13:07,966
Two to wear him down
and bring him up.

966
01:13:08,342 --> 01:13:10,802
Nowadays, these kids,
they take out everything.

967
01:13:10,887 --> 01:13:14,723
Radar, sonar, electric toothbrushes.

968
01:13:17,310 --> 01:13:19,144
Jesus H. Christ.

969
01:13:19,729 --> 01:13:22,898
Chief, best drop another chum marker.

970
01:13:45,797 --> 01:13:47,464
Damn it, Martin!

971
01:13:48,174 --> 01:13:49,883
This is compressed air.

972
01:13:49,967 --> 01:13:51,510
What the hell kind of a knot was that?

973
01:13:51,594 --> 01:13:53,261
You pulled the wrong one!

974
01:13:53,346 --> 01:13:54,596
You screw around with these tanks,

975
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:56,765
and they're going to blow up.

976
01:13:56,849 --> 01:13:58,892
Yeah, that's real fine,
expensive gear

977
01:13:58,976 --> 01:14:01,478
you've brought out here, Mr. Hooper.

978
01:14:01,604 --> 01:14:04,439
I don't know what that bastard shark's
going to do with it.

979
01:14:04,524 --> 01:14:05,982
Might eat it, I suppose.

980
01:14:06,067 --> 01:14:08,610
Seen one eat a rocking chair one time.

981
01:14:12,532 --> 01:14:16,076
Next time, you just ask me
which line to pull, right?

982
01:14:21,415 --> 01:14:24,334
Little brown eel
comes out of the cave

983
01:14:25,253 --> 01:14:27,129
swims into the hole

984
01:14:28,548 --> 01:14:31,800
comes out of the hole,
goes back into the cave again.

985
01:14:32,885 --> 01:14:34,636
It's not too good, is it?

986
01:14:35,555 --> 01:14:38,223
Nothing's easy, is it?
One more time.

987
01:14:38,474 --> 01:14:40,183
Little brown eel...

988
01:15:59,388 --> 01:16:00,513
I got it!

989
01:16:02,183 --> 01:16:04,226
- What?
- Get behind me.

990
01:16:07,647 --> 01:16:09,397
Hooper, reverse her!

991
01:16:10,233 --> 01:16:12,234
Taking a hell of a lot of line!

992
01:16:12,318 --> 01:16:15,779
Chief, get the scoop out of the bucket!
Wet the reel!

993
01:16:19,575 --> 01:16:21,660
Hooper, reverse her!

994
01:16:25,414 --> 01:16:28,750
Duck your head down. We're swinging.
Get behind me again.

995
01:16:29,126 --> 01:16:32,003
No more water.
I don't want you to drown me.

996
01:16:32,630 --> 01:16:36,049
Hooper, you idiot, starboard!
Ain't you watching it!

997
01:16:40,054 --> 01:16:41,513
Hooper, neutral.

998
01:16:48,896 --> 01:16:50,689
Where'd he go now?

999
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:53,275
He ain't fooling me.

1000
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:56,403
What's he yanking on now?

1001
01:16:57,280 --> 01:16:58,863
Go on, try it.

1002
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:14,546
I don't know, Chief,
if he's very smart or very dumb.

1003
01:17:21,554 --> 01:17:22,721
Jesus...

1004
01:17:26,434 --> 01:17:27,892
He's gone under.

1005
01:17:28,102 --> 01:17:31,896
He's gone under the boat.
I think he's gone under the boat.

1006
01:17:32,690 --> 01:17:34,232
Yeah, it's too easy.

1007
01:17:34,358 --> 01:17:37,610
He is a smart, big fish.
He's gone under the boat.

1008
01:17:38,112 --> 01:17:41,364
Keep her steady, now.
I got something very big!

1009
01:17:41,574 --> 01:17:42,991
I don't think so.

1010
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:46,119
Chief, put your gloves on.

1011
01:17:46,704 --> 01:17:49,289
You put your gloves on,
both of you!

1012
01:17:51,959 --> 01:17:54,002
Getting ready to run out again.

1013
01:17:54,754 --> 01:17:56,379
Quint, let it go.

1014
01:17:56,464 --> 01:17:59,174
Maybe you're a big yahoo in the lab,

1015
01:17:59,258 --> 01:18:00,550
but out here
you're just supercargo!

1016
01:18:00,634 --> 01:18:03,386
If you don't want to backstroke home,
you get down here!

1017
01:18:03,471 --> 01:18:06,389
You don't want to listen to me,
don't listen to me.

1018
01:18:06,474 --> 01:18:07,682
It's not a shark.

1019
01:18:07,767 --> 01:18:09,809
The wire's showing.

1020
01:18:09,894 --> 01:18:11,353
Unbuckle me.

1021
01:18:12,271 --> 01:18:13,855
Get the other side.

1022
01:18:13,939 --> 01:18:15,482
It's a tuna or swordfish

1023
01:18:16,233 --> 01:18:17,901
wasting our time.

1024
01:18:18,611 --> 01:18:20,111
Take this rod.

1025
01:18:20,196 --> 01:18:21,863
Hooper, give the Chief a hand,
will you?

1026
01:18:21,947 --> 01:18:22,989
Right!

1027
01:18:23,074 --> 01:18:24,115
Oh, shit!

1028
01:18:34,293 --> 01:18:37,003
It may be a marlin or a stingray

1029
01:18:37,630 --> 01:18:39,839
but it's definitely a game fish.

1030
01:18:51,602 --> 01:18:52,977
Gaming fish?

1031
01:18:53,687 --> 01:18:57,065
Marlin, stingray bit
through this piano wire?

1032
01:18:57,149 --> 01:18:58,858
Don't you tell me
my business again.

1033
01:18:59,151 --> 01:19:00,151
You get back on the bridge.

1034
01:19:00,236 --> 01:19:02,779
Quint, that doesn't prove a damn thing.

1035
01:19:02,863 --> 01:19:04,989
It proves one thing, Mr. Hooper.

1036
01:19:05,074 --> 01:19:08,243
You wealthy college boys
don't have the education enough

1037
01:19:08,327 --> 01:19:10,078
to admit if you're wrong.

1038
01:19:19,463 --> 01:19:22,215
What's the point?
Hooks and lines?

1039
01:19:24,677 --> 01:19:27,137
You lose one, you rig one.

1040
01:19:31,642 --> 01:19:34,310
Twelve minutes, south-southeast, now!
Full throttle!

1041
01:19:34,395 --> 01:19:35,895
Aye-aye, sir!

1042
01:19:38,023 --> 01:19:41,317
You see, what I do, Chief,
is I trick them to the surface.

1043
01:19:41,735 --> 01:19:43,445
And then I jab at them.

1044
01:19:43,737 --> 01:19:47,198
I'm not going to haul them up
like a lot of catfish.

1045
01:19:47,491 --> 01:19:49,117
Hooper, full throttle!

1046
01:19:49,201 --> 01:19:51,870
I don't have to take this abuse
much longer.

1047
01:19:52,037 --> 01:19:54,998
Your head's bleeding.
First aid there.

1048
01:20:23,736 --> 01:20:26,404
Start that chum line again, will you?

1049
01:20:28,574 --> 01:20:30,700
Let Hooper take a turn.

1050
01:20:30,784 --> 01:20:32,702
Hooper drives the boat, Chief.

1051
01:20:48,219 --> 01:20:50,512
Stop playing with yourself, Hooper.

1052
01:20:50,596 --> 01:20:52,263
Slow ahead, if you please.

1053
01:20:53,098 --> 01:20:55,183
You heard him. Slow ahead.

1054
01:21:03,943 --> 01:21:05,193
Slow ahead.

1055
01:21:05,611 --> 01:21:09,531
I can go slow ahead.
Come on down and chum some of this shit.

1056
01:21:27,007 --> 01:21:29,592
You're going to need a bigger boat.

1057
01:21:44,733 --> 01:21:46,317
Shut off that engine.

1058
01:22:14,263 --> 01:22:15,471
That's a 20-footer.

1059
01:22:15,556 --> 01:22:16,764
Twenty-five.

1060
01:22:17,975 --> 01:22:19,434
Three tons of him.

1061
01:22:24,940 --> 01:22:27,108
We're going to need
a bigger boat, right?

1062
01:22:27,192 --> 01:22:28,610
Gotta get to work.

1063
01:22:29,153 --> 01:22:31,446
How do we handle this?

1064
01:22:31,530 --> 01:22:33,698
Come up front, Martin.
I need you.

1065
01:22:35,701 --> 01:22:37,660
He's circling the boat.

1066
01:22:51,050 --> 01:22:54,802
<i>This is Amity Point Light Station to</i> Orca.

1067
01:22:54,887 --> 01:22:56,054
<i>Come in,</i> Orca.

1068
01:22:56,889 --> 01:22:58,056
<i>Orca.</i> Come in.

1069
01:22:58,182 --> 01:23:00,058
<i>I have Mrs. Martin Brody here.</i>

1070
01:23:00,142 --> 01:23:01,351
Put her on.

1071
01:23:02,519 --> 01:23:03,936
Come on, Martin! Move!

1072
01:23:04,021 --> 01:23:05,396
I'm not going out there!

1073
01:23:05,731 --> 01:23:06,939
Beyond the edge of the barrels.

1074
01:23:07,024 --> 01:23:10,068
Go to the end of the barrels,
further out.

1075
01:23:10,194 --> 01:23:11,736
- Further out!
- Why?

1076
01:23:11,820 --> 01:23:13,571
- Go further out!
- What for?

1077
01:23:13,697 --> 01:23:15,406
Will you go to the end of the pulpit?

1078
01:23:15,491 --> 01:23:16,491
What?

1079
01:23:16,575 --> 01:23:17,659
Will you go to the end of the pulpit?

1080
01:23:17,743 --> 01:23:20,662
I need something in the foreground
to give it some scale!

1081
01:23:20,746 --> 01:23:21,996
Foreground my ass!

1082
01:23:22,081 --> 01:23:23,998
Your husband's okay.
He's fishing.

1083
01:23:24,083 --> 01:23:25,249
He just caught some stripers.

1084
01:23:25,334 --> 01:23:29,087
We'll bring them for dinner.
We ain't seen anything yet. Over. Out.

1085
01:23:29,254 --> 01:23:30,588
I'm not staying here!

1086
01:23:30,673 --> 01:23:31,673
I'm begging you!

1087
01:23:31,757 --> 01:23:35,051
God damn it!
Come here, darling.

1088
01:23:40,349 --> 01:23:42,684
Chief, I want you up on the bridge,

1089
01:23:42,768 --> 01:23:44,018
just take her forward, steady.

1090
01:23:44,103 --> 01:23:45,561
I've never steered a boat in my life.

1091
01:23:45,646 --> 01:23:48,398
Just watch my hand,
take her steady.

1092
01:23:48,899 --> 01:23:52,360
Mr. Hooper, attach the end of this line
to the first keg.

1093
01:23:52,569 --> 01:23:55,446
I've got to get a good shot
at that porker's head.

1094
01:24:10,963 --> 01:24:13,256
He's coming.

1095
01:24:13,799 --> 01:24:16,092
Hooper? Get clear of the bow.

1096
01:24:20,806 --> 01:24:22,223
Hurry up, will you?

1097
01:24:22,307 --> 01:24:23,474
Your turn, Quint.

1098
01:24:24,143 --> 01:24:25,685
Hooper, where are you?

1099
01:24:29,648 --> 01:24:31,649
Hurry it up now, tie it on.

1100
01:24:32,860 --> 01:24:35,403
He's coming straight for us.
Don't screw it up now.

1101
01:24:35,487 --> 01:24:36,988
Don't wait for me.

1102
01:24:39,491 --> 01:24:42,493
Come on, Hooper, hurry it up!
Tie it on!

1103
01:24:43,328 --> 01:24:44,662
Now.

1104
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:49,709
Kill it!

1105
01:24:50,836 --> 01:24:51,961
Now!

1106
01:24:53,839 --> 01:24:54,964
Shoot!

1107
01:24:58,218 --> 01:24:59,385
Time.

1108
01:25:01,054 --> 01:25:02,430
What were you doing?
You knew I had

1109
01:25:02,514 --> 01:25:04,932
to get a clean shot
right in the head.

1110
01:25:05,017 --> 01:25:08,644
All right, let's see how long
that barrel takes to bring him up.

1111
01:25:10,355 --> 01:25:13,524
Bring another barrel!
I'm coming around again!

1112
01:26:07,204 --> 01:26:09,372
What do we do now?
We're quitting, right?

1113
01:26:09,456 --> 01:26:13,459
We got one barrel on him.
We stay out here until we find him again.

1114
01:26:13,585 --> 01:26:16,212
We could radio in
and get a bigger boat...

1115
01:26:41,280 --> 01:26:43,364
Don't you worry about it, Chief.

1116
01:26:44,283 --> 01:26:47,618
It won't be permanent.
You want to see something permanent?

1117
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:57,795
You want to feel something permanent?

1118
01:26:58,964 --> 01:27:02,967
Just put your hand underneath my cap.
You feel that little lump?

1119
01:27:03,051 --> 01:27:06,220
Knocko Nolans, St. Patty's Day, Boston.

1120
01:27:10,559 --> 01:27:12,226
I got that beat.

1121
01:27:20,152 --> 01:27:23,654
It's a moray eel.
It bit right through my wet suit.

1122
01:27:24,740 --> 01:27:26,741
Well, Hoop, now, listen

1123
01:27:26,825 --> 01:27:30,077
I don't know about that,
but I entered an arm-wrestling contest

1124
01:27:30,162 --> 01:27:32,914
in a bar in San Francisco.
See this?

1125
01:27:32,998 --> 01:27:34,540
I can't extend that.
You know why?

1126
01:27:34,875 --> 01:27:36,876
'Cause in the semi-final

1127
01:27:37,044 --> 01:27:39,879
celebrating my third wife's demise,

1128
01:27:39,963 --> 01:27:41,923
big Chinese fellow,
he pulled me right over.

1129
01:27:54,853 --> 01:27:56,354
Look at that.

1130
01:27:58,023 --> 01:27:59,565
That's a bull shark.

1131
01:28:00,025 --> 01:28:02,526
He scraped me when I was taking samples.

1132
01:28:03,362 --> 01:28:05,363
I got something for you.

1133
01:28:06,073 --> 01:28:09,533
There's a thresher. You see that?
A thresher's tail.

1134
01:28:09,701 --> 01:28:11,744
- Thresher?
- It's a shark.

1135
01:28:14,706 --> 01:28:16,791
You want a drink?
Drink to your leg?

1136
01:28:16,875 --> 01:28:17,875
I'll drink to your leg.

1137
01:28:17,960 --> 01:28:19,744
So we drink to our legs.

1138
01:28:25,258 --> 01:28:28,552
I got <i>the crme de la crme.</i>
Right here. Hold on.

1139
01:28:29,596 --> 01:28:31,305
Here, you see that?

1140
01:28:31,723 --> 01:28:33,432
You're wearing a sweater.

1141
01:28:34,226 --> 01:28:36,560
Right there. Mary Ellen Moffit.

1142
01:28:37,729 --> 01:28:39,480
She broke my heart.

1143
01:28:49,741 --> 01:28:51,158
What's that one?

1144
01:28:51,410 --> 01:28:52,660
What?

1145
01:28:52,744 --> 01:28:54,203
That one, there.
On your arm.

1146
01:28:56,957 --> 01:28:58,499
A tattoo. I got that removed.

1147
01:28:58,583 --> 01:29:00,292
Don't tell me.

1148
01:29:01,128 --> 01:29:02,161
"Mother."

1149
01:29:08,093 --> 01:29:09,468
What is it?

1150
01:29:14,474 --> 01:29:17,643
Mr. Hooper, that's the
<i>U.S.S. Indianapolis.</i>

1151
01:29:25,193 --> 01:29:27,153
You were on the <i>Indianapolis?</i>

1152
01:29:27,320 --> 01:29:28,612
What happened?

1153
01:29:30,615 --> 01:29:34,660
Japanese submarine slammed two torpedoes
into her side, Chief.

1154
01:29:35,996 --> 01:29:39,874
I was coming back
from the island of Tinian to Leyte

1155
01:29:39,958 --> 01:29:43,085
just delivered the bomb,
the Hiroshima bomb.

1156
01:29:46,256 --> 01:29:49,008
1,100 men went into the water.

1157
01:29:49,092 --> 01:29:50,926
Vessel went down in 12 minutes.

1158
01:29:53,305 --> 01:29:56,223
Didn't see the first shark
for about half an hour.

1159
01:29:56,475 --> 01:29:58,392
Tiger, 13-footer.

1160
01:29:58,477 --> 01:30:01,353
You know how you know that
when you're in the water, Chief?

1161
01:30:01,438 --> 01:30:04,690
You tell by looking
from the dorsal to the tail.

1162
01:30:06,276 --> 01:30:08,152
Well, we didn't know.

1163
01:30:08,528 --> 01:30:11,655
Because our bomb mission
had been so secret

1164
01:30:12,449 --> 01:30:14,825
no distress signal had been sent.

1165
01:30:21,500 --> 01:30:24,543
They didn't even list us overdue
for a week.

1166
01:30:26,004 --> 01:30:29,507
Very first light,
sharks come cruising

1167
01:30:30,008 --> 01:30:32,927
so we formed ourselves
into tight groups.

1168
01:30:33,804 --> 01:30:36,639
You know, kind of like old squares

1169
01:30:36,723 --> 01:30:38,307
in a battle like you see
on a calendar

1170
01:30:38,391 --> 01:30:41,185
like the Battle of Waterloo.
The idea was...

1171
01:30:41,269 --> 01:30:42,895
the shark comes to the nearest man

1172
01:30:42,979 --> 01:30:45,773
and he starts pounding,
hollering and screaming.

1173
01:30:45,857 --> 01:30:48,484
Sometimes the shark
would go away...

1174
01:30:49,444 --> 01:30:51,445
but sometimes he wouldn't go away.

1175
01:30:51,530 --> 01:30:55,783
Sometimes that shark, he looks
right into you, right into your eyes.

1176
01:30:57,244 --> 01:30:59,870
You know, a thing about a shark,
he's got...

1177
01:31:00,330 --> 01:31:04,333
lifeless eyes.
Black eyes, like a doll's eyes.

1178
01:31:05,961 --> 01:31:09,463
When he comes at you,
he doesn't seem to be living

1179
01:31:09,798 --> 01:31:14,718
until he bites you.
Those black eyes roll over white and then...

1180
01:31:16,221 --> 01:31:19,723
Then you hear
that terrible high-pitched screaming.

1181
01:31:20,142 --> 01:31:22,059
The ocean turns red.

1182
01:31:22,477 --> 01:31:26,313
In spite of the pounding and the hollering,
they all come in.

1183
01:31:28,024 --> 01:31:29,733
They rip you to pieces.

1184
01:31:34,573 --> 01:31:37,575
You know, by the end of that first dawn...

1185
01:31:38,743 --> 01:31:40,369
we lost 100 men.

1186
01:31:41,872 --> 01:31:44,415
I don't know how many sharks.
Maybe 1,000.

1187
01:31:44,541 --> 01:31:47,585
I don't know how many men,
they averaged six an hour.

1188
01:31:48,211 --> 01:31:51,172
On Thursday morning,
I bumped into a friend of mine...

1189
01:31:51,256 --> 01:31:53,674
Herbie Robinson, from Cleveland.

1190
01:31:54,885 --> 01:31:57,511
Baseball player, bosun's mate.

1191
01:31:59,598 --> 01:32:03,642
I thought he was asleep.
Reached over to wake him up.

1192
01:32:05,270 --> 01:32:09,106
He bobbed up and down in the water
just like a kind of top.

1193
01:32:09,774 --> 01:32:11,066
Upended.

1194
01:32:15,113 --> 01:32:17,781
He'd been bitten in half,
below the waist.

1195
01:32:21,620 --> 01:32:25,706
Noon the fifth day,
a Lockheed Ventura saw us.

1196
01:32:25,790 --> 01:32:28,918
He swung in low and he saw us.
He was a young pilot.

1197
01:32:29,002 --> 01:32:30,211
Younger than Mr. Hooper.

1198
01:32:30,295 --> 01:32:33,130
He saw us and he came in low,
and three hours later...

1199
01:32:33,256 --> 01:32:36,717
a big fat PBY comes down
and starts to pick us up.

1200
01:32:36,801 --> 01:32:39,637
That was the time
I was most frightened.

1201
01:32:40,305 --> 01:32:42,139
Waiting for my turn.

1202
01:32:43,516 --> 01:32:46,268
I'll never put on
a life jacket again.

1203
01:32:47,979 --> 01:32:50,439
So, 1,100 men went into the water

1204
01:32:51,149 --> 01:32:53,067
316 men come out.

1205
01:32:53,151 --> 01:32:57,112
The sharks took the rest,
June 29, 1945.

1206
01:33:00,075 --> 01:33:03,827
Anyway, we delivered the bomb.

1207
01:33:16,049 --> 01:33:18,175
What's that?

1208
01:33:18,260 --> 01:33:19,510
It's a whale.

1209
01:33:21,513 --> 01:33:26,475
<i>Farewell and adieu
to you fair Spanish ladies</i>

1210
01:33:27,978 --> 01:33:32,898
<i>Farewell and adieu,
you ladies of Spain</i>

1211
01:33:37,195 --> 01:33:41,240
<i>Show me the way to go home</i>

1212
01:33:42,701 --> 01:33:46,829
<i>I'm tired and I want to go to bed</i>

1213
01:33:48,206 --> 01:33:53,127
<i>I had a little drink
about an hour ago</i>

1214
01:33:53,211 --> 01:33:57,339
<i>And it's gone right to my head</i>

1215
01:33:58,591 --> 01:34:02,594
<i>Wherever I may roam</i>

1216
01:34:03,596 --> 01:34:07,391
<i>By land, or sea or foam</i>

1217
01:34:08,268 --> 01:34:12,938
<i>You will always hear me
singing this song</i>

1218
01:34:14,024 --> 01:34:16,776
<i>Show me the way to go home</i>

1219
01:34:18,570 --> 01:34:22,040
<i>Show me the way to go home</i>

1220
01:34:22,115 --> 01:34:25,242
<i>I'm tired and I want to go to bed</i>

1221
01:34:25,327 --> 01:34:27,911
<i>I had a little drink
about an hour ago</i>

1222
01:34:27,996 --> 01:34:30,331
<i>And it's gone right to my head

1223
01:34:30,582 --> 01:34:32,833
<i>Wherever I may roam</i>

1224
01:34:33,251 --> 01:34:35,586
<i>On land or sea or foam</i>

1225
01:34:35,670 --> 01:34:39,006
<i>You can always hear me singing...</i>

1226
01:34:42,010 --> 01:34:43,594
Start the engines.

1227
01:34:53,772 --> 01:34:56,148
Fire her up!
Right in the middle!

1228
01:34:56,274 --> 01:34:58,609
He's busting the shaft.

1229
01:35:03,656 --> 01:35:05,491
Put out the fire, will you?

1230
01:35:15,126 --> 01:35:16,794
- Pump her out.
- Done.

1231
01:35:25,553 --> 01:35:26,720
Everybody on deck.

1232
01:35:26,805 --> 01:35:27,930
He ate the light.

1233
01:35:28,014 --> 01:35:29,598
- Terrific.
- Excuse me.

1234
01:35:32,143 --> 01:35:35,104
Quint, what are you doing?
Don't waste your time.

1235
01:35:35,188 --> 01:35:36,563
Quint, come on.

1236
01:35:36,648 --> 01:35:38,357
What's wrong with this?

1237
01:35:40,735 --> 01:35:44,571
Hooper, take the wheel.
Brody, follow that. Watch for him.

1238
01:36:02,298 --> 01:36:03,632
You okay?

1239
01:36:31,119 --> 01:36:33,120
Chief, more left rudder!

1240
01:36:34,122 --> 01:36:35,706
Pull your left hand down.

1241
01:36:35,790 --> 01:36:38,834
I can't. It'll only go
about three inches.

1242
01:36:39,002 --> 01:36:40,794
All of our injectors got scored

1243
01:36:40,879 --> 01:36:42,796
from the salt water in the fuel.

1244
01:36:43,673 --> 01:36:46,258
Yeah, the housing's bent,
you can hear it.

1245
01:36:47,135 --> 01:36:51,597
Try the left rudder again.
More left. Good. Once again now.

1246
01:36:54,809 --> 01:36:56,310
Quint, there it is.

1247
01:36:57,270 --> 01:36:58,979
What do you say, Chief?

1248
01:36:59,189 --> 01:37:01,773
The barrel is up,
it's right in the stern.

1249
01:37:05,778 --> 01:37:09,198
I think he's right under the keg.
Grab the boat hook.

1250
01:37:20,543 --> 01:37:23,003
Quint, if we can get close enough...

1251
01:37:24,422 --> 01:37:26,173
I've got things on board
that'll kill it.

1252
01:37:26,257 --> 01:37:29,134
Just want to goose him up.
Come on.

1253
01:37:40,980 --> 01:37:44,691
When he runs, you drop that rope
or you'll lose your hands.

1254
01:37:46,027 --> 01:37:48,195
I've seen fingers
torn out at the knuckles.

1255
01:37:48,279 --> 01:37:50,280
Whole sea's bones, full of them.

1256
01:37:50,365 --> 01:37:52,282
Give it to me a minute.

1257
01:38:07,757 --> 01:38:10,259
Haul in that line
or it'll foul us.

1258
01:38:10,969 --> 01:38:12,427
Start the engine.

1259
01:38:14,764 --> 01:38:16,348
Where are you going?

1260
01:38:16,432 --> 01:38:17,975
I'm going to make a phone call.

1261
01:38:24,399 --> 01:38:26,900
Hello, mayday, <i>Orca.</i>
Coast Guard?

1262
01:38:28,236 --> 01:38:30,737
Coast Guard, this is the <i>Orca.</i>
Do you read me?

1263
01:38:30,822 --> 01:38:33,323
Coast Guard, this is the <i>Orca.</i>
Do you...

1264
01:38:39,414 --> 01:38:40,956
Excuse me, Chief.

1265
01:38:41,332 --> 01:38:44,751
That's great!
That's just great!

1266
01:38:44,836 --> 01:38:46,503
Now, where the hell are we, eh?

1267
01:38:47,922 --> 01:38:51,675
You're certifiable, Quint, you know that?
You're certifiable!

1268
01:38:52,010 --> 01:38:53,802
You're certifiable,
but I'll tell you this!

1269
01:38:53,886 --> 01:38:55,178
Boys,

1270
01:38:56,848 --> 01:38:59,516
I think he's come back
for his noon feeding.

1271
01:39:01,019 --> 01:39:02,811
Hook me up another barrel.

1272
01:39:33,426 --> 01:39:35,260
Bring her around after him.

1273
01:39:52,111 --> 01:39:54,571
Full throttle!
Get me right up alongside of him!

1274
01:39:54,697 --> 01:39:57,949
I can't rev it up that high,
it's not going to take it!

1275
01:40:15,677 --> 01:40:17,260
Five degrees port.

1276
01:40:24,143 --> 01:40:26,103
All right, hold your course.

1277
01:40:32,443 --> 01:40:34,361
Five degrees port now.

1278
01:40:37,865 --> 01:40:39,282
Hold your course.

1279
01:40:40,952 --> 01:40:42,202
Fast fish.

1280
01:40:42,286 --> 01:40:43,453
Watch my hand.

1281
01:40:44,664 --> 01:40:48,208
Be sure you watch my hand!
Follow me.

1282
01:40:49,460 --> 01:40:52,045
Lad, you watch him now! Starboard!

1283
01:40:53,297 --> 01:40:55,132
Run him down, Hooper.

1284
01:41:02,306 --> 01:41:03,640
Hard aport.

1285
01:41:07,478 --> 01:41:09,146
Watch him. Starboard.

1286
01:41:33,963 --> 01:41:37,299
I can't believe it.
Two barrels and he's going down again.

1287
01:41:42,930 --> 01:41:44,347
It's incredible.

1288
01:41:50,396 --> 01:41:52,314
- They're up again!
- Now what?

1289
01:42:01,574 --> 01:42:03,950
Why don't we lead the shark into shore

1290
01:42:04,035 --> 01:42:05,827
instead of him leading us out to sea?

1291
01:42:10,291 --> 01:42:12,000
Grab a couple of poles.

1292
01:42:14,295 --> 01:42:16,421
Hang on now, we're going around.

1293
01:42:17,215 --> 01:42:19,716
Into starboard. Easy.

1294
01:42:20,676 --> 01:42:22,719
I'm going to back her off now.

1295
01:42:22,804 --> 01:42:24,596
Watch those barrels, boys.
Watch them.

1296
01:42:29,143 --> 01:42:31,228
All right, gentlemen, snag them.

1297
01:42:36,484 --> 01:42:38,860
Now then, tie them
to the stern cleats.

1298
01:42:42,114 --> 01:42:44,741
Brody, bring your end
around the cleat.

1299
01:42:45,785 --> 01:42:49,329
That's right, it'll lock itself off.
Give him room, Brody.

1300
01:42:51,415 --> 01:42:53,124
Stay clear of the line!

1301
01:43:00,883 --> 01:43:02,592
Watch it. Stand clear.

1302
01:43:12,728 --> 01:43:15,230
Stand away from those stern cleats!

1303
01:43:28,369 --> 01:43:30,453
Back home we got a taxidermy man.

1304
01:43:30,538 --> 01:43:31,997
He's going to have a heart attack

1305
01:43:32,081 --> 01:43:33,549
when he sees what I brought him.

1306
01:43:40,631 --> 01:43:43,466
Throttle back.
You're losing a cleat.

1307
01:43:46,178 --> 01:43:48,847
My God, this one, too.
They're both going.

1308
01:43:49,098 --> 01:43:51,016
He's eating his way
through that line.

1309
01:43:51,100 --> 01:43:52,976
He's working his way
right up to us.

1310
01:43:53,102 --> 01:43:55,937
Quint!
Come on, Quint. Hurry!

1311
01:43:58,482 --> 01:43:59,774
Out of my way.

1312
01:44:04,989 --> 01:44:05,989
Watch it.

1313
01:44:10,036 --> 01:44:12,662
Untie this.
He'll pull out the transom.

1314
01:44:16,500 --> 01:44:18,460
Make it fast!
We got another line in him!

1315
01:44:18,544 --> 01:44:20,503
I can't, it's trying to run!

1316
01:44:21,881 --> 01:44:23,590
We better get another line!

1317
01:44:23,674 --> 01:44:25,675
Pull, you son of a bitch!

1318
01:44:25,968 --> 01:44:28,178
I hope your back breaks!

1319
01:44:28,262 --> 01:44:30,138
Go ahead.
Pull your bloody heart out.

1320
01:44:30,806 --> 01:44:32,182
Tie him off!

1321
01:44:37,355 --> 01:44:39,689
It's impossible!

1322
01:44:40,900 --> 01:44:42,567
Boys, it's too tight!

1323
01:44:43,027 --> 01:44:44,819
He's pulling us!

1324
01:44:46,739 --> 01:44:48,657
We're breaking up over here!

1325
01:44:55,247 --> 01:44:57,540
We're breaking up! Cut it!

1326
01:44:58,376 --> 01:44:59,834
Watch your hands!

1327
01:45:01,212 --> 01:45:03,254
Cut it quick.
I can't hold it!

1328
01:45:24,402 --> 01:45:26,778
He can't stay down
with three barrels on him.

1329
01:45:26,904 --> 01:45:29,072
Not with three barrels, he can't.

1330
01:45:29,240 --> 01:45:30,740
What about us?

1331
01:45:31,283 --> 01:45:34,953
Hooper, get the pump out of the locker
in front of you, will you?

1332
01:45:35,413 --> 01:45:37,163
We're going to sink, aren't we?

1333
01:45:37,248 --> 01:45:40,208
Keep an eye on the barrels.
Pump it out, Chief.

1334
01:45:46,716 --> 01:45:48,258
Starting to go under.

1335
01:45:48,426 --> 01:45:51,886
He can't with three barrels on him.
Not with three he can't.

1336
01:46:26,756 --> 01:46:28,923
You ever have one do this before?

1337
01:46:31,135 --> 01:46:32,260
No.

1338
01:47:03,918 --> 01:47:06,628
He's chasing us.
I don't believe it.

1339
01:47:11,759 --> 01:47:14,260
I'm going to draw him
into the shallows.

1340
01:47:14,345 --> 01:47:15,553
Draw him into the shallow water.

1341
01:47:15,638 --> 01:47:18,431
I'm going to draw him in
and drown him.

1342
01:47:18,682 --> 01:47:19,891
We're heading in, Brody.

1343
01:47:19,975 --> 01:47:21,142
Thank Christ!

1344
01:47:28,943 --> 01:47:30,026
You ever had a great white do that?

1345
01:47:30,111 --> 01:47:31,444
No.

1346
01:47:37,535 --> 01:47:39,619
How far do we have to go?

1347
01:47:42,206 --> 01:47:44,791
Don't put that much pressure on it.

1348
01:47:54,969 --> 01:47:56,052
God damn it.

1349
01:47:56,137 --> 01:47:57,846
Shut up. Get back there.

1350
01:48:03,561 --> 01:48:04,727
Hold on.

1351
01:48:19,743 --> 01:48:24,998
<i>Farewell and adieu
to you fair Spanish ladies</i>

1352
01:48:27,251 --> 01:48:32,088
<i>Farewell and adieu,
you ladies of Spain</i>

1353
01:48:33,674 --> 01:48:38,845
<i>For we received order
for to sail back to Boston</i>

1354
01:48:39,221 --> 01:48:41,598
You idiot, you burned out the bearings.

1355
01:48:43,267 --> 01:48:46,728
All right, stop the boat. Stop it.

1356
01:50:26,537 --> 01:50:29,914
What exactly can you do
with these things of yours?

1357
01:50:33,752 --> 01:50:37,839
I think I can pump 20 cc
of strychnine nitrate into him.

1358
01:50:38,215 --> 01:50:40,425
If I can get close enough.

1359
01:50:42,886 --> 01:50:45,388
Get this little needle
through his skin?

1360
01:50:47,182 --> 01:50:48,766
No, I can't do that.

1361
01:50:50,728 --> 01:50:52,645
If I can get him
close to the cage,

1362
01:50:52,730 --> 01:50:53,896
I can get him in the mouth.

1363
01:50:53,981 --> 01:50:55,523
That shark will rip
that cage to pieces.

1364
01:50:55,607 --> 01:50:58,026
You got any better suggestions?

1365
01:51:23,260 --> 01:51:24,302
Easy.

1366
01:51:26,889 --> 01:51:28,097
Up she goes.

1367
01:51:29,475 --> 01:51:31,225
Ease her up.

1368
01:52:23,112 --> 01:52:24,570
Ain't got no spit.

1369
01:52:39,920 --> 01:52:42,422
Try and keep him off me
until I'm lower.

1370
01:52:45,175 --> 01:52:46,634
Okay, I'm ready.

1371
01:55:43,312 --> 01:55:47,023
Bring him up, God damn it.
Bring him up now!

1372
01:55:52,613 --> 01:55:54,363
Pull it up. Pull it.

1373
01:56:04,291 --> 01:56:06,876
Pull him up.
Come on, Quint, bring him in.

1374
01:56:10,172 --> 01:56:11,547
It's giving way!

1375
01:56:23,560 --> 01:56:25,519
Rig something!

1376
01:56:28,523 --> 01:56:29,690
Got it?

1377
01:56:33,904 --> 01:56:35,071
It's coming.

1378
01:56:35,739 --> 01:56:37,365
Slow it down.

1379
01:56:37,741 --> 01:56:39,033
Slower.

1380
01:59:50,976 --> 01:59:53,686
All right, come on.

1381
01:59:53,770 --> 01:59:55,312
Show me the tank.

1382
02:00:13,790 --> 02:00:15,124
Blow up!

1383
02:00:18,295 --> 02:00:20,087
Smile, you son of a bitch!

1384
02:01:49,260 --> 02:01:50,386
Quint?

1385
02:01:51,721 --> 02:01:52,805
No.

1386
02:02:02,065 --> 02:02:03,732
Can we get in on those?

1387
02:02:10,407 --> 02:02:11,824
What day is this?

1388
02:02:14,285 --> 02:02:16,662
It's Wednesday.
It's Tuesday, I think.

1389
02:02:18,289 --> 02:02:20,416
I think the tide's with us.

1390
02:02:21,001 --> 02:02:22,584
Keep kicking.

1391
02:02:25,964 --> 02:02:28,090
I used to hate the water.

1392
02:02:30,301 --> 02:02:32,136
I can't imagine why.
