1
00:03:03,822 --> 00:03:05,454
<i>Millenium breaking disaster...</i>

2
00:03:05,455 --> 00:03:09,044
<i>All river traffic has been halted and
police divers search for survivors.</i>

3
00:03:09,117 --> 00:03:11,274
<i>Surrounding area
remains closed.</i>

4
00:03:11,275 --> 00:03:12,275
<i>The man, known to...</i>

5
00:03:19,492 --> 00:03:22,067
Harry Potter.
Who's Harry Potter?

6
00:03:24,133 --> 00:03:25,465
Um, no one.

7
00:03:26,788 --> 00:03:28,016
Bit of a tosser, really.

8
00:03:30,173 --> 00:03:31,726
Funny
that paper of yours.

9
00:03:32,016 --> 00:03:34,553
Couple of minutes ago, I could have sworn
I saw a picture move.

10
00:03:34,588 --> 00:03:35,241
Really?

11
00:03:35,276 --> 00:03:36,782
While I was going
around the train.

12
00:03:43,611 --> 00:03:45,283
- Okay, I was wondering--
- Eleven.

13
00:03:46,386 --> 00:03:47,470
That's when
I get off.

14
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:50,538
You can tell me all about
that tosser Harry Potter.

15
00:04:39,891 --> 00:04:41,793
You've been reckless
this summer, Harry.

16
00:04:42,277 --> 00:04:43,916
I like riding around
the trains.

17
00:04:45,587 --> 00:04:46,890
Takes my mind
off things.

18
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,515
All unpleasant to be old,
isn't it?

19
00:04:50,871 --> 00:04:53,677
The tale is thrilling,
if I say so myself.

20
00:04:54,138 --> 00:04:56,185
But now is not the time
to tell it.

21
00:04:56,724 --> 00:04:57,947
Take my arm.

22
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:02,648
Do as I say.

23
00:05:11,575 --> 00:05:13,455
I hardly just Apparated,
didn't I?

24
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:14,205
Indeed.

25
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,458
Quite successfully too,
I might add.

26
00:05:16,493 --> 00:05:18,529
Most people vomit
the first time.

27
00:05:19,058 --> 00:05:20,406
Can't imagine why.

28
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:31,273
Welcome to the charming village
of Budleigh Babberton.

29
00:05:32,096 --> 00:05:34,671
Harry, I assume right about now
you must be wondering...

30
00:05:34,706 --> 00:05:36,291
why I brought you here?

31
00:05:36,292 --> 00:05:37,403
Am I right?

32
00:05:38,187 --> 00:05:40,915
Actually sir, after all these years,
I just, sort of, go with it.

33
00:05:45,796 --> 00:05:47,044
Wands on, Harry.

34
00:05:58,624 --> 00:05:59,217
Horace!

35
00:06:11,572 --> 00:06:12,314
Horace.

36
00:07:03,029 --> 00:07:04,393
Merlin's beard!

37
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,676
You don't need
to disfigure me, Albus.

38
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:11,642
Well I must say you made
a very convincing armchair, Horace.

39
00:07:12,355 --> 00:07:14,012
It's all
in the upholstery.

40
00:07:14,307 --> 00:07:16,655
I come by this stuffing naturally.
What gave me away?

41
00:07:17,241 --> 00:07:18,510
Dragon's blood.

42
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:22,538
Oh yes, introductions.

43
00:07:22,637 --> 00:07:26,293
Harry, I'd like you to meet
an old friend and colleague of mine--

44
00:07:26,474 --> 00:07:28,110
Horace Slughorn.

45
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:31,683
Horace...
Well you know who this is.

46
00:07:32,978 --> 00:07:35,087
Harry Potter.

47
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:39,903
So for love of theatrics,
Horace...

48
00:07:39,938 --> 00:07:42,200
You're, by any chance,
waiting for someone else, were you?

49
00:07:42,235 --> 00:07:44,082
Someone else?
I'm sure I don't know what you mean.

50
00:07:45,212 --> 00:07:47,322
Alright. The Death Eaters
have been trying

51
00:07:47,352 --> 00:07:48,538
to recruit me
for over a year.

52
00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:49,601
Do you know
what's that like?

53
00:07:49,762 --> 00:07:51,728
You can only say no
to these people so many times.

54
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:53,564
So I never stay anywhere
more than a week.

55
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:56,367
The Muggles who own this place
are in the Canary Islands.

56
00:07:56,402 --> 00:07:58,633
Well, I think we should put it
back in order for them,

57
00:07:58,668 --> 00:07:59,616
- don't you?
- Yes.

58
00:07:59,651 --> 00:08:00,379
Fine.

59
00:08:34,417 --> 00:08:35,518
That was fun.

60
00:08:36,892 --> 00:08:38,094
Do you mind
if I use the loo?

61
00:08:38,129 --> 00:08:39,222
No, of course.

62
00:08:41,123 --> 00:08:43,499
Don't think I don't know
why you're here, Albus.

63
00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:45,319
The answer is still no.

64
00:08:45,354 --> 00:08:48,374
Absolutely,
and unequivanetly, no.

65
00:08:57,057 --> 00:08:58,757
You're very like
your father.

66
00:09:00,198 --> 00:09:01,321
Except the eyes,
of course.

67
00:09:01,356 --> 00:09:02,958
- You have your--
- My mother's eyes, yeah.

68
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:04,744
Lily, lovely Lily.

69
00:09:04,745 --> 00:09:06,439
She's exceedingly bright,
your mother.

70
00:09:06,785 --> 00:09:08,306
Even more impressive
even though I could say

71
00:09:08,341 --> 00:09:09,963
that she was Muggle-born.

72
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,043
One of my best friends
is Muggle-born.

73
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:13,512
- She's the best in our year.
- Oh please don't think

74
00:09:13,547 --> 00:09:14,841
I'm prejudiced.
No, no, no.

75
00:09:14,911 --> 00:09:17,803
Your mother was
one of my absolute favorites.

76
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:20,262
Look, there she is.
Right at the front.

77
00:09:29,098 --> 00:09:31,670
All mine.
Each and every one.

78
00:09:32,034 --> 00:09:33,388
Ex-students, I mean.

79
00:09:36,021 --> 00:09:39,688
You recognise Barnabas Cuffe?
Editor of the Daily Prophet.

80
00:09:41,084 --> 00:09:43,544
Always takes my owl
should I wish to register an opinion

81
00:09:43,579 --> 00:09:44,721
on the news of the day.

82
00:09:45,863 --> 00:09:48,686
Gwenog Jones,
captain of the Holyhead Harpies.

83
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:51,400
Free tickets
whenever I want them.

84
00:09:51,435 --> 00:09:53,631
Of course, I haven't been
to a match in some time.

85
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,977
Ah, yes!
Regulus Black.

86
00:09:59,656 --> 00:10:01,750
No doubt, there is
his older brother Sirius,

87
00:10:01,785 --> 00:10:03,203
died a few weeks ago.

88
00:10:03,652 --> 00:10:06,411
I taught the whole Black family,
except Sirius.

89
00:10:06,446 --> 00:10:07,448
It's a shame.

90
00:10:07,483 --> 00:10:08,486
A talented boy.

91
00:10:08,526 --> 00:10:10,783
I got Regulus when
he came along, of course, but...

92
00:10:11,203 --> 00:10:12,737
but I'd like to set.

93
00:10:14,418 --> 00:10:15,185
Horace!

94
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:17,684
Do you mind if I take this?

95
00:10:22,216 --> 00:10:23,914
I do love
knitting patterns.

96
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:25,767
Yes, of course,
but you're not leaving, are you?

97
00:10:25,802 --> 00:10:28,154
Oh, I think I know
a lost cause when I see one.

98
00:10:28,189 --> 00:10:31,305
Regrettable, I would have considered it
a very personal triumph

99
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,322
if you consented
to return to Hogwarts.

100
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,068
Ah well, you're like my friend
Mr. Potter here.

101
00:10:36,103 --> 00:10:37,474
One of a kind.

102
00:10:37,798 --> 00:10:41,174
Well, bye-bye Horace.
Bye.

103
00:10:51,982 --> 00:10:54,174
Alright. I'll do it.

104
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,019
But I want Professor Merrythought's
old office,

105
00:10:57,049 --> 00:10:59,120
not the water closet
I had before.

106
00:10:59,379 --> 00:11:00,818
And I expect a raise.

107
00:11:00,838 --> 00:11:03,061
These are mad times
we're living, mad!

108
00:11:05,341 --> 00:11:06,474
They are, indeed.

109
00:11:10,196 --> 00:11:11,745
Sir, exactly what was
all that about?

110
00:11:12,389 --> 00:11:14,890
You are talented,
famous and powerful.

111
00:11:14,925 --> 00:11:16,737
Everything Horace values.

112
00:11:16,949 --> 00:11:19,859
Professor Slughorn's gonna try
to collect you, Harry.

113
00:11:20,436 --> 00:11:22,673
You would be
his crowning jewel.

114
00:11:22,854 --> 00:11:24,781
That's why
he's returning to Hogwarts.

115
00:11:25,146 --> 00:11:27,440
And it's crucial
he should return.

116
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:31,811
I fear I may have stolen
a wondrous night from you, Harry.

117
00:11:32,047 --> 00:11:33,722
She was truthfully...

118
00:11:34,013 --> 00:11:35,269
very pretty.

119
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:36,443
The girl.

120
00:11:37,089 --> 00:11:38,026
It's alright, sir.

121
00:11:38,402 --> 00:11:40,470
I'll go back tomorrow,
make some excuse.

122
00:11:40,505 --> 00:11:43,267
Oh you'll not be returning
to Little Whinging tonight, Harry.

123
00:11:44,133 --> 00:11:46,799
But sir, what about Hedwig?
And my trunk?

124
00:11:47,147 --> 00:11:49,264
Both
are waiting for you.

125
00:12:22,011 --> 00:12:22,851
Hedwig?

126
00:12:25,896 --> 00:12:26,847
Mom?

127
00:12:28,486 --> 00:12:29,819
Ginny, what is it?

128
00:12:30,138 --> 00:12:31,989
I was only wondering
when Harry got here.

129
00:12:32,442 --> 00:12:34,633
What?
Harry-- Harry, who?

130
00:12:34,668 --> 00:12:35,820
Harry Potter, of course.

131
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:38,749
I think I'd know if Harry Potter
was in my house, wouldn't I?

132
00:12:38,784 --> 00:12:40,622
His trunk's in the kitchen...
and his owl.

133
00:12:40,657 --> 00:12:42,825
But no, dear.
I seriously doubt that.

134
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:46,293
Harry?
Did someone say Harry?

135
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:48,639
Me, nosey.
Is he up there with you?

136
00:12:48,674 --> 00:12:49,312
Of course not.

137
00:12:49,347 --> 00:12:51,611
I think I'll know if my best friend's
in my room, wouldn't I?

138
00:12:52,027 --> 00:12:53,166
Is that an owl I heard?

139
00:12:53,201 --> 00:12:54,321
You haven't seen him,
have you?

140
00:12:54,499 --> 00:12:56,157
Apparently, he's wandering
about the house.

141
00:12:56,158 --> 00:12:57,805
- Really?
- Really.

142
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:58,953
Harry!

143
00:13:05,485 --> 00:13:06,568
Harry.

144
00:13:09,034 --> 00:13:12,721
What a lovely surprise!

145
00:13:14,235 --> 00:13:16,328
Why didn't you let us know
you were coming?

146
00:13:16,363 --> 00:13:17,742
I didn't know.
Dumbledore.

147
00:13:17,777 --> 00:13:21,000
Oh, that man!
What we won't do without him?

148
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,979
A bit of... toothpaste.

149
00:13:32,173 --> 00:13:33,113
So when did you
get here?

150
00:13:33,627 --> 00:13:34,649
A few days ago.

151
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:38,003
Day or for a while,
I wasn't sure I was coming.

152
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:42,332
Mum...
sort of lost it, last week.

153
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:45,377
Said Ginny and I have
no business going back to Hogwarts.

154
00:13:45,447 --> 00:13:47,013
It's too dangerous.

155
00:13:47,048 --> 00:13:48,243
Oh, come on.

156
00:13:48,258 --> 00:13:49,520
She's not alone.

157
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:51,216
Even my parents.
They're Muggles,

158
00:13:51,251 --> 00:13:52,664
know something
bad's happening.

159
00:13:53,383 --> 00:13:54,909
Anyway,
Dad stepped in.

160
00:13:54,948 --> 00:13:56,384
Told us she was
being barmy and...

161
00:13:57,404 --> 00:13:59,152
Took a few days,
but she came around.

162
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:02,318
But, this is Hogwarts
we're talking about.

163
00:14:02,353 --> 00:14:04,006
It's Dumbledore.
What could be safer?

164
00:14:05,341 --> 00:14:07,572
There's been a lot of talk
recently that...

165
00:14:09,038 --> 00:14:10,544
Dumbledore's
got a bit old.

166
00:14:10,579 --> 00:14:12,252
What rubbish!
Well, he's only...

167
00:14:12,703 --> 00:14:13,697
How old is he?

168
00:14:14,176 --> 00:14:17,836
150?
Give or take a few years?

169
00:14:36,699 --> 00:14:38,621
Cissy, you can't do this!

170
00:14:38,656 --> 00:14:40,096
He can't be trusted.

171
00:14:40,553 --> 00:14:42,018
The Dark Lord trusts him.

172
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:44,103
The Dark Lord is mistaken.

173
00:15:13,751 --> 00:15:15,872
Run along, Wormtail.

174
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:20,398
I-I know
I ought not to be here.

175
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:24,964
The Dark Lord himself
forbade me to speak of this.

176
00:15:25,074 --> 00:15:27,676
If the Dark Lord has forbidden it,
you would not to speak.

177
00:15:27,711 --> 00:15:31,062
Put it down, Bella, we mustn't
touch what isn't ours.

178
00:15:35,722 --> 00:15:39,533
As it, so happens,
I'm aware of your situation, Narcissa.

179
00:15:39,568 --> 00:15:40,349
You?

180
00:15:41,443 --> 00:15:43,595
The Dark Lord told you?

181
00:15:44,338 --> 00:15:46,290
Your sister darts me.

182
00:15:47,911 --> 00:15:50,788
Understandable, over the years,
I've played my part well.

183
00:15:50,848 --> 00:15:54,764
So well, I've deceived one of
the greatest wizards of all time.

184
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:59,476
Dumbledore <i>is</i> a great wizard.
Only a fool would question it.

185
00:15:59,601 --> 00:16:01,461
I don't doubt you, Severus.

186
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:02,805
You should be honored,
Cissy.

187
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:03,941
As should Draco.

188
00:16:08,816 --> 00:16:10,209
He's just a boy.

189
00:16:11,472 --> 00:16:13,606
I can't change
the Dark Lord's mind.

190
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:19,088
But it might be possible
for me to help Draco.

191
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:22,077
Severus.

192
00:16:22,582 --> 00:16:23,466
Swear to it.

193
00:16:27,732 --> 00:16:29,798
Make the Unbreakable Vow.

194
00:16:33,917 --> 00:16:36,396
It's just empty words.

195
00:16:37,026 --> 00:16:42,153
You'll give it his best effort...
when it matters most.

196
00:16:44,189 --> 00:16:47,207
He'll just slither back
to his hole.

197
00:16:51,503 --> 00:16:52,204
Coward.

198
00:16:56,065 --> 00:16:58,865
Take out your wand.

199
00:17:11,891 --> 00:17:18,375
Will you, Severus Snape,
watch over Draco Malfoy

200
00:17:18,411 --> 00:17:22,393
as he attempts to fulfill
the Dark Lord's wishes?

201
00:17:24,006 --> 00:17:24,976
I will.

202
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:30,135
And will you,
to the best of your ability,

203
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,299
protect him from harm?

204
00:17:34,795 --> 00:17:35,780
I will.

205
00:17:38,085 --> 00:17:40,560
And if Draco should fail,

206
00:17:41,634 --> 00:17:46,466
will you yourself
carry out the deed

207
00:17:46,501 --> 00:17:50,349
the Dark Lord has ordered
Draco to perform?

208
00:17:56,011 --> 00:17:57,095
I will.

209
00:18:19,445 --> 00:18:22,384
Step up, step up!
We got fating fancies.

210
00:18:22,419 --> 00:18:24,752
- And he's made me go.
- At just in for time for school.

211
00:18:24,787 --> 00:18:26,049
Puking Pastilles.

212
00:18:27,803 --> 00:18:29,611
Meeting's in the cauldron,
Hanson.

213
00:18:43,882 --> 00:18:46,705
- Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder.
- How real many spinned it at that one?

214
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,300
Handy if you need
to make a quick getaway.

215
00:18:49,126 --> 00:18:51,937
Hello, ladies.
Love potions, eh?

216
00:18:52,655 --> 00:18:54,027
Yeah.
They really do work.

217
00:18:54,062 --> 00:18:55,495
Then again the way
we heard you, sis...

218
00:18:55,513 --> 00:18:57,348
You're doing just fine
on your own.

219
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:58,115
Meaning?

220
00:18:58,265 --> 00:19:00,414
Are you not currently dating
Dean Thomas?

221
00:19:01,136 --> 00:19:02,451
It's none of your business.

222
00:19:08,345 --> 00:19:09,136
How much for this?

223
00:19:09,469 --> 00:19:10,557
- Five galleons.
- Five galleons.

224
00:19:10,959 --> 00:19:11,772
How much for me?

225
00:19:11,789 --> 00:19:13,155
- Five galleons.
- Five galleons.

226
00:19:13,281 --> 00:19:14,107
I'm your brother.

227
00:19:14,656 --> 00:19:15,578
- Ten galleons.
- Ten galleons.

228
00:19:18,373 --> 00:19:19,528
Come on, let's go.

229
00:19:22,355 --> 00:19:23,126
Hi, Ron.

230
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:24,967
Hi.

231
00:19:38,391 --> 00:19:40,048
How are Fred and George
doing it?

232
00:19:40,341 --> 00:19:41,658
Half the alley's
closed down.

233
00:19:42,339 --> 00:19:44,282
Fred reckons people
need a laugh these days.

234
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:46,680
I reckon he's right.

235
00:19:49,252 --> 00:19:50,036
Oh, no.

236
00:19:51,072 --> 00:19:53,347
Everyone got their wands
from Ollivanders.

237
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:05,951
Harry...

238
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:09,542
Is it me
or do Draco and Mummy

239
00:20:09,577 --> 00:20:11,414
look like two people who
don't want to be followed?

240
00:21:52,959 --> 00:21:53,860
<i>Quibbler!</i>

241
00:21:55,767 --> 00:21:56,655
Quibbler.

242
00:21:59,251 --> 00:22:00,428
He's lovely.

243
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,135
They've been known to sing
at Boxing Day, you know?

244
00:22:03,916 --> 00:22:05,594
- Quibbler?
- Oh, please.

245
00:22:07,295 --> 00:22:08,584
What's a Wrackspurt?

246
00:22:08,822 --> 00:22:09,854
Invisible creatures,

247
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:12,163
they flow in your ears
and make your brain go fuzzy.

248
00:22:13,508 --> 00:22:14,430
Quibbler!

249
00:22:25,005 --> 00:22:27,504
So what was Draco doing
with that weird-looking cabinet?

250
00:22:27,773 --> 00:22:29,241
And who were
all those people?

251
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:31,612
Don't you see?
It was a ceremony.

252
00:22:31,837 --> 00:22:33,803
- An initiation.
- Stop it, Harry.

253
00:22:33,889 --> 00:22:35,801
- I know where you're going with this.
- It happened.

254
00:22:36,143 --> 00:22:38,263
- He's one of them.
- One of who?

255
00:22:39,617 --> 00:22:42,865
Harry's under the impression
Draco Malfoy is now a Death Eater.

256
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,127
You're barking.

257
00:22:44,962 --> 00:22:46,964
What would You-Know-Who want
with a sod like Malfoy?

258
00:22:47,213 --> 00:22:49,194
Oh, then what's he doing
in Borgin and Burkes?

259
00:22:49,229 --> 00:22:50,654
Browsing for furniture?

260
00:22:51,496 --> 00:22:53,368
It's a creepy shop.
He's a creepy blood.

261
00:22:53,611 --> 00:22:57,007
Blood? His father is a Death Eater.
It only makes sense.

262
00:22:57,177 --> 00:22:58,872
Besides, Hermione saw it
with her own eyes.

263
00:22:58,907 --> 00:23:01,507
I told you,
I don't know what I saw.

264
00:23:03,551 --> 00:23:04,480
I need some air.

265
00:23:40,576 --> 00:23:42,641
- What's going on?
- What's in that?

266
00:23:44,463 --> 00:23:45,055
What's that?

267
00:23:45,762 --> 00:23:46,435
What is it?

268
00:23:46,907 --> 00:23:47,747
- I don't know.
- What was that?

269
00:23:47,782 --> 00:23:50,229
Relax, boys. It's probably just
a phantom messing around.

270
00:23:50,837 --> 00:23:53,473
Come, Draco. Sit down.
We'll be at Hogwarts soon.

271
00:24:03,345 --> 00:24:06,478
Hogwarts.
What a pathetic excuse for a school.

272
00:24:07,301 --> 00:24:09,188
I think I pitched myself
off the astronomy tab

273
00:24:09,208 --> 00:24:11,083
I thought I had to continue
for another 2 years.

274
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:12,456
What's that supposed
to mean?

275
00:24:13,958 --> 00:24:15,741
Let's just say I don't think
I see me wasting my time

276
00:24:15,776 --> 00:24:17,644
in Charms class
next year.

277
00:24:19,205 --> 00:24:20,683
Amused, Blaise?

278
00:24:22,449 --> 00:24:24,098
Let's see just
who's laughing in the end.

279
00:24:46,199 --> 00:24:47,233
You two go on.

280
00:24:47,785 --> 00:24:49,155
Wanna check something.

281
00:24:51,789 --> 00:24:54,361
- Where's Harry?
- He's probably on the platform.

282
00:24:54,663 --> 00:24:55,250
Come on.

283
00:25:10,973 --> 00:25:14,289
Didn't Mummy ever tell you
it was rude to eavesdrop, Potter?

284
00:25:14,521 --> 00:25:15,446
Petrificus Totalus!

285
00:25:26,764 --> 00:25:27,660
Oh yeah...

286
00:25:28,531 --> 00:25:31,094
She was dead before you could
wipe the drool off your chin.

287
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,220
That's for my father.

288
00:25:38,587 --> 00:25:40,095
Enjoy your ride
back to London.

289
00:26:22,095 --> 00:26:23,096
Ennervate!

290
00:26:29,466 --> 00:26:30,414
Hello, Harry!

291
00:26:30,449 --> 00:26:32,254
Luna.
How'd you know where I was?

292
00:26:32,476 --> 00:26:35,131
Wrapspurts,
your head's full of them.

293
00:26:42,165 --> 00:26:44,641
Sorry I made you miss the carriages,
by the way, Luna.

294
00:26:45,013 --> 00:26:47,824
That's alright.
It was like being with a friend.

295
00:26:48,114 --> 00:26:49,461
Well,
I am your friend, Luna.

296
00:26:50,534 --> 00:26:51,261
That's nice.

297
00:26:51,712 --> 00:26:53,481
Oh, about time.

298
00:26:53,516 --> 00:26:55,202
I've been looking
all over for you two.

299
00:26:55,625 --> 00:26:56,256
Right...

300
00:26:56,928 --> 00:26:57,766
Names?

301
00:26:58,365 --> 00:27:00,543
Professor Flitwick,
you know me for five years.

302
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:02,569
No exceptions, Potter.

303
00:27:03,412 --> 00:27:06,072
- Who are those people?
- Aurors.

304
00:27:06,863 --> 00:27:07,626
Security.

305
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:09,194
What's this cane here then?

306
00:27:09,453 --> 00:27:11,707
It's not a cane, you cretin.
It's a walking stick.

307
00:27:11,708 --> 00:27:13,374
And what exactly will
you be doing with all...

308
00:27:17,998 --> 00:27:19,443
be construed
as an offensive weapon.

309
00:27:19,635 --> 00:27:24,517
It's alright, Mr. Filch.
I can vouch for Mr. Malfoy.

310
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:33,163
Nice face, Potter.

311
00:27:40,053 --> 00:27:41,657
Would you like me
to fix it for you?

312
00:27:42,546 --> 00:27:44,374
Personally, I think
you look a bit more...

313
00:27:44,409 --> 00:27:46,252
devil may care
this way but...

314
00:27:46,292 --> 00:27:47,075
It's up to you.

315
00:27:48,111 --> 00:27:49,514
Well, have you ever
fixed a nose before?

316
00:27:50,514 --> 00:27:52,649
No, but I've done
several toes...

317
00:27:52,956 --> 00:27:54,215
How different
are they really?

318
00:27:55,268 --> 00:27:58,172
Um, okay, yeah.
Give it a go.

319
00:28:01,284 --> 00:28:02,044
Episkey!

320
00:28:09,016 --> 00:28:12,411
- How do I look?
- Exceptionally ordinary.

321
00:28:13,048 --> 00:28:13,897
Brilliant!

322
00:28:21,343 --> 00:28:22,358
Hermione...

323
00:28:22,538 --> 00:28:23,697
I'm here in a minute.

324
00:28:27,296 --> 00:28:31,685
Will you stop eating?
Your best friend is missing.

325
00:28:32,218 --> 00:28:34,808
Why won't you
turn around, you lunatic?

326
00:28:38,291 --> 00:28:39,594
He's covered in blood again.

327
00:28:39,994 --> 00:28:41,526
Why is it
he's always covered in blood?

328
00:28:42,377 --> 00:28:43,700
Looks like it's his own
this time.

329
00:28:44,176 --> 00:28:47,291
Where have you been?
What happened to your face?

330
00:28:47,326 --> 00:28:48,059
Later.

331
00:28:48,919 --> 00:28:49,705
What did I miss?

332
00:28:50,576 --> 00:28:53,914
The Sorting Hat says we ought to be
brave and strong in these trouble times.

333
00:28:54,517 --> 00:28:57,236
Easy for it to say, though.
It's a hat, isn't it?

334
00:29:05,769 --> 00:29:07,873
- Very best of evenings to you all.
- Thanks.

335
00:29:10,483 --> 00:29:14,469
First off, let me introduce
the newest member of our staff.

336
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:16,726
Horace Slughorn.

337
00:29:20,872 --> 00:29:24,954
Professor Slughorn, I'm happy to say,
has agreed to resume his old post...

338
00:29:25,054 --> 00:29:26,664
as Potions Master.

339
00:29:27,152 --> 00:29:29,883
Meanwhile, the post of
Defense Against the Dark Arts...

340
00:29:30,095 --> 00:29:32,254
will be taken by
Professor Snape.

341
00:29:39,472 --> 00:29:41,843
As you know,
each and every one of you

342
00:29:41,878 --> 00:29:44,133
were searched
upon your arrival here tonight.

343
00:29:44,837 --> 00:29:46,383
And you have the right
to know why.

344
00:29:47,409 --> 00:29:49,625
Once,
there was a young man.

345
00:29:49,973 --> 00:29:52,978
Like you,
sat in this very hall.

346
00:29:53,777 --> 00:29:55,899
Walked this castle's corridors.

347
00:29:56,309 --> 00:29:57,794
Slept under it's roof.

348
00:29:58,546 --> 00:30:02,502
You see, to all the world,
a student like any other.

349
00:30:03,084 --> 00:30:04,159
His name:

350
00:30:06,188 --> 00:30:07,533
Tom Riddle.

351
00:30:12,454 --> 00:30:17,208
Today of course, is known
all over the world by another name.

352
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:20,686
Which is why
as I stand,

353
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:23,254
looking out
upon you all tonight,

354
00:30:24,057 --> 00:30:26,168
I'm reminded
of a sobering fact.

355
00:30:27,426 --> 00:30:32,054
Every day, every hour,
this very minute, perhaps...

356
00:30:32,551 --> 00:30:36,226
dark forces attempt
to penetrate this castle's walls.

357
00:30:38,156 --> 00:30:41,785
But in the end,
that greatest weapon...

358
00:30:42,409 --> 00:30:43,095
is you.

359
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:47,762
Just something
to think about.

360
00:30:49,732 --> 00:30:51,064
Now off to bed,
beep beep.

361
00:30:52,724 --> 00:30:53,908
That was cheerful.

362
00:30:59,829 --> 00:31:03,282
History of Magic is upstairs,
ladies, not down.

363
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:09,344
Mr. Davis, Mr. Davis,
that is the girls' lavatory.

364
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:13,332
Potter.

365
00:31:15,102 --> 00:31:16,334
Oh, this can't be good.

366
00:31:20,118 --> 00:31:21,646
Enjoying ourselves,
are we?

367
00:31:22,336 --> 00:31:24,085
I had a free period
this morning, Professor.

368
00:31:24,085 --> 00:31:25,073
So I noticed.

369
00:31:25,775 --> 00:31:28,118
I would think you would want
to fill it with Potions.

370
00:31:28,367 --> 00:31:31,031
Or is it no longer your ambition
to become an Auror?

371
00:31:31,424 --> 00:31:34,989
Well, it was, but I was told to have
to get an Outstanding in my O.W.L.

372
00:31:35,024 --> 00:31:38,255
So you did, when Professor Snape
was teaching Potions.

373
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:40,836
However, Professor Slughorn's
perfectly happy

374
00:31:40,871 --> 00:31:44,745
to accept N.E.W.T. students
with "Exceeds Expectations".

375
00:31:44,886 --> 00:31:47,789
Brilliant, um...
Well, I'll head there straight away.

376
00:31:47,824 --> 00:31:48,802
Oh, good, good.

377
00:31:49,228 --> 00:31:53,211
Potter, take Weasley with you.
He looks far too happy over there.

378
00:31:55,752 --> 00:31:56,956
I don't want
to take Potions.

379
00:31:56,991 --> 00:31:58,922
There's Quidditch trials coming up,
I need to practice.

380
00:32:00,894 --> 00:32:05,171
Attention to detail in the preparation
is the prerequisite of all plan.

381
00:32:08,167 --> 00:32:09,763
Harry, my boy,
I've been beginning to worry.

382
00:32:10,172 --> 00:32:11,882
You brought someone
with us, I see.

383
00:32:12,289 --> 00:32:13,598
Ron Weasley, sir.

384
00:32:14,058 --> 00:32:16,568
But I'm dead awful at Potions.
A menace, actually so.

385
00:32:16,603 --> 00:32:17,505
I'm probably just gonna--

386
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:18,895
Nonsense,
we'll sort you out.

387
00:32:18,916 --> 00:32:20,754
Any friend of Harry's
is a friend of mine.

388
00:32:20,755 --> 00:32:21,373
Get your books out.

389
00:32:21,758 --> 00:32:24,394
I'm sorry, sir, I haven't actually
got my book yet and nor is Ron.

390
00:32:24,546 --> 00:32:26,136
Not to worry,
get what you want from the cupboard.

391
00:32:26,208 --> 00:32:27,268
Now as I was saying,

392
00:32:27,308 --> 00:32:29,555
I prepared some concoctions
this morning.

393
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:33,539
Any ideas
what these might be?

394
00:32:34,927 --> 00:32:36,715
- Yes, Miss...?
- Granger, sir.

395
00:32:40,574 --> 00:32:42,556
That one there is
Veritaserum.

396
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:44,547
It's a truth-telling serum.

397
00:32:45,069 --> 00:32:46,567
And that one--

398
00:32:51,401 --> 00:32:53,942
It's terribly tricky to make.
This is Amortentia.

399
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:56,583
The most powerful
love potion in the world.

400
00:32:57,921 --> 00:32:59,823
It's rumored to smell differently
to each person

401
00:32:59,863 --> 00:33:01,212
according to
what attracts them.

402
00:33:03,001 --> 00:33:04,661
For example, I smell...

403
00:33:05,642 --> 00:33:08,890
Freshly mown grass
and new parchment and...

404
00:33:09,748 --> 00:33:12,531
Spearmint toothpaste.

405
00:33:14,329 --> 00:33:17,031
Now Amortentia
doesn't create actual love.

406
00:33:17,072 --> 00:33:17,743
That would be impossible,

407
00:33:17,783 --> 00:33:22,534
but it does cause
powerful infatuation or obsession.

408
00:33:22,535 --> 00:33:23,963
And for that reason,

409
00:33:24,283 --> 00:33:29,037
it is probably the most
dangerous potion in this room.

410
00:33:34,646 --> 00:33:37,262
Sir, you haven't told us
what's in that one.

411
00:33:37,434 --> 00:33:41,776
Oh yes. What you see before you,
ladies and gentlemen,

412
00:33:41,877 --> 00:33:44,096
is a curious little potion,

413
00:33:44,708 --> 00:33:46,594
known as Felix Felicis.

414
00:33:47,534 --> 00:33:49,897
But it is more commonly known
referred to as--

415
00:33:49,917 --> 00:33:52,341
- Liquid luck.
- Yes, Miss Granger.

416
00:33:52,752 --> 00:33:54,630
Liquid luck.

417
00:33:55,291 --> 00:33:58,377
Desperately tricky to make,
disastrous should you get it wrong.

418
00:33:58,967 --> 00:34:03,480
One sip and you'll find
that all of your endeavours succeed.

419
00:34:05,717 --> 00:34:07,928
At least
until the effects wear off.

420
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:12,276
So this is what I offer
each of you today.

421
00:34:12,601 --> 00:34:16,018
One tiny vial of liquid luck
to the student

422
00:34:16,053 --> 00:34:18,525
who in the hour that remains,
manages to brew

423
00:34:18,565 --> 00:34:21,485
an acceptable
Draught of Living Dead.

424
00:34:22,268 --> 00:34:24,992
Recipes for which can be found
on page 10 of your books.

425
00:34:25,286 --> 00:34:26,914
Issue one doubt, however.

426
00:34:26,949 --> 00:34:29,287
Only one set of student
manage to brew a potion

427
00:34:29,322 --> 00:34:31,542
of sufficient quality
to claim this prize.

428
00:34:33,081 --> 00:34:35,082
Nevertheless,
good luck to you all.

429
00:34:35,841 --> 00:34:37,362
Let the brewing commence.

430
00:35:12,282 --> 00:35:13,250
How did you do that?

431
00:35:14,525 --> 00:35:15,991
You crush it,
don't cut it.

432
00:35:16,674 --> 00:35:19,240
No, the instructions
specifically says to cut.

433
00:35:19,275 --> 00:35:20,377
No, really.

434
00:35:56,908 --> 00:35:58,833
Merlin's beard!

435
00:35:58,834 --> 00:36:00,207
It is perfect!

436
00:36:01,282 --> 00:36:03,833
So perfect I'd just say
one drop would kill us all!

437
00:36:07,586 --> 00:36:09,595
Here we are then,
as promised.

438
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:12,569
One vial of Felix Felicis.

439
00:36:12,719 --> 00:36:14,470
Congratulations.

440
00:36:15,218 --> 00:36:17,471
Use it well.

441
00:36:44,253 --> 00:36:45,888
Oh Harry,
you got my message?

442
00:36:46,039 --> 00:36:46,648
Come in.

443
00:36:48,509 --> 00:36:49,248
How are you?

444
00:36:49,930 --> 00:36:50,853
I'm fine, sir.

445
00:36:51,815 --> 00:36:53,152
Enjoying your classes?

446
00:36:54,221 --> 00:36:56,533
I know Professor Slughorn
is most impressed with you.

447
00:36:57,832 --> 00:36:59,913
I think he overestimates
my abilities, sir.

448
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,213
Do you?

449
00:37:02,117 --> 00:37:02,920
Definitely.

450
00:37:05,334 --> 00:37:07,710
What about your activities
outside the classroom?

451
00:37:09,063 --> 00:37:09,751
Sir?

452
00:37:09,927 --> 00:37:13,677
Well, I notice you've spent
a great deal of time with Miss Granger.

453
00:37:14,003 --> 00:37:15,356
I can't help wondering if--

454
00:37:15,377 --> 00:37:16,759
Oh, no, no, I mean...

455
00:37:17,194 --> 00:37:18,823
She's brilliant
and we're friends.

456
00:37:19,112 --> 00:37:20,731
- But no.
- Forgive me.

457
00:37:21,077 --> 00:37:22,676
I was only being curious.

458
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:25,626
But enough chit-chat.

459
00:37:26,115 --> 00:37:29,036
You must be wondering
why I summoned you here tonight.

460
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:32,319
The answer lies here.

461
00:37:33,923 --> 00:37:35,463
What you're looking at
are memories.

462
00:37:36,162 --> 00:37:38,480
In this case,
pertaining to one individual:

463
00:37:38,645 --> 00:37:39,600
Voldemort.

464
00:37:40,034 --> 00:37:42,382
Or as he was known, then:
Tom Riddle.

465
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:48,048
This vial contains
the most sufficient memory.

466
00:37:49,081 --> 00:37:50,870
On the day
I first met him.

467
00:37:52,546 --> 00:37:55,115
I'd like you to see it.
If you want.

468
00:38:31,318 --> 00:38:35,226
I'm to admit to some confusion for
receiving your letter, Mr. Dumbledore.

469
00:38:35,673 --> 00:38:38,840
In all the years Tom's been here,
he's never once had a family visitor.

470
00:38:38,841 --> 00:38:41,367
There have been incidents
with the other children--

471
00:38:41,397 --> 00:38:42,871
Nasty things.

472
00:38:45,170 --> 00:38:46,899
Tom, you have a visitor.

473
00:38:47,845 --> 00:38:48,827
How'd you do, Tom?

474
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:57,244
Don't.

475
00:39:05,271 --> 00:39:06,674
You're the doctor,
aren't you?

476
00:39:06,928 --> 00:39:09,868
No, I'm a professor.

477
00:39:10,956 --> 00:39:12,220
I don't believe you.

478
00:39:13,022 --> 00:39:14,320
She wants me
looked at.

479
00:39:15,321 --> 00:39:17,708
They think I'm...
different.

480
00:39:17,743 --> 00:39:18,942
Or perhaps they're right.

481
00:39:19,348 --> 00:39:20,653
I'm not mad.

482
00:39:20,879 --> 00:39:23,528
Hogwarts is not a place
for mad people.

483
00:39:24,203 --> 00:39:25,717
Hogwarts is a school.

484
00:39:26,813 --> 00:39:28,120
School of magic.

485
00:39:32,345 --> 00:39:34,395
You can do things,
can't you, Tom?

486
00:39:36,036 --> 00:39:38,369
Things other children can't.

487
00:39:39,878 --> 00:39:42,045
I can make things move
without touching them.

488
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:46,493
I can make animals do
what I want without training them.

489
00:39:47,738 --> 00:39:50,593
I can make bad things happen
to people who mean to me.

490
00:39:51,879 --> 00:39:53,218
Can make them hurt.

491
00:39:54,284 --> 00:39:55,293
If I want.

492
00:39:56,217 --> 00:39:57,301
Who are you?

493
00:39:58,078 --> 00:39:59,590
Well, I'm like you, Tom.

494
00:40:01,249 --> 00:40:02,553
I'm different.

495
00:40:03,638 --> 00:40:04,658
Prove it.

496
00:40:12,452 --> 00:40:14,132
I think there's something
in your wardrobe

497
00:40:14,153 --> 00:40:15,345
trying to get out, Tom.

498
00:40:25,436 --> 00:40:28,125
Thievery is not tolerated
at Hogwarts, Tom.

499
00:40:29,187 --> 00:40:33,899
At Hogwarts, we'll be taught not only
how to use magic, but how to control it.

500
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:35,945
You understand me?

501
00:40:39,791 --> 00:40:41,493
I can speak to snakes too.

502
00:40:43,422 --> 00:40:44,574
They find me.

503
00:40:46,014 --> 00:40:50,453
Whisper things.
Is that normal for someone like me?

504
00:41:11,358 --> 00:41:14,440
Did you know, sir,
then?

505
00:41:14,728 --> 00:41:18,141
Did I know I just met the most
dangerous dark wizard of all time?

506
00:41:18,712 --> 00:41:19,378
No.

507
00:41:20,846 --> 00:41:22,280
If I had, I...

508
00:41:24,307 --> 00:41:26,128
Over time
while here at Hogwarts,

509
00:41:26,714 --> 00:41:29,483
Tom Riddle grew close
to one particular teacher.

510
00:41:30,122 --> 00:41:31,797
Can you guess
who that teacher might be?

511
00:41:34,702 --> 00:41:38,207
You didn't bring Professor Slughorn back
simply to teach potions, did you, sir?

512
00:41:38,231 --> 00:41:39,491
No, I did not.

513
00:41:40,212 --> 00:41:44,139
You see, Professor Slughorn possesses
something that I desire very dearly.

514
00:41:44,948 --> 00:41:46,520
He will not
give it out easily.

515
00:41:46,888 --> 00:41:49,435
You said Professor Slughorn
would try to collect to me.

516
00:41:49,983 --> 00:41:51,050
I did.

517
00:41:52,178 --> 00:41:53,449
Do you want me
to let him?

518
00:41:55,211 --> 00:41:56,227
Yes.

519
00:43:19,277 --> 00:43:20,473
Okay,
so this morning,

520
00:43:20,494 --> 00:43:22,361
I'm gonna be putting you all
for a few drills

521
00:43:22,396 --> 00:43:23,820
just to assess you
straight.

522
00:43:24,948 --> 00:43:26,346
Quiet, please!

523
00:43:27,066 --> 00:43:28,023
Shut it!

524
00:43:31,788 --> 00:43:32,570
Thanks.

525
00:43:32,961 --> 00:43:35,416
Alright, um,
now then, remember,

526
00:43:35,451 --> 00:43:36,765
just because you made
the team last year

527
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,587
does not guarantee you
a spot this year.

528
00:43:38,622 --> 00:43:39,494
Is that clear?

529
00:43:42,022 --> 00:43:42,689
Good.

530
00:43:51,610 --> 00:43:53,121
No hard feelings, Weasley,
alright?

531
00:43:54,196 --> 00:43:55,495
Hard feelings?

532
00:43:55,570 --> 00:43:56,940
Yeah, I'll be going out
for Keeper's, well,

533
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:58,545
It's...
nothing personal.

534
00:43:59,197 --> 00:44:00,043
Really?

535
00:44:00,527 --> 00:44:01,605
Such a big guy like you?

536
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:03,722
You've got more of a Beater's build,
don't you think?

537
00:44:04,432 --> 00:44:06,663
Keepers need
to be quick, agile.

538
00:44:08,177 --> 00:44:09,503
I'll have my chances.

539
00:44:10,115 --> 00:44:13,268
Say, um, you think you could
introduce me to your friend, Granger?

540
00:44:13,836 --> 00:44:16,202
Wouldn't mind, eh,
getting on a first-hand base,

541
00:44:16,253 --> 00:44:17,209
you know
what I mean?

542
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:31,529
Come on, come on.

543
00:44:37,354 --> 00:44:38,744
Go, Cormac.

544
00:44:54,623 --> 00:44:55,864
Come on, Ron!

545
00:45:06,776 --> 00:45:07,793
Come on, Ron.

546
00:45:25,798 --> 00:45:26,704
Confundus.

547
00:45:42,468 --> 00:45:43,885
He's brilliant.

548
00:45:47,205 --> 00:45:49,769
I have to admit I thought
I was going to miss that last one.

549
00:45:50,894 --> 00:45:52,872
I hope Cormac's
not taking it too hard.

550
00:45:54,062 --> 00:45:56,340
He's got a bit of a thing for you,
Hermione-- Cormac.

551
00:45:58,037 --> 00:45:58,947
He's vile.

552
00:46:04,524 --> 00:46:07,004
Have you ever heard of the spell:
Sectumsempra?

553
00:46:07,130 --> 00:46:08,387
No, I haven't.

554
00:46:09,096 --> 00:46:11,483
If you had a shred of self-respect,
you'd hand that book in.

555
00:46:12,261 --> 00:46:13,446
Not bloody likely.

556
00:46:13,701 --> 00:46:16,141
He's top of the class.
He's even better than you, Hermione.

557
00:46:16,658 --> 00:46:17,995
Slughorn thinks
he's a genius.

558
00:46:21,894 --> 00:46:23,508
I'd like to know
who's that book was.

559
00:46:23,878 --> 00:46:25,281
- Let's have a look, shall we?
- No.

560
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:28,517
Why not?

561
00:46:29,167 --> 00:46:30,575
The binding is fragile.

562
00:46:30,999 --> 00:46:32,848
"The binding is fragile"?

563
00:46:32,883 --> 00:46:33,411
Yeah.

564
00:46:37,788 --> 00:46:39,365
- Who's the Half-Blood Prince?
- Who?

565
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:40,662
That's what it says
right here.

566
00:46:40,696 --> 00:46:42,428
This book is property
of the Half-Blood Prince.

567
00:46:59,702 --> 00:47:01,601
<i>For weeks,
you carry around this book.</i>

568
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:03,968
<i>Practically, sleep with it,
and yet you have no desire</i>

569
00:47:04,008 --> 00:47:05,253
<i>to find out
who the Half-Blood Prince is.</i>

570
00:47:05,294 --> 00:47:08,505
I didn't say I wasn't curious
and I don't sleep with it.

571
00:47:08,848 --> 00:47:09,519
Well, it's true.

572
00:47:09,815 --> 00:47:11,458
Well, I got a nice chat
before I go to bed.

573
00:47:11,467 --> 00:47:14,989
And all you do is that bloody book.
It's like being with Hermione.

574
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:19,474
Well, I was curious
So, I went to--

575
00:47:19,509 --> 00:47:20,402
- The library?
- The library?

576
00:47:20,473 --> 00:47:21,159
And?

577
00:47:22,834 --> 00:47:25,663
And nothing.
I couldn't find a reference

578
00:47:25,698 --> 00:47:27,512
anywhere
to the Half-Blood Prince.

579
00:47:27,547 --> 00:47:28,811
There we go.
That settles it, then.

580
00:47:28,812 --> 00:47:29,799
Yeah, uh...

581
00:47:29,834 --> 00:47:31,776
hoping to find you
in the Three Broomsticks.

582
00:47:31,811 --> 00:47:36,327
Uh no, emergency choir practice
from the freighthorse.

583
00:47:40,016 --> 00:47:41,439
Does anyone fancy
a butterbeer?

584
00:47:42,308 --> 00:47:44,965
A chum of mine
was sledging down Clagsby Hill.

585
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,556
We had a very long, home-made
Norwegian style sledge.

586
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:51,010
We hurtled down,
we hit what most...

587
00:47:51,554 --> 00:47:52,659
Ron, sit aside me.

588
00:47:54,506 --> 00:47:55,393
Okay.

589
00:47:57,428 --> 00:47:58,253
Something to drink?

590
00:47:59,078 --> 00:48:00,990
Three butterbeers
and some ginger in mine, please.

591
00:48:12,517 --> 00:48:13,795
Oh, bloody hell.

592
00:48:19,124 --> 00:48:21,079
Ron, see they're only
holding hands.

593
00:48:24,528 --> 00:48:25,575
And snogging.

594
00:48:26,375 --> 00:48:28,414
- I'd like to leave.
- What?

595
00:48:29,501 --> 00:48:30,912
You can't be serious.

596
00:48:31,158 --> 00:48:33,198
- <i>That</i> happens to be my sister.
- So?

597
00:48:33,733 --> 00:48:35,209
What if she looked at me
and saw you snogging me?

598
00:48:35,244 --> 00:48:36,861
Would you expect her
to get up and leave?

599
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:41,261
- Hey, my boy.
- So wonderful to see you.

600
00:48:41,296 --> 00:48:43,141
And you, and you.

601
00:48:43,142 --> 00:48:44,095
So what brings you here?

602
00:48:44,145 --> 00:48:48,682
Oh, Three Broomsticks and I go way back
further than I care to admit.

603
00:48:49,672 --> 00:48:53,242
I could remember
when it was One Broomstick.

604
00:48:53,277 --> 00:48:54,630
All hands on deck, Granger.

605
00:48:54,761 --> 00:48:55,469
Listen, my boy,

606
00:48:55,811 --> 00:48:59,705
in the old days, I used to throw together
the occassional supper party.

607
00:49:00,061 --> 00:49:01,921
Select a student
or two.

608
00:49:02,154 --> 00:49:03,353
Would you be game?

609
00:49:04,219 --> 00:49:05,618
I consider it
an honor, sir.

610
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:08,846
You'd be welcome too,
Granger.

611
00:49:10,246 --> 00:49:12,186
- I'd be delighted, sir.
- Splendid!

612
00:49:12,573 --> 00:49:14,099
Look for my owl.

613
00:49:15,782 --> 00:49:17,513
Good to see you, Wallenby.

614
00:49:22,279 --> 00:49:23,395
What are you playing at?

615
00:49:25,588 --> 00:49:27,486
Dumbledore's asked me
to get to know him.

616
00:49:28,122 --> 00:49:29,417
- Get to know him?
- Dunno.

617
00:49:30,042 --> 00:49:31,263
It must be important.

618
00:49:31,462 --> 00:49:33,000
If it wasn't,
Dumbledore wouldn't ask.

619
00:49:38,449 --> 00:49:40,256
You got a little bit...

620
00:49:51,953 --> 00:49:53,167
Katie, we don't know
what it could be.

621
00:49:53,444 --> 00:49:55,050
- Harry, what...
- I know what I'm doing.

622
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:55,915
Did you hear
what she was saying

623
00:49:55,964 --> 00:49:57,664
back in the pub there
on me and her snogging?

624
00:50:07,159 --> 00:50:10,090
I warned her.
I warned her not to touch it.

625
00:50:30,571 --> 00:50:31,757
Don't get any closer!

626
00:50:32,516 --> 00:50:33,774
Get back, all of you.

627
00:50:37,502 --> 00:50:38,607
Oh no, no, no.

628
00:50:45,008 --> 00:50:48,025
Do not touch that,
except for the wrappings.

629
00:50:48,307 --> 00:50:49,477
Do you understand?

630
00:51:02,965 --> 00:51:05,594
You're sure Katie did not have this
in her possession

631
00:51:05,614 --> 00:51:07,593
when she entered
the Three Broomsticks?

632
00:51:08,462 --> 00:51:09,460
It's like I said.

633
00:51:10,330 --> 00:51:11,724
She left to go to the loo.

634
00:51:12,217 --> 00:51:14,469
And when she came back,
she had the package.

635
00:51:16,288 --> 00:51:18,601
She said it was important
that she deliver it.

636
00:51:19,510 --> 00:51:22,282
- Did she say to whom?
- To Professor Dumbledore.

637
00:51:23,216 --> 00:51:25,198
Very well. Thank you, Leanne.
You may go.

638
00:51:30,229 --> 00:51:32,811
Why is it
when something happens,

639
00:51:32,846 --> 00:51:35,547
it is always you three?

640
00:51:36,646 --> 00:51:37,800
Believe me, Professor,

641
00:51:37,835 --> 00:51:40,287
I've been asking myself
the same question for six years.

642
00:51:41,341 --> 00:51:42,619
Oh, Severus.

643
00:51:48,564 --> 00:51:49,525
What do you think?

644
00:51:52,133 --> 00:51:56,297
I think Ms. Bell
is lucky to be alive.

645
00:51:57,024 --> 00:51:58,380
She was cursed,
wasn't she?

646
00:51:59,203 --> 00:51:59,973
I know Katie.

647
00:52:00,008 --> 00:52:01,887
Off the Quidditch pitch,
she wouldn't hurt a fly.

648
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:04,147
If she was delivering that
to Professor Dumbledore,

649
00:52:04,182 --> 00:52:05,690
she wasn't doing it
knowingly.

650
00:52:05,824 --> 00:52:07,304
Yes, she was cursed.

651
00:52:08,413 --> 00:52:09,278
It was Malfoy.

652
00:52:12,150 --> 00:52:14,869
That is a very
serious accusation, Potter.

653
00:52:15,667 --> 00:52:19,165
Indeed.
Your evidence?

654
00:52:19,726 --> 00:52:20,738
I just know.

655
00:52:21,961 --> 00:52:26,140
You "just" know.

656
00:52:29,273 --> 00:52:31,361
Once again, you're astonished
with your gifts, Potter.

657
00:52:31,396 --> 00:52:34,895
Gifts mere mortals can only
dream of possessing.

658
00:52:34,935 --> 00:52:40,530
How grand it must be
to be the Chosen One.

659
00:52:45,851 --> 00:52:47,737
I suggest you go back
to your dormitories.

660
00:52:47,772 --> 00:52:48,607
All of you.

661
00:52:58,914 --> 00:53:00,986
What do you suppose
Dean sees in her-- Ginny?

662
00:53:03,270 --> 00:53:04,677
And what does
she see in him?

663
00:53:05,330 --> 00:53:07,547
Dean--
He's brilliant.

664
00:53:07,582 --> 00:53:09,900
You called him slick git
not five hours ago.

665
00:53:10,523 --> 00:53:12,925
Yeah, well, he was running
his hands all over my sister,

666
00:53:12,975 --> 00:53:13,590
wasn't he?

667
00:53:14,256 --> 00:53:16,768
Something snaps.
You've got to hate him, you know?

668
00:53:17,565 --> 00:53:18,601
Old principle.

669
00:53:19,344 --> 00:53:20,178
I suppose.

670
00:53:21,956 --> 00:53:23,361
So what do you think
he sees in her?

671
00:53:23,531 --> 00:53:24,403
I don't know.

672
00:53:25,726 --> 00:53:29,519
She's smart,
funny, attractive--

673
00:53:29,881 --> 00:53:30,946
Attractive?

674
00:53:32,511 --> 00:53:34,137
You know,
she's got nice skin.

675
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:38,674
Skin? You're saying Dean's
dating my sister because of her skin?

676
00:53:38,709 --> 00:53:40,691
For blood, I mean.
I'm just--I'm just saying

677
00:53:40,721 --> 00:53:42,438
it could be
a contributing factor.

678
00:53:46,096 --> 00:53:47,633
Hermione's got nice skin.

679
00:53:48,578 --> 00:53:50,470
When you say it,
as skin goes, I mean.

680
00:53:52,095 --> 00:53:53,622
I've never really
thought about it.

681
00:53:54,393 --> 00:53:56,718
But I suppose, yeah.

682
00:53:57,822 --> 00:53:58,912
Very nice.

683
00:54:03,284 --> 00:54:05,230
I think
I'll be going to sleep now.

684
00:54:05,469 --> 00:54:06,383
Right.

685
00:54:16,401 --> 00:54:19,787
So tell me, Cormac, do you see anything
of your uncle Tiberius these days?

686
00:54:20,141 --> 00:54:23,109
Yes, sir, in fact I'm meant
to get hunting with him

687
00:54:23,139 --> 00:54:24,713
and the Minister of Magic
over the holidays.

688
00:54:24,748 --> 00:54:27,765
Oh, well, be sure
to give them both my best.

689
00:54:28,061 --> 00:54:29,874
And what about
your uncle, Belby?

690
00:54:30,135 --> 00:54:31,138
For those of you
who don't know well,

691
00:54:31,188 --> 00:54:33,739
Marcus' uncle invented
the Wolfsbane Potion.

692
00:54:33,740 --> 00:54:35,143
Is he working
on anything new?

693
00:54:35,178 --> 00:54:35,870
I don't know.

694
00:54:36,418 --> 00:54:37,763
He and my dad
don't get along.

695
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:39,968
'Prolly cause my dad
says potions are rubbish.

696
00:54:40,851 --> 00:54:43,610
His only potion worth having
is a stiff one at the end of the day.

697
00:54:43,670 --> 00:54:44,902
And what about you,
Ms. Granger,

698
00:54:44,922 --> 00:54:48,112
what exactly does your family do
in the Muggle world?

699
00:54:49,752 --> 00:54:51,093
My parents are dentists.

700
00:54:55,536 --> 00:54:56,889
They attend to people's teeth.

701
00:54:56,924 --> 00:54:58,089
Fascinating.

702
00:54:59,130 --> 00:55:01,781
And is that considered
a dangerous profession?

703
00:55:01,816 --> 00:55:02,422
No.

704
00:55:04,812 --> 00:55:09,301
Although, one boy, Robby Fenwich,
did bite my father once.

705
00:55:09,336 --> 00:55:10,857
He needed ten stitches.

706
00:55:16,765 --> 00:55:19,508
Ah, Ms. Weasley.
Come in, come in.

707
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:25,344
Look, her eyes.
They've been fighting again.

708
00:55:25,671 --> 00:55:26,583
Her and Dean.

709
00:55:27,059 --> 00:55:28,747
Sorry,
I'm not usually late.

710
00:55:33,208 --> 00:55:35,640
No matter,
just in time for dessert.

711
00:55:35,892 --> 00:55:37,764
That is if Belby
has left you any.

712
00:55:45,151 --> 00:55:47,132
- What?
- Nothing.

713
00:55:53,958 --> 00:55:54,922
Goodbye.

714
00:55:55,716 --> 00:55:56,783
Bye-bye.

715
00:56:02,043 --> 00:56:02,732
Potter!

716
00:56:02,767 --> 00:56:06,475
I'm sorry, sir, I was
just admiring your hourglass.

717
00:56:07,612 --> 00:56:11,187
Ah yes,
most intriguing object.

718
00:56:12,214 --> 00:56:15,614
The sand runs in accordance
with the quality of the conversation.

719
00:56:16,479 --> 00:56:19,036
It is stimulating,
the sand runs slowly.

720
00:56:20,250 --> 00:56:22,377
- If it is not...
- I think I'll be going, then.

721
00:56:22,412 --> 00:56:23,106
Nonsense.

722
00:56:23,588 --> 00:56:25,266
You have nothing
to fear, dear boy.

723
00:56:25,604 --> 00:56:27,303
Actually,
some of your classmates...

724
00:56:27,757 --> 00:56:30,679
Well, let's just say
they're unlikely to make the shelf.

725
00:56:31,291 --> 00:56:32,290
Shelf, sir?

726
00:56:33,417 --> 00:56:36,709
Anyone who aspires to be anyone
hopes to end up here.

727
00:56:37,169 --> 00:56:42,137
But then again, you already
are someone, aren't you, Harry?

728
00:56:42,172 --> 00:56:43,887
Did Voldemort
ever make the shelf, sir?

729
00:56:46,326 --> 00:56:47,925
You knew him, didn't you, sir?
Tom Riddle?

730
00:56:48,405 --> 00:56:49,379
You were his teacher.

731
00:56:50,847 --> 00:56:54,162
Mr. Riddle had a number of teachers
who was here at Hogwarts.

732
00:56:54,335 --> 00:56:55,415
What was he like?

733
00:56:59,437 --> 00:57:01,176
I'm sorry, sir.
Forgive me.

734
00:57:02,471 --> 00:57:03,936
He killed my parents.

735
00:57:06,861 --> 00:57:10,595
Of course, it's only natural
you should want to know more.

736
00:57:13,227 --> 00:57:15,500
But I'm afraid
I must disappoint you, Harry.

737
00:57:16,887 --> 00:57:18,435
When I first met
young Mr. Riddle,

738
00:57:18,470 --> 00:57:20,476
he was a quiet,
albeit brilliant boy,

739
00:57:20,505 --> 00:57:22,760
committed to becoming
a first-grade wizard.

740
00:57:23,611 --> 00:57:25,231
Not unlike
others I've known.

741
00:57:25,730 --> 00:57:27,351
Not unlike yourself,
in fact.

742
00:57:28,860 --> 00:57:33,140
If the monster existed,
it was very deep within.

743
00:57:50,203 --> 00:57:51,233
You okay, Ron?

744
00:57:55,661 --> 00:57:58,489
I'm counting on you, Ron.
I've 2 games on Gryffindor, ya?

745
00:57:58,524 --> 00:58:01,097
- Be good, Ron.
- Loser!

746
00:58:02,644 --> 00:58:03,658
What's he wearing?

747
00:58:12,811 --> 00:58:16,619
- So how was it, then?
- How is what?

748
00:58:16,654 --> 00:58:19,416
- Your dinner party?
- Pretty boring actually.

749
00:58:20,455 --> 00:58:22,096
But I think
Harry enjoyed dessert.

750
00:58:26,084 --> 00:58:28,023
Slughorn's having Christmas,
do you know?

751
00:58:28,871 --> 00:58:30,022
I'm about to bring someone.

752
00:58:30,162 --> 00:58:31,808
I expect
you'll be bringing McLaggen.

753
00:58:32,029 --> 00:58:33,245
He's in the Slug Club,
isn't he?

754
00:58:34,137 --> 00:58:35,545
Actually,
I was going to ask you.

755
00:58:35,949 --> 00:58:36,823
Really?

756
00:58:39,543 --> 00:58:40,903
Good luck today, Ron.

757
00:58:42,215 --> 00:58:44,126
I know
you'll be brilliant.

758
00:58:47,493 --> 00:58:48,425
I'm resigning.

759
00:58:48,797 --> 00:58:51,176
After today's match,
McLaggen can have my spot.

760
00:58:51,211 --> 00:58:52,024
Are you alright?

761
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:54,861
- Juice?
- Sure.

762
00:58:55,357 --> 00:58:56,387
Hello, everyone.

763
00:58:58,228 --> 00:58:59,937
You look dreadful, Ron.

764
00:59:00,322 --> 00:59:02,039
Is that why you put
something in his cup?

765
00:59:04,697 --> 00:59:05,854
Is it a tonic?

766
00:59:09,712 --> 00:59:10,669
Liquid luck.

767
00:59:12,565 --> 00:59:13,671
Don't drink it, Ron.

768
00:59:21,403 --> 00:59:23,799
- You could be expelled for that.
- What are we talking about?

769
00:59:26,788 --> 00:59:28,564
Come on, Harry,
we've got a game to win.

770
01:00:46,734 --> 01:00:49,655
- Weasley! Weasley! Weasley!
- Weasley! Weasley! Weasley!

771
01:00:55,768 --> 01:00:57,003
You shouldn't
have done it.

772
01:00:57,628 --> 01:01:01,691
I know. I supposed I could have just
used the Confundus charm.

773
01:01:03,472 --> 01:01:04,476
That was different.

774
01:01:05,115 --> 01:01:07,236
That was try-outs,
this was a natural game.

775
01:01:10,533 --> 01:01:11,498
You didn't put in?

776
01:01:13,810 --> 01:01:15,004
Ron only thought
you did.

777
01:02:01,409 --> 01:02:04,066
Charm spell.
Just practising.

778
01:02:08,408 --> 01:02:09,504
Very good.

779
01:02:15,387 --> 01:02:16,947
How does it feel, Harry?

780
01:02:20,066 --> 01:02:22,288
When you see
Dean with Ginny?

781
01:02:28,051 --> 01:02:29,017
I know.

782
01:02:30,507 --> 01:02:32,114
I see the way
you look at her.

783
01:02:33,097 --> 01:02:34,441
You're my best friend.

784
01:02:43,530 --> 01:02:48,247
Oops! I think
this room's taken.

785
01:02:50,469 --> 01:02:51,594
What's with the birds?

786
01:02:55,037 --> 01:02:56,033
Oppugno.

787
01:03:23,699 --> 01:03:24,587
It feels like this.

788
01:04:03,515 --> 01:04:05,536
I can't help it if
she's got her knickers in a twist.

789
01:04:06,227 --> 01:04:09,826
What Lav and I have, well,
let's just say,

790
01:04:10,207 --> 01:04:11,219
there's no stopping it.

791
01:04:11,467 --> 01:04:12,559
It's chemical.

792
01:04:12,971 --> 01:04:15,044
Will it last?
Who knows?

793
01:04:15,267 --> 01:04:17,136
Point is
I'm a free agent.

794
01:04:17,566 --> 01:04:19,908
He's at perfect liberty
to kiss whomever he likes.

795
01:04:20,173 --> 01:04:21,805
I really couldn't
care less.

796
01:04:22,713 --> 01:04:23,682
Was I
under the impression

797
01:04:23,702 --> 01:04:26,133
he and I would be attending
Slughorn's Christmas party together?

798
01:04:26,493 --> 01:04:30,248
Yes. Now,
given the circumstances,

799
01:04:30,288 --> 01:04:31,927
I had to make
other arrangements.

800
01:04:32,518 --> 01:04:34,761
- Have you?
- Yes.

801
01:04:34,796 --> 01:04:35,479
Why?

802
01:04:35,849 --> 01:04:37,819
Well, I just thought
seeing is not the risk at going

803
01:04:37,854 --> 01:04:39,077
with who
we'd really like to,

804
01:04:39,379 --> 01:04:41,229
We should go together,
as friends.

805
01:04:41,860 --> 01:04:43,209
Why didn't
I think of that?

806
01:04:43,518 --> 01:04:44,460
Who are you going with?

807
01:04:45,139 --> 01:04:46,567
Um, it's a surprise.

808
01:04:47,043 --> 01:04:50,234
Anyways, you have got to worry about.
You can't take anyone.

809
01:04:51,483 --> 01:04:53,047
You see that girl
over there?

810
01:04:55,024 --> 01:04:56,453
That's Romilda Vane.

811
01:04:57,436 --> 01:04:59,248
Harry, she's been been trying
to smuggle you a love potion.

812
01:04:59,611 --> 01:05:00,274
Really?

813
01:05:01,971 --> 01:05:02,920
Hey!

814
01:05:02,951 --> 01:05:05,337
She's only interested in you because
she thinks you're the Chosen One.

815
01:05:05,372 --> 01:05:06,600
But I am
the Chosen One.

816
01:05:07,376 --> 01:05:08,826
Okay, sorry, um...

817
01:05:09,529 --> 01:05:10,194
Kidding.

818
01:05:11,101 --> 01:05:13,395
I'll ask someone I like.

819
01:05:14,144 --> 01:05:14,875
Someone cool.

820
01:05:25,044 --> 01:05:27,245
I've never been
to this part of the castle.

821
01:05:28,024 --> 01:05:29,437
At least,
not while awake.

822
01:05:29,653 --> 01:05:30,840
I sleep-walk, you see.

823
01:05:31,205 --> 01:05:32,950
That's why
I wear shoes to bed.

824
01:06:03,762 --> 01:06:05,678
Harmonia nictere passus.

825
01:06:18,665 --> 01:06:20,702
Harmonia nictere passus.

826
01:06:22,648 --> 01:06:24,640
Harmonia nictere passus.

827
01:06:39,339 --> 01:06:39,620
Drink?

828
01:06:41,584 --> 01:06:42,190
Neville.

829
01:06:42,980 --> 01:06:44,312
I didn't get
into the Slug Club.

830
01:06:44,601 --> 01:06:45,718
It's okay, though.

831
01:06:45,978 --> 01:06:47,581
He's got Melvin hanging up
towels in the looroom.

832
01:06:47,599 --> 01:06:48,972
I'm--I'm fine, mate.
Thanks.

833
01:06:49,014 --> 01:06:49,515
Okay.

834
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:01,991
Hermione,
what are you doing?

835
01:07:02,050 --> 01:07:03,285
What happened to you?

836
01:07:03,382 --> 01:07:04,818
No, I've just escaped.

837
01:07:05,249 --> 01:07:08,510
I mean, I left Cormac
under the mistletoe.

838
01:07:08,663 --> 01:07:10,915
Cormac?
That's who you invited?

839
01:07:11,669 --> 01:07:13,724
I thought it would
annoy Ron the most.

840
01:07:14,996 --> 01:07:16,871
Thank you very much.
We will catch up with you.

841
01:07:16,906 --> 01:07:19,261
He's got more tentacles
than a Snargaluff plant.

842
01:07:20,104 --> 01:07:22,199
- Dragon tails?
- No, I'm fine, thank you.

843
01:07:22,281 --> 01:07:24,570
Just this one.
They give one horribly bad breath.

844
01:07:24,962 --> 01:07:28,325
On second thoughts,
it might keep Cormac away.

845
01:07:29,977 --> 01:07:31,015
God, here he comes.

846
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:36,955
I think she just went
to paddle her nose.

847
01:07:37,080 --> 01:07:39,218
She's a little minx,
your friend.

848
01:07:39,401 --> 01:07:41,158
Nice to work.
How nasty isn't she?

849
01:07:41,159 --> 01:07:42,695
Yeah, yeah,
yeah.

850
01:07:44,904 --> 01:07:46,077
What is this I'm eating,
by the way?

851
01:07:48,048 --> 01:07:48,860
Dragon balls.

852
01:08:00,138 --> 01:08:03,670
You've just brought yourself
a month's detention, McLaggen.

853
01:08:03,671 --> 01:08:06,573
Not so quick, Potter.

854
01:08:08,624 --> 01:08:11,771
Sir, I really think I should
rejoin the party. My date--

855
01:08:11,806 --> 01:08:15,860
Can surely survive your absence
for another minute or two.

856
01:08:15,895 --> 01:08:17,932
Besides, I only wish
to convey a message.

857
01:08:18,577 --> 01:08:21,000
- Message?
- From Professor Dumbledore.

858
01:08:21,035 --> 01:08:24,663
He asked me to give you his best
and he hopes you enjoy your holidays.

859
01:08:24,698 --> 01:08:27,060
He...
He's travelling.

860
01:08:27,698 --> 01:08:31,341
And he won't return
until term resumes.

861
01:08:31,529 --> 01:08:32,674
Travelling where?

862
01:08:35,539 --> 01:08:36,753
How are you?

863
01:08:40,969 --> 01:08:42,955
Get your hands off me,
you filthy Squibb.

864
01:08:43,922 --> 01:08:45,380
Professor Slughorn, sir.

865
01:08:45,749 --> 01:08:49,559
I just discovered this boy
lurking in an upstairs corridor.

866
01:08:49,966 --> 01:08:52,120
He claims to have been
invited to your party.

867
01:08:52,155 --> 01:08:53,559
Okay, okay,
I was gate-crashing.

868
01:08:54,294 --> 01:08:54,936
Happy?

869
01:08:55,430 --> 01:08:58,222
I'll escort him out.

870
01:09:01,839 --> 01:09:04,654
Certainly, Professor.

871
01:09:08,721 --> 01:09:11,402
Alright, everyone carry on,
carry on.

872
01:09:13,768 --> 01:09:16,513
Maybe I did hex that Bell girl.
Maybe I didn't.

873
01:09:17,026 --> 01:09:17,957
What about you?

874
01:09:18,739 --> 01:09:23,627
I swore to protect you.
I made the Unbreakable Vow.

875
01:09:24,305 --> 01:09:26,129
I don't need protection.

876
01:09:26,507 --> 01:09:28,087
I was chosen
for this.

877
01:09:28,302 --> 01:09:29,899
I don't know
what all this mean,

878
01:09:31,355 --> 01:09:34,021
- but I won't fail him.
- You're afraid, Draco.

879
01:09:35,230 --> 01:09:37,695
You attempt to consider,
but it's obvious,

880
01:09:37,755 --> 01:09:39,985
- let me assist you.
- No.

881
01:09:40,991 --> 01:09:43,830
I was chosen.
This is my moment.

882
01:09:56,242 --> 01:09:59,374
Unbreakable Vow.
You sure that's what Snape said?

883
01:09:59,715 --> 01:10:02,092
Positive. Why?

884
01:10:02,700 --> 01:10:04,638
It's just, you can't break
an Unbreakable Vow.

885
01:10:05,497 --> 01:10:07,938
I-I worked that much out
for myself, funny enough.

886
01:10:09,160 --> 01:10:10,275
I don't understand.

887
01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:12,708
Oh bloody hell.

888
01:10:39,211 --> 01:10:40,521
I miss you.

889
01:10:42,602 --> 01:10:43,485
Lovely.

890
01:10:44,386 --> 01:10:46,075
All she wants to do
is snog me.

891
01:10:46,478 --> 01:10:47,744
My lips
are getting chapped, look.

892
01:10:47,779 --> 01:10:49,058
Then I'll take
your word for it.

893
01:10:59,398 --> 01:11:00,417
So what happens
to you?

894
01:11:01,497 --> 01:11:03,383
What happens
if you break an Unbreakable Vow?

895
01:11:04,906 --> 01:11:05,784
You die.

896
01:11:13,715 --> 01:11:17,033
Voldemort has chosen
Draco Malfoy for a mission?

897
01:11:17,147 --> 01:11:18,936
- I know it sounds mad.
- Has it occured to you, Harry,

898
01:11:18,986 --> 01:11:21,831
that Snape was simply pretending
to offer Draco help

899
01:11:21,866 --> 01:11:23,218
so he could find out
what he was up to?

900
01:11:23,253 --> 01:11:23,815
Ginny!

901
01:11:24,404 --> 01:11:25,385
That's not
what it sounded like.

902
01:11:25,528 --> 01:11:27,169
Perhaps Harry
is right, Remus.

903
01:11:27,550 --> 01:11:29,298
I mean, to make
an Unbreakable Vow--

904
01:11:29,333 --> 01:11:32,998
It comes down to whether or not
you trust Dumbledore's judgement.

905
01:11:33,033 --> 01:11:35,797
Dumbledore trusts Snape,
therefore, I do.

906
01:11:35,798 --> 01:11:36,826
Dumbledore
can make mistakes.

907
01:11:36,866 --> 01:11:38,255
- He said so himself.
- You are blinded by hatred.

908
01:11:38,290 --> 01:11:39,776
- I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

909
01:11:42,029 --> 01:11:44,829
People are disappearing,
Harry. Daily.

910
01:11:44,962 --> 01:11:47,132
We could only place our trust
in a handful of people.

911
01:11:47,163 --> 01:11:48,718
If we started fighting
amongst ourselves,

912
01:11:48,753 --> 01:11:49,643
we're doomed.

913
01:11:53,390 --> 01:11:54,397
Ginny!

914
01:12:13,446 --> 01:12:14,150
Open up, you.

915
01:12:16,371 --> 01:12:17,457
Don't you trust me?

916
01:12:24,005 --> 01:12:24,766
It's good.

917
01:12:26,110 --> 01:12:27,549
Just, uh, get...

918
01:12:35,163 --> 01:12:37,119
- Pie?
- Not for me. No.

919
01:12:49,151 --> 01:12:50,611
You'll have to forgive
Remus.

920
01:12:50,793 --> 01:12:52,845
It takes its toll,
his condition.

921
01:12:54,486 --> 01:12:55,831
Are you alright,
Mr. Weasley?

922
01:12:56,618 --> 01:12:58,453
We're being followed,
all of us.

923
01:12:59,262 --> 01:13:01,223
Most days, Molly doesn't
leave the house.

924
01:13:02,338 --> 01:13:04,027
It's not been easy.

925
01:13:06,435 --> 01:13:07,348
Did you get my owl?

926
01:13:07,758 --> 01:13:08,994
Yes, I did.

927
01:13:11,282 --> 01:13:13,912
If Dumbledore is traveling,
then perhaps news to the Ministry,

928
01:13:13,947 --> 01:13:16,069
but perhaps that's the way
Dumbledore wants it.

929
01:13:17,407 --> 01:13:19,057
As for Draco Malfoy...

930
01:13:20,346 --> 01:13:21,375
I know a bit more.

931
01:13:22,173 --> 01:13:25,046
- Go on.
- I sent an agent to Borgin and Burkes.

932
01:13:25,222 --> 01:13:26,979
I think from
what you described...

933
01:13:27,325 --> 01:13:29,235
What you and Ron
saw at the end of summer,

934
01:13:29,365 --> 01:13:31,669
the object that Draco
is so interested in,

935
01:13:32,780 --> 01:13:34,253
is a Vanishing Cabinet.

936
01:13:35,066 --> 01:13:36,055
A "Vanishing Cabinet"?

937
01:13:36,467 --> 01:13:39,734
They were all the rage
when Voldemort first rose to power.

938
01:13:40,451 --> 01:13:41,585
You can see the appeal.

939
01:13:41,893 --> 01:13:43,376
Should the Death Eaters
come knocking,

940
01:13:43,487 --> 01:13:47,492
one simply have to slip inside
and disappear for an hour or two.

941
01:13:48,594 --> 01:13:50,294
It transports you
practically anywhere.

942
01:13:50,476 --> 01:13:53,296
Tricky contraptions, though.
Very temperamental.

943
01:13:53,935 --> 01:13:54,851
What happened to it?

944
01:13:55,687 --> 01:13:56,770
The one
at Borgin and Burkes?

945
01:13:56,907 --> 01:13:57,626
Nothing.

946
01:13:58,705 --> 01:13:59,771
It's still there.

947
01:14:11,207 --> 01:14:12,529
It was delicious,
Molly, really.

948
01:14:12,564 --> 01:14:13,749
Are you sure
you won't stay?

949
01:14:14,278 --> 01:14:15,223
No, we should go.

950
01:14:16,142 --> 01:14:18,226
The first night of the cycle's
always the worst.

951
01:14:19,049 --> 01:14:19,676
Remus?

952
01:14:28,233 --> 01:14:29,169
Sweetheart.

953
01:14:37,827 --> 01:14:38,796
Has Ron
gone to bed?

954
01:14:39,611 --> 01:14:41,488
Um, not yet. No.

955
01:14:43,837 --> 01:14:44,998
Shoelace...

956
01:14:57,260 --> 01:14:58,457
Merry Christmas, Harry.

957
01:15:00,485 --> 01:15:01,431
Merry Christmas.

958
01:15:18,517 --> 01:15:20,859
- Harry, no!
- Harry! Remus.

959
01:15:30,299 --> 01:15:30,971
Ginny!

960
01:15:34,769 --> 01:15:39,201
I killed Sirius Black!
I killed Sirius Black!

961
01:15:39,276 --> 01:15:41,035
You coming to get me?

962
01:15:42,945 --> 01:15:44,893
Get me!
He's trying to get me!

963
01:16:14,040 --> 01:16:14,658
Harry?

964
01:16:32,318 --> 01:16:32,899
Stupefy!

965
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:57,295
Harry!

966
01:17:10,580 --> 01:17:11,318
Ginny!

967
01:17:39,995 --> 01:17:40,576
Molly.

968
01:18:03,224 --> 01:18:04,940
It's so easy for them
to get to you.

969
01:18:05,066 --> 01:18:06,647
You're bloody lucky
you weren't killed.

970
01:18:07,868 --> 01:18:09,339
You have to realise
who you are, Harry!

971
01:18:09,374 --> 01:18:10,931
I know who I am,
Hermione, alright.

972
01:18:12,717 --> 01:18:13,285
Sorry.

973
01:18:15,821 --> 01:18:17,898
Hon, go somewhere.

974
01:18:18,676 --> 01:18:20,069
That's my Won-Won.

975
01:18:22,816 --> 01:18:24,344
Excuse me,
I have to go and vomit.

976
01:18:44,708 --> 01:18:46,195
...Always you ruin
half the start.

977
01:18:52,591 --> 01:18:57,332
Sir, is it true that
Professor Merrythought is retiring?

978
01:18:57,765 --> 01:19:00,145
Tom, I couldn't tell you
if I knew, could I?

979
01:19:00,180 --> 01:19:02,126
And by the way,
thank you for the pineapple.

980
01:19:02,176 --> 01:19:03,680
You're quite right.
It is my favorite.

981
01:19:04,973 --> 01:19:06,612
But how did you know?

982
01:19:08,764 --> 01:19:09,844
Intuition.

983
01:19:14,439 --> 01:19:16,276
Good gracious,
is it that time already?

984
01:19:16,311 --> 01:19:18,936
Off you go, boys, or Professor Dippett
will have us all in detention.

985
01:19:23,606 --> 01:19:25,007
Look sharp, Tom.

986
01:19:25,508 --> 01:19:27,541
Don't be caught
out of bed after hours.

987
01:19:29,327 --> 01:19:30,606
Is something
on your mind, Tom?

988
01:19:30,859 --> 01:19:31,727
Yes, sir.

989
01:19:32,552 --> 01:19:34,548
See, I couldnt think of
anyone else to go to.

990
01:19:36,136 --> 01:19:40,232
The other professors...
Well, they're not like you.

991
01:19:41,243 --> 01:19:43,327
They might
misunderstand.

992
01:19:44,208 --> 01:19:45,045
Go on.

993
01:19:46,500 --> 01:19:48,256
I was in the library
the other night.

994
01:19:49,404 --> 01:19:50,999
In the restricted section.

995
01:19:51,395 --> 01:19:55,413
And I picked something
rather odd about this rare magic.

996
01:19:56,405 --> 01:19:58,986
I thought perhaps,
you could illuminate me.

997
01:20:00,062 --> 01:20:04,879
It's called, as I understand it,
Hor...

998
01:20:05,375 --> 01:20:08,315
I beg your pardon?
I don't know anything about such things

999
01:20:08,350 --> 01:20:10,332
and if I did,
I wouldn't tell you.

1000
01:20:10,469 --> 01:20:11,812
Now get out of here
at once

1001
01:20:11,841 --> 01:20:14,065
and dont let me ever catch you
mentioning them again!

1002
01:20:17,714 --> 01:20:20,956
Confused?
I'd be surprised if you weren't.

1003
01:20:21,788 --> 01:20:22,813
I don't understand.

1004
01:20:23,586 --> 01:20:24,378
What happened?

1005
01:20:24,778 --> 01:20:27,515
This is perhaps the most important
memory I had collected.

1006
01:20:28,553 --> 01:20:29,882
It is also a lie.

1007
01:20:31,058 --> 01:20:35,124
This memory has been tempered with
by the same person whose memory it is.

1008
01:20:35,164 --> 01:20:37,106
Our old friend,
Professor Slughorn.

1009
01:20:37,806 --> 01:20:39,921
But why would he temper
with his own memory?

1010
01:20:39,956 --> 01:20:41,362
I suspect
he's ashamed of it.

1011
01:20:41,598 --> 01:20:42,141
Why?

1012
01:20:42,811 --> 01:20:43,929
Why, indeed.

1013
01:20:44,985 --> 01:20:47,193
I asked you to get to know
Professor Slughorn

1014
01:20:47,228 --> 01:20:48,279
and you had done so.

1015
01:20:48,356 --> 01:20:51,719
Now I want you to persuade him
to divulge his true memory.

1016
01:20:51,994 --> 01:20:53,170
Any way you can.

1017
01:20:53,698 --> 01:20:55,299
I don't know him
that well, sir.

1018
01:20:59,763 --> 01:21:04,570
This memory is everything.
Without it, we are blind.

1019
01:21:05,452 --> 01:21:08,294
Without it, we leave
the fate of our world to chance.

1020
01:21:10,837 --> 01:21:12,055
You have no choice.

1021
01:21:13,640 --> 01:21:15,329
You must not fail.

1022
01:21:23,466 --> 01:21:25,520
I highly recommend,
reacquaint yourself

1023
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:27,245
with the chapter
on antidotes.

1024
01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:29,814
Now, I'll tell you more about
bezoars in our next class.

1025
01:21:29,849 --> 01:21:32,831
Right, off you go.
Elise, don't forget your rat tail.

1026
01:21:38,555 --> 01:21:42,177
Aha! It isn't
the Prince of Potions himself!

1027
01:21:42,633 --> 01:21:44,243
What do I owe
this pleasure?

1028
01:21:45,556 --> 01:21:47,651
Oh, sir, I wondered
if I wanted to ask you something.

1029
01:21:47,741 --> 01:21:49,701
Ask away, dear boy.
Ask away.

1030
01:21:50,149 --> 01:21:51,964
Well, you see the other day,
I was in the library

1031
01:21:51,994 --> 01:21:54,185
in the restricted section,
and I came across something

1032
01:21:54,220 --> 01:21:56,685
rather odd
about a very rare piece of magic.

1033
01:21:57,832 --> 01:22:00,596
Yes, what was
this rare piece of magic?

1034
01:22:00,603 --> 01:22:03,718
Well, I don't know,
but I can't remember the name exactly.

1035
01:22:03,719 --> 01:22:06,291
But it just got me wondering,
are there some kinds of magic

1036
01:22:06,332 --> 01:22:07,620
you're not allowed
to teach us?

1037
01:22:10,217 --> 01:22:11,442
I'm Potions Master,
Harry,

1038
01:22:11,477 --> 01:22:14,116
I think your question better be
posed to Professor Snape.

1039
01:22:14,460 --> 01:22:18,638
Yes, he and I don't
exactly see eye-to-eye, sir.

1040
01:22:18,737 --> 01:22:20,848
What I mean
to say is...

1041
01:22:21,086 --> 01:22:22,541
Well, he's not like you.

1042
01:22:23,627 --> 01:22:24,939
He might misunderstand.

1043
01:22:26,852 --> 01:22:30,008
Yes, it would be no light
without the dark.

1044
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:31,535
And so
it is with magic,

1045
01:22:31,584 --> 01:22:33,862
myself I always strive
to live within the light.

1046
01:22:34,907 --> 01:22:36,392
I suggest
you do the same.

1047
01:22:37,208 --> 01:22:39,899
Is that what you told Tom Riddle, sir,
when he came asking questions?

1048
01:22:46,777 --> 01:22:49,118
Dumbledore put you up to this,
didn't he?

1049
01:22:51,330 --> 01:22:52,532
Didn't he?

1050
01:22:59,860 --> 01:23:03,721
Yes?
Oh, it's you, Potter.

1051
01:23:04,111 --> 01:23:06,607
I-I'm sorry,
I'm busy at the moment.

1052
01:23:18,281 --> 01:23:19,910
That's beautiful,
isn't it?

1053
01:23:20,625 --> 01:23:21,425
The moon.

1054
01:23:22,935 --> 01:23:23,842
Divine.

1055
01:23:25,075 --> 01:23:27,110
Had ourselves a little
late night snack, did we?

1056
01:23:28,186 --> 01:23:31,088
It was on your bed, the box.
I just thought I'd try one.

1057
01:23:31,968 --> 01:23:33,007
Or twenty?

1058
01:23:33,621 --> 01:23:35,036
I can't stop
thinking about her, Harry.

1059
01:23:35,232 --> 01:23:37,418
Honestly, you know, I reckon
she was starting to annoy you.

1060
01:23:37,596 --> 01:23:38,955
She could never annoy me.

1061
01:23:41,203 --> 01:23:42,434
I think I love her.

1062
01:23:46,199 --> 01:23:47,881
Well, brilliant.

1063
01:23:52,008 --> 01:23:53,713
Do you think
she knows I exist?

1064
01:23:53,858 --> 01:23:54,825
I very well hope so.

1065
01:23:54,866 --> 01:23:56,505
She's been snogging you
for three months.

1066
01:23:56,778 --> 01:23:59,310
Snogging?
Who are you talking about?

1067
01:24:00,157 --> 01:24:01,427
Who are you talking about?

1068
01:24:02,168 --> 01:24:05,160
Romilda, of course.
Romilda Vane.

1069
01:24:05,637 --> 01:24:06,813
Okay, very funny.

1070
01:24:10,018 --> 01:24:11,457
What was that for?

1071
01:24:11,458 --> 01:24:12,596
It's no joke.

1072
01:24:13,137 --> 01:24:14,612
- I'm in love with her!
- Alright, fine.

1073
01:24:14,652 --> 01:24:16,333
You're in love with her.
Have you ever actually met her?

1074
01:24:17,524 --> 01:24:20,278
No.
Can you introduce me?

1075
01:24:41,351 --> 01:24:45,009
Come on, Ron.
I will introduce you to Romilda Vane.

1076
01:24:56,244 --> 01:24:56,821
I'm sorry, sir.

1077
01:24:56,851 --> 01:24:58,989
I wouldn't bother you
if it weren't absolutely essential.

1078
01:25:00,541 --> 01:25:03,243
- Where's Romilda?
- What's the matter with Wimby?

1079
01:25:04,230 --> 01:25:05,926
Very powerful love potion.

1080
01:25:06,157 --> 01:25:07,993
Very well,
better bring him in.

1081
01:25:08,732 --> 01:25:11,831
I always thought you could whip up
a remedy for this is in no time, Harry.

1082
01:25:11,926 --> 01:25:14,187
Well, I-I thought this called
for more practised hands, sir.

1083
01:25:15,043 --> 01:25:17,935
Hello, darling.
Fancy a drink?

1084
01:25:18,096 --> 01:25:19,088
Perhaps, you're right.

1085
01:25:23,931 --> 01:25:26,834
I'm sorry, by the way, Professor,
about earlier today.

1086
01:25:27,492 --> 01:25:28,831
Our misunderstanding.

1087
01:25:29,248 --> 01:25:31,998
Oh, not at all.
Old water under the bridge, you know.

1088
01:25:32,292 --> 01:25:32,848
Correct?

1089
01:25:33,510 --> 01:25:35,944
Well, I expect you're tired a bit,
after all these years.

1090
01:25:36,771 --> 01:25:38,939
And the questions
about Voldemort.

1091
01:25:39,324 --> 01:25:40,432
Don't use that name!

1092
01:25:48,535 --> 01:25:50,070
Here you go, boy.
Bottom's up.

1093
01:25:50,654 --> 01:25:53,107
- What's this?
- Tonic for the nerves.

1094
01:26:07,635 --> 01:26:08,532
What happened to me?

1095
01:26:08,651 --> 01:26:11,597
- A love potion.
- A bloody strong one at there.

1096
01:26:12,518 --> 01:26:15,461
- I feel really bad.
- You need to pick me up, my boy.

1097
01:26:15,716 --> 01:26:19,942
Got butterbeer, wine,
dazzling oak-matured mead.

1098
01:26:19,977 --> 01:26:22,947
I had other intentions for this,
but I think, given the circumstances.

1099
01:26:26,073 --> 01:26:27,155
Here you are, Potter.

1100
01:26:28,112 --> 01:26:28,779
To life!

1101
01:26:33,950 --> 01:26:34,604
Ron!

1102
01:26:37,368 --> 01:26:40,415
Ron!
Professor, do something.

1103
01:26:41,850 --> 01:26:43,457
I-I don't understand!

1104
01:26:59,035 --> 01:27:00,383
Come on, Ron,
breathe!

1105
01:27:22,101 --> 01:27:24,376
These girls...
They're gonna kill me.

1106
01:27:35,509 --> 01:27:37,848
Quick thinking on your part,
Harry, using a bezoar.

1107
01:27:38,735 --> 01:27:40,590
You should be very proud
of your student, Horace.

1108
01:27:42,520 --> 01:27:44,233
Ah, yes.
Very proud.

1109
01:27:44,692 --> 01:27:47,524
I think we agree
Potter's actions were heroic.

1110
01:27:47,564 --> 01:27:51,156
The question is:
Why were they necessary?

1111
01:27:51,540 --> 01:27:52,435
I, indeed.

1112
01:27:53,445 --> 01:27:55,224
This appears to be a gift,
Horace.

1113
01:27:55,569 --> 01:27:57,399
You don't remember
who gave you this bottle?

1114
01:27:58,579 --> 01:28:00,079
By the way,
it possesses remarkably

1115
01:28:00,114 --> 01:28:01,986
subtle hints
of liquorice and cherry.

1116
01:28:02,287 --> 01:28:04,037
When not polluted
with poison.

1117
01:28:04,822 --> 01:28:07,573
Actually, I had intended
to give it as a gift, myself.

1118
01:28:08,144 --> 01:28:09,328
To whom,
might I ask?

1119
01:28:11,049 --> 01:28:12,668
To you, headmaster.

1120
01:28:15,541 --> 01:28:17,588
Where is he?
Where's my Won-Won?

1121
01:28:18,510 --> 01:28:19,863
Has he been
asking for me?

1122
01:28:23,529 --> 01:28:24,824
What's she doing here?

1123
01:28:25,176 --> 01:28:26,951
I might ask you
the same question.

1124
01:28:27,704 --> 01:28:29,746
I happen to be
his girlfriend.

1125
01:28:29,781 --> 01:28:32,204
And I happen to be his...
friend.

1126
01:28:32,667 --> 01:28:33,946
Don't make me laugh.

1127
01:28:34,445 --> 01:28:36,188
You haven't spoken
in weeks.

1128
01:28:37,549 --> 01:28:38,708
I suppose you want
to make up with him

1129
01:28:38,758 --> 01:28:40,692
now that he's suddenly
all interesting.

1130
01:28:40,743 --> 01:28:43,206
He's been poisoned,
you daft dimbo!

1131
01:28:44,087 --> 01:28:46,270
And for the record,
I've always found him interesting.

1132
01:28:49,116 --> 01:28:52,499
See?
He senses my presence.

1133
01:28:53,493 --> 01:28:56,491
Don't worry, Won-Won.
I'm here.

1134
01:28:57,357 --> 01:28:58,286
I'm here.

1135
01:29:05,041 --> 01:29:06,912
Hermione.

1136
01:29:11,075 --> 01:29:12,801
Hermione.

1137
01:29:14,601 --> 01:29:15,825
Hermione.

1138
01:29:23,673 --> 01:29:26,671
Oh to be young
and to feel love's keen sting.

1139
01:29:27,581 --> 01:29:29,591
Well, come over,
everybody.

1140
01:29:30,132 --> 01:29:31,996
Mr. Weasley's well attended.

1141
01:29:36,845 --> 01:29:38,406
About time,
don't you think?

1142
01:29:41,752 --> 01:29:42,716
Thank you.

1143
01:29:46,136 --> 01:29:47,016
Just shut up.

1144
01:31:54,759 --> 01:31:55,588
Stop it, Ron.

1145
01:31:56,285 --> 01:31:57,624
You're making it snow.

1146
01:32:02,559 --> 01:32:04,769
Tell me how I broke up
with Lavender again.

1147
01:32:06,168 --> 01:32:10,935
Well, she came to visit you
in the hospital.

1148
01:32:12,411 --> 01:32:14,168
And you talked.

1149
01:32:16,220 --> 01:32:19,370
I don't believe it was
a particularly long conversation.

1150
01:32:20,360 --> 01:32:23,280
Don't get me wrong.
I'm bloody thrilled to be shot of her's.

1151
01:32:23,691 --> 01:32:25,328
She seems a bit...
put out.

1152
01:32:32,349 --> 01:32:34,898
Yes, um...
She does, isn't she?

1153
01:32:37,206 --> 01:32:41,420
You say you don't remember
anything from that night.

1154
01:32:42,031 --> 01:32:44,305
Anything at all?

1155
01:32:45,190 --> 01:32:46,369
There is something.

1156
01:32:50,616 --> 01:32:51,631
It can't be.

1157
01:32:52,583 --> 01:32:54,057
I was completely boggled,
didn't I?

1158
01:32:57,612 --> 01:32:58,575
Boggled.

1159
01:33:06,094 --> 01:33:06,784
Harry...

1160
01:33:08,596 --> 01:33:12,655
That's Katie.
Katie Bell.

1161
01:33:20,470 --> 01:33:22,769
Katie,
how are you?

1162
01:33:23,557 --> 01:33:25,282
I know you're going
to ask, Harry.

1163
01:33:26,067 --> 01:33:27,917
But I don't know
who cursed me.

1164
01:33:29,444 --> 01:33:32,062
I've been trying
to remember. Honestly.

1165
01:33:33,335 --> 01:33:36,025
But I just can't.

1166
01:33:49,403 --> 01:33:50,016
Katie.

1167
01:34:31,248 --> 01:34:32,550
I know what you did,
Malfoy.

1168
01:34:33,180 --> 01:34:34,438
You hexed it,
didn't you?

1169
01:35:04,280 --> 01:35:05,357
Sectumsempra!

1170
01:36:23,602 --> 01:36:24,777
You have
to get rid of it.

1171
01:36:25,425 --> 01:36:26,167
Today.

1172
01:36:31,452 --> 01:36:32,656
Take my hand.

1173
01:36:48,526 --> 01:36:49,950
It's the Room of Requirement.

1174
01:36:56,235 --> 01:36:58,636
We need to hide
the Half-Blood Prince's book.

1175
01:36:59,239 --> 01:37:02,078
Where no one'll ever find it.
Including you.

1176
01:37:10,713 --> 01:37:11,527
- What was that?
- What was that?

1177
01:37:37,106 --> 01:37:40,372
See, you never know
what you'll find up here.

1178
01:37:59,184 --> 01:38:02,879
Alright, close your eyes.
That way you can't be tempted.

1179
01:38:06,666 --> 01:38:07,736
Close your eyes.

1180
01:38:13,517 --> 01:38:13,665
S    u    B:
V  e R  d  i K  T

1181
01:38:33,959 --> 01:38:35,782
That can stay hidden
up here too if you like.

1182
01:38:50,756 --> 01:38:52,273
So, did you and Ginny
do it then?

1183
01:38:53,099 --> 01:38:53,806
What?

1184
01:38:54,553 --> 01:38:55,806
Well, hide the book?

1185
01:38:56,488 --> 01:38:57,922
Oh, yeah.

1186
01:39:01,240 --> 01:39:02,521
Oh, g--

1187
01:39:03,933 --> 01:39:05,872
Still no luck with Slughorn then,
I take it?

1188
01:39:08,348 --> 01:39:09,103
Luck.

1189
01:39:10,616 --> 01:39:13,268
That's it.
All I need is a bit of luck.

1190
01:39:31,391 --> 01:39:33,692
Well, how do you feel?

1191
01:39:34,588 --> 01:39:35,354
Excellent.

1192
01:39:37,252 --> 01:39:38,528
Really excellent.

1193
01:39:41,831 --> 01:39:46,555
Remember, Slughorn usually
leaves early, takes a walk,

1194
01:39:46,922 --> 01:39:48,639
and then
returns to his office.

1195
01:39:48,674 --> 01:39:51,385
Right.
I'm going down to Hagrid's.

1196
01:39:51,386 --> 01:39:52,007
What?

1197
01:39:52,467 --> 01:39:55,076
No, Harry, you've got
to go to speak to Slughorn.

1198
01:39:56,641 --> 01:39:57,627
We have a plan.

1199
01:39:57,662 --> 01:40:01,425
I know but I've got a really
good feeling about Hagrid's.

1200
01:40:01,460 --> 01:40:03,819
I feel it's--it's
the place to be tonight.

1201
01:40:04,186 --> 01:40:04,812
Do you know
what I mean?

1202
01:40:05,826 --> 01:40:06,532
- No.
- No.

1203
01:40:06,658 --> 01:40:08,077
Well, trust me.
I know what I'm doing.

1204
01:40:08,112 --> 01:40:09,651
Or Felix does.

1205
01:40:11,336 --> 01:40:11,878
Hi!

1206
01:40:41,974 --> 01:40:44,800
- Merlin's beard, Harry!
- Sorry, sir.

1207
01:40:45,092 --> 01:40:46,291
I should have announced myself.

1208
01:40:46,326 --> 01:40:47,845
Clear my throat.
Coughed.

1209
01:40:48,134 --> 01:40:50,124
You probably thought
I was Professor Sprout?

1210
01:40:50,601 --> 01:40:52,889
Definitely.
What makes you think?

1211
01:40:53,337 --> 01:40:55,653
Ah well,
just your general behaviour, sir.

1212
01:40:55,685 --> 01:40:58,359
Just sneaking around,
jumping when you saw me.

1213
01:40:58,533 --> 01:41:00,486
- Are those tentacular leaves, sir?
- Yes.

1214
01:41:00,676 --> 01:41:01,685
They're very valuable,
aren't they?

1215
01:41:02,311 --> 01:41:04,458
Ten galleons a leaf
to the right buyer.

1216
01:41:04,659 --> 01:41:06,830
Not that I'm familiar with
any such back alley transactions

1217
01:41:06,849 --> 01:41:08,012
but one does hear rumours.

1218
01:41:08,047 --> 01:41:10,755
My only interests
are purely academical.

1219
01:41:11,915 --> 01:41:14,370
I mean, personally,
these plants always kinda freak me out.

1220
01:41:17,977 --> 01:41:20,229
Exactly how did you get
out of the castle, Harry?

1221
01:41:20,339 --> 01:41:23,153
Through the front door, sir.
I'm off to Hagrid's, you see.

1222
01:41:23,195 --> 01:41:25,961
He's a very dear friend
and I just fancy paying him a visit.

1223
01:41:26,105 --> 01:41:28,224
So if you don't mind,
I will be going now.

1224
01:41:28,954 --> 01:41:31,947
- Harry!
- Sir?

1225
01:41:31,982 --> 01:41:33,426
It's nearly nightfall.

1226
01:41:33,865 --> 01:41:35,654
Surely, you realise
I can't allow you to go

1227
01:41:35,689 --> 01:41:37,384
roaming the grounds
by yourself.

1228
01:41:37,386 --> 01:41:39,256
Well then, by all means,
come along, sir.

1229
01:41:45,116 --> 01:41:48,215
Harry, I must insist you
accompany me

1230
01:41:48,250 --> 01:41:50,107
back to the castle
immediately!

1231
01:41:50,262 --> 01:41:52,545
That would
be counterproductive, sir.

1232
01:41:54,384 --> 01:41:55,821
And what makes
you say that?

1233
01:41:57,502 --> 01:41:58,271
No idea.

1234
01:42:05,306 --> 01:42:06,173
Horace.

1235
01:42:07,390 --> 01:42:11,987
Merlin's beard!
Is that an actual Acromantula?

1236
01:42:13,166 --> 01:42:14,491
A dead one,
I think, sir.

1237
01:42:16,001 --> 01:42:16,946
Good God.

1238
01:42:17,921 --> 01:42:20,223
Dear fellow, however
did you manage to kill it?

1239
01:42:21,240 --> 01:42:22,041
"Kill it"?

1240
01:42:22,330 --> 01:42:23,697
My oldest friend,
he was.

1241
01:42:24,631 --> 01:42:25,873
I'm so sorry,
I didn't--

1242
01:42:25,913 --> 01:42:28,067
Ah, don't worry yourself.
You're not alone.

1243
01:42:29,567 --> 01:42:32,108
Seriously misunderstood creatures,
spiders are.

1244
01:42:32,709 --> 01:42:34,921
The eyes I reckon,
they unnerve some folk.

1245
01:42:35,214 --> 01:42:36,533
Not to mention
the pincers.

1246
01:42:41,244 --> 01:42:42,461
Yeah,
I reckon that too.

1247
01:42:43,612 --> 01:42:44,198
Hagrid...

1248
01:42:45,107 --> 01:42:47,137
The last thing
I wish to be is indelicate

1249
01:42:47,172 --> 01:42:50,415
but Acromantula venom
is uncommonly rare.

1250
01:42:51,182 --> 01:42:53,394
Would you allow me
to extract a vial or two,

1251
01:42:53,423 --> 01:42:55,925
purely for academic purposes,
you understand?

1252
01:42:56,255 --> 01:42:59,069
Well I don't suppose it's gonna do him
much good now is it.

1253
01:42:59,205 --> 01:43:00,276
My thoughts exactly.

1254
01:43:00,491 --> 01:43:06,430
I have a ampoule or two about my person
for just such occassions as this.

1255
01:43:06,835 --> 01:43:11,079
Old... Potion master's habit,
you know?

1256
01:43:12,139 --> 01:43:13,848
I wish you could have
seen him with his prime.

1257
01:43:14,968 --> 01:43:16,241
Magnificent, he was.

1258
01:43:17,071 --> 01:43:18,359
Just magnificent.

1259
01:43:30,469 --> 01:43:32,384
Would you like me
to say a few words?

1260
01:43:32,419 --> 01:43:32,980
Yes.

1261
01:43:33,917 --> 01:43:35,152
Had a family, I trust?

1262
01:43:35,463 --> 01:43:36,482
Oh, yeah.

1263
01:43:42,109 --> 01:43:45,130
- Farewell...
- Aragog.

1264
01:43:49,829 --> 01:43:52,701
Farewell, Aragog.

1265
01:43:53,061 --> 01:43:55,894
King of the arachnids.

1266
01:43:56,351 --> 01:43:58,492
Your body will decay...

1267
01:43:59,979 --> 01:44:02,666
but your spirit lingers on

1268
01:44:03,308 --> 01:44:06,307
and your human friends
find solace,

1269
01:44:06,342 --> 01:44:09,103
the loss
they have sustained.

1270
01:44:10,338 --> 01:44:12,894
# Laid to rest, #

1271
01:44:13,286 --> 01:44:17,274
# And his wand,
snapped in two, #

1272
01:44:17,486 --> 01:44:21,017
# Which was sad, #

1273
01:44:24,377 --> 01:44:25,727
I had him from an egg,
you know?

1274
01:44:25,872 --> 01:44:27,846
Tiny little thing he was
when he hatched.

1275
01:44:28,020 --> 01:44:30,088
No bigger
than a Pekingese.

1276
01:44:30,123 --> 01:44:31,694
A Pekingese, mind you.

1277
01:44:31,795 --> 01:44:34,583
How sweet!
I once had a fish.

1278
01:44:34,725 --> 01:44:36,581
Francis.
He was very dear to me.

1279
01:44:36,831 --> 01:44:39,762
One afternoon,
I came downstairs and...

1280
01:44:40,394 --> 01:44:41,182
it vanished.

1281
01:44:41,765 --> 01:44:42,341
Poof.

1282
01:44:43,258 --> 01:44:44,556
That's very odd,
isn't it?

1283
01:44:44,734 --> 01:44:48,222
Yes, doesn't it?
But that's life!

1284
01:44:48,343 --> 01:44:51,464
I suppose,
you--you go along with

1285
01:44:51,499 --> 01:44:54,755
and suddenly...
poof.

1286
01:44:55,775 --> 01:44:56,301
Poof.

1287
01:44:57,740 --> 01:44:58,551
Poof.

1288
01:45:12,967 --> 01:45:15,598
It was a student
who gave me Francis.

1289
01:45:16,953 --> 01:45:20,371
One spring afternoon,
I discovered the bowl on my desk...

1290
01:45:21,690 --> 01:45:25,416
With just a few inches
of clear water in it...

1291
01:45:25,451 --> 01:45:28,560
And floating on the surface
was a flower petal.

1292
01:45:30,531 --> 01:45:32,449
As I watched, it sank.

1293
01:45:34,025 --> 01:45:36,244
But just before
it reached the bottom,

1294
01:45:37,008 --> 01:45:41,516
it transformed
into a wee fish.

1295
01:45:43,105 --> 01:45:45,293
It was beautiful magic.

1296
01:45:46,247 --> 01:45:48,157
Wondrous to behold.

1297
01:45:50,877 --> 01:45:53,018
The flower petal
had come from a lily.

1298
01:45:55,608 --> 01:45:56,939
Your mother.

1299
01:45:58,782 --> 01:46:03,881
The day I came downstairs,
day's the bowl was empty.

1300
01:46:05,873 --> 01:46:07,274
That's the day
your mother...

1301
01:46:11,888 --> 01:46:13,170
I know
why you're here.

1302
01:46:16,483 --> 01:46:18,108
But I can't help you.

1303
01:46:20,137 --> 01:46:21,284
It would ruin me.

1304
01:46:25,512 --> 01:46:27,224
Do you know
why I survived, Professor?

1305
01:46:28,333 --> 01:46:29,508
The night I got this?

1306
01:46:31,603 --> 01:46:36,134
Because of her,
because she sacrificed herself...

1307
01:46:36,264 --> 01:46:38,540
Because she refused
to step aside.

1308
01:46:38,745 --> 01:46:41,930
Because her love was more powerful
than Voldemort.

1309
01:46:42,030 --> 01:46:44,818
- Don't say his name.
- I'm not afraid of the name, Professor.

1310
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:47,817
I'm going
to tell you something.

1311
01:46:49,244 --> 01:46:51,364
Something others
have only guessed at.

1312
01:46:54,004 --> 01:46:57,327
It's true.
I am the Chosen One.

1313
01:46:58,280 --> 01:47:00,543
Only I can destroy him,
but in order to do so,

1314
01:47:00,583 --> 01:47:02,551
I need to know
what Tom Riddle asked you

1315
01:47:02,602 --> 01:47:03,852
all those years ago
in your office

1316
01:47:03,882 --> 01:47:05,445
and I need to know
what you told him.

1317
01:47:06,794 --> 01:47:08,463
Be brave, Professor.

1318
01:47:10,577 --> 01:47:11,985
Be brave
like my mother.

1319
01:47:13,804 --> 01:47:16,108
Otherwise,
you disgrace her.

1320
01:47:17,379 --> 01:47:19,264
Otherwise,
she died for nothing.

1321
01:47:20,502 --> 01:47:23,673
Otherwise,
the bowl will remain empty.

1322
01:47:24,087 --> 01:47:24,864
Forever.

1323
01:47:35,486 --> 01:47:38,591
Please, don't think badly of me
when you say it.

1324
01:47:40,152 --> 01:47:42,756
I had no idea
what he was like, even then.

1325
01:48:19,011 --> 01:48:20,629
I was in the library
the other day.

1326
01:48:21,715 --> 01:48:23,312
In the restricted section...

1327
01:48:23,937 --> 01:48:27,845
and I read something
rather odd about this rare magic.

1328
01:48:29,018 --> 01:48:34,420
It's called, as I understand it,
a Horcrux.

1329
01:48:36,344 --> 01:48:38,400
- I beg your pardon?
- Horcrux.

1330
01:48:39,385 --> 01:48:40,954
I came across the term
while reading...

1331
01:48:42,036 --> 01:48:44,250
and I didn't fully
understand it.

1332
01:48:44,667 --> 01:48:46,228
I'm not sure
what you were reading, Tom,

1333
01:48:46,268 --> 01:48:49,161
but this is very dark stuff.
Very dark, indeed.

1334
01:48:49,675 --> 01:48:53,362
Which is...
why I came to you.

1335
01:48:56,713 --> 01:48:59,848
A horcrux is an object
in which a person has concealed

1336
01:49:00,028 --> 01:49:01,185
part of their soul.

1337
01:49:01,980 --> 01:49:03,966
But I don't understand
how that works, sir.

1338
01:49:07,330 --> 01:49:10,038
One splits one's soul
and hides part of it in an object.

1339
01:49:11,137 --> 01:49:12,369
By doing so,
you are protected,

1340
01:49:12,399 --> 01:49:14,480
should you be attacked
and your body destroyed.

1341
01:49:14,515 --> 01:49:15,582
Protected?

1342
01:49:15,932 --> 01:49:18,526
That part of your soul
which is hidden lives on.

1343
01:49:20,529 --> 01:49:22,269
In other words,
you cannot die.

1344
01:49:29,793 --> 01:49:31,946
And how does
one splits his soul, sir?

1345
01:49:32,809 --> 01:49:34,972
I think you already know
the answer to that, Tom.

1346
01:49:36,707 --> 01:49:37,680
Murder.

1347
01:49:38,667 --> 01:49:44,585
Yes, killing rips the soul apart
and it is a violation against nature.

1348
01:49:46,245 --> 01:49:48,495
Can you only
split the soul once?

1349
01:49:48,530 --> 01:49:50,666
For instance,
isn't seven--

1350
01:49:50,686 --> 01:49:54,333
Seven?
Merlin's beard, Tom!

1351
01:49:54,766 --> 01:49:57,386
Isn't it bad enough
to consider killing one person?

1352
01:49:58,076 --> 01:50:00,936
To rip the soul
in seven pieces!

1353
01:50:02,856 --> 01:50:04,792
This is all hypothetical,
isn't it, Tom?

1354
01:50:04,827 --> 01:50:05,834
All academic?

1355
01:50:10,294 --> 01:50:11,604
Of course, sir.

1356
01:50:14,531 --> 01:50:15,900
It'll be our little secret.

1357
01:50:24,759 --> 01:50:25,661
Sir.

1358
01:50:40,992 --> 01:50:42,773
This is beyond anything
I imagined.

1359
01:50:42,953 --> 01:50:44,385
Do you mean, sir,
he succeeded, sir?

1360
01:50:44,929 --> 01:50:47,443
- In making a Horcrux?
- Oh yes, he succeeded, alright.

1361
01:50:47,993 --> 01:50:50,117
- And not just once.
- What are they exactly?

1362
01:50:50,152 --> 01:50:50,979
It could be anything.

1363
01:50:51,229 --> 01:50:52,964
Most common place
of objects.

1364
01:50:56,110 --> 01:50:59,578
A ring, for example,
or a book.

1365
01:51:01,269 --> 01:51:02,483
Tom Riddle's diary.

1366
01:51:02,484 --> 01:51:03,732
It's a horcrux, yes.

1367
01:51:04,209 --> 01:51:06,389
Four years ago when you saved
Ginny Weasley's life

1368
01:51:06,409 --> 01:51:08,477
in the Chamber of Secrets,
you brought me this.

1369
01:51:08,614 --> 01:51:10,672
I knew then,
this was a different kind of magic.

1370
01:51:10,707 --> 01:51:12,881
Very dark,
very powerful.

1371
01:51:13,247 --> 01:51:15,698
But until tonight,
I had no idea just how powerful...

1372
01:51:15,739 --> 01:51:17,874
- And the ring?
- Belonged to Voldemort's mother.

1373
01:51:18,041 --> 01:51:22,362
Difficult to find.
Even more difficult to destroy.

1374
01:51:22,695 --> 01:51:26,209
But if you could find them all,
if you did destroy each Horcrux--

1375
01:51:26,229 --> 01:51:27,450
One destroys Voldemort.

1376
01:51:27,814 --> 01:51:28,694
How would you
find them?

1377
01:51:29,553 --> 01:51:30,847
They could be hidden anywhere,
couldn't they?

1378
01:51:30,882 --> 01:51:33,837
True, but magic,
especially dark magic...

1379
01:51:47,237 --> 01:51:48,526
leaves traces.

1380
01:51:56,316 --> 01:51:57,931
It's where you've been going,
isn't it, sir?

1381
01:51:58,323 --> 01:51:59,626
When you leave the school.

1382
01:51:59,961 --> 01:52:03,889
Yes, and I think perhaps,
I may have found another.

1383
01:52:04,710 --> 01:52:08,272
But this time,
I cannot hope to destroy it alone.

1384
01:52:10,127 --> 01:52:14,098
Once again, I must ask
too much of you, Harry.

1385
01:52:18,466 --> 01:52:20,912
Have you ever considered
that you ask too much,

1386
01:52:20,952 --> 01:52:23,546
that you take too much
for granted?

1387
01:52:23,575 --> 01:52:25,787
Has it ever crossed
your brilliant mind

1388
01:52:25,817 --> 01:52:28,496
that I don't want
to do this anymore?

1389
01:52:28,512 --> 01:52:30,684
Whether it has or hasn't
is irrelevant.

1390
01:52:31,202 --> 01:52:33,363
I will not negotiate
with you, Severus.

1391
01:52:33,398 --> 01:52:36,271
You agreed.
Nothing more to discuss.

1392
01:52:54,612 --> 01:52:55,505
Oh, Harry...

1393
01:52:58,564 --> 01:53:00,293
You need a shave,
my friend.

1394
01:53:03,409 --> 01:53:07,179
You know, at times,
I forget how much you've grown.

1395
01:53:07,693 --> 01:53:10,678
At times, I still see
the small boy from the cupboard.

1396
01:53:12,914 --> 01:53:16,665
Forgive my mawkishness, Harry.
I'm an old man.

1397
01:53:17,263 --> 01:53:18,546
You still look
the same to me, sir.

1398
01:53:20,220 --> 01:53:22,913
Just like your mother,
you are unfailingly kind.

1399
01:53:23,267 --> 01:53:25,810
A trait people never fail
to undervalue, I'm afraid.

1400
01:53:29,028 --> 01:53:32,639
The place to which we journey tonight
is extremely dangerous.

1401
01:53:33,458 --> 01:53:36,626
I promise you for the company of me
and I stand by that promise.

1402
01:53:36,991 --> 01:53:38,391
But there's one condition.

1403
01:53:38,898 --> 01:53:41,937
You must obey every command
I give you without question.

1404
01:53:42,873 --> 01:53:43,487
Yes, sir.

1405
01:53:44,377 --> 01:53:45,925
You do understand
what I'm saying.

1406
01:53:47,162 --> 01:53:49,110
Should I tell you to hide,
you hide.

1407
01:53:49,663 --> 01:53:51,567
Should I tell you to run,
you run.

1408
01:53:52,324 --> 01:53:54,995
Should I tell you to abandon me
and save yourself,

1409
01:53:55,036 --> 01:53:56,103
you must do so.

1410
01:54:00,852 --> 01:54:02,041
Your word, Harry.

1411
01:54:03,828 --> 01:54:04,786
My word.

1412
01:54:06,293 --> 01:54:06,932
Take my arm.

1413
01:54:09,026 --> 01:54:11,558
Sir, I thought you couldn't
Apparate within Hogwarts.

1414
01:54:12,243 --> 01:54:15,175
Well, being me
has its privileges.

1415
01:55:00,545 --> 01:55:01,940
This is the place.

1416
01:55:03,025 --> 01:55:07,247
Oh, yes.
This place has known magic.

1417
01:55:15,970 --> 01:55:16,473
Sir.

1418
01:55:16,503 --> 01:55:18,910
In order to gain passage,
payment must be made.

1419
01:55:18,911 --> 01:55:21,614
Payment intended
to weaken any intruder.

1420
01:55:23,817 --> 01:55:24,740
You should have
let me, sir.

1421
01:55:24,775 --> 01:55:28,039
No, no, Harry. Your blood's
much more precious than mine.

1422
01:55:49,587 --> 01:55:53,473
Voldemort would not have made it easy
to discover his hiding place.

1423
01:55:54,329 --> 01:55:56,853
He would put
certain defenses in position.

1424
01:55:59,875 --> 01:56:00,570
Careful.

1425
01:56:23,762 --> 01:56:24,669
There it is.

1426
01:56:26,286 --> 01:56:28,336
The only question is
how do we get there?

1427
01:56:50,411 --> 01:56:51,409
If you would, Harry.

1428
01:57:37,361 --> 01:57:38,818
Do you think
the Horcrux is in there, sir?

1429
01:57:40,234 --> 01:57:41,195
Oh, yes.

1430
01:57:52,093 --> 01:57:53,551
It has to be drunk.

1431
01:57:54,084 --> 01:57:56,325
All of it
has to be drunk.

1432
01:57:57,355 --> 01:58:00,033
You remember the conditions
on which I brought you with me?

1433
01:58:00,800 --> 01:58:02,808
This potion
might paralyze me.

1434
01:58:03,389 --> 01:58:05,096
I may risk
to get what I'm here.

1435
01:58:05,830 --> 01:58:08,302
I'd cause me so much pain
that I'd beg for relief.

1436
01:58:09,031 --> 01:58:11,083
You are not to indulge
these requests.

1437
01:58:11,278 --> 01:58:14,150
It's your job, Harry, to make sure
I keep drinking this potion.

1438
01:58:14,720 --> 01:58:16,984
Even if you have
to force it down my throat.

1439
01:58:17,623 --> 01:58:18,327
Understood?

1440
01:58:18,588 --> 01:58:19,870
Why can't I drink it, sir?

1441
01:58:19,904 --> 01:58:24,374
Because I'm much older,
much cleverer and much less valuable.

1442
01:58:28,795 --> 01:58:30,136
Your good health, Harry.

1443
01:58:46,089 --> 01:58:47,305
Professor.

1444
01:58:49,366 --> 01:58:50,185
Professor!

1445
01:58:58,591 --> 01:58:59,307
Professor.

1446
01:58:59,951 --> 01:59:01,102
Can you hear me?

1447
01:59:02,274 --> 01:59:03,007
Professor!

1448
01:59:19,427 --> 01:59:21,780
You have to keep drinking
like you said, remember?

1449
01:59:30,254 --> 01:59:32,437
- Stop.
- I will stop. I will stop.

1450
01:59:32,475 --> 01:59:34,766
But only--
only if you keep drinking.

1451
01:59:35,079 --> 01:59:37,726
- Don't make me-- Kill me.
- I'm sorry, sir.

1452
01:59:39,695 --> 01:59:40,787
Kill me!

1453
01:59:46,121 --> 01:59:47,055
All my fault.

1454
01:59:48,788 --> 01:59:49,987
My fault.

1455
01:59:50,259 --> 01:59:53,827
Just one more, sir.
One more, I promise.

1456
01:59:54,143 --> 01:59:56,436
- I promise I'll do what you say.
- No, no.

1457
01:59:56,737 --> 01:59:57,473
I promise!

1458
01:59:59,491 --> 02:00:00,335
Please!

1459
02:00:23,953 --> 02:00:24,546
Harry.

1460
02:00:32,188 --> 02:00:32,999
Water.

1461
02:00:33,951 --> 02:00:35,982
- Water.
- Water.

1462
02:00:43,052 --> 02:00:44,201
Look, you did it, sir.

1463
02:00:45,129 --> 02:00:45,850
Look.

1464
02:00:48,312 --> 02:00:51,729
Harry...
water.

1465
02:00:53,801 --> 02:00:55,062
Aguamenti!

1466
02:00:55,919 --> 02:00:56,552
Water.

1467
02:01:31,691 --> 02:01:32,542
Lumos.

1468
02:02:00,413 --> 02:02:01,702
Lumos maxima!

1469
02:02:13,608 --> 02:02:15,845
Stupefy! Stupefy!

1470
02:02:17,033 --> 02:02:18,174
Sectumsempra!

1471
02:02:18,175 --> 02:02:19,657
- Harry...
- Incarcerous!

1472
02:02:20,276 --> 02:02:21,461
- Stupefy!
- Harry...

1473
02:03:18,852 --> 02:03:19,815
Harry...

1474
02:03:23,556 --> 02:03:25,188
Partis Temporus!

1475
02:04:06,649 --> 02:04:09,072
Go to your houses!
No toddling!

1476
02:04:49,029 --> 02:04:50,723
We need to get you
to the hospital wing, sir.

1477
02:04:51,198 --> 02:04:52,453
To Madam Pomfrey.

1478
02:04:54,761 --> 02:04:59,578
No...
Severus, Severus is awakening.

1479
02:04:59,813 --> 02:05:02,058
Wake him.
Tell him what happened.

1480
02:05:03,246 --> 02:05:04,526
Speak
to no one else.

1481
02:05:05,606 --> 02:05:07,165
Severus, Harry.

1482
02:05:12,836 --> 02:05:14,276
Hide yourself below,
Harry.

1483
02:05:16,202 --> 02:05:19,127
Don't speak or be seen by anybody
without my permission.

1484
02:05:19,585 --> 02:05:22,798
Whatever happens,
it's imperative you stay below.

1485
02:05:23,949 --> 02:05:25,058
Harry, do as I say.

1486
02:05:28,843 --> 02:05:29,719
Trust me.

1487
02:05:31,903 --> 02:05:32,999
Trust me.

1488
02:05:52,903 --> 02:05:53,991
Good evening, Draco.

1489
02:05:55,608 --> 02:05:58,834
What brings you here
on this fine spring evening?

1490
02:05:59,099 --> 02:06:00,806
Who else is here?
I heard you talking.

1491
02:06:00,841 --> 02:06:04,747
I often talk aloud to myself.
I find it extraordinarily useful.

1492
02:06:06,874 --> 02:06:08,815
Have you always been
to yourself, Draco?

1493
02:06:11,932 --> 02:06:16,077
Draco,
you are no assassin.

1494
02:06:16,186 --> 02:06:17,288
How do you know
what I am?

1495
02:06:17,457 --> 02:06:18,772
I've done things
that would shock you.

1496
02:06:18,807 --> 02:06:21,316
Oh, like cursing Katie Bell
and hoping that in return

1497
02:06:21,351 --> 02:06:23,021
she would bear
a cursed necklace to me?

1498
02:06:23,106 --> 02:06:25,827
Like replacing a bottle of mead
with one lace with poison.

1499
02:06:25,862 --> 02:06:28,480
Forgive me, Draco,
I cannot help feel

1500
02:06:28,515 --> 02:06:30,085
these actions are so weak
that your...

1501
02:06:30,284 --> 02:06:32,013
heart can't
really have been in.

1502
02:06:32,072 --> 02:06:34,375
He trusts me.
I was chosen.

1503
02:06:39,316 --> 02:06:40,921
I shall make it
easy for you.

1504
02:06:40,956 --> 02:06:41,800
Expelliarmus!

1505
02:06:45,583 --> 02:06:47,927
Very good.
Very good.

1506
02:06:49,701 --> 02:06:50,617
You're not alone.

1507
02:06:52,010 --> 02:06:53,074
There are others.

1508
02:06:55,165 --> 02:06:55,883
How?

1509
02:06:57,672 --> 02:06:59,553
The Vanishing Cabinet
in the Room of Requirement.

1510
02:07:00,995 --> 02:07:02,062
I've been mending it.

1511
02:07:02,126 --> 02:07:05,842
Let me guess, it has a sister.
A twin.

1512
02:07:06,128 --> 02:07:07,195
In Borgin and Burkes.

1513
02:07:07,570 --> 02:07:09,961
- They form a passage.
- Ingenious.

1514
02:07:11,019 --> 02:07:17,556
Draco, years ago, I knew a boy
who made all the wrong choices.

1515
02:07:18,984 --> 02:07:20,347
Please let me
help you.

1516
02:07:20,388 --> 02:07:21,312
I don't want your help.

1517
02:07:22,693 --> 02:07:25,693
Don't you understand?
I have to do this.

1518
02:07:27,209 --> 02:07:28,602
I have to kill you.

1519
02:07:29,504 --> 02:07:30,794
Or he's gonna kill me.

1520
02:07:40,464 --> 02:07:43,468
Oh,
look what we have here.

1521
02:07:45,786 --> 02:07:47,639
Well done, Draco.

1522
02:07:51,360 --> 02:07:52,591
Good evening, Bellatrix.

1523
02:07:54,181 --> 02:07:56,257
I think introductions aren't over,
don't you?

1524
02:07:56,440 --> 02:07:57,669
Love to, Albus,

1525
02:07:58,422 --> 02:08:00,540
but I'm afraid
we're on a bit of tight schedule.

1526
02:08:01,960 --> 02:08:02,896
Do it!

1527
02:08:04,548 --> 02:08:05,997
He doesn't have
the stomach.

1528
02:08:06,329 --> 02:08:07,789
Just like his father.

1529
02:08:08,766 --> 02:08:10,392
Let me finish him
in my own way.

1530
02:08:10,402 --> 02:08:13,485
No, the Dark Lord was clear
the boy has to do it.

1531
02:08:14,115 --> 02:08:16,407
This is your moment, Draco.
Do it!

1532
02:08:17,355 --> 02:08:21,115
Go on, Draco,
now!

1533
02:08:22,868 --> 02:08:23,474
No.

1534
02:08:35,477 --> 02:08:36,394
Severus.

1535
02:08:45,541 --> 02:08:46,247
Please...

1536
02:08:47,883 --> 02:08:49,165
Avada Kedavra.

1537
02:09:51,013 --> 02:09:52,809
Hagrid!

1538
02:09:54,397 --> 02:09:57,713
Snape,
he trusted you!

1539
02:10:02,484 --> 02:10:03,155
Go on!

1540
02:10:04,643 --> 02:10:05,644
Incarcerous!

1541
02:10:06,464 --> 02:10:09,426
Fight back, you coward!
Fight back!

1542
02:10:10,650 --> 02:10:13,933
No, he belongs
to the Dark Lord.

1543
02:10:32,975 --> 02:10:34,274
Sectumsempra!

1544
02:10:42,374 --> 02:10:46,703
You dare use my own spells
against me, Potter?

1545
02:10:48,051 --> 02:10:53,196
Yes,
I'm the Half-Blood Prince.

1546
02:14:32,227 --> 02:14:32,941
Potter...

1547
02:14:34,576 --> 02:14:36,333
Enlighten
what has happened.

1548
02:14:38,260 --> 02:14:40,927
If you should have the need
to talk to someone...

1549
02:14:43,094 --> 02:14:46,722
You should know...
Professor Dumbledore...

1550
02:14:48,946 --> 02:14:50,789
You meant
a great deal to him.

1551
02:15:08,853 --> 02:15:09,838
Do you think
he would have done it?

1552
02:15:11,109 --> 02:15:11,852
Draco.

1553
02:15:13,839 --> 02:15:14,645
No.

1554
02:15:16,337 --> 02:15:17,941
No, he was lowering
his wand.

1555
02:15:19,253 --> 02:15:20,534
In the end,
it was Snape.

1556
02:15:21,474 --> 02:15:23,023
It was always Snape.

1557
02:15:24,386 --> 02:15:25,406
I did nothing.

1558
02:15:32,671 --> 02:15:36,277
It was fake.
Open it.

1559
02:15:47,636 --> 02:15:48,964
To the Dark Lord:

1560
02:15:49,706 --> 02:15:51,452
I know I will be dead
long before you read this

1561
02:15:51,487 --> 02:15:52,188
but I want you
to know

1562
02:15:52,209 --> 02:15:53,905
that it was I
who discovered your secret.

1563
02:15:56,017 --> 02:15:57,663
I have stolen
the real Horcrux

1564
02:15:57,688 --> 02:15:59,703
and intend to destroy it
as soon as I can.

1565
02:15:59,877 --> 02:16:03,128
I face death in the hope
that when you meet your match,

1566
02:16:03,163 --> 02:16:04,603
you will be mortal
once more.

1567
02:16:06,342 --> 02:16:07,242
R.A.B.

1568
02:16:08,942 --> 02:16:11,691
- R.A.B.?
- Don't know.

1569
02:16:13,686 --> 02:16:16,239
But whoever they are,
they have the real Horcrux.

1570
02:16:17,578 --> 02:16:18,879
It means
it was all a waste.

1571
02:16:20,315 --> 02:16:21,179
All of it.

1572
02:16:27,676 --> 02:16:29,004
Ron's okay with you,
you know.

1573
02:16:29,970 --> 02:16:30,916
You and Ginny.

1574
02:16:32,251 --> 02:16:35,136
If I were you when he's around,
I'd keep snogging to a minimum.

1575
02:16:36,878 --> 02:16:38,446
I'm not coming back,
Hermione.

1576
02:16:40,037 --> 02:16:42,922
I got to finish
whatever Dumbledore started.

1577
02:16:43,014 --> 02:16:45,674
And I don't know
where that'll leave me,

1578
02:16:45,709 --> 02:16:47,704
but I'll let you and Ron
know where I am...

1579
02:16:47,721 --> 02:16:48,612
when I can.

1580
02:16:50,132 --> 02:16:52,209
I've always admired
your courage, Harry.

1581
02:16:53,214 --> 02:16:55,219
But sometimes,
you can be really thick.

1582
02:16:58,830 --> 02:17:00,280
You don't really think
you're going to be able

1583
02:17:00,315 --> 02:17:02,492
to find all those Horcruxes
by yourself, do you?

1584
02:17:07,314 --> 02:17:08,483
You need us, Harry.

1585
02:17:24,100 --> 02:17:26,398
I never realised
how beautiful this place was.

1586
