1
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:59,036
Our pasta this evening...

2
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,705
is squid ravioli
in a lemon grass broth...

3
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:06,001
with goat cheese profiteroles,
and I also have an arugula Caesar salad.

4
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:09,463
For entrees this evening, I have
swordfish meatloaf with onion marmalade,

5
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:12,883
rare roasted partridge breast in
raspberry coulis with a sorrel timbale.

6
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:16,178
...and grilled free-range rabbit
with herbed french fries.

7
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:20,057
Our pasta tonight is a squid ravioli
in a lemon grass broth.

8
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:28,774
God, I hate this place. It's a chick's
restaurant. Why aren't we at Dorsia ?

9
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:30,859
Because Bateman won't give
the maitre d' head.

10
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:35,948
Is that Reed Robinson
over there ?

11
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:39,076
- Are you freebasing or what ?
That's not Robinson. Well, who is it then ?

12
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:42,120
- It's Paul Allen.
- That's not Paul Allen.

13
00:02:42,204 --> 00:02:44,581
Paul Allen's on the other side
of the room over there.

14
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:46,667
Who's he with ?
Some weasel from Kicker Peabody.

15
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,585
They don't have a good bathroom
to do coke in.

16
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:51,547
Are you sure that's Paul Allen over there ?
Yes, McDufus, I am.

17
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,132
- He's handling the Fisher account.
- Lucky bastard.

18
00:02:54,216 --> 00:02:58,637
- Lucky Jew bastard.
- Jesus, McDermott, what does that have to do with anything ?

19
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,639
I've seen that bastard
sitting in his office...

20
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:02,808
talking on the phone to the C.E.O.s,
spinnin' a fuckin' menorah.

21
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:05,352
Not a menorah.
You spin a dreidel.

22
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:07,354
Oh, my God, Bateman.

23
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:10,440
Do you want me to fry you up some
fucking potato pancakes ? Some latkes ?

24
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:14,194
No, just... cool it with
the anti-Semitic remarks.

25
00:03:14,278 --> 00:03:18,407
Oh, I forgot. Bateman's dating someone
from the A.C.L.U.

26
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:21,368
He's the voice of reason.
The boy next door.

27
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:24,913
Speaking of reasonable--
Only $570.

28
00:03:24,997 --> 00:03:27,958
That's not bad.

29
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,085
A little something
for the purse.

30
00:03:30,169 --> 00:03:32,087
Give her the 50.

31
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:13,086
Stoli on the rocks.

32
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:16,507
These aren't good anymore.
It's a cash bar.

33
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,884
That'll be $25.

34
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:24,097
You're a fucking ugly bitch.

35
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:26,808
I wanna stab you to death...

36
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:29,436
and play around
with your blood.

37
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:42,324
What can I get
for you two ?

38
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,184
I live in the
American Gardens building...

39
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:11,770
on West 81st Street
on the 11th floor.

40
00:05:11,854 --> 00:05:14,982
My name is Patrick Bateman.

41
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:16,984
I'm 27 years old.

42
00:05:18,402 --> 00:05:20,362
I believe in
taking care of myself,

43
00:05:20,404 --> 00:05:25,367
in a balanced diet,
in a rigorous exercise routine.

44
00:05:25,409 --> 00:05:27,828
ln the morning,
if my face is a little pufffy,

45
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:30,998
I'll put on an icepack
while doing my stomach crunches.

46
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:33,000
I can do a thousand now.

47
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:54,563
After I remove the icepack,
I use a deeppore cleanser lotion.

48
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:57,900
In the shower, I use
a water-activated gel cleanser.

49
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:02,571
Then
a honey-almond bodyscrub.

50
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:06,408
And on the face,
an exfoliating gelscrub.

51
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:18,420
Then I apply
an herb mint facialmasque,

52
00:06:18,462 --> 00:06:22,508
which lleave on forten minutes
while I prepare the rest of my routine.

53
00:06:24,635 --> 00:06:29,097
I always use an aftershave lotion
with little or no alcohol,

54
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:32,935
because alcohol dries your face out
and makes you look older.

55
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:34,978
Then moisturizer,

56
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:37,022
then an anti-aging eye balm,

57
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:40,609
followed by a final
moisturizing protective lotion.

58
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:45,280
There is an idea
of a Patrick Bateman.

59
00:06:45,364 --> 00:06:49,493
Some kind of abstraction,
but there is no real me.

60
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:52,496
Only an entity--
something illusory.

61
00:06:52,538 --> 00:06:55,123
And though I can hide
my cold gaze...

62
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:58,377
and you can shake my hand
and feel flesh gripping yours...

63
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:03,257
and may be you can even sense
our life styles are probably comparable,

64
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:06,635
I simply am not there.

65
00:07:29,575 --> 00:07:31,535
Good morning.

66
00:07:31,577 --> 00:07:34,788
Good morning, Hamilton.
Nice tan.

67
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:43,547
Late.
Aerobics class. Sorry. Any messages ?

68
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:47,134
Ricky Harrison has to cancel.
He didn't say what he was cancelling or why.

69
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:50,637
I occasionally box with Ricky
at the Harvard Club. Anyone else ?

70
00:07:50,721 --> 00:07:53,974
Spencer wants to meet for drinks
at Fluties, Pier 17. When ?

71
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:57,102
After 6:00.
And what should I say ? Negative. Cancel it.

72
00:07:57,186 --> 00:08:01,023
Just say "no"
Just say "no" ?

73
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:02,816
Okay, Jean.

74
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,402
I need reservations for three
at Camols at 12:30,

75
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,404
and if not there
try Crayons.

76
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,990
Allright ?
Yes, sir.

77
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:15,454
Oh, wait. And I need reservations
for two at Arcadia at 8:00 on Thursday.

78
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:17,456
Something romantic ?

79
00:08:18,582 --> 00:08:20,626
No.

80
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:24,171
Silly. Forget it.
I'll make them.

81
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:26,215
No, I'll do it.
No, no.

82
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:30,469
Be a doll and just get me a mineral
water, okay ? You look nice today.

83
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:33,138
Don't wear that outfit again.

84
00:08:33,222 --> 00:08:35,182
What ? I didn't hear you.

85
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:37,893
I said, do not wear
that outfit again.

86
00:08:37,935 --> 00:08:40,979
Wear a dress, a skirt or something.
You don't like this, I take it.

87
00:08:41,063 --> 00:08:44,316
Come on.
You're prettier than that.

88
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,819
- Thanks, Patrick.
- I'm not here.

89
00:08:47,903 --> 00:08:52,658
And high heels.
I like high heels.

90
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,458
Feathered friends for 600.

91
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:03,836
During courtship,
the male frigate bird...

92
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:06,755
inflates to enormous size
the red pouch found here.

93
00:09:20,978 --> 00:09:23,605
And I want
hundreds of thousands of roses.

94
00:09:23,689 --> 00:09:26,024
And lots of
chocolate truffles,

95
00:09:26,108 --> 00:09:28,485
Godiva, and oysters
in the halfshell.

96
00:09:28,569 --> 00:09:31,488
I'm trying to listen to
the new Robert Palmer tape,

97
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:35,993
but Evelyn, my supposed fiance,
keeps buzzing in my ear.

98
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:39,454
Annie Leibovitz.
We'll get Annie Leibovitz.

99
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:41,832
And we'll have to get
someone to videotape.

100
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:45,127
Patrick,
we should do it.

101
00:09:45,169 --> 00:09:48,630
Do what ?
Get married. Have a wedding.

102
00:09:48,672 --> 00:09:50,883
No. I can't take
the time off work.

103
00:09:50,966 --> 00:09:53,385
Your father practically owns the company.
You can do anything you like, silly.

104
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:56,180
- I don't want to talk about it.
- I hate that job anyway.

105
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:58,182
I don't see why
you just don't quit.

106
00:09:58,265 --> 00:10:02,769
Because I want to fit in.

107
00:10:13,322 --> 00:10:15,991
Williams party.

108
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:19,036
I'm on the verge of tears
by the time we arrive at Espace,

109
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:22,080
since I'm positive
we won't have a decent table.

110
00:10:22,164 --> 00:10:26,668
But we do, and relief washes over me
in an awesome wave.

111
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:31,006
Patrick, this is my cousin Vanden
and her boyfriend Stash.

112
00:10:31,048 --> 00:10:33,383
They're both artists.
The menu's in braille.

113
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:37,012
I see you've met everyone.
You look awful.

114
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:40,349
Okay. Allright.

115
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,476
I'm fairly certain that...

116
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,938
Timothy Bryce and Evelyn
are having an affair.

117
00:10:46,021 --> 00:10:48,857
Timothy is the only
interesting person I know.

118
00:10:48,941 --> 00:10:52,402
I'm almost completely indifferent
as to whether Evelyn knows...

119
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:57,533
I'm having an affair with Courtney
Rawlinson, her closest friend.

120
00:10:57,574 --> 00:10:59,576
Courtney is almost
perfect looking.

121
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:03,205
She's usually operating on
one or more psychiatric drugs.

122
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:05,707
Tonight, I believe, it's Xanax.
Mmm. Oh.

123
00:11:05,749 --> 00:11:08,919
More disturbing than her drug use,
though, is the fact that she's engaged...

124
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:12,548
to Luis Carruthers, the biggest doofus
in the business.

125
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:14,883
Tell me, Stash.

126
00:11:14,967 --> 00:11:18,512
Do you think Soho is becoming too...
commercial ?

127
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:21,890
- Yes. I read that.
- Oh, who gives a rat's ass ?

128
00:11:21,974 --> 00:11:23,934
Hey, that affects us.

129
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:27,980
Well, what about the massacres in Sri
Lanka, honey ? Doesn't that affect us too ?

130
00:11:28,063 --> 00:11:29,982
Do you know anything about
Sri Lanka ?

131
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:32,150
How, like, the Sikhs are killing
tons of Israelis over there ?

132
00:11:32,234 --> 00:11:34,236
Come on, Bryce.

133
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:37,656
There are a lot more important problems
than Sri Lanka to worry about.

134
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:41,326
- Like what ?
- Well, we have to end apartheid, for one,

135
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:46,748
slow down the nuclear arms race,
stop terrorism and world hunger.

136
00:11:46,832 --> 00:11:50,627
We have to provide food and shelter
for the homeless...

137
00:11:50,711 --> 00:11:54,923
and oppose racial discrimination
and promote civil rights,

138
00:11:54,965 --> 00:11:57,801
while also promoting
equal rights for women.

139
00:11:57,885 --> 00:12:00,262
We have to encourage
a return...

140
00:12:00,304 --> 00:12:02,973
to traditional moral values.

141
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:05,434
Most importantly,

142
00:12:05,517 --> 00:12:09,813
we have to promote
general social concern...

143
00:12:09,897 --> 00:12:13,775
and less materialism
in young people.

144
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:17,613
Patrick,
how thought provoking.

145
00:12:54,024 --> 00:12:55,984
Hello.

146
00:12:57,819 --> 00:12:59,780
Hello.

147
00:13:17,756 --> 00:13:20,509
Bleaching ? Are you
trying to say "bleaching" ?

148
00:13:20,592 --> 00:13:22,511
Oh, my God.
Two things.

149
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:24,513
One: You can't bleach a Cerruti.
Out of the question.

150
00:13:24,596 --> 00:13:27,516
Two: I can only get
these sheets in Santa Fe.

151
00:13:27,558 --> 00:13:29,560
These are very expensive sheets,
and I really need them cleaned.

152
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:33,188
Lady, if you don't shut your
fucking mouth, I will kill you.

153
00:13:33,272 --> 00:13:34,815
Now, listen.

154
00:13:34,898 --> 00:13:37,442
I have a lunch meeting at Hubert's
in 20 minutes with Ronald Harrison.

155
00:13:37,526 --> 00:13:39,444
I need those sheets
cleaned by this afternoon.

156
00:13:39,528 --> 00:13:42,865
Listen, I can't understand you !
This is crazy ! You're a fool.

157
00:13:42,948 --> 00:13:44,908
I can't cope with this
stupid "bitchee" !

158
00:13:44,992 --> 00:13:47,494
Understand ?
Christ. Patrick ?

159
00:13:47,578 --> 00:13:50,038
Hi, Patrick.

160
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:53,250
I thought that was you.
Hello. This is--

161
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:56,670
Isn't it ridiculous, coming all the way up here ?
They really are the best.

162
00:13:56,712 --> 00:13:58,755
Then why can't they
get these stains out ?

163
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:02,259
I mean, can you talk to these people
or something ? I'm not getting anywhere.

164
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:05,262
- Oh, what are those ?
- Well, it's--

165
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:08,515
- Cranberry juice. Cranapple.
- Really ?

166
00:14:08,557 --> 00:14:11,351
Listen, if you could talk to them,
I would really appreciate it.

167
00:14:11,393 --> 00:14:14,521
I'm really late. I have a lunch
appointment at Hubert's in 15 minutes.

168
00:14:14,563 --> 00:14:16,899
Hubert's ?
That moved uptown, right ? Oh, boy.

169
00:14:16,982 --> 00:14:19,234
Listen, I've gotta go.
Thank you, Victoria.

170
00:14:19,318 --> 00:14:21,278
Maybe we could do lunch
one day next week.

171
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:24,948
I'm downtown quite often. What about
a Saturday ? I'm at work all the time.

172
00:14:26,283 --> 00:14:28,619
Next Saturday ?
Can't, I'm afraid. Sure.

173
00:14:28,702 --> 00:14:30,871
At a matinee of LesMis.
Listen, I really gotta go.

174
00:14:30,913 --> 00:14:34,750
Oh, Christ.
I'll call you. Okay. Do.

175
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:36,835
Listen, you're dating Lewis,
he's in Arizona.

176
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:38,837
You're fucking me,
and we haven't made plans.

177
00:14:38,921 --> 00:14:40,756
What could you possibly
be up to tonight ?

178
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:43,675
Stop it. I'm--
On a lot of lithium ?

179
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:47,054
Waiting for Luis to call me.
He said he'd call tonight.

180
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:50,724
Pumpkin ? Pumpkin,
you're dating an asshole.

181
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:54,603
Mm-hmm. Pumpkin, you're dating the
biggest dickweed in New York.

182
00:14:54,686 --> 00:14:58,815
Pumpkin, you're dating
a tumbling, tumbling dickweed.

183
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:01,985
Patrick, stop calling me
pumpkin, okay ?

184
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:05,447
I have to go.
Courtney ?

185
00:15:05,531 --> 00:15:07,449
Hmm ?
Dinner.

186
00:15:07,533 --> 00:15:10,077
I can't.
I'm thinking Dorsia.

187
00:15:12,287 --> 00:15:15,499
Dorsia's nice.
Wear something fabulous.

188
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:17,584
Oh,yeah !

189
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:29,847
Dorsia.

190
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:32,099
Um, yes, I know
it's a little late,

191
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:36,812
but is it possible to reserve a
table for two at 8:00 or 8:30, perhaps ?

192
00:15:53,996 --> 00:15:57,457
...a facialat Elizabeth Arden,
which was really relaxing.

193
00:15:57,499 --> 00:16:00,752
And then,
to the Pottery Barn,

194
00:16:00,836 --> 00:16:04,173
where I got this little...

195
00:16:04,214 --> 00:16:07,634
silver muffin dish.
Is that Donald Trump's car ?

196
00:16:07,676 --> 00:16:09,720
God, Patrick.
Shut up.

197
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:12,556
You know, Courtney, you should
take some more lithium or have a Diet Coke.

198
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,517
Some caffeine might get you
out of this slump.

199
00:16:15,601 --> 00:16:18,312
I just want a child.

200
00:16:18,353 --> 00:16:20,981
Just two...

201
00:16:21,064 --> 00:16:23,609
perfect...

202
00:16:23,692 --> 00:16:26,028
children.

203
00:16:30,073 --> 00:16:32,743
Are we here ?
Yeah.

204
00:16:40,334 --> 00:16:43,712
This is Dorsia ?
Yes, dear.

205
00:16:43,795 --> 00:16:46,507
Courtney, you're gonna have
the peanut butter soup...

206
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:49,176
with smoked duck
and mashed squash.

207
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:53,138
New York Matinee called it
"a playful but mysterious little dish."

208
00:16:53,222 --> 00:16:57,059
You'll love it. And then the red
snapper with violets and pine nuts.

209
00:16:57,142 --> 00:16:59,061
I think that'll
follow nicely.

210
00:16:59,144 --> 00:17:02,940
Mmm.
Thanks, Patrick.

211
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:11,990
Patrick, thanks so much
for looking after Courtney.

212
00:17:12,074 --> 00:17:14,910
Dorsia.
How impressive.

213
00:17:14,993 --> 00:17:17,204
How on Earth did you get
a reservation there ?

214
00:17:17,246 --> 00:17:19,540
Lucky, I guess.

215
00:17:19,623 --> 00:17:21,583
That's a wonderful suit.

216
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:23,961
Don't tell me. Don't tell me.
Let me guess.

217
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:27,047
Mmm, Valentino Couture ?

218
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:29,216
Uh-huh.
Hmm.

219
00:17:29,258 --> 00:17:32,386
It looks so soft.
Your compliment was sufficient, Luis.

220
00:17:34,221 --> 00:17:39,309
Hello, Halberstram. Nice tie.
How the hell are you ?

221
00:17:39,393 --> 00:17:42,688
Allen has mistaken me for this
dickhead, Marcus Halberstram.

222
00:17:42,771 --> 00:17:45,357
It seems logical because
Marcus also works at P&P,

223
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,901
and in fact does
the same exact thing I do.

224
00:17:47,943 --> 00:17:51,947
He also has a penchant for Valentino suits
and Oliver Peoples glasses.

225
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,949
Marcus and I
even go to the same barber,

226
00:17:54,032 --> 00:17:56,243
although I have
a slightly better haircut.

227
00:17:56,285 --> 00:17:59,663
- How's the Ransom account going, Marcus ?
- It's, uh, all right.

228
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:02,082
Really ? That's interesting.
It's not, uh, not great.

229
00:18:02,124 --> 00:18:04,835
- Oh, well, you know.
- So, how's Cecilia ?

230
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:07,588
- She's a great girl.
- Oh, yeah. I'm very lucky.

231
00:18:07,671 --> 00:18:10,757
- Mm-hmm.
- Hey, Allen, congratulations on the Fisher account.

232
00:18:10,841 --> 00:18:14,303
- Thankyou, Baxter.
- Listen, Paul. Squash.

233
00:18:18,473 --> 00:18:21,643
Call me.
How about Friday ?

234
00:18:21,727 --> 00:18:26,148
No can do.
I got an 8:30 res at Dorsia.

235
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:29,693
Greatsea urchin ceviche.

236
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:31,778
Dorsia on Friday night ?
How'd he swing that ?

237
00:18:31,862 --> 00:18:33,864
I think he's lying.

238
00:18:36,325 --> 00:18:39,661
- Is that a gram ?
- New card.

239
00:18:39,745 --> 00:18:42,664
What do you think ?

240
00:18:42,748 --> 00:18:45,334
Whoa-ho.
Very nice.

241
00:18:45,417 --> 00:18:49,338
Look at that. Picked them up from
the printer's yesterday.

242
00:18:49,421 --> 00:18:51,340
Good coloring.
That's bone.

243
00:18:51,423 --> 00:18:53,967
And the lettering is something
called Silian Rail.

244
00:18:54,009 --> 00:18:57,513
It's very cool, Bateman,
but that's nothing. Look at this.

245
00:18:57,596 --> 00:18:59,973
That is really nice.

246
00:19:00,015 --> 00:19:03,977
Eggshell with Romalian type.
What do you think ?

247
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:06,897
Nice.

248
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:11,485
Jesus. That is really super.
How'da nitwit like you get so tasteful?

249
00:19:11,568 --> 00:19:14,071
I can't believe that Bryce...

250
00:19:14,154 --> 00:19:17,074
prefers Van Patten's card
to mine.

251
00:19:17,157 --> 00:19:20,035
But wait.
You ain't seen nothin' yet.

252
00:19:21,787 --> 00:19:27,376
Raised lettering,
pale nimbus... white.

253
00:19:27,459 --> 00:19:30,003
Impressive.
Very nice.

254
00:19:30,087 --> 00:19:32,130
Hmm.

255
00:19:32,214 --> 00:19:34,424
Let's see Paul Allen's card.

256
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:50,858
Look at that subtle
off-white coloring.

257
00:19:50,899 --> 00:19:53,819
The tasteful thickness of it.

258
00:19:53,902 --> 00:19:57,114
Oh, my God.
It even has a watermark.

259
00:20:01,869 --> 00:20:04,371
Is something wrong,
Patrick ?

260
00:20:04,454 --> 00:20:06,415
You're sweating.

261
00:20:34,776 --> 00:20:37,529
Hello. Pat Bateman.

262
00:20:37,613 --> 00:20:39,615
You want some, uh, money ?

263
00:20:39,698 --> 00:20:41,617
Some food ?

264
00:20:43,952 --> 00:20:46,455
- Is this what you need ?
- I'm-I'm hungry.

265
00:20:46,497 --> 00:20:48,457
Yeah.
Cold out too, isn't it ?

266
00:20:53,295 --> 00:20:56,590
Why don't you get a job ?
If you're so hungry, why don't you get a job ?

267
00:20:56,632 --> 00:20:58,634
I lost my job.

268
00:20:58,675 --> 00:21:00,677
Why ? You drinking ?

269
00:21:00,802 --> 00:21:04,473
Is that why you lost it ?
Insider trading ?

270
00:21:04,556 --> 00:21:06,767
Just joking.

271
00:21:06,808 --> 00:21:09,937
Listen, what's your name ?
Al.

272
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,980
Hmm ? Speak up.
Come on. Al.

273
00:21:12,022 --> 00:21:14,274
Get a goddamn job, Al.

274
00:21:14,358 --> 00:21:17,486
You got a negative attitude.
That's what's stopping you.

275
00:21:17,569 --> 00:21:21,114
You gotta get your act together.
I'll help you.

276
00:21:21,198 --> 00:21:24,993
You are so kind, mister.
You're a kind-- You're a kind man.

277
00:21:25,077 --> 00:21:26,995
It's okay.
I can tell.

278
00:21:27,079 --> 00:21:30,415
Please, you gotta tell me
what to do. You gotta help me.

279
00:21:30,499 --> 00:21:33,460
I'm so cold,
I'm hungry.

280
00:21:33,502 --> 00:21:36,129
You know how bad you smell ?

281
00:21:36,171 --> 00:21:39,299
You reek of shit.
Do you know that ?

282
00:21:39,383 --> 00:21:42,719
Al.

283
00:21:42,803 --> 00:21:45,806
I'm sorry.
It's just that--

284
00:21:45,848 --> 00:21:47,808
I don't know.

285
00:21:49,059 --> 00:21:51,436
I don't have anything
in common with you.

286
00:21:59,695 --> 00:22:02,322
Oh. Oh, thankyou, mister.
Thankyou.

287
00:22:02,406 --> 00:22:05,534
I'm cold out here.

288
00:22:05,617 --> 00:22:07,536
You know what a fucking loser you are ?
What ?

289
00:22:33,103 --> 00:22:35,856
What beautiful skin you have,
Mr. Bateman.

290
00:22:35,939 --> 00:22:39,151
So fine,
so smooth.

291
00:22:46,742 --> 00:22:49,203
I have all the characteristics
of a human being--

292
00:22:49,244 --> 00:22:52,873
flesh, blood, skin, hair--

293
00:22:52,915 --> 00:22:56,210
but not a single, clear,
identifiable emotion,

294
00:22:56,251 --> 00:22:59,713
except for greed and disgust.

295
00:22:59,755 --> 00:23:02,424
Something horrible
is happening inside of me,

296
00:23:02,508 --> 00:23:04,426
and I don't know why.

297
00:23:05,928 --> 00:23:09,640
My nightly bloodlust
has overflowed into my days.

298
00:23:09,723 --> 00:23:13,435
I feel lethal,
on the verge of frenzy.

299
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:16,730
I think my mask of sanity
is about to slip.

300
00:23:29,117 --> 00:23:32,037
Hey, Mc Cloy,
what do you say ?

301
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,581
Hey, Hamilton.
Have a holly, jolly Christmas.

302
00:23:34,665 --> 00:23:38,919
Is Allen still handling the Fisher account ?
Ofcourse. Who else ?

303
00:23:39,002 --> 00:23:41,964
Mistletoe alert.
Merry Xmas, Patrick.

304
00:23:42,047 --> 00:23:44,591
Merry Xmas, Harry.
Merry Christmas.

305
00:23:44,633 --> 00:23:46,927
You're late, honey.
Oh, yes, you are. I'm not late.

306
00:23:46,969 --> 00:23:50,097
I've been here the entire time.
You just didn't see me.

307
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:54,268
Say hello to Snowball.
Snowball says, "Merry Christmas, Patrick."

308
00:23:54,351 --> 00:23:57,813
What is it ?
It's a little baby piggly-wiggly, isn't it ?

309
00:23:57,855 --> 00:24:00,315
It's a Vietnamese
potbellied pig.

310
00:24:00,399 --> 00:24:02,734
They make darling pets.
Don't you ?

311
00:24:02,818 --> 00:24:05,112
Don't you ?

312
00:24:05,195 --> 00:24:08,240
Stop scowling, Patrick.
You're such a grinch.

313
00:24:08,323 --> 00:24:10,534
And what does Mr. Grinch
want for Christmas ?

314
00:24:10,617 --> 00:24:12,870
And don't say
breast implants again.

315
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:18,458
Allen. Marcus.
Merry Christmas.

316
00:24:18,542 --> 00:24:21,628
How you been ? Workaholic, I suppose ?
Haven't seen you in a while.

317
00:24:21,712 --> 00:24:25,799
Hey, Hamilton. We're goin' to Nell's.
Limo's out front.

318
00:24:25,841 --> 00:24:29,136
We should have dinner.
Maybe you could bring--

319
00:24:29,219 --> 00:24:32,097
Cecilla ?
Yes, Cecilla.

320
00:24:32,181 --> 00:24:34,474
Oh, Cecilla would adore it.

321
00:24:34,516 --> 00:24:37,186
Well, then,
let's do it, Marcus.

322
00:24:37,269 --> 00:24:39,271
Great party.
Thanks.

323
00:24:39,354 --> 00:24:41,523
Patrick, why is he
calling you Marcus ?

324
00:24:41,607 --> 00:24:44,234
Mistletoe alert.

325
00:24:52,534 --> 00:24:55,078
Marcus Halberstram
for two at 7:00.

326
00:24:57,247 --> 00:25:00,834
No, l want to know, okay ?
I came here for the cilantro crawfish gumbo,

327
00:25:00,876 --> 00:25:04,505
which is, after all, the only excuse
one could have for being in this restaurant,

328
00:25:04,588 --> 00:25:07,007
which is, by the way,
almost completely empty.

329
00:25:07,049 --> 00:25:10,552
I'm very sorry, sir.
J&B straight, and a Corona.

330
00:25:10,636 --> 00:25:13,347
Would you like to hear--
Double Absolut martini.

331
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:15,474
Yes, sir.
Would you like to hear the specials ?

332
00:25:15,557 --> 00:25:17,976
Not if you want
to keep your spleen.

333
00:25:21,438 --> 00:25:25,067
This is a real beehive of activity, Halberstram.
This place is hot.

334
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:29,029
Very hot.
Listen, the mud soup and charcoal arugula...

335
00:25:29,071 --> 00:25:31,031
are outrageous here.

336
00:25:31,073 --> 00:25:33,408
Yeah, well, you're late.
Hey, I'm a child ofdivorce.

337
00:25:33,492 --> 00:25:36,036
Give me a break.

338
00:25:36,078 --> 00:25:41,375
I see they've omitted the pork loin
with lime Jell-O. We should've gone to Dorsia.

339
00:25:41,416 --> 00:25:44,127
I could've gotten us a table.
Nobody goes there anymore.

340
00:25:45,921 --> 00:25:48,882
Is that Ivana Trump ?

341
00:25:48,924 --> 00:25:52,845
Oh, geez, Patrick. I mean, Marcus.
What are you thinking ?

342
00:25:52,928 --> 00:25:56,682
Why would Ivana
be at Texarkana ?

343
00:25:56,765 --> 00:26:00,769
So, uh, wasn't Rothchild originally
handling the Fisher account ?

344
00:26:00,853 --> 00:26:05,440
How'd you get it ?
Well, I could tell you that, Halberstram,

345
00:26:05,524 --> 00:26:07,860
but then I'd have to
kill you.

346
00:26:14,533 --> 00:26:18,412
I like to dissect girls.
Did you know I'm utterly insane ?

347
00:26:21,373 --> 00:26:23,709
Great tan, Marcus.
I mean, really impressive.

348
00:26:23,792 --> 00:26:25,586
Where do you tan ?
Salon.

349
00:26:25,627 --> 00:26:27,921
I've got a tanning bed at home.
You should look into it.

350
00:26:27,963 --> 00:26:31,258
And, uh, Cecilla.

351
00:26:31,341 --> 00:26:33,635
How is she ?
Where is she tonight ?

352
00:26:33,719 --> 00:26:36,638
Cecilla's, uh--
Well, you know Cecilla.

353
00:26:36,722 --> 00:26:39,391
I think she's having dinner
with, um, Evelyn Williams.

354
00:26:39,474 --> 00:26:42,311
Evelyn ?
Great ass.

355
00:26:42,394 --> 00:26:46,064
Goes out with that loser
Patrick Bateman. What a dork.

356
00:26:46,148 --> 00:26:49,276
Another martini, Paul ?

357
00:26:55,032 --> 00:26:56,992
You like
Huey Lewis and the News ?

358
00:26:57,034 --> 00:26:59,244
Um, they're okay.

359
00:27:01,288 --> 00:27:05,042
They're early work was a little
too new wave for my taste.

360
00:27:05,125 --> 00:27:08,086
But when Sports
came out in '83,

361
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:11,173
I think they really came into their own,
commercially and artistically.

362
00:27:14,426 --> 00:27:17,137
The whole album has
a clear, crisp sound,

363
00:27:17,221 --> 00:27:19,890
and a new sheen of
consummate professionalism...

364
00:27:19,973 --> 00:27:23,185
that really gives the songs
a big boost.

365
00:27:32,444 --> 00:27:34,905
He's been compared
to Elvis Costello,

366
00:27:34,988 --> 00:27:39,660
but I think Huey has a far more bitter,
cynical sense of humor.

367
00:27:39,701 --> 00:27:41,662
Hey, Halberstram ?
Yes, Allen ?

368
00:27:41,703 --> 00:27:44,623
Why are there copies of the Style
section all over the place ?

369
00:27:44,706 --> 00:27:49,545
Do you-- Do you have a dog ?
A little chow or something ?

370
00:27:49,586 --> 00:27:52,506
- No, Allen.
- Is that a raincoat ?

371
00:27:52,548 --> 00:27:54,842
Yes, it is.

372
00:27:54,883 --> 00:27:57,469
In '87, Huey released this--

373
00:27:57,553 --> 00:27:59,471
Fore, their most
accomplished album.

374
00:27:59,555 --> 00:28:03,225
I think their undisputed
masterpiece is "Hip To Be Square."

375
00:28:03,308 --> 00:28:06,061
The song's so catchy, most people
probably don't listen to the lyrics.

376
00:28:06,144 --> 00:28:08,605
But they should,
because it's not just about...

377
00:28:08,689 --> 00:28:11,567
the pleasures of conformity
and the importance of trends.

378
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:15,863
It's also a personal statement
about the band itself. Hey, Paul !

379
00:28:21,285 --> 00:28:24,413
Try getting a reservation
at Dorsia now,

380
00:28:24,496 --> 00:28:27,583
you fuckin' stupid bastard !

381
00:28:27,666 --> 00:28:31,628
You fucking bastard !

382
00:29:30,896 --> 00:29:34,483
He was completely naked
and standing up on the table.

383
00:29:34,566 --> 00:29:37,027
He had no clothes on
what so ever, and he--

384
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:39,029
Patrick ?
Patrick.

385
00:29:39,112 --> 00:29:41,698
Is that you ?

386
00:29:41,782 --> 00:29:45,035
No, Luis, it's not me.
You're mistaken.

387
00:29:45,118 --> 00:29:47,204
This is my very good friend,
Patrick Bateman.

388
00:29:47,287 --> 00:29:51,458
Where are you going ? We're going to Nell's.
Gwendolyn's father is buying it.

389
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:54,294
Ooh.

390
00:29:55,838 --> 00:29:57,756
Where did you get
that overnight bag ?

391
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,219
Jean-Paul Gaultier.

392
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,399
When I get
to Paul Allen's place,

393
00:30:15,482 --> 00:30:17,442
I use the keys
I took from his pocket...

394
00:30:17,526 --> 00:30:19,528
before disposing
of the body.

395
00:30:19,611 --> 00:30:22,739
There is a moment
of sheer panic...

396
00:30:22,823 --> 00:30:27,202
when I realize that Paul's
apartment overlooks the park...

397
00:30:27,286 --> 00:30:29,955
and is obviously
more expensive than mine.

398
00:30:33,208 --> 00:30:35,919
I calm myself
and move into the bedroom,

399
00:30:36,003 --> 00:30:39,173
where I find his suitcase
and start to pack.

400
00:30:39,214 --> 00:30:42,050
It's time for Paul
to take a little trip.

401
00:30:44,928 --> 00:30:47,181
Where do I send the bastard ?

402
00:30:47,222 --> 00:30:49,224
Dallas ?

403
00:30:49,266 --> 00:30:51,810
Paris ? Singapore ?

404
00:30:51,894 --> 00:30:55,022
London ? I'll send
the asshole to London.

405
00:31:00,068 --> 00:31:03,530
Hi. This is Paul.

406
00:31:03,572 --> 00:31:05,699
I've been called away
to London for a few days.

407
00:31:05,741 --> 00:31:09,036
Meredith, I'll call you when I get back.
Hasta la vista, baby.

408
00:31:34,603 --> 00:31:36,563
What is it ?

409
00:31:36,605 --> 00:31:40,317
Patrick.
Yes, Jean ?

410
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:43,570
There's a Mr. Donald Kimball
here to see you. Who ?

411
00:31:43,654 --> 00:31:46,240
Detective Donald Kimball.

412
00:31:49,284 --> 00:31:51,328
Tell him I'm at lunch.

413
00:31:51,411 --> 00:31:55,874
Patrick, it's only 10:30.
I think he knows you're here.

414
00:31:55,958 --> 00:31:58,293
Send him in, I guess.

415
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:09,179
Now, John, you've gotta wear clothes
in proportion to your physique.

416
00:32:09,263 --> 00:32:13,100
There are definite do's and don'ts, good buddy,
of wearing a bold-striped shirt.

417
00:32:13,141 --> 00:32:15,519
A bold-striped shirt
calls for solid-colored...

418
00:32:15,602 --> 00:32:18,021
or discreetly patterned
suits and ties.

419
00:32:18,105 --> 00:32:21,525
Yes, always tip the stylist
15 percent.

420
00:32:21,608 --> 00:32:25,404
Listen,John, I've gotta go.
T. Boone Pickens just walked in.

421
00:32:25,487 --> 00:32:30,159
Just joking. No, don't tip
the owner of the salon.

422
00:32:30,242 --> 00:32:32,161
Okay, John ? Right.

423
00:32:32,244 --> 00:32:35,455
Got it.
Sorry about that.

424
00:32:35,497 --> 00:32:38,125
No, I'm sorry.
I should've made an appointment.

425
00:32:38,167 --> 00:32:40,127
Was that anything important ?

426
00:32:40,169 --> 00:32:43,255
Oh, that ?
Just mulling over business problems,

427
00:32:43,338 --> 00:32:47,718
examining opportunities, exchanging rumors,
spreading gossip.

428
00:32:47,801 --> 00:32:50,971
Hi.

429
00:32:51,054 --> 00:32:54,016
I'm Donald Kimball.
Hi. Pat Bateman.

430
00:32:54,057 --> 00:32:56,310
Nice to meet you. Sorry to barge
in on you like this.

431
00:32:56,351 --> 00:32:58,395
I know how busy
you guys can get.

432
00:33:01,106 --> 00:33:05,152
So, what's the, uh,
topic of discussion ?

433
00:33:05,235 --> 00:33:07,696
I've been hired
by Meredith Powell...

434
00:33:07,779 --> 00:33:10,824
to investigate the disappearance
of Paul Allen.

435
00:33:12,743 --> 00:33:15,162
I see, yeah.
Paul's disappearance, yeah.

436
00:33:15,204 --> 00:33:17,331
So it's nothing
that official.

437
00:33:17,372 --> 00:33:20,584
- I just have some questions about
Paul Allen and yourself. - Coffee ?

438
00:33:20,667 --> 00:33:22,794
- No, I'm okay.
- Apollinaris ?

439
00:33:22,878 --> 00:33:24,796
No, I'm okay.

440
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,424
Can you bring Mr.--

441
00:33:27,508 --> 00:33:30,177
Kimball. No, I'm okay.
Mr. Kimball a bottle of Apollinaris.

442
00:33:30,219 --> 00:33:32,346
It's no problem.

443
00:33:34,681 --> 00:33:37,142
So, what's the topic
of discussion ?

444
00:33:37,226 --> 00:33:39,937
The disappearance
of Paul Allen.

445
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:43,649
Uh-huh, right.
Well, I, um, haven't--

446
00:33:45,567 --> 00:33:48,362
I haven't heard anything about
the disappearance or anything.

447
00:33:48,445 --> 00:33:50,614
Not on page six, at least.

448
00:33:50,697 --> 00:33:54,368
- I think his family wants this kept quiet.
- Understandable. Lime ?

449
00:33:54,409 --> 00:33:58,455
- No, really, I'm okay.
- You sure ? I can always get you a lime.

450
00:33:58,539 --> 00:34:01,542
Just some preliminary questions that I need
for my own files, okay ?

451
00:34:01,625 --> 00:34:03,585
Shoot.

452
00:34:03,627 --> 00:34:06,129
Hold old are you ?
Twenty-seven.

453
00:34:06,213 --> 00:34:08,131
Where did you go to school ?
Harvard.

454
00:34:08,215 --> 00:34:10,843
Then Harvard Business School.
Your address ?

455
00:34:10,926 --> 00:34:13,136
The American Gardens Building,
West 81st Street.

456
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:16,723
- Nice. Very nice.
- Thanks.

457
00:34:16,807 --> 00:34:20,519
What can you tell me about Paul Allen ?
I'm at a loss.

458
00:34:20,602 --> 00:34:23,480
He was part of that whole Yale thing.
"Yale thing" ?

459
00:34:23,564 --> 00:34:26,400
- Yeah, Yale thing.
- What do you mean, "Yale thing" ?

460
00:34:26,441 --> 00:34:30,404
Well, I think for one that he was probably
a closet homosexual...

461
00:34:30,487 --> 00:34:32,447
who did a lot of cocaine.

462
00:34:32,489 --> 00:34:34,575
That "Yale thing."

463
00:34:34,658 --> 00:34:38,871
What kind of man was he, besides
the information you've just given ?

464
00:34:38,954 --> 00:34:41,748
- I hope I'm not being cross-examined here.
- You feel like that ?

465
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:43,917
No, not really.

466
00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:47,838
Where did Paul hang out ?

467
00:34:47,921 --> 00:34:49,840
Hang out ?
Yeah, you know, hang out.

468
00:34:49,923 --> 00:34:54,094
Let me think.
Um, the Newport, Harry's,

469
00:34:54,178 --> 00:34:56,138
Fluties, Indochine,

470
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:58,140
Nell's, the Cornell Club,

471
00:34:58,182 --> 00:35:00,601
the New York Yacht Club.
He had a yacht ?

472
00:35:00,642 --> 00:35:04,605
- No, he just hung out there.
- And where did he go to school ?

473
00:35:04,688 --> 00:35:07,191
Don't you know this ?

474
00:35:07,274 --> 00:35:09,234
I just wanted to know
if you know.

475
00:35:13,322 --> 00:35:16,408
Before Yale, if I remember correctly,
St. Paul's.

476
00:35:16,492 --> 00:35:19,453
Listen, I just--
I just wanna help.

477
00:35:19,495 --> 00:35:22,539
I understand.

478
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,960
Do you have any witnesses
or fingerprints ?

479
00:35:27,002 --> 00:35:31,131
Well, there's a message on his answering
machine that says he went to London.

480
00:35:31,215 --> 00:35:33,759
- Well, maybe he did, huh ?
- His girlfriend doesn't think so.

481
00:35:33,842 --> 00:35:35,969
- But has anyone seen him in London ?
- Actually, yes.

482
00:35:36,053 --> 00:35:39,306
Hmm. But I've had a hardtime
getting actual verification.

483
00:35:39,389 --> 00:35:43,227
A Stephen Hughes said he saw him
at a restaurant there.

484
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:45,229
But I checked it out,
and what happened is...

485
00:35:45,312 --> 00:35:47,648
he mistook a Herbert Ainsworth
for Paul, so--

486
00:35:47,689 --> 00:35:50,984
- Had his apartment been burglarized ?
- No, actually, it hadn't.

487
00:35:51,068 --> 00:35:54,613
Toiletries were missing, a suit was
gone, so was some luggage. That's it.

488
00:35:54,696 --> 00:35:57,115
I mean, no one's dealing with the
homicide squad yet or anything, right ?

489
00:35:57,199 --> 00:35:59,660
No, not yet.
As I said, we're not sure.

490
00:35:59,701 --> 00:36:02,079
Basically, no one's seen
or heard anything.

491
00:36:02,162 --> 00:36:04,957
So typical, isn't it ?
It's just strange.

492
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,543
One day,
someone's walking around,

493
00:36:07,626 --> 00:36:10,128
going to work, alive,
and then--

494
00:36:10,212 --> 00:36:12,631
Nothing.

495
00:36:12,714 --> 00:36:14,675
People just disappear.

496
00:36:14,716 --> 00:36:18,428
The earth just...
opens up and swallows them.

497
00:36:19,763 --> 00:36:22,808
Eerie.
Really eerie.

498
00:36:28,438 --> 00:36:30,607
Listen, you'll have
to excuse me.

499
00:36:30,691 --> 00:36:34,945
I have a lunch meeting with Cliff Huxtable
at Four Seasons in 20 minutes.

500
00:36:35,028 --> 00:36:38,991
The Four Seasons ?
Isn't that a little far uptown ?

501
00:36:39,074 --> 00:36:42,452
I mean, aren't you gonna be late ?
No, there's one down here.

502
00:36:42,536 --> 00:36:44,997
Oh, really ? I didn't know that.
Yeah, it's very good.

503
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:49,209
Listen, if anything else
occurs to you, any information--

504
00:36:49,293 --> 00:36:51,962
Absolutely. I'm 100 percent with you.
Great.

505
00:36:52,045 --> 00:36:55,674
And thanks for your time,
Mr. Bateman.

506
00:36:59,595 --> 00:37:01,555
Bye-bye.
Good-bye.

507
00:38:01,114 --> 00:38:04,284
I haven't seen you around here.
You just haven't been lookin'.

508
00:38:04,326 --> 00:38:08,747
- Would you like to see my apartment ?
- I'm not supposed to.

509
00:38:10,457 --> 00:38:12,376
Do you wanna come
to my apartment or not ?

510
00:38:14,837 --> 00:38:18,966
I'm not supposed to,
but I can make an exception.

511
00:38:20,676 --> 00:38:22,636
Do you take a credit card ?

512
00:38:22,678 --> 00:38:25,305
I'm joking.

513
00:38:25,347 --> 00:38:27,349
Come on. Get in.

514
00:38:37,943 --> 00:38:39,945
I'd like a girl.
Early 20s.

515
00:38:40,028 --> 00:38:43,448
Blonde, who does couples.
Couples.

516
00:38:43,532 --> 00:38:47,911
And I really can't stress
blonde enough. Blonde.

517
00:38:49,538 --> 00:38:52,666
I'm Paul.

518
00:38:52,708 --> 00:38:55,961
My name's Paul Allen.
You got that ?

519
00:38:56,044 --> 00:38:59,965
You're Christie.
You're to respond only to Christie.

520
00:39:00,048 --> 00:39:01,967
Is that clear ?

521
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:14,021
That's a very fine chardonnay
you're drinking.

522
00:39:14,062 --> 00:39:16,857
I want you
to clean your vagina.

523
00:39:25,908 --> 00:39:29,036
No. From behind.
Get on your knees.

524
00:39:29,077 --> 00:39:31,914
You have a very nice body.

525
00:39:42,424 --> 00:39:44,510
Mm-hmm ?

526
00:39:44,593 --> 00:39:47,262
Thank you. Send her up.

527
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:53,060
Christie,
get out and dry off.

528
00:39:53,143 --> 00:39:56,021
Choose a robe--
not the Bijan--

529
00:39:56,104 --> 00:40:00,567
and come and meet me and our guest in
the living room for drinks.

530
00:40:07,407 --> 00:40:09,493
You've arrived.
How lovely.

531
00:40:09,576 --> 00:40:11,495
Let me take your coat.

532
00:40:11,578 --> 00:40:14,331
I'm Paul.
How good of you to come.

533
00:40:19,127 --> 00:40:21,088
Not quite blonde,
are you ?

534
00:40:21,129 --> 00:40:23,090
More dirty blonde.

535
00:40:23,131 --> 00:40:25,634
I'm gonna call you
Sabrina.

536
00:40:25,717 --> 00:40:27,803
I'm Paul Allen.

537
00:40:46,655 --> 00:40:49,116
So.

538
00:40:49,158 --> 00:40:51,118
Don't you wanna know
what I do ?

539
00:40:55,038 --> 00:40:58,083
No.
No, not really.

540
00:40:59,501 --> 00:41:02,838
Well, I work on Wall Street...

541
00:41:02,921 --> 00:41:05,174
for Pierce & Pierce.

542
00:41:05,257 --> 00:41:07,342
Have you heard of it ?

543
00:41:16,435 --> 00:41:19,229
You have a really
nice place here, Paul.

544
00:41:19,313 --> 00:41:21,273
How much
did you pay for it ?

545
00:41:21,356 --> 00:41:23,400
Well, actually,

546
00:41:23,484 --> 00:41:26,320
that's none of your business,
Christie.

547
00:41:26,361 --> 00:41:30,157
But I can assure you,
it certainly wasn't cheap.

548
00:41:30,199 --> 00:41:32,493
No. No smoking.
Not in here.

549
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:37,039
Varda truffle ?

550
00:41:39,541 --> 00:41:41,835
I don't want you to get drunk,

551
00:41:41,919 --> 00:41:45,255
but that's a very fine
chardonnay you're not drinking.

552
00:41:52,679 --> 00:41:55,349
Do you like Phil Collins ?

553
00:41:55,390 --> 00:41:57,643
I've been a big Genesis fan
eversince the release...

554
00:41:57,726 --> 00:42:01,730
of their 1980 album Duke.

555
00:42:01,813 --> 00:42:06,527
Before that, I really didn't
understand any of their work.

556
00:42:06,610 --> 00:42:09,655
It was too artsy,
too intellectual.

557
00:42:09,738 --> 00:42:12,449
It was on Duke where...

558
00:42:12,533 --> 00:42:15,452
Phil Collins' presence
became more apparent.

559
00:42:18,163 --> 00:42:23,043
I think Invisible Touch is the group's
undisputed masterpiece.

560
00:42:25,796 --> 00:42:29,550
It's an epic meditation
on intangibility.

561
00:42:32,469 --> 00:42:35,305
At the same time,
it deepens and enriches...

562
00:42:35,389 --> 00:42:38,767
the meaning of
the preceding three albums.

563
00:42:38,851 --> 00:42:41,854
Christie,
take off the robe.

564
00:42:43,772 --> 00:42:45,983
Listen to the brilliant
ensemble playing...

565
00:42:46,066 --> 00:42:48,694
of Banks, Collins
and Rutherford.

566
00:42:48,777 --> 00:42:53,115
You can practically hear
every nuance of every instrument.

567
00:42:53,198 --> 00:42:55,117
Sabrina, remove your dress.

568
00:42:56,827 --> 00:43:00,289
ln terms of lyrical craftsmanship
and sheer songwriting,

569
00:43:00,372 --> 00:43:03,375
this album hits a new peak
of professionalism.

570
00:43:03,458 --> 00:43:05,878
Sabrina, why don't you,
uh, dance a little.

571
00:43:07,379 --> 00:43:09,882
Take the lyrics to
"Land of Confusion."

572
00:43:09,965 --> 00:43:12,092
In this song,
Phil Collins...

573
00:43:12,134 --> 00:43:16,221
addresses the problems
of abusive political authority.

574
00:43:17,890 --> 00:43:22,019
"In Too Deep" is the most moving pop song
of the 1980s...

575
00:43:22,102 --> 00:43:25,397
about monogamy and commitment.

576
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:28,775
The song is
extremely uplifting.

577
00:43:28,817 --> 00:43:32,237
Their lyrics are
as positive and affirmative...

578
00:43:32,321 --> 00:43:36,575
as, uh, anything
I've heard in rock.

579
00:43:40,204 --> 00:43:42,247
Christie,
get down on your knees...

580
00:43:42,331 --> 00:43:45,375
so Sabrina can see your asshole.

581
00:43:45,459 --> 00:43:48,128
Phil Collins' solo career...

582
00:43:48,212 --> 00:43:51,048
seems to be more commercial,

583
00:43:51,131 --> 00:43:54,259
and therefore more satisfying
in a narrower way,

584
00:43:54,343 --> 00:43:58,889
especially songs like "In the
Air Tonight" and "Against All Odds."

585
00:44:00,849 --> 00:44:02,809
Sabrina, don't just stare at it.
Eat it.

586
00:44:05,187 --> 00:44:07,856
I also think that
Phil Collins works best...

587
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:11,902
within the confines of the group
than as a solo artist.

588
00:44:11,985 --> 00:44:15,364
And I stress the word "artist."

589
00:44:19,368 --> 00:44:21,286
This is "Sussudio."

590
00:44:21,370 --> 00:44:24,373
A great, great song.
A personal favorite.

591
00:44:35,217 --> 00:44:40,889
Look at the camera.

592
00:45:14,631 --> 00:45:18,886
Christie, look at the camera.

593
00:45:34,151 --> 00:45:36,069
Don't touch the watch.

594
00:45:58,258 --> 00:46:00,219
Can we go now ?

595
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:02,221
We're not through yet.

596
00:46:20,239 --> 00:46:23,617
If they have a good personality and they
are not great looking, then who fucking cares ?

597
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:25,619
Let's just say
hypothetically, okay ?

598
00:46:25,702 --> 00:46:27,955
What if they have
a good personality ?

599
00:46:27,996 --> 00:46:31,124
I know.
I know.

600
00:46:31,208 --> 00:46:33,794
There are no girls
with good personalities.

601
00:46:33,877 --> 00:46:36,713
A good personality consists
of a chick with a little hard body...

602
00:46:36,797 --> 00:46:38,715
who will satisfy
all sexual demands...

603
00:46:38,799 --> 00:46:40,717
without being too slutty
about things...

604
00:46:40,801 --> 00:46:42,719
and who will essentially keep
her dumb fucking mouth shut.

605
00:46:42,803 --> 00:46:44,763
The only girls
with good personalities...

606
00:46:44,847 --> 00:46:48,058
who are smart or maybe funny
or halfway intelligent or talented--

607
00:46:48,141 --> 00:46:50,978
though God knows what the fuck that means--
are ugly chicks.

608
00:46:51,061 --> 00:46:53,355
Absolutely. And this is because
they have to make up...

609
00:46:53,438 --> 00:46:55,232
for how fucking
unattractive they are.

610
00:46:55,315 --> 00:46:58,527
- Do you know what Ed Gein said about women ?
- Maitre d' at Canal Bar ?

611
00:46:58,610 --> 00:47:02,573
- No, serial killer, Wisconsin, in the 50s.
- And what did Ed say ?

612
00:47:02,656 --> 00:47:05,742
"When I see a pretty girl walking
down the street, I think two things.

613
00:47:05,826 --> 00:47:08,245
"One part of me wants to
take her out and talk to her,

614
00:47:08,328 --> 00:47:10,789
be real nice and sweet
and treat her right."

615
00:47:10,873 --> 00:47:13,292
- And what did the other part
of him think ?

616
00:47:13,333 --> 00:47:15,961
What her head would look like
on a stick.

617
00:47:20,674 --> 00:47:24,052
Hi, guys.
I wanna get your opinion on something.

618
00:47:25,429 --> 00:47:27,806
It's my business card.

619
00:47:27,848 --> 00:47:31,268
I decided to get
a new one too.

620
00:47:32,811 --> 00:47:34,730
Oh, it's--

621
00:47:34,813 --> 00:47:36,732
Very nice, Luis.

622
00:47:38,358 --> 00:47:40,194
Thank you.

623
00:47:54,041 --> 00:47:56,168
Listen, what about dinner ?

624
00:47:56,210 --> 00:47:59,046
Is that all you ever have to contribute,
Van Patten ? "What about fucking dinner" ?

625
00:47:59,129 --> 00:48:02,174
Cheer up there, Bateman. What's the matter ?
No shiatsu this morning ?

626
00:48:02,216 --> 00:48:05,511
Keep touching me like that, you'll draw
back a stump. Hold on there, little buddy.

627
00:48:05,552 --> 00:48:07,513
Excuse me.

628
00:48:43,924 --> 00:48:47,845
God. Patrick.
Why here ?

629
00:48:47,928 --> 00:48:50,556
I've seen you
looking at me.

630
00:48:50,597 --> 00:48:53,851
I've noticed your...

631
00:48:53,934 --> 00:48:56,562
hot body.

632
00:48:56,603 --> 00:48:58,647
Don't be shy.

633
00:48:58,730 --> 00:49:00,899
You can't imagine how long
I've wanted this--

634
00:49:00,941 --> 00:49:03,610
ever since that Christmas party
at Arizona 206.

635
00:49:03,694 --> 00:49:06,947
You know, the one you were wearing
that red-striped paisley Armani tie.

636
00:49:10,659 --> 00:49:14,413
I want you.
I want you too.

637
00:49:14,454 --> 00:49:16,415
Patrick.
What is it ?

638
00:49:16,456 --> 00:49:19,585
Where are you going ?

639
00:49:19,626 --> 00:49:22,462
I've gotta return
some video tapes.

640
00:49:29,970 --> 00:49:33,015
Patrick !

641
00:49:56,288 --> 00:49:58,499
Okay, London the--

642
00:49:58,582 --> 00:50:01,418
London, there's, um, a reservation--
Any Paul Allen ?

643
00:50:01,502 --> 00:50:03,879
No. A reservation, but--
Kimball !

644
00:50:03,962 --> 00:50:06,089
I've been wanting to talk with you.
Come into my office.

645
00:50:06,173 --> 00:50:08,091
Jean, greatjacket.
Matsuta ?

646
00:50:08,175 --> 00:50:12,137
Do you remember where you were the night
of Paul's disappearance,

647
00:50:12,179 --> 00:50:14,139
which was on
the 20th of December ?

648
00:50:14,181 --> 00:50:16,225
God.

649
00:50:16,308 --> 00:50:19,394
I guess I was probably
returning video tapes.

650
00:50:22,856 --> 00:50:24,817
I had a date
with a girl named Veronica.

651
00:50:24,858 --> 00:50:27,361
That's not what I've got.
What ?

652
00:50:27,444 --> 00:50:29,822
That's not the information
I've received.

653
00:50:29,863 --> 00:50:32,199
Well, I-- Wait.

654
00:50:32,241 --> 00:50:35,244
- What information have you received ?
- Let me see.

655
00:50:35,327 --> 00:50:38,163
Well--

656
00:50:38,205 --> 00:50:40,165
You were with--
Well, I could be wrong.

657
00:50:40,207 --> 00:50:43,836
When was the last time
you were with Paul Allen ?

658
00:50:43,919 --> 00:50:46,171
We'd gone to a new musical...

659
00:50:46,213 --> 00:50:49,800
called
Oh, Africa, Brave Africa.

660
00:50:49,883 --> 00:50:52,970
It was a laugh riot.
That was about it.

661
00:50:53,053 --> 00:50:56,431
I think we had dinner at Orso's. No, Peto--
No, Orso's.

662
00:50:56,515 --> 00:50:59,768
I hope I've been informative.
Long day, a bit scattered.

663
00:50:59,852 --> 00:51:01,812
I'm a little spent now too.

664
00:51:01,895 --> 00:51:05,023
But how about lunch
in a week or so...

665
00:51:05,065 --> 00:51:07,359
when I've sorted out
all this information ?

666
00:51:07,401 --> 00:51:09,361
Great.
Yes, I'd like that.

667
00:51:09,403 --> 00:51:12,656
And if you could try and pin down
where you were...

668
00:51:12,739 --> 00:51:16,368
the night of Paul Allen's disappearance,
it would make my job a lot easier.

669
00:51:16,410 --> 00:51:18,704
Absolutely.
I'm with you on that one.

670
00:51:22,332 --> 00:51:24,251
Huey Lewis and the News.

671
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:30,215
Great stuff. I just bought it on my way here.
You heard it ?

672
00:51:31,550 --> 00:51:35,304
Never. I mean,
I don't really like singers.

673
00:51:35,387 --> 00:51:38,891
Not a big music fan, huh ?
No, I like music.

674
00:51:38,932 --> 00:51:43,645
Just they're--
Huey's too black sounding for me.

675
00:51:43,729 --> 00:51:45,772
To each his own.

676
00:51:47,858 --> 00:51:50,068
So, lunch next week ?

677
00:51:50,110 --> 00:51:52,070
I'll be there.

678
00:52:01,121 --> 00:52:03,165
Oh !

679
00:52:03,248 --> 00:52:05,250
Oh !

680
00:52:27,648 --> 00:52:31,318
Will you call me before Easter ?
Maybe.

681
00:52:34,988 --> 00:52:36,949
What are you doing tonight ?

682
00:52:36,990 --> 00:52:39,827
Dinner at, uh, River Cafe.

683
00:52:39,868 --> 00:52:43,205
Au Bar afterwards, maybe.
That's nice.

684
00:52:45,123 --> 00:52:47,960
I never knew you smoked.

685
00:52:48,001 --> 00:52:49,962
You never noticed.

686
00:52:53,215 --> 00:52:55,509
Listen, Patrick.

687
00:52:55,634 --> 00:52:57,427
Can we talk ?

688
00:53:03,475 --> 00:53:05,853
You look... marvelous.

689
00:53:07,855 --> 00:53:09,815
There's nothing to say.

690
00:53:09,857 --> 00:53:13,443
You're gonna marry Luis.
Isn't that special ?

691
00:53:14,987 --> 00:53:16,905
Patrick ?

692
00:53:21,410 --> 00:53:23,370
Yes, Courtney ?

693
00:53:25,998 --> 00:53:28,709
If I don't see you
before Easter,

694
00:53:28,792 --> 00:53:30,878
have a nice one, okay ?

695
00:53:35,883 --> 00:53:37,843
You too.

696
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:46,143
Patrick ?

697
00:53:46,226 --> 00:53:48,145
Yeah ?

698
00:53:49,396 --> 00:53:54,067
Nothing.

699
00:54:20,135 --> 00:54:22,095
There is this theory now--
Listen to me.

700
00:54:22,137 --> 00:54:24,097
There is this theory now that if
you can catch the AlDS virus...

701
00:54:24,181 --> 00:54:27,601
by having sex with someone who's infected,
then you can catch anything.

702
00:54:27,643 --> 00:54:30,979
Alzheimer's, muscular dystrophy,
hemophilia,

703
00:54:31,063 --> 00:54:33,774
leukemia, diabetes,
dyslexia.

704
00:54:33,857 --> 00:54:36,568
I'm not sure, but I don't think
dyslexia is a virus.

705
00:54:36,652 --> 00:54:39,029
But who knows ?
They don't know that.

706
00:54:39,112 --> 00:54:41,031
Prove it.

707
00:54:52,626 --> 00:54:54,545
Oh, God.
What ?

708
00:54:54,628 --> 00:54:58,048
It's a fucking milligram of sweetener.
I wanna get high off this,

709
00:54:58,131 --> 00:55:00,425
not sprinkle it on my fucking oatmeal.
It's definitely weak,

710
00:55:00,467 --> 00:55:02,636
but I have a feeling if we do
enough of it, we'll be okay.

711
00:55:02,719 --> 00:55:06,181
Can you keep it down ?
I'm trying to do drugs.

712
00:55:06,265 --> 00:55:08,600
Fuck you ! Calm down.
Let's do it anyway.

713
00:55:08,642 --> 00:55:10,644
That's right.

714
00:55:10,727 --> 00:55:12,688
That is if the faggot in the next
stall thinks it's okay !

715
00:55:12,771 --> 00:55:14,690
Fuck you !
Hey, fuck you !

716
00:55:17,151 --> 00:55:19,528
Sorry, dude. Steroids.

717
00:55:19,611 --> 00:55:21,989
Okay, let's do it.

718
00:55:41,884 --> 00:55:44,678
Where did Craig go ?

719
00:55:44,761 --> 00:55:48,182
Well, Gorbachev is downstairs.
McDermott went to sign a peace treaty...

720
00:55:48,265 --> 00:55:50,184
between the United States
and Russia.

721
00:55:50,267 --> 00:55:53,020
He's the one behind Glasnost.

722
00:55:53,103 --> 00:55:56,565
- He said he was in mergers and acquisitions.
- You're not confused, are you ?

723
00:55:56,648 --> 00:55:58,692
No, not really.

724
00:55:58,775 --> 00:56:01,612
Gorbachev is not downstairs.
- Karen's right.

725
00:56:01,695 --> 00:56:04,364
Gorbachev's not downstairs.
He's at Tunnel.

726
00:56:04,448 --> 00:56:06,366
Ask me a question.

727
00:56:07,743 --> 00:56:09,703
So, what do you do ?

728
00:56:09,745 --> 00:56:13,207
I'm into, uh, well, murders
and executions, mostly.

729
00:56:13,290 --> 00:56:17,127
- Do you like it ?
- Well, it depends. Why ?

730
00:56:17,211 --> 00:56:22,466
Well, most guys I know who work in mergers
and acquisitions really don't like it.

731
00:56:24,885 --> 00:56:28,472
So, where do you work out ?

732
00:56:31,183 --> 00:56:33,685
You think I'm dumb,
don't you ?

733
00:56:33,727 --> 00:56:36,855
What ? You think I'm dumb.
You think all models are dumb.

734
00:56:36,939 --> 00:56:39,775
No.
I really don't.

735
00:56:39,858 --> 00:56:42,611
That's okay.
I don't mind.

736
00:56:42,694 --> 00:56:44,613
There's something sweet
about you.

737
00:57:11,098 --> 00:57:13,058
Doin' the crossword ?

738
00:57:18,105 --> 00:57:20,357
You need any help ?

739
00:57:30,450 --> 00:57:33,245
-Jean ?
- Yes, Patrick ?

740
00:57:33,287 --> 00:57:36,623
Would you like to accompany me
to dinner ?

741
00:57:36,665 --> 00:57:39,585
That is,
if you're not doing anything.

742
00:57:39,626 --> 00:57:42,421
Um, no. No,
I don't have any plans.

743
00:57:44,673 --> 00:57:46,633
Well,

744
00:57:48,802 --> 00:57:50,888
isn't this a coincidence ?

745
00:57:50,971 --> 00:57:53,265
Listen, where should we go ?
Anywhere you want.

746
00:57:53,307 --> 00:57:56,310
Let's not think about what I want.
How about anywhere you want ?

747
00:57:58,270 --> 00:58:00,898
I don't know, Patrick.
I can't make this decision.

748
00:58:00,981 --> 00:58:04,693
Come on.
Where do you wanna go ?

749
00:58:04,776 --> 00:58:09,615
Anywhere you want, just say it.
I can get us in anywhere.

750
00:58:09,656 --> 00:58:11,617
What about...

751
00:58:19,791 --> 00:58:21,710
Dorsia ?

752
00:58:28,133 --> 00:58:30,469
So,

753
00:58:30,511 --> 00:58:33,055
Dorsia is where
Jean wants to go.

754
00:58:33,138 --> 00:58:36,767
Well, I don't know.
We'll go wherever you wanna go.

755
00:58:36,850 --> 00:58:38,769
Dorsia is fine.

756
00:58:45,150 --> 00:58:47,069
Dorsia. Yes ?

757
00:58:47,152 --> 00:58:51,323
Yeah, can you take two tonight at,
oh, let's say 9:00 ? We're totally booked.

758
00:58:51,365 --> 00:58:53,325
Really ? That's great.

759
00:58:53,367 --> 00:58:56,912
No, I said we are totally booked.
Two at 9:00 ? Perfect.

760
00:58:56,995 --> 00:58:58,997
See ya then.

761
00:59:01,708 --> 00:59:04,044
Yeah ?

762
00:59:04,086 --> 00:59:07,548
You're... dressed okay.

763
00:59:07,589 --> 00:59:11,844
- You didn't give a name.
- They know me.

764
00:59:13,011 --> 00:59:16,640
Why don't you meet me
at my place at 7:00...

765
00:59:16,723 --> 00:59:19,101
for drinks.

766
00:59:19,184 --> 00:59:21,103
And Jean,

767
00:59:21,186 --> 00:59:23,188
you'll wanna change
before we go out.

768
00:59:31,613 --> 00:59:33,699
Patrick, it's so elegant.

769
00:59:33,740 --> 00:59:35,784
What a wonderful view.

770
00:59:35,868 --> 00:59:38,287
Jean,

771
00:59:38,370 --> 00:59:40,289
sorbet ?

772
00:59:41,915 --> 00:59:44,209
Thanks, Patrick.
I'd love some.

773
00:59:50,299 --> 00:59:54,052
Do you want a bite ?
I'm on a diet. But thank you.

774
00:59:54,136 --> 00:59:57,598
You don't need to lose any weight.
You're kidding, right ?

775
00:59:57,681 --> 00:59:59,725
You look great.
Very fit.

776
01:00:01,018 --> 01:00:04,146
You can always be thinner,
look better.

777
01:00:04,229 --> 01:00:08,692
Well, maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner.
I don't wanna ruin your will power.

778
01:00:08,775 --> 01:00:11,528
No, it's all right.

779
01:00:11,612 --> 01:00:15,032
I'm not very good
at controlling it anyway.

780
01:00:17,659 --> 01:00:19,620
So listen.

781
01:00:19,661 --> 01:00:22,748
What do you really
wanna do with your life ?

782
01:00:22,831 --> 01:00:25,083
Just briefly, summarize.

783
01:00:25,125 --> 01:00:28,003
And don't tell me you enjoy working
with children, okay ?

784
01:00:28,086 --> 01:00:32,466
Well, I'd like to travel
and maybe go back to school,

785
01:00:32,508 --> 01:00:35,469
but I don't really know.

786
01:00:35,552 --> 01:00:39,932
I'm at a point in my life where
there seems to be so many possibilities,

787
01:00:40,057 --> 01:00:43,519
but I'm-- I don't know--
I'm just so unsure.

788
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:49,691
Do you have a boyfriend ?

789
01:00:49,775 --> 01:00:53,529
No, not really.
Interesting.

790
01:00:53,570 --> 01:00:57,241
Are you seeing anyone ?
I mean, seriously ?

791
01:00:57,324 --> 01:00:59,660
Maybe.

792
01:00:59,743 --> 01:01:02,871
I don't know.
Not really.

793
01:01:05,999 --> 01:01:07,918
Jean,

794
01:01:08,001 --> 01:01:10,671
do you feel... fulfilled ?

795
01:01:10,754 --> 01:01:13,382
I mean, in your life ?

796
01:01:13,423 --> 01:01:16,426
I guess I do. For a long time
I was too focused on my work.

797
01:01:16,468 --> 01:01:21,598
But now I've really begun to think
about changing myself, you know,

798
01:01:21,682 --> 01:01:24,184
developing and growing.

799
01:01:24,268 --> 01:01:27,479
Growing.
I'm glad you said that.

800
01:01:29,773 --> 01:01:34,153
Did you know that, uh,
Ted Bundy's first dog,

801
01:01:34,236 --> 01:01:37,406
a collie,
was named Lassie ?

802
01:01:37,447 --> 01:01:40,909
Had you heard this ?
Who's Ted Bundy ?

803
01:01:42,786 --> 01:01:45,205
Forget it.

804
01:01:45,289 --> 01:01:47,916
What's that ?

805
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:52,963
Duct tape. I need it for, uh,
taping something.

806
01:01:58,218 --> 01:02:00,721
Patrick,

807
01:02:00,804 --> 01:02:03,599
have you ever wanted to...
make someone happy ?

808
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:06,059
What ? No !
Put it in the carton.

809
01:02:08,479 --> 01:02:10,772
Sorry.

810
01:02:10,814 --> 01:02:12,566
Jean ?

811
01:02:14,526 --> 01:02:19,114
What ?
Uh, make someone happy ?

812
01:02:20,449 --> 01:02:22,826
Have you ever wanted to ?

813
01:02:25,162 --> 01:02:27,664
I'm looking for, uh,

814
01:02:31,502 --> 01:02:34,755
I guess you could say I just wanna have
a meaningful relationship...

815
01:02:34,838 --> 01:02:38,675
with someone special.
Hmm.

816
01:02:46,308 --> 01:02:49,686
Patrick ? Patrick ?
I know you're there.

817
01:02:49,770 --> 01:02:51,980
Pick up the phone,
you badboy.

818
01:02:52,022 --> 01:02:56,151
What are you up to tonight ?
It's me. Don't try to hide.

819
01:02:56,193 --> 01:03:00,405
I hope you're not with some little number
you picked up because you're my Mr. Bateman.

820
01:03:00,489 --> 01:03:03,116
My boy next door.

821
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:05,619
Anyway, you never called me
and you said you would,

822
01:03:05,702 --> 01:03:08,205
and I'll leave a message for Jean
about this, too, to remind you,

823
01:03:08,288 --> 01:03:10,666
but we're having dinner
with Melania and Taylor.

824
01:03:10,707 --> 01:03:13,001
You know Me lania.
She went to Sweet Briar.

825
01:03:13,085 --> 01:03:15,337
And we're meeting
at the Cornell Club,

826
01:03:15,379 --> 01:03:17,381
so I'll call you
tomorrowmorning, honey.

827
01:03:17,464 --> 01:03:19,842
Oops. Sorry.
I know you hate that.

828
01:03:19,925 --> 01:03:25,389
Bye, Patrick.
Bye, Mr. Big Time C.E.O. Bye-bye.

829
01:03:28,725 --> 01:03:31,687
Was that Evelyn ?

830
01:03:34,565 --> 01:03:36,984
Are you still seeing her?

831
01:03:41,113 --> 01:03:44,366
I'm sorry.
I have no right to ask that.

832
01:03:49,246 --> 01:03:51,707
Do you want me to go ?

833
01:03:51,790 --> 01:03:53,709
Yeah.

834
01:03:55,752 --> 01:03:58,505
I don't think
I can control myself.

835
01:04:00,716 --> 01:04:05,512
I know. I should go. I know I have
a tendency to get involved with unavailable men.

836
01:04:08,056 --> 01:04:09,975
I mean,

837
01:04:11,268 --> 01:04:13,979
do you want me to go ?

838
01:04:14,062 --> 01:04:17,024
I think if you stay,

839
01:04:17,107 --> 01:04:19,776
something bad will happen.

840
01:04:21,111 --> 01:04:23,030
I think I might hurt you.

841
01:04:24,490 --> 01:04:26,867
You don't wanna get hurt,
do you ?

842
01:04:26,950 --> 01:04:29,244
No. No, I guess not.

843
01:04:30,579 --> 01:04:33,248
I don't wanna get bruised.

844
01:04:35,125 --> 01:04:38,128
You're right.
I should go.

845
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:48,722
Oh. Don't forget you have a lunch date
tomorrow with Donald Kimball at Smith and Wolenski's.

846
01:04:49,807 --> 01:04:52,142
Thanks.

847
01:04:52,226 --> 01:04:54,520
It slipped my mind completely.

848
01:05:13,580 --> 01:05:17,584
So, the night
he disappeared--

849
01:05:17,668 --> 01:05:20,420
any new thoughts
about what you did ?

850
01:05:22,381 --> 01:05:25,843
Not sure.
Um, I had a shower...

851
01:05:25,926 --> 01:05:27,845
and some sorbet ?

852
01:05:27,928 --> 01:05:29,972
I think you're getting
your dates mixed up.

853
01:05:30,055 --> 01:05:31,974
But how ?

854
01:05:32,057 --> 01:05:35,102
Where do you place...
Paul that night ?

855
01:05:35,185 --> 01:05:38,689
According to his date book, and
this was verified by his secretary,

856
01:05:38,772 --> 01:05:41,692
he had dinner
with Marcus Halberstram.

857
01:05:41,775 --> 01:05:43,986
And ?
I questioned him.

858
01:05:44,069 --> 01:05:48,323
- Marcus ? - Yes, and he denies it, though,
at first, he couldn't be sure.

859
01:05:48,365 --> 01:05:51,326
But he denied it.
Yes.

860
01:05:52,536 --> 01:05:54,621
Well, does Marcus
have an alibi ?

861
01:05:54,705 --> 01:05:58,167
Yes.
He does ? You'resure ?

862
01:05:58,250 --> 01:06:00,169
I checked it out.
It's clean.

863
01:06:04,298 --> 01:06:07,718
Now, where were you ?

864
01:06:07,801 --> 01:06:09,887
Where was Marcus ?

865
01:06:09,970 --> 01:06:12,139
He wasn't with Paul Allen.

866
01:06:12,222 --> 01:06:14,349
Who was he with ?
He was...

867
01:06:14,433 --> 01:06:16,894
at Atlantis... with...

868
01:06:16,977 --> 01:06:21,023
Craig McDermott, Frederick Dibble,
Harry Newman, George Butner...

869
01:06:21,106 --> 01:06:23,650
and... you.

870
01:06:27,863 --> 01:06:29,781
Oh, right, yeah.
Of course.

871
01:06:29,865 --> 01:06:34,036
We had wanted
Paul Allen to come,

872
01:06:34,077 --> 01:06:36,288
but he had made plans.

873
01:06:36,371 --> 01:06:40,334
And I guess I had dinner with
Victoria the following night.

874
01:06:40,417 --> 01:06:42,794
Personally, I think the guy
went a little nutso.

875
01:06:42,878 --> 01:06:47,758
Split town for a while. Maybe he did go
to London, sightseeing, drinking, whatever.

876
01:06:47,841 --> 01:06:52,054
Anyway, I'm pretty sure he'll turn
up sooner or later. I mean, to think...

877
01:06:52,095 --> 01:06:57,392
that one of his friends killed him for no
reason whatsoever would be too ridiculous.

878
01:06:57,434 --> 01:06:59,728
Isn't that right, Patrick ?

879
01:07:20,582 --> 01:07:23,043
Christie. Christie.

880
01:07:23,126 --> 01:07:26,880
I'm not so sure about this.
I had to go to Emergency after last time.

881
01:07:26,964 --> 01:07:29,716
This won't be anything
like last time. I promise.

882
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:32,594
I don't think so.

883
01:07:32,636 --> 01:07:35,931
Just come in the limo
and talk to me for a minute.

884
01:07:35,973 --> 01:07:37,933
The driver's here.
You'll be safe.

885
01:07:56,785 --> 01:07:59,163
Nothing like last time.
Promise.

886
01:07:59,246 --> 01:08:01,165
All right.

887
01:08:01,248 --> 01:08:04,543
So, you're looking great.
How have you been ?

888
01:08:04,626 --> 01:08:08,463
Well, I actually might need surgery
after last time. Really ?

889
01:08:08,505 --> 01:08:12,634
My friend told me I should maybe
even get a lawyer.

890
01:08:12,676 --> 01:08:15,387
Lawyers are so complicated.

891
01:08:15,470 --> 01:08:18,015
Don't do that.

892
01:08:18,098 --> 01:08:20,017
Here's a check.

893
01:09:07,773 --> 01:09:11,610
Uh-uh. Half now,
half later.

894
01:09:16,865 --> 01:09:20,369
Okay, your name is Christie.

895
01:09:20,452 --> 01:09:23,080
We're meeting a friend
of mine, Elizabeth.

896
01:09:23,163 --> 01:09:27,584
She'll bejoining us
in my new apartment shortly.

897
01:09:27,668 --> 01:09:31,088
You'll like her.
She's a very nice girl.

898
01:09:37,177 --> 01:09:40,806
You look really familiar.
Did you go to Dalton ?

899
01:09:43,225 --> 01:09:45,936
I think I met you at Surf Bar, didn't I ?
With Spicey ?

900
01:09:46,019 --> 01:09:49,231
Well, maybe not with Spicey, but
definitely at SurfBar. You know, SurfBar.

901
01:09:49,273 --> 01:09:51,441
Anyway, Surf Bar sucks now.
It's terrible.

902
01:09:51,525 --> 01:09:56,697
Went to a birthday party there
for Malcolm Forbes. Oh, my God, please.

903
01:09:56,780 --> 01:09:59,324
This is nicer
than your other apartment.

904
01:10:01,493 --> 01:10:03,620
Oh, it's not
that nice.

905
01:10:08,292 --> 01:10:11,962
Where did you two meet ?
Oh, God. We met at...

906
01:10:12,045 --> 01:10:16,466
oh, God, at the Kentucky Derby
in '85, or '86.

907
01:10:16,508 --> 01:10:19,845
You were hanging out with that
bimbo Allison Poole. Hot number.

908
01:10:19,928 --> 01:10:22,181
What do you mean ?
She was a hot number.

909
01:10:22,264 --> 01:10:26,852
If you had a platinum card, she'd give you
a blowjob. This girl worked in a tanning salon.

910
01:10:26,935 --> 01:10:29,480
What do you do ?

911
01:10:29,563 --> 01:10:33,484
She's my... cousin.

912
01:10:33,567 --> 01:10:37,488
Uh-huh.
She's from... France.

913
01:10:37,529 --> 01:10:40,908
Where's your phone ?
I've gotta call Harley.

914
01:10:44,369 --> 01:10:48,081
Where do you summer,
South Hampton ?

915
01:10:49,249 --> 01:10:52,419
- No.
- Oh, God, it's his machine.

916
01:10:52,503 --> 01:10:56,507
It's 3:00 in the morning. He's a goddamn
drug dealer. These are his peak hours.

917
01:10:56,590 --> 01:10:58,675
Don't tell him you're here.
Why would I ?

918
01:10:58,759 --> 01:11:00,677
This tastes weird.

919
01:11:00,761 --> 01:11:05,015
Harley, it's me. I need your services.
Translate that howeveryou want.

920
01:11:05,098 --> 01:11:08,852
- I'm at--
- Paul Allen's.

921
01:11:08,936 --> 01:11:11,230
Who ?
Paul Allen's.

922
01:11:11,313 --> 01:11:15,234
I want the number, idiot. Anyway, I'm at
Paul Norman's and I'll try you again later.

923
01:11:15,317 --> 01:11:19,071
And if I don't see you at Canal Bar tomorrow
night I'm gonna sic my hairdresser on you.

924
01:11:19,154 --> 01:11:21,073
Did you know that guy
who disappeared ?

925
01:11:21,156 --> 01:11:24,034
Didn't he work at Pierce & Pierce ?
Was he a friend of yours ?

926
01:11:24,117 --> 01:11:26,036
No.

927
01:11:26,119 --> 01:11:28,997
Do you have any coke ?
Or Halcyon ?

928
01:11:29,039 --> 01:11:32,084
I would take a Halcyon.
Listen.

929
01:11:33,794 --> 01:11:35,921
I would just like to see...

930
01:11:36,004 --> 01:11:38,507
the two of you...
get it on.

931
01:11:38,549 --> 01:11:41,760
What's wrong with that ?

932
01:11:41,844 --> 01:11:44,096
It's totally disease free.

933
01:11:45,931 --> 01:11:49,017
Patrick, you're a lunatic.
Come on.

934
01:11:49,059 --> 01:11:51,395
Don't you find Christie
attractive ?

935
01:11:51,436 --> 01:11:55,232
Let's not get lewd. I'm in no mood
for a lewd conversation.

936
01:11:55,274 --> 01:11:57,609
Come on.

937
01:11:57,693 --> 01:12:01,113
I think it'd be a turn-on.
Does he do this all the time ?

938
01:12:03,907 --> 01:12:06,577
Christie,
you're not drinking your wine.

939
01:12:08,078 --> 01:12:10,497
Are you telling me you've never
gotten it on with a girl?

940
01:12:10,581 --> 01:12:13,709
No. I'm not a lesbian.

941
01:12:13,750 --> 01:12:16,628
Why would you think
I would be into that ?

942
01:12:16,712 --> 01:12:18,881
Well, you went to
Sarah Lawrence for one thing.

943
01:12:18,964 --> 01:12:23,552
Those are Sarah Lawrence guys, Patrick.
You're making me feel weird.

944
01:12:28,140 --> 01:12:30,100
Did you know...

945
01:12:30,184 --> 01:12:33,645
that Whitney Houston's
debut LP...

946
01:12:33,729 --> 01:12:36,732
called simply
Whitney Houston...

947
01:12:36,773 --> 01:12:39,610
had four number-one
singles on it ?

948
01:12:41,069 --> 01:12:43,197
Did you know that,
Christie ?

949
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:46,700
You actually listen
to Whitney Houston ?

950
01:12:46,783 --> 01:12:49,578
You own
a Whitney Houston CD ?

951
01:12:50,913 --> 01:12:54,166
More than one ?

952
01:12:54,249 --> 01:12:57,711
It's hard to choose a favorite among
so many great tracks.

953
01:12:59,796 --> 01:13:04,593
But the "Greatest Love Of All"
is one of the best, most powerful songs...

954
01:13:04,635 --> 01:13:06,804
ever written...

955
01:13:06,887 --> 01:13:08,806
about self-preservation...

956
01:13:08,889 --> 01:13:11,099
and dignity.

957
01:13:11,141 --> 01:13:14,770
It's universal message
crosses all boundaries...

958
01:13:14,812 --> 01:13:17,022
and instills one...

959
01:13:17,105 --> 01:13:20,734
with the hope
that it's not too late...

960
01:13:20,818 --> 01:13:23,153
to better ourselves.

961
01:13:23,195 --> 01:13:26,573
Since, Elizabeth,

962
01:13:26,657 --> 01:13:31,620
it's impossible in this world we
live in to empathize with others,

963
01:13:31,662 --> 01:13:35,249
we can always empathize
with ourselves.

964
01:13:35,332 --> 01:13:39,628
It's an important message.
Crucial, really.

965
01:13:42,506 --> 01:13:45,425
And it's beautifully stated
on the album.

966
01:14:55,329 --> 01:14:57,748
- Not the face !

967
01:14:57,831 --> 01:15:01,877
You bitch, not the fucking face,
you piece of bitch trash !

968
01:16:30,507 --> 01:16:33,177
I want a firm commitment.

969
01:16:33,260 --> 01:16:36,889
I think, um, Evelyn,
that, uh, we've lost touch.

970
01:16:36,972 --> 01:16:38,891
Why ? What's wrong ?

971
01:16:42,352 --> 01:16:44,396
My need to engage
in homicidal behavior...

972
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:47,274
on a massive scale
cannot be corrected,

973
01:16:47,357 --> 01:16:50,360
but I have no other way
to fulfill my needs.

974
01:16:51,862 --> 01:16:54,781
We need to talk.
Talk about what, Patrick ?

975
01:16:54,865 --> 01:16:56,867
It's over, Evelyn.

976
01:16:56,950 --> 01:16:59,453
It's all over.

977
01:16:59,536 --> 01:17:02,831
Touchy, touchy.
I'm sorry I brought up the wedding.

978
01:17:02,873 --> 01:17:06,376
Let's just avoid the issue,
all right ? Now, are we having coffee ?

979
01:17:06,460 --> 01:17:11,298
I'm fucking serious. It's fucking over, us.
This is no joke.

980
01:17:11,381 --> 01:17:14,259
Uh, I don't think we should
see each other anymore.

981
01:17:14,343 --> 01:17:19,598
But your friends are my friends
and my friends are your friends.

982
01:17:19,681 --> 01:17:22,976
I really don't think it would work.
You have a little something--

983
01:17:23,060 --> 01:17:28,398
I know that your friends are my friends,
and, uh-- and I've thought about that.

984
01:17:28,482 --> 01:17:31,527
You can have 'em.

985
01:17:31,610 --> 01:17:35,072
You're really serious,
aren't you ? Yes, lam.

986
01:17:38,242 --> 01:17:42,412
- What about the past ? Our past ?
- We never really shared one.

987
01:17:42,496 --> 01:17:44,540
You're inhuman.
No.

988
01:17:44,623 --> 01:17:47,751
I'm in touch with humanity.

989
01:17:47,835 --> 01:17:52,256
Evelyn, I'm, uh, sorry.
I just, uh--

990
01:17:52,339 --> 01:17:54,383
You're not terribly
important to me.

991
01:17:54,466 --> 01:17:57,136
Oh, no !

992
01:17:57,219 --> 01:17:59,471
No. No, Patrick.

993
01:17:59,555 --> 01:18:04,101
I know my behavior can be...
erratic sometimes.

994
01:18:05,477 --> 01:18:08,564
What do you want me to do ?
What is it that you want ?

995
01:18:08,647 --> 01:18:11,984
If you really wanna do something for me,
then stop making this scene right now.

996
01:18:12,067 --> 01:18:14,987
Oh, God, I can't believe this.

997
01:18:15,070 --> 01:18:17,573
I'm leaving. I've assessed the
situation, and I'm going.

998
01:18:17,614 --> 01:18:20,951
Where are you going ?
I'm just leaving.

999
01:18:21,034 --> 01:18:23,162
But where ?

1000
01:18:24,246 --> 01:18:26,498
I have to return
some videotapes.

1001
01:18:57,321 --> 01:18:59,156
Here, kitty, kitty.

1002
01:19:15,464 --> 01:19:17,591
Oh, my God.
What are you doing ?

1003
01:19:17,674 --> 01:19:19,676
Stop that.

1004
01:20:01,426 --> 01:20:03,846
Drop the weapon !
Drop it now !

1005
01:20:03,887 --> 01:20:05,931
Get on the ground!
Put your--

1006
01:20:49,057 --> 01:20:51,477
Burning the midnight oil,
Mr. Smith ?

1007
01:20:51,560 --> 01:20:53,937
Hey, now don't forget
to sign in.

1008
01:22:22,985 --> 01:22:26,155
Howard, it's Bateman.
Patrick Bateman.

1009
01:22:26,238 --> 01:22:29,241
You're my lawyer, so I think you should
know I've killed a lot of people.

1010
01:22:29,324 --> 01:22:32,119
Some escort girls
in an apartment uptown,

1011
01:22:32,202 --> 01:22:35,414
uh, some homeless people,
maybe five or ten,

1012
01:22:35,497 --> 01:22:37,875
an N.Y.U. girl I met
in Central Park.

1013
01:22:37,958 --> 01:22:40,210
I left her at a parking lot
behind some doughnut shop.

1014
01:22:40,294 --> 01:22:43,463
I killed Bethany, my old girlfriend,
with a nail gun.

1015
01:22:43,547 --> 01:22:48,010
And-And-And then some man,
s-s-some old faggot with a dog.

1016
01:22:48,051 --> 01:22:50,262
Last week, I, uh--

1017
01:22:50,345 --> 01:22:53,849
I killed another girl
with a chain saw.

1018
01:22:56,643 --> 01:22:59,897
I had to.
She almost got away.

1019
01:22:59,980 --> 01:23:01,899
And--

1020
01:23:01,982 --> 01:23:07,112
Someone else there. I can't remember,
maybe a model-- She's dead too.

1021
01:23:07,196 --> 01:23:09,740
And, uh, Paul Allen.

1022
01:23:09,823 --> 01:23:13,660
I killed Paul Allen
with an ax in the face.

1023
01:23:13,744 --> 01:23:18,165
His body is dissolving
in a bathtub in Hell's Kitchen.

1024
01:23:18,248 --> 01:23:22,878
I don't wanna leave anything out here.
I guess I've killed maybe... 20 people.

1025
01:23:22,920 --> 01:23:26,048
Maybe 40 !

1026
01:23:26,089 --> 01:23:29,468
I have tapes of a lot of it.

1027
01:23:29,551 --> 01:23:32,179
Some of the girls
have seen the tapes.

1028
01:23:32,262 --> 01:23:34,932
I even, um,

1029
01:23:41,980 --> 01:23:44,483
I ate some
of their brains...

1030
01:23:44,566 --> 01:23:48,320
and I tried to
cook a little.

1031
01:23:50,697 --> 01:23:53,909
Tonight, I, uh--

1032
01:23:53,992 --> 01:23:57,955
I just had to kill
a lot of people !

1033
01:23:57,996 --> 01:24:00,165
And, um,

1034
01:24:03,210 --> 01:24:08,340
I'm not sure I'm gonna
get away with it... this time.

1035
01:24:11,176 --> 01:24:14,221
So, uh-- I mean,

1036
01:24:14,304 --> 01:24:17,766
I guess...

1037
01:24:17,808 --> 01:24:20,477
I'm a pretty, uh--

1038
01:24:21,562 --> 01:24:24,565
I mean, I guess
I'm a pretty sick guy.

1039
01:24:24,648 --> 01:24:27,234
So,

1040
01:24:28,819 --> 01:24:31,738
if you get back tomorrow,

1041
01:24:31,822 --> 01:24:34,074
I may show up at Harry's Bar.

1042
01:24:34,158 --> 01:24:37,244
So, you know,

1043
01:24:37,327 --> 01:24:39,538
keep your eyes open.

1044
01:24:39,621 --> 01:24:42,708
Okay.

1045
01:24:46,753 --> 01:24:48,672
Oh !

1046
01:26:58,927 --> 01:27:01,263
Are you my 2:00 ?

1047
01:27:01,346 --> 01:27:05,267
No.
Can I help you ?

1048
01:27:06,435 --> 01:27:10,522
I'm looking for...
Paul Allen's place.

1049
01:27:11,648 --> 01:27:15,444
Doesn't he... live here ?
No, he doesn't.

1050
01:27:15,527 --> 01:27:18,447
You sure ?

1051
01:27:18,530 --> 01:27:20,866
You saw the ad
in the Times ?

1052
01:27:20,949 --> 01:27:23,911
No. Yeah.
I mean, yeah.

1053
01:27:23,952 --> 01:27:27,539
ln the Times. There was no ad
in the Times.

1054
01:27:28,790 --> 01:27:31,084
I think you should
go now.

1055
01:27:31,126 --> 01:27:33,086
But I think--

1056
01:27:34,713 --> 01:27:36,924
I wanna know
what happened here.

1057
01:27:37,007 --> 01:27:40,260
Don't make any trouble,
please.

1058
01:27:40,344 --> 01:27:42,596
I suggest you go.

1059
01:27:54,399 --> 01:27:56,318
Don't come back.

1060
01:27:56,401 --> 01:27:58,570
I won't.

1061
01:27:58,654 --> 01:28:00,739
Don't worry.

1062
01:28:27,766 --> 01:28:31,937
Patrick Bateman's office.

1063
01:28:32,020 --> 01:28:35,732
Jean ? I need help.
Patrick, is that you ?

1064
01:28:36,775 --> 01:28:39,361
Jean, I'm not--

1065
01:28:39,444 --> 01:28:43,949
Craig McDermott called. Wants to meet you,
David Van Patten and Tim Bryce at Harry's.

1066
01:28:44,032 --> 01:28:47,911
Oh, God. What did you say,
you dumb bitch ?

1067
01:28:47,995 --> 01:28:51,874
Patrick, I can't hear you.
What am I doing ?

1068
01:28:51,957 --> 01:28:53,917
Where are you, Patrick ?
What's wrong ?

1069
01:28:56,044 --> 01:29:00,757
I don't think I'm gonna make it,Jean,
to the, uh,

1070
01:29:00,841 --> 01:29:02,759
office this afternoon.

1071
01:29:02,843 --> 01:29:04,761
Why ?

1072
01:29:04,845 --> 01:29:09,558
Just say no ! What is it, Patrick ?
Are you all right ?

1073
01:29:09,641 --> 01:29:13,812
Stop sounding
so fucking sad.

1074
01:29:13,896 --> 01:29:15,814
Jesus !

1075
01:30:33,058 --> 01:30:37,479
That's a table for three. Bateman,
you're looking wild-eyed. Rough day ?

1076
01:30:37,563 --> 01:30:40,482
Hey, look. Bryce is back and
he's drinking mineral water.

1077
01:30:40,566 --> 01:30:43,652
He's a changed man, except for he still
can't a reservation to save his life.

1078
01:30:43,735 --> 01:30:45,904
Why don't you just try
150 Wooster?

1079
01:30:45,988 --> 01:30:49,491
I'm not going anywhere
unless we have a reservation.

1080
01:30:49,575 --> 01:30:53,370
Le Cirque, Flamingo East, OysterBar.
Come on, faggots. Let's get a "res."

1081
01:30:53,453 --> 01:30:57,207
Keep your shirt on.
Maybe lose the suspenders.

1082
01:30:57,291 --> 01:30:59,293
Need a reservation
for 8:30.

1083
01:30:59,376 --> 01:31:01,920
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Right back.

1084
01:31:02,004 --> 01:31:04,423
10:00 would not be
any good. No.

1085
01:31:04,506 --> 01:31:07,843
Just fucking call them. Give me the phone.
I'll do it. I'll call you back.

1086
01:31:07,885 --> 01:31:11,305
Face it. The Japanese will own most
of this country by the end of the '90s.

1087
01:31:11,346 --> 01:31:14,349
Shut up, Carnes.
They will not.

1088
01:31:15,809 --> 01:31:19,480
So, uh, Harold,
did you get my message ?

1089
01:31:19,563 --> 01:31:23,775
Jesus, yes. That was hilarious.
That was you, wasn't it ?

1090
01:31:23,859 --> 01:31:27,613
Yeah, naturally. Bateman killing Allen
and the escort girls.

1091
01:31:27,696 --> 01:31:29,615
That's fabulous. That's rich.
What exactly do you mean ?

1092
01:31:29,698 --> 01:31:34,119
The message you left. By the way, Davis,
how's Cynthia ? You're still seeing her, right ?

1093
01:31:34,203 --> 01:31:36,288
W-Wait, Harold.
What do you mean ?

1094
01:31:36,371 --> 01:31:39,958
Excuse me. Nothing.
It's good to see you.

1095
01:31:40,042 --> 01:31:42,586
Is that Edward Towers ?

1096
01:31:42,669 --> 01:31:44,588
Carnes, wait. Uh--

1097
01:31:44,671 --> 01:31:50,427
Davis, I'm not one to bad-mouth anyone.
Your joke was amusing.

1098
01:31:50,511 --> 01:31:54,431
But come on, man.
You had one fatal flaw:

1099
01:31:54,515 --> 01:31:56,600
Bateman is such a dork.

1100
01:31:56,683 --> 01:32:00,312
Such a boring,
spineless lightweight.

1101
01:32:00,395 --> 01:32:04,233
Now, if you said Bryce or Mc Dermott.
Otherwise, it was amusing.

1102
01:32:04,316 --> 01:32:06,902
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I really must be going.

1103
01:32:06,985 --> 01:32:10,489
Wait. Uh-- Stop.

1104
01:32:11,782 --> 01:32:14,368
I did it, Carnes.

1105
01:32:14,451 --> 01:32:16,411
I killed him.

1106
01:32:16,453 --> 01:32:19,039
I'm Patrick Bateman.

1107
01:32:22,251 --> 01:32:24,503
I chopped Allen's
fucking head off.

1108
01:32:25,754 --> 01:32:30,759
The whole message
I left on your machine was true.

1109
01:32:30,843 --> 01:32:33,679
Excuse me.
I really must be going now.

1110
01:32:33,762 --> 01:32:36,932
No. No, listen.

1111
01:32:37,015 --> 01:32:39,518
Don't you know who I am ?

1112
01:32:39,601 --> 01:32:42,354
I'm not Davis.
I'm Patrick Bateman.

1113
01:32:45,065 --> 01:32:48,318
We talk on the phone
all the time.

1114
01:32:48,360 --> 01:32:50,988
Don't you recognize me ?

1115
01:32:52,364 --> 01:32:55,200
You're my lawyer.

1116
01:32:55,284 --> 01:32:59,872
Now, Carnes, listen.

1117
01:32:59,955 --> 01:33:02,207
Listen very, very carefully.

1118
01:33:05,919 --> 01:33:09,256
I killed Paul Allen,

1119
01:33:09,339 --> 01:33:11,341
and I liked it.

1120
01:33:11,383 --> 01:33:15,220
I can't make myself
any clearer.

1121
01:33:15,262 --> 01:33:19,391
But that's simply not possible.
And I don't find this funny anymore.

1122
01:33:19,475 --> 01:33:23,020
It never was supposed to be.
Why isn't it possible ?

1123
01:33:23,061 --> 01:33:27,357
It's just not.
Why not, you stupid bastard ?

1124
01:33:27,399 --> 01:33:29,693
Because I had dinner
with Paul Allen...

1125
01:33:29,735 --> 01:33:32,321
twice in London
just ten days ago.

1126
01:33:32,404 --> 01:33:34,490
No, you...

1127
01:33:37,242 --> 01:33:40,078
didn't.
Now, if you'll excuse me.

1128
01:34:21,286 --> 01:34:23,622
We've seen the results
of that mistrust...

1129
01:34:23,664 --> 01:34:27,209
in the form of lies,
provisions in the states.

1130
01:34:27,292 --> 01:34:31,755
We need to find a way to cooperate while
realizing foreign policy...

1131
01:34:31,797 --> 01:34:34,216
can't be run
by committee.

1132
01:34:34,299 --> 01:34:36,760
And I believe there's now
the growing sense...

1133
01:34:36,844 --> 01:34:40,764
that we can accomplish more
by cooperating.

1134
01:34:40,806 --> 01:34:44,768
And in the end, this maybe the eventual
blessing in disguise...

1135
01:34:44,852 --> 01:34:46,854
to come out of
the Iran-Contra mess.

1136
01:34:46,937 --> 01:34:50,566
How can he lie like that ?

1137
01:34:50,649 --> 01:34:52,609
How can he pull that shit ?
What shit ?

1138
01:34:52,651 --> 01:34:54,778
Now, where do we have
reservations at ?

1139
01:34:54,820 --> 01:34:57,823
I'm not really hungry, but I'd like
to have reservations someplace.

1140
01:34:57,906 --> 01:35:00,826
How can you be so fucking,

1141
01:35:00,909 --> 01:35:03,412
I don't know,
cool about it ?

1142
01:35:03,495 --> 01:35:06,957
Some guys arejust
born cool, I guess.

1143
01:35:11,670 --> 01:35:13,839
Bateman ?

1144
01:35:13,922 --> 01:35:19,178
- What are you so fucking zany about ?
- I'm just a happy camper.

1145
01:35:19,261 --> 01:35:21,722
Rockin' and a rollin' !

1146
01:35:21,805 --> 01:35:23,849
Oh, brother, look.

1147
01:35:23,932 --> 01:35:28,979
He presents himself as this harmless
old codger, but inside--

1148
01:35:29,021 --> 01:35:31,648
but inside--

1149
01:35:31,732 --> 01:35:34,651
But inside doesn't matter.

1150
01:35:34,693 --> 01:35:39,031
Inside ? Believe or not, Bryce,
we're actually listening to you.

1151
01:35:39,114 --> 01:35:41,700
Come on, Bateman.
What do you think ?

1152
01:35:44,620 --> 01:35:48,916
- Whatever.
- Whose moronic idea was it to order dry beers ?

1153
01:35:48,999 --> 01:35:51,001
I need a scotch.

1154
01:36:07,184 --> 01:36:10,229
There are no more barriers
to cross.

1155
01:36:10,312 --> 01:36:14,149
All I have in common with the
uncontrollable and the insane,

1156
01:36:14,233 --> 01:36:17,569
the vicious and the evil,
all the mayhem I have caused...

1157
01:36:17,611 --> 01:36:19,696
and my utter indifference
toward it,

1158
01:36:19,780 --> 01:36:22,366
I have now surpassed.

1159
01:36:25,035 --> 01:36:27,955
My pain is constant and sharp...

1160
01:36:28,038 --> 01:36:31,667
and I do not hope
for a better world for anyone.

1161
01:36:31,750 --> 01:36:36,255
In fact, I want my pain
to be inflicted on others.

1162
01:36:36,338 --> 01:36:38,924
I want no one to escape.

1163
01:36:40,050 --> 01:36:42,928
But even after admitting this,

1164
01:36:43,011 --> 01:36:45,180
there is no catharsis.

1165
01:36:45,264 --> 01:36:48,016
My punishment continues
to elude me...

1166
01:36:48,100 --> 01:36:51,311
and I gain no deeper knowledge
of myself.

1167
01:36:51,395 --> 01:36:55,149
No new knowledge can be
extracted from my telling.

1168
01:36:55,232 --> 01:36:59,403
This confession
has meant... nothing.

1169
01:38:18,398 --> 01:38:21,068
Word.

1170
01:39:15,164 --> 01:39:18,083
Come on.

1171
01:39:35,164 --> 01:39:58,083
for http://www.opensubtitles.org by boso
