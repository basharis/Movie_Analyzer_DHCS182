1
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,901
You? You again! Get out!

2
00:03:38,182 --> 00:03:40,463
Do what I told you.
Get out!

3
00:03:48,116 --> 00:03:51,185
Go on! Run! I'll teach you
to keep away from me!

4
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:53,653
Run!

5
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:01,327
Papa!

6
00:04:04,065 --> 00:04:06,264
You filthy dog!

7
00:04:06,434 --> 00:04:08,072
You'll settle with me!

8
00:04:30,391 --> 00:04:31,725
Let's go.

9
00:06:29,393 --> 00:06:31,260
Welcome to you, stranger.

10
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,284
My name is Juan de Dios.
I am the bell ringer.

11
00:06:35,917 --> 00:06:38,598
Why are you here?
To see the Rojos?

12
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,356
No, not the Rojos.
Is it the Baxters, maybe?

13
00:06:42,423 --> 00:06:44,124
No, maybe not
even the Baxters.

14
00:06:44,192 --> 00:06:47,227
You want to get rich? Well, for
that you have come to the right place,

15
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:48,906
if you use your head.

16
00:06:49,296 --> 00:06:53,059
That's because everybody here
has become very rich,

17
00:06:53,145 --> 00:06:54,501
or else they are dead.

18
00:06:54,903 --> 00:06:58,955
What you want to buy?
Some guns? Liquor?

19
00:06:59,213 --> 00:07:02,032
You don't buy. You sell.
You sell lead in exchange for gold.

20
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,475
You will get rich here,
or you'll be killed.

21
00:07:05,829 --> 00:07:08,079
Juan de Dios tolls the bell
once again.

22
00:07:24,334 --> 00:07:26,200
<i>Saludos, amigo!</i>

23
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:30,053
It's not smart to go
wandering so far from home.

24
00:07:32,299 --> 00:07:34,431
I reckon
he picked the wrong trail.

25
00:07:34,525 --> 00:07:36,469
Or he could have
picked the wrong town.

26
00:07:36,516 --> 00:07:39,187
His big mistake, I think,
was getting born.

27
00:07:39,364 --> 00:07:42,842
If you want any work,
looking like that

28
00:07:43,468 --> 00:07:45,348
you could try being a scarecrow.

29
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:49,606
Oh, no, the crows are liable
to scare him, maybe.

30
00:08:07,158 --> 00:08:08,591
Hello.

31
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,521
You can't get rich like that.

32
00:08:21,615 --> 00:08:24,801
At most, you will only
succeed in being killed.

33
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,080
With all of the trouble
we have, all we needed was you.

34
00:08:31,203 --> 00:08:34,477
What are you looking for?
Food and something to drink.

35
00:08:34,706 --> 00:08:37,944
Water's over there.
No, no water.

36
00:08:38,249 --> 00:08:40,044
Eating and drinking
and killing.

37
00:08:40,112 --> 00:08:43,661
That's all you can do,
just like the rest of your kind.

38
00:08:43,816 --> 00:08:47,784
By the way,
you'll have to mark this up.

39
00:08:48,087 --> 00:08:52,797
I know. You have no money.
After all, you just got into town.

40
00:08:53,055 --> 00:08:55,193
But if you don't mind
doing a little killing,

41
00:08:55,261 --> 00:08:58,842
you will have no trouble finding
someone eager to pay you.

42
00:09:03,602 --> 00:09:04,910
Hmm.

43
00:09:05,104 --> 00:09:08,283
My roulette wheel.
That, too, was bartered.

44
00:09:09,342 --> 00:09:11,542
No one ever comes here
to play.

45
00:09:11,727 --> 00:09:14,946
We spend our time here
between funerals and burials.

46
00:09:15,148 --> 00:09:17,482
Never saw a town
as dead as this one.

47
00:09:21,687 --> 00:09:23,629
You will never see another
like it.

48
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,424
What's wrong with the place?
We've had too many killings.

49
00:09:27,963 --> 00:09:29,415
You have seen the women?

50
00:09:29,578 --> 00:09:31,646
None of them are women.
They're widows.

51
00:09:31,852 --> 00:09:33,648
The place has only widows.

52
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:36,251
Here you can only gain respect
by killing other men.

53
00:09:36,397 --> 00:09:38,253
So nobody works anymore.

54
00:09:40,923 --> 00:09:43,261
Seems somebody doesn't
share your opinion.

55
00:09:43,492 --> 00:09:45,089
Yes.

56
00:09:54,436 --> 00:09:56,615
Know why Piripero
looked you over?

57
00:09:56,872 --> 00:09:58,840
To take your measurements.

58
00:09:59,075 --> 00:10:01,242
He is so experienced
he can do it with a glance.

59
00:10:01,394 --> 00:10:03,244
You will be a customer.

60
00:10:04,379 --> 00:10:06,247
Don't laugh. I'm not joking.

61
00:10:06,315 --> 00:10:09,969
I want to warn you that those murderers
will make a corpse out of you one day.

62
00:10:10,119 --> 00:10:12,359
That's why I want you
to get out of here.

63
00:10:12,898 --> 00:10:15,404
You don't want to stay
in this cemetery.

64
00:10:16,037 --> 00:10:17,992
Finish up and get out.

65
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:22,697
I told you
I can't pay you.

66
00:10:23,182 --> 00:10:24,775
Be my guest,

67
00:10:25,361 --> 00:10:28,119
but get out of San Miguel,
will you?

68
00:10:30,632 --> 00:10:32,085
Where does that lead?

69
00:10:32,554 --> 00:10:34,053
The balcony.

70
00:10:36,396 --> 00:10:39,147
Why are you going there? Hey.

71
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:41,516
To have a look.

72
00:10:41,667 --> 00:10:43,784
Things always look different
from higher up.

73
00:10:44,033 --> 00:10:45,586
But nothing's up there.

74
00:10:45,884 --> 00:10:47,522
Go ahead and get out!

75
00:10:56,427 --> 00:10:57,739
Who are they?

76
00:10:58,629 --> 00:11:01,956
Bandits.
Bandits and smugglers.

77
00:11:02,565 --> 00:11:03,938
They come down
from Texas.

78
00:11:04,111 --> 00:11:07,041
They cross the frontier to
stock up on guns and liquor.

79
00:11:07,344 --> 00:11:09,043
The cost is much less here.

80
00:11:09,218 --> 00:11:12,568
Then they go back and sell the
guns and liquor to the Indians.

81
00:11:14,283 --> 00:11:17,160
Any town that sells guns and
liquor has gotta be a rich one.

82
00:11:17,324 --> 00:11:20,221
Not the town,
only those who buy and sell,

83
00:11:20,289 --> 00:11:22,970
and the bosses are the ones
who clean up.

84
00:11:23,181 --> 00:11:26,494
Yeah? Somebody has to run the place.
Every town has a boss.

85
00:11:26,766 --> 00:11:29,097
That's true, but when
there are two around,

86
00:11:29,319 --> 00:11:31,615
then I'd say that
there is one too many.

87
00:11:31,873 --> 00:11:33,466
Two bosses?

88
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:35,973
Very interesting.

89
00:11:36,105 --> 00:11:38,081
Interesting is right.

90
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:41,109
The Rojos boys, three brothers
who sell liquor.

91
00:11:41,177 --> 00:11:45,391
And then there's the Baxters,
big gun merchants.

92
00:11:46,234 --> 00:11:50,358
If I'm not mistaken, you already
met Baxter's gang, didn't you?

93
00:11:50,586 --> 00:11:52,162
Yeah, we met.

94
00:11:52,443 --> 00:11:56,591
But you're lucky. They don't usually
limit their fire to the mule.

95
00:11:56,754 --> 00:11:59,659
A man leaves his own land and
looks around for any reason,

96
00:11:59,729 --> 00:12:03,865
Juan de Dios tolls the bell and
Piripero sells another coffin.

97
00:12:03,933 --> 00:12:05,366
Two bosses.

98
00:12:08,046 --> 00:12:12,239
They've enlisted all the scum that hangs
around both sides of the frontier,

99
00:12:12,374 --> 00:12:14,508
and they pay in dollars.

100
00:12:17,394 --> 00:12:19,034
The Baxters over there.

101
00:12:20,205 --> 00:12:21,751
The Rojos there.

102
00:12:22,918 --> 00:12:24,418
Me right in the middle.

103
00:12:24,486 --> 00:12:25,898
Where you do what?

104
00:12:27,957 --> 00:12:29,951
Crazy bell ringer
was right.

105
00:12:30,192 --> 00:12:32,622
There's money to be made
in a place like this.

106
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:37,265
If you're thinking what I suspect,
I tell you, don't try it.

107
00:12:38,479 --> 00:12:40,657
Which one of the two
is the stronger?

108
00:12:41,032 --> 00:12:43,609
Which one of them
is stronger?

109
00:12:44,101 --> 00:12:47,639
Well, the Rojos,
especially Ramon.

110
00:12:58,814 --> 00:13:03,219
Don Miguel Rojo,
I want to talk to you.

111
00:13:03,757 --> 00:13:07,131
Don Miguel, I hear
you're hiring on men.

112
00:13:07,881 --> 00:13:10,270
Well, I might
just be available.

113
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,933
I gotta tell you
before you hire me,

114
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,807
I don't work cheap.

115
00:13:35,432 --> 00:13:37,208
Get three coffins ready.

116
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,599
Listen, stranger.
Didn't you get the idea?

117
00:14:07,692 --> 00:14:10,082
We don't like to see
bad boys like you in town.

118
00:14:10,176 --> 00:14:11,816
Go get your mule.

119
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:14,932
You let him
get away from you?

120
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:17,837
That's what I want to talk
to you about.

121
00:14:18,188 --> 00:14:20,109
He's feeling real bad.

122
00:14:21,538 --> 00:14:22,780
My mule.

123
00:14:23,022 --> 00:14:26,833
He got all riled up when you men
fired those shots at his feet.

124
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:32,263
Hey, are you making
some kind of joke?

125
00:14:32,331 --> 00:14:34,353
Mmm-mmm. No.

126
00:14:34,845 --> 00:14:37,422
See, I understand you men
were just playing around.

127
00:14:37,539 --> 00:14:39,765
But the mule...
He just doesn't get it.

128
00:14:40,038 --> 00:14:42,473
Of course, if you were
to all apologize...

129
00:14:54,586 --> 00:14:56,797
I don't think it's nice,
you laughing.

130
00:15:00,803 --> 00:15:03,263
You see, my mule
don't like people laughing.

131
00:15:04,575 --> 00:15:07,246
He gets the crazy idea
you're laughing at him.

132
00:15:07,733 --> 00:15:10,807
Now, if you apologize,
like I know you're going to,

133
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,649
I might convince him that
you really didn't mean it.

134
00:15:43,435 --> 00:15:45,703
I saw the whole thing.
You killed all four of them.

135
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:49,861
You'll pay all right.
You'll be strung up.

136
00:15:52,579 --> 00:15:53,911
Who are you?

137
00:15:54,336 --> 00:15:55,929
Don't fire a shot.

138
00:15:57,749 --> 00:16:01,177
I'm John Baxter, sheriff.

139
00:16:02,604 --> 00:16:06,823
Yeah? Well, if you're the sheriff, you
better get these men underground.

140
00:16:20,552 --> 00:16:23,090
My mistake. Four coffins.

141
00:16:41,169 --> 00:16:43,019
I told you I wasn't cheap,

142
00:16:43,278 --> 00:16:45,667
but I think you'll find
it's worth your while.

143
00:16:45,747 --> 00:16:48,595
...97, 98, 99, 100.

144
00:16:49,517 --> 00:16:51,219
The rest
when you're all done.

145
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,749
When do I start?

146
00:16:54,689 --> 00:16:57,146
I'm not in a hurry,
at least for the moment.

147
00:16:57,662 --> 00:16:59,160
I'd say with
four less Baxters,

148
00:16:59,227 --> 00:17:01,728
right now is as good a time
to start as any.

149
00:17:01,902 --> 00:17:05,933
In a few days I hear there will be a troop
of cavalry passing through San Miguel.

150
00:17:06,049 --> 00:17:09,868
I wouldn't want the military sticking
their long noses into our business.

151
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:13,663
You seem to be well informed.

152
00:17:15,303 --> 00:17:20,387
In these parts, a man's life often
depends on a mere scrap of information.

153
00:17:21,566 --> 00:17:24,440
This thing couldn't have been
very useful to its owner.

154
00:17:26,988 --> 00:17:31,140
My brother Ramon did that. He often
uses it for target practice.

155
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:34,701
With a gun in his hand,
no one stands in his way.

156
00:17:35,463 --> 00:17:38,122
The suit of armor is
one of his favorite targets,

157
00:17:38,233 --> 00:17:40,886
naturally, when he does not
have anything better to shoot.

158
00:17:42,175 --> 00:17:45,994
Well, I'll be kind of curious
to meet this brother of yours.

159
00:17:47,075 --> 00:17:48,360
Ah.

160
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:52,132
This is Chico, one
of the most trusted of my men.

161
00:17:52,714 --> 00:17:55,599
Follow him. He will bring you
to your room.

162
00:17:55,883 --> 00:17:57,848
I would like you
to feel at home.

163
00:17:58,486 --> 00:18:01,644
Well, I never found home
that great, but let's go.

164
00:18:20,091 --> 00:18:21,440
Who's that?

165
00:18:21,838 --> 00:18:25,868
Her name's Marisol.
You just forget about her.

166
00:18:29,133 --> 00:18:31,301
This one will be your room.

167
00:19:02,467 --> 00:19:04,220
You gave him $100.

168
00:19:04,469 --> 00:19:07,270
We never pay that much.

169
00:19:07,338 --> 00:19:09,573
Can you explain to me
why you have taken him on?

170
00:19:09,641 --> 00:19:13,450
To have that filthy gringo around the
house and to give him $100 besides?

171
00:19:13,614 --> 00:19:15,933
We have never paid anybody
so much.

172
00:19:16,398 --> 00:19:19,073
You cannot leave someone like that
to do what he wants around here.

173
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,962
He's capable of doing anything. And
I want law and order in this place.

174
00:19:23,969 --> 00:19:28,022
If that is all you want,
there is a much cheaper way.

175
00:19:28,608 --> 00:19:30,318
Just snuff him out.

176
00:19:32,847 --> 00:19:34,606
And who will be the one? You?

177
00:19:34,699 --> 00:19:36,386
Yes, why not?

178
00:19:36,918 --> 00:19:38,284
A shot in his back,

179
00:19:38,354 --> 00:19:41,289
then you would have him out
of the way in no time at all.

180
00:19:42,658 --> 00:19:45,453
Listen, I could do it easily
right now.

181
00:19:46,741 --> 00:19:51,131
He won't be expecting it,
and I'd get back the $100.

182
00:19:54,068 --> 00:19:57,705
You're stupid, Esteban!
Even if you are my brother!

183
00:19:58,373 --> 00:20:01,575
A bullet in the back, eh?
And it is ended!

184
00:20:01,712 --> 00:20:04,218
And what happens if your hand
should tremble slightly?

185
00:20:04,345 --> 00:20:05,882
And he's only been hurt?

186
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:10,638
And with the cavalry arriving in town
and that Yankee so quick on the draw.

187
00:20:10,825 --> 00:20:13,566
I was only thinking... You
mustn't think of anything!

188
00:20:13,894 --> 00:20:15,815
You let me
do the thinking instead.

189
00:20:16,003 --> 00:20:20,694
Go and see the <i>americano</i>. Just ask him
if he needs anything and make friends.

190
00:20:22,263 --> 00:20:24,273
Get one thing clear
in that head of yours.

191
00:20:24,343 --> 00:20:27,851
This is going to be a quiet
town until Ramon gets back!

192
00:20:29,154 --> 00:20:32,489
Is that clear? A quiet town.

193
00:20:46,004 --> 00:20:48,474
I am Esteban Rojo.
My brother asked me to...

194
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:55,549
What are you doing?

195
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,384
Moving.

196
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,668
But didn't you know
all our men live here with us?

197
00:21:04,239 --> 00:21:09,395
That's all very cozy, but I don't
find you men all that appealing.

198
00:21:09,677 --> 00:21:13,659
Besides, your brother said he didn't
have any need for me anymore right now.

199
00:21:37,696 --> 00:21:39,453
Halt!

200
00:21:41,327 --> 00:21:43,928
- Sergeant?
- Yes, <i>Capitan</i>?

201
00:21:44,646 --> 00:21:47,091
Tell the men we'll be spending
tonight here in this place.

202
00:21:47,282 --> 00:21:49,383
Arrange it so they can
pick up the supplies here.

203
00:21:49,527 --> 00:21:51,985
Also, double the guard in order
to watch the stagecoach there.

204
00:21:52,128 --> 00:21:53,603
Yes, sir.

205
00:21:54,658 --> 00:21:57,174
What do you suppose they're
carrying in that coach?

206
00:21:57,242 --> 00:21:58,909
It'd be easy
to find out.

207
00:21:59,132 --> 00:22:01,645
Get up close to it and take a
little look at what's in it.

208
00:22:01,803 --> 00:22:04,333
If they fire at you,
you know it's gold.

209
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:07,004
Not a bad idea.

210
00:22:33,056 --> 00:22:34,696
Looking for anything?

211
00:22:36,195 --> 00:22:37,390
Hello.

212
00:22:37,882 --> 00:22:39,358
Get out of here, Yankee.

213
00:22:53,837 --> 00:22:55,430
Why aren't you sleeping?

214
00:22:56,554 --> 00:22:59,389
When I see you staring
like that, it bothers me.

215
00:23:00,186 --> 00:23:03,302
I still keep wondering
what was in that stagecoach.

216
00:23:03,536 --> 00:23:06,183
It's something they seem
to think is very important.

217
00:23:06,699 --> 00:23:10,400
I asked a few questions of the
captain and almost was arrested.

218
00:23:12,033 --> 00:23:13,704
Who's Marisol?

219
00:23:15,302 --> 00:23:17,733
You better get some sleep.
You need it.

220
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:20,709
It's much too dangerous,
even for you.

221
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:25,245
All I did is ask
who she was.

222
00:23:26,495 --> 00:23:28,018
She is a woman.

223
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,751
And Ramon's madly in love
with her.

224
00:23:30,853 --> 00:23:32,610
Does that make it clear
to you?

225
00:23:35,573 --> 00:23:38,584
Everybody in this town
talks about Ramon.

226
00:23:38,795 --> 00:23:40,575
Kind of curious
to meet him.

227
00:23:41,208 --> 00:23:45,027
If you are smart, you will try to stay
clear of Ramon as long as possible.

228
00:23:51,985 --> 00:23:56,010
There are the soldiers.
They are moving on very quietly.

229
00:24:00,815 --> 00:24:02,270
Strange.

230
00:24:02,996 --> 00:24:04,730
They're headed
for the frontier.

231
00:24:09,767 --> 00:24:11,058
Tell me,

232
00:24:13,632 --> 00:24:15,829
is that the way
you go to bed every night?

233
00:24:17,029 --> 00:24:19,466
Don't worry.
I didn't dirty the sheets.

234
00:24:21,319 --> 00:24:23,620
No, wait. I'm coming, too.

235
00:24:23,687 --> 00:24:26,963
I want to see for myself how you're
going to get yourself in trouble.

236
00:24:27,267 --> 00:24:28,931
All right. All right.
Go ahead.

237
00:25:14,455 --> 00:25:17,124
It's like playing cowboys
and Indians.

238
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,179
- Captain.
- Welcome, Lieutenant.

239
00:25:24,348 --> 00:25:26,306
There is your gold
as promised.

240
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:30,265
I hope the guns you will be giving us
will be equally useful to our army.

241
00:25:30,421 --> 00:25:33,790
Rest assured, Captain. We'll
check them over together.

242
00:27:07,602 --> 00:27:10,270
Get their clothes on again,
and hurry.

243
00:27:11,972 --> 00:27:13,907
Be sure to place them
around right.

244
00:27:14,004 --> 00:27:16,300
Remember. They died
fighting among themselves.

245
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:35,932
Rubio!

246
00:27:41,686 --> 00:27:43,887
There. It's Ramon.

247
00:27:57,885 --> 00:27:59,876
This is my brother Ramon.

248
00:28:00,555 --> 00:28:02,219
I think I mentioned him.

249
00:28:02,657 --> 00:28:04,458
Everybody talks about Ramon.

250
00:28:04,561 --> 00:28:08,521
And many speak of you, too,
my dear brother included.

251
00:28:08,872 --> 00:28:12,761
Well, I hope
they say nice things.

252
00:28:13,745 --> 00:28:15,168
Did you have a good trip?

253
00:28:15,953 --> 00:28:17,517
It was tiring.

254
00:28:17,955 --> 00:28:20,563
It was terribly hot
on the road during the day.

255
00:28:21,091 --> 00:28:25,201
And stagecoaches are an
uncomfortable way to travel.

256
00:28:25,446 --> 00:28:28,669
Well, I'm sure you'll be
in great shape in no time.

257
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:31,644
The <i>americano</i> cannot
wait to get into action.

258
00:28:32,353 --> 00:28:35,767
I am sorry. He's going
to be a disappointed man.

259
00:28:35,955 --> 00:28:37,032
How's that?

260
00:28:37,126 --> 00:28:39,094
The Baxters
accepted the invitation.

261
00:28:39,211 --> 00:28:41,156
They'll come tonight,
Don Miguel.

262
00:28:41,929 --> 00:28:44,084
The Baxters coming here?
You must be out of your head.

263
00:28:44,198 --> 00:28:47,083
Chico followed my orders. I
told him to invite them here.

264
00:28:47,301 --> 00:28:49,191
Ramon, what is this?

265
00:28:50,771 --> 00:28:53,140
I have found out many things
when I was traveling,

266
00:28:53,207 --> 00:28:56,478
and I have decided
that it's very stupid,

267
00:28:56,744 --> 00:29:00,847
to just keep on shooting at each
other and without any results.

268
00:29:01,093 --> 00:29:02,967
You've gone
out of your mind, Ramon.

269
00:29:03,384 --> 00:29:06,247
No, I have come
to my senses, Esteban.

270
00:29:06,762 --> 00:29:08,121
Believe me.

271
00:29:08,941 --> 00:29:10,123
Trust me.

272
00:29:11,354 --> 00:29:13,527
Life can be so precious.

273
00:29:13,721 --> 00:29:16,907
It's foolish to risk
losing it every minute, no?

274
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,241
There's plenty of space
for everybody in this town.

275
00:29:21,545 --> 00:29:23,092
Even Baxters.

276
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:26,325
For this reason,

277
00:29:27,871 --> 00:29:30,636
I've decided to hang
my gun up on the wall.

278
00:29:31,412 --> 00:29:33,564
I think that
Ramon has the right idea.

279
00:29:33,681 --> 00:29:36,891
I, too, am getting tired of these killings.
They must stop.

280
00:29:38,414 --> 00:29:41,654
This is all
very, very touching.

281
00:29:42,443 --> 00:29:44,130
You mean
you don't admire peace?

282
00:29:44,528 --> 00:29:47,574
It's not real easy to like
something you know nothing about.

283
00:29:48,652 --> 00:29:52,165
Stay in San Miguel and you may
just profit from the experience.

284
00:29:52,306 --> 00:29:55,402
No, thanks. I'll be moving on.

285
00:30:01,776 --> 00:30:04,255
Here's your money,
Don Miguel.

286
00:30:04,419 --> 00:30:06,574
I only used
a small amount of it.

287
00:30:06,785 --> 00:30:10,416
I don't like to take money
unless I feel I've earned it.

288
00:30:12,186 --> 00:30:14,961
Now, why are you so hasty?
You should stay here.

289
00:30:15,617 --> 00:30:17,655
You might enjoy
dining with us tonight.

290
00:30:18,241 --> 00:30:21,685
You see, the Baxters have four men
in the cemetery on account of me.

291
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:24,731
I don't think
they'd appreciate my presence.

292
00:30:32,557 --> 00:30:35,859
I don't like that <i>americano</i>.
He's too smart to be just a hired fighter.

293
00:30:36,187 --> 00:30:37,794
At shooting a pistol
no one can touch him.

294
00:30:37,862 --> 00:30:38,881
I can see that.

295
00:30:38,975 --> 00:30:42,866
When someone with that face works with
his gun, you may count on two things.

296
00:30:43,051 --> 00:30:45,869
He's fast on the trigger,
but he's also intelligent.

297
00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:48,627
That makes him too dangerous
for you, I think, my brothers.

298
00:30:48,768 --> 00:30:51,507
And now that he's gone, will you
please explain that silly nonsense

299
00:30:51,576 --> 00:30:54,133
about hanging up your gun and
making up with the Baxters?

300
00:30:55,234 --> 00:30:56,913
Is it possible, old fellow,

301
00:30:57,249 --> 00:31:00,107
that you'll never be able to reach
any conclusions on your own?

302
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:04,090
Don't you think our government and the
<i>americanos</i> will find those bodies,

303
00:31:04,183 --> 00:31:06,339
and then start
an investigation?

304
00:31:06,456 --> 00:31:07,791
They'll investigate,
all right,

305
00:31:08,059 --> 00:31:11,751
and we'll be quiet
and peacefully abide our time.

306
00:31:12,296 --> 00:31:15,265
We know nothing about the
massacre at the Rio Bravo, eh?

307
00:31:16,067 --> 00:31:18,367
I arranged for the bodies
to be lying,

308
00:31:18,498 --> 00:31:20,958
as if both companies
killed each other.

309
00:31:21,706 --> 00:31:24,167
But do you think
they'll believe it?

310
00:31:24,374 --> 00:31:26,604
Yes, I think so.

311
00:31:26,978 --> 00:31:29,079
Because if they don't
find some guilty party,

312
00:31:29,181 --> 00:31:32,273
it would be a pretty good reason
to call off the investigation.

313
00:31:32,549 --> 00:31:35,284
Yes, but what
about the Baxters?

314
00:31:35,352 --> 00:31:37,076
The Baxters?

315
00:31:38,222 --> 00:31:40,988
They want nothing more
than to live in peace.

316
00:31:41,191 --> 00:31:43,519
We'll let them have
their own way for a while.

317
00:31:43,694 --> 00:31:45,088
So forget about the Baxters.

318
00:31:45,182 --> 00:31:49,258
We'll take care of them later
when the investigation finishes.

319
00:31:55,656 --> 00:31:58,208
That was a fine idea
that you had.

320
00:31:58,393 --> 00:32:00,129
What was it again?

321
00:32:00,551 --> 00:32:02,566
Ah, yes, yes, yes.

322
00:32:03,131 --> 00:32:08,235
The Baxters on one side.
The Rojos on the other.

323
00:32:09,603 --> 00:32:11,492
And you'd be in the middle.

324
00:32:12,335 --> 00:32:14,795
The only problem is that
they've joined up.

325
00:32:17,513 --> 00:32:21,472
Now you are without a job, and you don't
have money to pay me what you owe me.

326
00:32:21,749 --> 00:32:25,252
There is only one thing for you to do.
Leave here immediately.

327
00:32:25,385 --> 00:32:27,165
I will forget about
what you owe me.

328
00:32:27,516 --> 00:32:31,101
And you leave San Miguel and never
come back for the rest of your days.

329
00:32:31,325 --> 00:32:35,154
Joe, I have prepared the wagon
the way you asked me to.

330
00:32:35,248 --> 00:32:38,645
It's sitting out in the back
here with two empty coffins.

331
00:32:38,926 --> 00:32:40,542
What are you up to?

332
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,580
Are you changing
your profession?

333
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,228
If you want to go on living,
you'd better.

334
00:32:45,589 --> 00:32:49,047
In my opinion,
you'll make a fine pallbearer.

335
00:32:51,295 --> 00:32:53,428
Close this place
and come with me, huh?

336
00:32:53,530 --> 00:32:57,738
Oh, close up?
It's done. Where are we going?

337
00:32:57,901 --> 00:33:01,018
I'd like to know where we are
going, or is it a secret?

338
00:33:02,239 --> 00:33:06,009
Down by the river. Have a look
at some corpses down there.

339
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:52,677
The Rojos say, "Come to
dinner," and we must go.

340
00:33:52,973 --> 00:33:54,903
But I don't like it at all,

341
00:33:55,746 --> 00:33:58,627
even if they've granted all the
guarantees we've demanded.

342
00:34:00,619 --> 00:34:04,227
We'll go along with it,
but don't touch anything.

343
00:34:04,461 --> 00:34:07,249
You mustn't eat.
You mustn't drink.

344
00:34:07,988 --> 00:34:11,654
You just keep your eyes open
and keep your wits about you.

345
00:34:38,169 --> 00:34:40,400
Are you sure
that nobody has seen us?

346
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:42,508
Only a ghost or two.

347
00:34:42,696 --> 00:34:45,577
Oh, no, no, no. Don't joke
about things like this.

348
00:34:45,671 --> 00:34:48,318
Ghosts are better left
where they are.

349
00:34:49,747 --> 00:34:52,349
You look as though this
place suits you very well.

350
00:34:52,606 --> 00:34:56,026
If you go on like this, you
will soon be here permanently.

351
00:35:08,771 --> 00:35:09,755
I do not understand.

352
00:35:09,825 --> 00:35:13,761
Why is it with all those bodies down by
the river we are just burying these two?

353
00:35:13,971 --> 00:35:16,272
We're not.
We're not gonna bury them.

354
00:35:16,339 --> 00:35:18,306
What do you mean
we're not burying them?

355
00:35:18,868 --> 00:35:21,258
That's right.
We're not gonna bury them.

356
00:35:22,713 --> 00:35:24,013
If we are not going to
bury them,

357
00:35:24,081 --> 00:35:26,506
I would like to know
what we will use them for?

358
00:35:27,351 --> 00:35:29,832
Why are we taking
the trouble to do this?

359
00:35:31,027 --> 00:35:33,390
The dead can be
very useful sometimes.

360
00:35:36,894 --> 00:35:39,742
They've helped me out of
tough spots more than once.

361
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:48,060
First, they don't talk.

362
00:35:50,426 --> 00:35:53,799
Second, they can be made to look
alive if I manage it right.

363
00:35:56,283 --> 00:35:58,204
And, third...

364
00:35:59,539 --> 00:36:01,717
Well, third, if you shoot
them, there's no worry,

365
00:36:01,785 --> 00:36:03,217
'cause they're dead already.

366
00:36:03,888 --> 00:36:05,162
Understand?

367
00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:08,508
It doesn't make a bit of sense
to me, and I'm getting out.

368
00:36:08,629 --> 00:36:10,710
I'm alive, and I want to remain
with the living, understand?

369
00:36:10,778 --> 00:36:12,679
And when I'm dead, I'll want
to remain with the dead.

370
00:36:12,747 --> 00:36:15,587
I would be unhappy if somebody living
forces me to remain with the living.

371
00:36:15,681 --> 00:36:17,297
I hope that's clear.

372
00:36:18,188 --> 00:36:22,155
And, also, I don't like the idea that
you've placed those bodies there!

373
00:36:22,311 --> 00:36:26,626
The man buried there is the only one who
died of pneumonia in this cursed town!

374
00:36:26,833 --> 00:36:28,543
Take it easy now, will you?

375
00:36:28,637 --> 00:36:31,565
These two friends of ours here
are gonna help me pay your bill.

376
00:36:32,268 --> 00:36:33,744
Get up there!

377
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:04,664
The only reason they could
have to start a war with us,

378
00:37:04,732 --> 00:37:07,574
would be to kidnap you
from your husband's side.

379
00:37:08,836 --> 00:37:10,854
He's gallant, this Rojo.

380
00:37:11,037 --> 00:37:13,595
I really didn't think him
capable of compliments.

381
00:37:13,993 --> 00:37:18,678
And he's not. All that he says
is false, like his proposals.

382
00:37:18,866 --> 00:37:23,458
You women. If things aren't complicated
for you, you become suspicious.

383
00:37:23,598 --> 00:37:27,417
Yes, because to me,
it just didn't seem right.

384
00:37:27,688 --> 00:37:31,190
It went too smoothly.
I don't trust them.

385
00:37:31,306 --> 00:37:33,649
You'd like to prove me wrong,
wouldn't you?

386
00:37:33,766 --> 00:37:35,383
Always the same thing.

387
00:37:37,866 --> 00:37:40,068
Good night.
Good night.

388
00:38:18,701 --> 00:38:20,880
Don't worry.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

389
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:25,528
I just want you to know why the Rojos
want to make peace all of a sudden.

390
00:38:27,297 --> 00:38:29,265
You see, there was once
a wagon load of gold

391
00:38:29,333 --> 00:38:31,750
that the soldiers
were taking to the border.

392
00:38:40,094 --> 00:38:42,433
John,
come up here quickly.

393
00:38:48,852 --> 00:38:53,822
Sorry, but when a husband finds
a man in his wife's bedroom,

394
00:38:53,891 --> 00:38:56,092
you're never sure
how he's gonna react.

395
00:38:59,372 --> 00:39:01,691
Give him $500.
How's that?

396
00:39:01,832 --> 00:39:03,519
Give the money to him.

397
00:39:04,351 --> 00:39:06,845
He has an interesting story.
Listen to him.

398
00:39:08,105 --> 00:39:10,102
That's the right idea?
You didn't misunderstand?

399
00:39:10,242 --> 00:39:12,140
I get the wrong idea only
when it suits me.

400
00:39:12,187 --> 00:39:13,443
- Ramon.
- What is it?

401
00:39:13,593 --> 00:39:15,311
The soldiers, the ones
who were escorting the gold...

402
00:39:15,379 --> 00:39:18,067
Two of those soldiers got away. They
are hiding out in the cemetery.

403
00:39:18,215 --> 00:39:20,855
The Baxters.
They're about to capture them.

404
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:25,564
Rubio! Get the men!

405
00:39:28,141 --> 00:39:29,898
You are well-informed, eh?

406
00:39:30,193 --> 00:39:34,256
A man's life in these parts often
depends on a mere scrap of information.

407
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:36,248
Your brother's own words.

408
00:39:36,669 --> 00:39:39,201
Tell me. Why are you
doing this for us?

409
00:39:42,773 --> 00:39:44,447
$500.

410
00:39:51,782 --> 00:39:54,709
With these two soldiers
as witnesses against Ramon,

411
00:39:54,818 --> 00:39:58,520
the government will be able to rid the
town of the Rojos and their whole band.

412
00:39:58,668 --> 00:40:01,058
Then San Miguel
will have just one boss.

413
00:40:01,324 --> 00:40:02,524
Hurry!

414
00:40:17,741 --> 00:40:19,191
Let's go!

415
00:40:22,799 --> 00:40:23,994
Coming with us?

416
00:40:24,114 --> 00:40:28,304
Oh, no. When a man's got money in his
pocket, he begins to appreciate peace.

417
00:40:29,405 --> 00:40:30,653
Come on!

418
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:41,915
Let's leave
the horses here.

419
00:42:04,874 --> 00:42:06,665
Who's there? Come out!

420
00:42:28,654 --> 00:42:30,270
What do you think?

421
00:42:30,691 --> 00:42:32,215
I don't know.

422
00:42:33,035 --> 00:42:35,027
There's something about it
I don't like.

423
00:42:35,213 --> 00:42:37,931
Too still to be wounded.
More like dummies.

424
00:42:38,306 --> 00:42:40,508
Sure, dummies that are
very interesting to the Rojos.

425
00:42:40,625 --> 00:42:42,234
Better hide. Hurry.

426
00:44:57,468 --> 00:44:58,520
What'll we do?

427
00:44:58,733 --> 00:45:00,739
Take two men
and circle around to the side.

428
00:45:00,935 --> 00:45:04,076
Try to keep them busy long enough
for me to get those two down there.

429
00:45:04,215 --> 00:45:06,769
Go on. Go on. Quickly.

430
00:45:43,972 --> 00:45:46,690
Keep me covered. I am going
to take care of those two.

431
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:28,251
Listen, Baxter! You can
have them now if you like!

432
00:46:28,438 --> 00:46:30,963
Since dead men can't talk!

433
00:46:42,472 --> 00:46:44,955
It seems
they didn't like my joke.

434
00:46:45,447 --> 00:46:48,165
We'll let them go home
in a little while.

435
00:48:32,383 --> 00:48:33,872
Keep this bad boy
as our guest,

436
00:48:33,965 --> 00:48:36,917
only until Baxter leaves San
Miguel and heads for the frontier.

437
00:48:37,058 --> 00:48:38,656
Put him in the cellar.

438
00:48:45,430 --> 00:48:47,097
Esteban, good work.

439
00:48:47,225 --> 00:48:51,335
With Antonio as our prisoner, the
Baxters have to give in to us.

440
00:48:51,466 --> 00:48:53,200
Now we can make
any kind of demand.

441
00:48:53,317 --> 00:48:55,683
Don Miguel! Don Miguel!

442
00:49:00,678 --> 00:49:02,992
What has happened?
Talk, will you?

443
00:49:03,248 --> 00:49:05,883
I don't know,
but somebody shot at me.

444
00:49:06,085 --> 00:49:07,444
Marisol!

445
00:49:08,987 --> 00:49:10,607
Marisol!

446
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:13,023
Where are you, Marisol?

447
00:49:26,538 --> 00:49:29,339
It's strange how you always
manage to be

448
00:49:29,407 --> 00:49:31,598
in the right place
at the right time.

449
00:49:38,383 --> 00:49:42,703
It's nothing serious. A headache
that will pass. She'll sleep.

450
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:51,535
Keep your eyes open. She's not to
move from that room. You hear?

451
00:49:58,970 --> 00:50:01,750
I wouldn't mention anything
about me bringing her here.

452
00:50:01,939 --> 00:50:04,889
I wouldn't want the Rojos
to think I was on your side.

453
00:50:05,334 --> 00:50:06,810
Don't be worried.

454
00:50:06,944 --> 00:50:11,941
I'm a woman who's rich enough to
appreciate the men my money can buy.

455
00:50:12,573 --> 00:50:14,051
I've been to talk
to the Rojos.

456
00:50:14,190 --> 00:50:16,320
They'll give back Antonio
in exchange for Marisol.

457
00:50:16,387 --> 00:50:18,196
It'll take place
in the morning.

458
00:50:21,159 --> 00:50:24,053
Very soon
you are going to be rich.

459
00:50:29,910 --> 00:50:33,120
Yeah, and that's not
gonna break my heart.

460
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:18,570
Where is she? You said
I'd be able to see her!

461
00:52:18,733 --> 00:52:20,104
Where is she?

462
00:52:21,497 --> 00:52:23,507
I wanna see her!

463
00:52:23,576 --> 00:52:25,714
Come back here, Jesus.
Come here. Where is she?

464
00:52:25,949 --> 00:52:28,619
I want to see her!
I want to see her!

465
00:52:28,737 --> 00:52:32,649
Why can't I look at her?
I want to see her!

466
00:52:51,152 --> 00:52:53,711
Go. Go to him, Marisol.

467
00:53:18,547 --> 00:53:19,950
Mama!

468
00:53:22,949 --> 00:53:25,573
Mama!
Jesus!

469
00:53:32,671 --> 00:53:33,911
Mama!

470
00:53:36,247 --> 00:53:37,398
Jesus!

471
00:53:37,465 --> 00:53:39,653
Mama! Mama!

472
00:54:29,784 --> 00:54:30,884
Julio!

473
00:54:32,086 --> 00:54:33,396
Marisol.

474
00:54:35,318 --> 00:54:36,657
Get Julio.

475
00:54:47,152 --> 00:54:49,281
You were warned
to get out of town.

476
00:54:50,195 --> 00:54:53,404
Now I'm gonna make you
pay once and for all.

477
00:54:55,327 --> 00:54:57,211
Let him be.

478
00:55:36,101 --> 00:55:38,362
You better get going.
Ramon's waiting.

479
00:55:42,491 --> 00:55:45,765
And, you, get that kid
home where he belongs.

480
00:56:33,137 --> 00:56:34,926
A pig, that Ramon.

481
00:56:36,042 --> 00:56:38,759
What's Ramon
got to do with them?

482
00:56:39,041 --> 00:56:40,470
You weren't told, eh?

483
00:56:43,445 --> 00:56:45,636
In this part of the world,
the story is very old.

484
00:56:45,704 --> 00:56:48,482
A happy little family
until trouble comes along.

485
00:56:49,007 --> 00:56:50,607
And trouble has
the name of Ramon.

486
00:56:50,675 --> 00:56:53,344
Claiming the husband cheated
at cards, which wasn't true,

487
00:56:53,411 --> 00:56:56,565
he gets the wife
to live with him as hostage.

488
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:58,392
And the husband?

489
00:56:58,650 --> 00:57:01,110
Him? There's nothing
for him to do.

490
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,222
The Rojos threatened
to kill his little boy Jesus,

491
00:57:04,343 --> 00:57:06,592
and he was forced
to accept things.

492
00:57:09,461 --> 00:57:11,418
That Ramon is smart.

493
00:57:13,386 --> 00:57:15,266
Where are you going?

494
00:57:19,173 --> 00:57:21,281
To the Rojos
to look for a job.

495
00:57:27,466 --> 00:57:29,903
I am glad we have the
<i>americano</i> with us.

496
00:57:30,082 --> 00:57:32,550
It's the best thing that could
have happened to us, you know,

497
00:57:32,918 --> 00:57:35,920
'cause if either government
starts an inquiry,

498
00:57:35,987 --> 00:57:37,988
we'll need every man
we can get.

499
00:57:39,457 --> 00:57:43,046
I guess you know to be at war
with the Baxters now,

500
00:57:43,116 --> 00:57:44,967
is worse than sitting
on a big case of dynamite.

501
00:57:45,060 --> 00:57:47,989
Where should we put this?
Put it over there.

502
00:57:55,823 --> 00:57:58,203
Come on, everybody!
Drink up!

503
00:58:29,975 --> 00:58:32,476
Good shooting.
Very good shooting.

504
00:58:32,642 --> 00:58:34,745
When you want to kill a man,
you must shoot for his heart.

505
00:58:34,813 --> 00:58:37,562
And the Winchester
is the best weapon.

506
00:58:37,715 --> 00:58:40,678
That's very nice,
but I'll stick with my .45.

507
00:58:41,592 --> 00:58:44,755
When a man with a .45
meets a man with a rifle,

508
00:58:44,923 --> 00:58:48,152
the man with the pistol
will be a dead man.

509
00:58:48,761 --> 00:58:51,736
That's an old Mexican proverb,
and it's true.

510
00:58:53,164 --> 00:58:54,782
You believe that?

511
00:58:56,567 --> 00:58:59,772
Paquito, take five men and escort
Marisol to the small house.

512
00:58:59,866 --> 00:59:01,972
And stay there till I return.

513
00:59:11,082 --> 00:59:13,759
Everything's prepared.
Do not be worried.

514
00:59:14,386 --> 00:59:16,219
I will return tomorrow.

515
00:59:16,455 --> 00:59:18,163
All the wagons are ready.
We can leave.

516
00:59:18,257 --> 00:59:22,357
Everyone, enjoy yourselves
during my absence.

517
00:59:39,861 --> 00:59:42,429
You heard Ramon.
Let's have a good time.

518
00:59:50,798 --> 00:59:54,523
<i>~ Do you remember</i>
<i>sweet Becky from Pike ~</i>

519
00:59:54,943 --> 00:59:57,967
<i>~ She roamed the world</i>
<i>with her lover Ike ~</i>

520
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:00,708
<i>~ Ike and Betsy ~</i>

521
01:00:00,949 --> 01:00:02,716
<i>~ Betsy from Pike ~</i>

522
01:00:06,214 --> 01:00:07,854
He weighs over a ton.

523
01:00:08,018 --> 01:00:10,431
Of course, with all he
poured into himself.

524
01:01:27,902 --> 01:01:28,902
Papa,

525
01:01:30,238 --> 01:01:33,272
did you not tell me
no one could go see Mama?

526
01:01:34,842 --> 01:01:36,317
That's right.

527
01:01:36,833 --> 01:01:39,480
Then why does that man see her
when I cannot?

528
01:01:43,118 --> 01:01:45,986
- I want Mama.
- Go away from the door.

529
01:01:46,054 --> 01:01:48,992
Quiet! Quiet.
We cannot show ourselves.

530
01:01:49,090 --> 01:01:51,458
You must remember that.
You must stay away.

531
01:02:02,370 --> 01:02:03,705
Hello.

532
01:02:23,975 --> 01:02:25,943
There's somebody shooting
up at the small house.

533
01:02:26,011 --> 01:02:29,124
Saddle the horses immediately!
Come on. Let's go!

534
01:02:57,342 --> 01:02:59,065
Look out!

535
01:03:46,553 --> 01:03:48,568
Here you are.
Now, take this money.

536
01:03:49,247 --> 01:03:52,411
It's enough to live on for a while.
Now, get across the border.

537
01:03:52,580 --> 01:03:55,266
Get as much distance between
yourselves and San Miguel as possible.

538
01:03:55,333 --> 01:03:57,494
How may we thank you
for what you are doing?

539
01:03:58,431 --> 01:04:01,571
Don't try. Just get going
before the Rojos get here.

540
01:04:05,788 --> 01:04:07,561
Why do you do this for us?

541
01:04:09,044 --> 01:04:12,215
Why? 'Cause I knew
someone like you once.

542
01:04:12,324 --> 01:04:14,685
There was no one there
to help. Now, get moving.

543
01:04:17,783 --> 01:04:19,493
Get moving.

544
01:04:20,454 --> 01:04:22,234
Get out of here!

545
01:05:04,635 --> 01:05:06,864
What do you see, Chico?

546
01:05:07,004 --> 01:05:10,027
They're all dead.
They massacred them.

547
01:05:10,508 --> 01:05:12,089
They kidnapped Marisol!

548
01:05:12,370 --> 01:05:14,080
This looks like
the work of the Baxters.

549
01:05:14,312 --> 01:05:17,614
Quick, let's get back before
they attack our house and the town.

550
01:07:12,814 --> 01:07:15,390
Chico,
give out the ammunition.

551
01:07:15,549 --> 01:07:19,420
Esteban, spread your men around the house.
Keep your eyes open.

552
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:22,582
Miguel, Paco, Vincente,
Martin, behind the house.

553
01:07:22,657 --> 01:07:26,307
Manolo and Alvaro,
come with me. Stay alert.

554
01:07:26,565 --> 01:07:30,407
The way they killed the men in the small
house, there must be a lot of them.

555
01:07:38,223 --> 01:07:40,157
It's a warm evening.

556
01:07:43,711 --> 01:07:48,376
One of our wagons lost a wheel, so we
had to turn back here to get help.

557
01:07:49,934 --> 01:07:52,359
One of the men tells me,

558
01:07:53,179 --> 01:07:56,108
the Baxters
attacked the small house.

559
01:07:57,608 --> 01:07:59,481
Do you know about it?

560
01:08:03,066 --> 01:08:04,823
Tell me what you know.

561
01:08:25,202 --> 01:08:26,306
Well?

562
01:08:27,665 --> 01:08:29,372
Where did you hide Marisol?

563
01:08:32,351 --> 01:08:33,475
Rubio.

564
01:08:59,420 --> 01:09:02,034
You are thirsty.
You want to drink?

565
01:09:02,854 --> 01:09:05,759
No, no,
it is too soon to drink.

566
01:09:09,437 --> 01:09:11,314
Bring him over here!

567
01:09:40,061 --> 01:09:41,728
You are behaving
like a stubborn idiot.

568
01:09:41,885 --> 01:09:44,314
Tell us where Marisol is,
and it will all be ended!

569
01:09:44,509 --> 01:09:45,649
In a week,
you'll be back in shape.

570
01:09:45,717 --> 01:09:48,374
You'll get out and you can go
wherever you want.

571
01:10:00,014 --> 01:10:01,705
That's enough for today.

572
01:10:02,650 --> 01:10:05,922
Sooner or later, he'll talk.
It's just a matter of time.

573
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:09,670
Watch out he doesn't escape or die.
Otherwise, do as you like.

574
01:10:14,426 --> 01:10:18,151
But wait till he comes to.
This way, he hardly feels anything.

575
01:10:50,365 --> 01:10:52,825
I've had a poker hand waiting
for me for three days.

576
01:10:53,012 --> 01:10:56,409
Now I'm stuck here! I can't get to it
while I'm guarding this <i>americano</i> idiot!

577
01:10:56,550 --> 01:10:58,471
I think you will find this
more amusing than cards.

578
01:10:58,588 --> 01:11:00,857
All orders are to be sure
he does not die,

579
01:11:00,925 --> 01:11:04,515
and also make sure he regrets
the day he was born.

580
01:11:06,342 --> 01:11:08,803
The gringo is asleep,
I imagine.

581
01:11:08,949 --> 01:11:11,942
That's all right.
I'll enjoy waking him up.

582
01:12:15,806 --> 01:12:19,086
- Esteban, what was that noise?
- I do not know.

583
01:12:19,250 --> 01:12:21,335
I heard a yell,
and then a crash.

584
01:12:53,454 --> 01:12:55,388
It's useless to hide.

585
01:12:57,524 --> 01:12:59,640
You're finished playing
the smart boy.

586
01:13:01,462 --> 01:13:03,396
Go up
and look in the loft.

587
01:13:04,958 --> 01:13:07,137
And take a look
behind the barrels!

588
01:13:18,946 --> 01:13:20,491
Let's get out of here!

589
01:13:30,893 --> 01:13:33,236
Hurry! Quick!

590
01:13:33,376 --> 01:13:37,289
Hurry with that water!
Hey, you, come with me!

591
01:13:51,378 --> 01:13:54,977
Surround the town! Block all
the streets leading out!

592
01:13:55,115 --> 01:13:57,050
Find him for me!

593
01:13:58,419 --> 01:14:01,520
Esteban, search the whole town.
Follow me!

594
01:14:02,889 --> 01:14:06,550
Get him back right now!
You've got to at any cost!

595
01:14:06,626 --> 01:14:10,439
Look in the stables, in every
corral, in the storeroom!

596
01:14:10,533 --> 01:14:12,267
Look for him in the church!

597
01:14:12,477 --> 01:14:15,051
Go in there!
Search every inch of it!

598
01:14:15,119 --> 01:14:18,709
Search everywhere!
Rubio, in here!

599
01:14:19,482 --> 01:14:22,270
If somebody is hiding
him, burn their house down,

600
01:14:22,411 --> 01:14:23,957
and kill them like dogs!

601
01:14:24,472 --> 01:14:26,089
You, up here!

602
01:14:26,396 --> 01:14:30,236
Look for him near the Baxters, but
take him alive! I want him alive!

603
01:14:30,540 --> 01:14:31,968
Alive!

604
01:14:33,609 --> 01:14:36,163
Rubio, in the bar.

605
01:15:06,619 --> 01:15:09,839
He says he knows nothing.
He's trying to be smart.

606
01:15:09,907 --> 01:15:11,516
Bring him here to me.

607
01:15:13,671 --> 01:15:15,639
I swear,
I'm telling the truth.

608
01:15:15,944 --> 01:15:18,919
Well,
you know nothing, huh?

609
01:15:19,926 --> 01:15:23,675
- Nothing. I've not seen him.
- Rubio, you take care of him.

610
01:16:05,119 --> 01:16:06,862
Where have you hidden him?

611
01:16:08,365 --> 01:16:11,267
I didn't...

612
01:16:15,755 --> 01:16:18,871
You're the right friend
for that filthy <i>americano</i>.

613
01:16:19,035 --> 01:16:20,860
And you'll end up
the same way.

614
01:16:22,057 --> 01:16:23,603
We looked everywhere.

615
01:16:23,931 --> 01:16:26,696
In his cellar, in the attic,
on the roof.

616
01:16:26,813 --> 01:16:28,805
But there is no trace.

617
01:16:29,109 --> 01:16:31,171
I couldn't find anybody there
in the back room.

618
01:16:31,264 --> 01:16:34,140
I'm certain he has taken
refuge with the Baxters.

619
01:16:34,380 --> 01:16:35,880
The <i>americano</i> isn't stupid.

620
01:16:35,997 --> 01:16:38,527
He knows that that's the
best place for him to hide.

621
01:16:40,981 --> 01:16:42,861
The Baxters, eh?

622
01:16:44,126 --> 01:16:45,743
Then better go and get him.

623
01:16:50,311 --> 01:16:52,115
And that's for
being his friend.

624
01:17:26,929 --> 01:17:28,311
Curse them.

625
01:17:34,567 --> 01:17:35,926
Piripero.

626
01:17:36,277 --> 01:17:37,495
Eh?

627
01:17:44,781 --> 01:17:45,929
Piripero.

628
01:17:57,713 --> 01:18:00,197
- Come here.
- I can't see anybody.

629
01:18:01,485 --> 01:18:02,586
Come here.

630
01:18:03,336 --> 01:18:04,812
<i>Dios mio!</i>

631
01:18:12,332 --> 01:18:14,230
What are you doing in there?

632
01:18:15,730 --> 01:18:17,626
Never mind.
Get me out of here.

633
01:18:18,213 --> 01:18:20,345
But you're not dead yet.

634
01:18:20,509 --> 01:18:23,083
I will be if you don't get
me out of here, quick.

635
01:18:23,227 --> 01:18:24,585
Get that lid down.

636
01:19:51,620 --> 01:19:52,628
Rubio.

637
01:20:14,673 --> 01:20:16,665
I see some signs of life.

638
01:20:17,625 --> 01:20:20,085
Let's be ready
when they decide to come out.

639
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:26,903
Don't shoot!
We surrender!

640
01:20:26,973 --> 01:20:28,238
Don't shoot!

641
01:20:29,480 --> 01:20:33,486
Stop! Don't shoot!
We're coming out!

642
01:20:36,180 --> 01:20:39,741
- I'm surrendering! Hold back your fire!
- Don't shoot!

643
01:20:39,835 --> 01:20:41,756
We're surrendering!

644
01:21:10,830 --> 01:21:12,142
Stop.

645
01:21:12,985 --> 01:21:14,883
I wanna take a look at this.

646
01:22:51,100 --> 01:22:55,203
Ramon, don't shoot!
We're coming out!

647
01:22:58,574 --> 01:23:00,238
We surrender!

648
01:23:00,376 --> 01:23:03,214
Listen, you've won.
It's enough!

649
01:23:03,448 --> 01:23:05,880
I'll get out of town!
I'll do whatever you like!

650
01:23:05,978 --> 01:23:08,555
- You promise that?
- I swear it, Ramon!

651
01:23:09,185 --> 01:23:11,390
You won't try a trick
of any kind?

652
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:14,014
None! No, no tricks!

653
01:23:14,156 --> 01:23:16,685
I said before, I give you my word.
We'll leave!

654
01:23:16,778 --> 01:23:20,457
Are you sure? You had better
ask permission of your wife.

655
01:23:22,143 --> 01:23:24,182
Maybe she won't be too happy!

656
01:23:37,723 --> 01:23:39,013
Antonio!

657
01:23:40,605 --> 01:23:41,612
John!

658
01:24:06,492 --> 01:24:07,992
Murderers.

659
01:24:09,725 --> 01:24:11,670
They had no guns.

660
01:24:12,279 --> 01:24:15,278
Murderers!
I hope you rot in hell!

661
01:24:15,348 --> 01:24:17,738
May you and your brothers
die spitting blood!

662
01:24:17,808 --> 01:24:19,167
Curse you for this!

663
01:24:19,940 --> 01:24:21,697
Murderers!

664
01:24:44,141 --> 01:24:46,764
Let's go.
The show's over, anyway.

665
01:24:51,053 --> 01:24:54,660
Keep looking for him.
Search among those bodies.

666
01:24:54,957 --> 01:24:57,224
The filthy <i>americano</i>
has to be somewhere!

667
01:27:16,382 --> 01:27:17,782
Silvanito?

668
01:27:22,571 --> 01:27:24,224
Where's Silvanito?

669
01:27:27,692 --> 01:27:29,376
Any news today?

670
01:27:29,636 --> 01:27:32,313
I have to tell you
some news that's pretty bad.

671
01:27:32,380 --> 01:27:36,149
I hate to tell you this, Joe, but...
Where is Silvanito?

672
01:27:37,344 --> 01:27:41,514
Silvanito, he was captured this
morning by those men of Ramon's.

673
01:27:41,772 --> 01:27:44,653
They grabbed him outside the village.
He was on his way to this mine.

674
01:27:44,727 --> 01:27:47,762
He was bringing in some provisions.
Ramon's got him now.

675
01:27:47,933 --> 01:27:49,901
He's being tortured,
but he won't talk.

676
01:27:49,995 --> 01:27:51,893
I know him well.
He's a stubborn man.

677
01:27:52,033 --> 01:27:55,970
No matter what they do, he won't say
a word, even if it means his life.

678
01:27:56,063 --> 01:27:59,073
Listen to me. They'll never
be able to force him.

679
01:28:10,402 --> 01:28:13,774
Now, old fool,
loosen up your tongue.

680
01:28:17,009 --> 01:28:19,327
No.
Rubio!

681
01:28:21,479 --> 01:28:23,948
You better get back
to your shop, old man.

682
01:28:24,106 --> 01:28:26,918
- You're liable to have some business.
- Very good!

683
01:28:26,985 --> 01:28:28,920
That's what
I wanted to hear.

684
01:28:29,002 --> 01:28:32,223
And I have a little surprise
for you that I brought along.

685
01:28:32,376 --> 01:28:33,991
I know how much
you are going to need it.

686
01:28:34,059 --> 01:28:35,960
It was very hard
to get my hands on it.

687
01:28:36,054 --> 01:28:40,497
But I got it by first using my head.
No one can resist two barrels of wine.

688
01:28:40,716 --> 01:28:43,176
Isn't that right?
Then I thought that,

689
01:28:43,293 --> 01:28:47,004
well, you might need that pistol,
and I brought another present.

690
01:28:48,740 --> 01:28:52,711
It's dynamite.
I stole it from the Rojos.

691
01:28:53,178 --> 01:28:54,378
And now it seems to me

692
01:28:54,446 --> 01:28:57,280
the moment's come
for you to light the fuse

693
01:28:57,421 --> 01:28:59,178
and send it back to them.

694
01:29:18,881 --> 01:29:20,403
Still lots of light.

695
01:29:24,209 --> 01:29:26,869
Too early to be asleep, yet.

696
01:29:31,016 --> 01:29:32,469
Rubio, here.

697
01:29:38,156 --> 01:29:42,493
I shouldn't like to ruin the rifle.
I could never find another like this.

698
01:29:43,996 --> 01:29:46,736
Listen, Ramon, let's try it
with this one now.

699
01:31:51,956 --> 01:31:53,716
Gringo!

700
01:32:00,510 --> 01:32:02,244
Heard you wanted
to see me.

701
01:32:03,751 --> 01:32:05,711
The <i>americano</i>'s dead.

702
01:32:07,468 --> 01:32:09,306
Let the old man down.

703
01:32:27,375 --> 01:32:29,420
What's wrong, Ramon?

704
01:32:30,474 --> 01:32:32,325
You losing your touch?

705
01:32:40,722 --> 01:32:42,141
Are you afraid, Ramon?

706
01:32:45,794 --> 01:32:48,256
You shoot to kill,
you better hit the heart.

707
01:32:50,294 --> 01:32:52,215
Your own words, Ramon.

708
01:33:08,591 --> 01:33:10,208
The heart, Ramon.

709
01:33:10,700 --> 01:33:12,453
Don't forget the heart.

710
01:33:15,774 --> 01:33:18,782
Aim for the heart
or you'll never stop me.

711
01:34:55,206 --> 01:34:58,820
When a man with a .45
meets a man with a rifle,

712
01:34:59,429 --> 01:35:01,889
you said the man
with the pistol's a dead man.

713
01:35:02,967 --> 01:35:04,841
Let's see if that's true.

714
01:35:28,990 --> 01:35:31,244
Go ahead, load up and shoot.

715
01:37:36,718 --> 01:37:38,528
Hey, listen, Joe.

716
01:37:38,953 --> 01:37:42,206
Listen, Joe, I... I...

717
01:37:43,448 --> 01:37:45,978
Oh, Joe, Joe.

718
01:38:17,957 --> 01:38:21,729
Well, guess your government will
be glad to see that gold back.

719
01:38:22,397 --> 01:38:26,579
And you, you don't want to be
here when they get it, eh?

720
01:38:28,469 --> 01:38:31,311
You mean, the Mexican
government on one side,

721
01:38:31,573 --> 01:38:33,865
and maybe the Americans
on the other side?

722
01:38:34,209 --> 01:38:36,043
Me, right smack in the middle?

723
01:38:37,754 --> 01:38:39,246
Too dangerous.

724
01:38:40,948 --> 01:38:43,681
- So long.
- <i>Adiós</i>.
