1
00:00:04,499 --> 00:00:06,424


2
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,400
Pull yourself together Teddy!

3
00:01:10,559 --> 00:01:11,959
Pull yourself together!

4
00:01:17,039 --> 00:01:18,489
It's just water.

5
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:22,214
It's a lot of water.

6
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:29,189
Come on.

7
00:01:52,119 --> 00:01:56,469
- You okay boss?
- Yeah, I'm fine. I just... I just can't

8
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:00,009
I just can't stomach the water.

9
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:05,564
- So you're my new partner?
- That's right.

10
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:08,958
Not the best way to meet with my head
halfway down the toilet.

11
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,593
Doesn't exactly square with Teddy Daniels:
The man. The legend. I'll give you that.

12
00:02:12,594 --> 00:02:13,569
The Legend?

13
00:02:14,559 --> 00:02:16,718
What the hell are you boys smoking
out there in Portland anyway?

14
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:17,344
Seattle.

15
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:21,314
I came from the office in Seattle.

16
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:24,518
How long have you been with Marshals?

17
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:25,494
Four years.

18
00:02:27,839 --> 00:02:30,264
- So you know how small it is?
- Sure

19
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:35,539
What about you? You got a girl? Married?

20
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:36,839
I was.

21
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:49,544
She died.

22
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:54,269
- Jesus... I didn't...
- Don't worry about it.

23
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:58,238
There was a fire in our apartment
building while I was at work

24
00:02:58,239 --> 00:02:59,714
Four People died.

25
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:03,238
It was the smoke that got her
not the fire. So...

26
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:05,558
- So that's important.
- I'm sorry Boss.

27
00:03:05,559 --> 00:03:07,959
Where are my goddamn cigarettes?

28
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:10,838
Well here. Have one of mine.

29
00:03:10,839 --> 00:03:14,158
I could of sworn they were in my jacket
when I got on.

30
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:17,084
Government employees will rob you blind.

31
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:19,589
Thanks.

32
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:23,678
They give you a briefing
about the institution before you left?

33
00:03:23,679 --> 00:03:26,879
All I know is it's a mental hospital.

34
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,719
For the criminally insane.

35
00:03:30,359 --> 00:03:32,438
Well, if it was just folks running around,
hearing voices,

36
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:37,114
and chasing after butterflies,
they wouldn't need us.

37
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:47,718
- That's where we're headed?
- Yup.

38
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:50,158
The other side of the island is rock bluffs

39
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,034
all the way down to the edge
of the water.

40
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:56,114
The dock, it's the
only way on...or off.

41
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:59,838
We will be casting off as soon as
you two are ashore.

42
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:02,318
I'd appreciate if you'd hurry up about it.

43
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,444
- Why?
- Storm's coming.

44
00:04:30,359 --> 00:04:33,809
I've never seen a marshal's
badge before.

45
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:36,438
I'm Deputy Warden
McPherson, gentlemen.

46
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:41,889
Welcome to Shutter Island.
I'll be the one taking you up to Ashecliffe.

47
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:55,238
Your boys seem a little on edge
Mr. McPherson.

48
00:04:55,239 --> 00:04:57,839
Right now, Marshal. We all are.

49
00:05:14,239 --> 00:05:18,914
"Remember us for we too have
lived, loved and laughed"

50
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:41,439
Electrified perimeter.

51
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:44,614
How could you tell?

52
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:48,864
I've seen something like it before.

53
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:18,958
All right. You gentlemen will be accorded
all the help we can give.

54
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:23,518
But during the stay you will
obey protocol. Is that understood?

55
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:24,444
Absolutely.

56
00:06:25,359 --> 00:06:28,638
The red brick bulding on my right
is ward A, the male ward.

57
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,518
Ward B, the female ward, is the one
on the left.

58
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:34,744
Ward C is that building on the bluffs.
An old civil war fort.

59
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:38,838
The most dangerous patients
are housed there.

60
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:42,958
Admittance to ward C is forbidden without
the written consent and

61
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:45,718
physical presence of both myself and Dr. Cawly.

62
00:06:45,719 --> 00:06:47,344
Is that understood?

63
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:51,344
You act like insanity is catching.

64
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:57,989
You are hereby required to surrending
your firearms.

65
00:06:58,239 --> 00:07:01,558
Mr. McPherson, we are duly appointed
federal marshals.

66
00:07:01,559 --> 00:07:03,958
We are required to carry our
firearms with us at all times.

67
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:06,878
Executive order 319 of the Federal Code of
Penitentiaries states that:

68
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:08,958
when inside the penitentiary

69
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:13,734
the offices of that institution
have final authority.

70
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:21,634
Gentlemen, you will not get through
this gate with your firearms.

71
00:07:37,239 --> 00:07:40,638
Okay. Now that the official stuff is done,
come on boys.

72
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,989
What do you say we go find Dr. Cawley?

73
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:56,838
So when did she escape? This prisoner?

74
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:59,838
I'm afraid that Dr. Cawley will have to
fill you in on the situation.

75
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:00,614
Protocol.

76
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:03,118
Correctional officers at a mental institution.

77
00:08:03,119 --> 00:08:05,427
That's a weird sight,
if you don't mind me saying

78
00:08:05,428 --> 00:08:07,558
It's the only facility of it's kind in the U.S.
Even in the world.

79
00:08:07,559 --> 00:08:11,158
We take only the
most dangerous, damaged patients.

80
00:08:11,159 --> 00:08:14,958
Ones no other hospital can manage.
And it's all due to Dr. Cawley.

81
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:20,759
He's created something really unique here.
A hospital for people our society normally...

82
00:08:47,239 --> 00:08:48,639
ID's, gentlemen.

83
00:08:52,439 --> 00:08:53,939
Show your badges, gentlemen.

84
00:08:54,239 --> 00:08:56,438
Dr. Cawley's been consulted
numerous times

85
00:08:56,439 --> 00:08:59,839
- By Scotland Yard, MI5, the OSS...
- Why?

86
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:02,044
What do you mean?

87
00:09:04,319 --> 00:09:07,838
What do the intelligence agencies want
to consult a psychatrist about?

88
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,539
I guess you'll have to ask him.

89
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:21,638
- Marshal Daniels.
- Doctor.

90
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:22,839
Marshal Aule.

91
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:27,718
- Thank you deputy warden, that will be all.
- Yes, sir.

92
00:09:27,719 --> 00:09:29,369
Pleasure, gentlemen.

93
00:09:30,439 --> 00:09:32,158
He had a lot to say about you.

94
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:35,158
McPherson is a good man.
He believes in the work we do here.

95
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:37,518
And what would that be exactly?

96
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,958
A moral fusion between law and
order and clinical care.

97
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:44,909
Pardon me Doc...
a what between what and what?

98
00:09:50,439 --> 00:09:53,364
Those paintings are quite accurate.

99
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,238
It used to be that the kind of patients we
deal with here

100
00:09:56,239 --> 00:09:58,838
were shackled and left in their own filth.

101
00:09:58,839 --> 00:10:01,939
They were beaten. As if whipping
them bloody would drive the psychosis out.

102
00:10:02,239 --> 00:10:08,558
We drove screws into their brains. We submerged
them in icy water until they lost consciousness.

103
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:09,809
Or even drown.

104
00:10:10,439 --> 00:10:12,438
- And now?
- We treat them.

105
00:10:12,439 --> 00:10:14,539
Try to heal, try to cure.

106
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:19,318
And if this fails, at least we provide them
with a measure of comfort in their lives. Calm.

107
00:10:19,319 --> 00:10:20,369
These are...

108
00:10:21,239 --> 00:10:23,518
all violent offenders, right?

109
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,269
They've hurt people.

110
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:29,438
- Murdered them in some cases.
- In almost all cases. Yes.

111
00:10:29,439 --> 00:10:34,958
Then personally Doctor, I'd have to
say... screw their sense of calm.

112
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,718
It's my job to treat my patients not
their victims. I'm not here to judge.

113
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:42,019
- So this female prisoner...
- Patient.

114
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:45,509
Excuse me, patient.
One Rachel Solando,

115
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:49,238
- Escaped sometime in the last 24 hours.
- Last night.

116
00:10:49,239 --> 00:10:51,214
Between 10 and midnight.

117
00:10:51,239 --> 00:10:54,438
- Is she considered dangerous?
- You could say that.

118
00:10:54,439 --> 00:10:56,838
She killed all three of her children.

119
00:10:56,839 --> 00:10:59,838
She drowned them in the lake behind her house.

120
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:03,118
She took them out one by one and held their
heads under until they died.

121
00:11:03,119 --> 00:11:06,558
Then she brought them back inside and
arranged them around the kitchen table.

122
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:10,434
She ate a meal there
before a neighbor dropped by.

123
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:12,238
And what about the husband?

124
00:11:12,239 --> 00:11:16,638
He died. On the beaches of Normandy.
She is a war widow.

125
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:23,589
She starved herself when first she came here.
She insisted the children weren't dead.

126
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:35,358
- Sorry doctor. You wouldn't happen to have an aspirin? Do you?
- Prone to headaches marshal.

127
00:11:35,359 --> 00:11:37,158
Sometimes, but today...

128
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:40,238
- I'm a little more prone to seasickness.
- Ah, Dehydration...

129
00:11:40,239 --> 00:11:41,838
- You alright boss?
- Yes.

130
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:44,838
In that case you're quite right.
The simpler the better.

131
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:46,364
Thank you so much.

132
00:11:46,719 --> 00:11:50,569
Rachel still believes
her children are alive.

133
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:54,964
She also believes this place is her home
in the Berckshires.

134
00:11:55,239 --> 00:11:56,238
You're kidding me.

135
00:11:56,239 --> 00:11:59,278
She's never once in two years acknowledged
that she is in an institution.

136
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:00,638
She believes we're all...

137
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,038
deliveryman, milkman, postal workers.

138
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:07,478
To sustain the illusion that her children never died,
she's created an elaborate fictional structure.

139
00:12:07,479 --> 00:12:11,479
She gives us all parts to play in that fiction.

140
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:15,878
- So have you searched the grounds yet?
- The warden and his men scoured the island,

141
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:16,979
not a trace.

142
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:22,438
What's more disturbing is, we don't know
how she got out of her room.

143
00:12:22,439 --> 00:12:24,718
It was locked from the outside

144
00:12:24,719 --> 00:12:27,319
and the only window is barred.

145
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:33,639
It's as if she evaporated straight
through the walls.

146
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:41,638
Brought her right back here after
group therapy, locked her in

147
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:45,864
I came back for a midnight round
and she was gone.

148
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:55,038
Seriously doctor, how is it possible
that the truth never gets through to her?

149
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:57,958
I mean, she's in a
mental institution, right?

150
00:12:57,959 --> 00:12:59,958
Seems like something you'd
notice from time to time.

151
00:12:59,959 --> 00:13:03,438
- How many pairs of shoes are the patients given?
- Two pairs.

152
00:13:03,439 --> 00:13:05,573
Sanity is not a choice, marshal,

153
00:13:05,574 --> 00:13:08,238
You can't just choose to get over it.

154
00:13:08,239 --> 00:13:10,714
So... she left here barefoot?

155
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:16,077
Come on Doc, she couldn't get ten
yards in that terrain.

156
00:13:16,078 --> 00:13:16,853
Marshal?

157
00:13:33,838 --> 00:13:35,357


158
00:13:35,358 --> 00:13:37,437
Well this is definitely Rachel's
handwriting.

159
00:13:37,438 --> 00:13:41,877
- I have no idea what the "law of 4" is, though.
- It's not a psychiatric term?

160
00:13:41,878 --> 00:13:43,077
I'm afraid not.

161
00:13:43,078 --> 00:13:43,953
Who's 67?

162
00:13:45,718 --> 00:13:46,837
Fuck if I know!

163
00:13:46,838 --> 00:13:50,037
I'd have to say that's quite
close to my clinical conclusion.

164
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:52,437
So you think it's
random scribblings?

165
00:13:52,438 --> 00:13:56,237
Oh no, not at all. Rachel is smart.
Brilliant in fact.

166
00:13:56,238 --> 00:13:59,237
- This paper could be important.
- Excuse me Doctor, but...

167
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:02,763
- We're gonna have to hold onto this.
- Of course.

168
00:14:03,558 --> 00:14:06,437
And you say she had to come through here.

169
00:14:06,438 --> 00:14:10,317
After lights out, the orderlies play
cards in here.

170
00:14:10,318 --> 00:14:15,317
Last night there were 7 men sitting
at the base of those stairs playing stud poker.

171
00:14:15,318 --> 00:14:18,957
Yet somehow, Rachel managed
to slip past them.

172
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:19,358
Why?

173
00:14:20,838 --> 00:14:22,963
How? She turns invisible?

174
00:14:23,318 --> 00:14:26,517
Doctor, we're gonna need access to personnel files
of all the medical staff.

175
00:14:26,518 --> 00:14:28,357
The nurses, the guards, the orderlies.

176
00:14:28,358 --> 00:14:31,717
- Anyone who was working then.
- We'll take your request under consideration.

177
00:14:31,718 --> 00:14:34,318
This is not a request, Doctor.

178
00:14:34,638 --> 00:14:37,077
This is a federal facility
and a dangerous prisoner...

179
00:14:37,078 --> 00:14:39,028
- Patient.
- Patient...

180
00:14:39,358 --> 00:14:43,637
- has escaped now. You will comply...
- All I can say is that I will see what I can do.

181
00:14:43,638 --> 00:14:48,837
Doctor, we're gonna need to speak with the staff,
do you understand?

182
00:14:48,838 --> 00:14:51,957
I'll assemble them in the
common room after dinner.

183
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:59,108
If you have any further questions feel
free to join the deputy warden in the search.

184
00:15:08,238 --> 00:15:11,557
It's 11 miles to the nearest land
and the water is freezing.

185
00:15:11,558 --> 00:15:14,637
The current was strong last night.
The tide pushing in.

186
00:15:14,638 --> 00:15:22,037
She'd have drowned or been crushed on the
rocks, and her body would have washed back up onshore.

187
00:15:22,038 --> 00:15:25,157
What about those caves down there,
have you checked them?

188
00:15:25,158 --> 00:15:27,533
No way she could get there.

189
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:31,637
The base of those cliffs are covered
in poison ivy, live oak, sumac

190
00:15:31,638 --> 00:15:35,037
and a thousand plants with thorns
as big as my dick.

191
00:15:35,038 --> 00:15:39,338
You said it yourself marshal,
she's got no shoes.

192
00:15:43,158 --> 00:15:47,033
All right!
Let's check the other side!

193
00:15:50,718 --> 00:15:54,268
- What's that tower?
- It's an old lighthouse.

194
00:15:54,438 --> 00:15:57,713
The guards already searched inside it.

195
00:15:58,838 --> 00:16:03,317
- What's in there? More patients?
- Sewage treatment facility.

196
00:16:03,318 --> 00:16:05,193
It's getting dark soon.

197
00:16:05,638 --> 00:16:07,317
I'm calling this off for the night.

198
00:16:07,318 --> 00:16:08,693
Let's go, boys!

199
00:16:12,838 --> 00:16:14,957
- You were on watch on the landing, huh?
- Yeah.

200
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:19,637
Can't nobody get in or out of their room
in that corridor without me seeing.

201
00:16:19,638 --> 00:16:21,437
Okay, Rachel Solando,

202
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:25,638
who else does she have to pass
to get down here?

203
00:16:30,038 --> 00:16:30,363
Me.

204
00:16:31,638 --> 00:16:32,538
Glen Miga.

205
00:16:33,638 --> 00:16:37,717
- Sir, I didn't see nothing.
- And you were at your post all night?

206
00:16:37,718 --> 00:16:39,743
Yes. But I didn't see a thing.

207
00:16:41,438 --> 00:16:41,913
Glen.

208
00:16:44,518 --> 00:16:44,993
Glen.

209
00:16:48,438 --> 00:16:50,038
Tell me the truth.

210
00:16:54,518 --> 00:16:56,837
I maybe... went to the bathroom.

211
00:16:56,838 --> 00:17:02,317
- What? You breached protocol? Christ...
- I wasn't gone more than a minute.

212
00:17:02,318 --> 00:17:05,037
All right, let's back up here.
Let's all just back up.

213
00:17:05,038 --> 00:17:08,437
Miss Solando was put in
her room for lights out.

214
00:17:08,438 --> 00:17:11,437
Does anybody here know what she did
before that?

215
00:17:11,438 --> 00:17:12,063
Anyone?

216
00:17:13,838 --> 00:17:16,388
Come on. Anyone. Anyone. Anyone.

217
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:19,908
She was in a group therapy session.

218
00:17:20,638 --> 00:17:22,913
Huh. Did anything unusual occur?

219
00:17:23,038 --> 00:17:24,538
Define "unusual".

220
00:17:25,358 --> 00:17:28,437
- Excuse me.
- It's a mental institution, marshal.

221
00:17:28,438 --> 00:17:30,288
For criminally insane.

222
00:17:30,438 --> 00:17:33,713
"Usual", isn't a big part of our day.

223
00:17:34,238 --> 00:17:35,638
I will rephrase.

224
00:17:36,158 --> 00:17:39,837
Did anything happen last night
during group therapy, that was more...

225
00:17:39,838 --> 00:17:42,837
- let's say, more memorable than...
- Normal?

226
00:17:42,838 --> 00:17:43,538
Exactly!

227
00:17:44,358 --> 00:17:45,658
No. I'm sorry.

228
00:17:46,638 --> 00:17:50,717
Did Mrs. Solando say anything
during group therapy?

229
00:17:50,718 --> 00:17:53,393
She was worried about the rain.

230
00:17:53,718 --> 00:17:55,837
And she hated the food here.

231
00:17:55,838 --> 00:17:59,438
Complained constantly.
Last night included.

232
00:18:00,238 --> 00:18:03,637
So... you were there.
Was there a doctor present?

233
00:18:03,638 --> 00:18:05,763
Yes. Dr. Sheehan led the discussion.

234
00:18:07,238 --> 00:18:08,288
Dr. Sheehan?

235
00:18:09,638 --> 00:18:12,388
Yes. He was running the session.

236
00:18:13,238 --> 00:18:14,837
He's Rachels's "primary".

237
00:18:14,838 --> 00:18:18,988
The psychaiatrist who directly
oversees her care.

238
00:18:19,638 --> 00:18:21,957
We're gonna need to speak with Dr. Sheehan.

239
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:24,437
I'm afraid that won't be possible.

240
00:18:24,438 --> 00:18:27,677
He left on the ferry this morning.
His vacation was already planned.

241
00:18:27,678 --> 00:18:29,517
He'd putting it off too long.

242
00:18:29,518 --> 00:18:31,837
You're in a state of lockdown.

243
00:18:31,838 --> 00:18:34,357
A dangerous patient has escaped

244
00:18:34,358 --> 00:18:38,608
and you let her primary doctor
leave on vacation?

245
00:18:38,638 --> 00:18:40,788
Of course, he's a doctor.

246
00:18:45,038 --> 00:18:48,637
Do you have the phone number for
where he's gone?

247
00:18:48,638 --> 00:18:49,763
Hello? Hello?

248
00:18:52,438 --> 00:18:52,988
Hello?

249
00:18:54,158 --> 00:18:55,558
Is anybody there?

250
00:18:56,518 --> 00:18:58,837
I'm sorry sir, but its all down.
All the lines.

251
00:18:58,838 --> 00:19:00,437
The storm's hitting the
mainland like a hammer.

252
00:19:00,438 --> 00:19:05,037
If you get it working, come find me immediately.
The marshalls need to make an important call.

253
00:19:05,038 --> 00:19:05,863
Yes, sir.

254
00:19:12,238 --> 00:19:15,117
I'm afraid I have evening rounds in the wards,

255
00:19:15,118 --> 00:19:17,992
But I'll be having drinks and a cigar at
my house around 9

256
00:19:17,993 --> 00:19:19,837
If you'd care to drop by

257
00:19:19,838 --> 00:19:22,438
Good, we can talk then, right?

258
00:19:24,238 --> 00:19:26,863
We have been talking, marshal.

259
00:19:42,238 --> 00:19:45,477
Gotta say, I'm thinking I got
into the wrong line of public service.

260
00:19:45,478 --> 00:19:48,437
It is a little overwhelming.
it was constructed during the civil war

261
00:19:48,438 --> 00:19:52,738
The same time as the military fort
housing ward C.

262
00:19:59,638 --> 00:20:02,837
This is the original commander's quarters
and Uncle Sam got the bill.

263
00:20:02,838 --> 00:20:04,477
The commander was court-martialed.

264
00:20:04,478 --> 00:20:05,703
I can see why.

265
00:20:06,638 --> 00:20:09,313
Nice music. Who is that? Brahms?

266
00:20:09,838 --> 00:20:10,163
No.

267
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:20,058
It's Mahler.

268
00:20:20,838 --> 00:20:22,688
Quite right, marshal.

269
00:20:23,038 --> 00:20:28,138
Forgive me, gentlemen...
My colleague, Dr. Jeremiah Naehring.

270
00:20:34,238 --> 00:20:37,838
"Quartet for Piano and Strings
in A minor"

271
00:20:41,038 --> 00:20:43,957
- Your poison, gentlemen?
- Rye, if you've got it.

272
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:46,283
Soda and ice please, thanks.

273
00:20:46,518 --> 00:20:48,837
You don't indulge in alcohol?

274
00:20:48,838 --> 00:20:50,163
I am surprised.

275
00:20:51,438 --> 00:20:54,957
Isn't it common for men in your
profession to imbibe?

276
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:57,158
Common enough.
And yours?

277
00:20:59,638 --> 00:21:03,557
- I'm sorry?
- Your profession, doctor. Psychiatry...

278
00:21:03,558 --> 00:21:07,237
I've always heard it was overrun
with boozers and drunks.

279
00:21:07,238 --> 00:21:09,188
Not that I've noticed.

280
00:21:10,638 --> 00:21:13,638
What's that? Iced tea in your glass there?

281
00:21:13,673 --> 00:21:15,213
Excellent marshal.

282
00:21:15,638 --> 00:21:18,317
You have outstanding defense mechanisms.

283
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:21,793
You must be quite adept at interrogations, hmm?

284
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:32,863
Men like you... are my specialty.
You know?

285
00:21:33,838 --> 00:21:35,238
Men of violence.

286
00:21:36,038 --> 00:21:38,517
That's a hell of an assumption to make...

287
00:21:38,518 --> 00:21:43,517
No assumption. Not at all. You misunderstand
me, I said you are men of violence

288
00:21:43,518 --> 00:21:47,717
I'm not accusing you of being violent men.
That's quite different.

289
00:21:47,718 --> 00:21:50,268
Please, please, edify us, doctor.

290
00:21:52,718 --> 00:21:54,768
You both served overseas.

291
00:21:54,958 --> 00:21:59,637
Not much of a stretch, Doc. For all you know,
we were both paper pushers over there

292
00:21:59,638 --> 00:22:01,163
No, you were not.

293
00:22:16,438 --> 00:22:22,237
Since the schoolyard, neither of
you has ever walked away from a physical conflict.

294
00:22:22,238 --> 00:22:27,437
Not because you enjoy it, but because retreat
wasn't something you considered an option.

295
00:22:27,438 --> 00:22:29,588
We weren't raised to run, Doc.

296
00:22:30,238 --> 00:22:31,713
Ah, yes... Raised.

297
00:22:34,238 --> 00:22:36,637
and who raised you, marshal?

298
00:22:36,638 --> 00:22:36,963
Me?

299
00:22:39,238 --> 00:22:39,863
Wolves.

300
00:22:43,958 --> 00:22:46,758
Very impressive defense mechanisms.

301
00:23:43,238 --> 00:23:45,988
Do you believe in God, marshal?

302
00:23:50,838 --> 00:23:52,363
I'm quite serious.

303
00:23:54,718 --> 00:23:56,043
That's rubbish.

304
00:23:58,238 --> 00:24:01,913
Have you ever seen... a death camp, doctor?

305
00:24:02,758 --> 00:24:07,058
[In German]
I have, I was there, for
the liberation of Dakau.

306
00:24:11,438 --> 00:24:14,988
Your English is very good, almost flawless.

307
00:24:15,638 --> 00:24:20,957
His English is very good.
You hit the consonants a tad hard, though.

308
00:24:20,958 --> 00:24:22,208
You're German?

309
00:24:23,438 --> 00:24:30,588
- Is legal immigration a crime, marshal?
- Oh I don't know doctor, you to tell us.

310
00:24:30,638 --> 00:24:35,517
Now listen, we're gonne need those files on Sheehan
and the rest of staff as well.

311
00:24:35,518 --> 00:24:38,357
No personnel files will be released for you.
Period.

312
00:24:38,358 --> 00:24:41,477
- We're gonna need those files.
- Out of the question.

313
00:24:41,478 --> 00:24:44,357
Bullshit, out of the question!
Bullshit!

314
00:24:44,358 --> 00:24:46,837
Who the hell is in charge here anyway, huh?

315
00:24:46,838 --> 00:24:50,637
Dr. Naehring acts as liaison to
our board of overseers.

316
00:24:50,638 --> 00:24:52,717
He relayed your request and it's been refused.

317
00:24:52,718 --> 00:24:55,957
Refused? They don't have the authority
to refuse. And neither do you, sir.

318
00:24:55,958 --> 00:24:59,557
Marshal, continue your investigation
and we will do all we can to help.

319
00:24:59,558 --> 00:25:01,437
This investigation is over.

320
00:25:01,438 --> 00:25:03,817
We're gonna file our reports
and hand it over to...

321
00:25:03,818 --> 00:25:06,537
- Hoover's boys.
- Hoover's boys, that's right.

322
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:08,537
We'll be taking the ferry back in the morning.

323
00:25:08,538 --> 00:25:09,788
Come on, Chuck.

324
00:25:18,338 --> 00:25:19,313
Nice night.

325
00:25:25,538 --> 00:25:28,938
You'll be bunking in the orderlies quarter.

326
00:25:39,658 --> 00:25:43,108
Hey boss?... We really packing it in?

327
00:25:44,018 --> 00:25:44,418
Why?

328
00:25:45,938 --> 00:25:50,337
I guess, I dunno, I just...
never really quit anything before.

329
00:25:50,338 --> 00:25:53,816
We haven't heard the truth once yet, Chuck.

330
00:25:53,817 --> 00:25:59,616
Listen. Rachel Solando did not slip out of
a locked cell barefoot without any help.

331
00:25:59,617 --> 00:26:01,616
I think she had alot of help.

332
00:26:01,617 --> 00:26:04,136
Maybe Cawley's sitting up in his mansion
right now,

333
00:26:04,137 --> 00:26:06,637
rethinking his whole attitude.

334
00:26:07,737 --> 00:26:11,456
- Maybe in the morning...
- You're bluffing?

335
00:26:11,457 --> 00:26:13,182
I didn't say that.

336
00:26:31,137 --> 00:26:34,216
I found a whole stack of these, Teddy.

337
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:37,016
Jesus, are you ever sober anymore?

338
00:26:37,017 --> 00:26:40,092
I killed alot of people in the war.

339
00:26:41,657 --> 00:26:43,607
Is that why you drink?

340
00:26:46,217 --> 00:26:47,392
Are you real?

341
00:26:48,537 --> 00:26:48,862
No.

342
00:26:53,817 --> 00:26:55,342
She's still here.

343
00:26:55,937 --> 00:26:56,337
Who?

344
00:26:58,137 --> 00:26:58,762
Rachel?

345
00:27:01,137 --> 00:27:02,462
She never left.

346
00:27:15,537 --> 00:27:19,837
Remember when we stayed in the cabin
in the summer, Teddy?

347
00:27:19,937 --> 00:27:21,387
We were so happy.

348
00:27:23,737 --> 00:27:24,762
She's here.

349
00:27:25,337 --> 00:27:26,712
You can't leave.

350
00:27:39,337 --> 00:27:41,137
I'm not gonna leave.

351
00:27:42,657 --> 00:27:44,382
I love you so much.

352
00:27:48,737 --> 00:27:52,237
- I'm just bones in a box, Teddy.
- No.

353
00:27:53,537 --> 00:27:53,987
I am.

354
00:27:57,937 --> 00:27:59,737
You have to wake up.

355
00:28:01,057 --> 00:28:02,132
I won't go.

356
00:28:03,537 --> 00:28:04,637
You're here.

357
00:28:06,937 --> 00:28:07,737
I'm not.

358
00:28:09,217 --> 00:28:11,167
You have to face that.

359
00:28:13,737 --> 00:28:14,687
But she is.

360
00:28:17,057 --> 00:28:18,207
And so is he.

361
00:28:20,737 --> 00:28:21,137
Who?

362
00:28:23,937 --> 00:28:24,637
Laeddis.

363
00:28:29,937 --> 00:28:31,162
I have to go.

364
00:28:34,857 --> 00:28:36,532
No! Please...just let me hold you.

365
00:28:37,217 --> 00:28:39,656
- Just a little bit longer.
- Oh, Teddy...

366
00:28:39,657 --> 00:28:40,607
You have to let me go.

367
00:28:42,937 --> 00:28:43,887
I can't.

368
00:29:15,217 --> 00:29:18,417
Ain't gonna be no ferry in this shit.

369
00:29:21,457 --> 00:29:22,082
Doctor.

370
00:29:23,137 --> 00:29:24,412
Doctor, doctor.

371
00:29:25,217 --> 00:29:28,216
We need to interview the patients who
were in Rachel's group therapy session.

372
00:29:28,217 --> 00:29:30,016
I thought your investigation was finished?

373
00:29:30,017 --> 00:29:32,936
It's not like we can take the ferry.

374
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:37,336
Now was Rachel receiving any
other treatment for her illnesses?

375
00:29:37,337 --> 00:29:40,656
Do you know the state of the
mental health field these days, gentlemen?

376
00:29:40,657 --> 00:29:42,682
No. Not a clue doctor.

377
00:29:42,937 --> 00:29:43,337
War.

378
00:29:44,217 --> 00:29:47,016
The old school believes in
surgical intervention.

379
00:29:47,017 --> 00:29:52,042
Psychosurgery.
Procedures like the trans-orbital lobotomy.

380
00:29:52,737 --> 00:29:58,016
Some say the patients become reasonable, docile.
Others say they become zombies.

381
00:29:58,017 --> 00:30:00,336
- And the new school?
- Psycho pharmacology.

382
00:30:00,337 --> 00:30:02,456
A new drug has just been approved.
Authority.
 
383
00:30:02,457 --> 00:30:04,091
Which relaxes psychotic patients.

384
00:30:04,092 --> 00:30:05,536
You could say it tames them.

385
00:30:05,537 --> 00:30:08,136
- And which school are you in, Doc?
- Me?

386
00:30:08,137 --> 00:30:11,376
I have this radical idea that if you treat a
patient with respect,

387
00:30:11,377 --> 00:30:12,902
listen to him,

388
00:30:13,337 --> 00:30:17,387
try and understand.
you just might reach him.

389
00:30:21,457 --> 00:30:23,936
- These patients?
- Even these.

390
00:30:23,937 --> 00:30:26,456
What should be a last resort is 
becoming a first response.

391
00:30:26,457 --> 00:30:30,136
Give them a pill, put them in a corner,
and it all goes away.

392
00:30:30,137 --> 00:30:32,656
Rachel Solando was on a combination of drugs

393
00:30:32,657 --> 00:30:37,336
meant to keep her from becoming violent,
but it was only intermittently effective.

394
00:30:37,337 --> 00:30:42,136
The greatest obstacle to her recovery was
her refusal to face what she had done.

395
00:30:42,137 --> 00:30:42,687
"Was."

396
00:30:44,137 --> 00:30:50,487
Is there a reason you keep referring to
your patient in the past tense, doctor?

397
00:30:51,037 --> 00:30:52,962
Look outside, marshal.

398
00:30:53,837 --> 00:30:55,362
Why do you think?

399
00:31:01,117 --> 00:31:04,876
Next up is Peter Breen. Assaulted
his father's nurse with a broken glass.

400
00:31:04,877 --> 00:31:08,436
Nurse survived, but
her face permaanently disfigured.

401
00:31:08,437 --> 00:31:09,662
I can't wait.

402
00:31:09,957 --> 00:31:13,032
She'd smiles at me.
She was so sweet.

403
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:17,836
But... I could see it in her eyes.
She liked to be naked.

404
00:31:17,837 --> 00:31:19,437
To suck cock.

405
00:31:20,557 --> 00:31:22,307
Okay, Mr. Breen.

406
00:31:22,717 --> 00:31:26,156
And then she asked me if she can have
a glass of water?

407
00:31:26,157 --> 00:31:29,716
Alone in the kitchen?
Like that's no big deal?

408
00:31:29,717 --> 00:31:32,956
- Why was that a big deal?
- It was obvious.

409
00:31:32,957 --> 00:31:38,207
She wanted me to pull out my thing so she
could laugh at it.

410
00:31:38,717 --> 00:31:39,542
Mr. Breen,

411
00:31:41,957 --> 00:31:45,407
we need to ask you some questions, okay?

412
00:31:46,637 --> 00:31:49,012
When I cut her she screamed

413
00:31:50,517 --> 00:31:51,067
But...

414
00:31:52,237 --> 00:31:53,487
She scared me.

415
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:55,787
What did she expect?

416
00:31:56,237 --> 00:31:57,237
Interesting.

417
00:31:58,437 --> 00:32:01,836
But we are here to talk
Rachel Solando, okay?

418
00:32:01,837 --> 00:32:03,262
Rachel Solando...

419
00:32:03,957 --> 00:32:06,116
Did you know she had drowned her own kids?

420
00:32:06,117 --> 00:32:07,867
She drowned her kids!

421
00:32:08,317 --> 00:32:11,436
This is a sick fucking world
we live in. I'll tell you that...

422
00:32:11,437 --> 00:32:12,956
You know what? They should be gassed.

423
00:32:12,957 --> 00:32:15,932
All of them... the retards, the killers

424
00:32:16,437 --> 00:32:20,462
the niggers. You kill your own kid?
Gas the bitch!

425
00:32:22,837 --> 00:32:24,462
Would you... stop that?

426
00:32:26,237 --> 00:32:28,636
- A nurse?
- Please. Stop that.

427
00:32:28,637 --> 00:32:31,587
A nurse maybe. Maybe she had kids, huh?

428
00:32:32,957 --> 00:32:34,007
A husband...

429
00:32:35,957 --> 00:32:38,132
Just trying to make ends meet,

430
00:32:39,437 --> 00:32:41,537
to lead a normal life...

431
00:32:42,437 --> 00:32:44,437
And it says in your file that uh...

432
00:32:44,957 --> 00:32:47,882
You tore her face off, didn't you?

433
00:32:49,637 --> 00:32:54,337
Congratulations, no more normal
for her, not ever again, no.

434
00:32:55,157 --> 00:32:58,232
Do you know what she was afraid of?

435
00:33:00,237 --> 00:33:00,637
You.

436
00:33:01,237 --> 00:33:03,637
Could you stop that, please?!

437
00:33:05,117 --> 00:33:06,017
Stop that!

438
00:33:07,437 --> 00:33:08,787
Please... stop!

439
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:13,187
You know a patient by the name of Andrew Laeddis?

440
00:33:14,437 --> 00:33:16,087
- I want to go back.
- Take him!

441
00:33:32,637 --> 00:33:34,516
I'll never get out of here.

442
00:33:34,517 --> 00:33:36,442
I'm not sure that I should.

443
00:33:37,837 --> 00:33:39,516
Excuse me for saying this,

444
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:41,517
- Miss Kearns...
- Misses.

445
00:33:41,552 --> 00:33:42,567
Mrs. Kearns.

446
00:33:44,437 --> 00:33:45,762
But you seem...

447
00:33:46,437 --> 00:33:47,787
quite normal,...

448
00:33:48,157 --> 00:33:50,516
I mean in comparison
with the other patients here.

449
00:33:50,517 --> 00:33:54,817
Well, I have my dark days
I suppose everybody does.

450
00:33:55,157 --> 00:34:00,556
The difference is that most people don't kill
their husbands with an axe.

451
00:34:00,557 --> 00:34:04,116
Although personally I think if a
man beats you and fucks

452
00:34:04,117 --> 00:34:08,317
half the women he sees
and no one will help you,

453
00:34:08,637 --> 00:34:13,556
axing him isn't the least understandable
thing you can do.

454
00:34:13,557 --> 00:34:16,007
Maybe you shouldn't get out.

455
00:34:16,557 --> 00:34:18,716
And what would I do if I did?

456
00:34:18,717 --> 00:34:22,156
I don't know the world anymore.
They say there are

457
00:34:22,157 --> 00:34:25,236
bombs that can reduce whole
cities to ash

458
00:34:25,237 --> 00:34:28,236
And what do they call "televisions"...

459
00:34:28,237 --> 00:34:31,187
voices and faces coming from a box.

460
00:34:31,517 --> 00:34:33,917
I hear enough voices already

461
00:34:34,437 --> 00:34:37,387
What can you tell us about Rachel?

462
00:34:39,437 --> 00:34:42,462
Um. Not much, she... she keeps to herself.

463
00:34:43,837 --> 00:34:46,587
She believed her kids were alive.

464
00:34:46,717 --> 00:34:52,036
She thought she was still living
in the Berkshire and we were all neighbours

465
00:34:52,037 --> 00:34:54,787
- The milkman, postmen...
- Deliveryman,

466
00:34:56,357 --> 00:34:58,516
And Dr. Sheehan was there that night?

467
00:34:58,517 --> 00:34:58,917
Yes. Um.

468
00:35:00,557 --> 00:35:02,457
He talked about anger.

469
00:35:04,637 --> 00:35:06,387
Tell me about him...

470
00:35:06,957 --> 00:35:08,332
What's he like?

471
00:35:08,957 --> 00:35:10,057
I think he's uh...

472
00:35:13,957 --> 00:35:14,857
Okay... nice.

473
00:35:16,957 --> 00:35:20,957
Not hard on the eyes
as my mother would say.

474
00:35:21,717 --> 00:35:24,242
Did he ever make a pass at you?

475
00:35:24,437 --> 00:35:24,762
No.

476
00:35:26,437 --> 00:35:30,662
No, Dr. Sheehan is a good
doctor, he would never...

477
00:35:32,637 --> 00:35:34,636
Could I have a glass of water, please?

478
00:35:34,637 --> 00:35:35,612
No problem.

479
00:35:50,237 --> 00:35:51,937
Thank you, marshal.

480
00:35:56,437 --> 00:36:00,112
I have just one more question for you
Mrs. Kearns.

481
00:36:03,117 --> 00:36:07,367
Did you ever meet a patient
named Andrew Laeddis?

482
00:36:08,637 --> 00:36:08,962
No.

483
00:36:11,037 --> 00:36:12,712
Never heard of him.

484
00:36:18,557 --> 00:36:19,882
She was coached.

485
00:36:20,717 --> 00:36:23,276
She used practically the same words as
Cawley and the nurse.

486
00:36:23,277 --> 00:36:29,627
- It's like she'd been told exactly what to say.
- Who is Andrew Laeddis?

487
00:36:30,437 --> 00:36:35,512
You asked every one of those patients
back there about him. Who is he?

488
00:36:38,157 --> 00:36:41,836
What the hell, boss, I'm your partner
for the Christ sake!

489
00:36:41,837 --> 00:36:43,512
We just met, Chuck.

490
00:36:44,037 --> 00:36:46,036
Been on the beat a long time.

491
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:49,636
You got a duty, got a career
and what I'm doing,

492
00:36:49,637 --> 00:36:51,737
not exactly by the book.

493
00:36:53,117 --> 00:37:00,667
I don't give a damn about "by the book", boss
I just to know what the hell is going on.

494
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:05,662
When this case came over the wires,

495
00:37:06,117 --> 00:37:10,917
- I requested it specifically. Do you understand?
- Why?

496
00:37:12,317 --> 00:37:13,592
Andrew Laeddis,

497
00:37:14,837 --> 00:37:20,436
was the maintenance man in the apartment
building where my wife and I lived.

498
00:37:20,437 --> 00:37:20,912
Okay.

499
00:37:23,237 --> 00:37:25,187
He was also a firebug.

500
00:37:27,837 --> 00:37:30,312
Andrew Laeddis lit the match,

501
00:37:32,957 --> 00:37:36,482
that caused the fire that killed my wife.

502
00:37:43,517 --> 00:37:44,342
Let 'em out!

503
00:37:47,637 --> 00:37:49,636
What happened to Laeddis?

504
00:37:49,637 --> 00:37:53,337
Got away with it.
Laeddis got away with it and disappeared.

505
00:37:53,957 --> 00:37:56,156
About a year ago, I opened up the
newspaper and there he is.

506
00:37:56,157 --> 00:37:58,236
He's an ugly looking son of a bitch.

507
00:37:58,237 --> 00:38:00,756
He had a new scar from his right temple
down to his left lip.

508
00:38:00,757 --> 00:38:04,036
Eyes different colors.
Not the type of face you forget.

509
00:38:04,037 --> 00:38:07,116
He'd burned down a schoolhouse. Killed 2 people.

510
00:38:07,117 --> 00:38:08,956
He said voices told him to do it.

511
00:38:08,957 --> 00:38:11,556
First he was sent to prison
and then he was transferred here.

512
00:38:11,557 --> 00:38:13,635
- Then what?
- Then, nothing.

513
00:38:13,636 --> 00:38:17,435
He vanished like he never existed.
No record whatsoever.

514
00:38:17,436 --> 00:38:19,990
I'm sure he's not in ward B
that leaves ward C.

515
00:38:19,991 --> 00:38:21,155
Or he could be dead.

516
00:38:21,156 --> 00:38:26,306
So could Rachel Solando for that matter.
Lot of places to hide a body here.

517
00:38:27,036 --> 00:38:30,561
Only one place
no one really knows.

518
00:38:40,836 --> 00:38:44,715
That patient, Bridget Kearne,
when she sent me for water,

519
00:38:44,716 --> 00:38:47,635
she said something to you back there, didn't she?

520
00:38:47,636 --> 00:38:47,961
No.

521
00:38:50,716 --> 00:38:51,891
Come on boss!

522
00:38:55,436 --> 00:38:56,611
She wrote it.

523
00:39:00,236 --> 00:39:00,861


524
00:39:11,636 --> 00:39:12,111
Boss!

525
00:39:13,316 --> 00:39:16,875
We gotta get indoors. It's turning
into fucking Kansas out here...

526
00:39:16,876 --> 00:39:19,176
- All right. 
- Now. Let's go!

527
00:39:21,636 --> 00:39:22,536
Watch out!

528
00:39:25,236 --> 00:39:25,786
Jesus!

529
00:39:28,236 --> 00:39:30,311
Come on! Let's go back!

530
00:39:47,156 --> 00:39:49,131
Jesus Christ!
Damn it!

531
00:39:59,756 --> 00:40:03,706
- Are you okay boss?
- Yes. That's all right.

532
00:40:09,236 --> 00:40:11,955
So... if Laeddis is here...

533
00:40:11,956 --> 00:40:14,606
What are you going to do boss?

534
00:40:16,236 --> 00:40:18,811
I'm not here to kill Leaddis.

535
00:40:26,036 --> 00:40:29,511
If it was my wife
I'd kill him twice.

536
00:40:39,036 --> 00:40:44,786
When we got through the gates of Dakau,
the SS guards surrendered.

537
00:40:51,636 --> 00:40:56,611
The commandante tried to kill himself
before we got there...

538
00:40:58,236 --> 00:40:59,761
but he botched it.

539
00:41:00,956 --> 00:41:03,031
Took him an hour to die.

540
00:41:07,436 --> 00:41:11,661
When I went outside,
I saw all the bodies on the ground.

541
00:41:15,436 --> 00:41:16,961
Too many to count.

542
00:41:42,836 --> 00:41:44,586
Too many to imagine.

543
00:41:47,236 --> 00:41:47,911
So yeah

544
00:41:50,836 --> 00:41:56,036
The guards surrendered, we took
their guns, we lined them up...

545
00:42:36,956 --> 00:42:38,481
It wasn't warfare,

546
00:42:40,836 --> 00:42:42,086
it was murder. 

547
00:42:46,356 --> 00:42:48,231
Yeah I've had enough of killing.

548
00:42:51,036 --> 00:42:53,161
That's not why I'm here.

549
00:42:53,836 --> 00:42:55,986
So what is this all about?

550
00:42:58,036 --> 00:42:59,961
After Laeddis vanished,

551
00:43:00,956 --> 00:43:04,731
I started doing some checking
on Ashecliffe.

552
00:43:04,956 --> 00:43:09,835
A lot of people knew about this place, but no
one wants to talk...

553
00:43:09,836 --> 00:43:12,586
You know? It's like they're scared of something

554
00:43:13,556 --> 00:43:17,235
You know this place is funded by
a special grant

555
00:43:17,236 --> 00:43:20,315
from the House of
Unamerican Activities Committee.

556
00:43:20,316 --> 00:43:26,235
HUAC. And how exactly are we fighting
the Commies from an island in Boston Harbor?

557
00:43:26,236 --> 00:43:29,361
By conducting experiments on the mind.

558
00:43:30,036 --> 00:43:31,515
At least that's my guess.

559
00:43:31,516 --> 00:43:33,435
And you think thats going on in here?

560
00:43:33,436 --> 00:43:35,635
Like I said, no one would talk, right?

561
00:43:35,636 --> 00:43:38,355
Until I found someone
who used to be a patient here.

562
00:43:38,356 --> 00:43:40,155
Guy's name is George Noyce.

563
00:43:40,156 --> 00:43:42,581
Nice college kid.
Socialist.

564
00:43:42,716 --> 00:43:46,235
He gets offered some money for some
psych study. Guess what they were testing?

565
00:43:46,236 --> 00:43:49,435
- Drug tests.
- So he starts seeing dragons everywhere.

566
00:43:49,436 --> 00:43:53,235
Almost beats his proffesor to death
Ends up here in Ashecliffe.

567
00:43:53,236 --> 00:43:53,911
Ward C.

568
00:43:55,156 --> 00:43:58,435
They released him after 1 year, right?
What does he do?

569
00:43:58,436 --> 00:44:03,755
Two weeks on the mainland he walks into
a bar and stabs three men to death.

570
00:44:03,756 --> 00:44:06,755
His lawyer pleads insanity,
but Noyce...

571
00:44:06,756 --> 00:44:08,835
stands up in the courtroom and

572
00:44:08,836 --> 00:44:10,635
he begs the judge,
for the electric chair.

573
00:44:10,636 --> 00:44:13,435
Anywhere but not a
mental hospital.

574
00:44:13,436 --> 00:44:16,961
Judge gives him life in the Dedham prison.

575
00:44:17,036 --> 00:44:21,035
- And you found him?
- Yes, I found him.

576
00:44:21,036 --> 00:44:22,111
He's a mess

577
00:44:23,156 --> 00:44:26,835
But it is pretty clear from what he tells me,

578
00:44:26,836 --> 00:44:29,715
they're experimenting on people here.

579
00:44:29,716 --> 00:44:31,516
I don't know, boss.

580
00:44:32,236 --> 00:44:35,715
- How do you believe a crazy guy?
- That's the beauty of it.

581
00:44:35,716 --> 00:44:40,235
Crazy people are a perfect subject.
They talk, but nobody listens.

582
00:44:40,236 --> 00:44:41,836
I stood in Dakau.

583
00:44:41,956 --> 00:44:46,715
We saw what human beings are capable
of doing to each other, right?

584
00:44:46,716 --> 00:44:49,115
For Christ sake we fought a goddamn war

585
00:44:49,116 --> 00:44:51,475
to stop them,
and now find out it may be happening here?

586
00:44:51,476 --> 00:44:53,001
On our soil?
No.

587
00:44:55,236 --> 00:44:58,115
So what are you really here to do, Teddy?

588
00:44:58,116 --> 00:45:00,466
I'm gonna get the proof,

589
00:45:00,556 --> 00:45:04,635
I'm gonna go back, and blow
the lid off this place.

590
00:45:04,636 --> 00:45:05,511
That's it.

591
00:45:06,556 --> 00:45:07,806
Wait a minute.

592
00:45:09,036 --> 00:45:11,635
You started asking around about Ashecliffe.

593
00:45:11,636 --> 00:45:16,715
Waiting for a chance to get out here
then suddenly they need a US marshal?

594
00:45:16,716 --> 00:45:19,475
I got lucky. There was a patient escape,
it was the perfect excuse.

595
00:45:19,476 --> 00:45:22,435
No, no, no boss.
Luck doesn't work that way.

596
00:45:22,436 --> 00:45:26,955
The world doesn't work that way. They got an
electrified fence around a septic facility.

597
00:45:26,956 --> 00:45:29,956
Ward C is inside a Civil War fort?

598
00:45:30,436 --> 00:45:34,435
A chief of staff with ties to the OSS
Funding from HUAC?

599
00:45:34,436 --> 00:45:38,435
Jesus Christ! Everything about this place
stinks of "government ops".

600
00:45:38,436 --> 00:45:40,435
- What If they wanted you here?
- Bullshit.

601
00:45:40,436 --> 00:45:42,235
- You were asking questions.
- Bullshit.

602
00:45:42,236 --> 00:45:47,355
Bullshit? We came in for Rachel Solando? Where is
one shred of evidence that she even existed?

603
00:45:47,356 --> 00:45:49,715
There's no way they could of known I'd be
assigned to this case. No way...

604
00:45:49,716 --> 00:45:52,635
While you were looking into them,
they were looking into you.

605
00:45:52,636 --> 00:45:55,190
All they need to do
is fake an escape to get you here.

606
00:45:55,191 --> 00:45:59,766
And now they have you.
They have us both, here, now.

607
00:46:01,756 --> 00:46:03,806
Marshal, are you out here?

608
00:46:04,116 --> 00:46:06,955
This is deputy warden McPherson.

609
00:46:06,956 --> 00:46:07,806
Marshal!

610
00:46:08,116 --> 00:46:10,315
How about that? They found us huh.

611
00:46:10,316 --> 00:46:13,835
It's an island, boss. They're always gonna find us.

612
00:46:13,836 --> 00:46:16,286
I know you are in there...

613
00:46:16,716 --> 00:46:19,555
We're getting off of this Goddamned island.
You and me.

614
00:46:19,556 --> 00:46:20,306
Come on!

615
00:46:24,316 --> 00:46:25,791
- Come on!
- Go!

616
00:46:35,516 --> 00:46:39,155
Get dried off.
Dr. Cawley wants to talk to you. Now!

617
00:46:39,156 --> 00:46:44,631
And hurry up, this thing is turning
into a goddamn hurricane!

618
00:46:47,436 --> 00:46:49,715
I dropped those suits off to be cleaned.

619
00:46:49,716 --> 00:46:51,635
It should be ready by tomorrow.

620
00:46:51,636 --> 00:46:54,411
That is if we don't all wash away first.

621
00:46:54,436 --> 00:46:59,035
Speaking of which, I'm afraid your smokes were
pretty much done for.

622
00:46:59,036 --> 00:46:59,511
So...

623
00:47:01,956 --> 00:47:03,955
This is our only choice, huh?

624
00:47:03,956 --> 00:47:07,035
Got something really nice in prison already
if that don't work for you...

625
00:47:07,036 --> 00:47:10,611
Now that you mention it, these are just fine.

626
00:47:10,636 --> 00:47:13,675
That's why I must repeat my insistence
that all ward C patients

627
00:47:13,676 --> 00:47:15,835
be placed in manual restraints.

628
00:47:15,836 --> 00:47:19,635
If the facility floods, they'll drown.
You know that.

629
00:47:19,636 --> 00:47:21,675
- That would take a lot of flooding.
- We are on an island,

630
00:47:21,676 --> 00:47:23,435
in the middle of the ocean,
during a hurricane.

631
00:47:23,436 --> 00:47:25,875
A lot of flooding seems like a
distinct possibility.

632
00:47:25,876 --> 00:47:28,475
It's a gamble, Steven.
say the power fails

633
00:47:28,476 --> 00:47:29,635
There's a backup generator.

634
00:47:29,636 --> 00:47:33,361
And if that goes? The cell doors
will open.

635
00:47:33,636 --> 00:47:35,511
Where are they going to go?
Hmm?

636
00:47:36,156 --> 00:47:39,035
They can't just hop a ferry, scoot over
to the mainland and wreak havoc.

637
00:47:39,036 --> 00:47:43,635
You're quite right. They're far more likely
to wreak havoc right here on us.

638
00:47:43,636 --> 00:47:47,155
If they're manacled to the floor, they'll die.

639
00:47:47,156 --> 00:47:48,556
That's 24 human beings.

640
00:47:49,236 --> 00:47:51,035
You can't live with that, can you?

641
00:47:51,036 --> 00:47:52,835
Frankly, if it were up to me,

642
00:47:52,836 --> 00:47:56,235
I'd put all 42 in ward A and B in
manual restraints as well.

643
00:47:56,236 --> 00:47:57,986
Excuse me
Excuse me

644
00:47:58,236 --> 00:48:01,590
- Marshal.
- I'm sorry doctor, I just have one quick question.

645
00:48:01,591 --> 00:48:02,835
Yes, I will be with you in a moment.

646
00:48:02,836 --> 00:48:05,635
We spoke this morning
about Rachel Solando's note

647
00:48:05,636 --> 00:48:07,435
The law of 4, I loved that.

648
00:48:07,436 --> 00:48:11,555
You said you had no idea what
that second line could refer to. Correct?

649
00:48:11,556 --> 00:48:12,431
Who is 67?

650
00:48:13,716 --> 00:48:17,435
Yes, I'm afraid I still don't.
None of us do.

651
00:48:17,436 --> 00:48:19,336
Uh huh. Nothing comes to mind.

652
00:48:21,156 --> 00:48:21,856
Nothing?

653
00:48:26,156 --> 00:48:28,675
Because I believe I just heard
you say that there are

654
00:48:28,676 --> 00:48:30,626
24 patients in ward C.

655
00:48:31,196 --> 00:48:33,635
And 42 of patients, in wards A and B

656
00:48:33,636 --> 00:48:38,035
Which means there is a total of what?
66 patients here in this facility.

657
00:48:38,036 --> 00:48:39,786
That is correct, yes.

658
00:48:42,716 --> 00:48:45,435
Then it seems that
Rachel Solando was suggesting

659
00:48:45,436 --> 00:48:48,036
you have a 67th patient, doctor

660
00:48:50,156 --> 00:48:53,115
- But I'm afraid we don't.
- This Is ridiculous.

661
00:48:53,116 --> 00:48:56,635
- What are you doing here?
- We are doing our goddamn job.

662
00:48:56,636 --> 00:48:59,955
Didn't McPherson tell you the good news?

663
00:48:59,956 --> 00:49:02,315
No, what's the good news, doctor?

664
00:49:02,316 --> 00:49:04,216
Rachel has been found.

665
00:49:05,116 --> 00:49:06,066
She's here.

666
00:49:07,556 --> 00:49:08,806
Safe and sound.

667
00:49:20,036 --> 00:49:22,461
There is not a mark on her.

668
00:49:25,516 --> 00:49:27,116
Who are these men?

669
00:49:30,036 --> 00:49:32,035
Why are they in my house?

670
00:49:32,036 --> 00:49:34,036
Police officers, Rachel.

671
00:49:34,436 --> 00:49:36,911
They... have a few questions.

672
00:49:39,036 --> 00:49:39,636
Ma'am.

673
00:49:43,956 --> 00:49:47,155
There's been a sighting of a known
Communist

674
00:49:47,156 --> 00:49:51,081
subversive in this area
passing out literature

675
00:49:51,956 --> 00:49:52,431
Here?

676
00:49:55,236 --> 00:49:57,011
In this neighborhood?

677
00:49:57,116 --> 00:49:58,841
Yes, I'm afraid so.

678
00:50:00,036 --> 00:50:03,635
If you can tell us what you did
yesterday, where you were,

679
00:50:03,636 --> 00:50:06,436
it would really help us narrow our search.

680
00:50:06,956 --> 00:50:07,506
Yes...

681
00:50:10,716 --> 00:50:11,616
Well, I...umm

682
00:50:15,156 --> 00:50:18,831
I made breakfast for Jim
and the children,

683
00:50:19,236 --> 00:50:20,411
and then I...

684
00:50:22,636 --> 00:50:25,636
I packed Jim's lunch
and he left.

685
00:50:28,156 --> 00:50:31,531
Then I sent the children off to school.

686
00:50:35,035 --> 00:50:36,010
And then...

687
00:50:42,435 --> 00:50:46,135
I decided to take a long swim in the lake.

688
00:50:52,035 --> 00:50:52,785
I see...

689
00:50:56,955 --> 00:50:58,280
And after that?

690
00:51:06,035 --> 00:51:07,160
After that...

691
00:51:16,435 --> 00:51:17,960
I thought of you.

692
00:51:24,035 --> 00:51:25,514
I... I'm sorry, ma'am.

693
00:51:25,515 --> 00:51:28,740
I don't know what you're talking about.

694
00:51:30,835 --> 00:51:34,460
Don't you know how lonely I've been, Jim?

695
00:51:39,235 --> 00:51:40,485
You're gone...

696
00:51:44,355 --> 00:51:45,455
You're dead.

697
00:51:50,435 --> 00:51:53,035
I cry every night.

698
00:51:58,035 --> 00:52:00,560
How am I supposed to survive?

699
00:52:02,635 --> 00:52:03,035
God.

700
00:52:13,155 --> 00:52:15,830
Rachel... it will be all right.

701
00:52:19,235 --> 00:52:21,035
I'm so sorry, but...

702
00:52:22,555 --> 00:52:25,530
everything is gonna be all right? Okay?

703
00:52:27,235 --> 00:52:28,335
I buried you.

704
00:52:30,635 --> 00:52:35,434
I buried an empty casket. Your body
rained down lumps of flesh splashing

705
00:52:35,435 --> 00:52:36,835
into the sea eaten by sharks.

706
00:52:40,835 --> 00:52:44,460
My Jim is dead,
So who the fuck are you?

707
00:52:46,635 --> 00:52:48,510
Who the fuck are you?!

708
00:52:49,155 --> 00:52:51,380
Who are you?! Who are you?!

709
00:53:01,035 --> 00:53:02,754
I'm sorry about that.

710
00:53:02,755 --> 00:53:06,034
I didn't want to interrupt, I thought
she might tell you something, but...

711
00:53:06,035 --> 00:53:08,074
we found her down by the lighthouse,

712
00:53:08,075 --> 00:53:09,425
skipping stones.

713
00:53:10,835 --> 00:53:14,434
We have no idea how she got out there. I'm going
to ask you both to go down into basement.

714
00:53:14,435 --> 00:53:18,434
There's food, water, and cots.
It's the safest place to be

715
00:53:18,435 --> 00:53:20,485
when the hurricane hits.

716
00:53:23,955 --> 00:53:25,954
Are you all right?
You look pale.

717
00:53:25,955 --> 00:53:27,955
I'm fine, it's just uh...

718
00:53:29,035 --> 00:53:30,710
Boss, are you okay?

719
00:53:31,715 --> 00:53:34,034
It's just so Goddamn bright? Isn't it?

720
00:53:34,035 --> 00:53:38,514
Photo sensitivity, headaches sometimes?
Marshal are you having a migraine?

721
00:53:38,515 --> 00:53:39,565
I'll be alright.

722
00:53:47,435 --> 00:53:50,874
- What's wrong with him.
- Take these, marshal. You'll sleep a couple
of hours, wake up clear as a bell.

723
00:53:50,875 --> 00:53:53,234
He's having a migraine.
Imagine someone sawed open your head and

724
00:53:53,235 --> 00:53:55,274
filled it with razors then shook it
as hard as they could.

725
00:53:55,275 --> 00:53:56,754
Take the pills, marshal.

726
00:53:56,755 --> 00:54:01,280
- No... I don't want the pills.
- It'll stop the pain. Take the pills.

727
00:54:04,955 --> 00:54:07,030
He's going to need to lie down.

728
00:54:28,035 --> 00:54:29,735
Careful. All right.

729
00:54:31,155 --> 00:54:32,980
Gonna be okay. Relax.

730
00:54:39,635 --> 00:54:41,460
- Who is that?
- Him?

731
00:54:42,435 --> 00:54:44,035
That's the warden.

732
00:54:46,035 --> 00:54:48,860
Don't you worry about him, alright?

733
00:54:54,315 --> 00:54:56,790
Looks like an ex-military prick.

734
00:54:57,635 --> 00:55:01,210
You know what? I ain't gonna argue 
with you on that one.

735
00:56:21,955 --> 00:56:24,130
You should have saved me.

736
00:56:26,155 --> 00:56:28,955
You should have saved all of us.

737
00:56:57,035 --> 00:56:58,085
Hey buddy. Hey.

738
00:57:01,315 --> 00:57:02,015
Laeddis.

739
00:57:03,235 --> 00:57:03,635
Yes.

740
00:57:15,835 --> 00:57:16,735
Hi, buddy.

741
00:57:18,155 --> 00:57:20,205
No hard feelings, right?

742
00:57:26,435 --> 00:57:27,910
No hard feelings.

743
00:57:41,035 --> 00:57:43,310
Little something for later.

744
00:57:46,635 --> 00:57:49,135
Because I know how much you need it.

745
00:57:54,635 --> 00:57:56,960
Clock's ticking, my friend.

746
00:57:57,355 --> 00:57:59,730
We're running out of time.

747
00:58:08,715 --> 00:58:10,515
Give me a hand here.

748
00:58:32,235 --> 00:58:34,260
I could get into trouble.

749
00:59:00,835 --> 00:59:01,710
I'm dead?

750
00:59:04,835 --> 00:59:07,060
I'm so sorry.

751
00:59:07,435 --> 00:59:10,585
Why didn't you save me?

752
00:59:11,155 --> 00:59:15,034
I tried, I wanted to,
but by the time I got there,

753
00:59:15,035 --> 00:59:16,485
it was too late.

754
00:59:38,435 --> 00:59:39,835
See?

755
00:59:41,715 --> 00:59:43,390
Aren't they beautiful?

756
01:00:35,715 --> 01:00:38,015
Why are you all wet, baby?

757
01:00:40,235 --> 01:00:41,910
Laeddis isn't dead.

758
01:00:43,235 --> 01:00:44,535
He isn't gone.

759
01:00:46,035 --> 01:00:47,485
He's still here.

760
01:00:50,635 --> 01:00:51,310
I know.

761
01:00:51,635 --> 01:00:53,954
We need to find him, Teddy.

762
01:00:53,955 --> 01:00:56,680
You need to find him and 
you kill him dead.

763
01:01:13,155 --> 01:01:14,105
Shhh. It's okay.

764
01:01:26,235 --> 01:01:26,785
Shh. Again!

765
01:01:27,235 --> 01:01:28,935
The generator is faulty.

766
01:01:33,855 --> 01:01:35,455
Are you okay boss?

767
01:01:37,655 --> 01:01:39,505
This goddamn migraine!

768
01:01:39,535 --> 01:01:43,810
Back up generators failed.
The whole place has gone crazy.

769
01:01:44,935 --> 01:01:47,010
What do you want to do?

770
01:01:52,255 --> 01:01:52,880
Christ!

771
01:01:53,615 --> 01:01:55,840
No, no, no!
Put it down.

772
01:01:56,455 --> 01:01:57,280
Now! Now!

773
01:02:07,815 --> 01:02:10,489
You think the whole
electrical system is fried?

774
01:02:10,490 --> 01:02:13,454
I'd say that it's a good possibility.

775
01:02:13,455 --> 01:02:15,374
All electronic security...

776
01:02:15,375 --> 01:02:17,075
fences, gates, the doors

777
01:02:18,135 --> 01:02:18,885
Come on.

778
01:02:19,215 --> 01:02:21,574
Nice day for a stroll
don't you think?

779
01:02:21,575 --> 01:02:24,525
To ward C for example.

780
01:02:26,535 --> 01:02:29,285
Maybe we'll run into Andrew Leaddis.

781
01:02:33,455 --> 01:02:36,214
The guy I told you about, George Noyce?

782
01:02:36,215 --> 01:02:38,974
He told me this is where they keep
the worse ones.

783
01:02:38,975 --> 01:02:42,625
The guys even the other inmates
are scared of.

784
01:02:43,455 --> 01:02:45,689
Noyce give you anything on the layout?

785
01:02:45,690 --> 01:02:46,665
Not really.

786
01:02:46,935 --> 01:02:50,688
All that he remembers was people
scream day and night. There were no windows.

787
01:02:50,689 --> 01:02:52,964
There were bars everywhere.

788
01:03:12,534 --> 01:03:13,734
Jesus Christ!

789
01:03:14,734 --> 01:03:17,259
First time
on ward C, right?

790
01:03:17,689 --> 01:03:19,333
- Yes, yes...
- Yes.

791
01:03:19,334 --> 01:03:23,373
- Yeah, heard stories, but...
- Trust me, sons. You haven't heard shit.

792
01:03:23,374 --> 01:03:25,773
We got most of the bugsies locked down now,

793
01:03:25,774 --> 01:03:27,733
But some of them are still loose.

794
01:03:27,734 --> 01:03:30,373
If you see one don't try
to restrain him yourselves.

795
01:03:30,374 --> 01:03:32,013
These fuckers will kill you.

796
01:03:32,014 --> 01:03:32,564
Clear?

797
01:03:33,654 --> 01:03:36,879
Alright. Get your asses moving then.
Go on.

798
01:04:31,014 --> 01:04:31,964
He's here.

799
01:04:36,014 --> 01:04:36,714
Laeddis.

800
01:04:38,214 --> 01:04:39,589
I can feel him.

801
01:04:43,334 --> 01:04:44,784
Tag! You're it.

802
01:04:46,454 --> 01:04:46,854
Ted!

803
01:05:44,494 --> 01:05:45,669
Listen to me!

804
01:05:46,378 --> 01:05:48,302
Listen!
I do not want to leave, all right?

805
01:05:48,662 --> 01:05:52,466
Why would anyone want to?
We hear things here.

806
01:05:52,586 --> 01:05:55,068
About the outside world.
About atolls.

807
01:05:55,108 --> 01:05:57,591
About the h-bomb tests.

808
01:05:57,711 --> 01:06:00,594
You know how
a hydrogen bomb works?

809
01:06:00,634 --> 01:06:03,077
- With... Hydrogen?
- That's funny.

810
01:06:03,197 --> 01:06:05,679
- Boss!
- Other bombs explode, right?

811
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:09,363
But not the hydrogen bomb
It implodes.

812
01:06:09,403 --> 01:06:13,687
Creating an explosion to the thousandth
millionth degree.

813
01:06:13,727 --> 01:06:15,489
- Do you get it?
- Yeah. Yeah.

814
01:06:15,529 --> 01:06:17,131
- Do you?
- I get it!

815
01:06:17,131 --> 01:06:19,013
Let em go!

816
01:06:32,827 --> 01:06:34,228
No!

817
01:06:35,829 --> 01:06:36,511
What are you doing?

818
01:06:36,831 --> 01:06:39,434
Jesus Christ, Teddy. Jesus!

819
01:06:39,714 --> 01:06:41,636
You got Billings?

820
01:06:41,956 --> 01:06:44,719
What's the fucks the matter with you guys?
Catch them, not kill them!

821
01:06:44,759 --> 01:06:46,361
He jumped at us.

822
01:06:46,441 --> 01:06:49,764
You give me a hand with him.
We've got to get him to the infirmary.

823
01:06:49,764 --> 01:06:53,048
No! Not you, not you.
Take a walk.

824
01:06:53,088 --> 01:06:54,049
Come on!

825
01:06:54,129 --> 01:06:56,651
Paula's gonna have my Goddamn
balls for this..

826
01:07:26,081 --> 01:07:28,003
Laeddis....

827
01:07:49,583 --> 01:07:51,905
Laeddis....

828
01:07:55,311 --> 01:07:58,835
You're dead, we're all dead.
This is hell, we're in hell.

829
01:08:01,197 --> 01:08:02,639
Please...

830
01:08:02,639 --> 01:08:04,040
...................

836
01:08:05,802 --> 01:08:06,803
Stop me.
Before I kill more.

837
01:08:13,930 --> 01:08:15,412
Go!

838
01:08:18,054 --> 01:08:19,536
Please, please!

839
01:08:28,743 --> 01:08:30,066
Laeddis ...

840
01:08:37,273 --> 01:08:40,556
You told me I'd be free of
this place.

841
01:08:41,756 --> 01:08:43,278
You promised.

842
01:08:44,280 --> 01:08:46,481
You lied.

843
01:08:46,962 --> 01:08:48,083
Laeddis?

844
01:08:52,448 --> 01:08:53,970
Laeddis!?

845
01:08:55,491 --> 01:08:57,253
That's pretty damned funny.

846
01:08:58,575 --> 01:08:59,896
Your voice...

847
01:09:00,176 --> 01:09:01,778
Don't you recognize it?

848
01:09:01,779 --> 01:09:04,221
After all the talks we've had?

849
01:09:04,261 --> 01:09:06,704
After all the lies
that you've told me?

850
01:09:06,784 --> 01:09:08,586
Let me see your face.

851
01:09:08,866 --> 01:09:11,108
They say I'm theirs now.

852
01:09:11,869 --> 01:09:14,592
They say I'll never leave here.

853
01:09:15,313 --> 01:09:17,875
Your match is about to go out.

854
01:09:19,797 --> 01:09:21,879
Let me see your goddamn face now!

855
01:09:21,919 --> 01:09:22,880
Why?

856
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:25,243
So you can lie to me more?

857
01:09:25,283 --> 01:09:27,565
- This isn't about the truth!
- Yes it is.

858
01:09:27,605 --> 01:09:31,209
- It's about exposing the truth.
- This is about you!

859
01:09:31,249 --> 01:09:32,690
And Laeddis.

860
01:09:33,892 --> 01:09:36,695
That's all it's ever been about.

861
01:09:36,735 --> 01:09:38,336
I was incidental.

862
01:09:39,417 --> 01:09:40,819
A way in.

863
01:09:43,421 --> 01:09:44,623
George?

864
01:09:45,143 --> 01:09:46,424
George Noyce?

865
01:09:47,225 --> 01:09:50,509
No, it's not possible,
You can't be here.

866
01:09:50,749 --> 01:09:52,030
Do you like it?

867
01:09:53,632 --> 01:09:55,554
Who did this to you, George?

868
01:09:55,554 --> 01:09:56,835
You did!

869
01:09:57,316 --> 01:09:58,597
What the hell do you mean?

870
01:09:58,637 --> 01:10:00,639
What are you talking
all of your fucking talk

871
01:10:00,679 --> 01:10:02,961
And I'm back here because of you!

872
01:10:03,001 --> 01:10:05,204
George, I how did they get you out of Dedham.
Huh?

873
01:10:05,244 --> 01:10:08,447
However this happened, Im gonna 
find a way to fix this. You understand me?

874
01:10:08,487 --> 01:10:09,808
I'll never get out now.

875
01:10:09,848 --> 01:10:12,451
I got out once, But not twice, never twice.

876
01:10:12,491 --> 01:10:15,654
- Tell me how they got you here?
- They knew!

877
01:10:15,854 --> 01:10:17,056
Don't you get it?

878
01:10:17,376 --> 01:10:20,059
Everything you were up to.
Your whole plan.

879
01:10:20,659 --> 01:10:22,942
This is a game. All of this...

880
01:10:23,462 --> 01:10:24,744
is for you.

881
01:10:24,944 --> 01:10:26,866
You're not investigating anything.

882
01:10:27,066 --> 01:10:30,469
You're a fucking rat
in a maze.

883
01:10:30,750 --> 01:10:31,751
George...

884
01:10:32,191 --> 01:10:34,193
you're wrong.

885
01:10:34,874 --> 01:10:36,075
Really?

886
01:10:36,476 --> 01:10:39,959
Been alone much since
you got here?

887
01:10:40,079 --> 01:10:42,081
I'm been with my partner.

888
01:10:42,201 --> 01:10:45,084
You have never worked
with him before, have you?

889
01:10:45,885 --> 01:10:46,886
He's a...

890
01:10:47,487 --> 01:10:49,649
US Marshal from Seattle.

891
01:10:49,689 --> 01:10:52,612
You have never worked
with him before, have you?

892
01:10:53,893 --> 01:10:55,054
George, look...

893
01:10:55,095 --> 01:10:58,378
I know people.
I trust this man.

894
01:11:02,382 --> 01:11:04,824
Then, they've already won.

895
01:11:06,826 --> 01:11:11,431
Fuck!

896
01:11:11,992 --> 01:11:14,514
They're going to...

897
01:11:14,554 --> 01:11:16,917
take me to the lighthouse.

898
01:11:16,997 --> 01:11:19,439
They're going to
cut into my brain.

899
01:11:20,120 --> 01:11:24,444
And I'm only here because of you!

900
01:11:25,245 --> 01:11:28,729
George, I'm going to get you out of here.
You're not going to the lighthouse.

901
01:11:29,650 --> 01:11:34,134
You can't dig out the truth and
kill Laeddis at the same time.

902
01:11:34,174 --> 01:11:36,457
You've got to make a choice
you understand that, don't you?

903
01:11:36,457 --> 01:11:37,938
I'm not here to kill anyone.

904
01:11:38,018 --> 01:11:41,662
- Liar!
- I not gonna kill him! I swear to you ...

905
01:11:42,263 --> 01:11:44,265
She's dead.

906
01:11:44,665 --> 01:11:46,947
Let her go...

907
01:11:47,268 --> 01:11:48,349
Let her go.

908
01:11:49,470 --> 01:11:50,751
Tell him Teddy...

909
01:11:51,752 --> 01:11:53,955
Tell him why.

910
01:11:55,957 --> 01:11:57,959
You've got to do it.
There's no other way.

911
01:11:58,639 --> 01:12:02,764
- Let her go.
- Tell him about the day you brought me my locket...

912
01:12:02,804 --> 01:12:03,765
You've gotta do it!

913
01:12:03,885 --> 01:12:07,168
How I told you my heart was breaking.
And you asked me why?

914
01:12:07,208 --> 01:12:08,930
She's fucking with your head.

915
01:12:08,970 --> 01:12:12,053
And then i told you
it was from happiness.

916
01:12:12,173 --> 01:12:13,575
She'll kill you. She's going to kill you.

917
01:12:16,778 --> 01:12:20,301
You want to uncover the truth?
You've gotta let her go ...

918
01:12:20,902 --> 01:12:23,865
- I can't.
- You have to let her go!

919
01:12:23,905 --> 01:12:25,707
I can't!
I can't.

920
01:12:31,713 --> 01:12:34,876
Then you'll never leave
this island.

921
01:12:40,082 --> 01:12:41,323
Dolores?

922
01:12:48,090 --> 01:12:50,492
He's not in this ward.

923
01:12:51,093 --> 01:12:52,895
He was transferred...

924
01:12:53,335 --> 01:12:54,616
Out of here.

925
01:12:56,418 --> 01:12:58,340
If he's not in ward A,

926
01:12:59,021 --> 01:13:01,824
there's only one place he can be

927
01:13:06,028 --> 01:13:07,830
The lighthouse.

928
01:13:15,037 --> 01:13:16,118
Hey!

929
01:13:18,961 --> 01:13:20,243
God help you.

930
01:13:28,651 --> 01:13:31,334
Boss, we got problems.
McPherson and Cawley are in the building.

931
01:13:31,374 --> 01:13:34,057
They heard an orderly went batshit on a patient,

932
01:13:34,097 --> 01:13:36,779
They're looking all over the place for him.
They're on the way to the roof.

933
01:13:36,860 --> 01:13:38,141
Let's get the hell out of here.

934
01:13:38,181 --> 01:13:39,142
This way.

935
01:13:41,144 --> 01:13:44,067
Just keep going.
We belong here

936
01:13:53,076 --> 01:13:56,400
- What happened to you?
- What do you mean?

937
01:13:57,200 --> 01:13:58,842
Where were you?

938
01:13:58,882 --> 01:14:01,044
After we got that guy to the infirmary,

939
01:14:01,084 --> 01:14:03,206
I took a little detour
to patient records.

940
01:14:03,287 --> 01:14:04,768
Did you ever find Laeddis?

941
01:14:05,769 --> 01:14:06,770
No.

942
01:14:06,890 --> 01:14:09,773
- No. I never found him.
- Well I've got the next best thing.

943
01:14:09,893 --> 01:14:11,255
His intake form.

944
01:14:11,295 --> 01:14:14,017
It was the only thing in his file.
No session notes. No incident reports.

945
01:14:14,017 --> 01:14:15,899
No photographs... just this.
It was weird.

946
01:14:16,020 --> 01:14:17,701
Here, take a look.

947
01:14:18,502 --> 01:14:19,783
I'll look at it later.

948
01:14:21,705 --> 01:14:22,826
What's the matter, boss?

949
01:14:23,427 --> 01:14:25,709
I'll take a look at it later,
that's all.

950
01:14:27,992 --> 01:14:29,313
Ashecliffe's that way.

951
01:14:29,433 --> 01:14:31,195
I'm not going to Ashecliffe.

952
01:14:32,636 --> 01:14:34,118
I'm going to the lighthouse.

953
01:14:34,999 --> 01:14:37,642
I'm going to find out what
the fuck is happening on this island.

954
01:14:50,615 --> 01:14:51,736
Here it is.

955
01:14:52,337 --> 01:14:53,458
Damn!

956
01:14:54,539 --> 01:14:56,261
We're too far South.
We're gonna have to double back.

957
01:14:56,861 --> 01:14:59,264
There's no way we could cross those rocks.

958
01:14:59,344 --> 01:15:02,067
There could be a way behind those trees.

959
01:15:02,067 --> 01:15:03,828
Maybe a path that goes around the rocks
that leads over to the lighthouse.

960
01:15:03,948 --> 01:15:06,671
What are we doing here?
We've got the intake form.

961
01:15:07,152 --> 01:15:10,555
It proves there's a 67th patient...
which they've said repeatedly doesn't exist.

962
01:15:12,957 --> 01:15:14,959
I'm getting to that lighthouse.
Do you understand?

963
01:15:17,561 --> 01:15:20,084
What the hell can I say to you
to stop you?

964
01:15:20,484 --> 01:15:21,485
Why would you want to Chuck?
Why?

965
01:15:21,565 --> 01:15:25,970
Because climbing down there
when it's dark is a thin step short
to suicide. That's why.

966
01:15:26,010 --> 01:15:26,971
Okay.

967
01:15:27,171 --> 01:15:30,374
Maybe you better sit this one out then.

968
01:15:31,896 --> 01:15:35,500
You brought me into this, boss.
And now I am trapped here on this rock.

969
01:15:35,500 --> 01:15:36,381
On this island.

970
01:15:36,501 --> 01:15:40,184
Without no one to rely on but eachother.
And now you're acting like.........

971
01:15:40,224 --> 01:15:41,185
Like what? Like what?

972
01:15:41,265 --> 01:15:42,707
How am I acting?

973
01:15:46,511 --> 01:15:50,515
What the hell happened back there
in those cells, Ted?

974
01:15:55,400 --> 01:16:00,325
- What do you think the weather is like in Portland, Chuck?
- I'm from Seattle.

975
01:16:02,207 --> 01:16:03,608
Seattle?

976
01:16:08,013 --> 01:16:10,736
I'll going on...alone.

977
01:16:12,297 --> 01:16:13,819
I'm going with you, boss.

978
01:16:13,859 --> 01:16:15,420
I said alone.

979
01:16:17,142 --> 01:16:18,744
Fine.

980
01:16:43,329 --> 01:16:44,570
Damn it!

981
01:16:45,651 --> 01:16:46,852
Damn it!

982
01:16:51,777 --> 01:16:54,740
I knew it wouldn't take long.
But I couldn't get to it. The tide was up.

983
01:17:03,950 --> 01:17:05,071
Chuck!

984
01:17:07,473 --> 01:17:08,675
Chuck!

985
01:18:08,255 --> 01:18:09,256
Come on!

986
01:18:42,891 --> 01:18:44,092
Chuck!

987
01:18:44,573 --> 01:18:46,174
Where are you, Chuck?

988
01:19:09,918 --> 01:19:11,200
Chuck!

989
01:19:12,801 --> 01:19:14,203
Chuck!

990
01:19:56,926 --> 01:19:58,168
Who are you?

991
01:20:00,650 --> 01:20:01,931
I'm Teddy Daniels.

992
01:20:02,052 --> 01:20:03,053
I'm a cop.

993
01:20:04,254 --> 01:20:05,375
You're the marshal.

994
01:20:07,257 --> 01:20:08,378
That's right.

995
01:20:10,660 --> 01:20:11,661
Would you mind...

996
01:20:11,781 --> 01:20:14,464
taking your hand from behind
your back, please?

997
01:20:14,504 --> 01:20:15,465
Why?

998
01:20:15,786 --> 01:20:17,267
Why?!

999
01:20:17,868 --> 01:20:20,671
I want to make sure what you're
holding won't hurt me.

1000
01:20:27,798 --> 01:20:28,879
I'm gonna keep this...

1001
01:20:30,280 --> 01:20:31,562
If you don't mind.

1002
01:20:32,803 --> 01:20:34,565
Fine by me.

1003
01:20:46,097 --> 01:20:47,218
You're Rachel Solando.

1004
01:20:49,380 --> 01:20:50,701
The real one.

1005
01:20:54,105 --> 01:20:55,826
Did you kill your children?

1006
01:20:57,628 --> 01:20:58,709
I never had children.

1007
01:21:00,431 --> 01:21:01,512
I was never married.

1008
01:21:03,514 --> 01:21:06,838
And before I was a patient
in Ashecliff, I worked here.

1009
01:21:08,599 --> 01:21:09,921
You were a nurse?

1010
01:21:11,603 --> 01:21:13,204
I was a doctor, marshal.

1011
01:21:17,048 --> 01:21:18,209
You think I'm crazy?

1012
01:21:18,730 --> 01:21:21,332
- No, I ...
- And if I say I'm not crazy ...

1013
01:21:21,933 --> 01:21:24,616
well that hardly helps, does it?

1014
01:21:25,937 --> 01:21:29,140
That's the Kafkaesque genius of it.

1015
01:21:32,143 --> 01:21:33,345
People tell the world you're crazy

1016
01:21:34,146 --> 01:21:35,427
and all your protests to the contrary,

1017
01:21:35,947 --> 01:21:37,069
just confirms what they're saying.

1018
01:21:40,152 --> 01:21:42,154
I'm not following you.
I'm sorry.

1019
01:21:42,634 --> 01:21:43,755
Once you are declared insane,

1020
01:21:44,636 --> 01:21:47,279
then anything you do is called
a part of an insanity.

1021
01:21:47,279 --> 01:21:49,882
Your reasonable protests
or denial.

1022
01:21:50,963 --> 01:21:53,085
Valid fears,
paranoia.

1023
01:21:53,085 --> 01:21:55,167
Survival instincts.

1024
01:21:55,768 --> 01:21:56,769
Defense mechanisms.

1025
01:21:57,770 --> 01:22:00,052
You're smarter than you look marshal.
That's probably not a good thing.

1026
01:22:00,893 --> 01:22:02,575
Tell me something...

1027
01:22:02,775 --> 01:22:03,896
Yeah...

1028
01:22:05,778 --> 01:22:07,379
What happened to you?

1029
01:22:08,180 --> 01:22:10,783
I started asking about these large
shipments of sodium-anatol.

1030
01:22:11,664 --> 01:22:14,587
- An opium-based hallucinogen.
- Psychotropic drugs.

1031
01:22:16,108 --> 01:22:17,390
I asked about the surgeries, too.

1032
01:22:20,673 --> 01:22:22,275
Ever heard of trans-orbital lobotomy?

1033
01:22:24,197 --> 01:22:25,478
They zap the patient with electroshocks,

1034
01:22:26,599 --> 01:22:30,323
then go through the eye with an ice pick

1035
01:22:31,404 --> 01:22:33,006
and pull out some nerve fibers.

1036
01:22:36,009 --> 01:22:37,330
Makes the patients much more obedient.

1037
01:22:38,411 --> 01:22:40,133
Tractable.

1038
01:22:40,934 --> 01:22:41,935
It's barbaric.

1039
01:22:43,336 --> 01:22:44,417
Unconscionable.

1040
01:22:45,618 --> 01:22:50,023
Do you know how pain enters the
body marshal? Do you?

1041
01:22:50,944 --> 01:22:52,305
Depends on where you hurt.

1042
01:22:53,226 --> 01:22:54,508
No, it has nothing to do with the flesh.

1043
01:22:55,108 --> 01:22:56,429
The brain controls pain.

1044
01:22:57,831 --> 01:23:01,435
The brain controls fear, empathy,
sleep, hunger, anger... everything.

1045
01:23:04,237 --> 01:23:05,118
What If you could control it?

1046
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:07,321
The brain?

1047
01:23:07,441 --> 01:23:08,962
Re-create a man,

1048
01:23:10,163 --> 01:23:11,445
so he doesn't feel pain.

1049
01:23:12,045 --> 01:23:14,047
Or love. Or sympathy.

1050
01:23:15,849 --> 01:23:19,733
A man who can't be interrogated
because he has no memories to confess.

1051
01:23:22,736 --> 01:23:24,258
You can never take away
all a man's memories.

1052
01:23:24,458 --> 01:23:25,739
Never.

1053
01:23:25,980 --> 01:23:29,263
Marshal, the North Koreans
used American POWs

1054
01:23:30,064 --> 01:23:32,466
during their brainwashing experiments.

1055
01:23:32,546 --> 01:23:34,989
They turned soldiers into traitors.
That's what they are doing here.

1056
01:23:35,069 --> 01:23:39,473
They're creating ghosts to go out in the world.
And do things sane men never do.

1057
01:23:39,553 --> 01:23:42,261
To have that kind of ability, that kind of knowledge.

1058
01:23:42,844 --> 01:23:43,365
That would take years.

1059
01:23:44,559 --> 01:23:47,882
Years of research,
hundreds of patients to experiment on.

1060
01:23:49,884 --> 01:23:53,007
50 years from now,
people will look back

1061
01:23:53,007 --> 01:23:55,570
and say, "Here. This place
is where it all began."

1062
01:23:56,491 --> 01:23:58,573
The Nazis used the Jews.
The Soviets

1063
01:23:58,613 --> 01:24:01,176
used prisoners in their own gulags
and we...

1064
01:24:01,896 --> 01:24:03,017
We tested patients,

1065
01:24:03,818 --> 01:24:04,899
on Shutter Island.

1066
01:24:06,181 --> 01:24:07,702
No, they won't ...
No

1067
01:24:12,387 --> 01:24:13,508
You do understand

1068
01:24:17,112 --> 01:24:19,114
That they can't let you leave?

1069
01:24:19,634 --> 01:24:20,635
I am a federal marshal ...

1070
01:24:21,396 --> 01:24:22,718
They can't stop me.

1071
01:24:24,119 --> 01:24:25,240
I was an esteemed psychiatrist,

1072
01:24:27,603 --> 01:24:29,605
from a respected family.

1073
01:24:30,606 --> 01:24:32,127
It didn't matter.

1074
01:24:35,050 --> 01:24:36,131
Let me ask you ...

1075
01:24:37,132 --> 01:24:38,053
any past traumas in your life?

1076
01:24:42,938 --> 01:24:44,059
Yes. Why? Why would that matter?

1077
01:24:44,820 --> 01:24:46,422
Because they can point to some
event in your past and say

1078
01:24:46,462 --> 01:24:48,824
it is the reason you lost your sanity......

1079
01:24:49,545 --> 01:24:51,147
So that when they commit you here

1080
01:24:51,747 --> 01:24:55,351
Your friends and colleagues will say, 
"Of course he cracked."

1081
01:24:56,352 --> 01:24:58,874
"And who wouldn't have,
after what he'd been through."

1082
01:24:58,874 --> 01:25:01,237
That could be said of anyone

1083
01:25:01,357 --> 01:25:03,880
- anyone at all.
- The point is they're going to say it about you.

1084
01:25:07,563 --> 01:25:08,684
How's your head?

1085
01:25:09,766 --> 01:25:12,288
- My head?
- Any funny dreams lately?

1086
01:25:12,969 --> 01:25:16,973
Trouble sleeping? Headaches?

1087
01:25:18,454 --> 01:25:20,176
I am prone to migraines. Yes.

1088
01:25:20,216 --> 01:25:21,177
Jesus!

1089
01:25:24,100 --> 01:25:25,301
You haven't taken any pills, have you?

1090
01:25:26,182 --> 01:25:28,522
- I mean even aspirin?
- They hit the aspirin?

1091
01:25:28,522 --> 01:25:30,028
Jesus!

1092
01:25:30,306 --> 01:25:33,390
And you ate the food in the cafeteria and drank
coffee they gave you.

1093
01:25:33,870 --> 01:25:35,992
You tell me at least that
you've been smoking your own cigarettes.

1094
01:25:38,595 --> 01:25:41,398
No... no.

1095
01:25:42,799 --> 01:25:44,000
No. I haven't.

1096
01:25:44,601 --> 01:25:47,524
It takes 36 to 48 hours for
neuroleptic narcotics...

1097
01:25:48,005 --> 01:25:51,008
To reach sufficient levels in
the blood stream.

1098
01:25:51,048 --> 01:25:52,809
Pulse becomes first

1099
01:25:53,810 --> 01:25:55,813
First the fingertips and then
eventually the whole hand.

1100
01:25:57,815 --> 01:26:01,018
Seen any waking nightmares lately,
marshal?

1101
01:26:04,301 --> 01:26:06,023
Tell me what goes on in that lighthouse?

1102
01:26:07,745 --> 01:26:08,826
Tell me.

1103
01:26:10,027 --> 01:26:11,909
Brain surgery.

1104
01:26:12,630 --> 01:26:16,353
"Let's open the skull and see
what happens if we pull on this" kind.

1105
01:26:16,914 --> 01:26:19,156
"We learned it from the Nazi's" kind.

1106
01:26:21,839 --> 01:26:23,561
It's where they create the ghosts.

1107
01:26:25,162 --> 01:26:27,044
Who knows about this?

1108
01:26:27,645 --> 01:26:29,367
On the island I mean. Who?

1109
01:26:31,729 --> 01:26:33,050
Everyone.

1110
01:26:33,171 --> 01:26:36,454
Oh come on. The nurses? The orderlies?

1111
01:26:37,455 --> 01:26:39,857
- They couldn't possibly know...
- Everyone.

1112
01:26:58,076 --> 01:27:00,198
You can't stay here.

1113
01:27:00,679 --> 01:27:04,002
They think I'm dead, that I drowned. I'm afraid
if they come looking for you, they might find me.

1114
01:27:05,003 --> 01:27:06,364
I'm sorry, but you have to go.

1115
01:27:13,492 --> 01:27:14,973
I'm gonna come back for you.

1116
01:27:15,214 --> 01:27:18,096
I won't be here. I move during the day.
new places every night.

1117
01:27:18,136 --> 01:27:20,419
But I could come get you
off of this island.

1118
01:27:20,419 --> 01:27:22,501
Haven't you heard a word I've said?

1119
01:27:23,102 --> 01:27:26,305
The only way off the island
is the ferry and they control it.

1120
01:27:26,905 --> 01:27:28,507
You'll never leave here.

1121
01:27:38,116 --> 01:27:39,437
I had a friend.

1122
01:27:39,918 --> 01:27:42,240
I was with him yesterday,
but we got separated.

1123
01:27:43,001 --> 01:27:44,522
Have you seen him?

1124
01:27:45,804 --> 01:27:47,325
Marshal...

1125
01:27:48,727 --> 01:27:50,448
You have no friends.

1126
01:28:21,881 --> 01:28:23,963
There you are.

1127
01:28:25,845 --> 01:28:28,167
We've been wondering when
you'd show up.

1128
01:28:30,049 --> 01:28:31,370
Have a seat.

1129
01:28:31,971 --> 01:28:33,172
Come on.

1130
01:28:43,703 --> 01:28:45,985
Taking a leisurely stroll? Were we?

1131
01:28:47,186 --> 01:28:48,588
I was just...

1132
01:28:49,309 --> 01:28:50,590
just looking around.

1133
01:28:53,192 --> 01:28:55,195
Did you enjoy
God's latest gift?

1134
01:28:56,796 --> 01:28:58,798
- What?
- God's gift.

1135
01:29:00,320 --> 01:29:01,801
The violence.

1136
01:29:06,486 --> 01:29:09,809
When I came downstairs in my home
and I saw that tree in my living room,

1137
01:29:10,810 --> 01:29:12,813
it reached down for me like a divine hand.

1138
01:29:14,414 --> 01:29:16,096
God loves violence.

1139
01:29:19,099 --> 01:29:21,702
- I hadn't noticed.
- Sure you have.

1140
01:29:22,342 --> 01:29:24,024
Why else would there be so much of it?

1141
01:29:24,825 --> 01:29:26,226
It's in us.

1142
01:29:26,426 --> 01:29:27,628
It's what we are.

1143
01:29:29,349 --> 01:29:32,553
We wage war, we burn sacrifices,
we pillage and plunder

1144
01:29:32,633 --> 01:29:34,194
and tear at the flesh
of our brothers

1145
01:29:34,234 --> 01:29:38,038
and why? Because God gave us violence
to wage in his honor.

1146
01:29:41,242 --> 01:29:43,404
I thought God gave us moral order.

1147
01:29:43,444 --> 01:29:46,046
There is no moral order
as pure as this storm.

1148
01:29:46,927 --> 01:29:48,929
There's no moral order at all.

1149
01:29:49,370 --> 01:29:52,853
There's just this:
can my violence conquer yours?

1150
01:29:58,259 --> 01:30:00,061
- I'm not violent.
- Yes you are.

1151
01:30:01,662 --> 01:30:03,464
You're as violent as they come.

1152
01:30:04,545 --> 01:30:07,268
I know this because I'm as violent as they come.

1153
01:30:08,389 --> 01:30:10,151
With the constraints of society,
we are lifted and

1154
01:30:10,471 --> 01:30:15,276
If I was all that stood between you and a meal, you
would crack my skull with a rock and eat my meaty parts.

1155
01:30:17,999 --> 01:30:19,481
Wouldn't you?

1156
01:30:22,163 --> 01:30:25,807
Cawley thinks you're harmless, that you can be
controlled, but I know different.

1157
01:30:26,968 --> 01:30:30,892
- You don't know me.
- Oh but I do. Oh I know you.

1158
01:30:31,893 --> 01:30:33,975
We've known each other for centuries.

1159
01:30:43,505 --> 01:30:46,108
If I was to sink my teeth into your eye
right now,

1160
01:30:46,148 --> 01:30:49,311
would you be able to stop me before I blinded you?

1161
01:30:53,315 --> 01:30:54,837
Give it a try.

1162
01:30:56,318 --> 01:31:00,322
That's the spirit.

1163
01:31:43,566 --> 01:31:45,048
Where have you been?

1164
01:31:46,169 --> 01:31:48,251
Wandering, just looking at your island.

1165
01:31:48,371 --> 01:31:52,495
Oh I forgot. You're leaving.
Now that Rachel has been found.

1166
01:31:52,976 --> 01:31:54,377
Sure. Yeah.

1167
01:31:56,580 --> 01:31:57,781
Big meeting?

1168
01:31:58,381 --> 01:32:00,784
Oh, yes ...

1169
01:32:00,864 --> 01:32:03,387
Apparently there was an unidentified man
in ward C yesterday

1170
01:32:03,427 --> 01:32:06,790
He subdued a highly dangerous patient.
Quite handily.

1171
01:32:07,991 --> 01:32:08,992
Is that so?

1172
01:32:09,112 --> 01:32:13,517
It seems he had a long conversation with a
paranoid schizophrenic, George Noyce.

1173
01:32:16,520 --> 01:32:19,283
This Noyce,
you said his name was,

1174
01:32:20,204 --> 01:32:23,247
- he's delusional?
- Oh extremely. He can be quite upsetting.

1175
01:32:23,287 --> 01:32:26,290
In fact, two weeks ago, a patient
got so wound up

1176
01:32:26,330 --> 01:32:30,094
by one of Noyce's stories
that he beat him up.

1177
01:32:30,414 --> 01:32:31,936
Cigarette?

1178
01:32:33,297 --> 01:32:35,019
Oh. No, thanks.
I quit.

1179
01:32:36,620 --> 01:32:38,622
So, you're taking the ferry?

1180
01:32:39,223 --> 01:32:40,544
Oh yes. Absolutely. I uh...

1181
01:32:41,225 --> 01:32:42,947
I think we've gotten
all we came here for so.

1182
01:32:43,828 --> 01:32:44,949
"We" marshal?

1183
01:32:47,111 --> 01:32:48,753
Speaking of which. Have you

1184
01:32:49,233 --> 01:32:51,556
- seen him, Doctor?
- Who?

1185
01:32:52,437 --> 01:32:53,958
My partner, Chuck.

1186
01:32:56,641 --> 01:32:58,563
You don't have a partner, Marshal.
You came here alone.

1187
01:33:01,045 --> 01:33:03,528
You know, I've built something valuable here.

1188
01:33:03,568 --> 01:33:06,931
And valuable things have a way of
being misunderstood in their own time.

1189
01:33:07,051 --> 01:33:08,933
Everyone wants a quick fix,
they always have.

1190
01:33:09,054 --> 01:33:12,457
I'm trying to do something that people,
yourself included, don't understand.

1191
01:33:12,577 --> 01:33:14,940
And I'm not going to give up
without a fight.

1192
01:33:16,341 --> 01:33:18,783
I can see that...

1193
01:33:22,467 --> 01:33:24,269
So tell me again
about your partner.

1194
01:33:26,151 --> 01:33:27,993
What partner?

1195
01:34:30,417 --> 01:34:32,058
Marshal...

1196
01:34:33,340 --> 01:34:34,741
Going somewhere?

1197
01:34:35,221 --> 01:34:38,745
No. Just heading out
to the ferry. So...

1198
01:34:40,347 --> 01:34:41,948
I'm afraid it's the other way.

1199
01:34:44,871 --> 01:34:46,673
If you wait a moment,

1200
01:34:47,234 --> 01:34:50,077
I'll find someone who can take you
to the dock.

1201
01:34:53,760 --> 01:34:56,203
What is this, doctor?

1202
01:34:56,243 --> 01:34:58,685
It's just a sedative.

1203
01:34:58,765 --> 01:35:01,288
- It's for precaution.
- Precaution?

1204
01:35:03,690 --> 01:35:07,775
What are you going to do?
Kill me? Marshal.

1205
01:35:08,295 --> 01:35:09,577
You think you deserve it?

1206
01:35:10,057 --> 01:35:12,780
For what?
For provoking you?

1207
01:35:13,300 --> 01:35:15,783
and, forgive me,
what doesn't provoke you?

1208
01:35:16,183 --> 01:35:17,304
Remarks...

1209
01:35:17,705 --> 01:35:19,066
- Words...
- Nazis!

1210
01:35:19,907 --> 01:35:21,389
Well that, too.

1211
01:35:21,909 --> 01:35:23,591
And of course, memories, dreams...

1212
01:35:24,792 --> 01:35:28,716
Did you know that the word "trauma" comes
from the Greek for "wound"?

1213
01:35:29,197 --> 01:35:33,281
And what is the German word for "dream"
"Traumen".

1214
01:35:33,321 --> 01:35:34,402
Traumen.

1215
01:35:35,723 --> 01:35:38,406
Wounds can create monsters.

1216
01:35:38,726 --> 01:35:41,209
And you ...
you are wounded, marshal.

1217
01:35:42,210 --> 01:35:45,013
Wouldn't you agree,
when you see a monster

1218
01:35:45,813 --> 01:35:47,215
you must stop it?

1219
01:35:50,218 --> 01:35:52,220
- I agree.
- Yes...

1220
01:36:36,986 --> 01:36:38,667
What are you doing, baby?

1221
01:36:43,793 --> 01:36:45,354
You've got to get to the ferry.

1222
01:36:45,995 --> 01:36:48,077
No. No. 
No.

1223
01:36:52,081 --> 01:36:55,885
If the world thinks that Chuck is dead,
then he is perfect for their experiments.

1224
01:36:56,486 --> 01:36:58,968
There's only one place they'd take him.

1225
01:37:01,491 --> 01:37:03,893
You go there and you'll die.

1226
01:37:03,973 --> 01:37:07,817
He's my partner. If they are hurting him, if they are
holding him against his will, I've got to bring him out.

1227
01:37:08,178 --> 01:37:10,180
I can't lose anyone else.

1228
01:37:10,820 --> 01:37:14,824
Don't go, Teddy.
Please don't do this. Don't go.

1229
01:37:17,707 --> 01:37:19,589
I'm sorry, honey.

1230
01:37:21,311 --> 01:37:23,914
I love this thing because
you gave it to me

1231
01:37:26,596 --> 01:37:28,518
But the truth is ...

1232
01:37:28,598 --> 01:37:31,521
it's one fucking ugly tie.

1233
01:38:10,361 --> 01:38:11,482
No!

1234
01:39:30,042 --> 01:39:31,844
Don't move!
Stay where you are!

1235
01:39:33,446 --> 01:39:35,047
Are you going to kill me?

1236
01:39:35,448 --> 01:39:39,372
No.
I'm not gonna kill you.

1237
01:41:27,081 --> 01:41:29,843
Why are you all wet, baby?

1238
01:41:30,965 --> 01:41:33,367
- What did you say?
- You know exactly what I said.

1239
01:41:46,300 --> 01:41:48,663
The rifle's empty by the way.

1240
01:41:54,108 --> 01:41:55,910
Have a seat.

1241
01:42:02,397 --> 01:42:05,480
For god's sake dry off
you're going to catch a cold.

1242
01:42:06,601 --> 01:42:07,602
Alright.

1243
01:42:10,205 --> 01:42:12,887
How badly did you hurt the guard?

1244
01:42:15,490 --> 01:42:17,612
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1245
01:42:20,335 --> 01:42:21,897
Yes. He's here.

1246
01:42:22,417 --> 01:42:25,340
Have Dr.Sheehan take a good look
at your man before you send him up.

1247
01:42:27,022 --> 01:42:28,824
So, Dr. Shehan...

1248
01:42:29,424 --> 01:42:30,625
He came on the ferry
this morining.

1249
01:42:31,627 --> 01:42:32,628
Not exactly.

1250
01:42:34,349 --> 01:42:36,832
You blew up my car.
I really loved that car.

1251
01:42:38,153 --> 01:42:39,835
Sorry to hear about that.

1252
01:42:43,158 --> 01:42:44,720
Tremors are getting pretty bad.

1253
01:42:46,161 --> 01:42:47,242
How are the hallucinations?

1254
01:42:48,243 --> 01:42:49,645
Get out of here, Teddy.

1255
01:42:50,846 --> 01:42:52,648
This place is gonna be the end of you.

1256
01:42:55,571 --> 01:42:58,254
- Not bad.
- They'll get worse.

1257
01:42:58,734 --> 01:42:59,775
I know.

1258
01:43:00,656 --> 01:43:02,058
Dr. Solando...

1259
01:43:02,979 --> 01:43:05,341
she told me about neuroleptics.

1260
01:43:05,461 --> 01:43:08,664
Did she now?
And when was this?

1261
01:43:08,784 --> 01:43:13,549
I found the doctor, in a cave out by the cliffs.
But you'll never get to her.

1262
01:43:13,669 --> 01:43:15,191
I don't doubt it.

1263
01:43:15,792 --> 01:43:17,553
Considering she's not real.

1264
01:43:19,075 --> 01:43:21,477
But your hallucinations are
more severe than I thought.

1265
01:43:22,959 --> 01:43:24,881
You are not on neuroleptics.

1266
01:43:25,882 --> 01:43:28,204
You are not on anything
as a matter of fact.

1267
01:43:28,204 --> 01:43:30,487
Then what the fuck is this?
Huh, what the fuck is this?

1268
01:43:30,607 --> 01:43:31,608
Withdrawal.

1269
01:43:31,888 --> 01:43:33,089
Withdrawal?

1270
01:43:33,490 --> 01:43:36,292
From what? I haven't even had a Goddamned
drink since I've been on this island.

1271
01:43:36,333 --> 01:43:37,614
Chlorpromazine.

1272
01:43:37,974 --> 01:43:41,618
I'm not a fan of pharmacology
but I have to say in your case ...

1273
01:43:42,499 --> 01:43:44,781
- Clorpro... what?
- Chlorpromazine.

1274
01:43:45,502 --> 01:43:49,906
The same thing we've
been giving you for the past 24 months.

1275
01:43:51,308 --> 01:43:53,710
So for the past two years

1276
01:43:53,790 --> 01:43:56,313
you've had somebody slipping
me drugs in Boston. Is that it?

1277
01:43:56,353 --> 01:43:58,635
Not Boston.
Here.

1278
01:43:59,636 --> 01:44:03,921
You've been here for two years.
A patient of this institution.

1279
01:44:06,603 --> 01:44:10,527
After everything I seen here, doctor,

1280
01:44:11,008 --> 01:44:13,450
you really think you're gonna
convince me I'm crazy, huh?

1281
01:44:13,530 --> 01:44:17,735
Do you know the kind of people I deal with everyday?
I'm a U.S. marshal. For Gods sake.

1282
01:44:18,255 --> 01:44:21,899
You were a U.S. marshal.
Here's a copy of the intake form.

1283
01:44:21,939 --> 01:44:25,142
You broke into ward C for
proof of the 67th patient

1284
01:44:25,262 --> 01:44:28,145
If you'd gotten it to the mainland,
you could have blown the lid off this place.

1285
01:44:28,666 --> 01:44:29,947
- Wait... wait.
- But somehow

1286
01:44:30,027 --> 01:44:31,749
you couldn't find time
to look at it. Well read it now.

1287
01:44:32,950 --> 01:44:34,152
Go ahead.

1288
01:44:37,835 --> 01:44:39,957
The patient is highly intelligent,
highly delusional.

1289
01:44:40,038 --> 01:44:41,479
Decorated army veteran.

1290
01:44:42,040 --> 01:44:43,481
Present for the
liberation of Dakau.

1291
01:44:44,362 --> 01:44:46,484
Former U.S. marshal.

1292
01:44:46,844 --> 01:44:48,166
Known proclivity for violence.

1293
01:44:48,286 --> 01:44:49,968
Shows no remorse for his crime because
he denies 

1294
01:44:50,048 --> 01:44:53,371
that the crime ever took place.
Highly developed and fantastical

1295
01:44:53,411 --> 01:44:56,574
narratives which preclude facing
the truth of his actions...

1296
01:44:56,695 --> 01:44:57,776
I've had enough of this bullshit.

1297
01:44:57,856 --> 01:44:59,177
Where's my partner, huh?

1298
01:44:59,297 --> 01:45:00,779
Where's Chuck?
Where is he?

1299
01:45:02,100 --> 01:45:03,782
Let's try this another way.

1300
01:45:03,902 --> 01:45:06,264
Your wife's maiden name was
"Chanal". Am I correct?

1301
01:45:06,304 --> 01:45:08,507
- Don't you even talk about her!
- I'm afraid I have to.

1302
01:45:10,188 --> 01:45:13,071
Notice anything these four names have in common?

1303
01:45:13,592 --> 01:45:14,673
Your rule of 4.

1304
01:45:15,193 --> 01:45:17,596
- Andrew, what do you see?
- If you have done anything

1305
01:45:17,676 --> 01:45:21,680
- to my partner, doctor. That is a violation ...
- Focus, Andrew. What do you see?

1306
01:45:22,401 --> 01:45:24,803
The names ...
have the same letters.

1307
01:45:24,883 --> 01:45:27,326
Edward Daniels has exactly the same
13 letters

1308
01:45:27,406 --> 01:45:29,888
as Andrew Laeddis.
The same as Rachel Solando

1309
01:45:29,928 --> 01:45:32,331
and Dolores Chanal. The names

1310
01:45:32,411 --> 01:45:34,733
- Are anagrams for each other.
- Your tactics, they're not going to

1311
01:45:35,214 --> 01:45:36,695
work on me.

1312
01:45:36,735 --> 01:45:39,018
You came here for the truth.
Here it is.

1313
01:45:39,218 --> 01:45:40,820
Your name is Andrew Laeddis.

1314
01:45:41,100 --> 01:45:44,744
The 67th patient at Ashecliffe
is you, Andrew.

1315
01:45:45,424 --> 01:45:46,826
Bullshit.

1316
01:45:47,106 --> 01:45:49,548
You were committed here by
court order 24 months ago.

1317
01:45:49,629 --> 01:45:52,832
Your crime is terrible.
One you can't forgive yourself for.

1318
01:45:52,872 --> 01:45:54,634
So you invented
another self.

1319
01:45:59,519 --> 01:46:00,640
Let's get down to the facts.

1320
01:46:01,160 --> 01:46:05,044
You've created a story in which
you're not a murderer, you are hero.

1321
01:46:05,445 --> 01:46:06,926
Still a U.S marshal.

1322
01:46:06,966 --> 01:46:08,368
Only here at Ashecliffe
because of a case

1323
01:46:08,648 --> 01:46:09,969
and you've uncovered a conspiracy

1324
01:46:10,370 --> 01:46:12,732
So that anything we tell you about
who you are, what you've done

1325
01:46:13,373 --> 01:46:15,855
you can dismiss as lies, Andrew.

1326
01:46:15,895 --> 01:46:16,976
My name is Edward Daniels.

1327
01:46:17,577 --> 01:46:20,380
I've been hearing this fantasy
for two years now. I know every detail.

1328
01:46:20,740 --> 01:46:23,143
Patient 67. The storm.
Rachel Solando.

1329
01:46:23,263 --> 01:46:25,785
Your missing partner.
The dreams you have every night.

1330
01:46:25,785 --> 01:46:28,148
You were at Dakau,
But you may not have killed any guards.

1331
01:46:32,072 --> 01:46:34,955
I wish I could let you just
live in your fantasy world.

1332
01:46:35,475 --> 01:46:36,677
I really do.

1333
01:46:37,157 --> 01:46:41,802
But you're violent, trained, dangerous.
You're the most dangerous patient we have.

1334
01:46:42,162 --> 01:46:44,605
You've injured orderlies. Guards.
Other patients.

1335
01:46:44,685 --> 01:46:47,167
Two weeks ago
you attacked George Noyce.

1336
01:46:47,207 --> 01:46:48,689
No, no! I am fucking on to you doctor!

1337
01:46:48,889 --> 01:46:50,691
- You had Noyce beaten.
- Of course I didn't.

1338
01:46:50,891 --> 01:46:52,893
Give me one reason
why I would even touch him.

1339
01:46:53,013 --> 01:46:54,815
Because he called you Laeddis

1340
01:46:54,895 --> 01:46:57,097
and you do anything not to be him.

1341
01:46:58,419 --> 01:47:00,901
I have a transcript of that conversation
you had with Noyce yesterday.

1342
01:47:00,941 --> 01:47:05,106
This is about you and Laeddis.
That's all it's ever been about

1343
01:47:07,228 --> 01:47:09,710
No. No. He is saying that it's about
"me and Laeddis".

1344
01:47:09,750 --> 01:47:12,193
When you've asked him what happened
to his face,

1345
01:47:12,233 --> 01:47:14,515
said, and I quote again,
"You did this".

1346
01:47:15,036 --> 01:47:18,439
- No. He meant it was my fault he...
- You almost killed him.

1347
01:47:20,802 --> 01:47:24,445
The warden and the board of overseers
are determined something be done. It's been decided.

1348
01:47:25,326 --> 01:47:29,210
That unless, we can bring you back into sanity now,
right now,

1349
01:47:29,851 --> 01:47:32,734
permanent measures will be taken to ensure
you can't hurt anyone ever again.

1350
01:47:36,458 --> 01:47:38,660
They'll lobotomize you, Andrew.

1351
01:47:38,740 --> 01:47:40,141
Do you understand?

1352
01:47:44,025 --> 01:47:45,226
Yes, I understand.

1353
01:47:46,147 --> 01:47:48,029
I understand just fine.

1354
01:47:49,231 --> 01:47:53,115
If... if I don't play along
with your little game here.

1355
01:47:53,155 --> 01:47:55,677
Dr. Naehring is gonna turn me into
one of his ghosts.

1356
01:47:55,757 --> 01:47:57,279
What about my partner?

1357
01:47:57,959 --> 01:48:02,084
You're gonna tell the U.S. marshal's office
that he's a defense mechanism?

1358
01:48:04,086 --> 01:48:05,287
Hello, boss.

1359
01:48:23,105 --> 01:48:25,988
What the fuck is going on here?

1360
01:48:29,071 --> 01:48:30,593
You working for him?

1361
01:48:31,073 --> 01:48:35,998
I'm sorry about that
someone had to stick with you. Keep you safe.

1362
01:48:38,080 --> 01:48:39,922
You've been watching me, huh?

1363
01:48:40,603 --> 01:48:42,405
Watching me every minute.

1364
01:48:44,207 --> 01:48:45,528
Who... who are you?

1365
01:48:45,928 --> 01:48:47,210
Who are you?
Tell me.

1366
01:48:47,730 --> 01:48:49,412
Don't you recognize me, Andrew?

1367
01:48:51,214 --> 01:48:53,736
I've been you primary psychiatrist
for the last two years.

1368
01:48:55,018 --> 01:48:56,419
I am Lester Sheehan.

1369
01:49:02,425 --> 01:49:04,828
And I told you about my wife ...

1370
01:49:05,028 --> 01:49:08,031
- I know.
- I climbed down a cliff to get you.

1371
01:49:08,752 --> 01:49:12,676
I trusted you. I risked
everything to come in here after you. Everything!

1372
01:49:12,756 --> 01:49:13,797
I know, boss.

1373
01:49:13,837 --> 01:49:15,439
We're running out of time here, Andrew,

1374
01:49:16,840 --> 01:49:19,322
I swore before the entire board of
overseers that I could construct

1375
01:49:19,363 --> 01:49:21,765
The most radical, cutting edge role-play

1376
01:49:21,845 --> 01:49:24,328
ever attempted in psychiatry and
it would bring you back.

1377
01:49:24,368 --> 01:49:26,850
I thought if we let you play
this out

1378
01:49:27,571 --> 01:49:30,454
we could get you to see how
untrue, how impossible it is.

1379
01:49:32,136 --> 01:49:33,457
We've had to run of the place for two days.

1380
01:49:34,138 --> 01:49:36,860
Tell me, where are the Nazi experiments?

1381
01:49:37,781 --> 01:49:39,463
The satanic O.R.'s?

1382
01:49:52,196 --> 01:49:53,798
Andrew, listen to me.

1383
01:49:56,160 --> 01:49:57,682
If we fail with you

1384
01:49:58,883 --> 01:50:01,085
then everything we've tried
to do here will be discredited.

1385
01:50:01,205 --> 01:50:02,286
Everything.

1386
01:50:04,609 --> 01:50:06,771
We are on the front line of a war here, old boy.

1387
01:50:08,292 --> 01:50:10,615
And right now, it'll come down to you.

1388
01:50:17,302 --> 01:50:19,304
Don't move! Don't move!

1389
01:50:19,384 --> 01:50:22,387
- Andrew, no!
- My name is Edward Daniels.

1390
01:50:23,308 --> 01:50:26,031
This one is loaded.
I can tell by the weight.

1391
01:50:26,111 --> 01:50:28,113
I see. And that's your firearm marshal?
You're sure?

1392
01:50:28,633 --> 01:50:30,115
My initials are on the side and there's a dent in the 
barrel from when Philip Stacks shot at me. 

1393
01:50:30,195 --> 01:50:34,319
You're not going to fuck with my mind on this
one Doc

1394
01:50:34,359 --> 01:50:37,322
Then blast away, because that's the
only way you're ever getting off this island.

1395
01:50:43,929 --> 01:50:45,330
Andrew, please don't.

1396
01:50:56,061 --> 01:50:57,062
My gun...

1397
01:51:03,949 --> 01:51:05,471
What have you done to
my Goddamn gun.

1398
01:51:06,552 --> 01:51:08,033
It's a toy, Andrew.

1399
01:51:10,756 --> 01:51:12,278
We're telling you the truth.

1400
01:51:13,759 --> 01:51:16,963
Dolores was insane. Manic-depressive.
Suicidal.

1401
01:51:17,443 --> 01:51:20,526
You drank. Stayed away.
Ignored what everyone had told you.

1402
01:51:20,566 --> 01:51:23,449
You moved to that lake house after
she, purposely,

1403
01:51:23,569 --> 01:51:26,092
set your city apartment on fire

1404
01:51:26,252 --> 01:51:27,894
Andrew! Andrew!
Stop it!

1405
01:51:30,096 --> 01:51:31,097
You're lying...

1406
01:51:31,577 --> 01:51:33,259
Andrew, your children.

1407
01:51:34,100 --> 01:51:35,261
Simon...

1408
01:51:36,182 --> 01:51:38,785
- Henry...
- I didn't have any children.

1409
01:51:38,985 --> 01:51:40,386
Your wife drowned them.

1410
01:51:40,787 --> 01:51:43,269
At the cabin by the lake.

1411
01:51:43,389 --> 01:51:45,472
And here, the little girl,
the one you dream of

1412
01:51:46,112 --> 01:51:47,193
every night.

1413
01:51:47,914 --> 01:51:49,075
I never had a little.

1414
01:51:49,115 --> 01:51:52,999
The one who tells you over and over that
you should have saved her

1415
01:51:53,079 --> 01:51:54,201
Saved them all.

1416
01:51:54,801 --> 01:51:55,922
Your daughter...

1417
01:51:56,403 --> 01:51:59,286
Her name was Rachel. Are you going to deny
that she ever lived?

1418
01:52:00,527 --> 01:52:01,608
Andrew, are you?

1419
01:52:24,831 --> 01:52:26,232
I'm so sorry, baby...

1420
01:52:30,637 --> 01:52:32,439
I told you not to come in here.

1421
01:52:33,039 --> 01:52:34,320
I told you...

1422
01:52:35,161 --> 01:52:37,444
this would be the end of you.

1423
01:52:57,064 --> 01:52:59,466
I'm back.
We got him

1424
01:52:59,586 --> 01:53:02,069
just outside of Oklahoma.
Must of stopped ten places

1425
01:53:02,109 --> 01:53:05,072
in between here and Tulsa.
I could sleep for a week.

1426
01:53:09,396 --> 01:53:10,557
Dolores?

1427
01:53:17,565 --> 01:53:19,286
Dolores?

1428
01:53:24,092 --> 01:53:26,494
Dolores?

1429
01:53:39,308 --> 01:53:41,309
Dolores?

1430
01:54:05,333 --> 01:54:06,855
Baby...

1431
01:54:09,057 --> 01:54:10,338
why are you all wet?

1432
01:54:13,341 --> 01:54:14,743
I missed you.

1433
01:54:21,350 --> 01:54:24,353
I want to go home.

1434
01:54:24,873 --> 01:54:28,076
You are home!

1435
01:54:31,880 --> 01:54:33,882
Where are the kids?

1436
01:54:38,367 --> 01:54:40,649
They're in school.

1437
01:54:44,293 --> 01:54:46,295
It's Saturday, honey.

1438
01:54:46,776 --> 01:54:48,657
School's not in on Saturday.

1439
01:54:51,661 --> 01:54:53,062
My school is.

1440
01:55:05,915 --> 01:55:07,917
Oh my God!

1441
01:55:10,280 --> 01:55:11,601
My God!

1442
01:55:25,495 --> 01:55:27,337
God!

1443
01:55:30,020 --> 01:55:33,343
Oh my God, no!

1444
01:55:36,026 --> 01:55:37,627
Come on!
Come on!

1445
01:55:55,045 --> 01:55:57,448
Please, God, no.

1446
01:55:57,528 --> 01:56:01,051
No!

1447
01:56:01,852 --> 01:56:03,053
No!

1448
01:56:08,459 --> 01:56:09,580
No!

1449
01:56:12,063 --> 01:56:12,984
No!

1450
01:57:14,127 --> 01:57:16,408
Let's put them in the room.

1451
01:57:17,250 --> 01:57:19,531
We'll dry them off...

1452
01:57:20,052 --> 01:57:21,654
We'll change their clothes...

1453
01:57:23,415 --> 01:57:26,619
They'll be our living dolls.

1454
01:57:29,542 --> 01:57:31,063
Tomorrow we can take them on a picnic.

1455
01:57:37,630 --> 01:57:39,151
If you ever loved me, Dolores...

1456
01:57:39,632 --> 01:57:41,354
Please stop talking.

1457
01:57:46,760 --> 01:57:49,282
I love you.

1458
01:57:57,570 --> 01:57:59,172
Set me free!

1459
01:58:04,577 --> 01:58:05,458
Honey...

1460
01:58:07,101 --> 01:58:09,703
We'll give them baths...

1461
01:58:16,870 --> 01:58:18,792
- I love you so much, Dolores.
- And I love you. I love you.

1462
01:58:48,824 --> 01:58:51,025
Andrew...

1463
01:58:52,546 --> 01:58:54,148
Andrew, can you hear me?

1464
01:58:55,910 --> 01:58:58,953
Rachel!
Rachel, Rachel...

1465
01:59:00,955 --> 01:59:01,956
Rachel.

1466
01:59:04,318 --> 01:59:05,840
Rachel who?

1467
01:59:09,444 --> 01:59:10,445
Rachel Laeddis...

1468
01:59:12,046 --> 01:59:13,167
My daughter.

1469
01:59:16,931 --> 01:59:18,453
Why are you here?

1470
01:59:21,776 --> 01:59:23,378
Because I killed my wife.

1471
01:59:23,658 --> 01:59:24,939
and why did you do that?

1472
01:59:29,665 --> 01:59:32,467
Dhe murdered our children.

1473
01:59:33,669 --> 01:59:36,271
And she told me to let her go.

1474
01:59:39,275 --> 01:59:43,398
- Who is Teddy Daniels?
- He doesn't exist.

1475
01:59:44,480 --> 01:59:46,282
Neither does Rachel Solando.
I made them up.

1476
01:59:47,003 --> 01:59:48,684
Why?

1477
01:59:49,485 --> 01:59:51,767
We need to hear you say it.

1478
01:59:57,494 --> 02:00:00,376
After she tried to kill
herself the first time,

1479
02:00:01,898 --> 02:00:03,099
Dolores told me she...

1480
02:00:04,701 --> 02:00:06,303
she had an insect...

1481
02:00:07,904 --> 02:00:09,226
living inside her brain.

1482
02:00:10,827 --> 02:00:11,588
She could feel it...

1483
02:00:14,311 --> 02:00:15,912
clicking across
her skull...

1484
02:00:17,995 --> 02:00:20,517
pulling the wires,
just for fun.

1485
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:25,122
She told me that.

1486
02:00:26,003 --> 02:00:28,005
She told me but I didn't listen.

1487
02:00:33,249 --> 02:00:34,931
I loved her so much.

1488
02:00:37,133 --> 02:00:38,454
Why did you make them up?

1489
02:00:40,737 --> 02:00:43,940
Because I can't take knowing
that Dolores killed our children.

1490
02:00:51,828 --> 02:00:55,672
I killed them, because
I didn't get her help.

1491
02:01:00,007 --> 02:01:02,960
I killed them...

1492
02:01:06,563 --> 02:01:10,487
Here's my theory, Andrew.
we broke through once before,

1493
02:01:10,567 --> 02:01:13,290
nine months ago,
and then you regressed.

1494
02:01:15,053 --> 02:01:18,176
- I don't remember that.
- I know.

1495
02:01:19,296 --> 02:01:22,379
You reset, Andrew.
Like a tape

1496
02:01:22,499 --> 02:01:26,583
playing over and over on an endless loop.

1497
02:01:26,784 --> 02:01:29,707
I hope that what we've done will be enough
to stop it from ever happening again

1498
02:01:29,707 --> 02:01:32,189
But I need to know ...

1499
02:01:32,229 --> 02:01:34,712
you have accepted the reality.

1500
02:01:40,798 --> 02:01:43,801
You came after me, huh, doctor?

1501
02:01:46,604 --> 02:01:49,407
You tried to help me when no one else would.

1502
02:02:00,818 --> 02:02:03,221
My name is Andrew Laeddis...

1503
02:02:09,227 --> 02:02:13,351
And I murdered my wife
in the spring of '52.

1504
02:02:36,935 --> 02:02:38,777
How we doing this morning?

1505
02:02:39,258 --> 02:02:40,779
Good.
And You?

1506
02:02:40,939 --> 02:02:42,941
Can't complain.

1507
02:02:51,391 --> 02:02:52,993
So what's our next move?

1508
02:02:53,753 --> 02:02:55,075
You tell me.

1509
02:03:00,480 --> 02:03:02,082
I've gotta get off this rock,
Chuck.

1510
02:03:04,483 --> 02:03:07,767
Get back to the mainland. Whatever the
hell is going on here. It's bad.

1511
02:03:28,189 --> 02:03:30,311
Don't worry, partner.
They're not gonna catch us.

1512
02:03:37,917 --> 02:03:39,319
That's right. We're too smart for them.

1513
02:03:41,441 --> 02:03:43,123
Yeah, we are.
Aren't we?

1514
02:03:58,019 --> 02:04:00,621
You know this place makes
me wonder.

1515
02:04:01,542 --> 02:04:03,063
Yeah? What's that boss?

1516
02:04:04,745 --> 02:04:06,146
Which would be worse?

1517
02:04:07,548 --> 02:04:08,149
To live as a monster ...

1518
02:04:08,830 --> 02:04:11,072
or to die as a good man.

1519
02:04:19,561 --> 02:04:21,482
Teddy?
