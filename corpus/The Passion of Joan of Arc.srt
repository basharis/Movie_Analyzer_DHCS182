00:02:03,871 --> 00:02:09,832
THE PASSION OF JOAN OF ARC

2
00:02:10,511 --> 00:02:16,381
A film by Carl Th. Dreyer

3
00:03:00,928 --> 00:03:03,761
At the Bibliotheque de la
Chambre des Deputes in Paris

4
00:03:03,931 --> 00:03:07,094
resides one of the most
extraordinary documents

5
00:03:07,268 --> 00:03:09,862
in the history of the world:
the record of the trial of

6
00:03:10,037 --> 00:03:13,200
Joan of Arc, the trial
that ended in her death.

7
00:03:23,217 --> 00:03:26,812
The questions of the judges
and Joan's responses

8
00:03:26,988 --> 00:03:30,424
were recorded exactly.

9
00:03:33,327 --> 00:03:37,229
Reading it, we discover
the real Joan...

10
00:03:37,398 --> 00:03:40,390
not in armor,
but simple and human...

11
00:03:40,535 --> 00:03:43,003
a young woman who died
for her country...

12
00:03:46,474 --> 00:03:49,034
and we are witness to an
amazing drama:

13
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:52,338
a young, pious woman
confronted by a group

14
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:56,047
of orthodox theologians and
powerful judges.

15
00:05:29,677 --> 00:05:32,908
I swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth...

16
00:05:34,982 --> 00:05:37,280
nothing but the truth...

17
00:05:59,674 --> 00:06:02,768
In France I'm called Joan...

18
00:06:11,852 --> 00:06:14,946
in my village,
I'm called Jeannette.

19
00:06:20,194 --> 00:06:22,185
How old are you?

20
00:06:32,139 --> 00:06:35,131
Nineteen...I think.

21
00:06:43,951 --> 00:06:46,385
Do you know the Lord's Prayer?

22
00:06:51,826 --> 00:06:54,090
Who taught it to you?

23
00:07:15,182 --> 00:07:16,672
My mother.

24
00:07:24,925 --> 00:07:27,189
Will you recite it?

25
00:07:44,111 --> 00:07:46,807
You claim to be sent by God?

26
00:07:58,492 --> 00:08:00,551
To save France...

27
00:08:07,601 --> 00:08:10,001
it's why I was born.

28
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,376
So you think God hates
the English?

29
00:08:37,097 --> 00:08:41,727
I don't know if God loves
or hates the English...

30
00:08:48,042 --> 00:08:52,001
but I do know that the English
will all be chased from France...

31
00:09:13,901 --> 00:09:15,994
except those that die here!

32
00:09:47,535 --> 00:09:52,199
You have said that St. Michael
appeared to you...in what form?

33
00:09:57,811 --> 00:09:59,676
Did he have wings?

34
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:05,177
Did he wear a crown?

35
00:10:13,193 --> 00:10:15,559
How was he dressed?

36
00:10:32,713 --> 00:10:36,581
How did you know if it was
a man or a woman?

37
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:44,387
Was he naked?

38
00:10:56,470 --> 00:11:00,031
Do you think God was unable
to clothe him?

39
00:11:07,948 --> 00:11:10,007
Did he have long hair?

40
00:11:18,092 --> 00:11:20,322
Why would he have cut it?

41
00:11:28,035 --> 00:11:31,266
Why do you wear men's clothing?

42
00:11:36,877 --> 00:11:40,438
If we give you women's clothing,
would you wear it?

43
00:11:58,032 --> 00:12:01,263
When the mission that God has
entrusted to me is over...

44
00:12:01,402 --> 00:12:03,632
I will again dress as a woman.

45
00:12:45,779 --> 00:12:49,510
So it is God who orders you
to dress as a man?

46
00:13:01,161 --> 00:13:05,063
And what reward do you
expect from God?

47
00:13:17,945 --> 00:13:19,913
The salvation of my soul.

48
00:13:28,956 --> 00:13:30,924
You blaspheme God.

49
00:13:59,086 --> 00:14:00,678
This is disgraceful.

50
00:14:05,225 --> 00:14:07,352
For me, she is a saint.

51
00:16:45,385 --> 00:16:47,819
Has God made you promises?

52
00:17:06,373 --> 00:17:09,171
That has nothing to do
with this trial.

53
00:17:18,618 --> 00:17:21,348
Shouldn't we let the judges
decide that?

54
00:17:26,893 --> 00:17:30,021
Shall we put this question
to a vote?

55
00:17:56,656 --> 00:17:59,716
So! What has God promised you?

56
00:18:01,661 --> 00:18:05,153
Perhaps that you will be
delivered from prison?

57
00:18:14,508 --> 00:18:16,032
When?

58
00:18:31,825 --> 00:18:33,816
I know neither the day...

59
00:18:39,232 --> 00:18:40,722
nor the hour.

60
00:19:14,334 --> 00:19:17,599
Since she couldn't be made
to confess easily...

61
00:19:17,737 --> 00:19:20,205
we will have to be clever...

62
00:19:31,418 --> 00:19:35,684
Go find a letter bearing the
signature of King Charles.

63
00:19:44,998 --> 00:19:48,161
I will dictate a letter.

64
00:22:34,601 --> 00:22:36,933
I have great sympathy for you!

65
00:23:05,298 --> 00:23:08,699
Do you know the signature
of your King?

66
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:26,683
I have a letter from him
for you.

67
00:23:45,372 --> 00:23:47,363
I can't read.

68
00:23:52,045 --> 00:23:54,843
To our beloved Joan...

69
00:24:03,022 --> 00:24:07,459
I am preparing to march on Rouen
with a mighty army.

70
00:24:11,398 --> 00:24:13,662
I send you this devoted priest.

71
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,631
Have confidence in him.

72
00:25:04,184 --> 00:25:06,379
Just as Jesus
is the son of God...

73
00:25:06,519 --> 00:25:08,851
you claim to be
the daughter of God?

74
00:25:13,893 --> 00:25:17,420
Will you recite the
Lord's Prayer?

75
00:25:56,736 --> 00:26:00,672
God has told you that you shall
be delivered from prison?

76
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:19,081
By a great victory!

77
00:27:01,034 --> 00:27:04,561
God has promised you that
you will go to Heaven?

78
00:27:23,289 --> 00:27:25,655
So you are certain of
being saved?

79
00:27:42,475 --> 00:27:45,672
Be careful,
it's a dangerous answer.

80
00:28:12,472 --> 00:28:15,032
Since you are sure of
your salvation...

81
00:28:15,174 --> 00:28:17,642
you have no need of the Church?

82
00:28:41,668 --> 00:28:43,829
Are you in a state of grace?

83
00:29:22,709 --> 00:29:25,803
Respond!
Are you in a state of grace?

84
00:29:45,832 --> 00:29:48,960
If I am, may God keep me there.

85
00:29:56,209 --> 00:29:59,440
If I am not,
may God grant it to me!

86
00:30:25,538 --> 00:30:26,971
Father...

87
00:30:35,348 --> 00:30:38,078
permit me to attend Mass.

88
00:31:16,689 --> 00:31:19,715
Joan, if we permit you
to attend Mass...

89
00:31:23,729 --> 00:31:26,789
will you stop wearing
men's clothes?

90
00:31:53,893 --> 00:31:57,795
So, you would rather dress
as a man than attend Mass?

91
00:32:02,902 --> 00:32:04,893
These shameless clothes...

92
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:12,775
abominable to God...

93
00:32:29,929 --> 00:32:32,227
You are no daughter of God...

94
00:32:35,167 --> 00:32:37,397
You are Satan's creature!

95
00:32:43,609 --> 00:32:45,941
Go prepare the torture chamber.

96
00:34:42,061 --> 00:34:44,723
She really looks like
a daughter of God, eh?

97
00:35:32,511 --> 00:35:34,809
The torture chamber.

98
00:36:10,549 --> 00:36:12,540
Regard your judges.

99
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:24,288
Do you not feel that these
learned doctors

100
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:26,523
are wiser than you?

101
00:36:34,306 --> 00:36:36,774
But God is even wiser!

102
00:36:47,219 --> 00:36:51,986
Listen, Joan, we know that your
visions do not come from God...

103
00:36:56,195 --> 00:36:58,163
but from the devil.

104
00:37:09,675 --> 00:37:13,441
How do you know a good angel
from an evil angel?

105
00:37:22,421 --> 00:37:27,484
You have knelt before Satan,
not St. Michael!

106
00:37:37,736 --> 00:37:39,897
Don't you see
that it's the Devil

107
00:37:40,072 --> 00:37:42,006
who has turned your head...

108
00:37:46,345 --> 00:37:48,245
who has tricked you...

109
00:37:51,951 --> 00:37:53,543
and betrayed you?

110
00:38:07,499 --> 00:38:11,026
I think she's ready to abjure!

111
00:39:03,989 --> 00:39:06,321
The Church opens its arms
to you...

112
00:39:12,831 --> 00:39:15,732
but if you reject it,
the Church will abandon you...

113
00:39:15,868 --> 00:39:17,597
and you will be alone...

114
00:39:21,307 --> 00:39:22,865
alone!

115
00:39:25,711 --> 00:39:27,611
Yes, alone...

116
00:39:32,384 --> 00:39:34,443
alone, with God!

117
00:40:55,667 --> 00:40:58,465
Even if you part my soul
from my body...

118
00:40:58,604 --> 00:41:00,401
I will confess nothing...

119
00:41:05,144 --> 00:41:08,375
And if I do confess,
later I will say

120
00:41:08,514 --> 00:41:10,846
it was forced from me!

121
00:42:27,693 --> 00:42:30,127
Not for anything in the world
do I want her to die

122
00:42:30,262 --> 00:42:31,695
a natural death.

123
00:42:39,304 --> 00:42:40,828
She is very weak.

124
00:42:47,379 --> 00:42:50,439
She has a fever...
we must bleed her.

125
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:57,780
Be careful, she could end
her own life...

126
00:42:57,923 --> 00:42:59,754
she's very crafty.

127
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:57,246
Bring the Sacraments.

128
00:44:51,103 --> 00:44:53,401
Is there something
you wish to tell us?

129
00:45:05,550 --> 00:45:08,713
I fear that I am about to die...

130
00:45:16,161 --> 00:45:20,495
and if I do, I ask you to
bury me in sacred ground.

131
00:45:32,778 --> 00:45:35,440
The Church is merciful...

132
00:45:42,521 --> 00:45:45,649
It always welcomes
the misguided lamb.

133
00:46:05,077 --> 00:46:08,171
Joan, we all want what's
best for you.

134
00:46:08,313 --> 00:46:10,747
Look, I have sent
for the Sacraments.

135
00:46:51,089 --> 00:46:53,580
I am a good Christian.

136
00:47:53,285 --> 00:47:57,654
Do you not know it is the
Body of Christ you refuse?

137
00:48:04,830 --> 00:48:09,597
Do you not see that you
outrage God by your obstinacy?

138
00:49:00,752 --> 00:49:03,846
I love and honor God...
with all my heart.

139
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:45,521
You claim...that I am...
sent by the devil.

140
00:49:55,140 --> 00:49:56,937
It's not true...

141
00:50:00,712 --> 00:50:04,842
to make me suffer,
the devil has sent you...

142
00:50:09,254 --> 00:50:10,687
and you...

143
00:50:13,692 --> 00:50:15,216
and you...

144
00:50:17,829 --> 00:50:19,421
and you...

145
00:50:33,378 --> 00:50:35,437
There is nothing left
to be done...

146
00:50:35,580 --> 00:50:37,207
alert the executioner!

147
00:52:11,876 --> 00:52:15,778
Let us try one last time
to save this lost soul...

148
00:52:40,872 --> 00:52:43,602
It is to you, Joan,
that I speak.

149
00:52:47,846 --> 00:52:51,111
It is to you that I say
your King is a heretic!

150
00:52:55,587 --> 00:52:59,523
My King is the most noble
Christian of all.

151
00:53:12,303 --> 00:53:15,397
The arrogance of this woman
is insane.

152
00:54:22,674 --> 00:54:26,110
France has never seen
such a monster...

153
00:54:38,156 --> 00:54:41,284
I have never wronged anyone.

154
00:54:54,372 --> 00:54:57,933
If you do not sign,
you will be burned alive...

155
00:55:01,446 --> 00:55:04,006
The stake awaits you...

156
00:55:17,729 --> 00:55:22,291
You don't have the right to die.
Your King still needs you.

157
00:55:40,585 --> 00:55:43,645
Joan, sign...
and save your life!

158
00:55:50,762 --> 00:55:53,697
Joan, we have great
sympathy for you.

159
00:56:00,471 --> 00:56:02,371
Sign, Joan!

160
00:57:37,602 --> 00:57:39,934
In the name of the Lord. Amen.

161
00:57:48,279 --> 00:57:51,214
Having recognized your errors,

162
00:57:51,349 --> 00:57:53,783
you shall not be excommunicated.

163
00:58:01,259 --> 00:58:05,355
But as you have greatly sinned,
we condemn you...

164
00:58:14,071 --> 00:58:16,835
to perpetual imprisonment,
to eat the bread of sorrow

165
00:58:16,974 --> 00:58:19,374
and drink the water of anguish.

166
00:58:29,387 --> 00:58:32,151
A good day's work:
you have saved

167
00:58:32,323 --> 00:58:34,382
your life and your soul.

168
00:59:07,925 --> 00:59:10,655
She has only made fools of you!

169
00:59:16,834 --> 00:59:18,631
Long live Joan!

170
01:01:10,715 --> 01:01:13,115
Go find the judges!

171
01:01:16,187 --> 01:01:18,849
I take it back, I have lied...

172
01:01:21,692 --> 01:01:23,387
Hurry!

173
01:02:08,606 --> 01:02:10,836
I have committed a great sin...

174
01:02:34,065 --> 01:02:36,829
I have denied God...
to save my life.

175
01:02:42,573 --> 01:02:45,542
But Joan, you have confessed
before everyone

176
01:02:45,676 --> 01:02:48,236
that the devil misled you.

177
01:03:02,393 --> 01:03:05,954
You still believe you were
sent by God?

178
01:03:24,548 --> 01:03:27,176
Her answer will bring her death.

179
01:04:02,453 --> 01:04:05,479
Everything I said was for
fear of the stake.

180
01:04:15,299 --> 01:04:17,665
Have you anything else
to tell us?

181
01:05:39,316 --> 01:05:42,649
We have come to prepare you
for death.

182
01:05:57,067 --> 01:05:59,535
Now...already?

183
01:06:09,780 --> 01:06:11,270
How am I to die?

184
01:06:16,220 --> 01:06:18,245
At the stake.

185
01:06:29,566 --> 01:06:31,761
I'll bring the last Sacrament.

186
01:06:40,210 --> 01:06:45,170
How can you still believe
that you are sent by God?

187
01:06:50,421 --> 01:06:53,151
His ways are not our ways.

188
01:07:04,201 --> 01:07:06,465
Yes, I am His child.

189
01:07:17,614 --> 01:07:20,014
And the great victory?

190
01:07:28,993 --> 01:07:30,927
...my martyrdom!

191
01:07:36,266 --> 01:07:38,257
...and your deliverance?

192
01:07:58,555 --> 01:08:00,079
...death!

193
01:08:23,047 --> 01:08:25,038
Will you take confession?

194
01:09:34,118 --> 01:09:39,055
May the Body of Our Lord
Jesus Christ keep my soul...

195
01:09:53,804 --> 01:09:56,967
unto life everlasting. Amen.

196
01:11:05,409 --> 01:11:09,869
Be courageous, Joan.
Your last hour approaches.

197
01:12:33,130 --> 01:12:37,066
Dear God, I accept
my death gladly...

198
01:12:55,385 --> 01:12:59,014
but do not let me suffer
too long.

199
01:13:03,927 --> 01:13:07,522
Will I be with You tonight
in Paradise?

200
01:18:07,030 --> 01:18:08,895
Jesus!

201
01:18:17,007 --> 01:18:19,305
You have burned a saint!

202
01:21:16,920 --> 01:21:20,481
The flames sheltered
Joan's soul...

203
01:21:20,623 --> 01:21:23,592
as it rose to heaven -

204
01:21:23,726 --> 01:21:27,059
Joan whose heart has become
the heart of France...

205
01:21:27,197 --> 01:21:29,961
Joan, whose memory
will always be cherished...

206
01:21:30,099 --> 01:21:32,294
by the people of France.
