1
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:20,581
Even if you accept the belief that the
high Trendex means a rising sales curve...

2
00:02:20,748 --> 00:02:22,040
- Mr. Thornhill.
- Good night.

3
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:24,668
- Say hello to the missus.
- We're not talking.

4
00:02:24,836 --> 00:02:26,545
My recommendation is still the same.

5
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:29,756
Spread the good word
in as many small-time segments as we can.

6
00:02:29,924 --> 00:02:33,886
Let the opposition have their high ratings
while we cry all the way to the bank.

7
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:36,221
Why don't we colonize
at the Colony next week?

8
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:39,016
Let me hear from you, Sam.
Uh, happy thoughts, et cetera.

9
00:02:39,184 --> 00:02:40,642
You better walk me to the Plaza.

10
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:43,729
I didn't put a coat on.
- Use your blood sugar, child. Come on.

11
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:45,647
- Next?
- Gretchen Sabinson.

12
00:02:45,815 --> 00:02:49,151
Oh, yes. Send her a box of candy
from Blum's, $10. You know the kind.

13
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:51,653
Each piece wrapped in gold paper.
She'll like that.

14
00:02:51,821 --> 00:02:53,280
She'll think she's eating money.

15
00:02:53,448 --> 00:02:56,116
Just say to her:
"Darling, I count the days, the hours... "

16
00:02:56,284 --> 00:02:58,160
- You sent that one last time.
- I did?

17
00:02:58,328 --> 00:03:02,372
Well, put: "Something for your sweet tooth,
baby, and all your other sweet parts. "

18
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:04,625
- I know.
- Could we take a cab, Mr. Thornhill?

19
00:03:04,792 --> 00:03:06,835
- For two blocks?
- You're late and I'm tired.

20
00:03:07,003 --> 00:03:09,546
That's your trouble, Maggie,
you don't eat properly.

21
00:03:09,714 --> 00:03:11,173
Here. Taxi.

22
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:14,301
I have a very sick woman here.
You don't mind, do you?

23
00:03:14,469 --> 00:03:15,928
- Well, no.
Thank you very much.

24
00:03:16,095 --> 00:03:17,137
Perfectly all right.

25
00:03:17,972 --> 00:03:21,183
- First stop, the Plaza. Don't throw the flag.
- Poor man.

26
00:03:21,351 --> 00:03:23,435
Oh, come, come, come.
I made him a happy man.

27
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:27,814
- I made him feel like a good Samaritan.
- He knew you were lying.

28
00:03:27,982 --> 00:03:31,151
Ah, in the world of advertising,
there's no such thing as a lie.

29
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:35,280
There's only the expedient exaggeration.
You ought to know that.

30
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:38,283
- Say, do I look heavyish to you?
- What?

31
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:39,868
I feel heavyish.

32
00:03:40,036 --> 00:03:42,537
Put a note on my desk in the morning:
"Think thin. "

33
00:03:42,705 --> 00:03:44,498
"Think thin. "

34
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:47,584
- Better make it the 59th Street entrance.
- Okay.

35
00:03:48,336 --> 00:03:50,462
Oh. Soon as you get back,
call my mother.

36
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:53,173
Remind her we've got those theater tickets
for tonight.

37
00:03:53,341 --> 00:03:55,092
Dinner at 21, 7:00.

38
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:59,179
I'll have had two martinis at the Oak Bar,
so she needn't bother to sniff my breath.

39
00:03:59,347 --> 00:04:02,182
- She doesn't do that.
- Sure she does. Like a bloodhound.

40
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:05,852
Bigelow at 10:30 is your first tomorrow,
the Skin Glow rehearsal at noon...

41
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:08,021
...then lunch with Falcon and his wife.

42
00:04:08,189 --> 00:04:10,482
- Oh, yeah. Where was that?
- Larry and Arnold's, 1:00.

43
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,609
- Oh.
- Will you check in later?

44
00:04:12,777 --> 00:04:13,819
Absolutely not.

45
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:17,739
Here, driver, take this lady
back where she belongs.

46
00:04:17,907 --> 00:04:19,908
- Right.
- That ought to cover it.

47
00:04:20,785 --> 00:04:23,161
- Don't forget, call my mother right away.
- I won't.

48
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:26,206
- Good night, Mr. Thornhill.
- Good night, sweetie.

49
00:04:28,876 --> 00:04:32,045
Oh, wait, Maggie. You can't call her.
She's at Mrs...

50
00:04:54,068 --> 00:04:55,402
- Good evening.
Good evening.

51
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:57,988
I'm looking for Mr. Weltner
and two other gentlemen.

52
00:04:58,156 --> 00:04:59,906
Yes, sir. Right this way.

53
00:05:01,159 --> 00:05:02,200
Herman.
- Roger.

54
00:05:02,368 --> 00:05:04,036
- I'm a little late.
- Roger Thornhill.

55
00:05:04,203 --> 00:05:05,662
- Fanning Nelson.
- How do you do?

56
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:07,372
- How do you do?
- Larry Wade.

57
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:10,584
- We got a little head start here.
- Oh, that won't last long.

58
00:05:10,752 --> 00:05:15,255
I was telling Larry and Fanning you may be
slow on starting but there's nobody faster.

59
00:05:15,423 --> 00:05:18,842
- What's the matter? You've got the fidgets.
- I just did something stupid.

60
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:22,596
I told my secretary to call Mother.
I realized she won't be able to reach her.

61
00:05:22,764 --> 00:05:25,724
Why not?
- She's playing bridge at one of her cronies'.

62
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:28,310
- Your secretary?
- No. My mother.

63
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:31,521
One of those new apartments.
Wet paint and no telephone yet.

64
00:05:31,689 --> 00:05:33,940
George Kaplan.
- Perhaps if I send her a telegram.

65
00:05:34,108 --> 00:05:35,734
- Mr. George Kaplan?
Boy.

66
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:44,326
- Kaplan.
- I've got to get off a wire immediately.

67
00:05:44,494 --> 00:05:46,787
Could you send it for me
if I write it out for you?

68
00:05:46,954 --> 00:05:49,456
Oh, I'm not permitted to do that, sir,
but if you'll follow me.

69
00:05:49,624 --> 00:05:52,459
- Oh. Will you excuse me, gentlemen?
- Go right ahead.

70
00:05:55,963 --> 00:05:57,839
- Right through there, sir.
- Yeah, thanks.

71
00:05:58,007 --> 00:05:59,674
Thank you, sir.

72
00:06:01,636 --> 00:06:03,136
Wait, what's that supposed to be?

73
00:06:03,304 --> 00:06:06,765
The car's waiting outside.
You will walk between us saying nothing.

74
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:09,101
- What are you talking about?
- Let's go.

75
00:06:09,268 --> 00:06:12,312
Let's go where? Who...? Who are you?

76
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,564
Mere errand boys
carrying concealed weapons.

77
00:06:14,732 --> 00:06:18,693
His is pointed at your heart. So, please,
no errors of judgment, I beg of you.

78
00:06:18,861 --> 00:06:20,654
What is this, a joke or something?

79
00:06:20,822 --> 00:06:24,157
- Yes, a joke. We will laugh in the car.
- Come.

80
00:06:24,325 --> 00:06:25,826
But this is ridiculous.

81
00:06:46,931 --> 00:06:49,975
Don't tell me where we're going,
surprise me.

82
00:06:51,853 --> 00:06:54,521
You know, I left some friends back there
in the Oak Bar.

83
00:06:54,689 --> 00:06:56,565
They're going to think I'm awfully rude.

84
00:06:56,732 --> 00:06:59,526
I mean, uh, couldn't we stop off
at a drugstore for a moment...

85
00:06:59,694 --> 00:07:03,947
...so that I could explain
I'm being, uh, kidnapped?

86
00:07:04,115 --> 00:07:06,700
Well, that is what's happening, isn't it?

87
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:17,419
Locked.

88
00:07:30,057 --> 00:07:32,058
Who's Townsend?

89
00:07:33,769 --> 00:07:35,353
Really?

90
00:07:35,521 --> 00:07:37,230
Interesting.

91
00:08:21,442 --> 00:08:23,193
- Where is he?
- Upstairs, dressing.

92
00:08:23,361 --> 00:08:25,779
- Tell him I'm here.
- The dinner guests are expected.

93
00:08:25,947 --> 00:08:27,989
Never mind that. Say to him: "Kaplan. "

94
00:08:28,157 --> 00:08:30,408
By the way,
what are we having for dessert?

95
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:32,160
- Is anyone in the library?
- No.

96
00:08:32,328 --> 00:08:33,787
This way.

97
00:08:44,966 --> 00:08:46,132
You will wait here.

98
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:49,219
Well, don't hurry.
I'll catch up on my reading.

99
00:09:31,929 --> 00:09:32,971
Good evening.

100
00:09:56,537 --> 00:09:59,581
Not what I expected. A little taller.

101
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:02,375
A little more polished than the others.

102
00:10:03,252 --> 00:10:06,212
Oh, I'm so glad you're pleased,
Mr. Townsend.

103
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:09,716
But I'm afraid just as obvious.

104
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:13,178
What the devil is all this about?
Why was I brought here?

105
00:10:15,389 --> 00:10:17,891
Games? Must we?

106
00:10:19,143 --> 00:10:20,894
Not that I mind a case of abduction...

107
00:10:21,062 --> 00:10:23,688
...but I have tickets
for the theater this evening.

108
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:28,401
To a show I was looking forward to. And I
get unreasonable about things like that.

109
00:10:28,569 --> 00:10:32,530
With such expert play-acting,
you make this very room a theater.

110
00:10:33,658 --> 00:10:37,160
Oh, Leonard,
have you met our distinguished guest?

111
00:10:38,746 --> 00:10:40,538
He's a well-tailored one, isn't he?

112
00:10:41,082 --> 00:10:44,584
My secretary is a great admirer
of your methods, Mr. Kaplan.

113
00:10:44,752 --> 00:10:48,838
- Elusiveness, however misguided...
- Wait a minute. Wait, wait.

114
00:10:49,006 --> 00:10:51,966
- Did you call me "Kaplan"?
- I know you're a man of many names...

115
00:10:52,134 --> 00:10:54,844
...but I'm perfectly willing to accept
your current choice.

116
00:10:55,012 --> 00:10:56,179
Current choice?

117
00:10:56,347 --> 00:10:59,641
My name is Thornhill. Roger Thornhill.
It's never been anything else.

118
00:10:59,809 --> 00:11:01,351
Of course.

119
00:11:01,936 --> 00:11:05,730
Your friends picked up the wrong package
when they bundled me out here in the car.

120
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:07,774
Do sit down, Mr. Kaplan.

121
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:11,361
I told you, I'm not Kaplan,
whoever he is. I'm...

122
00:11:11,529 --> 00:11:13,071
- Excuse me.
Yes?

123
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:14,447
The guests are here, dear.

124
00:11:14,615 --> 00:11:17,784
Look after them.
I'll be with you in a few minutes.

125
00:11:19,578 --> 00:11:21,621
Now, shall we get down to business?

126
00:11:21,789 --> 00:11:22,956
I'm all for that.

127
00:11:23,124 --> 00:11:26,459
Simply, I'd like you to tell me
how much you know of our arrangements...

128
00:11:26,627 --> 00:11:28,753
...and how you've come by
this information.

129
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:31,464
- I don't expect to get this for nothing.
- Of course not.

130
00:11:31,632 --> 00:11:35,093
Don't misunderstand, I don't expect you
to fall in with this suggestion...

131
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:39,764
...but the least I can do is afford you
the opportunity of surviving the evening.

132
00:11:42,977 --> 00:11:44,936
What the devil is that supposed to mean?

133
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:47,731
Why don't you surprise me,
Mr. Kaplan, and say yes?

134
00:11:47,898 --> 00:11:50,734
I've already told you...
- We know where you're headed for.

135
00:11:50,901 --> 00:11:51,985
I know where I'm headed.

136
00:11:52,153 --> 00:11:56,489
I'm headed for the Winter Garden Theater in
New York, and I think I'd better get going.

137
00:12:04,999 --> 00:12:07,125
Townsend,
you're making a serious mistake.

138
00:12:07,543 --> 00:12:11,337
This is not going to lead
to a very happy conclusion, Mr. Kaplan.

139
00:12:11,505 --> 00:12:14,507
I'm not Kaplan.
- I do wish you'd reconsider.

140
00:12:14,675 --> 00:12:19,262
We also know your contact in Pittsburgh
since Jason committed suicide.

141
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:22,682
What contact?
I've never even been in Pittsburgh.

142
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:26,686
On June the 16th, you checked
into the Sherwyn Hotel in Pittsburgh...

143
00:12:26,854 --> 00:12:29,814
...as Mr. George Kaplan
of Berkeley, California.

144
00:12:29,982 --> 00:12:32,859
A week later, you registered
at the Benjamin Franklin Hotel...

145
00:12:33,027 --> 00:12:34,778
...as Mr. George Kaplan of Pittsburgh.

146
00:12:34,945 --> 00:12:37,363
On August 11th,
you stayed at the Statler in Boston.

147
00:12:37,531 --> 00:12:41,201
August the 29th, George Kaplan of Boston
registered at the Whittier in Detroit.

148
00:12:41,368 --> 00:12:43,536
At present, you are registered
in room 796...

149
00:12:43,704 --> 00:12:46,790
...at the Plaza Hotel in New York
as Mr. George Kaplan of Detroit.

150
00:12:46,957 --> 00:12:48,041
- Really?
- In two days...

151
00:12:48,209 --> 00:12:51,461
...you are due at the Ambassador East
in Chicago.

152
00:12:51,629 --> 00:12:55,298
And then at the Sheraton-Johnson Hotel
in Rapid City, South Dakota.

153
00:12:55,466 --> 00:12:57,383
- Not me.
- There's very little sense...

154
00:12:57,551 --> 00:13:01,387
...in maintaining that you're deceiving us
any more than we're deceiving you.

155
00:13:01,555 --> 00:13:04,557
I don't suppose it would do any good
to show you ID cards...

156
00:13:04,725 --> 00:13:08,812
...a driver's license, things like that?
- They provide you with such good ones.

157
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:12,357
It's getting late. I have guests.

158
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:15,944
Do you intend to cooperate with us?
I'd like a simple yes or no.

159
00:13:16,111 --> 00:13:17,320
A simple no.

160
00:13:17,488 --> 00:13:21,407
For the simple reason I simply don't know
what you're talking about.

161
00:13:25,412 --> 00:13:27,455
Give Mr. Kaplan a drink, Leonard.

162
00:13:27,623 --> 00:13:29,332
A pleasant journey, sir.

163
00:13:40,636 --> 00:13:47,016
- Scotch? Rye? Bourbon? Vodka?
- Nothing. I'll take a quick ride back to town.

164
00:13:47,184 --> 00:13:48,935
Oh, that has been arranged.

165
00:13:49,103 --> 00:13:52,438
But first, a libation.

166
00:13:52,606 --> 00:13:53,690
Bourbon.

167
00:13:54,275 --> 00:13:57,193
You drink it.
I've had enough stimulation for one day.

168
00:13:57,361 --> 00:14:02,532
It'll be easier if you take this yourself.
Otherwise, it'll be necessary for us to insist.

169
00:14:15,963 --> 00:14:17,630
Cheers.

170
00:15:05,804 --> 00:15:08,097
Don't worry about me, fellas.
I'll take the bus.

171
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:01,354
Thanks for the lift, fellas.

172
00:18:01,522 --> 00:18:04,232
I want this man examined for driving
while intoxicated.

173
00:18:04,399 --> 00:18:05,691
- Really?
- Yeah.

174
00:18:05,859 --> 00:18:09,612
You see, they tried to kill me.
He won't listen to me.

175
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,948
In a big house, they tried to kill me.

176
00:18:12,116 --> 00:18:15,243
- All right, let's just go inside.
- I don't wanna go inside.

177
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:19,288
- Somebody call the police.
- Come on. Come on now.

178
00:18:19,456 --> 00:18:20,915
Okay.

179
00:18:29,007 --> 00:18:30,424
Sit down.

180
00:18:31,176 --> 00:18:32,718
I don't wanna sit.

181
00:18:33,262 --> 00:18:35,179
Perfectly all right. See?

182
00:18:35,347 --> 00:18:39,392
We'll get them. We'll throw the book
at them. Assault and kidnapping.

183
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:43,062
Assault with a gun, and a bourbon,
and a sports car. We'll get them.

184
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:46,983
You'll be all right after a good night's sleep.
We got a nice cell all made up.

185
00:18:47,151 --> 00:18:51,863
- I don't want a cell. I want a policeman.
- The car was just reported stolen.

186
00:18:52,197 --> 00:18:55,366
- Uh-huh.
- A Mrs. Babson up on Twining Road.

187
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:59,704
- I got to call someone. Where's the phone?
- You're allowed one call.

188
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:02,456
- Over here.
- Oh, thanks.

189
00:19:02,624 --> 00:19:05,001
You better make it your lawyer.

190
00:19:05,586 --> 00:19:07,753
Butterfield 8-1-0-9-8.

191
00:19:07,921 --> 00:19:09,922
What am I, a telephone operator?

192
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:12,633
Butterfield 8-1-0-9-8.

193
00:19:25,272 --> 00:19:27,607
Just a minute, please. Here.

194
00:19:27,774 --> 00:19:28,816
Thank you.

195
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:32,945
Hello, Mother?

196
00:19:33,113 --> 00:19:36,866
Mother, this is your son, Roger Thornhill.

197
00:19:37,034 --> 00:19:38,242
Yeah.

198
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:40,453
Wait a minute, I'll find out.

199
00:19:41,121 --> 00:19:44,832
- Where am I?
- Glen Cove Police Station.

200
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,169
Glen Cove Police Station.

201
00:19:49,171 --> 00:19:51,631
No. No, Mother, I have not been drinking.

202
00:19:51,798 --> 00:19:57,345
No. No, these two men, they poured
a whole bottle of bourbon into me.

203
00:19:57,888 --> 00:20:00,389
No, they didn't give me a chaser.

204
00:20:00,557 --> 00:20:01,599
No.

205
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:03,392
Come on, let's go.

206
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:07,980
- Wait, I'm not finished yet.
- Yes, you are. Come on.

207
00:20:08,148 --> 00:20:11,192
Mother, I gotta go now.

208
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,903
Get my lawyer right away,
and come out and bail me out.

209
00:20:14,071 --> 00:20:16,155
Tomorrow morning, tell her.

210
00:20:16,323 --> 00:20:18,658
Tomorrow morning, he says.

211
00:20:19,409 --> 00:20:22,495
I don't know. I'll ask him.
She wants to know who says.

212
00:20:22,663 --> 00:20:24,664
Sergeant Emile Klinger.

213
00:20:24,831 --> 00:20:26,707
Sergeant Emile...

214
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:28,501
Emile?

215
00:20:29,503 --> 00:20:32,338
Sergeant Emile Klinger.

216
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:35,091
No, I didn't believe it either.

217
00:20:35,884 --> 00:20:40,179
Uh, I'm all right, Mother. Good night.
Good night, dear.

218
00:20:44,476 --> 00:20:46,185
That was Mother.

219
00:20:46,603 --> 00:20:48,312
Let's go.

220
00:20:54,444 --> 00:20:56,570
Here's your man, doctor.

221
00:20:59,533 --> 00:21:02,326
- What's your name?
- Roger Thornhill.

222
00:21:02,494 --> 00:21:04,412
Stick out your tongue and say "ah. "

223
00:21:04,579 --> 00:21:06,038
You better move back.

224
00:21:06,206 --> 00:21:07,999
Ah...

225
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:09,625
Have you been drinking?

226
00:21:09,793 --> 00:21:12,295
Doctor, I am gassed.

227
00:21:12,462 --> 00:21:13,713
What were you drinking?

228
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:16,090
Well, bourbon.
See, these two fellas, they...

229
00:21:16,258 --> 00:21:18,843
- How much would you say you drank?
- What did you say?

230
00:21:19,011 --> 00:21:22,555
- How much would you say that you drank?
- About this much.

231
00:21:22,723 --> 00:21:26,225
Mr. Thornhill, it is my opinion
that you are definitely intoxicated.

232
00:21:26,393 --> 00:21:27,435
No question about it.

233
00:21:27,602 --> 00:21:29,895
I am now gonna ask your permission
to draw blood.

234
00:21:30,063 --> 00:21:31,063
How disgusting.

235
00:21:31,231 --> 00:21:33,649
"You may refuse to permit a blood test
to be made...

236
00:21:33,817 --> 00:21:35,943
...but if you do,
your license will be revoked.

237
00:21:36,111 --> 00:21:38,404
You have the right
to notify a physician of... "

238
00:21:38,572 --> 00:21:41,574
It was at this point
that Mr. Thornhill succeeded in escaping...

239
00:21:41,742 --> 00:21:45,077
...from his would-be assassins,
and when they gave chase...

240
00:21:45,245 --> 00:21:49,248
...he naturally had to drive as best he could
under the, uh, circumstances.

241
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:52,084
Counselor,
how long have you known your client?

242
00:21:52,252 --> 00:21:53,377
Seven years, Your Honor.

243
00:21:53,545 --> 00:21:55,838
Do you know him
to be a reasonable man?

244
00:21:56,131 --> 00:21:58,174
Absolutely.
- Ha.

245
00:21:59,343 --> 00:22:00,760
- Mother.
And do you believe...

246
00:22:00,927 --> 00:22:03,721
...there is some credence to this story?

247
00:22:03,889 --> 00:22:05,431
- Credence?
- Well, yes, Your Honor.

248
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:07,975
I mean, if my client says
this is what happened...

249
00:22:08,143 --> 00:22:10,728
...I'm certain it must've happened.
- You're damn right.

250
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:15,399
Sergeant, I want this turned over
to the county detectives for investigation.

251
00:22:15,567 --> 00:22:17,943
Call them up
and have them come here immediately.

252
00:22:18,111 --> 00:22:19,779
- Right, Your Honor.
Counselor...

253
00:22:19,946 --> 00:22:22,448
...I'm going to set this over for final
disposition...

254
00:22:22,616 --> 00:22:24,367
...tomorrow night at 7:30.

255
00:22:24,534 --> 00:22:28,120
At which time I expect you and the
defendant to be here, ready to go to trial.

256
00:22:28,288 --> 00:22:32,458
In the meantime, the county detectives will
determine if his story has any basis in fact.

257
00:22:33,335 --> 00:22:36,796
"Basis in fact"? If I were brought in dead,
you still wouldn't believe...

258
00:22:36,963 --> 00:22:38,089
Roger, wait a minute.

259
00:22:38,256 --> 00:22:41,050
I mean, after all, Your Honor,
would I make up such a story?

260
00:22:41,218 --> 00:22:45,805
That is precisely what
we're intending to find out, Mr. Thornhill.

261
00:23:03,156 --> 00:23:05,449
- Yes?
Remember me?

262
00:23:05,617 --> 00:23:06,867
- Yes, sir.
Good.

263
00:23:07,035 --> 00:23:10,413
- Is Mr. Townsend at home?
- No, I'm sorry he's left for the day, sir.

264
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:12,456
Mrs. Townsend?

265
00:23:12,624 --> 00:23:15,501
- Who shall I say is calling?
- County detectives.

266
00:23:15,669 --> 00:23:17,420
Come in, please.

267
00:23:27,139 --> 00:23:29,306
This way, please.

268
00:23:39,109 --> 00:23:40,443
This is the room.

269
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:42,611
- I'll call madam.
You do that.

270
00:23:42,779 --> 00:23:44,822
And here's the sofa
where they held me down.

271
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:48,284
They spilled bourbon all over it.
I'll show you the stains.

272
00:23:50,954 --> 00:23:53,330
Well, they must've cleaned them off.

273
00:23:53,498 --> 00:23:55,791
This is the cabinet
where they keep the liquor.

274
00:23:55,959 --> 00:23:58,252
Scotch, gin, vodka...

275
00:23:59,546 --> 00:24:01,380
And bourbon.

276
00:24:03,383 --> 00:24:06,177
I remember when it used to come
in bottles.

277
00:24:09,055 --> 00:24:13,684
Roger, dear,
we were so worried about you.

278
00:24:14,352 --> 00:24:17,313
Did you get home all right?
Of course you did.

279
00:24:17,481 --> 00:24:20,691
Let me look at you.
Oh, a little pink-eyed, but aren't we all?

280
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:23,569
It was a dull party.
You didn't miss a thing.

281
00:24:23,737 --> 00:24:26,822
I want you all to know,
I never saw this woman before last night.

282
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,826
I'm Captain Junket
of the Nassau County Detectives.

283
00:24:30,994 --> 00:24:33,746
- This is Lieutenant Harding.
- How do you do?

284
00:24:33,914 --> 00:24:36,332
You haven't gotten into trouble, Roger?

285
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,918
- Stop calling me Roger.
- Has he gotten into trouble?

286
00:24:39,085 --> 00:24:43,506
Mr. Thornhill was picked up last night
driving under the influence of alcohol...

287
00:24:43,673 --> 00:24:46,175
...and incidentally, in a stolen car.
- Stolen car?

288
00:24:46,343 --> 00:24:48,761
Belonging to Mrs. Babson
of Twining Road.

289
00:24:48,929 --> 00:24:51,305
Roger, you said
you were going to call a cab.

290
00:24:51,473 --> 00:24:56,519
- You didn't borrow Laura's Mercedes?
- No, I didn't borrow Laura's Mercedes.

291
00:24:56,686 --> 00:25:01,023
Mr. Thornhill told us that he was brought
to this house against his will last night...

292
00:25:01,191 --> 00:25:04,276
...and, uh, forcibly intoxicated
by some friends of your husband...

293
00:25:04,444 --> 00:25:05,861
...and set out on the road.

294
00:25:06,029 --> 00:25:08,614
- Do you know anything about this?
- Well, now, captain...

295
00:25:08,782 --> 00:25:11,700
...Roger was a bit tipsy
when he arrived here by cab for dinner.

296
00:25:11,868 --> 00:25:12,910
She's lying.

297
00:25:13,078 --> 00:25:14,954
And I'm afraid he became even worse...

298
00:25:15,121 --> 00:25:16,288
...as the evening wore on.

299
00:25:16,456 --> 00:25:19,583
Finally, he told us he had to go home
to sleep it off.

300
00:25:19,751 --> 00:25:22,211
Oh, I knew
I should've served dinner earlier.

301
00:25:22,379 --> 00:25:23,921
What a performance.

302
00:25:24,089 --> 00:25:27,550
Mrs. Townsend, does the name
George Kaplan mean anything to you?

303
00:25:27,717 --> 00:25:28,926
George Kaplan?

304
00:25:30,011 --> 00:25:31,762
- No.
- I didn't think so.

305
00:25:32,514 --> 00:25:35,391
Where's her husband?
He's the one you should be questioning.

306
00:25:35,559 --> 00:25:39,311
- Is there any place he can be reached?
- Why, yes. The United Nations.

307
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:41,272
United Nat...?

308
00:25:41,439 --> 00:25:44,483
He's addressing
the General Assembly this afternoon.

309
00:25:46,152 --> 00:25:48,529
All right. So he's addressing
the General Assembly.

310
00:25:48,697 --> 00:25:51,991
- Sorry we had to bother you.
- No bother at all.

311
00:25:54,786 --> 00:25:56,495
Now, wait a minute.

312
00:26:02,502 --> 00:26:05,004
Will you be wanting
to get in touch with my husband?

313
00:26:05,171 --> 00:26:07,381
No, Mrs. Townsend,
that won't be necessary.

314
00:26:07,549 --> 00:26:09,842
You mean you're not gonna
do any more about this?

315
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:14,096
Roger. Pay the two dollars.

316
00:26:29,154 --> 00:26:30,195
Goodbye.

317
00:26:57,515 --> 00:27:01,101
- I don't see why you want me along.
- You lend a certain air of respectability.

318
00:27:01,269 --> 00:27:03,187
Don't be sarcastic, Roger.

319
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,076
There you are, dear. Park yourself there.

320
00:27:17,243 --> 00:27:19,411
Well, here goes. Ahem.

321
00:27:19,829 --> 00:27:24,208
Hello, Operator. Have you got
a George Kaplan staying here?

322
00:27:25,085 --> 00:27:26,752
That's right.

323
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:27,961
You have?

324
00:27:28,129 --> 00:27:30,297
Room 796?

325
00:27:30,465 --> 00:27:32,216
Ring it, will you please?

326
00:27:32,384 --> 00:27:33,425
You see?

327
00:27:33,593 --> 00:27:35,719
I see. I hope he clears up
this silly business.

328
00:27:35,887 --> 00:27:38,639
- You're ruining my whole day.
- Shh, shh. All right. Quiet. Shut up.

329
00:27:39,557 --> 00:27:43,018
Oh. Well, did he leave word
when he'd be back?

330
00:27:43,603 --> 00:27:45,145
Really?

331
00:27:45,313 --> 00:27:47,147
Thank you.

332
00:27:47,315 --> 00:27:50,401
Well, that's odd. He hasn't answered
his telephone in two days.

333
00:27:50,568 --> 00:27:52,403
Maybe he got locked in the bathroom.

334
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:54,613
Mother, do me a favor, will you?

335
00:27:54,781 --> 00:27:58,742
Put on that innocent look you do so well
and go to the desk and get the key to 796.

336
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:01,120
Don't be ridiculous.
I wouldn't do such a thing.

337
00:28:01,287 --> 00:28:03,539
- Ten dollars?
- Not for all the money in the world.

338
00:28:03,707 --> 00:28:06,834
- Fifty?
- Roger, you are disgraceful.

339
00:28:10,588 --> 00:28:15,092
Car theft, drunk driving,
assaulting an officer, lying to a judge.

340
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,635
And now, housebreaking.

341
00:28:16,803 --> 00:28:18,929
You're hotel-breaking.
There's a difference.

342
00:28:19,097 --> 00:28:21,598
- Of five to ten years.
Just a minute, please.

343
00:28:24,144 --> 00:28:26,687
Will you want me
to be changing your bedding, sir?

344
00:28:26,855 --> 00:28:28,731
Yes. Well, but not right now.

345
00:28:28,898 --> 00:28:32,067
I mention it, because the bed
doesn't seem like it's been slept in...

346
00:28:32,235 --> 00:28:34,695
...and I was wondering
if I ought to go on changing the linens.

347
00:28:34,863 --> 00:28:38,574
- Oh. Thank you for your interest.
- You're welcome, sir.

348
00:28:38,742 --> 00:28:39,783
Come on, now.

349
00:28:43,455 --> 00:28:46,373
Now, she seemed to think I'm Kaplan.

350
00:28:46,541 --> 00:28:49,293
I wonder if I look like Kaplan.

351
00:28:59,345 --> 00:29:01,638
- Oh, well, look who's here.
- Who? Where?

352
00:29:01,806 --> 00:29:05,601
Our friend who's assembling
the General Assembly this afternoon.

353
00:29:05,769 --> 00:29:07,519
Roger, I think we should go.

354
00:29:07,687 --> 00:29:09,521
- Don't be nervous.
- I'm not nervous.

355
00:29:09,689 --> 00:29:13,317
- I'll be late for the bridge club.
- Good. You will lose less than usual.

356
00:29:26,456 --> 00:29:27,873
Ooh.

357
00:29:28,041 --> 00:29:31,543
- Bulletin, Kaplan has dandruff.
- In that case, I think we should leave.

358
00:29:33,046 --> 00:29:34,505
Too late.

359
00:29:39,719 --> 00:29:42,971
- You rang for me, sir?
- Yes. Come in a moment.

360
00:29:43,556 --> 00:29:46,850
- What's your name?
- Elsie, sir.

361
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:51,396
- Elsie, do you know who I am?
- You're... You're Mr. Kaplan.

362
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:54,733
Well, when did...?
When did you first see me?

363
00:29:54,901 --> 00:29:55,984
Outside the door.

364
00:29:56,653 --> 00:29:59,655
Out in the hall, a couple of minutes ago.
Don't you remember?

365
00:29:59,823 --> 00:30:01,907
And that's the first time
you laid eyes on me?

366
00:30:02,075 --> 00:30:04,409
Can I help it if you're never around,
Mr. Kaplan?

367
00:30:04,577 --> 00:30:06,578
Well, then, how do you know
I am Mr. Kaplan?

368
00:30:06,746 --> 00:30:08,747
- What?
- How do you know I'm Mr. Kaplan?

369
00:30:08,915 --> 00:30:12,334
Well, of course you are.
This is room 796, isn't it?

370
00:30:12,502 --> 00:30:16,296
So you're the gentleman in room 796,
aren't you?

371
00:30:16,464 --> 00:30:17,714
All right, Elsie, thanks.

372
00:30:17,882 --> 00:30:20,425
- Will that be all, sir?
- For the time being, yes.

373
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:27,599
Valet.

374
00:30:27,767 --> 00:30:29,518
Oh, yes, come in.

375
00:30:30,061 --> 00:30:32,062
Should I hang it in the closet, Mr. Kaplan?

376
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:33,772
Yes, please.

377
00:30:39,487 --> 00:30:40,988
Tell me, uh...

378
00:30:41,155 --> 00:30:43,782
I forgot,
what time did I give you that suit?

379
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:46,034
Last night, around, uh...

380
00:30:46,202 --> 00:30:47,452
- Around 6.
- Oh.

381
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:50,122
- Did I give it to you personally?
- Personally?

382
00:30:50,290 --> 00:30:53,500
No. You called down on the phone
and described the suit to me...

383
00:30:53,668 --> 00:30:57,379
...and said it would be hanging
in your closet. Like you always do.

384
00:30:57,547 --> 00:31:00,257
- Anything wrong?
- No, no, just curious.

385
00:31:00,425 --> 00:31:02,467
- Here. Thanks.
- Thank you.

386
00:31:02,635 --> 00:31:04,428
Nice to meet you, Mr. Kaplan.

387
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:10,809
Isn’t that the damnedest thing?

388
00:31:10,977 --> 00:31:14,354
I'm beginning to think that no one
in the hotel has actually seen Kaplan.

389
00:31:14,522 --> 00:31:17,274
Maybe he has his suits mended
by invisible weavers.

390
00:31:17,442 --> 00:31:18,817
Oh...

391
00:31:23,781 --> 00:31:25,449
Let me see something.

392
00:31:31,497 --> 00:31:34,333
I don't think that one does anything
for you.

393
00:31:39,505 --> 00:31:41,006
Ah, now, that's much better.

394
00:31:41,341 --> 00:31:43,592
Now, obviously they've mistaken me
for a much shorter man.

395
00:31:49,223 --> 00:31:51,516
- Should I?
- Certainly not.

396
00:31:53,144 --> 00:31:54,728
Here, hold that, dear.

397
00:31:57,941 --> 00:31:59,024
Hello.

398
00:31:59,192 --> 00:32:01,818
It's good to find you in, Mr. Kaplan.

399
00:32:01,986 --> 00:32:03,153
Who is this?

400
00:32:03,321 --> 00:32:06,448
We met only last night,
and still you do not recognize my voice.

401
00:32:06,616 --> 00:32:08,533
I should feel offended.

402
00:32:08,701 --> 00:32:11,912
Yes, I know who you are,
and I'm not Mr. Kaplan.

403
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:15,874
Of course not. You answer
his telephone, you live in his hotel room...

404
00:32:16,042 --> 00:32:18,043
...and yet you are not Mr. Kaplan.

405
00:32:18,211 --> 00:32:21,713
Nevertheless,
we are pleased to find you in.

406
00:32:21,881 --> 00:32:23,340
Now, wait...

407
00:32:24,509 --> 00:32:26,510
- Hello, Operator? Operator.
Yes?

408
00:32:26,678 --> 00:32:30,222
Operator, this is Mr. Thorn...
Kaplan in 796.

409
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:33,725
That call. Was that an outside call
or did it come from the lobby?

410
00:32:33,893 --> 00:32:36,353
Just a minute, sir. I'll see.
- Well, hurry, please.

411
00:32:36,521 --> 00:32:37,562
Who was it?

412
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:39,856
One of the men
who tried to kill me last night.

413
00:32:40,024 --> 00:32:42,359
- We're back to that one, are we?
- Hello? Operator?

414
00:32:42,527 --> 00:32:43,735
Mr. Kaplan?
- Yes.

415
00:32:43,903 --> 00:32:45,988
That call was made from the lobby, sir.

416
00:32:46,155 --> 00:32:47,531
It was?

417
00:32:47,699 --> 00:32:49,741
They're probably
on their way up here now.

418
00:32:49,909 --> 00:32:53,620
- Come on. Let's get out of here.
- I think I'd like to meet these killers.

419
00:33:37,665 --> 00:33:40,959
You gentlemen aren't really trying
to kill my son, are you?

420
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:06,485
Lobby, please. Watch your step.

421
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:10,739
Oh, no, gentlemen, please. Ladies first.
Come along, ladies.

422
00:34:10,907 --> 00:34:12,824
That's right. Come along. Good.

423
00:34:12,992 --> 00:34:16,161
Roger. Roger, will you be home
for dinner?

424
00:34:20,124 --> 00:34:23,251
Where to?
- I don't know. Just keep going.

425
00:34:38,351 --> 00:34:40,977
- Take me to the United Nations.
Right.

426
00:34:41,145 --> 00:34:42,854
General Assembly Building.

427
00:34:43,022 --> 00:34:45,899
Right.
- I'm being followed. Can you do anything?

428
00:34:46,067 --> 00:34:47,692
- Yes, I can.
- Do it.

429
00:35:20,852 --> 00:35:22,644
- May I help you, sir?
- Yes, please.

430
00:35:22,812 --> 00:35:27,274
- Where will I find Mr. Lester Townsend?
- Mr. Lester Townsend of UNIPO?

431
00:35:27,441 --> 00:35:30,235
- Yes.
- And did you have an appointment, sir?

432
00:35:30,403 --> 00:35:32,195
Well, yes, yes. He expects me.

433
00:35:32,363 --> 00:35:33,822
Your name, please.

434
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:36,116
- My name?
- Yes, please.

435
00:35:36,284 --> 00:35:38,577
Kaplan. George Kaplan.

436
00:35:40,204 --> 00:35:42,247
One moment, please.

437
00:35:47,795 --> 00:35:50,088
Wait for me at the corner of 47th.

438
00:35:57,263 --> 00:36:01,391
If you'll give this to one of the attendants
in the public lounge, she'll page him.

439
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:04,728
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome, Mr. Kaplan.

440
00:36:16,449 --> 00:36:20,118
Mr. Bernardi
of the Swiss Observers Office.

441
00:36:20,286 --> 00:36:23,955
Mr. Bernardi
of the Swiss Observers Office.

442
00:36:26,792 --> 00:36:28,919
Will you page
Mr. Lester Townsend, please?

443
00:36:29,086 --> 00:36:31,004
Certainly, Mr. Kaplan.

444
00:36:31,172 --> 00:36:34,758
Mr. Townsend of UNIPO.
Mr. Townsend of UNIPO.

445
00:36:34,926 --> 00:36:38,887
Please call at the communications desk
of the public lounge.

446
00:36:39,055 --> 00:36:40,972
Mr. Townsend of UNIPO.

447
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:44,392
Please call at the communications desk
of the public lounge.

448
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:47,395
Miss Knox of salon...

449
00:36:47,563 --> 00:36:48,813
You paged me?

450
00:36:48,981 --> 00:36:50,315
- Mr. Kaplan?
- Yes.

451
00:36:50,483 --> 00:36:52,275
- You wanted to see Mr. Townsend.
- Yes.

452
00:36:52,443 --> 00:36:55,904
- This is Mr. Townsend.
- How do you do, Mr. Kaplan?

453
00:36:56,072 --> 00:36:59,991
- This isn't Mr. Townsend.
- Yes, it is.

454
00:37:00,159 --> 00:37:02,661
There must be some mistake.
Mr. Lester Townsend?

455
00:37:02,828 --> 00:37:04,913
That's me. What can I do for you?

456
00:37:05,081 --> 00:37:08,458
Mr. Mauney, Delegation
of Pakistan. Please call the public lounge.

457
00:37:09,168 --> 00:37:11,336
Are you the Townsend
who lives in Glen Cove?

458
00:37:11,504 --> 00:37:14,506
That's right. Are we neighbors?

459
00:37:14,674 --> 00:37:17,592
A large, red-brick house
with a curved, tree-lined driveway?

460
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,636
That's the one.

461
00:37:20,137 --> 00:37:22,138
Were you at home last night,
Mr. Townsend?

462
00:37:22,306 --> 00:37:23,807
- You mean in Glen Cove?
- Yes.

463
00:37:23,975 --> 00:37:26,768
I've been staying in my apartment
in town for the last month.

464
00:37:26,936 --> 00:37:29,104
I always do when we're in session here.

465
00:37:29,272 --> 00:37:30,939
What about Mrs. Townsend?

466
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,191
My wife has been dead for many years.

467
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:36,152
- Oh, I...
- Now, Mr. Kaplan, what's this all about?

468
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,780
Forgive me. Who are those people living
in your house?

469
00:37:38,948 --> 00:37:41,491
What people?
The house is completely closed up.

470
00:37:42,243 --> 00:37:44,703
Just the gardener and his wife
living on the grounds.

471
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:47,956
Now, Mr. Kaplan, suppose you tell me
who you are and what you want.

472
00:37:48,124 --> 00:37:50,542
Well, please, just...

473
00:37:51,377 --> 00:37:54,004
Look. Do you know this man?

474
00:38:02,388 --> 00:38:04,055
Look!

475
00:38:08,185 --> 00:38:09,644
He's got a knife. Look out!

476
00:38:09,812 --> 00:38:12,605
Listen to me.
I had nothing to do with this.

477
00:38:12,773 --> 00:38:15,233
Call the police.
- Wait a minute. Don't come nearer.

478
00:38:15,401 --> 00:38:17,068
Get back.

479
00:38:35,921 --> 00:38:38,923
"The photograph has been
identified as that of Roger Thornhill...

480
00:38:39,091 --> 00:38:43,845
...a Manhattan advertising executive,
indicating that the name of George Kaplan...

481
00:38:44,013 --> 00:38:48,975
...which he gave to an attendant in the
General Assembly Building was false.

482
00:38:49,143 --> 00:38:53,271
A possible motive for the slaying
was suggested by the discovery...

483
00:38:53,439 --> 00:38:56,983
...that earlier today, Thornhill appeared
at Glen Cove police court...

484
00:38:57,151 --> 00:39:01,154
...charged with drunk driving
with a stolen car.

485
00:39:01,322 --> 00:39:04,616
In his defense, he charged
that the murder victim, Mr. Townsend...

486
00:39:04,784 --> 00:39:07,452
...had tried to kill him the night before. "

487
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:10,830
- Brother.
- What about that?

488
00:39:11,123 --> 00:39:13,875
Does anyone know this Thornhill?

489
00:39:14,043 --> 00:39:16,795
- No, not me.
- Never heard of him.

490
00:39:16,962 --> 00:39:18,046
Professor?

491
00:39:18,214 --> 00:39:22,092
Apparently, the poor sucker got mistaken
for George Kaplan.

492
00:39:22,259 --> 00:39:25,512
How can he get mistaken for
George Kaplan when he doesn't even exist?

493
00:39:25,679 --> 00:39:28,807
Don't ask me how it happened.
Obviously, it happened.

494
00:39:28,974 --> 00:39:32,894
Vandamm's men must have grabbed him
and tried to put him away...

495
00:39:33,062 --> 00:39:34,771
...using Lester Townsend's house.

496
00:39:34,939 --> 00:39:39,484
The unsuspecting Mr. Townsend winds up
with a stray knife in his back.

497
00:39:41,404 --> 00:39:43,988
So horribly sad.
How is it I feel like laughing?

498
00:39:44,156 --> 00:39:45,698
What are we going to do?

499
00:39:45,866 --> 00:39:46,991
Do?

500
00:39:47,159 --> 00:39:48,326
About Mr. Thornhill.

501
00:39:49,453 --> 00:39:51,037
We, uh...

502
00:39:51,205 --> 00:39:52,288
We do nothing.

503
00:39:53,082 --> 00:39:56,126
- Nothing?
- That's right. Nothing.

504
00:39:56,335 --> 00:40:01,172
Or we could congratulate ourselves
on a marvelous stroke of good fortune.

505
00:40:01,715 --> 00:40:05,677
Our non-existent decoy, George Kaplan,
created to divert suspicion...

506
00:40:05,845 --> 00:40:09,848
...from our actual agent,
has fortuitously become a live decoy.

507
00:40:10,015 --> 00:40:14,561
Yes, professor.
And how long do you think he'll stay live?

508
00:40:14,728 --> 00:40:16,479
Well, that's his problem.

509
00:40:16,647 --> 00:40:19,691
What Mrs. Finley means, is...
- Oh, I know what she means.

510
00:40:19,859 --> 00:40:23,027
We can't sit back calmly
and wait to see who kills him first.

511
00:40:23,195 --> 00:40:25,029
Vandamm and company or the police.

512
00:40:26,449 --> 00:40:29,951
What can we do to save him
without endangering our own agent?

513
00:40:30,119 --> 00:40:32,745
Aren't we being just a wee bit callous?

514
00:40:32,913 --> 00:40:35,707
No, my dear woman,
we're not being callous.

515
00:40:35,875 --> 00:40:40,086
We didn't invent our nonexistent man
and give him the name of George Kaplan...

516
00:40:40,254 --> 00:40:43,047
...and establish elaborate behavior patterns
for him...

517
00:40:43,215 --> 00:40:45,967
...and move his prop belongings
in and out of hotel rooms...

518
00:40:46,135 --> 00:40:48,386
...for our own private amusement.

519
00:40:48,804 --> 00:40:50,722
We created George Kaplan...

520
00:40:50,890 --> 00:40:53,183
...and labored successfully
to convince Vandamm...

521
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:57,228
...that this was our own agent hot on his
trail for a desperately important reason.

522
00:40:57,396 --> 00:40:59,606
Check.
- Nobody's denying that!

523
00:40:59,773 --> 00:41:01,107
Very well, then.

524
00:41:01,275 --> 00:41:05,403
If we make the slightest move to suggest
there is no such agent as George Kaplan...

525
00:41:05,571 --> 00:41:08,198
...give any hint to Vandamm
that he's pursuing a decoy...

526
00:41:08,365 --> 00:41:10,158
...instead of our own agent...

527
00:41:10,326 --> 00:41:13,912
...then our agent,
working right under Vandamm's very nose...

528
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:17,248
...will immediately face suspicion,
exposure...

529
00:41:17,416 --> 00:41:19,584
...and assassination.

530
00:41:20,461 --> 00:41:22,170
Like the two others who went before.

531
00:41:22,338 --> 00:41:26,758
Goodbye, Mr. Thornhill,
wherever you are.

532
00:41:31,931 --> 00:41:37,018
New York Central Railroad,
train number 25...

533
00:41:37,186 --> 00:41:40,939
...the 20th Century Limited...

534
00:41:41,106 --> 00:41:45,944
...due to leave at 6 p. m. For Chicago...

535
00:41:46,111 --> 00:41:52,408
...will depart from plank number 30.
- Yes. Yes, dear. I know.

536
00:41:52,576 --> 00:41:55,912
Now, listen to me, Mother, I beg you.
I called the Plaza.

537
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:59,207
Kaplan checked out. He went
to the hotel Ambassador East in Chicago.

538
00:41:59,375 --> 00:42:01,459
Yes, that's why I'm...

539
00:42:01,627 --> 00:42:04,170
Well, I can't go to the police.
At least not yet.

540
00:42:04,338 --> 00:42:07,048
You saw the newspapers.
My fingerprints are on the knife...

541
00:42:07,216 --> 00:42:10,426
...I'm a car thief, a drunk driver,
and I murdered a man for revenge.

542
00:42:10,594 --> 00:42:11,928
I wouldn't have a chance.

543
00:42:12,096 --> 00:42:16,432
And I won't have, until I find George Kaplan
who obviously knows what this is all about.

544
00:42:16,892 --> 00:42:19,352
No, dear, the train. It's safer.

545
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:23,606
Well, because there's no place to hide
on a plane if anyone should recognize me.

546
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:27,360
You want me to jump off a moving plane?

547
00:42:27,570 --> 00:42:31,489
Yes. Well, thank you so much, Mother.
Yeah, well, goodbye.

548
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:37,161
Attention, please.

549
00:42:37,329 --> 00:42:43,126
New York Central Railroad,
train number 25...

550
00:42:43,294 --> 00:42:46,462
...the 20th Century Limited...

551
00:42:47,339 --> 00:42:50,633
...due to leave at 6 p. m.

552
00:43:08,694 --> 00:43:09,694
Yeah.

553
00:43:09,862 --> 00:43:12,488
Uh, give me a bedroom
on the 20th Century, please.

554
00:43:12,656 --> 00:43:14,032
It's leaving in five minutes.

555
00:43:14,199 --> 00:43:17,702
- Yes, I know. Could you make it snappy?
- I think they're all sold out.

556
00:43:17,870 --> 00:43:20,580
- Sold out?
You can always go coach.

557
00:43:20,748 --> 00:43:23,374
No, I can't do that.
What time is the next train?

558
00:43:23,542 --> 00:43:26,628
Nothing till 10. You're in a hurry, huh?

559
00:43:26,795 --> 00:43:29,589
Well, could you call them
and see what they have?

560
00:43:29,757 --> 00:43:31,424
Something wrong with your eyes?

561
00:43:31,592 --> 00:43:34,552
Yes, they're sensitive to questions.
Will you call them?

562
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,554
Sure. Sure.

563
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:41,309
Don't go away.

564
00:43:49,943 --> 00:43:53,446
He's at Window 15, upper level. Hurry.

565
00:43:54,615 --> 00:43:56,741
You're in luck, mister, you...

566
00:44:03,582 --> 00:44:06,042
- Ticket?
- I'm just seeing some friends off.

567
00:44:07,586 --> 00:44:10,546
Sorry, I have to know their names
before I can let you through.

568
00:44:10,714 --> 00:44:11,756
Come here! Hey, come here!

569
00:44:41,495 --> 00:44:43,287
Oh.

570
00:44:44,456 --> 00:44:47,542
- Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- My fault.

571
00:44:48,127 --> 00:44:49,961
Sorry.

572
00:44:58,637 --> 00:45:01,305
He went that way. I think he got off.

573
00:45:01,473 --> 00:45:03,307
All aboard!

574
00:45:06,854 --> 00:45:09,021
- Thank you.
- It's quite all right.

575
00:45:09,189 --> 00:45:12,650
- Seven parking tickets.
- Oh.

576
00:46:30,896 --> 00:46:33,648
Good evening, sir. One?
- Please.

577
00:46:47,246 --> 00:46:48,496
Cocktail before dinner?

578
00:46:48,664 --> 00:46:50,915
- Yes, please. A Gibson.
Right away.

579
00:47:00,926 --> 00:47:04,262
- Well, here we are again.
- Yes.

580
00:47:05,806 --> 00:47:08,641
- Do you recommend anything?
- The brook trout.

581
00:47:08,809 --> 00:47:10,852
A little trouty, but quite good.

582
00:47:11,562 --> 00:47:12,603
Sold.

583
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:17,400
Brook trout.

584
00:47:18,110 --> 00:47:19,777
- There you are. Thank you.
Yes, sir.

585
00:47:32,124 --> 00:47:35,293
- I know. I look vaguely familiar.
- Yes.

586
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:37,378
You feel you've seen me
somewhere before.

587
00:47:39,715 --> 00:47:43,718
Funny how I have that effect on people.
It's something about my face.

588
00:47:43,886 --> 00:47:46,178
It's a nice face.

589
00:47:46,346 --> 00:47:50,016
- You think so?
- I wouldn't say it if I didn't.

590
00:47:50,183 --> 00:47:53,394
Oh, you're that type.
- What type?

591
00:47:53,562 --> 00:47:55,104
Honest.

592
00:47:55,272 --> 00:47:56,397
Not really.

593
00:47:57,065 --> 00:48:00,818
- Good. Because honest women frighten me.
Why?

594
00:48:00,986 --> 00:48:03,821
I don't know. Somehow,
they seem to put me at a disadvantage.

595
00:48:03,989 --> 00:48:07,241
- Because you're not honest with them?
Exactly.

596
00:48:07,409 --> 00:48:10,494
Like that business
about the seven parking tickets?

597
00:48:10,662 --> 00:48:15,082
Well, what I mean is,
the moment I meet an attractive woman...

598
00:48:15,250 --> 00:48:18,878
...I have to start pretending
I've no desire to make love to her.

599
00:48:19,212 --> 00:48:21,881
What makes you think you have
to conceal it?

600
00:48:22,049 --> 00:48:24,008
She might find the idea objectionable.

601
00:48:24,718 --> 00:48:26,177
Then again, she might not.

602
00:48:29,973 --> 00:48:32,433
Think how lucky I am
to have been seated here.

603
00:48:32,601 --> 00:48:35,061
Oh, luck had nothing to do with it.

604
00:48:35,228 --> 00:48:36,979
Fate?

605
00:48:38,065 --> 00:48:42,109
I tipped the steward $5 to seat you here
if you should come in.

606
00:48:46,198 --> 00:48:47,281
Is that a proposition?

607
00:48:49,201 --> 00:48:51,452
I never discuss love
on an empty stomach.

608
00:48:52,371 --> 00:48:53,621
You've already eaten.

609
00:48:54,373 --> 00:48:55,456
But you haven't.

610
00:49:02,923 --> 00:49:05,007
Don't you think it's time
we were introduced?

611
00:49:05,759 --> 00:49:09,220
I'm Eve Kendall. I'm 26 and unmarried.

612
00:49:10,222 --> 00:49:12,431
Now you know everything.

613
00:49:12,599 --> 00:49:16,519
Tell me. What do you do besides lure men
to their doom on the 20th Century Limited?

614
00:49:16,687 --> 00:49:18,896
I'm an industrial designer.

615
00:49:20,315 --> 00:49:24,402
Jack Phillips. Western sales manager
for Kingby Electronics.

616
00:49:24,569 --> 00:49:28,531
No, you're not.
You're Roger Thornhill of Madison Avenue...

617
00:49:28,699 --> 00:49:31,867
...and you're wanted for murder
on every front page in America.

618
00:49:32,035 --> 00:49:34,495
And don't be so modest.

619
00:49:34,663 --> 00:49:36,122
Whoops.

620
00:49:36,957 --> 00:49:38,082
Oh, don't worry.

621
00:49:38,583 --> 00:49:40,584
- I won't say a word.
- How come?

622
00:49:41,962 --> 00:49:43,671
I told you.

623
00:49:43,839 --> 00:49:45,047
It's a nice face.

624
00:49:45,549 --> 00:49:46,757
Is that the only reason?

625
00:49:47,467 --> 00:49:49,260
It's going to be a long night.

626
00:49:50,429 --> 00:49:51,429
True.

627
00:49:51,596 --> 00:49:54,265
And I don't particularly like the book
I've started.

628
00:49:56,184 --> 00:49:57,351
You know what I mean?

629
00:49:58,979 --> 00:50:01,022
Let me think.

630
00:50:04,443 --> 00:50:06,027
Yes, I know exactly what you mean.

631
00:50:18,874 --> 00:50:20,583
There's my trademark. R.O.T.

632
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:24,712
Roger O. Thornhill.
What does the "O" stand for?

633
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:26,756
Nothing.

634
00:50:49,488 --> 00:50:52,323
I'd invite you to my bedroom
if I had a bedroom.

635
00:50:52,866 --> 00:50:55,159
- A roomette?
- Nothing, not even a ticket.

636
00:50:55,327 --> 00:50:59,497
I've been playing hide-and-seek
ever since the train left New York.

637
00:51:00,248 --> 00:51:02,666
- How awkward for you.
- Yes, isn't it?

638
00:51:02,834 --> 00:51:04,085
No place to sleep.

639
00:51:05,504 --> 00:51:07,671
I have a large drawing room all to myself.

640
00:51:08,507 --> 00:51:10,299
That doesn't seem quite fair, does it?

641
00:51:11,343 --> 00:51:13,302
Drawing room E.

642
00:51:13,470 --> 00:51:15,304
Car 3901.

643
00:51:16,223 --> 00:51:17,640
Such a nice number.

644
00:51:19,184 --> 00:51:20,851
It's easy to remember.

645
00:51:21,019 --> 00:51:22,812
Thirty-nine-oh-one.

646
00:51:23,730 --> 00:51:24,772
See?

647
00:51:26,358 --> 00:51:27,358
No luggage.

648
00:51:31,029 --> 00:51:32,530
- So?
- Well, you wouldn't happen...

649
00:51:32,697 --> 00:51:35,241
...to have an extra pair of pajamas,
would you?

650
00:51:35,408 --> 00:51:36,659
Wouldn't I?

651
00:51:38,662 --> 00:51:41,831
Incidentally, I wouldn't order any dessert
if I were you.

652
00:51:41,998 --> 00:51:43,040
I get the message.

653
00:51:44,042 --> 00:51:45,626
That isn't exactly what I meant.

654
00:51:46,128 --> 00:51:48,379
This train seems to be making
an unscheduled stop.

655
00:51:48,547 --> 00:51:52,550
And I just saw two men get out
of a police car as we pulled into the station.

656
00:51:53,218 --> 00:51:54,385
They weren't smiling.

657
00:52:16,783 --> 00:52:19,410
I think you better go out
and tell those police to hurry.

658
00:52:19,578 --> 00:52:21,162
Patience is a virtue.

659
00:52:21,329 --> 00:52:22,746
So is breathing.

660
00:52:22,914 --> 00:52:25,291
Just lie still.

661
00:52:26,209 --> 00:52:27,877
Have you got any olive oil?

662
00:52:28,044 --> 00:52:29,336
Olive oil?

663
00:52:29,504 --> 00:52:32,423
I want to be packed in olive oil
if I'm gonna be a sardine.

664
00:52:34,176 --> 00:52:35,634
Come in.

665
00:52:36,845 --> 00:52:39,513
- Who are you?
- State police.

666
00:52:40,265 --> 00:52:41,599
Your name please?

667
00:52:41,766 --> 00:52:44,268
Eve Kendall. Is anything wrong?

668
00:52:44,436 --> 00:52:47,605
There was a man at your table tonight
in the dining car.

669
00:52:47,772 --> 00:52:50,608
- Yes.
Friend of yours?

670
00:52:50,775 --> 00:52:52,359
I never saw him before.

671
00:52:54,029 --> 00:52:55,696
Is this the man?

672
00:52:56,615 --> 00:52:59,867
Yes, I think so.
It's not a very clear picture.

673
00:53:00,035 --> 00:53:02,953
It's a Wirephoto.
We just got it from the New York police.

674
00:53:03,121 --> 00:53:05,122
- Police?
- He's wanted for murder.

675
00:53:06,666 --> 00:53:08,292
Good heavens, no.

676
00:53:09,044 --> 00:53:11,587
The steward said
you left the dining car together.

677
00:53:11,755 --> 00:53:15,549
We might have happened to leave
at the same time, but not together.

678
00:53:16,301 --> 00:53:17,635
What did you two talk about?

679
00:53:18,678 --> 00:53:19,720
Talk about?

680
00:53:20,347 --> 00:53:23,349
Your waiter said you were getting along
good with this Thornhill.

681
00:53:23,516 --> 00:53:25,351
Is that his name? Thornhill?

682
00:53:26,061 --> 00:53:28,270
You mean, he didn't tell you?

683
00:53:28,438 --> 00:53:30,606
He didn't tell me anything.

684
00:53:30,774 --> 00:53:33,984
All we did was chat
about different kinds of food...

685
00:53:34,152 --> 00:53:37,112
...train travel versus plane travel,
that sort of thing.

686
00:53:37,822 --> 00:53:42,243
Rather innocuous, I must say,
considering he was a fugitive from justice.

687
00:53:42,410 --> 00:53:45,329
- Who did he kill?
- He didn't say where he was going, did he?

688
00:53:46,331 --> 00:53:49,333
No. I assumed Chicago.

689
00:53:49,501 --> 00:53:51,585
You think perhaps he got off
when you got on?

690
00:53:52,712 --> 00:53:55,089
If you happen
to catch sight of him again, Miss, uh...

691
00:53:55,257 --> 00:53:56,340
Kendall.

692
00:53:56,508 --> 00:53:58,342
Will you let us know?

693
00:53:58,927 --> 00:54:01,011
I'm going to bed
and I intend to lock my door.

694
00:54:01,179 --> 00:54:03,514
So I doubt if I'll seeing
anybody else tonight.

695
00:54:03,682 --> 00:54:07,977
Well, just in case you do, we'll be in
the observation car at the rear of the train.

696
00:54:08,144 --> 00:54:09,520
It's comforting to know that.

697
00:54:11,231 --> 00:54:12,314
Good night.

698
00:54:14,359 --> 00:54:15,651
Still breathing?

699
00:54:15,819 --> 00:54:18,904
Either hurry up or get me a snorkel.

700
00:54:19,072 --> 00:54:22,700
I'm looking for the can opener
I stole from the porter.

701
00:54:27,914 --> 00:54:29,373
Hello, there.

702
00:54:29,624 --> 00:54:31,166
Hello.

703
00:54:36,631 --> 00:54:37,923
Hmm.

704
00:54:43,221 --> 00:54:45,472
Tell me, why are you so good to me?

705
00:54:46,725 --> 00:54:48,726
Shall I climb up and tell you why?

706
00:55:02,907 --> 00:55:05,868
You know, I've been thinking,
it's not safe for you...

707
00:55:06,036 --> 00:55:08,996
...to roam around Chicago
looking for this George Kaplan man...

708
00:55:09,164 --> 00:55:11,165
...you've been telling me about.

709
00:55:11,624 --> 00:55:15,461
You'll be picked up by the police
the moment you show your face.

710
00:55:15,628 --> 00:55:17,254
Such a nice face too.

711
00:55:20,133 --> 00:55:25,220
Now, don't you think it would be a better
idea if you stayed in my hotel room...

712
00:55:25,388 --> 00:55:29,600
...while I located him for you
and brought him to you?

713
00:55:29,768 --> 00:55:32,603
I can't let you get involved.
It's too dangerous.

714
00:55:33,772 --> 00:55:35,189
I'm a big girl.

715
00:55:36,483 --> 00:55:39,026
Yeah, and in all the right places too.

716
00:55:44,115 --> 00:55:46,867
You know, this is ridiculous.
You know that, don't you?

717
00:55:47,035 --> 00:55:48,118
Yes.

718
00:55:48,286 --> 00:55:50,412
I mean, we've hardly met.

719
00:55:50,622 --> 00:55:52,247
That's right.

720
00:55:52,415 --> 00:55:55,084
How do I know you aren't a murderer?

721
00:55:55,251 --> 00:55:56,877
You don't.

722
00:55:57,045 --> 00:56:00,714
Maybe you're planning to murder me,
right here, tonight.

723
00:56:01,549 --> 00:56:02,800
Shall I?

724
00:56:03,968 --> 00:56:05,260
Please do.

725
00:56:26,074 --> 00:56:27,825
Beats flying, doesn't it?

726
00:56:30,245 --> 00:56:31,829
We should stop.

727
00:56:31,996 --> 00:56:33,789
Immediately.

728
00:56:33,957 --> 00:56:36,166
I ought to know more about you.

729
00:56:36,751 --> 00:56:38,335
What more could you know?

730
00:56:41,214 --> 00:56:44,007
You're an advertising man,
that's all I know.

731
00:56:44,175 --> 00:56:45,926
That's right.

732
00:56:47,887 --> 00:56:49,930
Train's a little unsteady.

733
00:56:50,098 --> 00:56:52,015
Who isn't?

734
00:56:52,183 --> 00:56:54,184
What else do you know?

735
00:56:55,562 --> 00:56:59,606
You've got taste in clothes,
taste in food...

736
00:57:01,693 --> 00:57:05,362
And taste in women. I like your flavor.

737
00:57:13,079 --> 00:57:15,247
You're very clever with words.

738
00:57:15,415 --> 00:57:18,208
You can probably make them
do anything for you.

739
00:57:19,377 --> 00:57:21,628
Sell people things they don't need...

740
00:57:21,796 --> 00:57:25,382
...make women who don't know you
fall in love with you.

741
00:57:27,385 --> 00:57:30,262
I'm beginning to think I'm underpaid.

742
00:57:43,735 --> 00:57:45,319
Look out.

743
00:57:54,746 --> 00:57:56,330
Oh, porter.

744
00:57:56,498 --> 00:57:59,208
- Don't bother with the washroom.
- Yes, ma'am.

745
00:57:59,375 --> 00:58:02,169
By the way, I found this on the floor.
Does it belong to you?

746
00:58:02,337 --> 00:58:04,421
Yes, ma'am.
I've been looking all over for it.

747
00:58:04,589 --> 00:58:06,757
- I'll wait outside.
- Thank you.

748
00:58:23,816 --> 00:58:24,858
Thank you, porter.

749
00:58:25,276 --> 00:58:26,944
Thank you, ma'am. Good night, now.

750
00:58:27,111 --> 00:58:28,779
Good night.

751
00:58:32,825 --> 00:58:35,118
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

752
00:58:40,166 --> 00:58:41,625
The porter.

753
00:58:43,586 --> 00:58:45,212
So I see.

754
00:58:50,802 --> 00:58:52,427
Now...

755
00:58:53,137 --> 00:58:56,515
...where were we?
- Here.

756
00:58:58,643 --> 00:59:00,811
Oh, yes.

757
00:59:01,396 --> 00:59:05,274
- Nice of him to have opened the bed.
- Yes.

758
00:59:05,441 --> 00:59:08,944
- Only one bed.
- Yes.

759
00:59:09,112 --> 00:59:11,405
That's a good omen, don't you think?

760
00:59:11,573 --> 00:59:13,323
Wonderful.

761
00:59:14,325 --> 00:59:16,910
Do you know what that means?

762
00:59:17,078 --> 00:59:18,620
What? Tell me.

763
00:59:19,330 --> 00:59:22,457
It means you're going
to sleep on the floor.

764
00:59:43,855 --> 00:59:46,607
A message from the lady in 3901.

765
01:00:29,817 --> 01:00:32,569
- You keep walking. I'll catch up.
- Yes, ma'am.

766
01:00:34,072 --> 01:00:38,325
- Anything to report, Miss Kendall?
- Why, yes. I had a fine night's sleep.

767
01:00:39,077 --> 01:00:41,536
No, I mean, have you seen the man
we're looking for?

768
01:00:42,246 --> 01:00:45,248
- Mr. Thornycroft?
- Thornhill.

769
01:00:46,959 --> 01:00:49,294
No, no. I'm awfully sorry.

770
01:00:49,462 --> 01:00:51,546
But good luck to you both.

771
01:00:55,843 --> 01:00:59,429
- How are we doing?
- Oh, I may collapse at any moment.

772
01:00:59,597 --> 01:01:01,973
Not yet.
First we have to run the gauntlet. Look.

773
01:01:02,141 --> 01:01:03,266
Hmm?

774
01:01:08,272 --> 01:01:12,109
I'm accustomed to having a load on,
but what have you got in these bags?

775
01:01:12,276 --> 01:01:15,028
- Bowling balls, naturally.
- Oh, naturally.

776
01:01:15,196 --> 01:01:19,449
- Which one of these has my suit in it?
- The small one underneath your right arm.

777
01:01:19,617 --> 01:01:22,119
Oh, thanks. That ought to do the suit
a lot of good.

778
01:01:22,286 --> 01:01:24,705
I'm sure Mr. Kaplan
won't mind a few wrinkles.

779
01:01:24,872 --> 01:01:27,457
Yeah, if he's still there. What time is it?

780
01:01:27,834 --> 01:01:28,875
Nine-ten.

781
01:01:29,043 --> 01:01:31,795
Nine-ten? Well, he may have left
his hotel room by now.

782
01:01:31,963 --> 01:01:34,631
I'll call him for you
as soon as we get inside the station.

783
01:01:34,799 --> 01:01:36,299
No thank you, I can do it.

784
01:01:36,467 --> 01:01:39,845
A redcap in a phone booth?
Slightly suspicious.

785
01:01:40,012 --> 01:01:43,140
I, uh... Well, all right. What are you gonna
tell him? Do you know that?

786
01:01:43,307 --> 01:01:47,477
Mm-hm. You want to see him right away.
Terribly urgent. Matter of life and death.

787
01:01:47,645 --> 01:01:49,813
- Mm-hm. Right.
- No explanations.

788
01:01:49,981 --> 01:01:52,399
While I'm calling,
you can change your clothes.

789
01:01:52,567 --> 01:01:55,986
Where do you propose I do that?
In Marshall Field's window?

790
01:01:56,154 --> 01:01:58,572
I sort of had the men's room in mind.

791
01:01:58,740 --> 01:02:00,490
Did you, now?

792
01:02:00,992 --> 01:02:04,494
You're the smartest girl
I ever spent the night with on a train.

793
01:02:16,174 --> 01:02:17,841
I think we made it.

794
01:02:21,512 --> 01:02:22,554
Where did he go?

795
01:02:22,722 --> 01:02:24,514
- Which way did he go?
- Where did he go?

796
01:02:24,682 --> 01:02:27,058
I don't know. He took my clothes.
And went that way.

797
01:02:27,226 --> 01:02:28,351
Come on.

798
01:04:07,159 --> 01:04:11,371
Departing at 10 a. m.,
Chicago daylight time...

799
01:04:11,539 --> 01:04:14,249
...for Michigan City.

800
01:04:36,772 --> 01:04:39,441
Now ready on track number six.

801
01:04:43,821 --> 01:04:45,113
Well, what took you so long?

802
01:04:45,281 --> 01:04:48,450
Well, I have a big face, small razor.
Tell me, did you get Kaplan?

803
01:04:48,618 --> 01:04:50,952
- Yes.
- Fine. What did he say?

804
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:54,164
Well, he'll see you, but not at the hotel
under any circumstances.

805
01:04:54,332 --> 01:04:56,666
- He'll see you on the outside.
- Well, where? When?

806
01:04:56,834 --> 01:04:59,085
- I've got it all written down for you.
- Thanks.

807
01:04:59,253 --> 01:05:01,546
Take the Greyhound bus
that leaves Chicago...

808
01:05:01,714 --> 01:05:07,719
...for Indianapolis at 2 and ask the driver
to let you off at Prairie Stop, Highway 41.

809
01:05:07,887 --> 01:05:10,013
Prairie Stop, Highway 41. Good.

810
01:05:10,181 --> 01:05:12,515
It's about an hour-and-a-half's drive
from Chicago.

811
01:05:12,683 --> 01:05:13,725
Fine. I'll rent a car.

812
01:05:13,893 --> 01:05:18,396
No car. Mr. Kaplan said bus.
He wants to be sure you're alone.

813
01:05:18,564 --> 01:05:21,066
All right. What'll I do when I get there?

814
01:05:21,233 --> 01:05:23,610
Just wait beside the road.
He'll be there at 3:30.

815
01:05:23,778 --> 01:05:25,779
- Well, how will I know him?
- He'll know you.

816
01:05:25,947 --> 01:05:29,574
- You made the Chicago papers too.
- Oh, yes.

817
01:05:29,742 --> 01:05:31,868
Have you got your watch set
for Central time?

818
01:05:32,036 --> 01:05:34,037
Yes, I did that. Thanks.

819
01:05:34,872 --> 01:05:37,707
- What's the matter?
- Matter?

820
01:05:37,875 --> 01:05:40,168
Yes, you seem... I don't know.
You seem tense.

821
01:05:40,336 --> 01:05:43,213
You know, you better go before the police
run out of redcaps.

822
01:05:43,381 --> 01:05:45,924
We'll see each other again, won't we?

823
01:05:46,092 --> 01:05:47,842
Sometime, I'm sure.

824
01:05:48,886 --> 01:05:51,304
I never had a moment
to thank you properly.

825
01:05:51,472 --> 01:05:54,683
Please go.
- Yes, but... But where will I find you?

826
01:05:54,850 --> 01:05:56,643
I've gotta pick up my bags now.

827
01:05:56,811 --> 01:05:59,896
Oh, yes. Well, these are the checks
for the large cases.

828
01:06:00,064 --> 01:06:01,398
Wait a minute.

829
01:06:02,066 --> 01:06:03,817
Please.

830
01:06:04,902 --> 01:06:06,736
They're coming.

831
01:10:29,792 --> 01:10:31,417
Hi.

832
01:10:33,587 --> 01:10:36,297
- Hot day.
- Seen worse.

833
01:10:38,717 --> 01:10:40,843
Are you supposed
to be meeting someone here?

834
01:10:41,011 --> 01:10:44,681
- Waiting for the bus. Due any minute.
- Oh.

835
01:10:45,349 --> 01:10:48,768
Some of them crop-duster pilots get rich,
if they live long enough.

836
01:10:49,853 --> 01:10:51,396
Yeah.

837
01:10:51,939 --> 01:10:55,191
And, uh, then your name isn't Kaplan?

838
01:10:55,859 --> 01:10:58,152
Can't say it is, because it ain't.

839
01:10:58,862 --> 01:11:01,447
Here she comes. Right on time.

840
01:11:04,743 --> 01:11:06,744
- That's funny.
- What?

841
01:11:06,912 --> 01:11:09,664
That plane's dusting crops
where there ain't no crops.

842
01:15:03,315 --> 01:15:06,692
Get out of here!
The other tank may blow!

843
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:18,621
What happened?

844
01:15:42,312 --> 01:15:44,105
Hey!

845
01:15:44,731 --> 01:15:46,482
Come back! Hey!

846
01:15:46,650 --> 01:15:51,070
Come back! Come back! Hey!

847
01:16:39,328 --> 01:16:40,494
- Yes?
- Uh...

848
01:16:40,662 --> 01:16:43,873
Could you let me have
Mr. George Kaplan's room number, please?

849
01:16:44,041 --> 01:16:45,333
- Kaplan?
- Yeah.

850
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:48,210
I think he checked out.

851
01:16:48,378 --> 01:16:50,212
- He checked out?
- That's right.

852
01:16:50,380 --> 01:16:52,381
He checked out at 7:10 this morning.

853
01:16:52,549 --> 01:16:56,218
- Seven-ten? Are you sure?
- Yes. He left a forwarding address.

854
01:16:56,386 --> 01:16:59,347
Hotel Sheraton-Johnson,
Rapid City, South Dakota.

855
01:16:59,514 --> 01:17:01,307
Seven-ten?

856
01:17:01,475 --> 01:17:04,060
Well, then how come I got a message
from him at 9...?

857
01:17:04,227 --> 01:17:05,728
What's that?

858
01:17:08,815 --> 01:17:10,524
Nothing. Nothing.

859
01:17:38,261 --> 01:17:40,262
Sorry to bother you again.

860
01:17:40,430 --> 01:17:43,307
Miss Eve Kendall is expecting me.
She's in room four-something.

861
01:17:43,475 --> 01:17:46,102
I've forgotten the number.
Would you mind?

862
01:17:55,612 --> 01:17:58,447
- She's in 463.
- Oh, yes, that's right. Thanks.

863
01:18:24,641 --> 01:18:25,975
Hello.

864
01:18:32,190 --> 01:18:33,232
Surprised?

865
01:18:34,276 --> 01:18:35,317
Yes.

866
01:18:36,486 --> 01:18:38,279
No getting rid of me, is there?

867
01:18:50,292 --> 01:18:52,334
I could use a drink.

868
01:18:53,837 --> 01:18:57,381
- I have some Scotch.
- With water. No ice.

869
01:19:05,474 --> 01:19:07,892
How did it go today?

870
01:19:10,937 --> 01:19:14,774
The meeting with Kaplan?

871
01:19:15,025 --> 01:19:16,942
He didn't show up.

872
01:19:17,778 --> 01:19:19,195
Oh?

873
01:19:19,362 --> 01:19:21,030
It's funny, isn't it?

874
01:19:21,531 --> 01:19:22,531
Why funny?

875
01:19:22,699 --> 01:19:28,412
Oh, after all those involved and explicit
directions he gave you on the phone.

876
01:19:29,080 --> 01:19:33,459
- Maybe I copied them down wrong.
- I don't think you got them wrong.

877
01:19:33,627 --> 01:19:37,129
I think you sent me to the right place,
all right.

878
01:19:38,423 --> 01:19:41,300
Why don't you call him back again
and see what happened?

879
01:19:41,468 --> 01:19:45,554
I did. He checked out.
Went to South Dakota.

880
01:19:45,722 --> 01:19:47,515
South Dakota?

881
01:19:47,682 --> 01:19:49,558
Rapid City.

882
01:19:50,894 --> 01:19:52,645
Well, what are you going to do next?

883
01:19:53,563 --> 01:19:55,064
I haven't made my mind up yet.

884
01:19:55,565 --> 01:19:57,817
It may depend on you.

885
01:19:58,985 --> 01:20:01,821
- On me?
- Sure.

886
01:20:02,614 --> 01:20:05,115
You're my little helper, aren't you?

887
01:20:05,283 --> 01:20:10,246
Thank you. To us.
To a long and lasting friendship.

888
01:20:10,413 --> 01:20:15,125
Meaning, from now on, I'm not going
to let you out of my sight, sweetheart.

889
01:20:15,293 --> 01:20:17,336
I'm afraid you'll have to.

890
01:20:17,504 --> 01:20:21,006
- Oh, no.
- I do have plans of my own, you know?

891
01:20:21,174 --> 01:20:22,925
And you do have problems.

892
01:20:23,093 --> 01:20:28,097
Well, wouldn't it be nice if my problems
and your plans were somehow connected?

893
01:20:28,265 --> 01:20:30,558
Then we could always stay close
to each other...

894
01:20:30,725 --> 01:20:32,977
...and not have to go off
in separate directions.

895
01:20:33,144 --> 01:20:35,855
Togetherness. You know what I mean?

896
01:20:39,276 --> 01:20:41,735
Go ahead, it can't be for me.

897
01:20:49,327 --> 01:20:50,828
Hello?

898
01:20:51,288 --> 01:20:52,705
Yes.

899
01:20:52,873 --> 01:20:55,207
No, not yet. I'm not ready.

900
01:20:55,667 --> 01:21:00,379
What time?
I'll meet you. What's the address?

901
01:21:03,133 --> 01:21:05,634
Yes. Goodbye.

902
01:21:07,971 --> 01:21:09,388
Business?

903
01:21:09,556 --> 01:21:12,808
- Yes.
- Industrial-designing business?

904
01:21:16,313 --> 01:21:20,774
All work and no play? A girl like you
should be enjoying herself this evening...

905
01:21:20,942 --> 01:21:24,320
...instead of taking phone calls
from clients.

906
01:21:25,488 --> 01:21:27,865
What about having dinner with me?

907
01:21:28,033 --> 01:21:32,745
- You can't afford to be seen anyplace.
- Well, let's have it up here. Nice and cozy.

908
01:21:32,913 --> 01:21:34,663
No, I...

909
01:21:35,332 --> 01:21:36,957
I can't.

910
01:21:38,001 --> 01:21:39,877
I insist.

911
01:21:41,171 --> 01:21:43,672
I want you to do a favor for me.

912
01:21:44,215 --> 01:21:46,300
- A big, big favor.
- Name it.

913
01:21:47,510 --> 01:21:49,303
I want you to leave right now.

914
01:21:50,096 --> 01:21:52,765
Stay far away from me
and don't come near me again.

915
01:21:56,186 --> 01:21:57,937
We're not going to get involved.

916
01:21:58,521 --> 01:22:01,190
Last night was last night
and that's all there was.

917
01:22:01,775 --> 01:22:05,027
That's all there is. There isn't going
to be anything more between us.

918
01:22:05,779 --> 01:22:07,571
So, please...

919
01:22:07,739 --> 01:22:08,781
Goodbye.

920
01:22:08,949 --> 01:22:11,700
Good luck. No conversation. Just leave.

921
01:22:12,369 --> 01:22:15,329
- Right away?
- Yes.

922
01:22:15,497 --> 01:22:16,872
No questions asked?

923
01:22:17,290 --> 01:22:18,332
Yes.

924
01:22:20,043 --> 01:22:22,211
- No, I can't do that.
- Please.

925
01:22:23,046 --> 01:22:24,880
- After dinner.
- Now.

926
01:22:25,465 --> 01:22:27,716
After dinner. Fair is fair.

927
01:22:29,552 --> 01:22:31,220
All right.

928
01:22:31,388 --> 01:22:33,430
On one condition.

929
01:22:34,015 --> 01:22:37,685
That you let the hotel valet
do something with this suit first.

930
01:22:37,852 --> 01:22:40,062
You belong in the stockyards
looking like that.

931
01:22:40,230 --> 01:22:41,939
Okay.

932
01:22:43,066 --> 01:22:44,942
There's the phone.

933
01:22:49,406 --> 01:22:52,157
Hello. Valet service, please.

934
01:22:55,912 --> 01:22:57,579
Hello, valet?

935
01:22:58,707 --> 01:23:02,126
- Oh, this is r... Where are we?
- Four sixty-three.

936
01:23:02,293 --> 01:23:04,086
Room 463.

937
01:23:04,254 --> 01:23:06,672
How quickly can you get a suit
sponged and pressed?

938
01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:08,590
Yes, fast.

939
01:23:08,758 --> 01:23:13,262
Twenty minutes? Fine. Okay, 463.

940
01:23:15,932 --> 01:23:17,349
He'll be right up.

941
01:23:17,517 --> 01:23:19,810
Better take your things off.

942
01:23:22,647 --> 01:23:25,983
Now, what could a man do
with his clothes off for 20 minutes?

943
01:23:26,151 --> 01:23:27,693
Couldn't he have taken an hour?

944
01:23:27,861 --> 01:23:29,820
You could always take a cold shower.

945
01:23:29,988 --> 01:23:31,739
That's right.

946
01:23:32,615 --> 01:23:36,118
You know, when I was a little boy,
I wouldn't even let my mother undress me.

947
01:23:36,286 --> 01:23:38,996
- You're a big boy now.
- Yes.

948
01:23:42,167 --> 01:23:46,128
Tell me, how does a girl like you
get to be a girl like you?

949
01:23:47,464 --> 01:23:48,797
Lucky, I guess.

950
01:23:49,299 --> 01:23:53,635
Oh, not lucky. Naughty. Wicked.
Up to no good. Ever kill anyone?

951
01:23:55,221 --> 01:23:58,557
Because I bet you could tease a man
to death without half-trying.

952
01:23:58,725 --> 01:24:00,434
So stop trying, huh?

953
01:24:10,987 --> 01:24:12,988
Be with you in a minute.

954
01:24:16,926 --> 01:24:19,870
Trousers, please.

955
01:24:20,538 --> 01:24:22,122
There you are.

956
01:24:26,878 --> 01:24:28,670
Thank you.

957
01:24:29,339 --> 01:24:32,007
I think I'll take that cold shower after all.

958
01:24:32,175 --> 01:24:33,342
Good.

959
01:25:44,122 --> 01:25:46,790
This magnificent pair
of Louis XVI fauteuils.

960
01:25:46,958 --> 01:25:50,586
Original gilt finish.
Upholstered in pure silk damask.

961
01:25:50,753 --> 01:25:53,714
How much may I say to start?
What am I bid?

962
01:25:53,882 --> 01:25:56,758
One hundred.
One hundred is bid. Thank you.

963
01:25:56,926 --> 01:25:59,386
One-fifty is bid here. Say the 200?

964
01:25:59,554 --> 01:26:00,762
Thank you, 200 is bid.

965
01:26:00,930 --> 01:26:06,018
Say the 300? I have 300.
Four hundred by the little lady.

966
01:26:06,186 --> 01:26:07,227
Thank you, sir.

967
01:26:07,395 --> 01:26:09,730
Four-fifty is bid for the pair.
Can I hear 500?

968
01:26:09,898 --> 01:26:11,440
Will you say 500?

969
01:26:11,608 --> 01:26:13,525
Can I say the 500?

970
01:26:13,693 --> 01:26:15,611
Fair warning and last call.

971
01:26:15,778 --> 01:26:20,282
Sold to Mr. Stone, second row.
Four hundred and fifty dollars.

972
01:26:24,370 --> 01:26:27,206
And now lot number 103.

973
01:26:27,874 --> 01:26:29,708
This lovely Aubusson settee.

974
01:26:29,876 --> 01:26:33,670
In excellent condition.
Please start the bidding.

975
01:26:33,838 --> 01:26:35,464
How much?

976
01:26:35,632 --> 01:26:39,551
Eight hundred is offered, thank you.
Eight hundred is bid. Say the nine? Go 900?

977
01:26:39,719 --> 01:26:42,137
Nine hundred is bid.
Now, who'll say 1,000?

978
01:26:42,805 --> 01:26:46,141
One thousand, thank you.
One thousand at 1,000. Say 1,100?

979
01:26:46,309 --> 01:26:50,729
- Can I hear 1,100? Selling at $1,000.
- The three of you together.

980
01:26:50,897 --> 01:26:53,857
Now, that's a picture
only Charles Addams could draw.

981
01:26:54,025 --> 01:26:55,651
Good evening, Mr. Kaplan.

982
01:26:55,818 --> 01:26:58,904
Before we start calling
each other names, you better tell me yours.

983
01:26:59,072 --> 01:27:01,990
- I haven't had the pleasure.
- You disappoint me, sir.

984
01:27:02,700 --> 01:27:04,534
I was just going to say that to her.

985
01:27:04,702 --> 01:27:07,579
I've always understood
you were a shrewd fellow at your job.

986
01:27:07,747 --> 01:27:10,582
What possessed you
to come blundering in here like this?

987
01:27:10,750 --> 01:27:12,960
Could it be an overpowering interest
in art?

988
01:27:13,127 --> 01:27:15,837
Yes. The art of survival.

989
01:27:16,881 --> 01:27:19,174
Well, have you poured
any good drunks lately?

990
01:27:19,759 --> 01:27:22,427
One hundred dollars.
- He followed me here from the hotel.

991
01:27:23,513 --> 01:27:25,222
He was in your room?

992
01:27:25,390 --> 01:27:26,932
Sure, isn't everybody?

993
01:27:27,517 --> 01:27:29,935
One hundred and fifty. Thank you.
Now, say the two.

994
01:27:30,103 --> 01:27:32,062
Do I hear two? Two hundred, thank you.

995
01:27:32,230 --> 01:27:35,190
Now the three. Do I hear three?
Three hundred, anyone?

996
01:27:35,358 --> 01:27:38,944
Three hundred, thank you. Now, the four.
Do I hear four? Four hundred, anyone?

997
01:27:39,654 --> 01:27:43,573
Four hundred is bid. Say the five?
I have 400. I have 400.

998
01:27:43,741 --> 01:27:47,494
I didn't realize you were an art collector.
I thought you just collected corpses.

999
01:27:48,705 --> 01:27:51,498
- Five hundred.
Five hundred, thank you.

1000
01:27:51,666 --> 01:27:54,584
I'll bet you paid plenty
for this little piece of sculpture.

1001
01:27:54,752 --> 01:27:57,212
Now the seven. Seven hundred?
- Seven hundred.

1002
01:27:57,630 --> 01:28:00,007
She's worth every dollar of it,
take it from me.

1003
01:28:00,967 --> 01:28:03,051
Now, she puts her heart into her work.

1004
01:28:03,219 --> 01:28:05,679
In fact, her whole body.

1005
01:28:05,847 --> 01:28:08,056
Sold to Mr. Vandamm at 700.

1006
01:28:08,641 --> 01:28:13,729
- Number 106 for your pleasure.
- Oh, Mr. Vandamm.

1007
01:28:13,896 --> 01:28:17,607
Has anyone ever told you that you overplay
your various roles rather severely...

1008
01:28:17,775 --> 01:28:19,067
...Mr. Kaplan?

1009
01:28:19,235 --> 01:28:21,445
First, you're the outraged
Madison Avenue man...

1010
01:28:21,612 --> 01:28:23,905
...who claims he's been mistaken
for someone else.

1011
01:28:24,407 --> 01:28:25,907
Then, you play the fugitive...

1012
01:28:26,075 --> 01:28:29,578
...supposedly trying to clear his name
of a crime he knows he didn't commit.

1013
01:28:29,746 --> 01:28:34,499
Now you play the peevish lover,
stung by jealousy and betrayal.

1014
01:28:35,293 --> 01:28:38,170
It seems you fellows could stand
less training from the FBI...

1015
01:28:38,338 --> 01:28:41,298
...and more from the Actors Studio.
Three-fifty I have.

1016
01:28:41,466 --> 01:28:45,093
Apparently, the only performance
that'll satisfy you is when I play dead.

1017
01:28:45,595 --> 01:28:48,430
Your very next role.
You'll be quite convincing, I assure you.

1018
01:28:48,598 --> 01:28:52,059
Don't lose it for $25.
Thank you. Three-seventy-five is bid.

1019
01:28:52,226 --> 01:28:54,269
I have 375, go the 400.

1020
01:28:54,437 --> 01:28:56,897
Three-seventy-five, go four?
Four hundred is bid.

1021
01:28:57,065 --> 01:29:01,401
I wonder what subtle form of manslaughter
is next on the program.

1022
01:29:01,569 --> 01:29:03,987
Am I to be dropped
into a vat of molten steel...

1023
01:29:04,155 --> 01:29:06,823
...and become part of a new skyscraper?

1024
01:29:06,991 --> 01:29:11,870
Or are you going to ask this female
to kiss me again and poison me to death?

1025
01:29:12,038 --> 01:29:14,206
We offer catalog number 107.

1026
01:29:14,374 --> 01:29:18,627
Who are you kidding?
You have no feelings to hurt.

1027
01:29:21,964 --> 01:29:24,716
How much to start the bidding
on this collector's porcelain?

1028
01:29:24,884 --> 01:29:26,051
Please start the bidding.

1029
01:29:26,219 --> 01:29:28,261
Kaplan, we've had just about enough
of you.

1030
01:29:28,429 --> 01:29:30,389
Then, why don't you send for the police?

1031
01:29:32,100 --> 01:29:35,560
That's the last thing you'd want, isn't it?
Me in the hands of the police.

1032
01:29:35,728 --> 01:29:37,771
There's something I might tell them.

1033
01:29:37,939 --> 01:29:40,649
That's the reason you had this one
hustle me on the train.

1034
01:29:40,817 --> 01:29:44,653
Something seems to tell me
I've got a better chance if I go to the police.

1035
01:29:46,239 --> 01:29:48,573
Good night, sweetheart.
Don't think it wasn't nice.

1036
01:29:48,741 --> 01:29:53,662
Say the 12. Twelve hundred dollars
there. Twelve hundred is bid. Say 1300?

1037
01:29:53,955 --> 01:29:55,747
May I hear 1300?

1038
01:29:55,915 --> 01:29:58,750
They're selling at 1200.
Do I hear 1300, please?

1039
01:29:59,669 --> 01:30:01,461
Last call.

1040
01:30:01,629 --> 01:30:05,382
Sold. Twelve hundred dollars. Thank you.

1041
01:30:11,305 --> 01:30:13,598
And now catalog number 109.

1042
01:30:14,517 --> 01:30:18,437
This superb example
of this early 17th century master.

1043
01:30:18,604 --> 01:30:20,856
It will enhance any collection of fine art.

1044
01:30:21,524 --> 01:30:24,651
What is your pleasure?
How much to start?

1045
01:30:24,819 --> 01:30:28,363
One thousand dollars.
One thousand is bid.

1046
01:30:28,531 --> 01:30:31,533
Twelve-fifty I have. Now, 1500.

1047
01:30:32,243 --> 01:30:35,287
Fifteen hundred is bid. Thank you.
Seventeen-fifty?

1048
01:30:37,206 --> 01:30:39,458
- I have 1750.
Two thousand dollars.

1049
01:30:39,625 --> 01:30:44,045
Two thousand is bid. I have 2000.
Do I hear 2500?

1050
01:30:44,213 --> 01:30:46,339
Twenty-five hundred, anyone?

1051
01:30:46,507 --> 01:30:47,549
Twenty-two-fifty once.

1052
01:30:49,260 --> 01:30:51,052
Twenty-two-fifty twice.

1053
01:30:51,220 --> 01:30:54,181
- Last call.
- Fifteen hundred.

1054
01:30:55,099 --> 01:30:59,311
- Well, the bid is already up to 2250, sir.
- I still say 1,500.

1055
01:31:01,647 --> 01:31:05,817
I have 2250. Do I hear 25?

1056
01:31:05,985 --> 01:31:09,696
- Twenty-two-fifty once, 2250 twice.
- Twelve hundred.

1057
01:31:09,864 --> 01:31:14,367
- Sold for 2250. And now...
- Twenty-two-fifty for that chromo?

1058
01:31:18,873 --> 01:31:21,249
Number 110 in the catalog.

1059
01:31:21,667 --> 01:31:24,878
A Louis XV carved
and gilded lit de repos.

1060
01:31:25,046 --> 01:31:27,964
Would somebody start the bidding
at $750, please?

1061
01:31:28,132 --> 01:31:30,884
How do we know it's not a fake?
It looks like a fake.

1062
01:31:34,263 --> 01:31:38,558
Well, one thing we know:
You're no fake. You're a genuine idiot.

1063
01:31:38,726 --> 01:31:40,268
Thank you.

1064
01:31:40,436 --> 01:31:42,854
I wonder if I could respectfully ask
the gentleman...

1065
01:31:43,022 --> 01:31:45,106
...to get into the spirit
of the proceedings.

1066
01:31:45,274 --> 01:31:46,858
All right. I'll start it at 8.

1067
01:31:47,985 --> 01:31:50,946
Eight hundred. Thank you. Nine hundred?

1068
01:31:51,614 --> 01:31:54,616
- One thousand is bid. Go 12?
- Eleven.

1069
01:31:55,117 --> 01:31:58,119
Eleven is bid. Thank you. Go 12.

1070
01:31:58,287 --> 01:32:01,790
I have 11. Go 12. Who'll say 12?

1071
01:32:01,958 --> 01:32:04,167
Eleven once. Who'll say 12?

1072
01:32:04,335 --> 01:32:06,962
Eleven twice. Twelve, thank you.

1073
01:32:07,129 --> 01:32:10,340
Twelve is bid. I have 12. Go 13.
Who'll say 13?

1074
01:32:10,508 --> 01:32:11,633
Thirteen dollars.

1075
01:32:14,303 --> 01:32:15,762
You mean 1300, sir.

1076
01:32:16,806 --> 01:32:19,474
No, no, no, I mean $13.
That's more than it's worth.

1077
01:32:22,228 --> 01:32:23,603
I...

1078
01:32:23,771 --> 01:32:27,774
I have 1200. Go 13. Who'll say 13?

1079
01:32:28,359 --> 01:32:30,235
Who'll say 1250?

1080
01:32:32,488 --> 01:32:35,448
Twelve hundred once, 1200 twice.

1081
01:32:35,616 --> 01:32:37,826
- Last call. Twelve hundred.
- Two thousand.

1082
01:32:41,372 --> 01:32:42,414
Two thousand?

1083
01:32:44,500 --> 01:32:45,500
Twenty-one hundred.

1084
01:32:46,961 --> 01:32:48,378
I'm sorry, sir, but we can't...

1085
01:32:48,546 --> 01:32:50,964
- Make it 2500.
Ask him to leave.

1086
01:32:55,720 --> 01:32:59,764
- Would the gentleman please cooperate?
- The last bid was 1200.

1087
01:32:59,932 --> 01:33:03,351
Twenty-five hundred.
My money's as good as anybody's.

1088
01:33:03,853 --> 01:33:06,187
- Well, isn't it? Isn't it?
- I have...

1089
01:33:06,355 --> 01:33:08,690
- What was it?
- Twelve hundred.

1090
01:33:08,858 --> 01:33:12,110
I have 1200 once, 1200 twice.

1091
01:33:12,278 --> 01:33:15,697
- Three thousand.
Sold for 1200.

1092
01:33:18,075 --> 01:33:21,202
- I'm not gonna let you get away with that.
- You'd better leave, sir.

1093
01:33:21,370 --> 01:33:23,538
No, you take your hands off me
or I'll sue you.

1094
01:33:38,054 --> 01:33:40,347
- What took you so long?
- Let's take a little walk.

1095
01:33:40,514 --> 01:33:42,724
- Get moving.
- I haven't finished bidding yet.

1096
01:33:42,892 --> 01:33:45,560
Three thousand. I bid 3000.

1097
01:33:45,728 --> 01:33:48,480
I'm sorry, old man. Too bad. Keep trying.

1098
01:33:49,732 --> 01:33:51,733
Not so rough.

1099
01:33:59,700 --> 01:34:01,868
- Handle with care, fellas.
- In there.

1100
01:34:02,036 --> 01:34:04,412
- I'm valuable property.
- In.

1101
01:34:07,917 --> 01:34:12,045
Well, I want to thank you for saving my life.
Thank you, my friend. Thank you.

1102
01:34:12,213 --> 01:34:14,589
Save it for the station house.

1103
01:34:18,928 --> 01:34:21,513
Well, let's have some smiles
and good cheer.

1104
01:34:21,681 --> 01:34:25,600
You're about to become heroes.
Don't you know who I am?

1105
01:34:25,768 --> 01:34:29,688
We'll find out as soon as we book you
for being drunk and disorderly.

1106
01:34:29,855 --> 01:34:33,191
Drunk and disorderly? That's chicken feed.
You've hit the jackpot.

1107
01:34:33,359 --> 01:34:37,862
Chicago police capture
United Nations killer.

1108
01:34:38,030 --> 01:34:39,989
My name is Roger Thornhill.

1109
01:34:40,491 --> 01:34:41,950
Here.

1110
01:34:45,454 --> 01:34:48,456
- It's him.
- That's right. Congratulations, man.

1111
01:34:49,166 --> 01:34:50,208
Yeah.

1112
01:34:50,376 --> 01:34:52,627
This is 1055. Sergeant Flamm.

1113
01:34:52,795 --> 01:34:57,006
We've got a man here who answers
to the description of Thornhill, Roger.

1114
01:34:57,174 --> 01:34:58,842
Code 76.

1115
01:34:59,009 --> 01:35:02,971
Wanted by NYPD. Positive ID.

1116
01:35:03,639 --> 01:35:05,140
Absolutely. No question.

1117
01:35:07,017 --> 01:35:10,228
Michigan Avenue.
Proceeding north to 42nd precinct.

1118
01:35:13,357 --> 01:35:14,941
What?

1119
01:35:16,360 --> 01:35:17,402
Come again?

1120
01:35:20,030 --> 01:35:21,614
Are you sure?

1121
01:35:22,658 --> 01:35:24,367
Okay. Right.

1122
01:35:24,535 --> 01:35:26,035
Yeah, I got it.

1123
01:35:26,203 --> 01:35:28,580
One-oh-five-five, off and clear.

1124
01:35:30,541 --> 01:35:32,667
- Where are we going?
- Airport.

1125
01:35:33,335 --> 01:35:35,628
- For what?
- Orders.

1126
01:35:35,796 --> 01:35:38,006
Airport? I don't wanna be taken
to an airport.

1127
01:35:38,174 --> 01:35:42,010
- I want to be taken to police headquarters.
- You do, huh?

1128
01:35:42,178 --> 01:35:43,845
Why do you think I sent for you?

1129
01:35:44,013 --> 01:35:46,931
How about this guy, Charlie?
He sent for us.

1130
01:35:47,099 --> 01:35:48,933
- Sit back.
- Didn't you hear what I said?

1131
01:35:49,101 --> 01:35:52,228
I want to be taken to police headquarters.
I'm a dangerous assassin.

1132
01:35:52,396 --> 01:35:56,524
- I'm a mad killer on the loose.
- You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

1133
01:36:22,760 --> 01:36:23,885
They said right here.

1134
01:36:24,053 --> 01:36:27,388
Does anyone mind if I sit down?
I've been running all day.

1135
01:36:38,567 --> 01:36:41,694
Thought I'd never make it.
Getting too old for this kind of work.

1136
01:36:42,279 --> 01:36:43,655
All right, men. Thank you.

1137
01:36:44,240 --> 01:36:46,074
- This way, Mr. Thornhill.
- Wait a minute.

1138
01:36:46,242 --> 01:36:49,702
We haven't much time.
Yeah, this way is more private.

1139
01:36:53,415 --> 01:36:57,377
- I don't think I caught your name.
- I don't think I pitched it.

1140
01:36:57,920 --> 01:37:00,421
You're police, aren't you? Or is it FBI?

1141
01:37:00,589 --> 01:37:02,382
FBI, CIA, ONI.

1142
01:37:02,550 --> 01:37:04,884
- We're all in the same alphabet soup.
- Really?

1143
01:37:05,052 --> 01:37:09,013
You can stick this in your alphabet soup.
I had nothing to do with that killing.

1144
01:37:09,181 --> 01:37:11,307
- We know that.
- You know it?

1145
01:37:11,475 --> 01:37:14,143
Then why did you let the police
chase me all over the map?

1146
01:37:14,311 --> 01:37:18,398
We never interfere with the police,
unless absolutely necessary.

1147
01:37:18,566 --> 01:37:20,942
- It's become necessary.
- Oh, I see.

1148
01:37:21,110 --> 01:37:23,236
Well, then, I take it
I'm going to be cleared.

1149
01:37:23,404 --> 01:37:26,406
I do wish you'd walk faster, Mr. Thornhill.
We'll miss the plane.

1150
01:37:26,574 --> 01:37:28,658
Where are we going?
New York or Washington?

1151
01:37:28,826 --> 01:37:31,077
Rapid City, South Dakota.

1152
01:37:31,245 --> 01:37:34,747
- Rapid City? What for?
- It's near Mount Rushmore.

1153
01:37:34,915 --> 01:37:36,791
No, thank you.
I've seen Mount Rushmore.

1154
01:37:36,959 --> 01:37:39,586
So has your friend Mr. Vandamm.

1155
01:37:39,962 --> 01:37:41,713
Vandamm?

1156
01:37:41,881 --> 01:37:44,632
A rather formidable
kind of gentleman, eh?

1157
01:37:44,800 --> 01:37:47,093
What about that treacherous little tramp
with him?

1158
01:37:47,261 --> 01:37:48,511
- Miss Kendall?
- Yeah.

1159
01:37:48,679 --> 01:37:51,014
His mistress. We know all about her.

1160
01:37:52,516 --> 01:37:54,475
Tell me, what's Vandamm up to?

1161
01:37:54,643 --> 01:37:57,520
Oh, you could say he's a sort
of importer-exporter.

1162
01:37:57,688 --> 01:37:59,022
Of what?

1163
01:37:59,189 --> 01:38:01,983
Oh. Government secrets, perhaps.

1164
01:38:02,568 --> 01:38:04,319
Well, then why don't you grab him?

1165
01:38:04,486 --> 01:38:07,322
There's still too much we don't know
about his organization.

1166
01:38:07,489 --> 01:38:08,823
Oh, I see.

1167
01:38:08,991 --> 01:38:11,242
What's all this got to do
with Mount Rushmore?

1168
01:38:11,410 --> 01:38:13,745
Well, Vandamm has a place near there.

1169
01:38:13,913 --> 01:38:17,248
We think it's his jumping-off point
to leave the country tomorrow night.

1170
01:38:17,416 --> 01:38:19,834
- Are you gonna stop him?
- No.

1171
01:38:20,002 --> 01:38:21,836
Well, then what are we going there for?

1172
01:38:22,004 --> 01:38:24,005
To set his mind at ease
about George Kaplan.

1173
01:38:25,758 --> 01:38:28,509
Oh, you, huh?
You're George Kaplan, aren't you?

1174
01:38:28,677 --> 01:38:31,846
Oh, no, Mr. Thornhill.
There is no such person as George Kaplan.

1175
01:38:32,014 --> 01:38:33,890
What do you mean? I've been in his room.

1176
01:38:34,058 --> 01:38:36,976
I've tried on his clothes.
He's got short sleeves and dandruff.

1177
01:38:37,144 --> 01:38:39,854
Believe me, Mr. Thornhill,
he doesn't exist.

1178
01:38:40,022 --> 01:38:45,944
Which is why I'm gonna have to ask you
to go on being him for the next 24 hours.

1179
01:38:46,111 --> 01:38:48,529
Come on. We'll discuss it on the plane.

1180
01:39:09,885 --> 01:39:14,138
Now, look. You started this decoy business
without me, you finish it without me.

1181
01:39:14,306 --> 01:39:16,391
We might have
if you hadn't stumbled into it.

1182
01:39:16,558 --> 01:39:20,228
You ought to give me a medal
instead of asking me to be a target...

1183
01:39:20,396 --> 01:39:23,398
...just so your special agent or whatever
doesn't get shot at.

1184
01:39:23,565 --> 01:39:28,611
Not shot at, Mr. Thornhill. Found out.
Once found out, they're as good as dead.

1185
01:39:28,779 --> 01:39:32,573
Thanks to you,
clouds of suspicion are already forming.

1186
01:39:32,741 --> 01:39:34,325
Thanks to me?

1187
01:39:34,493 --> 01:39:36,911
- If you'll get on the plane...
- You listen to me.

1188
01:39:37,079 --> 01:39:41,666
I'm an advertising man, not a red herring.
I've got a job, a secretary, a mother...

1189
01:39:41,834 --> 01:39:44,585
...two ex-wives and several bartenders
dependent upon me...

1190
01:39:44,753 --> 01:39:48,047
...and I don't intend to disappoint them all
by getting myself killed.

1191
01:39:48,215 --> 01:39:50,466
The answer is no.

1192
01:39:50,634 --> 01:39:52,927
- Is that final?
- Yes.

1193
01:39:53,095 --> 01:39:55,179
- Goodbye, then.
- Goodbye.

1194
01:39:55,347 --> 01:39:58,850
If there was a chance of changing
your mind I'd talk about Miss Kendall.

1195
01:39:59,935 --> 01:40:01,769
Of whom you so obviously disapprove.

1196
01:40:01,937 --> 01:40:05,440
Yes, for using sex
like some people use a fly swatter.

1197
01:40:06,025 --> 01:40:07,942
I don't suppose it would matter to you...

1198
01:40:08,110 --> 01:40:12,113
...that she was probably forced to do
whatever she did to protect herself.

1199
01:40:12,281 --> 01:40:14,490
To protect herself from what?

1200
01:40:14,658 --> 01:40:17,535
Exposure and assassination.

1201
01:40:18,579 --> 01:40:20,788
You see, Mr. Thornhill, she...

1202
01:40:21,457 --> 01:40:23,332
She's one of our agents.

1203
01:40:24,334 --> 01:40:26,836
- Oh, no.
- I know you didn't mean it...

1204
01:40:27,004 --> 01:40:31,591
...but I'm afraid you have put her
in an extremely dangerous situation.

1205
01:40:32,968 --> 01:40:35,344
And much more than her life is at stake.

1206
01:40:49,985 --> 01:40:53,237
- Suppose they don't come?
- They'll come.

1207
01:40:54,865 --> 01:40:58,159
I don't like the way
Teddy Roosevelt is looking at me.

1208
01:40:58,327 --> 01:41:02,205
Perhaps he's trying to give you
one last word of caution, Mr. Kaplan.

1209
01:41:02,372 --> 01:41:04,415
Speak soft, and carry a big stick.

1210
01:41:04,833 --> 01:41:08,086
He's trying to tell me not to go through
with this harebrained scheme.

1211
01:41:08,253 --> 01:41:11,506
He doesn't know to what extent
you're the cause of our present trouble.

1212
01:41:12,007 --> 01:41:14,675
I don't know that I care
to accept that charge, professor.

1213
01:41:14,843 --> 01:41:18,262
Dear, fellow, if you hadn't made yourself
so attractive to Miss Kendall...

1214
01:41:18,430 --> 01:41:20,890
...that she fell for you...
- And vice versa.

1215
01:41:21,058 --> 01:41:24,352
- Our friend Vandamm wouldn't
be losing faith in her loyalty now.

1216
01:41:24,895 --> 01:41:28,689
It was quite obvious to him last night
that she had become emotionally involved.

1217
01:41:28,857 --> 01:41:33,111
Worst of all, with a man he thinks
is a government agent.

1218
01:41:33,570 --> 01:41:35,780
Are you trying to tell me
that I'm irresistible?

1219
01:41:35,948 --> 01:41:39,450
I'm trying to remind you it is your
responsibility to help us restore her...

1220
01:41:39,618 --> 01:41:41,035
...to Vandamm's good graces...

1221
01:41:41,203 --> 01:41:44,205
...right up to the point
he leaves the country tonight.

1222
01:41:44,373 --> 01:41:45,706
All right, all right.

1223
01:41:46,250 --> 01:41:47,875
But, after tonight...

1224
01:41:48,877 --> 01:41:50,878
My blessings on you both.

1225
01:42:05,394 --> 01:42:07,019
Here they are.

1226
01:43:00,532 --> 01:43:03,534
- Good afternoon, Mr. Kaplan.
- Not her.

1227
01:43:12,669 --> 01:43:15,421
Did I misunderstand you
about bringing her here?

1228
01:43:15,589 --> 01:43:17,798
We'll get to that later.

1229
01:43:18,550 --> 01:43:20,593
I suppose you were surprised
to get my call.

1230
01:43:20,761 --> 01:43:24,597
Not at all. I knew the police
would release you, Mr. Kaplan.

1231
01:43:24,765 --> 01:43:27,642
By the way, I want to compliment you
on your colorful exit...

1232
01:43:27,809 --> 01:43:29,977
...from the auction gallery.

1233
01:43:30,145 --> 01:43:31,312
Thank you.

1234
01:43:31,480 --> 01:43:34,440
And now, what little drama
are we here for today?

1235
01:43:34,608 --> 01:43:38,361
I don't for a moment believe that you've
invited me to these gay surroundings...

1236
01:43:38,528 --> 01:43:40,905
...to come to a business arrangement.

1237
01:43:42,491 --> 01:43:46,702
Suppose I tell you I not only know the exact
time you're leaving the country tonight...

1238
01:43:46,870 --> 01:43:49,413
...but the latitude and longitude
of your rendezvous...

1239
01:43:49,581 --> 01:43:51,832
...and your ultimate destination.

1240
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,669
You wouldn't care to carry my bags for me,
would you?

1241
01:43:54,836 --> 01:43:58,089
Perhaps you'd be interested in the price,
just the same.

1242
01:43:58,257 --> 01:44:01,842
- The price?
- For doing nothing to stop you.

1243
01:44:03,053 --> 01:44:05,346
How much did you have in mind?

1244
01:44:06,014 --> 01:44:07,765
I want the girl.

1245
01:44:10,060 --> 01:44:12,937
I want the girl to get
what's coming to her.

1246
01:44:13,105 --> 01:44:16,482
Turn her over to me, I'll see there's
enough pinned on her to keep her...

1247
01:44:16,650 --> 01:44:19,360
...uncomfortable for the rest of her life.

1248
01:44:20,195 --> 01:44:23,072
You do that,
and I'll look the other way tonight.

1249
01:44:23,615 --> 01:44:25,616
She really did get under your skin.

1250
01:44:25,784 --> 01:44:28,619
We're not talking about my skin.
We're talking about yours.

1251
01:44:28,787 --> 01:44:32,790
- I'm offering you a chance to save it.
To exchange it.

1252
01:44:33,542 --> 01:44:34,709
Put it any way you like.

1253
01:44:35,210 --> 01:44:37,712
I'm curious, Mr. Kaplan.

1254
01:44:37,879 --> 01:44:41,299
What made you arrive at the deduction that
my feelings for Miss Kendall...

1255
01:44:41,466 --> 01:44:46,804
...have deteriorated to the point where
I would trade her in for peace of mind?

1256
01:44:46,972 --> 01:44:50,057
I don't deduce. I observe.

1257
01:44:52,394 --> 01:44:55,855
Phillip, if you don't mind,
I'm going back to the house now.

1258
01:45:08,118 --> 01:45:09,243
Just a second, you.

1259
01:45:09,411 --> 01:45:13,039
Stay away from me. Let go.
Let go of me.

1260
01:45:13,582 --> 01:45:15,499
Stay away from me. Let go.

1261
01:45:15,667 --> 01:45:17,335
Let go of me.

1262
01:45:17,502 --> 01:45:21,255
- Now, save the phony tears.
- You just get back.

1263
01:45:22,799 --> 01:45:26,010
- You little fool.
- You just stay away from me.

1264
01:45:31,391 --> 01:45:33,601
No good, sir.
You can't get involved in this.

1265
01:45:38,106 --> 01:45:40,107
- Don't touch anything.
- Stand back.

1266
01:45:40,275 --> 01:45:41,359
Stand back.

1267
01:46:33,120 --> 01:46:34,995
Mr. Thornhill?

1268
01:46:42,838 --> 01:46:44,338
Don't be long.

1269
01:46:48,009 --> 01:46:49,802
Hello.

1270
01:46:50,387 --> 01:46:51,887
Hello.

1271
01:46:52,055 --> 01:46:53,889
Are you all right?

1272
01:46:54,891 --> 01:46:56,725
Yes, I think so.

1273
01:46:56,893 --> 01:46:59,728
I asked the professor
if I could see you again.

1274
01:47:02,190 --> 01:47:04,066
There's not much time.

1275
01:47:05,527 --> 01:47:06,861
Isn’t there?

1276
01:47:07,737 --> 01:47:09,822
I wanted to tell you...

1277
01:47:09,990 --> 01:47:11,282
I mean, apologize.

1278
01:47:12,868 --> 01:47:14,368
No need.

1279
01:47:15,537 --> 01:47:17,288
I understand.

1280
01:47:19,291 --> 01:47:21,375
All in the line of duty.

1281
01:47:22,544 --> 01:47:24,837
I did treat you miserably.

1282
01:47:25,172 --> 01:47:26,714
I, uh...

1283
01:47:26,882 --> 01:47:28,966
I hated you for it.

1284
01:47:29,134 --> 01:47:31,469
I didn't want you to go on
thinking that I...

1285
01:47:32,971 --> 01:47:36,724
And I... I used some pretty harsh words.
I'm sorry.

1286
01:47:36,892 --> 01:47:38,726
They hurt deeply.

1287
01:47:38,894 --> 01:47:42,104
- Well, naturally, if I'd known...
- I couldn't tell you.

1288
01:47:42,731 --> 01:47:44,023
- Of course not.
- Could I?

1289
01:47:45,942 --> 01:47:47,318
No, I guess not.

1290
01:47:49,404 --> 01:47:52,531
You didn't get hurt. I'm so relieved.
- Of course I was hurt.

1291
01:47:52,699 --> 01:47:55,409
- How would you have felt?
- In the cafeteria, when you fell.

1292
01:47:55,577 --> 01:47:59,079
- When I shot you with the blanks.
- Oh, that. No.

1293
01:47:59,748 --> 01:48:04,084
You did it rather well, I thought.
- Yes, I thought I was quite graceful.

1294
01:48:04,628 --> 01:48:07,755
Considering
it's not really your kind of work.

1295
01:48:08,590 --> 01:48:12,843
Well, I got into it by accident.
What's your excuse?

1296
01:48:14,179 --> 01:48:18,641
I met Phillip Vandamm at a party one night
and saw only his charm.

1297
01:48:18,808 --> 01:48:20,267
Oh.

1298
01:48:21,478 --> 01:48:24,271
I guess I had nothing to do
that weekend, so I...

1299
01:48:24,439 --> 01:48:26,774
I decided to fall in love.

1300
01:48:27,359 --> 01:48:29,568
Well, that's nice.

1301
01:48:30,487 --> 01:48:35,282
Eventually, the professor and his
Washington colleagues approached me...

1302
01:48:35,992 --> 01:48:40,454
...with a few sordid details about Phillip
and he told me that...

1303
01:48:40,622 --> 01:48:44,583
...my relationship with him
made me uniquely valuable to them.

1304
01:48:46,378 --> 01:48:49,255
So you became a Girl Scout, huh?

1305
01:48:49,422 --> 01:48:52,883
Maybe it was the first time anyone
ever asked me to do anything worthwhile.

1306
01:48:55,303 --> 01:48:56,720
Has life been like that?

1307
01:48:59,975 --> 01:49:01,475
How come?

1308
01:49:03,478 --> 01:49:05,479
Men like you.

1309
01:49:06,481 --> 01:49:08,816
What's wrong with men like me?

1310
01:49:09,109 --> 01:49:11,235
They don't believe in marriage.

1311
01:49:11,403 --> 01:49:13,153
I've been married twice.

1312
01:49:13,321 --> 01:49:14,446
See what I mean?

1313
01:49:16,700 --> 01:49:19,660
I may go back to hating you.
It was more fun.

1314
01:49:26,418 --> 01:49:27,918
Goodbye, darling.

1315
01:49:29,296 --> 01:49:32,548
- Wait a minute. Not so soon.
- No, I gotta get back and convince them...

1316
01:49:32,716 --> 01:49:35,843
...that I took the long way around
so nobody followed me.

1317
01:49:37,679 --> 01:49:39,972
Couldn't we stand like this
for just a few hours?

1318
01:49:40,140 --> 01:49:42,683
Just this time you're supposed
to be critically wounded.

1319
01:49:42,851 --> 01:49:44,852
I never felt more alive.

1320
01:49:45,020 --> 01:49:46,437
Well, whose side are you on?

1321
01:49:47,564 --> 01:49:48,939
Yours, always, darling.

1322
01:49:50,025 --> 01:49:52,943
Please don't undermine my resolve
just when I need it most.

1323
01:50:01,536 --> 01:50:05,831
Oh, well, I guess it's off to the hospital
for me and back to danger for you.

1324
01:50:05,999 --> 01:50:07,708
I don't like it a bit.

1325
01:50:07,876 --> 01:50:11,920
It's much safer now, thanks to you,
my darling decoy.

1326
01:50:12,088 --> 01:50:14,340
Don't thank me. I couldn't stand it.

1327
01:50:14,507 --> 01:50:16,091
All right. I won't.

1328
01:50:16,259 --> 01:50:19,511
After your malevolent friend Vandamm
takes off tonight...

1329
01:50:19,679 --> 01:50:23,849
...you and I are gonna get together and do a
lot of apologizing to each other in private.

1330
01:50:24,017 --> 01:50:27,311
- You know that can't be.
- Of course it can be.

1331
01:50:30,565 --> 01:50:32,733
He has told you, hasn't he?

1332
01:50:33,234 --> 01:50:36,278
- Told me what?
- Miss Kendall, you gotta get moving.

1333
01:50:36,446 --> 01:50:39,740
- Wait a minute. What didn't you tell me?
- Why didn't you?

1334
01:50:40,742 --> 01:50:43,911
She's going off with Vandamm tonight
on the plane.

1335
01:50:45,455 --> 01:50:47,081
She's going off with Vandamm?

1336
01:50:47,248 --> 01:50:50,250
We went to such lengths
to make her a fugitive from justice.

1337
01:50:50,418 --> 01:50:53,420
So that Vandamm couldn't very well decline
to take her along.

1338
01:50:53,588 --> 01:50:56,423
I needn't tell you how valuable
she can be to us over there.

1339
01:50:57,384 --> 01:50:59,426
You lied to me.
You said that after tonight...

1340
01:50:59,594 --> 01:51:02,304
- I needed your help.
- Well, you got it, all right.

1341
01:51:02,472 --> 01:51:03,597
Don't be angry.

1342
01:51:03,765 --> 01:51:06,016
You think I'm gonna let you
go through with this?

1343
01:51:06,184 --> 01:51:08,852
- Oh, she has to.
- Nobody has to do anything.

1344
01:51:09,020 --> 01:51:11,105
I don't like the games
you play, professor.

1345
01:51:12,107 --> 01:51:15,067
War is hell, Mr. Thornhill,
even when it's a cold one.

1346
01:51:15,944 --> 01:51:18,362
If you can't lick the Vandamms
of this world...

1347
01:51:18,822 --> 01:51:21,740
...without asking girls to bed down
and fly away with them...

1348
01:51:21,908 --> 01:51:23,450
...and never come back...

1349
01:51:23,618 --> 01:51:26,286
...perhaps you ought to learn
how to lose a few cold wars.

1350
01:51:26,996 --> 01:51:29,498
I'm afraid we're already doing that.

1351
01:51:35,964 --> 01:51:40,259
- I'm not gonna let you do this. Get out.
- Please don't spoil everything. Please.

1352
01:51:45,348 --> 01:51:49,435
Mr. Kaplan twice in full
view of horrified men, women and children...

1353
01:51:49,602 --> 01:51:52,980
...who had come to the park to see
the famed Mount Rushmore monument.

1354
01:51:53,148 --> 01:51:58,652
Witnesses described Kaplan's assailant
as an attractive blonde in her late twenties.

1355
01:51:58,820 --> 01:52:02,614
Kaplan, who was removed to the
Rapid City Hospital in critical condition...

1356
01:52:02,782 --> 01:52:06,785
...has been tentatively identified
as an employee of the federal government.

1357
01:52:06,953 --> 01:52:09,371
The tragedy developed
with startling suddenness.

1358
01:52:09,539 --> 01:52:12,750
Chris Swenson,
a busboy in the Mount Rushmore cafeteria...

1359
01:52:12,917 --> 01:52:15,919
...stated that he heard voices raised in...

1360
01:52:22,010 --> 01:52:24,011
- Here we are.
- Hello.

1361
01:52:24,179 --> 01:52:26,847
Slacks, a shirt and these.

1362
01:52:27,015 --> 01:52:28,182
Thanks.

1363
01:52:28,349 --> 01:52:31,935
That'll do for you around here
for the next couple of days.

1364
01:52:32,687 --> 01:52:35,022
For the next couple of days?

1365
01:52:35,648 --> 01:52:36,690
- Hey.
- What?

1366
01:52:36,858 --> 01:52:37,941
What's this?

1367
01:52:38,109 --> 01:52:41,236
That's where I hit the chair
doing that phony fall in the cafeteria.

1368
01:52:41,404 --> 01:52:43,572
You and your dopey schemes, shootings.

1369
01:52:43,740 --> 01:52:47,534
- Otherwise, feeling all right?
- Oh, yeah. Fine.

1370
01:52:47,702 --> 01:52:50,829
Considering your driver
has a sledgehammer for a hand.

1371
01:52:50,997 --> 01:52:52,873
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

1372
01:52:53,041 --> 01:52:55,584
No, that's all right. I guess I deserved it.

1373
01:52:56,377 --> 01:52:58,545
I guess I deserve that locked door too.

1374
01:52:58,713 --> 01:53:02,633
You seen wandering about in good health
could've proved fatal to Miss Kendall.

1375
01:53:03,551 --> 01:53:06,553
- I've begun to forget her already.
- Good.

1376
01:53:06,721 --> 01:53:09,223
- Better that way.
- Yeah, much.

1377
01:53:09,390 --> 01:53:12,017
Inside of an hour, she'll be gone.

1378
01:53:14,562 --> 01:53:18,440
- How's everything out in Rapid City?
- Oh, everything's fine.

1379
01:53:18,608 --> 01:53:22,653
Mr. Kaplan's untimely shooting has now
acquired the authority of the printed word.

1380
01:53:22,821 --> 01:53:25,280
Everyone's been cooperating beautifully.

1381
01:53:25,448 --> 01:53:27,032
Well, now you can include me.

1382
01:53:27,742 --> 01:53:29,910
- I'm a cooperator.
- I'm most grateful.

1383
01:53:30,411 --> 01:53:33,497
- Care to do me a favor in return?
- Anything.

1384
01:53:33,665 --> 01:53:36,792
I'd like a drink. Will you get me a...?
Get me some bourbon?

1385
01:53:36,960 --> 01:53:38,502
A pint will do.

1386
01:53:39,003 --> 01:53:40,087
Can I join you?

1387
01:53:40,255 --> 01:53:43,382
Well, if you're gonna join me,
you better make it a quart.

1388
01:53:43,550 --> 01:53:46,385
- See you in a few minutes.
- Yeah.

1389
01:54:50,491 --> 01:54:53,243
- Stop.
- Oh, excuse me.

1390
01:54:53,411 --> 01:54:55,162
Stop.

1391
01:55:18,853 --> 01:55:21,855
- You don't want me to take you up there?
- No, thanks. Never mind.

1392
01:55:22,023 --> 01:55:23,523
Oh, thanks.

1393
01:58:07,980 --> 01:58:11,358
There's nothing to worry about.
I just lost my head.

1394
01:58:11,526 --> 01:58:14,611
I'm not just saying this
to make you feel better.

1395
01:58:14,779 --> 01:58:16,154
I mean it.

1396
01:58:16,322 --> 01:58:18,365
I just didn't know what I was doing.

1397
01:58:18,533 --> 01:58:21,034
He wanted to destroy you.
You had to protect yourself.

1398
01:58:21,202 --> 01:58:23,703
But not endanger you.
Ah, rubbish.

1399
01:58:24,372 --> 01:58:28,542
Soon we'll be off together and I shall
dedicate myself to your happiness.

1400
01:58:30,044 --> 01:58:31,878
What's the situation, Leonard?

1401
01:58:32,046 --> 01:58:34,256
- About the plane, you mean?
- Of course.

1402
01:58:34,423 --> 01:58:36,007
What was the last report?

1403
01:58:36,175 --> 01:58:39,511
Over Whitestone on the hour,
6000, descending.

1404
01:58:39,679 --> 01:58:42,389
About ten minutes, huh?
At the most.

1405
01:58:42,557 --> 01:58:44,474
And now, uh...

1406
01:58:44,642 --> 01:58:47,561
I wonder if I might have a few words
of parting with you, sir?

1407
01:58:47,728 --> 01:58:49,354
Certainly.

1408
01:58:49,730 --> 01:58:51,439
In private?

1409
01:58:52,483 --> 01:58:54,401
I'll go up and get my things.

1410
01:58:54,902 --> 01:58:56,278
Well, Leonard...

1411
01:58:56,445 --> 01:59:00,282
...how does one say goodbye
to one's right arm?

1412
01:59:06,747 --> 01:59:09,374
I'm afraid you're gonna wish
you had cut it off sooner.

1413
01:59:13,963 --> 01:59:16,381
I know how terribly fond you are
of Miss Kendall...

1414
01:59:16,549 --> 01:59:19,467
I don't find this a terribly attractive...

1415
01:59:22,847 --> 01:59:26,057
- She is not to be trusted.
- You're being mysterious.

1416
01:59:26,225 --> 01:59:28,560
I'm not being mysterious at all.

1417
02:00:01,677 --> 02:00:03,678
It couldn't have been anything.

1418
02:00:07,058 --> 02:00:09,809
You must've had some doubts
about her yourself.

1419
02:00:11,312 --> 02:00:13,980
- And still do.
Rubbish.

1420
02:00:14,398 --> 02:00:16,983
Why else would
you have decided not to tell her...

1421
02:00:17,151 --> 02:00:19,945
...that our little treasure here
has a bellyful of microfilm?

1422
02:00:20,112 --> 02:00:22,489
You seem to be trying to fill mine
with rotten apples.

1423
02:00:22,657 --> 02:00:24,658
Sometimes the truth
does taste like worms.

1424
02:00:24,825 --> 02:00:27,118
The truth? I've heard nothing
but innuendoes.

1425
02:00:27,286 --> 02:00:31,122
Call it my woman's intuition if you will,
but I've never trusted neatness.

1426
02:00:31,290 --> 02:00:33,708
Neatness is always the result
of deliberate planning.

1427
02:00:33,876 --> 02:00:36,336
She shot him in a moment
of fear and anger.

1428
02:00:36,504 --> 02:00:39,506
- You were there yourself. You saw it.
Yes.

1429
02:00:41,676 --> 02:00:46,346
And thereby wrapped everything up
into one very neat and tidy bundle.

1430
02:00:48,015 --> 02:00:50,892
A, she removed any doubts
you may have had about her, uh...

1431
02:00:51,060 --> 02:00:53,853
Now, what did you call it, her devotion?

1432
02:00:54,021 --> 02:00:58,275
B, she gave herself a new and urgent reason
to be taken to the other side with you...

1433
02:00:58,442 --> 02:01:01,653
...in case you decided to change your mind.
- You know what I think?

1434
02:01:03,072 --> 02:01:04,572
I think you're jealous.

1435
02:01:04,740 --> 02:01:07,867
No, I mean it,
and I'm very touched. Very...

1436
02:01:10,329 --> 02:01:11,913
Leonard!

1437
02:01:19,213 --> 02:01:20,714
The gun she shot Kaplan with.

1438
02:01:21,716 --> 02:01:23,216
I found it in her luggage.

1439
02:01:24,468 --> 02:01:28,221
It's an old trick. Shoot one of your own
to show that you're not one of them.

1440
02:01:28,973 --> 02:01:31,850
They've just freshened it up a bit
with blank cartridges.

1441
02:01:45,990 --> 02:01:47,073
What was that noise?

1442
02:01:50,077 --> 02:01:53,330
Yes, we wondered what it was too.
Didn't we, Leonard?

1443
02:01:54,415 --> 02:01:56,374
Hurry, darling. It's almost time to leave.

1444
02:01:56,959 --> 02:01:58,043
In a moment.

1445
02:02:07,261 --> 02:02:09,596
You're not taking her on that plane
with you?

1446
02:02:09,764 --> 02:02:11,056
Of course I am.

1447
02:02:12,099 --> 02:02:15,685
Like our friends,
I too believe in neatness, Leonard.

1448
02:02:15,853 --> 02:02:19,939
This matter is best disposed of
from a great height...

1449
02:02:20,107 --> 02:02:21,608
...over water.

1450
02:03:08,447 --> 02:03:10,448
How about a little champagne
before we go?

1451
02:03:10,616 --> 02:03:11,991
I'd love it.

1452
02:03:12,159 --> 02:03:15,328
It may not be cold enough.
Over the rocks will be all right.

1453
02:03:15,496 --> 02:03:17,038
Are you sure?

1454
02:03:18,165 --> 02:03:19,416
My dear.

1455
02:04:31,780 --> 02:04:33,239
Thank you.

1456
02:04:33,699 --> 02:04:37,202
To you, my dear, and all
the lovely moments we've had together.

1457
02:04:38,454 --> 02:04:39,996
Thank you, Phillip.

1458
02:04:40,414 --> 02:04:41,581
There he is.

1459
02:04:49,173 --> 02:04:51,758
Jump in, Leonard. The champagne's fine.

1460
02:04:51,926 --> 02:04:53,301
There isn't time.

1461
02:04:53,469 --> 02:04:56,429
You always were a spoilsport,
weren't you?

1462
02:04:56,597 --> 02:05:00,266
One of my most
valuable attributes as it now turns out.

1463
02:05:02,436 --> 02:05:06,439
It would please me if you would think of me
as being along on this journey...

1464
02:05:06,941 --> 02:05:10,527
...if only in spirit.
I shall, Leonard.

1465
02:05:17,409 --> 02:05:20,828
He's heading pretty far out
on the north leg and awfully high.

1466
02:05:21,956 --> 02:05:25,208
I guess he's gonna play it safe
with a long, slow descent.

1467
02:05:26,293 --> 02:05:28,503
You couldn't ask
for a better night than this.

1468
02:05:28,671 --> 02:05:31,464
Ceiling and possibilities unlimited.

1469
02:05:33,092 --> 02:05:35,718
Ah, there he goes, starting his turn.

1470
02:05:36,470 --> 02:05:38,304
Well, we better get moving.

1471
02:05:40,140 --> 02:05:43,643
He should have his wheels on the ground
inside of three minutes.

1472
02:05:47,523 --> 02:05:49,941
- Come along, Eve.
All right.

1473
02:05:51,819 --> 02:05:55,488
I think I left my earrings upstairs.
I'll be right down.

1474
02:06:08,335 --> 02:06:10,628
We can get out through the window.
There's a car.

1475
02:06:10,796 --> 02:06:12,755
What are you doing?
You'll ruin everything.

1476
02:06:12,923 --> 02:06:15,842
They know about the shooting.
They're going to do away with you!

1477
02:06:16,010 --> 02:06:19,345
- What are you talking about?
- Leonard found the gun in your luggage.

1478
02:06:19,513 --> 02:06:22,557
The figure they got at the auction
is filled with microfilm.

1479
02:06:22,725 --> 02:06:25,643
- That's how he's been getting it.
Miss Kendall?

1480
02:06:26,186 --> 02:06:28,146
Whatever you do, don't get on that plane.

1481
02:06:35,779 --> 02:06:38,615
Don't worry, Anna.
Arrangements have been made.

1482
02:06:38,782 --> 02:06:41,784
You and your husband will be
over the Canadian border by morning.

1483
02:06:41,952 --> 02:06:43,703
Thank you very much, sir.
- Be careful.

1484
02:06:43,871 --> 02:06:46,456
We will, sir, and God bless you.

1485
02:07:00,137 --> 02:07:02,221
Thank you for everything.
Be careful, now.

1486
02:07:02,389 --> 02:07:05,058
Now, you're not gonna
leave the house until we're...

1487
02:07:05,225 --> 02:07:08,311
I'll wait, sir. I certainly will. Safe journey.

1488
02:07:09,813 --> 02:07:11,522
Thank you very much.

1489
02:07:13,692 --> 02:07:15,068
Bye.

1490
02:07:51,438 --> 02:07:52,772
Stay where you are.

1491
02:08:04,368 --> 02:08:05,868
Sit down.

1492
02:08:10,249 --> 02:08:13,626
As soon as the plane leaves,
my husband and Mr. Leonard will be back.

1493
02:08:41,655 --> 02:08:43,322
What is it?

1494
02:08:44,324 --> 02:08:45,992
I was wondering about my earrings.

1495
02:08:46,160 --> 02:08:47,952
They'll turn up.

1496
02:08:52,040 --> 02:08:54,917
When you return to New York,
say goodbye to my sister for me.

1497
02:08:55,085 --> 02:08:57,754
And thank her for her superb performance
as Mrs. Townsend.

1498
02:08:57,921 --> 02:09:00,423
I'll do that.
Tell your knife-throwing chum...

1499
02:09:00,591 --> 02:09:01,841
...that I've reassured his wife.

1500
02:09:02,009 --> 02:09:04,010
All right.
- That's about all, Leonard.

1501
02:09:20,068 --> 02:09:22,236
Get that figure back from her.

1502
02:09:28,494 --> 02:09:30,203
The housekeeper had me pinned down...

1503
02:09:30,370 --> 02:09:33,039
...before I realized
it was that same silly gun of yours.

1504
02:09:33,207 --> 02:09:35,124
- I see you've got the pumpkin.
- Yes.

1505
02:10:14,164 --> 02:10:16,916
This is no good.
We're on top of the monument.

1506
02:10:35,352 --> 02:10:37,144
What do we do?
Climb down.

1507
02:10:37,312 --> 02:10:38,563
We can't.

1508
02:10:38,730 --> 02:10:40,773
Here they come. We have no choice.

1509
02:11:30,282 --> 02:11:32,241
Well, if we ever get out of this alive...

1510
02:11:32,409 --> 02:11:34,744
...let's go back to New York
on the train together.

1511
02:11:34,912 --> 02:11:36,329
All right?

1512
02:11:36,496 --> 02:11:38,414
Is that a proposition?

1513
02:11:39,499 --> 02:11:41,334
It's a proposal, sweetie.

1514
02:11:42,502 --> 02:11:45,212
What happened
to the first two marriages?

1515
02:11:45,839 --> 02:11:47,840
My wives divorced me.

1516
02:11:48,008 --> 02:11:51,052
- Why?
- Well, I think they said I led too dull a life.

1517
02:11:51,219 --> 02:11:53,638
- Ha, ha.
- Come on.

1518
02:12:04,024 --> 02:12:05,858
You all right?

1519
02:12:08,362 --> 02:12:10,613
All right, all right.

1520
02:12:15,369 --> 02:12:17,244
Okay. Come on.

1521
02:12:17,412 --> 02:12:19,872
Come on. Come up here.

1522
02:12:20,540 --> 02:12:23,334
Come on. Come on. Come on.

1523
02:15:07,374 --> 02:15:10,334
Help. Help me.

1524
02:15:41,575 --> 02:15:42,658
Thank you, sergeant.

1525
02:15:42,826 --> 02:15:45,870
That wasn't very sporting,
using real bullets?

1526
02:15:46,037 --> 02:15:47,705
Here, reach. Now.

1527
02:15:48,748 --> 02:15:51,083
- I'm trying.
- Come on, I've got you.

1528
02:15:51,251 --> 02:15:53,669
- Up.
- I can't make it.

1529
02:15:53,837 --> 02:15:55,546
Yes, you can. Come on.

1530
02:15:55,714 --> 02:15:58,716
- Pull harder.
- Come along, Mrs. Thornhill.

1531
02:16:02,929 --> 02:16:07,433
- Oh. Roger, this is silly.
- I know, but I'm sentimental.
