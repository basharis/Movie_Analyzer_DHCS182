1
00:01:42,953 --> 00:01:45,623
Here it is, trying to buy
the pot. Here he goes.

2
00:01:45,655 --> 00:01:46,757
Buying the pot.

3
00:01:46,791 --> 00:01:49,459
-He doesn't have enough to buy it.
-Buying the pot.

4
00:01:49,492 --> 00:01:51,762
What do you got?

5
00:01:51,795 --> 00:01:54,565
Let's see 'em.

6
00:01:54,598 --> 00:01:57,301
-That's lucky.
-No he has.

7
00:01:57,302 --> 00:01:58,902
That's a flush.

8
00:01:58,934 --> 00:02:00,702
-He had a flush...
-You're lucky.

9
00:02:00,735 --> 00:02:02,238
-It's called being The Champ.
-That's what it's called.

10
00:02:02,271 --> 00:02:07,342
I'll give you "The Champ". Take your
God damned money there, fuckin' punk.

11
00:02:07,375 --> 00:02:11,312
Thank you very much! Fuck yeah.

12
00:02:11,347 --> 00:02:15,584
Fuckin' stripper girls on me
tonight, boys.

13
00:02:15,617 --> 00:02:16,853
It's gettin' cold, boys.

14
00:02:16,884 --> 00:02:21,323
I could share some of this with
you gentlemen, if you'd like.

15
00:02:21,355 --> 00:02:24,525
It is the first of November.

16
00:02:24,558 --> 00:02:27,329
Well, look at this.

17
00:02:27,361 --> 00:02:31,733
One month from today, I'll be sippin'
margaritas with the lady in Florida.

18
00:02:31,764 --> 00:02:36,436
-Florida?
-Every year, baby. Christmas in Florida.

19
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:39,607
Margaritas?

20
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:42,241
Is that, Disney World or
Disney Land in Florida?

21
00:02:42,242 --> 00:02:43,543
What was that, excuse me?

22
00:02:43,577 --> 00:02:46,280
Is it Disney World or
Disney Land in Florida?

23
00:02:46,312 --> 00:02:48,381
PPAh, fuck Disney World.

24
00:02:48,414 --> 00:02:50,984
I'm there for the women, dude.
I'm a grown man.

25
00:02:51,018 --> 00:02:52,852
The women and your girl?

26
00:02:52,885 --> 00:02:54,753
Well...

27
00:02:54,787 --> 00:02:59,659
That's what this money will
help me get, right?

28
00:02:59,691 --> 00:03:00,759
Well

29
00:03:00,792 --> 00:03:03,395
I like a white winter.

30
00:03:04,564 --> 00:03:06,631
So what's the deal, you staying
here again this year?

31
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:08,467
Yeah. Fuck.

32
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,401
I love it up here, you know.

33
00:03:09,435 --> 00:03:12,004
You poor son of a bitch.

34
00:03:12,037 --> 00:03:13,439
Stupid.

35
00:03:13,471 --> 00:03:16,674
-Alright.
-I like the double pay, man.

36
00:03:16,708 --> 00:03:19,478
I'll need it after this poker
game.

37
00:03:19,511 --> 00:03:21,313
Double pay, right...

38
00:03:21,345 --> 00:03:23,448
I wanna see this. C'mon, give
me something good here.

39
00:03:23,482 --> 00:03:24,817
Let's see what we got here.

40
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:27,820
Here we go. Game on, bud.

41
00:03:49,307 --> 00:03:50,475
<i>Jensen!</i>

42
00:03:50,506 --> 00:03:53,909
<i>-Jensen, come in!
-Fuck me!</i>

43
00:03:53,943 --> 00:03:58,315
<i>Chopper's comin' in.
We got company.</i>

44
00:03:58,347 --> 00:04:01,517
<i>Outpost NTC-291,
this is DBA Transport.</i>

45
00:04:01,551 --> 00:04:07,290
<i>Stand by for landing...</i>

46
00:05:19,923 --> 00:05:24,096
Check. Check.

47
00:05:28,466 --> 00:05:29,735
Fold.

48
00:05:29,767 --> 00:05:31,135
Alright, everyone.
This is Professor Olsen.

49
00:05:31,169 --> 00:05:35,407
Head of archaeology for U of T.
Head of field research for the SAA.

50
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,777
Professor, Francis Månro, project
director. Pleasure to meet you.

51
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:42,813
Likewise. I did a paper
on you in University.

52
00:05:42,845 --> 00:05:48,052
That's Drew McNaughton, he's
our equipment technician.

53
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:49,954
And Robert Michael Giles,
field supervisor.

54
00:05:49,987 --> 00:05:52,689
What he's doing here and not
on site is beyond me.

55
00:05:52,723 --> 00:05:54,191
I'm on my break.

56
00:05:54,225 --> 00:05:57,460
And that's, Dr. Richard Andervs,
site assigned medical supervisor.

57
00:05:57,494 --> 00:05:58,496
-Pleasure to meet ya.
-Likewise.

58
00:05:58,527 --> 00:06:00,429
Let me know if
you need anything,

59
00:06:00,462 --> 00:06:04,167
It would be nice to do something
around here for a change.

60
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:08,737
Let me show you the lab.

61
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:09,806
-You want in here?
-Yeah.

62
00:06:09,838 --> 00:06:14,643
Alrighty.

63
00:06:14,676 --> 00:06:15,810
Do it up.

64
00:06:17,512 --> 00:06:20,516
And this is Steven Welles, he's
here on a corporate internship

65
00:06:20,548 --> 00:06:22,617
with a company in Calgary.

66
00:06:22,651 --> 00:06:24,853
He's been my assistant for the
past few months.

67
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:26,888
-How's it going?
-Well, thank you.

68
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,423
You've got a very
impressive resume.

69
00:06:29,457 --> 00:06:30,859
Thank you.

70
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:32,827
Professor Olsen is here to write a
report to hopefully get us a grant

71
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:34,294
from the SSHRC to get us more
funding and more hands.

72
00:06:34,329 --> 00:06:38,499
Hey, that would be great. I really
look forward to working with you.

73
00:06:38,532 --> 00:06:39,901
Likewise.

74
00:06:39,934 --> 00:06:41,835
So, how was the trip in?

75
00:06:41,869 --> 00:06:43,470
Long.

76
00:06:43,504 --> 00:06:46,040
Yeah, it's a long ride on that chopper.
You're lucky, it's three times as long

77
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:48,175
if you were to ride
up during a storm.

78
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:49,609
Is it usually this cold out?

79
00:06:49,642 --> 00:06:53,046
It's not usually this warm.

80
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,180
-Really?
-Yeah.

81
00:06:54,214 --> 00:06:56,149
So I...

82
00:06:56,181 --> 00:06:58,851
Bet you're wondering why they
sent you up to

83
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:02,522
a Northern Paleo Indian outpost.
Something like that, yeah.

84
00:07:02,554 --> 00:07:04,557
I'm curious what they told you.

85
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:06,659
Unusual Clovis findings.

86
00:07:06,692 --> 00:07:08,094
That's all?

87
00:07:08,126 --> 00:07:09,929
They were pretty
vague with the details.

88
00:07:09,961 --> 00:07:14,666
Yeah, we were pretty stingy
with the details ourselves.

89
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:16,468
It's pretty standard, right?

90
00:07:16,502 --> 00:07:19,472
Yeah, I'd say. Standard Clovis
culture. Yeah.

91
00:07:19,504 --> 00:07:22,975
The past three years we've stationed
here, that's all we've dug up.

92
00:07:23,006 --> 00:07:26,144
11,000 B.C.E. Clovis.

93
00:07:26,177 --> 00:07:30,249
It's pretty interesting stuff.
Nothing too exciting though.

94
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,048
Right.

95
00:07:31,082 --> 00:07:35,954
Two weeks ago,
we found this pot.

96
00:07:35,986 --> 00:07:38,922
11,000 B.C.E. Clovis pottery.

97
00:07:38,955 --> 00:07:40,890
It's interesting, but not
impossible.

98
00:07:40,924 --> 00:07:42,892
Yeah, that's not what's
interesting, though.

99
00:07:42,926 --> 00:07:47,197
We found it under sediment
dated to 14,000 B.P.

100
00:07:47,231 --> 00:07:49,665
14,000 B.P. Clovis pottery.

101
00:07:49,699 --> 00:07:52,069
Nope, not Clovis.

102
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,569
Pre-Clovis pottery?

103
00:07:53,603 --> 00:07:56,272
Mesoamerican.

104
00:07:56,305 --> 00:07:58,174
I mean, it looks Mesoamerican.

105
00:07:58,208 --> 00:08:00,076
It's got similar
symbols and markings.

106
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:04,982
We're over 4,000 miles from the
nearest Mesoamerican site.

107
00:08:05,013 --> 00:08:08,150
There's one hundred different
reasons for this being here.

108
00:08:08,184 --> 00:08:10,953
Early trade activity in this
area,

109
00:08:10,986 --> 00:08:14,090
ceremonial burial of a more recent
culture. Something like that.

110
00:08:14,123 --> 00:08:17,158
Right, but 14,000 B.P.?

111
00:08:17,191 --> 00:08:20,862
Well, you know that radio-carbon
dating's not always accurate.

112
00:08:20,895 --> 00:08:22,765
Right...

113
00:08:22,796 --> 00:08:26,700
We've also started unearthing a
structure.

114
00:08:26,733 --> 00:08:27,935
A structure?

115
00:08:27,969 --> 00:08:31,906
A week ago, we began unearthing
a large object that we think

116
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:34,542
is the roof of a structure that
goes down...

117
00:08:34,575 --> 00:08:36,844
Well, really far.

118
00:08:36,877 --> 00:08:37,845
How far?

119
00:08:37,877 --> 00:08:39,412
Maybe a meter. Maybe ten meters.
We don't know.

120
00:08:39,446 --> 00:08:43,650
We don't want to jump to any conclusions
here. I mean, it could be nothing.

121
00:08:43,684 --> 00:08:45,819
It could be planted...
We don't know.

122
00:08:45,852 --> 00:08:47,353
Right. But...

123
00:08:47,386 --> 00:08:50,623
If this is the real deal, then we're
looking at one of the biggest finds

124
00:08:50,656 --> 00:08:54,727
in the past century. We are right in
the middle of the ice-free corridor

125
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:59,533
and this could confirm that
theory.

126
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:09,808
Over the past three years we've covered
over two square kilometers of ground.

127
00:09:09,842 --> 00:09:15,582
Going as deep as
12,000 B.P. of sediment.

128
00:09:15,614 --> 00:09:18,284
Have a good night.

129
00:09:18,316 --> 00:09:20,118
Any of them speak English?

130
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:21,585
All of 'em.

131
00:09:21,619 --> 00:09:24,354
They speak Dogrib with one another,
but they're all fluent in English.

132
00:09:24,389 --> 00:09:27,359
Any of them have experience
with Archaeology?

133
00:09:27,392 --> 00:09:28,794
Not one of 'em.

134
00:09:28,825 --> 00:09:31,027
No, they're all from a reserve about
a hundred miles south of here.

135
00:09:31,062 --> 00:09:35,934
We just pay the, band council
and they give us workers.

136
00:09:39,202 --> 00:09:41,271
Usually finish this early?

137
00:09:41,305 --> 00:09:43,174
We don't get much sunlight up
here.

138
00:09:43,206 --> 00:09:46,076
And when the sun isn't
up, it hits fifty below.

139
00:09:46,108 --> 00:09:47,310
Sun goes down real fast.

140
00:09:47,344 --> 00:09:49,813
Yeah, get stuck out here for
long and your blood will freeze.

141
00:09:49,846 --> 00:09:54,183
I wouldn't want to be the poor son of
a bitch to have to experience that.

142
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:58,154
Okay, gentlemen. Thank you
again.

143
00:09:58,186 --> 00:09:59,922
How many hours of sunlight do
you get?

144
00:09:59,955 --> 00:10:01,957
What, this time of year?
I don't no.

145
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:03,326
Like five... Five and a half.

146
00:10:03,358 --> 00:10:07,329
You know, we try to use as we can
but come December and January

147
00:10:07,362 --> 00:10:11,666
we barely get any at all.

148
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:14,969
So, what do you do with the
other nineteen hours?

149
00:10:15,002 --> 00:10:19,342
Drink, mostly.

150
00:10:26,081 --> 00:10:31,319
Welles and Månro sleep there.

151
00:10:31,351 --> 00:10:33,920
That's my office, and

152
00:10:33,953 --> 00:10:36,189
there's the communication cabin.

153
00:10:36,222 --> 00:10:37,724
That's where Jensen is.

154
00:10:37,758 --> 00:10:42,129
And McNaughton and Giles, they have
their own cabins; They're over there.

155
00:10:42,163 --> 00:10:46,700
And, this is us.

156
00:10:46,734 --> 00:10:51,338
Home, sweet home.

157
00:10:59,144 --> 00:11:00,278
That's me.

158
00:11:00,311 --> 00:11:04,082
Ramis, the site chef; He sleeps
in there.

159
00:11:04,116 --> 00:11:06,351
It's pretty small.

160
00:11:06,384 --> 00:11:08,086
Cozy.

161
00:11:08,119 --> 00:11:09,921
It's a shit hole.

162
00:11:09,955 --> 00:11:12,157
You're upstairs, c'mon. I'll
show ya.

163
00:11:20,398 --> 00:11:22,132
And, finally, your room.

164
00:11:22,165 --> 00:11:24,736
Bed's kind of shitty, but it'll
do the trick.

165
00:11:24,768 --> 00:11:27,372
That heater takes about an hour
to start to work, so...

166
00:11:27,405 --> 00:11:30,074
Sometimes you gotta smack it
around a little.

167
00:11:30,108 --> 00:11:31,510
You're gonna need blankets,
pillows...

168
00:11:31,542 --> 00:11:35,179
There's a stack of that stuff in
laundry room; It's the next room over.

169
00:11:35,213 --> 00:11:37,382
By the way, it gets kind of
loud.

170
00:11:37,414 --> 00:11:39,851
-Wonderful.
-Yeah, it sounds shitty, but

171
00:11:39,883 --> 00:11:43,353
there's a little vent there that siphons
hot air from the machines into this room

172
00:11:43,386 --> 00:11:47,790
so it's actually not that shitty.
Believe me, in a couple of days

173
00:11:47,823 --> 00:11:53,764
you're gonna be thankful we
gave you this room.

174
00:11:53,795 --> 00:11:57,466
Enjoy.

175
00:12:18,353 --> 00:12:22,124
Hey, puss.

176
00:12:24,091 --> 00:12:29,331
Gibson, get off the table.

177
00:12:29,363 --> 00:12:30,297
Gibson!

178
00:12:33,401 --> 00:12:34,502
Okay.

179
00:12:34,535 --> 00:12:35,203
Beat it.

180
00:12:35,235 --> 00:12:38,404
-Bye, puss.
-We're out of eggs.

181
00:12:38,437 --> 00:12:42,475
Alright... Anything else?

182
00:12:42,508 --> 00:12:46,781
Yeah, we'll be out of milk soon.

183
00:12:46,814 --> 00:12:51,384
Okay, I'll radio it in tomorrow.

184
00:13:21,378 --> 00:13:24,116
How many more sites like this
are there?

185
00:13:24,149 --> 00:13:28,152
There's a site like this, one
every hundred miles or so.

186
00:13:28,184 --> 00:13:31,521
Two dozen spread across
the whole area.

187
00:13:31,554 --> 00:13:35,058
Any of the other ones have
anything like this?

188
00:13:35,091 --> 00:13:40,530
Not that we've heard of.
We're out of radio range.

189
00:13:40,562 --> 00:13:44,302
I was reviewing some of the
photos last night.

190
00:13:44,334 --> 00:13:46,571
If you look here, these

191
00:13:46,603 --> 00:13:50,306
kind of look like
symbols of a Trecena.

192
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:53,509
It's a Mesoamerican
period of time.

193
00:13:53,542 --> 00:13:56,846
It's similar, but it's faded

194
00:13:56,879 --> 00:13:58,613
so it's hard to tell.

195
00:13:58,648 --> 00:14:01,884
Maybe a simplified version.

196
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:04,354
Now, if you look over here,

197
00:14:04,386 --> 00:14:07,924
that's nothing. It's just an
image. Maybe a hunting ritual?

198
00:14:07,955 --> 00:14:14,162
Something like that.

199
00:14:14,195 --> 00:14:16,598
How far down do
you think it goes?

200
00:14:16,632 --> 00:14:17,733
No clue.

201
00:14:17,767 --> 00:14:21,136
Based on the depth of
the bedrock in the area, I'd say

202
00:14:21,168 --> 00:14:25,573
-three feet.
-Maybe as many as ten feet.

203
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:38,319
Outpost NTC-291 calling
Station-9, over.

204
00:14:45,592 --> 00:14:51,465
Outpost NTC-291, calling
Station-9, over.

205
00:14:51,497 --> 00:14:55,001
<i>This is Station-9, what can we
do for you, 291? Over.</i>

206
00:14:55,033 --> 00:14:57,035
Hey, how ya doin', Station-9?

207
00:14:57,069 --> 00:15:01,908
When's the next supply
drop at this location? Over.

208
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:08,180
<i>Hold on a minute. Let me check
that for you, 291,</i>

209
00:15:08,212 --> 00:15:10,283
<i>Sunday, November 10th.</i>

210
00:15:10,315 --> 00:15:14,954
<i>In three days, 291. Over.</i>

211
00:15:14,985 --> 00:15:17,288
Okay great.

212
00:15:17,322 --> 00:15:19,524
Can you add...

213
00:15:19,556 --> 00:15:22,226
Let's see. Hang on one
second here.

214
00:15:22,259 --> 00:15:28,298
Milk, cigarettes, and eggs to
the list, please? Over.

215
00:15:28,332 --> 00:15:33,404
<i>Sure can do, 291. Eggs,
milk and cigarettes. Over.</i>

216
00:15:33,437 --> 00:15:39,310
Great, thanks a lot.
Over and out.

217
00:15:41,143 --> 00:15:43,647
Hunker down with a
bottle of Whiskey and a

218
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:49,552
box of porn. Yeah, well
it's much deserved, anyway.

219
00:15:49,585 --> 00:15:53,367
-To whiskey and porn.
-To whiskey and porn!

220
00:15:53,403 --> 00:15:55,257
There it is. Cheers for that.

221
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:58,627
You know what,
while on the subject,

222
00:15:58,661 --> 00:16:01,229
how about a toast,

223
00:16:01,262 --> 00:16:03,498
-to the crew...
-Yep.

224
00:16:03,531 --> 00:16:05,534
Who will be remembered...

225
00:16:05,568 --> 00:16:08,236
For the greatest
archaeological find.

226
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:09,303
Yeah.

227
00:16:09,337 --> 00:16:10,505
-Possibly ever.
-Alright.

228
00:16:10,506 --> 00:16:11,673
I like the sound of that.

229
00:16:11,706 --> 00:16:13,051
-Cheers!
-Gentlemen.

230
00:16:13,052 --> 00:16:16,211
Cheers.

231
00:16:16,244 --> 00:16:20,248
And you'll be remembered as the guy
who sat on his ass the whole time

232
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,483
it was happening.

233
00:16:22,515 --> 00:16:24,051
I,

234
00:16:24,084 --> 00:16:27,122
I'm okay with that.

235
00:16:29,255 --> 00:16:31,358
So, what do you think, Doc?

236
00:16:31,392 --> 00:16:33,294
What do I think about what?

237
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:35,495
About that temple out there?

238
00:16:35,528 --> 00:16:36,896
What do I think?

239
00:16:36,931 --> 00:16:40,735
Who gives a damn what I think? I'm
a doctor, not an archaeologist.

240
00:16:43,437 --> 00:16:44,404
It doesn't get old, does it?

241
00:16:44,437 --> 00:16:47,573
No.

242
00:16:47,607 --> 00:16:49,641
Jesus Christ...

243
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,644
Olsen!

244
00:16:51,676 --> 00:16:54,546
What do you think?

245
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,449
About the temple?

246
00:16:56,481 --> 00:16:59,018
-It's probably not a temple.
-Whatever, you know... How,

247
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:00,651
how far do you
think it goes down?

248
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:04,791
Just based on experience...
If I was looking at a

249
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:08,393
similar structure, in the
Amazon, based on

250
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:12,464
shape, size, some of the
defining characteristics

251
00:17:12,497 --> 00:17:16,168
I would put it about...
20,000 B.C.E.,

252
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:20,439
which is, well, not possible.

253
00:17:20,471 --> 00:17:21,506
Well.

254
00:17:21,539 --> 00:17:28,211
-You know what I think?
-Yeah, what do you think?

255
00:17:28,245 --> 00:17:30,281
Aliens.

256
00:17:32,349 --> 00:17:33,550
That's just...

257
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:36,754
Hey, hey. You laugh now, but
wait until we start pulling up

258
00:17:36,785 --> 00:17:39,222
little green bodies.

259
00:17:39,255 --> 00:17:42,760
You're a God damned idiot.

260
00:17:50,365 --> 00:17:52,067
Where's the file on Alpha-226?

261
00:17:52,101 --> 00:17:56,806
Alpha 200 to Alpha 250 is
listed under fifty-nine.

262
00:17:57,774 --> 00:18:00,476
Well this one is labeled one
hundred.

263
00:18:00,508 --> 00:18:04,780
Red files are one hundred, blue
files are two-hundred.

264
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:11,252
Fuck.

265
00:18:11,285 --> 00:18:14,321
This is giving me a headache.

266
00:18:14,356 --> 00:18:18,661
Why don't you
just call it a day?

267
00:18:18,693 --> 00:18:23,665
Yeah, maybe I will.

268
00:18:37,344 --> 00:18:40,081
<i>Come in, Jensen. Over.</i>

269
00:18:44,783 --> 00:18:47,720
What's up, Giles?

270
00:18:47,753 --> 00:18:50,388
<i>Can you come down to the site?</i>

271
00:18:50,423 --> 00:18:53,227
<i>I think you better see this.</i>

272
00:18:53,259 --> 00:18:55,728
Yeah, I'll, be right down.

273
00:18:55,761 --> 00:18:56,463
Over.

274
00:19:03,536 --> 00:19:05,605
What the hell?

275
00:19:05,637 --> 00:19:06,738
What is that?

276
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:08,575
It's Ramis' cat.

277
00:19:10,408 --> 00:19:13,712
Jesus Christ, who did this?

278
00:19:13,744 --> 00:19:16,680
I don't no.

279
00:19:16,713 --> 00:19:18,215
One of the workers?

280
00:19:18,249 --> 00:19:21,685
Why would they do it?

281
00:19:21,719 --> 00:19:25,390
This is fucked up.

282
00:19:32,461 --> 00:19:34,498
McNaughton?

283
00:19:34,531 --> 00:19:35,765
Yes.

284
00:19:35,798 --> 00:19:37,600
Why would McNaughton
kill the cat?

285
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:41,372
I don't know.

286
00:19:41,403 --> 00:19:45,674
-You saw this happen?
-Yeah.

287
00:19:48,744 --> 00:19:49,846
Okay.

288
00:19:49,879 --> 00:19:51,915
Okay.

289
00:19:51,948 --> 00:19:56,319
I'll look into it.
You can go back to work.

290
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:06,428
This makes no sense.

291
00:20:09,898 --> 00:20:14,336
Hey McNaughton, come in.

292
00:20:14,369 --> 00:20:16,305
Yeah?

293
00:20:16,337 --> 00:20:20,408
Did you kill Ramis' cat?

294
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,409
No.

295
00:20:21,441 --> 00:20:23,544
Well then, who did?

296
00:20:23,577 --> 00:20:26,580
I don't no.

297
00:20:26,613 --> 00:20:31,552
Navaron just came into my office,
he said he saw you doin' it.

298
00:20:31,584 --> 00:20:32,886
He saw me do it?

299
00:20:32,919 --> 00:20:37,291
That's what he says.

300
00:20:38,925 --> 00:20:40,594
Nope, I didn't do it.

301
00:20:40,628 --> 00:20:44,464
You'll figure it out.
I believe in you, buddy.

302
00:20:44,496 --> 00:20:47,466
Copy.

303
00:20:47,499 --> 00:20:48,201
Okay...

304
00:20:58,511 --> 00:21:03,549
Would someone please tell me
what the fuck is going on?

305
00:21:03,581 --> 00:21:09,854
Just get up here, McNaughton, I'll tell
you everything when you get here, okay?

306
00:21:10,956 --> 00:21:16,594
Hey Doc, wake up. I need you
out here right now.

307
00:21:16,627 --> 00:21:19,731
What the fuck is going on?

308
00:21:19,763 --> 00:21:21,531
Jesus Christ.

309
00:21:21,564 --> 00:21:22,799
What's going on?

310
00:21:22,832 --> 00:21:25,402
Three of our guys are gone. The
other two went lookin' for 'em.

311
00:21:25,435 --> 00:21:27,738
Three of the workers? Yeah.

312
00:21:27,772 --> 00:21:32,608
Giles still here? Yeah.

313
00:21:32,642 --> 00:21:33,809
What do you mean, gone?

314
00:21:33,842 --> 00:21:35,911
I mean they're gone, what the
fuck do you think I mean?

315
00:21:35,944 --> 00:21:38,448
Well, why, man? I have
no idea why! Guys, guys!

316
00:21:38,481 --> 00:21:40,850
The workers are all gone.

317
00:21:40,884 --> 00:21:42,653
-Fuck.
-Yeah.

318
00:21:42,685 --> 00:21:45,289
-All but two.
-What about Giles?

319
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,222
Not Giles.

320
00:21:46,257 --> 00:21:51,294
-You didn't hear 'em leave?
-No, I didn't.

321
00:21:51,328 --> 00:21:54,931
There's some tracks from the
cabin, going to the reserve.

322
00:21:54,962 --> 00:21:57,700
-There going back to the rez?
-I don't no, I guess so.

323
00:21:57,732 --> 00:22:00,368
What? Walking? Apparently.

324
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:04,539
This is fucking great.

325
00:22:06,841 --> 00:22:11,645
Three weeks before wrap, you
think they'll send more guys?

326
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:13,147
I doubt it.

327
00:22:13,181 --> 00:22:16,951
Why would they leave in the middle
of the night when it's fifty below?

328
00:22:16,984 --> 00:22:19,687
Maybe they got spooked.

329
00:22:19,721 --> 00:22:20,756
Spooked?

330
00:22:20,788 --> 00:22:23,892
I don't no. They believe in all
sorts of wacky shit.

331
00:22:23,924 --> 00:22:25,693
Maybe something spooked 'em.

332
00:22:25,727 --> 00:22:28,797
Yeah? Like what?

333
00:22:28,828 --> 00:22:30,597
The cat?

334
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:33,567
Yeah. Maybe the cat.

335
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:35,368
You know, it's possible.

336
00:22:35,402 --> 00:22:38,471
They are a pretty superstitious
people.

337
00:22:38,505 --> 00:22:41,440
So, they see the dead cat,
freak out, and leave?

338
00:22:41,474 --> 00:22:43,608
And then wait until the middle
of the night?

339
00:22:43,643 --> 00:22:47,412
I don't no. Maybe it was the cat in
combination with something else.

340
00:22:47,447 --> 00:22:52,051
You know, an animal sighting or something.
What do you mean, an animal sighting?

341
00:22:52,084 --> 00:22:56,889
Animals have a lot of
significance in Dogrib mythology.

342
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:00,991
They can come in the form of
demons, gods, or whatever.

343
00:23:01,026 --> 00:23:06,733
So these guys see a moose in
the camp and run for the hills?

344
00:23:06,765 --> 00:23:09,935
Well, regardless, we can't
work without more guys.

345
00:23:09,968 --> 00:23:12,070
I'm going to call it in.

346
00:23:21,712 --> 00:23:23,881
Well, I wouldn't say no
to an early winter break.

347
00:23:23,914 --> 00:23:28,085
Five months alone here is
more than enough.

348
00:23:28,118 --> 00:23:30,388
What happened to
"can't say no..."

349
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:32,823
Jesus Christ!

350
00:23:32,855 --> 00:23:34,691
What the hell is wrong with him?

351
00:23:37,427 --> 00:23:39,928
-He's got no fever.
-What did you eat?

352
00:23:39,963 --> 00:23:41,665
I don't no, the same
shit you guys ate.

353
00:23:41,697 --> 00:23:47,437
Alright, let's get to my
office. Let's go look at ya.

354
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:55,144
Jesus Christ.

355
00:24:03,017 --> 00:24:07,922
Come in Station-9. Over.

356
00:24:15,663 --> 00:24:20,135
Station-9, come in. Over.

357
00:24:32,045 --> 00:24:36,584
Station-9, come in. Over.

358
00:24:43,722 --> 00:24:48,895
Station-9, are you there?
Come in, please. Over.

359
00:24:58,769 --> 00:25:00,472
So, what's the word?
We goin' home? Or...

360
00:25:00,506 --> 00:25:03,976
No, I couldn't get
a hold of anyone.

361
00:25:04,009 --> 00:25:05,978
What the hell's all this?

362
00:25:06,009 --> 00:25:08,947
Welles threw up.

363
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,548
Is he okay?

364
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:13,851
I think so.

365
00:25:13,884 --> 00:25:16,721
So what do we do?

366
00:25:16,753 --> 00:25:22,626
Go back to work until we can
get a hold of someone.

367
00:25:37,641 --> 00:25:40,677
Alright. Keep those walkies
tuned to the worker's channel,

368
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:43,514
that's channel 3. And keep an
ear by the two-way.

369
00:25:43,545 --> 00:25:47,784
If anyone calls, we'll be back
before dark, alright?

370
00:25:47,815 --> 00:25:49,619
Yeah, yeah. If it's Station-9,
tell them to send an E-Vac.

371
00:25:49,651 --> 00:25:51,120
Yeah, yeah. Look, I know
it sounds trivial, but

372
00:25:51,152 --> 00:25:52,688
it's important. I don't
care if you have to

373
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:57,593
take those radios with you when you take
a shit. Just stay by them, alright?

374
00:25:57,625 --> 00:26:00,528
Okay.

375
00:26:25,719 --> 00:26:27,755
Still feel like shit?

376
00:26:27,787 --> 00:26:29,756
Yeah.

377
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:33,093
And you've been feeling progressively
worse throughout the week?

378
00:26:33,126 --> 00:26:36,162
Yeah.

379
00:26:36,196 --> 00:26:38,599
Any conditions? Anything?

380
00:26:38,631 --> 00:26:42,634
Not that I know about.

381
00:26:42,667 --> 00:26:46,805
Alright. How've
you been sleeping?

382
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:47,274
I'm not.

383
00:26:52,911 --> 00:26:55,147
Open your mouth.

384
00:27:01,386 --> 00:27:04,089
Okay.

385
00:27:04,121 --> 00:27:06,090
My best bet is

386
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:08,660
you got a real bad flu.

387
00:27:08,693 --> 00:27:10,027
How'd I get it?

388
00:27:10,061 --> 00:27:14,265
Well, sometimes, someone has a
virus, but they have the antibodies

389
00:27:14,298 --> 00:27:17,135
so they don't even realize
they're contagious. Right.

390
00:27:17,167 --> 00:27:18,436
Then, they give it to someone
else

391
00:27:18,469 --> 00:27:21,639
and they don't have the antibodies,
and then they get sick.

392
00:27:21,672 --> 00:27:27,044
I'm going to give you some new pain killers,
and some Triazolam; It'll help you sleep.

393
00:27:27,077 --> 00:27:27,712
Alright?

394
00:27:48,397 --> 00:27:52,266
Think they went home?

395
00:27:53,703 --> 00:27:55,136
Just doesn't make any sense.

396
00:27:55,171 --> 00:27:58,907
I mean, they don't have any of their
stuff. They've got no supplies.

397
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:02,044
They're not gonna make it very
far. Not in this weather.

398
00:28:02,077 --> 00:28:04,413
Fuck, it's cold.

399
00:28:04,444 --> 00:28:05,145
Yeah.

400
00:28:09,916 --> 00:28:12,220
What's wrong?

401
00:28:12,253 --> 00:28:15,722
Has anyone else been up here?

402
00:28:15,757 --> 00:28:16,958
Why?

403
00:28:23,264 --> 00:28:25,066
What? We lost?

404
00:28:29,268 --> 00:28:31,338
We're not.

405
00:28:32,338 --> 00:28:34,740
But these tracks aren't
going to the reservation.

406
00:28:34,774 --> 00:28:37,010
They're going in the
complete opposite direction.

407
00:28:37,043 --> 00:28:40,280
No one's been out here as far
as I can tell.

408
00:28:40,313 --> 00:28:44,818
These tracks are headed north.
Reservation's south.

409
00:28:44,851 --> 00:28:49,890
Well if they're headed north,
they're definitely dead.

410
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:15,946
It's not in bad condition
considering it's 11,000 years old.

411
00:29:15,979 --> 00:29:17,247
Yeah, well nothing comes up
here.

412
00:29:17,282 --> 00:29:20,452
On top of that, it's all untouched;
Buried beneath snow and ice.

413
00:29:20,485 --> 00:29:23,486
The reserve where the workers are
from, they don't come up here ever?

414
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:28,426
No, the town they all took off to is the
northern most town for hundreds of miles.

415
00:29:28,457 --> 00:29:30,360
Really?
Yep.

416
00:29:30,392 --> 00:29:32,862
We're the northern most outpost.

417
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:34,865
291 out of 291.

418
00:29:36,998 --> 00:29:39,201
Stop that.

419
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:46,042
Most northern outpost by about
ninety miles.

420
00:29:46,074 --> 00:29:47,876
So what comes up here, then?

421
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:49,311
Nothing.

422
00:29:49,344 --> 00:29:50,812
So, why are we here?

423
00:29:50,846 --> 00:29:55,284
Same reason 290 is there. And
250...

424
00:29:55,317 --> 00:29:57,452
226, 215...

425
00:29:57,485 --> 00:30:00,089
Some surveyor found some
scribble on a rock

426
00:30:00,121 --> 00:30:02,924
and figured it was important
enough to waste years of

427
00:30:02,956 --> 00:30:04,792
people's time and government
money.

428
00:30:04,826 --> 00:30:07,163
Yeah, nothing comes up
this far north through

429
00:30:07,195 --> 00:30:09,964
these mountains except for
the odd charter plane.

430
00:30:09,997 --> 00:30:14,468
Even those stopped coming up here after
that one went down, fifty miles from here.

431
00:30:14,502 --> 00:30:18,338
Engine failure, from the cold.

432
00:30:18,372 --> 00:30:21,508
So what motivated them to build
a camp here?

433
00:30:21,542 --> 00:30:23,810
Rock pile formations, the usual
stuff.

434
00:30:23,845 --> 00:30:28,048
You can see the initial reports.
Jensen's got 'em in his office...

435
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,550
Stop that!

436
00:30:32,386 --> 00:30:36,388
Same old stupid shit.

437
00:31:04,115 --> 00:31:08,319
-You wanna pass me that can?
-This one? I guess it's

438
00:31:08,352 --> 00:31:12,191
empty. We've got...
Three more cans back in

439
00:31:12,222 --> 00:31:16,961
storage. How long can we go for?
I say we got supplies

440
00:31:16,993 --> 00:31:20,564
for, two weeks. At the most.

441
00:31:20,597 --> 00:31:25,502
Supply drop was supposed to
be three days ago? Yeah.

442
00:31:25,535 --> 00:31:29,406
Fuck.

443
00:31:41,985 --> 00:31:45,622
Okay.

444
00:31:45,654 --> 00:31:50,226
We're on for now.

445
00:32:07,208 --> 00:32:11,980
Just put it down there.

446
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:13,114
Is it on?

447
00:32:13,148 --> 00:32:14,582
Yeah, okay? I told you,
this thing works fine.

448
00:32:14,614 --> 00:32:17,150
I just wanna see.

449
00:32:17,184 --> 00:32:19,187
Test, test.

450
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:27,994
Turn the dial.

451
00:32:28,027 --> 00:32:32,331
The dial?

452
00:32:32,364 --> 00:32:35,434
Test, test.

453
00:32:40,572 --> 00:32:43,643
Try ninety-eight.

454
00:32:47,346 --> 00:32:50,117
Test, test.

455
00:32:50,148 --> 00:32:52,051
See, it works.

456
00:32:53,718 --> 00:32:56,487
They must have theirs turned
off.

457
00:32:56,522 --> 00:32:58,089
Or they aren't there.

458
00:32:58,122 --> 00:33:03,295
Maybe there's a storm on the
other side. Who knows?

459
00:33:03,328 --> 00:33:06,499
Well, just rig a loop to
ninety-eight.

460
00:33:06,531 --> 00:33:08,399
Okay?

461
00:33:30,721 --> 00:33:36,160
Yeah, there are, stone piles like this,
one every couple of miles or so.

462
00:33:36,193 --> 00:33:39,295
They're all about a mile from
my initial dig spot,

463
00:33:39,327 --> 00:33:43,233
where we found most of the
Clovis points.

464
00:33:43,665 --> 00:33:46,135
This means the Dogrib
knew about the temple?

465
00:33:46,167 --> 00:33:48,236
Nope. That's likely
just a coincidence.

466
00:33:48,269 --> 00:33:51,974
Stone piles like these are really
common among native cultures.

467
00:33:52,007 --> 00:33:55,677
They're used to mark important
spots like,

468
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:59,015
ceremonial burial grounds
or recurring settlements.

469
00:33:59,047 --> 00:34:02,384
Our theory is, that these were
used to mark a

470
00:34:02,416 --> 00:34:04,752
hunting spot, for,

471
00:34:04,786 --> 00:34:06,988
deer, or maybe bear.

472
00:34:07,021 --> 00:34:08,022
A lot of bear in this area?

473
00:34:08,057 --> 00:34:09,457
Yeah, but you don't have to
worry about that.

474
00:34:09,489 --> 00:34:11,592
This place is covered in bear
traps,

475
00:34:11,626 --> 00:34:13,695
and those will really fuck you
up.

476
00:34:13,728 --> 00:34:15,297
Bear traps?

477
00:34:15,328 --> 00:34:21,234
Yeah, put down in the thirties
by the Dogrib.

478
00:34:22,402 --> 00:34:24,705
These stones were put down
maybe, five,

479
00:34:24,738 --> 00:34:26,707
six hundred years ago.

480
00:34:26,739 --> 00:34:28,441
You see, the natives, they kept
a close eye on this spot

481
00:34:28,475 --> 00:34:32,078
for a few thousand years,
along with some other

482
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:36,081
spots, that we haven't
started to excavate yet.

483
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:38,318
No markings... Nothing?

484
00:34:38,352 --> 00:34:42,122
Just boring old stones.

485
00:34:42,155 --> 00:34:46,324
Your specialty's Clovis.

486
00:34:46,358 --> 00:34:50,462
Yeah, since grad school.

487
00:34:50,495 --> 00:34:54,699
Graduation year? '02.

488
00:34:54,733 --> 00:34:59,037
You ever seen
anything like this?

489
00:34:59,071 --> 00:35:03,342
I've never even heard
about anything like this.

490
00:35:03,375 --> 00:35:04,075
Yeah.

491
00:35:07,745 --> 00:35:10,347
You don't think we're,
we're trying to pull some sort

492
00:35:10,381 --> 00:35:12,683
of elaborate hoax, do you?

493
00:35:12,716 --> 00:35:14,117
Nah.

494
00:35:14,151 --> 00:35:16,620
The radio-carbon dating
you had done on the

495
00:35:16,653 --> 00:35:19,623
structure places it near
the end of the ice age.

496
00:35:19,657 --> 00:35:20,591
Yep.

497
00:35:20,624 --> 00:35:22,359
And it's a solid structure?

498
00:35:22,392 --> 00:35:23,460
Right.

499
00:35:23,494 --> 00:35:26,197
People didn't stay in one place
during the ice age.

500
00:35:26,228 --> 00:35:28,464
Carbon dating of the artifacts
suggests that

501
00:35:28,499 --> 00:35:31,601
these people were here for a
span of a few hundred years.

502
00:35:31,634 --> 00:35:33,402
That's what doesn't make sense.

503
00:35:33,435 --> 00:35:36,705
Maybe they found ways to adapt
to the cold.

504
00:35:36,739 --> 00:35:38,108
Then why did they leave?

505
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:39,209
Where did they go?

506
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:42,210
South, to form early
Mesoamerica.

507
00:35:42,243 --> 00:35:47,451
If they were going south, they
would have gone south.

508
00:36:19,379 --> 00:36:24,151
For Christ sakes, would you cut
it out?

509
00:36:24,183 --> 00:36:25,319
I'm bored.

510
00:36:25,352 --> 00:36:28,754
Go to work. You're still on the
clock.

511
00:36:28,787 --> 00:36:30,723
What clock? There's nothing to
do.

512
00:36:30,756 --> 00:36:32,825
Why don't you try fixing that
radio?

513
00:36:32,858 --> 00:36:35,628
You are the equipment
technician, aren't you?

514
00:36:35,661 --> 00:36:39,499
That fucking radio is fine.
Everything on it works.

515
00:36:39,532 --> 00:36:41,901
Except the part that lets us
talk to other people.

516
00:36:41,934 --> 00:36:44,604
It's the ranger's station's
radio that's fucked, alright?

517
00:36:44,637 --> 00:36:46,405
Nothing I can do here can fix
that.

518
00:36:46,438 --> 00:36:48,307
Well if you aren't going to go
to work,

519
00:36:48,339 --> 00:36:53,847
knock it off with that God
damned ball!

520
00:37:19,604 --> 00:37:21,905
We're out of cream.
That's fine.

521
00:37:21,938 --> 00:37:23,940
Look at this.

522
00:37:23,974 --> 00:37:25,342
You see here?

523
00:37:25,375 --> 00:37:30,179
That looks like a simplified version
of something you'd see on a.

524
00:37:30,213 --> 00:37:32,247
Mayan or Aztec wall.

525
00:37:32,281 --> 00:37:33,750
Really simplified.

526
00:37:33,784 --> 00:37:35,186
Right.

527
00:37:35,218 --> 00:37:36,920
What's strange is that, all of
these symbols

528
00:37:36,953 --> 00:37:41,524
mean nothing in any Mesoamerican
system of writing.

529
00:37:41,556 --> 00:37:46,260
Aesthetically, they look Mesoamerican,
but there's nothing here to suggest

530
00:37:46,294 --> 00:37:48,297
that that is what this is.

531
00:37:48,329 --> 00:37:50,666
I think that the similar
aestheric is

532
00:37:50,699 --> 00:37:52,669
likely just coincidence.

533
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,336
So, what does it stem from?

534
00:37:54,370 --> 00:37:56,505
Well, it doesn't look like
anything from South America,

535
00:37:56,537 --> 00:37:58,306
so it's out of my expertise.

536
00:37:58,341 --> 00:38:02,544
I do believe, however, that
what we're looking at is not a

537
00:38:02,577 --> 00:38:06,582
writing system, but a
systematic series of drawings.

538
00:38:06,614 --> 00:38:10,518
A lot of them are animals.
Maybe a hunting ritual?

539
00:38:10,552 --> 00:38:13,987
Cave wall kind of stuff, but just
with more of a coherent style.

540
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:17,225
So, maybe a culture that was
here before the ice age.

541
00:38:17,257 --> 00:38:19,960
They built the structure
to survive in the cold,

542
00:38:19,992 --> 00:38:23,230
but they didn't make it
to the end of the ice age

543
00:38:23,263 --> 00:38:28,734
because of the cold.

544
00:39:40,603 --> 00:39:43,571
McNaughton, you in there?

545
00:39:44,939 --> 00:39:47,475
McNaughton?

546
00:39:47,508 --> 00:39:52,480
I'm coming in, okay?

547
00:39:57,518 --> 00:39:59,587
Hey.

548
00:39:59,619 --> 00:40:04,458
Why didn't you answer the door?

549
00:40:04,492 --> 00:40:06,528
Sorry...

550
00:40:06,561 --> 00:40:08,363
I was just...

551
00:40:08,396 --> 00:40:10,765
Reading.

552
00:40:10,798 --> 00:40:13,334
Right.

553
00:40:13,367 --> 00:40:20,873
We saved you some lunch. You missed
breakfast, too. Are you okay?

554
00:40:20,906 --> 00:40:22,074
I'm fine.

555
00:40:22,107 --> 00:40:26,979
You... Need me to get you
anything? Something to drink?

556
00:40:27,012 --> 00:40:29,350
I'm fine.

557
00:40:29,381 --> 00:40:32,485
Okay.

558
00:40:32,518 --> 00:40:35,454
Your lunch is in the kitchen.

559
00:40:48,601 --> 00:40:51,969
<i>-Jensen, come in. Jensen.
-Yeah.</i>

560
00:40:52,003 --> 00:40:55,140
<i>Meet me at my office,
I heard screaming.</i>

561
00:40:55,172 --> 00:40:56,365
<i>-I think it's Welles.
-What?</i>

562
00:40:56,366 --> 00:40:57,708
<i>Alright, yeah.
I'll be right there.</i>

563
00:40:57,741 --> 00:41:01,513
<i>What? Alright, yeah.
I'll be right there.</i>

564
00:41:11,622 --> 00:41:13,658
What's going on?

565
00:41:13,689 --> 00:41:14,992
Doc heard screaming.

566
00:41:15,024 --> 00:41:18,561
He went to go check on Welles.

567
00:41:18,595 --> 00:41:20,464
And? Is he alright?

568
00:41:20,497 --> 00:41:24,969
I don't no, it's fucked up.

569
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,772
Help me find it! Just look!

570
00:41:28,804 --> 00:41:29,973
It's okay, Welles, it's okay.

571
00:41:30,005 --> 00:41:33,143
Help me hold him down! What the
fuck are you waiting for?

572
00:41:33,176 --> 00:41:36,545
Jesus! It's right here!

573
00:41:36,578 --> 00:41:39,981
-What the hell!?
-Hold him down!

574
00:41:40,016 --> 00:41:44,721
It's moving up his God damned arm!
What the fuck are you waiting for!?

575
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:46,455
Hold him down! Hold him down!
Shit.

576
00:41:46,488 --> 00:41:47,856
Holy fuck!

577
00:41:47,888 --> 00:41:50,825
-What do you... What do you want me to do?!
-Do something!

578
00:41:50,859 --> 00:41:52,828
-The fuck is that!?
-Cut it off!

579
00:41:52,861 --> 00:41:54,654
-Cut it off!
-Yeah.

580
00:41:54,655 --> 00:41:57,164
The fuck is going on here!?

581
00:41:57,198 --> 00:41:57,681
No! No!

582
00:41:57,682 --> 00:41:59,133
-Hold him down!
-No!

583
00:41:59,166 --> 00:42:01,502
-Giles, hold him down!
-Take it easy, kid.

584
00:42:01,534 --> 00:42:03,504
-Hold him. Hold him!
-Easy kid.

585
00:42:03,536 --> 00:42:05,739
Olsen! Olsen what
the fuck are you...

586
00:42:05,774 --> 00:42:09,143
Clear!

587
00:42:09,176 --> 00:42:13,681
-What the fuck is that, man!?
-Okay, deep breaths.

588
00:42:13,713 --> 00:42:15,583
Deep breaths.

589
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:17,716
-Hold on, kid. Hold on.
-What are you doing?

590
00:42:17,749 --> 00:42:21,555
-Get the fucking morphine.
-Deep breaths.

591
00:42:21,587 --> 00:42:24,223
Hang on kid. Almost there.

592
00:42:24,257 --> 00:42:26,125
Almost there.

593
00:42:26,158 --> 00:42:30,763
Almost there. Almost there.

594
00:42:33,699 --> 00:42:38,538
Fuck!

595
00:42:42,874 --> 00:42:43,576
Fuck.

596
00:43:53,874 --> 00:43:56,812
Anyone ever been sick like this
before?

597
00:43:56,843 --> 00:43:59,713
Yeah, all the time. I'm serious.

598
00:43:59,747 --> 00:44:01,181
You puttin' this in your report?

599
00:44:01,215 --> 00:44:03,017
I'm putting everything in the
report.

600
00:44:03,050 --> 00:44:04,919
Woah. This has nothing to do
with the site.

601
00:44:04,952 --> 00:44:08,555
The report's not just about the
site. It's about the entire camp.

602
00:44:08,590 --> 00:44:10,091
Look. Professor.

603
00:44:10,123 --> 00:44:11,958
We brought you up here to check on
that structure, and get us more money.

604
00:44:11,992 --> 00:44:14,094
You want more money, you have
to address the issues.

605
00:44:14,127 --> 00:44:16,063
Issues? What issues? The guy's sick. It
has nothing to do with the operation.

606
00:44:16,096 --> 00:44:18,964
You weren't properly equipped
to deal with the situation.

607
00:44:18,998 --> 00:44:20,833
That's bull shit.

608
00:44:20,866 --> 00:44:22,869
We cauterized his arm with a
fucking shovel.

609
00:44:22,902 --> 00:44:25,572
Yeah, well we weren't exactly
anticipating a God damned amputation.

610
00:44:25,605 --> 00:44:27,206
You're ill-equipped.
You know what, fine.

611
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:32,812
Do your report. Maybe we can use the grant
money to buy a fucking Cat-Scan machine.

612
00:45:08,111 --> 00:45:13,584
Francis...

613
00:45:30,266 --> 00:45:33,769
Do you see it?

614
00:47:18,401 --> 00:47:21,739
Woah. Jesus fucking Christ.

615
00:47:21,770 --> 00:47:23,872
What... Jesus Christ.

616
00:47:23,907 --> 00:47:25,273
McNaughton...

617
00:47:28,143 --> 00:47:30,946
Anyone, come in, come in,
anyone!

618
00:47:30,981 --> 00:47:32,849
-Is anyone there?
-Is anyone there?

619
00:47:32,883 --> 00:47:33,916
-Is anyone there?
-Is anyone there?

620
00:47:33,949 --> 00:47:36,152
-McNaughton's lost it!
-McNaughton's lost it!

621
00:47:36,185 --> 00:47:40,790
Come in, we're in the lodging cabin,
he cut off his fucking hand, get Doc!

622
00:47:40,822 --> 00:47:42,891
He cut off his fucking hand,
get Doc!

623
00:47:42,923 --> 00:47:47,062
I'm on my way, over. Okay, bud. Just
calm down. What's up? What's happening?

624
00:47:47,095 --> 00:47:51,366
It's going to be okay, Doc's on his
way, okay? Just relax, McNaughton.

625
00:47:51,399 --> 00:47:55,804
Dude,
what the fuck is...

626
00:47:55,835 --> 00:47:59,906
Grab him! Hold him down. Holy
shit!

627
00:47:59,941 --> 00:48:02,444
Hold him down! What happened?
He cut his arm off!

628
00:48:02,477 --> 00:48:04,278
What's wrong with him?!

629
00:48:04,311 --> 00:48:06,847
Help me hold him still.

630
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:08,883
Hold him still.

631
00:48:10,983 --> 00:48:12,819
Tie it up!

632
00:48:12,853 --> 00:48:17,525
Hurry!

633
00:48:17,558 --> 00:48:21,295
C'mon, hold on, McNaughton.

634
00:48:31,571 --> 00:48:37,142
It's probably safe to assume you've
never heard of anything like this.

635
00:48:40,445 --> 00:48:41,947
Is he gonna make it?

636
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:44,983
I don't want to sound
pessimistic, but I doubt it.

637
00:48:45,016 --> 00:48:48,220
Not as long as he stays here.

638
00:48:48,254 --> 00:48:49,321
And McNaughton?

639
00:48:49,352 --> 00:48:53,291
I've got him on an
anti-psychotic.

640
00:48:53,323 --> 00:48:54,859
Did it work?

641
00:48:54,892 --> 00:48:58,864
We'll see. I'll keep a close eye on him
until we can get him out of here, but...

642
00:48:58,895 --> 00:49:00,965
He's probably going to lose the
rest of that arm.

643
00:49:00,998 --> 00:49:05,036
He made a real gnarly mess out
of it.

644
00:49:05,069 --> 00:49:05,570
Christ.

645
00:50:14,035 --> 00:50:15,136
Good.

646
00:50:21,707 --> 00:50:22,409
This way.

647
00:50:32,251 --> 00:50:35,622
Follow my voice.

648
00:50:40,191 --> 00:50:43,962
Open your eyes.

649
00:50:47,065 --> 00:50:49,268
Good.

650
00:50:49,301 --> 00:50:53,238
I can see you, Jensen.

651
00:51:13,689 --> 00:51:15,992
Any symptoms? Feeling sick?

652
00:51:16,025 --> 00:51:16,859
Dizziness, headaches?

653
00:51:16,894 --> 00:51:21,365
No, no, I feel fine, I'm
just... Tired.

654
00:51:21,396 --> 00:51:23,433
Have you been sleeping?

655
00:51:23,465 --> 00:51:25,601
Yeah, some. I,

656
00:51:25,634 --> 00:51:29,106
I wake up and then I can't get
back to sleep.

657
00:51:29,137 --> 00:51:31,273
How long's that been going on
for?

658
00:51:31,307 --> 00:51:34,277
A few weeks.

659
00:51:34,309 --> 00:51:37,112
It's probably stress.

660
00:51:37,146 --> 00:51:41,483
You, have any heart palpitations?
Shortness of breath?

661
00:51:41,516 --> 00:51:43,084
No.

662
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:45,387
Just waking up for no reason?

663
00:51:45,419 --> 00:51:49,190
Yeah, pretty much.

664
00:51:49,223 --> 00:51:53,627
I have been... Having this,
dream,

665
00:51:53,659 --> 00:51:54,362
though.

666
00:52:00,501 --> 00:52:01,670
Well,

667
00:52:01,702 --> 00:52:05,473
sometimes when you dream. The
body releases adrenaline.

668
00:52:05,505 --> 00:52:07,141
Wakes you up. Is it a nightmare?

669
00:52:07,175 --> 00:52:12,412
No, it's not a nightmare, I mean, it's not
like I'm afraid, or anything like that.

670
00:52:17,083 --> 00:52:19,185
What's the dream?

671
00:52:24,290 --> 00:52:27,494
I see this... Person.

672
00:52:27,527 --> 00:52:30,362
These people, I guess.

673
00:52:30,394 --> 00:52:34,633
They're like us, but
they're not.

674
00:52:34,666 --> 00:52:38,137
It's very strange...

675
00:52:38,169 --> 00:52:44,443
I just feel like they're
watching me.

676
00:52:44,476 --> 00:52:46,044
I don't know.

677
00:52:46,076 --> 00:52:50,815
Alright, well. I'll get you some sleeping
pills. They'll help reduce REM sleep.

678
00:52:50,848 --> 00:52:55,652
You got any allergies? Heart
condition?

679
00:52:55,686 --> 00:52:56,389
Okay.

680
00:53:02,726 --> 00:53:05,663
All the artifacts were found within
thirty feet of the structure.

681
00:53:05,696 --> 00:53:08,731
They all have animals on
them being portrayed as

682
00:53:08,766 --> 00:53:12,170
god-like creatures. That
much is fairly evident.

683
00:53:12,202 --> 00:53:13,704
Right.

684
00:53:13,736 --> 00:53:15,238
Based on the sheer amount of effort that
went into making all these artifacts,

685
00:53:15,271 --> 00:53:19,342
and the structure, and the consistent
use of animal imagery on all of it,

686
00:53:19,374 --> 00:53:22,778
there's no question that this site
was extremely important to them.

687
00:53:22,812 --> 00:53:24,713
Probably a place of worship.
Right, like a shrine.

688
00:53:24,747 --> 00:53:28,584
Right. Now, one recurring theme in
a lot of these pieces is the deer.

689
00:53:28,616 --> 00:53:30,118
This deer god is very important
to them.

690
00:53:30,153 --> 00:53:37,126
Maybe a creator god, like a Kukulkan in
Mayan, or Ehecatl in Aztec religion.

691
00:53:37,159 --> 00:53:38,594
You alright?

692
00:53:38,626 --> 00:53:39,829
Yeah, just thinking...

693
00:53:39,862 --> 00:53:44,433
Yeah, as for where they went
to... Look here.

694
00:53:44,465 --> 00:53:48,269
A lot of early tribes and civilizations
were wiped out by disease.

695
00:53:48,302 --> 00:53:52,573
Obviously, they had no medicine back
then, and they had no understanding

696
00:53:52,607 --> 00:53:56,177
of the concept of
germs and bacteria.

697
00:53:56,209 --> 00:53:59,580
Now, this piece. This is our
youngest piece by...

698
00:53:59,613 --> 00:54:02,382
about a hundred years, so far.

699
00:54:02,415 --> 00:54:03,849
Now, if you look here,

700
00:54:03,883 --> 00:54:08,221
these resemble people but, what's
strange is that they're disfigured.

701
00:54:08,255 --> 00:54:11,892
In all the other pieces, their portrayal
of people is fairly accurate.

702
00:54:11,925 --> 00:54:14,894
Standing up... Arms, legs,
heads...

703
00:54:14,927 --> 00:54:17,297
But that's not the case in this
piece.

704
00:54:17,329 --> 00:54:20,500
People are missing appendages.
They're slouched over.

705
00:54:20,533 --> 00:54:23,769
I believe this
depicts an illness...

706
00:54:23,801 --> 00:54:24,971
A plague.

707
00:54:25,002 --> 00:54:29,508
As the ice melted, the bacteria
could have been unfrozen.

708
00:54:29,543 --> 00:54:35,248
I mean, the time line of our pieces
ends near the end of the ice age.

709
00:54:35,281 --> 00:54:37,415
It's just a theory.

710
00:54:37,448 --> 00:54:39,783
So it wasn't the cold that
killed them,

711
00:54:39,816 --> 00:54:42,220
it was the cold
protecting them, in a way.

712
00:54:42,254 --> 00:54:43,922
Exactly.

713
00:54:43,954 --> 00:54:44,989
So everyone dies,

714
00:54:45,024 --> 00:54:48,593
then no one comes through
for thousands of years,

715
00:54:48,626 --> 00:54:52,531
letting the thing get buried
beneath sediment and ice.

716
00:54:53,398 --> 00:54:57,802
Interesting. Well, it's interesting,
but it's not what I'm worried about.

717
00:54:57,834 --> 00:55:01,371
What are you worried about?
I'm worried about Welles.

718
00:55:01,405 --> 00:55:06,277
Welles. You think what he has is
what this artifact is showing?

719
00:55:06,310 --> 00:55:09,612
It's happened before.
The Curse of the Pharaohs.

720
00:55:09,645 --> 00:55:12,948
So, we're looking at a bacteria that's
ten to eleven thousand years old.

721
00:55:12,982 --> 00:55:19,523
Yeah, frozen, deep in the ice along with
that structure and these artifacts.

722
00:55:43,777 --> 00:55:47,348
Someone was sneaking around
the outpost last night.

723
00:55:47,382 --> 00:55:48,550
Who?

724
00:55:48,583 --> 00:55:49,918
You tell me.

725
00:55:49,951 --> 00:55:51,253
I don't no, maybe it was an animal.

726
00:55:51,285 --> 00:55:53,621
For Christ sake, that was no
animal.

727
00:55:53,654 --> 00:55:55,823
It was speaking words, I heard
it outside my room!

728
00:55:55,856 --> 00:55:58,859
Look! I'm hearing things, we're
all hearing things. Okay?

729
00:55:58,892 --> 00:55:59,960
But there's no one out there.

730
00:55:59,992 --> 00:56:02,596
We're in the middle of nowhere.
This is just stress.

731
00:56:02,629 --> 00:56:04,265
It's not stress!

732
00:56:04,298 --> 00:56:06,506
There was someone
outside my fucking window,

733
00:56:06,507 --> 00:56:08,467
speaking fucking
words to someone else!

734
00:56:08,501 --> 00:56:10,169
What are you suggesting?
It's one of the crew?

735
00:56:10,204 --> 00:56:12,639
I'm suggesting,
someone in our crew is

736
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:15,575
sneaking around, snatching
up all our supplies

737
00:56:15,607 --> 00:56:18,711
and is going to leave us with
nothing, and then we're fucked!

738
00:56:18,744 --> 00:56:19,846
-That's insane.
-Is it?

739
00:56:19,878 --> 00:56:21,146
-Yes.
-Is it insane?

740
00:56:21,147 --> 00:56:21,781
Yes!

741
00:56:21,813 --> 00:56:23,916
Is McNaughton slicing up his
arm insane?

742
00:56:23,948 --> 00:56:27,619
Is all our workers waking up
one day and deciding to walk

743
00:56:27,654 --> 00:56:30,556
one hundred miles in the arctic
winter insane?

744
00:56:30,590 --> 00:56:33,360
Just look into it!

745
00:57:00,650 --> 00:57:03,586
<i>Look.</i>

746
00:57:03,621 --> 00:57:07,925
<i>As hard as you can.</i>

747
00:57:10,459 --> 00:57:13,296
<i>Don't look at the trees,</i>

748
00:57:13,330 --> 00:57:15,966
<i>or the mountains...</i>

749
00:57:15,999 --> 00:57:17,801
<i>Look past them.</i>

750
00:57:29,478 --> 00:57:29,979
<i>Look.</i>

751
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:58,706
I just found him
here like this...

752
00:58:04,611 --> 00:58:08,915
He must have untied himself
and taken my rifle.

753
00:58:10,816 --> 00:58:14,486
Well, that's just wonderful.

754
00:58:14,521 --> 00:58:17,624
Did he have a family?

755
00:58:17,656 --> 00:58:19,759
Ex-wife and a kid.

756
00:58:19,793 --> 00:58:21,527
Yeah, divorced though.

757
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:23,029
Still...

758
00:58:25,931 --> 00:58:27,433
Do an autopsy.

759
00:58:27,465 --> 00:58:31,371
See if you can find out what
was wrong with him.

760
00:58:39,443 --> 00:58:44,882
Any word on a rescue?

761
00:58:44,916 --> 00:58:47,686
Not yet...

762
00:59:03,933 --> 00:59:06,569
Wash your hands.

763
00:59:06,602 --> 00:59:12,075
I think I'll take a shower.

764
00:59:16,012 --> 00:59:20,649
Are you gonna watch me cut him
open?

765
00:59:20,682 --> 00:59:22,851
No, thanks.

766
00:59:22,884 --> 00:59:23,587
Fuck...

767
00:59:45,738 --> 00:59:49,509
I ran some tests on the tumors
that were forming under his skin.

768
00:59:49,542 --> 00:59:51,746
The cells aren't human.

769
00:59:51,779 --> 00:59:52,848
What are they?

770
00:59:52,879 --> 00:59:58,919
They bare similarity to the
cells of a cephalopod.

771
00:59:58,953 --> 01:00:00,555
An octopus.

772
01:00:00,587 --> 01:00:03,524
There were traces of human cells, but they
were weird in the sense that they were

773
01:00:03,557 --> 01:00:05,691
in the process of changing...

774
01:00:05,725 --> 01:00:06,827
Into what?

775
01:00:06,861 --> 01:00:08,260
Into the octopus like cells...
Or squid or whatever.

776
01:00:08,293 --> 01:00:12,998
You're trying to tell us that Welles
was turning into an octopus...

777
01:00:13,032 --> 01:00:14,968
Well, sort of.

778
01:00:15,001 --> 01:00:16,469
The cell formations that were building
on his muscle tissue, they would...

779
01:00:16,503 --> 01:00:21,240
detach once they reached a certain
size. I ran some blood tests earlier,

780
01:00:21,272 --> 01:00:25,110
and the invader cells were
present in his blood stream.

781
01:00:25,143 --> 01:00:27,614
And more than likely in his
spine, too.

782
01:00:27,645 --> 01:00:29,747
Welles is turning into an
octopus...

783
01:00:29,781 --> 01:00:31,650
More like, thousands of tiny
little ones.

784
01:00:31,684 --> 01:00:34,652
What the fuck does that mean? It means
that he's really God damned sick.

785
01:00:34,685 --> 01:00:37,522
Okay? I can't dumb it down for
you more than that.

786
01:00:37,555 --> 01:00:38,824
Jesus.

787
01:00:38,856 --> 01:00:40,158
Yeah.

788
01:00:40,192 --> 01:00:41,526
It's not possible.

789
01:00:41,559 --> 01:00:42,560
Really?

790
01:00:42,593 --> 01:00:44,828
-Tell me more, professor.
-Guys!

791
01:00:44,863 --> 01:00:46,997
Guys!

792
01:00:47,030 --> 01:00:49,766
What are we gonna do?

793
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:51,870
Well, I've got him on
every antibiotic I have.

794
01:00:51,903 --> 01:00:55,106
Hopefully, it can stop
the invader cells...

795
01:00:55,138 --> 01:00:55,907
Otherwise...

796
01:00:55,938 --> 01:00:58,976
We have to get a fucking
aquarium.

797
01:00:59,009 --> 01:01:02,679
What about McNaughton?

798
01:01:02,712 --> 01:01:06,016
I found the same bacteria in
McNaughton's blood stream and his spine.

799
01:01:06,049 --> 01:01:09,753
Which leads me to believe that
this bacteria, it spreads like

800
01:01:09,786 --> 01:01:13,924
tertiary syphilis. Okay? It starts
in the spine; It moves to the bones,

801
01:01:13,957 --> 01:01:16,726
the muscle tissue, the skin
and then eventually,

802
01:01:16,759 --> 01:01:18,860
as in this case, the brain.

803
01:01:18,894 --> 01:01:21,130
So, the bacteria drove him
insane?

804
01:01:21,162 --> 01:01:23,565
Well, it's a bit of a stretch
to make that kind of diagnosis,

805
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:26,235
based on the fact that I've never
seen anything like this before.

806
01:01:26,267 --> 01:01:30,772
I mean, he could have had a mental
breakdown due to isolation sickness, or

807
01:01:30,805 --> 01:01:34,576
a schizophrenic episode brought
on by stress, or the bacteria.

808
01:01:34,610 --> 01:01:38,881
I mean, he was exhibiting signs of
schizophrenia. Sudden temper, depression...

809
01:01:38,914 --> 01:01:44,585
But I'd have to see his family's medical
history, and I can't access that from here.

810
01:01:44,618 --> 01:01:45,986
All right, so what do we do?

811
01:01:46,020 --> 01:01:49,090
We need to get Welles to a
hospital or he will die.

812
01:01:49,123 --> 01:01:51,225
I can keep him pumped up with,
antibiotics.

813
01:01:51,259 --> 01:01:57,731
But, hopefully he can fight off
the side effects.

814
01:01:57,764 --> 01:02:00,568
Is it... Contagious?

815
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:01,736
Probably.

816
01:02:01,769 --> 01:02:04,604
First thing tomorrow, I want
that structure re-buried,

817
01:02:04,637 --> 01:02:08,175
I want the artifacts quarantined,
I want the whole site sterilized.

818
01:02:08,207 --> 01:02:09,343
What?

819
01:02:09,376 --> 01:02:11,610
You can't re-open this site
until you've quarantined,

820
01:02:11,644 --> 01:02:14,347
tested, and surveyed all
the wildlife in the area.

821
01:02:14,380 --> 01:02:15,782
That'll take years.

822
01:02:15,815 --> 01:02:18,718
You're already responsible for the
death of one, maybe two crew members.

823
01:02:18,750 --> 01:02:21,286
You started excavating before
the site was deemed safe,

824
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:23,055
and now you're dealing
with the consequences.

825
01:02:23,088 --> 01:02:24,662
-To re-bury the site...
-We are dealing a

826
01:02:24,663 --> 01:02:27,025
dangerous bacteria that
we know nothing about.

827
01:02:27,058 --> 01:02:29,794
What I saw come out of Welles's
arm...

828
01:02:29,829 --> 01:02:31,798
I won't have you, or anyone
else subjected to.

829
01:02:31,831 --> 01:02:33,832
I'm not going to throw away
three years of work! Look, he's

830
01:02:33,865 --> 01:02:36,068
right, okay? This is foreign to
anything I've ever seen before.

831
01:02:36,101 --> 01:02:40,004
We don't know what it can do.
We shouldn't fuck with it.

832
01:02:40,037 --> 01:02:45,977
This is fucking bull shit.

833
01:03:11,135 --> 01:03:14,338
<i>Francis...</i>

834
01:03:19,207 --> 01:03:22,612
<i>Come here...</i>

835
01:04:11,890 --> 01:04:16,027
<i>Did you see it?</i>

836
01:04:16,061 --> 01:04:18,964
I saw you.

837
01:04:18,996 --> 01:04:23,201
<i>What else did you see?</i>

838
01:04:23,235 --> 01:04:27,038
Nothing.

839
01:04:27,072 --> 01:04:29,141
There was nothing there.

840
01:04:29,174 --> 01:04:32,410
<i>They're talking about you.</i>

841
01:04:32,444 --> 01:04:35,280
Who?

842
01:04:35,313 --> 01:04:37,917
<i>The others.</i>

843
01:04:37,949 --> 01:04:39,983
Why?

844
01:04:40,018 --> 01:04:46,191
<i>They think you're going mad.</i>

845
01:04:46,224 --> 01:04:47,392
Am I?

846
01:04:47,425 --> 01:04:51,997
<i>They think you've got it.</i>

847
01:04:54,965 --> 01:04:55,466
Do I?

848
01:05:03,373 --> 01:05:08,278
<i>That's right...</i>

849
01:05:08,311 --> 01:05:12,315
<i>Good.</i>

850
01:05:35,103 --> 01:05:38,405
Hey. You're up late.

851
01:05:41,141 --> 01:05:43,377
First thing tomorrow, we're going
to quarantine these artifacts,

852
01:05:43,411 --> 01:05:48,517
start a report so we can get the ball
rolling on re-opening this site.

853
01:05:50,850 --> 01:05:53,486
Okay.

854
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:55,922
You okay?

855
01:05:55,955 --> 01:05:58,191
Yeah.

856
01:05:58,225 --> 01:06:00,361
I mean, I've seen some
shit before, but...

857
01:06:00,393 --> 01:06:01,895
Nothing like that...

858
01:06:01,928 --> 01:06:05,799
This thing goes sour, I'm the one that
has to explain it to his parents.

859
01:06:13,306 --> 01:06:17,543
<i>Kill him.</i>

860
01:06:18,978 --> 01:06:21,814
If a rescue doesn't come
in the next few days, I

861
01:06:21,846 --> 01:06:24,917
think a few of us should
go hike up to the reserve.

862
01:06:24,950 --> 01:06:28,554
<i>-Do it.
-Sure.</i>

863
01:06:28,587 --> 01:06:30,156
<i>Kill him.</i>

864
01:06:30,187 --> 01:06:34,325
Weather's going to break
in the next few days.

865
01:06:34,359 --> 01:06:39,064
I think it might be smart to
take advantage of that

866
01:06:39,096 --> 01:06:42,999
while we can.

867
01:06:43,033 --> 01:06:43,535
Okay.

868
01:06:48,006 --> 01:06:52,476
You need anything?

869
01:06:52,508 --> 01:06:55,246
No.

870
01:06:55,278 --> 01:06:55,978
You sure?

871
01:07:00,949 --> 01:07:02,519
Yeah.

872
01:07:02,551 --> 01:07:06,823
Alright.

873
01:09:24,020 --> 01:09:27,722
Stop!

874
01:09:28,722 --> 01:09:36,131
I... Just stop!

875
01:09:36,163 --> 01:09:38,031
Why?

876
01:09:38,065 --> 01:09:39,332
He was in pain.

877
01:09:39,367 --> 01:09:41,403
I put him out of his pain.

878
01:09:41,434 --> 01:09:42,670
He was in pain.

879
01:09:42,702 --> 01:09:45,406
His face, I've never
seen anything like it.

880
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:49,176
-It was horrible.
-Just step back.

881
01:09:49,208 --> 01:09:54,714
All the way to the wall.

882
01:09:54,747 --> 01:09:58,685
Step back! Just
stay the fuck back.

883
01:09:58,719 --> 01:10:02,556
What did you do?
What the fuck did you do?

884
01:10:02,588 --> 01:10:04,456
He was in pain. He couldn't die.

885
01:10:04,490 --> 01:10:08,394
He wanted me to kill him. I didn't
want to. But he wanted me to...

886
01:10:08,428 --> 01:10:12,665
He made me do it. He made me do
it. So I cut his wrist,

887
01:10:12,696 --> 01:10:16,102
but he didn't die, so I... I cut
his throat, but he kept screaming

888
01:10:16,134 --> 01:10:18,303
so I thought if I take off his
head, and I kept hitting him...

889
01:10:18,336 --> 01:10:21,539
-Step back! He didn't die, man!
-He didn't die!

890
01:10:21,572 --> 01:10:23,108
-And I didn't know what to do!
-Stop!

891
01:10:23,141 --> 01:10:25,344
I kept trying and I tried to
stop his heart

892
01:10:25,378 --> 01:10:29,447
but it didn't stop. It didn't
stop! And it was horrible!

893
01:10:29,481 --> 01:10:33,151
I didn't know, it was why...
It was so horrible.

894
01:10:33,185 --> 01:10:34,386
It was...

895
01:10:34,419 --> 01:10:37,821
It was... He made me
do it. I swear to God.

896
01:10:37,856 --> 01:10:42,161
I swear to God, he made me...
He...

897
01:10:42,193 --> 01:10:46,329
Jesus...

898
01:10:46,363 --> 01:10:50,435
What the fuck is going on!?

899
01:10:50,467 --> 01:10:52,569
I... I didn't... He...

900
01:10:52,602 --> 01:10:56,605
I want to go home.

901
01:10:56,640 --> 01:11:00,176
I would like to go home.

902
01:11:07,417 --> 01:11:08,652
No, I told you, I want to go...

903
01:11:08,685 --> 01:11:12,856
No, don't, no!

904
01:11:12,888 --> 01:11:13,889
He made me do it.

905
01:11:13,924 --> 01:11:16,791
Don't try anything, or
I'll fucking shoot you.

906
01:11:16,826 --> 01:11:18,827
Please.

907
01:11:18,861 --> 01:11:20,662
I had no choice.

908
01:11:20,697 --> 01:11:24,533
I'm going to be out in the room,
right here, so don't try anything!

909
01:11:24,566 --> 01:11:26,734
We'll let you out when the
rescue comes.

910
01:11:26,767 --> 01:11:30,238
<i>No! Listen to me! I had no
choice!</i>

911
01:11:30,271 --> 01:11:33,709
<i>Giles! He made me do it!</i>

912
01:11:33,741 --> 01:11:35,510
<i>Giles!</i>

913
01:11:35,543 --> 01:11:39,681
<i>Giles! Listen!</i>

914
01:11:39,714 --> 01:11:43,550
<i>Giles!</i>

915
01:11:52,259 --> 01:11:56,262
<i>You did a good thing.</i>

916
01:12:28,327 --> 01:12:31,497
Your blood pressure's good.
Liver checks out,

917
01:12:31,528 --> 01:12:34,632
kidneys are fine... Thyroid,
it's all fine.

918
01:12:35,265 --> 01:12:38,736
<i>Hey Doc, come in.</i>

919
01:12:38,768 --> 01:12:40,004
Go ahead.

920
01:12:40,037 --> 01:12:41,505
<i>Yeah. Look, I'm down at the
supply shed, I just need a hand.</i>

921
01:12:41,539 --> 01:12:47,411
<i>I gotta get a bunch of these boxes
inside. Can you, can you come down?</i>

922
01:12:47,443 --> 01:12:51,381
Copy.

923
01:12:51,415 --> 01:12:53,918
I'll be right back.

924
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:28,417
Who's there?

925
01:13:28,449 --> 01:13:29,952
Hello?

926
01:13:38,994 --> 01:13:42,463
Olsen...

927
01:13:45,832 --> 01:13:46,466
Olsen...

928
01:13:51,037 --> 01:13:54,407
McNaughton?

929
01:13:59,579 --> 01:14:04,483
Onchocerca

930
01:14:04,517 --> 01:14:06,519
volvulus...

931
01:14:06,551 --> 01:14:12,626
It lays it's maggots,
in human skin,

932
01:14:12,658 --> 01:14:15,294
which survive in the eyeball.

933
01:14:15,327 --> 01:14:16,894
Shut up!

934
01:14:16,929 --> 01:14:18,632
It only lays

935
01:14:18,664 --> 01:14:22,334
it's eggs in humans.

936
01:14:22,366 --> 01:14:26,838
Why are you telling me this?

937
01:14:26,871 --> 01:14:31,475
Five million people a year

938
01:14:33,977 --> 01:14:37,948
to propagate it's species...
Shut up!

939
01:14:37,981 --> 01:14:40,517
Such tiny,

940
01:14:40,551 --> 01:14:43,053
insignificant creatures...

941
01:14:59,368 --> 01:15:03,538
It was... Speaking to me... I...

942
01:15:03,573 --> 01:15:06,742
I swear, it was speaking...

943
01:15:06,775 --> 01:15:11,781
It was saying something about maggots,
and it wouldn't stop, and I...

944
01:15:11,813 --> 01:15:15,984
I had to stop it. I...

945
01:15:20,855 --> 01:15:24,793
I stopped it.

946
01:15:24,827 --> 01:15:28,631
When was the last time you
slept?

947
01:15:28,662 --> 01:15:32,567
I'm not sure...

948
01:15:36,470 --> 01:15:40,842
You're hallucinating. No.

949
01:15:40,874 --> 01:15:44,112
Maybe... I...

950
01:15:44,144 --> 01:15:48,115
I don't know. It's... It's...

951
01:15:48,147 --> 01:15:51,785
It seemed real.

952
01:15:51,817 --> 01:15:54,722
I'm going to give you some sleeping
pills so you can get some rest.

953
01:15:54,754 --> 01:15:56,589
Lack of sleep, it triggers
hallucinations.

954
01:15:56,623 --> 01:16:00,727
It seemed so real. I'm going
to give you some Xanax, too.

955
01:16:00,760 --> 01:16:06,431
I want you to take these and
get some sleep.

956
01:16:06,466 --> 01:16:09,435
I'll take care of this...

957
01:16:25,082 --> 01:16:29,654
It seemed real...

958
01:16:51,073 --> 01:16:54,044
I brought you some soup.

959
01:16:59,115 --> 01:17:05,155
We're gonna hike up, to the
reserve tomorrow, if...

960
01:17:06,556 --> 01:17:08,491
What the hell happened to you?

961
01:17:08,523 --> 01:17:10,458
Do you not see him?

962
01:17:12,594 --> 01:17:15,431
There's not much of that left,
so you just make it last.

963
01:17:15,464 --> 01:17:17,432
Please tell me you see him.

964
01:17:17,467 --> 01:17:19,133
You see him, right?

965
01:17:19,168 --> 01:17:22,171
I don't. I don't see anything.
What should I see?

966
01:17:22,204 --> 01:17:24,840
He's here. Now.

967
01:17:24,873 --> 01:17:25,973
Listening.

968
01:17:26,007 --> 01:17:29,977
Watching. He's watching me,
Jensen.

969
01:17:30,010 --> 01:17:33,449
I can't move without him
watching me. I can't move!

970
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:34,715
Just calm down!

971
01:17:34,749 --> 01:17:40,487
-Okay? It's alright.
-I can't do it anymore. He wants me to...

972
01:17:40,521 --> 01:17:42,956
He made me do it.

973
01:17:42,989 --> 01:17:47,862
Okay, just tell me what you see.

974
01:17:47,894 --> 01:17:50,932
He's behind you.

975
01:18:02,908 --> 01:18:05,111
What's he doing?

976
01:18:05,144 --> 01:18:07,181
Watching you.

977
01:18:10,683 --> 01:18:15,456
Touching you.

978
01:18:18,290 --> 01:18:19,925
Watching me.

979
01:18:19,958 --> 01:18:22,227
He's angry with me. He's going
to do something. I don't...

980
01:18:22,260 --> 01:18:23,495
Who is he? A deer.

981
01:18:23,527 --> 01:18:27,030
He's a deer. It's...
I don't know!

982
01:18:27,064 --> 01:18:29,835
Don't leave me.

983
01:18:29,867 --> 01:18:32,537
This is all in your head.

984
01:18:32,570 --> 01:18:35,273
I don't want it anymore.

985
01:18:35,306 --> 01:18:37,402
I'm going to see if Doc
has something for you, okay?

986
01:18:37,403 --> 01:18:39,244
No.

987
01:18:39,276 --> 01:18:43,547
Jensen, please.

988
01:18:43,580 --> 01:18:46,217
Stay. Please. No.

989
01:18:46,249 --> 01:18:48,885
Jensen!

990
01:19:00,129 --> 01:19:03,633
Come back!

991
01:19:03,666 --> 01:19:08,171
Jen, come back!

992
01:19:45,705 --> 01:19:48,041
Where are you going?

993
01:19:48,075 --> 01:19:49,742
I think we should
hike up to the rez.

994
01:19:49,776 --> 01:19:51,912
The weather's gonna be
nice in the next few days.

995
01:19:51,945 --> 01:19:55,049
Yeah, it looks like you already
thought about that.

996
01:19:55,080 --> 01:19:56,950
I was going to tell you guys.

997
01:19:56,982 --> 01:19:58,318
Really?

998
01:19:58,351 --> 01:20:01,054
Because it looks like you were
about to leave us here.

999
01:20:01,087 --> 01:20:02,522
I was not going to leave you
guys.

1000
01:20:02,555 --> 01:20:06,159
What? Were you just going to take
the rest of our food with you, too?

1001
01:20:06,192 --> 01:20:08,360
I'm not ditching you guys.

1002
01:20:08,394 --> 01:20:10,997
Just making sure you got the
map and the flashlights?

1003
01:20:11,030 --> 01:20:12,332
You got the batteries there,
too? Hey!

1004
01:20:12,363 --> 01:20:15,100
There's other maps and
there's other flashlights,

1005
01:20:15,133 --> 01:20:17,234
and I'm not fucking
ditching you guys.

1006
01:20:17,268 --> 01:20:19,637
I know your type, Jensen.

1007
01:20:19,672 --> 01:20:21,074
Fucking sociopaths.

1008
01:20:21,105 --> 01:20:24,710
Acting all respectable and altruistic
until your opportunity pops up,

1009
01:20:24,743 --> 01:20:30,115
to get ahead, and bam, there you are,
pushing the rest of us out of the way!

1010
01:20:30,147 --> 01:20:32,116
Well guess what? What?

1011
01:20:32,148 --> 01:20:34,987
If I see you touching
any of our shit,

1012
01:20:35,019 --> 01:20:36,355
I'm going to shoot you.

1013
01:20:36,386 --> 01:20:37,456
And then I'm going to kill you.

1014
01:20:37,487 --> 01:20:41,157
And I won't hesitate, and I
won't have no sympathy.

1015
01:20:41,190 --> 01:20:43,760
Because people like
you got it coming.

1016
01:20:43,794 --> 01:20:46,330
People like you
have it long coming.

1017
01:20:46,362 --> 01:20:50,968
Don't think I don't
have my eyes on you.

1018
01:21:25,466 --> 01:21:27,770
Scared me.

1019
01:21:27,802 --> 01:21:31,938
When was the last time you
slept?

1020
01:21:31,972 --> 01:21:33,940
I don't no.

1021
01:21:33,975 --> 01:21:36,177
Yesterday?

1022
01:21:36,209 --> 01:21:37,944
The day before?

1023
01:21:37,977 --> 01:21:39,279
Okay, I'm taking over.

1024
01:21:39,312 --> 01:21:39,779
Why?

1025
01:21:39,814 --> 01:21:41,849
So you can sleep.

1026
01:21:41,882 --> 01:21:45,318
No, I'm fine.

1027
01:21:45,351 --> 01:21:46,953
Worry about yourself.

1028
01:21:46,986 --> 01:21:49,422
What, you don't trust me?

1029
01:21:49,457 --> 01:21:50,857
Why should I?

1030
01:21:50,890 --> 01:21:52,026
What did I do?

1031
01:21:52,058 --> 01:21:55,429
What did McNaughton do?

1032
01:21:55,461 --> 01:21:57,096
What'd he do?

1033
01:21:57,131 --> 01:21:59,332
You know it's going to be a long winter if
you're gonna spend it up here by yourself

1034
01:21:59,364 --> 01:22:00,733
not trusting anyone.

1035
01:22:00,766 --> 01:22:04,170
Well, if that's what I have to do,
then that's what I have to do.

1036
01:22:08,005 --> 01:22:12,277
I brought you this.

1037
01:22:12,310 --> 01:22:15,014
I don't want it.

1038
01:22:15,046 --> 01:22:18,017
When was the last time you ate?

1039
01:22:18,049 --> 01:22:21,486
I don't no.

1040
01:22:21,519 --> 01:22:23,421
Eat it.

1041
01:22:23,454 --> 01:22:24,655
No.

1042
01:22:24,689 --> 01:22:27,858
I can make my
own food, thank you.

1043
01:22:27,893 --> 01:22:30,128
It's not poison. Leave me alone.

1044
01:22:30,160 --> 01:22:31,695
Fucking hell, man.
It's freezing cold.

1045
01:22:31,728 --> 01:22:35,499
You're not going to eat, you're not going
to sleep? You're going to die in here.

1046
01:22:35,532 --> 01:22:36,433
Then let me die!

1047
01:22:36,468 --> 01:22:41,773
Worry about your fucking
selves, I'm fine.

1048
01:24:15,060 --> 01:24:16,395
Giles!

1049
01:24:23,267 --> 01:24:26,939
Yeah.

1050
01:24:55,964 --> 01:24:58,233
Fuck!

1051
01:24:58,268 --> 01:25:01,972
Mother fucker!

1052
01:25:37,238 --> 01:25:43,578
Jesus fucking Christ...

1053
01:25:43,610 --> 01:25:45,545
He's dead.

1054
01:25:49,649 --> 01:25:53,987
Doc's dead.

1055
01:25:59,492 --> 01:26:01,261
This is bad.

1056
01:26:01,292 --> 01:26:05,130
It's not that bad. No, you're
losing a lot of blood.

1057
01:26:05,163 --> 01:26:07,700
There's probably some
internal bleeding.

1058
01:26:07,733 --> 01:26:09,468
Fuck. Fuck...

1059
01:26:09,501 --> 01:26:12,104
We need a doctor, I don't
know what I'm doing.

1060
01:26:12,136 --> 01:26:13,471
We've got to get to the reserve.

1061
01:26:13,504 --> 01:26:20,446
You can't go anywhere like this.

1062
01:26:20,477 --> 01:26:22,446
You gotta go.

1063
01:26:22,479 --> 01:26:24,716
I'll stay here.

1064
01:26:24,749 --> 01:26:26,418
You'll die.

1065
01:26:26,451 --> 01:26:29,554
I'll be fine.

1066
01:26:29,586 --> 01:26:33,557
There's a... a trail, behind the
site.

1067
01:26:33,589 --> 01:26:38,195
It goes all the way to the reserve.
It's about... Ninety miles.

1068
01:26:38,228 --> 01:26:44,400
If you, hurry, you can get
there in a day and a half, so...

1069
01:26:44,433 --> 01:26:46,069
Okay.

1070
01:26:46,102 --> 01:26:48,104
Sun's coming up in
an hour and a half.

1071
01:26:48,105 --> 01:26:51,107
You'll be down the
mountain in, I don't know...

1072
01:26:51,140 --> 01:26:52,576
Five. And,

1073
01:26:52,609 --> 01:26:57,512
it's going to be a
lot warmer then, so...

1074
01:26:57,546 --> 01:27:01,184
There's a map... in my room.

1075
01:27:01,216 --> 01:27:03,451
I'll be sure to send help.

1076
01:27:03,485 --> 01:27:04,186
Okay.

1077
01:27:31,813 --> 01:27:34,582
<i>Stop him.</i>

1078
01:27:34,616 --> 01:27:38,052
<i>Stop him.</i>

1079
01:27:38,085 --> 01:27:42,489
<i>Go. Stop him, Jensen.</i>

1080
01:29:14,542 --> 01:29:18,512
Fuck!

1081
01:30:50,565 --> 01:30:52,836
You're not real!

1082
01:30:55,606 --> 01:30:57,941
What do you want from me?

1083
01:30:57,974 --> 01:31:02,311
<i>When an animal looks
up at the night sky,</i>

1084
01:31:02,345 --> 01:31:05,279
<i>what does it see?</i>

1085
01:31:05,314 --> 01:31:10,752
<i>Thousands and thousands
of tiny points.</i>

1086
01:31:10,785 --> 01:31:14,590
<i>Then a man looks up at the same
points</i>

1087
01:31:14,622 --> 01:31:18,726
<i>and sees millions of stars.</i>

1088
01:31:18,759 --> 01:31:21,863
<i>Galaxies, within which</i>

1089
01:31:21,895 --> 01:31:26,433
<i>are billions of planets.</i>

1090
01:31:26,467 --> 01:31:29,536
<i>Do you want to know what I see?</i>

1091
01:31:32,372 --> 01:31:37,544
<i>Were you there,
when I created the stars?</i>

1092
01:31:37,577 --> 01:31:39,512
No.

1093
01:31:39,545 --> 01:31:42,481
<i>Space?</i>

1094
01:31:42,514 --> 01:31:43,983
<i>Time?</i>

1095
01:31:44,017 --> 01:31:44,985
No!

1096
01:31:45,017 --> 01:31:49,655
<i>But still, you think you
deserve understanding.</i>

1097
01:31:49,688 --> 01:31:53,659
I've done nothing to you.
I'm leaving your home.

1098
01:31:53,692 --> 01:31:58,530
<i>You don't really think I'm
bound to that structure,</i>

1099
01:31:58,563 --> 01:31:59,833
<i>do you?</i>

1100
01:32:01,065 --> 01:32:06,437
<i>Artificial carvings on a stone?</i>

1101
01:32:06,471 --> 01:32:11,876
<i>Certainly, you don't believe
that I can be omnipotent,</i>

1102
01:32:11,909 --> 01:32:13,912
<i>omniscient</i>

1103
01:32:13,945 --> 01:32:16,382
<i>but not omnipresent.</i>

1104
01:32:16,414 --> 01:32:17,783
You're not God!

1105
01:32:17,815 --> 01:32:22,452
God isn't cruel. He doesn't
kill men like this!

1106
01:32:22,486 --> 01:32:24,422
<i>-No?
-No!</i>

1107
01:32:24,423 --> 01:32:25,958
<i>Do you believe that?</i>

1108
01:32:25,989 --> 01:32:30,494
If you are God, tell me why!

1109
01:32:30,528 --> 01:32:32,429
Tell me!

1110
01:32:32,462 --> 01:32:34,531
<i>I have to go.</i>

1111
01:32:34,564 --> 01:32:37,768
Why don't you stop me?

1112
01:32:37,800 --> 01:32:41,504
Because you're in my fucking
mind, that's why!

1113
01:32:41,537 --> 01:32:43,940
<i>Why don't you think I'm real?</i>

1114
01:32:43,973 --> 01:32:46,576
Because you're a
fucking parasite!

1115
01:32:46,608 --> 01:32:49,979
<i>I'm not here to teach you,</i>

1116
01:32:50,012 --> 01:32:52,514
<i>or to make you believe in me.</i>

1117
01:32:52,549 --> 01:32:54,718
Then shut the fuck up.

1118
01:33:00,589 --> 01:33:03,559
I don't give a shit
what you want,

1119
01:33:03,592 --> 01:33:04,893
where you came from,

1120
01:33:04,927 --> 01:33:07,995
or what you're fucking doing
here.

1121
01:33:12,634 --> 01:33:15,370
You can go fuck yourself,
asshole.

1122
01:33:22,709 --> 01:33:27,514
Where are you!?

1123
01:33:32,452 --> 01:33:35,894
Tell me, God dammit!
