an ANDREY ZVyAGINTSEV film

00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:35,115
THE RETURN

4
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,869
Sunday

5
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,353
Let's jump, like we said!

6
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,518
Use a ladder and
you're stupid and a chicken.

7
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:45,193
- Go on, Vityok. You're next.
- Why me?

8
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:49,029
- Scared?
- Go on, go on...

9
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,157
- It's scary!
- Don't chicken out!

10
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,749
Don't hurt your armpits!

11
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:13,756
- Andrei, let's use the ladder.
- You want to be called a chicken?

12
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,718
What if something happens?

13
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:19,032
Quiet! You jump after me, got it?

14
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,554
- Did you hurt your armpits?
- No.

15
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,190
Come on, Shorty. Jump!

16
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,754
Hey! What's wrong?

17
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:09,075
If you're scared, climb down.
We're not waiting!

18
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,670
Wait! He's jumping!
He just needs to focus!

19
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,515
Vanya,

20
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,431
jump! Come on!

21
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,917
Andrei, let's go!

22
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,752
It's already late!
Jump or climb down!

23
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,275
To hell with you then!

24
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:09,636
Vanya, my son!

25
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,190
Mum! Mummy!

26
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,553
I told you not to come here!

27
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,516
Oh Lord!

28
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,673
- Get dressed.
- I can't.

29
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,072
- Let's go home!
- I can't.

30
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,999
- Why?
- I have to jump.

31
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,839
- I can't climb down.
- Why?

32
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:45,198
If I climb down,
they'll call me stupid and a chicken.

33
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:49,075
No one will know! Don't worry!

34
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,512
But you'll know

35
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:56,077
I climbed down instead of jumping.

36
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:59,434
Don't be silly, I won't tell anyone.

37
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,398
You can jump another time.

38
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,232
- Really?
- Of course.

39
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,796
Mum, I was sitting here
and I was scared.

40
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,911
If you hadn't come, I'd have died.

41
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,511
Don't be silly, dear!
Really, I'm here with you!

42
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,348
Monday

43
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,157
Hello everyone!

44
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,913
Hello!

45
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,109
We don't talk to chickens.

46
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:47,594
- What? Who's a chicken?
- You! A stupid chicken.

47
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,510
You're a chicken. aren't you?

48
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,039
Go on, Andrei, what is he?

49
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:55,870
A chicken.

50
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,949
- Got it?
- You're a jerk!

51
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,310
- You ripped my shirt, arse!
- You busted my lip, idiot.

52
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,511
Mum'll kill you!

53
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:30,230
Go on, catch me! Go on!

54
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,997
Mum! He ripped my shirt!

55
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,919
He's lying! He busted my lip!

56
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,475
- Hush, both of you.
- Mum...

57
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,551
I said quiet! Dad's sleeping!

58
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,638
Who?

59
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:38,955
Who's sleeping?

60
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,713
Your father.

61
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,479
Go in.

62
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,878
That's definitely him.

63
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,353
Pour them some wine.

64
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,592
Well, hello.

65
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,234
Hello.

66
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,594
Hello, Dad.

67
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,233
Let's drink.

68
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,593
Like it?

69
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,954
Not really.

70
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,712
I liked it.
Can I have some more?

71
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,593
That's enough. Eat.

72
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,232
- Is that your car in the yard?
- Yes.

73
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,193
- Will you give us a ride?
- Of course.

74
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,790
- We're going on a trip.
- Really?

75
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,396
Really. Tomorrow morning.

76
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,592
- Really, Mum?
- Really, son.

77
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:30,237
- Are we going fishing?
- Of course, if you want.

78
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,639
Shorty!

79
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,791
Listen, Shorty!

80
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,114
- What?
- Did you put the sinkers in?

81
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,038
Yes.

82
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,436
Good.

83
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:41,553
- You packed them yourself.
- Right.

84
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:45,755
Did you see how big he is?
Probably works out.

85
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,791
Probably.

86
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:53,714
- Where did he come from?
- He just came.

87
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:58,152
- Aren't you happy?
- Yes, I'm happy.

88
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:01,517
But Mum said he's a pilot.
Doesn't look like one.

89
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,392
Why?

90
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,835
Well, you know how pilots are.

91
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:09,396
Uniforms, their caps...

92
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,472
He's on holiday,
why would he wear a uniform?

93
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,352
Maybe.

94
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,957
Did you pack the camera?

95
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,556
Yes, and a notebook.

96
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,909
What for? Homework?

97
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,277
To keep a diary, stupid!
We'll take turns.

98
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,511
Yes, we can keep a diary!

99
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,110
What's all this talk?
Why aren't you sleeping?

100
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,151
Alright, Mum. We'll sleep.

101
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,478
What did you put in here, bricks?

102
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,190
- You'll be home in two days!
- We need all that!

103
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,958
Alright. Sleep.

104
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,311
Where did he come from?

105
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:03,354
He just came.
Get to sleep, you're getting up early.

106
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,752
Tuesday

107
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,676
Ivan...

108
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:41,556
- What?
- "What, Dad?"

109
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,988
What?

110
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,640
You should say, "What, Dad".

111
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,673
What... Dad?

112
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,275
That's better. What's the problem?

113
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,712
Are you ashamed of calling
your father "Dad"?

114
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,315
- No...
- Don't lie to me!

115
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,675
I'm not lying!

116
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,912
Call me Dad, like a son should!
Got it?

117
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:09,157
- Yes, Dad!
- Well done, son.

118
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:36,109
- Andrei, where are we?
- Are you awake, Shorty?

119
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,958
I thought you'd sleep the whole way!

120
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,596
- You're the one who slept the whole way.
- What?

121
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,431
Are we there yet?

122
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,639
I think another thirty kilometres.

123
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,595
Yes.

124
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:57,232
- Who's he ringing?
- How should I know?

125
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:05,111
- I'm hungry.
- Hold on.

126
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:08,759
The town's not far, we'll eat there.

127
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,598
Dad said so.

128
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,512
- Dad did?
- Yes.

129
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,950
But I'm hungry now!

130
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,719
Ivan, get the flask from the rucksack.

131
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:34,520
Not there, in the pocket!

132
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,794
Thank you.

133
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,871
Drinking and driving?

134
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,754
- Yes, want some?
- No.

135
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,588
Don't take a picture of that rubbish!

136
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,398
Take a picture of me.

137
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,153
Hang on.

138
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,316
Closed.

139
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:53,239
- Dad, the cafe's closed.
- I can see.

140
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,034
Andrei, go find out where we can eat.

141
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,391
- How?
- Ask someone, stupid!

142
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,672
Hurry, get moving!

143
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:19,913
- Where's Andrei?
- I'm hungry.

144
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:22,793
He can find us, he's not a baby.

145
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,959
Andrei!

146
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,719
Come here!

147
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,793
Closer!

148
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,998
- What're you doing here?
- Me?

149
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,915
Yes, you.
What are you doing here?

150
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,590
Dad, I found a restaurant.

151
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:08,349
- It took you 3 hours!
- I just wanted to have a look.

152
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:13,233
While we were waiting
you're standing here wasting time?

153
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,436
This won't happen again, right?

154
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:22,313
- I just wanted...
- Answer me! Right?

155
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,951
I won't do it again, Dad.

156
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,156
Good. Let's go eat.

157
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,590
- lvan, let's go!
- I'm not coming.

158
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:36,234
- Why?
- I am not hungry anymore.

159
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,272
You said you were starving.

160
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,634
It went away

161
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:45,158
Ignore him, Dad.
He's as stubborn as a mule.

162
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:49,876
- You go eat, I'll wait here.
- You're coming with us.

163
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,799
Thank you.

164
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,188
Ivan, you have two minutes to eat.

165
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,519
I'm not hungry.

166
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,233
Your time's running out.

167
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,795
Eat that bread.

168
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,433
It's dirty.

169
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,595
Who do you think is going to eat it?

170
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,830
Nobody. We'll just throw it away.

171
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,509
You've got thirty seconds left.

172
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:04,280
Eat your soup and bread.

173
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,399
I'll be waiting in the car.

174
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:14,110
Sit down and eat your bread and soup.
Got it?

175
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:16,870
Yes.

176
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,112
"Yes, Dad."

177
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,594
Yes.

178
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,635
Alright, sit down.

179
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:04,435
- Is everyone happy and full?
- Yes. Thanks, Dad.

180
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,231
- Yes.
- Good.

181
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,639
Here, call the waitress over and pay.

182
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,910
No, sit down and call her over!

183
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:17,237
- But how?
- With your mouth!

184
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,353
Lady!

185
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:20,991
Lady!

186
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,078
Andrei! "Excuse me."

187
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:28,552
- Excuse me.
- Just a moment.

188
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,757
Wait for me outside!

189
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,235
Hello? Hi, it's me.

190
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:57,633
What was that fit about the food?
Trying to be funny?

191
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,353
Get lost.

192
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,871
Did you see all this money?

193
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,355
- So what?
- Never mind.

194
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,879
Alright, boys!

195
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,830
- Got any money?
- No.

196
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,076
What if I find some?

197
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,388
All right, then.

198
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,639
Sergei, let's go!

199
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,149
They stole the wallet! Get them.

200
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,112
Can't you do it yourself?

201
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,678
Wait for me here!

202
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:37,554
I don't know how it happened.
They just attacked us.

203
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:57,235
If he finds them, he'll kill them!
I would.

204
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,473
Follow me!

205
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,270
- Is it him?
- He stole the money!

206
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,550
- He's yours.
- What do you mean?

207
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,433
He hit you.
Do what you want with him.

208
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,108
- Please, don't!
- Shut up!

209
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:55,318
Go to it, he hit you.

210
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:58,395
No, I don't want to!

211
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:05,633
- lvan, he hit you too. Come on, son!
- Let him go!

212
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,514
- What was the money for?
- I was hungry.

213
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,157
Get out of here!

214
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,953
You have no guts!

215
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,628
- I wasn't ready.
- You should always be ready.

216
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,673
- What if I hadn't got the money back?
- I don't know.

217
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:29,032
- Why didn't you come out?
- I was on the phone.

218
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,395
Andrei, lvan, come here!

219
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,231
Get your stuff.

220
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,717
Don't forget the rods.

221
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:48,114
Andrei,
here's enough for two tickets home.

222
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,435
There's your bus.

223
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,397
- Why?
- I've got business to do!

224
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,791
- What about the waterfalls?
- Next time!

225
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,956
Next time...

226
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,957
In another 12 years?

227
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,318
What did you say?

228
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:09,714
It will be another twelve years before
you take us to the waterfalls again.

229
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:12,514
Did I say something wrong?

230
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,632
- Dad!
- Go with your brother.

231
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,034
Go, go...

232
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:40,838
- It must be about the money.
- No, it's not.

233
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:46,468
Then because you threw a fit
in the restaurant.

234
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:48,988
That's not why!

235
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,875
- What then, brainy?
- He couldn't care less about us.

236
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:55,878
Only an idiot like you can't see it.

237
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,913
- Who's an idiot?
- You!

238
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,392
You're a chicken!

239
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,957
You're a dick!

240
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,918
Get off!

241
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,953
See what an idiot you are!

242
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:31,990
What about your business?
Are we going to the falls?

243
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,919
I've got exactly three days

244
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,839
to get somewhere for business.

245
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,310
Then we'll go to the falls. Alright?

246
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:43,120
Mum's expecting us tomorrow morning.

247
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:47,194
Don't you want to spend
three more days with your dad?

248
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,749
Or wait another 12 years?

249
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,871
What do you think?

250
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:54,351
We wanted to fish.

251
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:57,797
And Mum knows we're with you.
So it's fine with me.

252
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,595
Unanimous!

253
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,356
Andrei, get in, we're off!

254
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:09,190
I'm hungry!

255
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:12,519
- Andrei, are you hungry?
- No.

256
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,678
Me neither. Wait for supper.

257
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,631
I'm off to get one...

258
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,117
- There're so much fish here!
- There are loads!

259
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,995
- Get me one!
- Get it yourself.

260
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:49,676
I dare you to ask me for something else.

261
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,478
Here, eat this!

262
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,672
What do I do with it?

263
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:22,635
We could make fish soup.
Do you know how?

264
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:26,113
Yes, but I don't eat fish.

265
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:31,559
- Why?
- I've had too much fish.

266
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,393
Where?

267
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,593
Far away.

268
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:40,394
Don't forget to put the fire out.

269
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:45,115
Hey, geniuses!
Who puts a tent up like this?

270
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,396
Stretch it out!

271
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,433
Andrei.

272
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,949
- Andrei!
- What?

273
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:20,153
What did he say about fish?
Where could that happen?

274
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:23,837
In the North, maybe.

275
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:28,399
Did you see how quiet he got
when you asked him where?

276
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,232
Why?

277
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:35,519
Who knows?
Maybe he wants to forget.

278
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:42,390
- Why?
- "Why, why"! How would I know?

279
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:52,112
- He lies about everything!
- He's not lying.

280
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:55,079
Who knows where he's been.

281
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:58,030
Why do you suck up to him?

282
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:03,075
- Who sucks up?
- You do! "Dad this, Dad that."

283
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:07,469
- He's a grownup.
- So? Are we short of grownups?

284
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,716
You believe every word he says.

285
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:16,231
And who is he?
He could be a gangster!

286
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,074
He could slit our throats in the forest!

287
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,999
- What?
- You heard!

288
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:26,155
You're stupid, Shorty.

289
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:30,751
We'll see who's stupid
when he gets his knife out.

290
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,396
Go ahead and laugh.

291
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,311
Ivan the fool is about to get slit!

292
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:42,314
- What're you doing?
- Little lvan's going to get slit!

293
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,112
Knock it off!

294
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,759
- Do you give up?
- Get off!

295
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,838
- Give up!
- Don't you get it?

296
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:57,477
How do I know he's our dad?
Why do you believe him?

297
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:01,949
Idiot! Mum said he's our father.

298
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,679
Our father! Got it?

299
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,594
Idiot!

300
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,559
Shorty?

301
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,996
Vanya! Are you crying?

302
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,468
Get lost!

303
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,950
You got these crazy ideas in your head.

304
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,549
I want to go home.

305
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:42,313
Let's go fishing tomorrow.

306
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:46,117
Early in the morning, while he's asleep.

307
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:49,150
They bite a lot at dawn!

308
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:52,033
Okay, Vanya?

309
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:55,039
Alright.

310
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,236
Sleep then.

311
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,038
What's that?

312
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:05,113
The diary, it's your turn.

313
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:09,192
Tomorrow, it's late now.

314
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:13,877
Get the torch, we said every day!

315
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,830
Nothing ever gets past you, does it?

316
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,439
Just write!

317
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:35,631
Wednesday

318
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:27,670
Shorty, get the rods ready.

319
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:28,909
To go where?

320
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:32,398
- Further on.
- Is that what Dad said?

321
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,431
Yes, Dad said. Let's go!

322
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:22,629
Why did we have to go?
They just started biting.

323
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,192
Leave that channel.

324
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,835
I wasted all the bait.

325
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:48,271
Turn it off.

326
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:53,435
I saw a huge pike there!

327
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:56,673
We could have tried the spinning rod.

328
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:02,188
Andrei,
check how much further to Beketovo.

329
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:07,029
Who needs this Beketovo?
There's great fishing here!

330
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:16,398
Why are you complaining?

331
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:20,912
We could have fished more,
we're on holiday.

332
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:34,231
Get out!

333
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,676
Here, fish.

334
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:33,190
So, are they biting?

335
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:36,395
Here, get changed.

336
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:46,354
Tell me why you came.

337
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:48,352
What for?

338
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:52,999
Why did you make us come?

339
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:57,353
You don't need us!

340
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:02,512
We were fine without you!
With Mum and Granny!

341
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:04,711
Why did you come?

342
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:07,753
Why did you take us with you?

343
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:12,870
What do you need us for?
Answer me!

344
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:17,312
- Mum asked me to spend time with you.
- Mum did?

345
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:21,069
- What about you?
- I want to spend time with you too.

346
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:24,636
Why? To taunt us?

347
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:30,077
Get changed.

348
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:58,829
Are we stuck, Dad?

349
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:17,238
Alright, get out of the car.

350
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:22,636
You can at least take your shoes off!

351
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:24,149
What?

352
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:26,672
Ivan, take your shoes off!

353
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:38,516
Here, put your coat on!

354
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:46,079
Cut some branches.

355
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:02,713
Andrei, let's tell him
that we're not going anywhere else!

356
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:05,708
Let's make him take us back home!

357
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:07,433
I don't want to.

358
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:10,279
- How much longer?
- One second.

359
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:20,679
Put the branches under the wheels.

360
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:27,280
I said under, not in front!

361
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,433
But how?

362
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:33,149
With your hands, with your hands!

363
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:36,551
I'll show you once.

364
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:39,469
- Got it?
- Yes.

365
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:42,399
Now, do the same with the other wheel.

366
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:52,199
What are you doing now?

367
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:55,551
What?
Why don't you just do it yourself!

368
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:06,836
Stand behind and push!

369
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:11,593
Push. On the count of three.

370
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:14,234
One, two, three, push. Got it?

371
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:15,868
Got it!

372
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:21,279
Had enough?

373
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:30,038
Go and steer.

374
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:33,400
Throttle on the right,
clutch on the left.

375
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:34,595
I know.

376
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:45,198
Do it!

377
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:51,671
Good work, Andrei!

378
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:53,639
Move it.

379
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:57,036
Ivan, get in!

380
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:30,316
Thursday

381
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:45,836
Dad, what is this place?
Where are we?

382
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:52,830
- Is there anyone here?
- No. Just us.

383
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:56,794
- What are we doing here?
- Nothing.

384
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,639
- We're going to an island.
- An island?

385
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:02,195
Which one? That one?

386
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:04,837
No, another one.

387
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:09,478
Get out.

388
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:45,796
Wind it up tight,
so it won't rock.

389
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:50,068
Found it? Good, put it on the fire.

390
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:55,872
- Dad, what's next?
- We'll tar boat and set sail.

391
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:59,399
- Will it take a long time?
- Yes.

392
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:26,869
Andrei, spread it better
so there are no gaps.

393
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:30,277
That seam there.

394
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:44,710
Let the boat down to the water.

395
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:47,316
Put the things in.

396
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:23,270
Start rowing!

397
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:37,556
What are you staring at? Row!

398
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:39,876
- Where to?
- Straight ahead.

399
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:45,751
Ivan, keep the bow towards the wave,
blockhead!

400
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:47,712
I can't!

401
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:52,952
Row on my command!
Oars up!

402
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:56,273
I said oars up!

403
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:57,955
Row!

404
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:01,756
Heave! Heave!

405
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:04,394
That's it, Andrei!

406
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:07,393
Heave, heave!

407
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:19,199
- I can't go on!
- Yes, you can!

408
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:22,678
You row, you're stronger!

409
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:28,070
Heave, heave!

410
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:13,358
We're here.

411
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:57,714
- Did you hang your wet clothes up?
- Of course, Dad.

412
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:03,670
Hold your breath and drink.

413
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:20,035
- Drink!
- I don't want to.

414
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:22,553
Drink!

415
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:30,078
Wash it down.

416
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:46,554
What, Dad?

417
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:50,957
Go to sleep.

418
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:18,836
How are you, Shorty?

419
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:22,272
If he touches me again, I'll kill him.

420
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:32,232
Damn, it's soaking wet!

421
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:35,598
- Are you serious?
- What?

422
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:39,993
- About killing him?
- If he touches me, I will.

423
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:43,673
I see.

424
01:01:56,840 --> 01:01:59,070
Friday

425
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:13,549
- Where did you get that?
- From the tent.

426
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:16,752
- Is he sleeping?
- He's not there.

427
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,558
Where is he?

428
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:24,673
- Did you steal that?
- Yes.

429
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:31,960
- Put it back now!
- No, I want it with me.

430
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:33,394
Why?

431
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:39,709
- What if he notices his knife's gone?
- I don't care.

432
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:44,199
I didn't do it, he lost it.

433
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:47,440
- You won't tell him, will you?
- Of course not.

434
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:49,198
Then what's the problem?

435
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:54,037
I saw a fish jumping by the shore.

436
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:57,034
It was this big!

437
01:02:57,720 --> 01:03:00,792
We need worms though.
That one won't go for bread.

438
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:04,352
Don't bring the knife.
Not now, later.

439
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:06,516
No, I want to have it with me.

440
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:07,675
Let's go, sleepy-heads!

441
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:11,430
I'll show you the island.

442
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:17,911
- What about breakfast?
- You can have it later. Let's go!

443
01:03:20,360 --> 01:03:22,669
- lvan, what's wrong?
- My leg hurts.

444
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:27,315
Your leg?
It probably fell asleep, let's go.

445
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:29,596
My leg hurts!

446
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:35,476
If it doesn't go away you can come back.

447
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:29,631
Follow me, kids!

448
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:32,796
Now you'll see.

449
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:44,679
- Well, are you coming up?
- Go on, go on...

450
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:46,638
Are you scared?

451
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:49,118
My leg hurts.

452
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:30,271
- Give me your hand. Where's lvan?
- He didn't come.

453
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,389
He's scared of heights, Dad.

454
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:36,869
Cool!

455
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:38,678
Come here!

456
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:44,756
Look over there!

457
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:46,350
Wow!

458
01:07:08,360 --> 01:07:11,158
Andrei, get down, quickly!

459
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:32,910
Do you know this joke?

460
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:38,228
A guy rings:
"Hello, is that the missile base?"

461
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:39,998
"You got the wrong number."

462
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:43,351
"No, you're the one
who got the wrong number, dear!"

463
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:48,350
Another one. A guy is riding a camel...

464
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:52,633
Okay, that's enough.
Thanks for the company.

465
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:56,833
Andrei and I will get some wood,
you wash dishes, lvan.

466
01:07:57,040 --> 01:08:01,352
- Why do I have to wash up?
- Last one cleans up.

467
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:16,550
Not bad, for the first time.

468
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:18,428
You know...

469
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:23,151
your bowl sank.

470
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:25,354
Sank?

471
01:09:28,680 --> 01:09:30,796
A wave carried it away.

472
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:34,432
A wave?

473
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:37,795
How am I supposed to eat now?

474
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:40,517
I didn't do it on purpose.

475
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:45,595
Alright, I'll show you how
to make a bowl from wood.

476
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:49,270
- I won't be able to.
- I'll teach you.

477
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:17,438
- Now what's wrong?
- Nothing.

478
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:19,998
Look after yourselves for a bit.

479
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:24,110
- Where are you going, Dad?
- For a walk.

480
01:10:24,360 --> 01:10:29,115
We need worms.
The fish here won't go for bread.

481
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:30,475
Find some.

482
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:33,393
Easier said than done...

483
01:10:34,040 --> 01:10:35,473
It's all sand round here!

484
01:10:35,720 --> 01:10:39,793
- Why did he take the rucksack?
- Maybe to pick mushrooms.

485
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:47,513
Why don't we go into the forest
to get some worms?

486
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:52,671
- It's too far.
- But we need the worms.

487
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:54,439
Then let's go.

488
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:56,472
Bring a jar.

489
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:02,228
- Will this do?
- It will do fine!

490
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:32,475
- Is this really an island?
- Yes, I'm telling you it is.

491
01:11:32,680 --> 01:11:35,911
I was up on the tower,
there is water all around.

492
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:40,318
- No one else is here?
- Looks that way.

493
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:53,918
- It's probably 100 years old.
- Probably.

494
01:13:07,480 --> 01:13:10,517
- Andrei, where are you?
- I'm coming.

495
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:17,239
Come here.

496
01:13:18,280 --> 01:13:22,159
- Look.
- How did this pit get here?

497
01:13:22,360 --> 01:13:25,397
Who cares, it's full of worms!

498
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:32,352
Where's the jar?

499
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:56,350
The fish will be begging for these worms.

500
01:13:56,560 --> 01:14:00,075
- Shall we cast from the shore?
- No, from the boat.

501
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:03,198
Wait, we have to get Dad's permission.

502
01:14:04,120 --> 01:14:05,917
- Vanya!
- Why?

503
01:14:06,160 --> 01:14:08,549
Can't we row on our own?

504
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:10,472
Come on, push.

505
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:29,036
- Where are you going? Get back here!
- We won't go far.

506
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:32,036
Dad, we won't be long!

507
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:44,477
Here, be back in an hour.

508
01:14:44,720 --> 01:14:47,792
- At 3:30. We have to leave.
- Got it, Dad.

509
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,116
Come on, sit down.

510
01:14:58,040 --> 01:15:00,600
Be back here in an hour!

511
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:05,396
- And stay where I can see you.
- Got it, Dad.

512
01:15:07,320 --> 01:15:09,390
"Got it, Dad!"

513
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:13,277
You're asking for it, Shorty!
I'm warning you!

514
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:29,950
Shorty, let's go.
It's already three o'clock.

515
01:15:30,240 --> 01:15:32,993
Dad said to be back in half an hour.

516
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:35,760
I'll just cast a couple more times.

517
01:15:38,240 --> 01:15:41,516
There's no point.
They're not biting today.

518
01:15:41,960 --> 01:15:45,157
Andrei, let's go a little further.

519
01:15:45,680 --> 01:15:48,478
- Dad said to go back!
- Will you stop nagging?

520
01:15:48,680 --> 01:15:51,717
Just a bit further then we'll go back.

521
01:15:53,720 --> 01:15:55,870
Alright, come on then.

522
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:19,715
Andrei! Come here!

523
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:21,756
Hurry!

524
01:17:27,720 --> 01:17:28,914
What's wrong?

525
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:32,079
I saw a huge fish there!

526
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:32,911
Where?

527
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:36,717
- Andrei, run and get the rod!
- Why me?

528
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:38,239
- Hurry!
- Shit!

529
01:17:42,720 --> 01:17:44,472
What'll we tell dad?

530
01:17:44,720 --> 01:17:48,599
That we caught a fish
but it wasn't your idea.

531
01:18:28,840 --> 01:18:32,435
- Look what we caught!
- Andrei, what time is it?

532
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:36,110
- What?
- What time does your watch say?

533
01:18:37,680 --> 01:18:39,432
Seven o'clock, Dad...

534
01:18:39,640 --> 01:18:43,519
- When were you supposed to be back?
- At half past three...

535
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:45,478
Did you see this fish?

536
01:18:45,720 --> 01:18:47,631
I'm not talking to you.

537
01:18:50,360 --> 01:18:52,590
Why were you late?

538
01:18:52,840 --> 01:18:54,068
Well, you see...

539
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:55,949
What are you doing?

540
01:18:56,200 --> 01:18:58,839
- Did you hear me calling you?
- No!

541
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:02,674
Don't even think about hitting me!

542
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:04,313
Let me explain, the fish...

543
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:07,751
- Why did I give you the watch?
- So, I'd have the time.

544
01:19:07,960 --> 01:19:09,996
- And what happened?
- We caught a fish!

545
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:14,553
Don't touch him, it was me!
We found a ship!

546
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:18,110
Daddy, it's true!
It was lvan.

547
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:20,231
But you had the watch!

548
01:19:20,440 --> 01:19:24,353
What do you want from me?
You're a coward, scum!

549
01:19:25,400 --> 01:19:27,630
Kill me then, just kill me!

550
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:30,631
You're a bastard! I hate you!

551
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:32,717
- Kill you?
- Yes!

552
01:19:32,920 --> 01:19:35,115
- Kill you?
- Yes!

553
01:19:35,720 --> 01:19:39,395
Stop! Touch him and I'll kill you!

554
01:19:40,160 --> 01:19:42,674
- You'll kill me?
- Get back!

555
01:19:45,320 --> 01:19:46,958
Get back!

556
01:19:48,120 --> 01:19:49,348
Don't move!

557
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:54,230
If you weren't so evil
I could love you like a father!

558
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:58,109
I hate you!
Don't even think about hurting us!

559
01:19:58,440 --> 01:20:00,317
You're no one!

560
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:04,110
- You're wrong, son...
- No, no, no!

561
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:06,668
Ivan!

562
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:09,472
Stay here!

563
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:21,515
Ivan!

564
01:20:39,200 --> 01:20:40,394
Ivan!

565
01:20:46,240 --> 01:20:47,593
Dad!

566
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:02,669
Ivan, wait for me.

567
01:21:12,240 --> 01:21:14,549
Stop, lvan!

568
01:21:39,960 --> 01:21:42,599
Go away! I hate you!

569
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:44,916
Son, open up! Let me in!

570
01:21:45,240 --> 01:21:48,437
- What do you want, go away!
- Son, please.

571
01:21:48,640 --> 01:21:52,110
If you don't leave, I'll jump!
Hear that, I'll jump!

572
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:56,518
- Don't move, wait for me.
- Did you hear me, I'll jump!

573
01:22:04,360 --> 01:22:06,078
I can do it!

574
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:07,594
I can!

575
01:22:08,680 --> 01:22:10,511
You hear, I can!

576
01:22:12,920 --> 01:22:14,433
Did you hear me?

577
01:22:14,760 --> 01:22:17,832
Hear that? I can do anything!

578
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:20,915
Asshole, I can do it!

579
01:22:24,280 --> 01:22:25,633
Vanya, son...

580
01:22:56,840 --> 01:22:58,273
Andrei...

581
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:00,393
He's dead.

582
01:23:15,200 --> 01:23:18,033
We have to take him away.

583
01:23:18,240 --> 01:23:19,958
Where to?

584
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:23,318
The boat.

585
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:25,952
How?

586
01:23:26,160 --> 01:23:27,878
"With your hands"!

587
01:23:34,920 --> 01:23:38,196
What are you looking at?
Take him by his legs.

588
01:23:53,360 --> 01:23:54,873
I can't.

589
01:23:56,440 --> 01:23:57,668
Come here.

590
01:23:59,040 --> 01:24:01,190
We'll drag him by his arms.

591
01:24:28,760 --> 01:24:32,230
- Get the axe.
- What for?

592
01:24:32,440 --> 01:24:35,432
I said get the axe, idiot!

593
01:25:31,680 --> 01:25:33,796
I can't, Andrei.

594
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,389
Hang on, we can rest a little.

595
01:25:50,160 --> 01:25:53,436
- It's the wrong way, Andrei.
- It's the right way.

596
01:25:53,640 --> 01:25:55,790
We're lost, I'm telling you.

597
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,036
Get up, let's go.

598
01:26:00,520 --> 01:26:01,669
Andrei!

599
01:26:04,120 --> 01:26:04,950
What?

600
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:07,355
What should we do?

601
01:26:08,440 --> 01:26:10,476
His eyes are open.

602
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:26,470
Get up, let's go.

Let's load everything in.

605
01:31:17,240 --> 01:31:22,189
- What was that?
- I don't know. We hit a stone.

606
01:34:03,680 --> 01:34:06,513
Let's take the stuff to the car.

607
01:34:58,640 --> 01:35:00,392
Wait.

608
01:35:01,320 --> 01:35:03,436
We'll put him inside.

609
01:35:28,320 --> 01:35:29,514
Dad!

610
01:35:30,240 --> 01:35:31,355

Look!

614
01:37:12,600 --> 01:37:13,555
Hide it.

615
01:37:18,520 --> 01:37:22,798
