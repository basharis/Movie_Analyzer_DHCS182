1
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,485
I sell mayhem, scandal, murder, and doom.

2
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,525
Oh, Jesus, I do.

3
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,365
I sell the newborn and the dead.

4
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:46,128
I sell the wretched, magnificent city
of New York back to its people.

5
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,043
I sell newspapers.

6
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,161
Thanks for your time. Yeah?

7
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,322
Porter. I got a shooting, plus a fire.

8
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,722
- Mm. Any bodies?
- At least two, Projects on Avenue D.

9
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,205
Paul said something about a kid.

10
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,647
I'm on it. I'm on it. Thanks.

11
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,445
I'm always running to the place
where the bad thing just happened,

12
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,841
arriving just after the danger has passed,

13
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,805
watching from a safe distance,
searching for an angle,

14
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,042
that little wrinkle, the kick to the heart

15
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,802
that makes you want to put down
the dollar and pick up the paper.

16
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,887
With three deadlines a week,
I'm always looking for a good story.

17
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,484
I seen the smoke,
and I'm looking up there.

18
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,843
And that's when Demetrius,
he come jumping through that window.

19
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:46,402
And he on fire, burning like all over.

20
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,805
And he holding Vernon here.

21
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:52,725
And Demetrius, he fall, fall, and fall.

22
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,925
I can see he gonna land
on top of the baby.

23
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,005
And then just before Demetrius land,
he do this little kind of flip.

24
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,162
And he landed on his back.

25
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,971
And he holding the baby up, like...

26
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,924
And I can see that he do that on purpose.

27
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,245
What did you do?

28
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:13,210
I run over and I pick up Vernon here.

29
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,844
And I see Demetrius.

30
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,923
He just not gonna make it,
because he landed on his back like that.

31
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,002
Hey, little man.

32
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,725
I'm sorry that happened to you
and your daddy. You okay?

33
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,325
No, no, no, he don't talk yet.

34
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:35,364
Fall, fall, fall.

35
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,003
Thanks for your time.

36
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,244
Hey, you're the one that helped
them find that little girl?

37
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,845
I write a column for a daily newspaper.

38
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,481
In other words, I'm an endangered species.

39
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,564
I used to think my stories
could make a difference.

40
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,525
Now I just hope they are
enough to feed my family.

41
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:17,562
These days, eight million kids have
iPhones and post their videos on YouTube

42
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:21,005
like they're actually reporting
and commenting on something.

43
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,965
My wife says I sound old.

44
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:27,522
I'm heading into a long one,
so you'll probably get home before me.

45
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,405
Josephine needs to get paid.

46
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,765
And please remember to scrub
the pots and pans.

47
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,125
You keep leaving them for me.

48
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,850
Yeah, well, they have to soak overnight.

49
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,564
Oh, yeah?

50
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,165
- Yeah.
- Really?

51
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,725
Is that what your mother told you?

52
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,001
Well, look, I got to go, baby.

53
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,320
- Wait, Porter.
- What?

54
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,129
Did you remember your tuxedo?

55
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,325
Yeah, but I don't want to go.

56
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,125
Everyone's going to be
sucking up to Hobbs...

57
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,926
You know, if they're really thinking about
cutting your column, you better go.

58
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,604
I know you are a watcher,
Mr. Wren, but it is rude to stare.

59
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,365
I'm sorry. I was just trying
to figure out where I knew you from.

60
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,005
I see you recognize me, though.

61
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,684
From your cheesy picture.

62
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,684
The one that goes with my column.

63
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:06,045
Your smug expression is annoying.

64
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,005
It was taken last year,

65
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,445
in the waning moments of my youth.

66
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,204
Right before they retired the film camera?

67
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,965
- Wow.
- Sorry.

68
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,725
Does anyone actually read
the newspaper anymore?

69
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,605
Well, I have a few fans
of the print edition.

70
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:24,445
I'm told they Twitter at me.

71
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,522
I think they Twitter
about how awesome it is,

72
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:30,445
the feel of the paper,
the smell of the ink.

73
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,409
Hashtag-well-written-column.

74
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,484
Well... I do like the feel of the paper.

75
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,803
And your column, Mr. Wren,
is always very well written,

76
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,287
in an old-time, classic kind of way.

77
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,245
- Well...
- I do wonder, though.

78
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:52,765
It must be depressing for you
to be in all those places

79
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,604
right after a terrible thing has happened.

80
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,165
You must have seen so many awful things.

81
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,402
I've seen a few things.

82
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,245
People seem to open up to you.

83
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,365
You must have a skill for
asking the right questions.

84
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:10,281
Usually people want to tell somebody,
and I'm just there at the right time.

85
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,328
Come on. You're being modest.

86
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,365
What brings you to the party?

87
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:20,722
My boyfriend, Charlie's bank,
does some kind of business with the company

88
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,564
that I guess just bought your paper.

89
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,525
You all work for Hobbs now, I guess.

90
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,365
"All" meaning mankind? Yes.

91
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,325
You grateful you landed a job
that pays you to stare at people?

92
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,329
Look...

93
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,645
I deal with bullshitters all day.

94
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,605
But I'm on my own time here,
so, if this is all going somewhere,

95
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,250
get to it already.

96
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,965
Well, it's complicated.
It takes some time to explain.

97
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,883
Oh.

98
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,281
Could we leave right now
and go back to my apartment?

99
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,325
It's only 15 blocks from here.

100
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,562
Charlie wouldn't be coming.

101
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,848
Is this about your husband's death?

102
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,565
Porter Wren, is it?

103
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,685
Yes.

104
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,922
You must come and have
a word with Mr. Hobbs.

105
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,764
He's quite eager to meet you.

106
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,010
Excuse me.

107
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:36,526
This is Porter Wren, the investigative
reporter who found the girl.

108
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,965
Excuse me, Mr. Hobbs?

109
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:46,402
Mr. Porter Wren, sir, famed investigative
reporter who now writes the column.

110
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,965
Really?

111
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,325
Yeah?

112
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,965
I really think this could happen.

113
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,371
I think it's very prudent.

114
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,047
Every single...

115
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,801
Wonderful.

116
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:19,161
The invitation still stands?

117
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,764
Yes.

118
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,890
Come in.

119
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,962
I want to show you this.

120
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,004
Okay, this is what we're talking about.

121
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,365
This is where we start.

122
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,920
- This is where we start?
- Yes.

123
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,446
- Another drink?
- Why not?

124
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,526
To help you through the gates of hell.

125
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,163
This is a police report.

126
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,042
It's a bit stingy with the tonic and ice.

127
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,525
Well, I want you drunk, so I can
tell whether you are a lout or not.

128
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,001
You know you can get in a lot
of trouble for having these files?

129
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,161
Detectives don't even let other
cops see these things.

130
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,443
I know that.

131
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:38,682
Okay. So, Simon Crowley was found
in the rubble of a demolished building.

132
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,964
Surrounding the body were
small pieces of jade.

133
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,162
Police have no idea how he got in there,
given the high fence with wire,

134
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,847
nor can they determine the cause
of death because of the...

135
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,565
The bulldozers
and the rats. You can say it.

136
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:58,849
I've read the report 17 times.

137
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,326
I'm sorry.

138
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,322
"The world-famous filmmaker
appears incapable of smiling."

139
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,403
Clearly.
"Several hours into the interview...

140
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,685
I came to realize that Simon Crowley..."

141
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,645
Thank you.

142
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:24,965
"...is not a nice person, particularly,
and he doesn't care if you know it.

143
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:29,725
In his pursuit of great movies,
woman upon woman, and cigarettes,

144
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,883
in that order, niceness is irrelevant."

145
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,003
Mixed review.

146
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:44,681
- Is that Best Director?
- Best Original Screenplay.

147
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,761
Apparently it's what they give you

148
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,605
when they want to give you
Best Director but they can't.

149
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,364
VANTAGES

150
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,124
FILMMAKER CROWLEY FOUND DEAD

151
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,245
They still can't figure out
how he got in there.

152
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,369
The place was all locked up and
he didn't have a key on him.

153
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,649
What's the story with the pieces of jade?

154
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,404
No idea.

155
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,282
Could I have my coat, please?

156
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:48,004
I hope you don't feel like
I've wasted your time.

157
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,531
Here's my number.

158
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,881
When the gate shuts, my work and the city

159
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,800
remain on the other side of the wall
that surrounds our hidden home.

160
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:24,403
Lisa and I fell in love with this house
when we were first married.

161
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:29,122
There's something about it surviving
hundreds of years, like a secret.

162
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,440
It kept me honest.

163
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:35,364
Anywhere else, this house
should be mundane.

164
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,923
But in Manhattan, it was a miracle.

165
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,845
My family slept inside, safe from
the dangers of these dark streets,

166
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:49,605
secluded too from the world of Caroline
Crowley and her famous dead husband,

167
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,285
who could not enter this sacred place,

168
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:56,524
unless, of course, I brought
them home with me.

169
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,445
Did you redo it yesterday?

170
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,602
- It happened too late.
- Daddy-bird!

171
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,045
Saved the wedding dress part just for you.

172
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,325
All right. I'm on it.

173
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,765
I'm on it. Thanks.

174
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,642
Classy quote from the gymnastics coach.

175
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,608
You see what they put for the headline?

176
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:18,325
- The Pulitzer is waiting.
- I liked it.

177
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,482
You okay?

178
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,040
Yeah, I'll be all right in a few hours.

179
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,445
You didn't drive home last night, did you?

180
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:27,490
No. I left the car in the lot.

181
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,485
Oh. Excuse me.

182
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,201
- Sally, come. We need to get dressed.
- Oh, no, but I...

183
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,282
- Tommy, let's go.
- Never!

184
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,645
- Morning, Josephine.
- Tommy?

185
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,121
- I don't wanna come.
- Tommy.

186
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,680
Tommy. Don't you kick me.

187
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,724
- Yes. I got him.
- Pick him up.

188
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,405
There you go.

189
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,365
You better come on with me.

190
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,363
- Get your tush under control.
- Come on here.

191
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,444
Josephine, if you could pick up
the house a bit today, it'd be great.

192
00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:00,685
Like, maybe you could do, like, the dishes,
or maybe do the pots in the sink?

193
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,525
You know, she ignores me all the time.

194
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,207
Oh, listen. I have an important surgery
that I have to do tomorrow night,

195
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:11,484
so I won't be able to go to that
dinner with Lorca and Cabot.

196
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,324
Well, I'm not going without you.

197
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,641
We've rescheduled that, like, four times.

198
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:19,850
I'm sorry. It's a visiting
Iranian ambassador with an emergency.

199
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:23,165
Let's just stop pretending it's
effective to have a sex life.

200
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,565
What?

201
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:27,883
To schedule a night out, yeah?

202
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:39,365
Do you need a ride somewhere
this morning, Mr. Grumpy Pants?

203
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,005
- Yes.
- Where are you going?

204
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,890
Upper West Side.

205
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,845
Get dressed.

206
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,165
Morning.

207
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:08,205
I like the girl with the mob,
but I need some quotes about Iris.

208
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:11,682
I'm going to reach out to her mother.
I'm going to try to track her down.

209
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,962
- All right. Thanks, Bobby.
- Later.

210
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,451
Yeah.

211
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,969
Oh, God.

212
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,325
Hello?

213
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,685
Hey, it's Porter Wren.

214
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,240
Well, hello, Porter Wren.

215
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,525
How are you feeling?

216
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,523
Did you roofie me last night?

217
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,965
No, I didn't.

218
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,168
Why are you calling me?

219
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,410
"Opportunity only knocks once"?

220
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,324
Hey.

221
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,562
I just rode up the elevator
with Leonardo DiCaprio.

222
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,041
Oh, yeah. He's got a friend upstairs.

223
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,084
So, tell me how you met Simon.

224
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:08,846
I was living a sort of tired,

225
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:13,522
pretty girl, New York life,
you know? I had no money.

226
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:18,125
I had given up on L.A.
after a year, and moved here.

227
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,485
I was apartment-sitting for rich people,

228
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,685
with no steady income or place to live.

229
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:30,005
And I had just been fired for refusing
to date my asshole lawyer boss

230
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,845
whose firm I was answering phones for.

231
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:36,606
Did you have a laundry line hanging in
the backyard when you were growing up?

232
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,521
Excuse me?

233
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,485
You know, with jeans and t-shirts

234
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:45,525
and underwear hanging in the backyard?

235
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,090
A laundry line.

236
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,441
Yeah, actually, I did.

237
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,045
Me, too. I didn't like
my underwear hanging out there

238
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,088
for the other kids to see,

239
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:58,965
but I did enjoy my one friend's
mom's brassiere...

240
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:02,681
- Right.
- ...hanging on their laundry line.

241
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:07,483
He bought me a couple more drinks,
and we had an amazing conversation

242
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:11,605
about our childhoods and parents.

243
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,931
I knew who he was.
I recognized him right away.

244
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,925
- He was very smart.
- Caroline.

245
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,445
I'm going to ask you one, crazy question,

246
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,405
but it's serious, not a joke.

247
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,561
Okay.

248
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,404
I want to marry you.

249
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,485
Now, I know it sounds completely crazy,

250
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,525
but I had just been sitting there thinking

251
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,565
how I was probably going
to have to leave New York,

252
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:44,362
and in walks this enigmatic, weird,

253
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,771
brilliant human being.

254
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,685
- Yes.
- Jesus. God.

255
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,364
So, you met him in a bar.

256
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,370
- Jesus.
- He proposed. You said yes.

257
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:58,205
All within the span of less than an hour?

258
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,485
Well, a few hours, but, yeah.

259
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,561
Okay.

260
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,085
I got a package from him the next day

261
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:07,165
containing a flash drive
and an engagement ring.

262
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,283
You want to see the video?

263
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,447
Sure.

264
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,645
Hey, Caroline.

265
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,767
Hey.

266
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:24,082
I've been thinking about you
since I left you earlier today.

267
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:28,324
I was thinking about our, uh,
wedding vows and everything,

268
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,883
and about how
the regular vows are, "I do,"

269
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,122
and how that won't do, actually.

270
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,965
So, I decided I want to make
my vows to you here, right now,

271
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,405
this, this minute, exactly.

272
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,642
And I have no idea what I'm going to say.

273
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,563
But once it's done,
it'll be my vows to you, okay?

274
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,605
So, after I said goodbye to you,

275
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:51,002
I had dinner with, uh, Jessica Chastain.

276
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:55,170
She wants to be in my next
movie, Strange Day.

277
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,602
And she looks good.

278
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,364
There was nothing wrong
with the conversation.

279
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:04,684
She was very smart and funny,
and whatever,

280
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,525
but she wasn't you, Caroline.

281
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:11,207
I didn't get that "click" from her.

282
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,766
I got the click from you.

283
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,125
I got the click.

284
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,243
When I was in high school, I got a job
as a busboy at this place in the Village,

285
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,725
Dante's Café. But that was, uh,

286
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:27,168
that was a big, big thing for me.

287
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:31,602
I made some money and I got my first
camera, and I could watch all the people.

288
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:34,923
There was this very beautiful
model who started coming in,

289
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,645
her name was Ashley Montgomery.

290
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:42,925
I would save her used cigarettes
with that perfect lipstick smudge,

291
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,243
faintest trace of her perfume on them,

292
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,405
and, when I got home,
I would lie naked in my bed

293
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,685
and I would lay the cigarette
butts all over my body,

294
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:56,321
even under my tongue, and even in
my ass, once, while I jerked off.

295
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,004
I did not consider this strange.

296
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,242
I'm sorry, is this still
his marriage proposal?

297
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:03,364
- Yeah.
- I was certain that I would never...

298
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,805
be loved, never.

299
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:10,442
I swore that, if I ever had the
chance for somebody I loved,

300
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,645
I would take it right away.
And when I saw you today,

301
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,485
I saw a woman who could take it,
who could take me,

302
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,404
who could fucking kick it back
at me, if she had to.

303
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:23,482
This is my excitement...

304
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,931
and my terror.

305
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:32,129
My heart thrills to your heart, Caroline.

306
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:38,087
My dark heart to your dark heart.

307
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:43,200
That is my vow, Caroline, my vow to you.

308
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,805
This is a song that makes me think of you.

309
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:52,484
We were secretly married
in New York three days later.

310
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,165
Showed a real affection for me.

311
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,483
In the first six months, we were
surprisingly happy together.

312
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:02,723
And this one night, when...

313
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:07,124
when Simon didn't come
home, I got worried.

314
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:11,330
But I didn't call the police because
I knew Simon would be pissed if I did.

315
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:17,847
Three days went by, and it was pretty
clear then that something was wrong.

316
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,251
Look, Caroline...

317
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:28,009
if the police can't figure out how or why
Simon died, I honestly don't think I can.

318
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,369
But you found that little girl.

319
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,803
Don't people tell you all kinds of things?

320
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,564
Honestly?

321
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,165
I found that little girl by mistake.

322
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,725
It was random luck.

323
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,406
I didn't deserve any credit for that.

324
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:50,963
Mostly, people tell me stories.

325
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,842
I never press them.

326
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:59,482
They just tell me 'cause
they want to be known.

327
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,290
You seem to be searching
for something else.

328
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,045
You had to know that by coming here today,

329
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,726
I was going to ask for your help.

330
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:19,009
Unless, of course, there was
another reason why you came by.

331
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,725
I should go.

332
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,447
Can I have my coat, please?

333
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,490
Come on.

334
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,402
Oh, shit.

335
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,009
Caroline?

336
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,250
Hello?

337
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,565
It's just me.

338
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,369
I forgot my phone.

339
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,445
- Oh, my God.
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry.

340
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:09,091
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
- Oh, my God.

341
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,364
What are you doing here?

342
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,165
I'm really sorry. I forgot my phone.

343
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,365
- I'm...
- You scared the shit out of me.

344
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,485
How'd you get in here?

345
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,885
I saw... I saw the code.

346
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,086
I'm sorry.

347
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,760
You were watching me just now?

348
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,888
I'm really sorry. I...

349
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,122
You liked watching me, didn't you?

350
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,005
I couldn't help it. I'm sorry.

351
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,447
I was thinking of you.

352
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,363
I got to go. I...

353
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,561
Okay. Goodbye, watcher.

354
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,007
Glad you got a good view.

355
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,685
You know, you were right.

356
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:01,321
Opportunity really only does knock once.

357
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:15,927
Hey. I'm watching you, Caroline.

358
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,168
I see everything.

359
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,325
No, Tommy. Tommy, I need the washcloth.

360
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,164
I need your face.

361
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:01,244
I need your face. Just real quick.

362
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,810
- Real quick.
- Daddy-bird!

363
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,885
- Hello.
- Okay. Give me the washcloth.

364
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,925
- How's my family, huh?
- Tommy, I need the washcloth.

365
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,205
- Hey, you. Hi.
- Hi, sweetheart.

366
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,282
Hello to you.

367
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,488
I think Tommy peed in the tub again.

368
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,965
Oh, Thomas.

369
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,925
Honey, can you take care of it? Thank you.

370
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,685
Sure. That's my cue,
after urination in the tub?

371
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,330
Yeah, that's your cue.

372
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,488
How was your day?

373
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:28,445
Busy. Yours?

374
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,681
Swell.

375
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:36,645
I had awoke with the odd desire to visit
the site of the demolished building

376
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,685
- where Simon's body had been found.
- Excuse me?

377
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:44,322
537 East 111th Street
was now just a vacant lot.

378
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:48,245
And it held no answers to the questions
that were troubling me.

379
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:52,609
Did Simon die in the rubble or was he in
the building before it was demolished?

380
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,485
And if he was in the building, why?

381
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,922
And how did he get in there,
if he didn't have the key?

382
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,083
In the building next door,
the super, Luis,

383
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:06,045
didn't have anything to add since
the investigation 17 months ago.

384
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:10,005
Any reason you can think of why
the victim might have a key?

385
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:14,085
Sure. Lots of reasons. It's a big city.

386
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,487
Thank you for your time.

387
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:25,408
With my nagging guilt growing, I needed
some time to think this whole thing over.

388
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:31,445
I told myself I'd never
see Caroline again.

389
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:36,691
And yet, when she called,
I told her I'd meet her for lunch.

390
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:41,082
Well, I don't feel guilty.

391
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,961
You know, Porter, I'm actually
kind of alone.

392
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,165
I have Charlie, but I can't talk
to him about everything.

393
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:52,323
Simon is very much a taboo subject.

394
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:56,405
Charlie's already started
looking at houses in New Jersey.

395
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,645
White picket fence, garden in the back.

396
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,121
Two-point-five kids?

397
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:10,521
You're the only one that I can
talk to about any of this.

398
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:17,644
And there's something that
I would like to show you, today, now,

399
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:20,246
if you still have the time for me.

400
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,603
You keep money in this bank?

401
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,763
No. I keep Simon here.

402
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:49,605
This, as much as anything,
was who Simon was.

403
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:55,530
I'm going to need you to understand this.

404
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,085
Simon was very unhappy all of his life.

405
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:04,370
He was always...
"searching for the truth".

406
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:12,125
On each of these video cards is some truth
that he was proud to have captured.

407
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:15,409
And if he wasn't happy with it,
he would throw it out.

408
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:20,283
He used to treat these like
original film in a camera.

409
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:23,523
He would never reuse or copy them.

410
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:26,285
He likes them being completely individual,

411
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:29,364
as a single source of the truth.

412
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:34,204
Okay. So, which do we watch first?

413
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:38,080
I'm not staying. I'm sorry.

414
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:41,403
I've seen them all so many
times, it's exhausting.

415
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:44,609
I'll let them know up front
that you'll be here a while.

416
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,686
Okay.

417
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,682
Thank you, Porter.

418
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:53,604
It's one of the weirder
moments in my life.

419
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:56,206
Call me when you're done.

420
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:58,971
Okay.

421
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:45,288
- Stop.
- Really?

422
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,641
There's one. Pull over. Pull over.

423
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:53,085
All right, pull over, Max. Over.

424
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,844
- Hey, hey.
- What's happening tonight?

425
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,604
I'm cold and lonely out here.

426
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,569
- We're lonely in here, too.
- Round the world is 200.

427
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,281
She for you, Billy?

428
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,325
Too ugly for me. Can't spend that much.

429
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,965
She's not ugly. She's,
she's, she's plain, perhaps.

430
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,281
She's nondescript, generic.

431
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,124
Billy, it sounds like you're interested.

432
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,005
I could be interested.
I could be very interested.

433
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,241
What's your names? What's your names?

434
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:15,925
- Billy. Simon.
- Oh, yeah.

435
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,725
- Come on, Billy, Simon.
- I like her.

436
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,961
Get in here.

437
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,848
I don't know why I like
her, but I like her. Get in.

438
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,485
She says something.

439
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,925
She's in it. She says something.

440
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,490
- Yeah.
- Hello.

441
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:36,846
Simon?

442
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:40,965
Hey.

443
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,765
Can you let me in?

444
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:45,320
I changed the lock.

445
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:48,324
Okay, fine. Open the door.

446
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,965
First you must answer me three questions.

447
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,165
Jesus, come on, Simon, let me in.
I really have to pee.

448
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:57,445
Three honest answers is all I require.

449
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:00,325
Question one: When I'm in L.A.,
how often do you masturbate?

450
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,370
Come on. Fuck you. Open the door.

451
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,205
Jesus Christ.

452
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,085
Every day, at least once.

453
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:13,765
Question two: Have you ever
fantasized about being with Billy?

454
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,725
Yes.

455
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,445
Third question, please.

456
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:22,365
Question three: When you finally
tracked down your biological father,

457
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,325
what was the last sentence he said to you?

458
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,445
Fuck you. I am not
playing this game anymore.

459
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,405
Really? That's your choice.

460
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:32,365
Come on. You already know the answer to
that question, you sick fuck. Open the door.

461
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:34,725
I win.

462
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,406
Oh, my God.

463
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,684
He said, "You ain't my daughter.

464
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:43,206
Now get the fuck out of
my sight. And when I..."

465
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,561
The last thing he said.

466
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:48,765
The last thing he said was,

467
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:51,446
"Unless you want to give me a blowjob."

468
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,803
You want to order some food?

469
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:06,565
The fuck is wrong with you?

470
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:27,402
- Yeah?
- Mr. Wren?

471
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:30,845
This is Waldon Campbell
from Mr. Hobbs' office.

472
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,684
He'd like to meet with you immediately.

473
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:35,491
Himself?

474
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,800
Excuse me.

475
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,730
Hey.

476
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:38,767
Fuck.

477
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,484
Nice view.

478
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,080
Mr. Porter Wren!

479
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,845
Chronicler of people's woes.

480
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:02,003
Good afternoon, sir. Good of you to come.

481
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:05,323
Oh, do, please, sit down,

482
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:09,925
since I'd like to discuss
a certain matter.

483
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,206
Do sit down.

484
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,642
You, sir, are having an affair
with Miss Caroline Crowley.

485
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,761
That's of no...

486
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:27,083
Please, please, please.
I ask you not to interrupt.

487
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:33,281
Now, Miss Crowley has been
sending me a video

488
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,805
on a digital card from a camera.

489
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:39,805
It's the same one each time.

490
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:41,525
What's on it?

491
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:45,446
Something... very compromising.

492
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:52,005
She's asking for money in return?

493
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,684
No, no, no requests.

494
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:59,164
Oh, she's bloody fucking
psychologically clever, you know.

495
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:01,685
Are you certain
she's the one sending them?

496
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,565
She is the only one who would

497
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:07,291
logically be in possession of it.

498
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:11,725
Okay. So, I ask her about it.

499
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:14,005
And she tells me she's not sending it.

500
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:17,125
And I look through her stuff,
and I don't find it.

501
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,884
Then what?

502
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:23,284
Then, you keep going, sir.

503
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:25,806
You make do.

504
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,565
Look, this is crazy.

505
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:29,845
You are my employee.

506
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,366
And I can have you fired and replaced

507
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:35,609
in the time it takes me
to tie my shoelaces.

508
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:38,644
I'm quite familiar with
your financials, sir.

509
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:44,204
Your salary just about
covers your mortgage,

510
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:49,725
and your wife provides all the rest.

511
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:53,043
The firing would come with
embezzlement charges

512
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:56,363
and a long, protracted lawsuit,

513
00:41:56,440 --> 00:42:02,163
which would oblige the bank to foreclose
on that charming house of yours.

514
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,285
I can sell the house, Mr. Hobbs.

515
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:09,365
You may have to, when your wife,
distressed with news of your affair,

516
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:15,004
operates on someone with less
than her usual skill.

517
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:20,120
Malpractice suits are the ruin
of many good doctors.

518
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,765
Yes, yes.

519
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:25,525
That's what you'll find motivating.

520
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:28,805
You're famous for your
investigative skills.

521
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:33,561
You found the little girl in the woods
when the best detectives failed.

522
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:37,485
Too much limelight causes you to

523
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:40,450
retreat to the comfort of a column.

524
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:43,723
You're now a hack in need of a challenge.

525
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,723
Oh, you were good once.

526
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:52,046
And now you're going to have
to be good again, sir, for me.

527
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:56,245
I had a funny patient come visit me today.

528
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:57,885
Oh, yeah?

529
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:01,407
She complained of basic
rheumatoid arthritis.

530
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,604
Well, but you're a surgeon.

531
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:06,923
I know, but she insisted
she stop in to be seen.

532
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:11,805
I was surprised, because she was
only 28, and she was very beautiful.

533
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:14,765
Might I add, she could have been a model.

534
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:20,888
But anyway, so, I check her hands,
and she doesn't have arthritis.

535
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,725
What does she have?

536
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,365
Nothing.

537
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:28,841
Her hands are perfectly healthy.

538
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:35,085
- But she was in pain?
- So she claims,

539
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:37,925
but I watched her fiddle with her purse
in the waiting room

540
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,923
when I went out to get her,
and she wouldn't have been able

541
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,885
to do that with what she was describing.

542
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:46,643
Plus, when people are really in pain,
they beg me for something stronger

543
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,449
than what they can buy over the counter.

544
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:51,605
And she didn't even ask me for anything.

545
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:54,405
So, you think she was making it up?

546
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:55,965
I know she was.

547
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:58,565
Sounds like a nut.

548
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:01,530
She wasn't.

549
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:10,161
Well, I can't talk about hands anymore.

550
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,242
I need some other parts.

551
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:58,885
Who the hell is that?

552
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,689
It's no one.

553
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:34,565
Dad. Hey, Dad. Is that
an old box you're repairing?

554
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:37,962
No, you know, it's, it's a different
kind. One of these brand new ones.

555
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:40,805
Dad, how long you been
in the elevator repair union?

556
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:45,488
Yeah. When you left
South Dakota to track down...

557
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:53,165
Simon?

558
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:55,402
Jesus, fuck, Simon.

559
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:58,922
Simon, wake up.

560
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,565
Shit. Fuck, Simon.

561
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:04,041
Oh, my God.

562
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:07,323
Oh, fuck.

563
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:13,245
9-1-1. What's your emergency?

564
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:15,525
Yeah, I need an ambulance.

565
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:18,524
My husband has overdosed
on some sleeping pills.

566
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:22,645
Yeah, that's 411 East
Third Street, Apartment 12.

567
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:24,685
Please hurry. No.

568
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:27,885
No, I can't tell if he's breathing or not.

569
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:30,884
Fuck. Just send an ambulance.

570
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:32,925
Jesus, Simon.

571
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,082
Fuck. Wake up.

572
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:37,083
Simon?

573
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:39,891
Simon? Come on.

574
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,002
- Got you!
- Oh! Fuck!

575
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:44,526
- I can't believe you came!
- The fuck is wrong with you?

576
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:46,730
Holy shit.

577
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:48,644
- You were amazing.
- That is not funny.

578
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:51,445
- What are you doing?!
- This guy's fucked up.

579
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:53,124
- What are you fucking doing?
- That was incredible.

580
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:54,770
I actually called the fucking ambulance.

581
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:58,123
- Asshole.
- Baby? That was...

582
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:14,365
I'm making you a little drink.

583
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:16,405
Easy on the roofies.

584
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:19,927
You supposedly working
on your column right now?

585
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:23,405
- Column's done.
- Is it noteworthy?

586
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:27,121
Only for the fact that it might
be my most rushed one yet.

587
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:33,403
Cop shot at home with his own gun,
by his 12-year-old daughter.

588
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:35,164
Accident, of course.

589
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:38,562
They deserve better
than the time I gave them.

590
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:47,845
Look, I better tell you
I have an agenda here.

591
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:50,366
I have an agenda, too.

592
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:56,009
Maybe we can save 'em both for later.

593
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:14,242
God, I'm so going to hell.

594
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:39,644
Tell me why you have sex with me.

595
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:43,131
No.

596
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:48,725
Tell me how it's different
than with your wife.

597
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:50,125
No.

598
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:52,680
Your wife is attractive, right?

599
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:58,647
I bet you know the answer to that.

600
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:02,404
I bet I do.

601
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:06,645
- Did you go?
- Yes.

602
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:10,008
- To her office?
- Yes.

603
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:13,360
Why?

604
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:16,046
I was curious.

605
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:20,725
She knew you were lying.

606
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:23,365
- Yeah, I guess.
- It's not funny.

607
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:26,364
That was an incredibly
fucked-up thing to do.

608
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:30,965
I'm sorry.

609
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:33,361
- I didn't mean it like that.
- Well...

610
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:38,042
She's smart, Caroline.

611
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:41,405
She's very, very smart.

612
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:43,403
Smarter than me?

613
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:45,765
Yes.

614
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:47,080
How do you know?

615
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:48,685
Because nobody's is smarter than my wife.

616
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:50,842
Trust me. Believe me.

617
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:56,086
Never make contact with her again.

618
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:59,971
Ever. You understand?

619
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:05,081
Yes. I understand.

620
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:09,249
Okay.

621
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:13,565
I'm going to ask you a question now.

622
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:16,564
All right.

623
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:21,169
Is she good in bed?

624
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:24,605
Absolutely.

625
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:27,126
She loves you, and you love her?

626
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:31,082
Yes, very much. Yes.

627
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:33,481
Then how is it different?

628
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:36,643
Unless you have children,
it's hard to understand, I think.

629
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:39,005
Try me.

630
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:41,525
After you have children,

631
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:44,331
death kinda gets into it.

632
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:46,601
You know?

633
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:53,003
Somehow you become aware
you're going to die.

634
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:55,646
I didn't get that before I had kids.

635
00:51:57,360 --> 00:52:00,489
What happens if one of my kids dies?

636
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:09,007
Anyway, it all sort of gets into the sex.

637
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:12,125
It's complicated.

638
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:14,680
Have you been with her
since our last time?

639
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:17,890
Yes, last night.

640
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:22,131
Did you think of me
when you were with her?

641
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:24,801
Yes.

642
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:29,842
I mean think of me
not just 'cause you felt guilty.

643
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:34,925
- Yeah.
- I mean, you were fucking her,

644
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,285
but actually thinking about fucking me.

645
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:40,330
Yes.

646
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,205
Do you look down at your wife
when you're fucking her and think,

647
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:52,965
"I'm going to be with you until I die"?

648
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:56,051
Yes.

649
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:58,925
How do you feel about that?

650
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:07,407
It's both comforting and
terrifying at the same time.

651
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:16,526
Do you love me?

652
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,811
Ever since the first moment I saw you.

653
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:37,682
What are you thinking about?

654
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:47,090
Trying to decide if it's better to

655
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:49,846
snoop around your apartment
while you're not here...

656
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:54,045
or ask you point-blank where it is.

657
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:56,641
Where what is?

658
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:02,362
Hobbs expects me to deliver a video
he believes you're sending him.

659
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:05,489
Oh, fuck.

660
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:08,964
- What?
- Oh, God, I don't fucking believe this.

661
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:10,405
- Jesus Christ.
- What?

662
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:12,765
I wanted you to find that video for me.

663
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:13,966
What?

664
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:16,602
They've been through my whole
apartment, my computer.

665
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:17,805
They watch me everywhere.

666
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:19,365
They've been threatening me
with all kinds of things.

667
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:22,165
I don't have much time and I wanted you
to help me find that video.

668
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:23,885
Wait, you know what's on that video?

669
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:27,805
I've never watched it,
but I was there for the taping, yes.

670
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:30,804
All right, come on, don't bullshit me.

671
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:33,884
If you're not the one sending that video
to Hobbs, then who is, hmm?

672
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:38,005
I don't know. I was hoping you
could find that out, too.

673
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:42,688
Okay. Well, maybe you want to share
with me what the fuck is going on.

674
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:47,203
It's not good.
Okay, you have to understand that

675
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:51,490
Simon was always testing me. I became
like a science experiment for him.

676
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:55,205
I'm willing to do anything you ask,

677
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:57,601
as long as it doesn't
involve hurting someone,

678
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:03,005
if you are willing to do anything I ask.

679
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:05,445
Fuck you, Si. I can keep up with you.

680
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:06,567
You can?

681
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:08,401
So you accept the challenge?

682
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:10,244
Yeah.

683
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:12,368
So what do you want me to do?

684
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:23,322
I want you to be holding the hand
of someone just as they die.

685
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:29,083
Challenge accepted.

686
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:30,605
I want you to have sex...

687
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:36,608
with someone most unexpected.

688
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:45,124
Challenge accepted.

689
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,889
I'm gonna need proof.

690
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:59,124
If you're really going to play
this kind of game, it gets really...

691
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:05,285
interesting. It gets...
gets exciting, sort of.

692
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:08,325
I don't know. Maybe I'm not explaining it.

693
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:10,045
What?

694
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:12,845
So, he set off with his camera
to be with somebody

695
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:14,490
when they died in the
hospital or something,

696
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:17,645
and then I set off with mine
to have sex with someone

697
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:20,246
- "most unexpected."
- Meaning?

698
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:22,124
Meaning like a cab driver
or a woman wouldn't do,

699
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:24,645
because that's too predictable for Simon.

700
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:27,485
You know, I always had to push back.

701
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:30,803
Simon had a way of making me
want to show him everything,

702
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:33,645
just to... just to see if it was enough.

703
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:37,880
I sat down in the lobby to think.

704
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:40,685
I could go to the Mayor's
place, Gracie Mansion.

705
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:43,405
I thought of trying to get
to one of the Yankees.

706
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:46,245
And then in walked Hobbs.

707
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:50,291
I thought I recognized him from
the CNN report of his last mega-buyout,

708
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:54,291
merger, whatever, but I wasn't sure.

709
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:58,085
The bellhop confirmed he was
the billionaire media mogul Hobbs,

710
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:01,289
and, 1,000 bucks later,
he gave me his room number.

711
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:05,085
And you taped the whole thing.

712
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:08,765
Yeah, it was easy. I just had my
camera peeking out from the purse

713
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:10,524
that I left on the table.

714
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:14,323
The next morning,
Simon tears into my purse,

715
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:16,965
and he took the flash drive,
and he never let me see it.

716
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:19,441
And he never kept his end
of the bargain up, either.

717
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:22,285
And I fucking hated him for that.
I took a shower for, like, three hours

718
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:26,645
and I promised myself I would never care
what Simon thought about me ever again.

719
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:29,365
And then he saw the video and he
freaked out, and we had a big fight.

720
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:32,085
And after he died, I thought that the...

721
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:35,050
that the video would be in his
collection, and it wasn't.

722
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:39,683
Look... why me?

723
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:43,125
Come on.

724
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:45,282
You know you're perfect for this.

725
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:49,725
So, all this, between us?

726
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:55,284
This is all for me to help you
get back some video file?

727
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:01,003
Just tell me.

728
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:02,565
Yes.

729
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:11,085
- Do you forgive me?
- No. Or me.

730
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:14,004
You have to understand that
initially I asked you for help,

731
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:17,163
and then I got to know you
and I really liked you.

732
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:19,685
Porter, you've got to believe me.

733
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:21,842
Hobbs is serious about getting this video.

734
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:24,045
He's going to take
everything away from me.

735
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:26,725
You know, you're saying a lot of things,

736
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:29,525
but you're not telling me
what I need to know.

737
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:31,250
- I've told you everything.
- No.

738
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:35,843
There is a reason why Hobbs is so adamant
about getting this flashcard back,

739
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:38,241
because a guy his age would be
proud to have proof

740
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:41,642
of fucking a woman as young and
beautiful as you without paying for it.

741
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:44,285
And if Simon told you to go
have sex with somebody,

742
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:47,842
there's a reason why he got so
upset when he saw the footage.

743
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,923
So tell me the truth... now.

744
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,885
Or I'm leaving.

745
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:55,565
I've told you everything. I promise you.

746
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:57,881
I promise.

747
00:58:57,960 --> 00:58:59,405
Please help me.

748
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,604
Porter, please help.

749
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:04,444
Porter, please.

750
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:22,722
- Wren?
- Okay, okay, okay.

751
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:26,122
What can I do for your fellows
on this lovely evening, huh?

752
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:28,123
Give us the file.

753
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:30,325
- I don't have it yet.
- Are you sure about that?

754
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,482
- You just came from her apartment.
- Hey. What the fuck?

755
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:34,847
How come you're not answering your phone?

756
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:39,965
Do you want to sell to somebody else?

757
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:41,685
I don't know.

758
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:43,967
You think you can fuck with Hobbs?

759
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:08,282
Don't let us come back here tomorrow
and find it in your house, asshole.

760
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:21,762
Please. Please.

761
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:47,245
Jesus.

762
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:49,322
Oh, I'm fine.

763
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:52,643
- What the hell happened?
- I'm fine. I got jumped.

764
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:57,005
It was only a matter of time.

765
01:00:57,080 --> 01:00:58,844
It was stupid.

766
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:01,365
I didn't put my wallet away
while I was in the cab.

767
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:02,965
I got mugged.

768
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:12,123
I'm sorry.

769
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:17,809
It was only a matter of time.

770
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:23,687
You scare me when you say that.

771
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:29,170
I'm sorry.

772
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:33,846
Good morning.

773
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:37,203
You have a furious wife,
you have blood in your piss,

774
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:39,567
and you still have a column due.

775
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:41,603
But instead of doing your job,

776
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:45,002
you dig around and you find
that Simon Crowley's father,

777
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:47,731
Frank, lives in a nursing home in Queens.

778
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,764
Mr. Crowley?

779
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:59,368
I'm a friend of Caroline's.

780
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:03,608
I was hoping you could help me.

781
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:11,365
Did Simon leave with you
a video camera, a memory card?

782
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:15,001
You know, a memory card?

783
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:27,848
Mr. Crowley?

784
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:39,524
Is he okay, though?

785
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:40,725
Okay. I'm on my way.

786
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:42,484
I'm on my way.

787
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:54,401
Paging Dr. Bender.

788
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:04,922
How serious is it?

789
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:09,521
I examined the wound myself.

790
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:13,605
The bullet pathway in the muscle
will leave scar tissue,

791
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:16,645
but not going through the entire depth.

792
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:17,846
What does that mean?

793
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:22,040
It means that he will never have
the absolute contraction

794
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:24,361
in that muscle that he should have.

795
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:32,245
- Josephine?
- It hit the left patella.

796
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:35,881
She'll need surgery and rehab.
It'll take at least a year.

797
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:47,244
What the fuck happened?

798
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:02,803
What happened?

799
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:06,846
She rode with the kids in the ambulance.

800
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:12,365
But the cop who was trying to get the story
said that she was pretty incoherent,

801
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:16,405
just that a man forced his way
into the house with a gun

802
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:18,926
and was searching for something.

803
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:22,123
You know who the man was?

804
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:26,723
I have a good idea.

805
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:34,963
I will not let my children
be a part of this, Porter.

806
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:36,929
- No.
- Daddy?

807
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:42,005
Sally-bird. Don't cry, sweetheart.

808
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:44,525
Come here. Oh, Sally-bird.

809
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:46,443
Everything's going to be all right.

810
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:49,405
- How did I get here?
- No, sweetheart, you're okay.

811
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:52,285
I'll tell you later.

812
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:53,850
I'm taking the kids to my mother's.

813
01:05:53,960 --> 01:05:55,962
Sit up, baby.

814
01:05:57,800 --> 01:05:59,040
What about his arm?

815
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:02,165
They need this room. He's free to go.

816
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:04,561
He can travel. I'll take good care of him.

817
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:05,925
Here, you be careful
with this thing, okay?

818
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,162
Daddy, are you coming to Grandma's?

819
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:09,605
Such a good boy.

820
01:06:10,520 --> 01:06:12,565
Not on this trip, sweetie.

821
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:14,085
Why?

822
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:18,165
- Come on, baby.
- Let me walk you to the street.

823
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:19,565
I would rather you didn't.

824
01:06:19,640 --> 01:06:22,041
I don't know if I'll be able to
contain my rage that long.

825
01:06:22,120 --> 01:06:23,884
Come on, sweetheart.

826
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:40,929
When your little boy has been even
grazed by a bullet, all bets are off.

827
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:47,084
I needed to get to Hobbs.
And I knew that the only way

828
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:49,765
was through his gatekeeper, Campbell.

829
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:53,526
I was now past being afraid of
what my desperation could do.

830
01:06:54,080 --> 01:06:55,525
Open the other door.

831
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:59,002
- Take my wallet!
- Shut up. Get inside.

832
01:06:59,080 --> 01:07:00,844
Get inside.

833
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:04,640
- Oh, God!
- Move!

834
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:07,121
Don't kill me, please.

835
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:10,285
Do you know who I am?

836
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:12,085
- No.
- I'm Wren.

837
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:14,083
Porter Wren.

838
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:17,801
Your goons shot my little boy
this afternoon, did you know that?

839
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:19,609
Yeah.

840
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:23,885
Which drawer has the sharpest knives?

841
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:25,325
Oh, God, no, please.

842
01:07:26,120 --> 01:07:27,531
Which drawer?

843
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:36,605
Now, call Hobbs.

844
01:07:36,680 --> 01:07:38,405
I can't. He's in London.

845
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:39,481
No...

846
01:07:39,560 --> 01:07:42,605
No, we're going to tell him
to call off his goons.

847
01:07:42,680 --> 01:07:44,762
He's unavailable. I swear.

848
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:51,126
Start thinking, Campbell.

849
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:55,325
My son is three years old.

850
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:57,445
He is a perfect angel. He's innocent.

851
01:07:57,520 --> 01:08:00,000
All right! Wait, wait, wait, wait.

852
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:08,523
0-11-44-955-646-7287.

853
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:13,405
Hobbs?

854
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:15,525
- Campbell?
- So sorry to wake you.

855
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:18,126
Hobbs, this is Porter Wren.

856
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:20,603
One of your goons
broke into my house today

857
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:23,285
and shot my three-year-old son
and his babysitter.

858
01:08:23,360 --> 01:08:26,443
You listen to me, you motherfucker.

859
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:30,681
If you do not call off your goons,
I will make 1,000 copies of that video

860
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:34,885
and I will send one to every newspaper,
every television station in the world.

861
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:36,883
I will be a fucking wild man.

862
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:38,564
I don't care. I don't give a shit.

863
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:41,405
I will go down in a glorious ball of fire,

864
01:08:41,480 --> 01:08:44,484
and I will take you with me, you fat fuck.

865
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:47,564
Now you call off your goons right now.

866
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:52,085
You have a 24-hour grace period,
Mr. Wren. How about that?

867
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:56,365
Fail to hand me the master video when
I'm back in New York tomorrow evening,

868
01:08:56,440 --> 01:08:59,565
and your troubles today
will be longed for fondly

869
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:03,247
compared to the realm
you will find yourself in.

870
01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:49,442
I don't know how
he got up there, but he did.

871
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:51,602
- You're funny.
- Okay, Daddy? Dad?

872
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:55,965
Daddy? Tell me again how to make
the elevator run from the remote.

873
01:09:56,040 --> 01:09:59,601
Out of the key paid
in the back of the panel.

874
01:09:59,680 --> 01:10:01,125
Some dessert, Frank?

875
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:03,245
I know, the quick
patch or the boot patch, or...?

876
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:06,369
Boot patch. You need a boot patch
to complete the circuit.

877
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:10,604
The camera annoys me.

878
01:10:10,680 --> 01:10:11,725
What? What's the matter?

879
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:13,125
Frank doesn't like the camera.

880
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:15,845
I know. Well, I got...
I'm going to go away tonight

881
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:19,525
for a little while, Dad, and I want you
on the camera, okay?

882
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:21,965
Okay, I'm going to go. I have to go.

883
01:10:22,040 --> 01:10:24,042
I have to pick up some medicines for Irv.

884
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:25,884
Mrs. Segal, I need to get a key made.

885
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:28,361
Can I get a ride with you to
the hardware store?

886
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:31,085
- Well, of course you can.
- Thank you.

887
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:34,243
Dad? Dad. I'm going to say
goodbye now, okay?

888
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:36,163
Okay.

889
01:10:36,240 --> 01:10:37,965
- Me, too.
- Bye.

890
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:40,520
- Okay.
- Mrs. Segal?

891
01:10:42,240 --> 01:10:46,085
Would you mind if...
we had, you know, a minute?

892
01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:48,003
Father/son moment?

893
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:49,844
Thank you.

894
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:55,485
- Say goodbye. Say goodbye.
- Yeah, I... I said.

895
01:10:55,560 --> 01:10:56,641
Okay.

896
01:10:58,760 --> 01:11:00,364
Daddy?

897
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:04,845
Here's what I want you to know.
I want you to know that I never

898
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:06,684
blamed you for what happened...

899
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:09,081
for what happened to Mom, okay?

900
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:13,171
And no matter what happens now,

901
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:16,523
or tonight, I don't want you
to blame yourself.

902
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:18,602
Okay?

903
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:24,401
And you watch this as many times
as you need...

904
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:29,561
until you accept
that that's the truth, okay?

905
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:34,329
I love you, Daddy.

906
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:38,281
All right. Okay.

907
01:11:52,160 --> 01:11:54,970
Mrs. Segal in the video
had to be Norma Segal,

908
01:11:55,080 --> 01:11:58,605
a name I had noticed in
the nursing home guest book.

909
01:11:58,680 --> 01:12:01,725
She visited Frank Crowley
twice every week.

910
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:04,405
I tracked her down
to an address in Queens.

911
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:07,125
And, like Frank Crowley,
I was running out of time.

912
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:08,645
And she was all I had.

913
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:36,121
Hello?

914
01:12:41,560 --> 01:12:43,289
Hello?

915
01:15:08,760 --> 01:15:10,728
Oh, my God, get out!

916
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:13,805
Get out. Get out. I'm calling the police.

917
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:15,644
- Please don't. No.
- I'm calling the police.

918
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:17,882
- No, please.
- No, don't touch it. No!

919
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:19,685
- Get out! Get out!
- Here.

920
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:21,485
Please don't hurt me. Just please go.

921
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:23,765
Mrs. Segal, I'm desperate.

922
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:26,161
Please, I'm sorry I entered
your house without permission,

923
01:15:26,240 --> 01:15:28,685
but... I know it's wrong.

924
01:15:28,760 --> 01:15:30,485
I need your help, Mrs. Segal. Please.

925
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:32,045
You know me? How do you know me?

926
01:15:32,120 --> 01:15:34,726
- Do I know you?
- I'm Porter Wren.

927
01:15:34,840 --> 01:15:36,330
I'm a...

928
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:40,046
I write a column in the paper.

929
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:46,165
I'm risking my whole career,
telling you who I am.

930
01:15:46,240 --> 01:15:48,288
And please, trust me.

931
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:54,805
I read you all the time.

932
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:56,605
I'm not here for the paper.

933
01:15:56,680 --> 01:15:58,523
I promise I won't,
I won't write about this.

934
01:15:58,600 --> 01:15:59,647
I'm...

935
01:16:00,760 --> 01:16:02,603
I'm trying to help Caroline.

936
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:07,244
Now if you could just answer
a few questions for me,

937
01:16:07,320 --> 01:16:09,525
I'd be incredibly grateful. Okay?

938
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:14,083
- Okay.
- Now, Simon was a family friend?

939
01:16:14,160 --> 01:16:17,960
Yes. Simon was best friends
with our Michael growing up,

940
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:19,525
- when they were little.
- Oh, yeah?

941
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:21,523
They remained friends?

942
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:24,490
Michael drowned when he was eight.

943
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:28,644
Simon still came over
every day after school,

944
01:16:28,720 --> 01:16:33,085
because Frank was working and Simon's
mother had passed away already.

945
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:37,051
He became like a replacement son
for us, you could say.

946
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:42,084
Now, you were visiting
Frank Crowley, Simon's dad,

947
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:45,805
and billing the estate, right?

948
01:16:45,880 --> 01:16:51,245
Yes. Simon had his firm
send us $2,000 a month,

949
01:16:51,320 --> 01:16:53,605
once he started making money,

950
01:16:53,680 --> 01:16:56,285
because he wanted to take care of us.

951
01:16:56,360 --> 01:16:57,964
I was very uncomfortable with it.

952
01:16:58,040 --> 01:16:59,765
I thought, I thought we
should earn the money.

953
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:05,244
So, I was visiting Frank twice
a week at the home.

954
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:09,371
Frank and I've become close
over the years.

955
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:13,885
So, I started billing the firm

956
01:17:13,960 --> 01:17:18,204
for those visits by sending invoices
on Irv's legal stationery.

957
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:23,404
Would you... Would you like to sit,

958
01:17:23,480 --> 01:17:25,323
and... and go downstairs?

959
01:17:26,840 --> 01:17:28,365
Sure.

960
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:31,245
- Sorry.
- That was very scary.

961
01:17:31,320 --> 01:17:32,890
- I'm really sorry.
- Yeah.

962
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:36,685
Now, what about
those other $5,000 payments?

963
01:17:36,760 --> 01:17:39,325
Oh, that was something different.

964
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:44,964
Simon said he had a job for me,
for which he would pay $5,000.

965
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:48,925
He told me to bill the firm,
to send something to a third party.

966
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:53,765
He said to write the invoice
on legal letterhead like I had before.

967
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:57,003
Was it a camera memory card?

968
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:01,041
Yes, it was a video camera card.

969
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:04,805
He gave me this whole box of
little plastic things.

970
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:08,601
I don't know what was on it.
I didn't look at it.

971
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:10,725
Simon told me, if we needed cash,

972
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:14,122
follow the same instructions,
mail one of them,

973
01:18:14,200 --> 01:18:17,283
and bill the firm. It was remarkable.

974
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:20,202
Remarkable.

975
01:18:20,280 --> 01:18:22,362
Mrs. Segal, I need that box of copies.

976
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:25,762
Oh, no, no. Simon made me promise
not to give it to anyone.

977
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:27,569
No, no, you keep billing the firm.

978
01:18:27,720 --> 01:18:30,610
You just... You can't send them anymore.

979
01:18:30,720 --> 01:18:32,365
Really?

980
01:18:32,440 --> 01:18:37,403
Because I'm down to my last one,
and I was wondering how to make more.

981
01:18:38,720 --> 01:18:40,882
I need that video card.

982
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:45,765
Such a small, little thing.

983
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:48,810
I have no idea what could be on it.

984
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:54,764
I'm much heavier than I should be.

985
01:18:54,840 --> 01:19:00,882
And I'm quite incapable of
normal sexual function.

986
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:02,365
Can't have sex?

987
01:19:02,440 --> 01:19:04,761
There are other things in life.

988
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:06,365
There's something that
you're not telling me.

989
01:19:06,440 --> 01:19:10,764
- Well...
- Well, don't be embarrassed.

990
01:19:10,840 --> 01:19:12,565
You can tell me anything,

991
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:16,725
and I can take whatever it is
and keep it locked up.

992
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:18,765
Well...

993
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:24,685
Well, it happened a very...
a very long time ago.

994
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:27,604
Too long to keep inside of yourself?

995
01:19:27,680 --> 01:19:31,924
It was summer, before my final
year at university,

996
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:35,205
and I decided to work on a freighter.

997
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:40,045
I was the son of one of
the richest men in Australia.

998
01:19:40,120 --> 01:19:43,885
I took the job just to spite my old man.

999
01:19:43,960 --> 01:19:47,485
Anyway, we had a week's shore
leave in Marseilles.

1000
01:19:47,560 --> 01:19:51,005
Something tells me there's a
woman involved in this story.

1001
01:19:51,080 --> 01:19:52,885
As beautiful as you are.

1002
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:56,760
She was the most expensive
prostitute in Marseilles,

1003
01:19:56,840 --> 01:20:01,641
and I... I did something
stupendously stupid.

1004
01:20:01,720 --> 01:20:04,165
And what is that?

1005
01:20:04,240 --> 01:20:06,447
Well, I fell in love with her.

1006
01:20:08,440 --> 01:20:10,124
And I gave her my last franc

1007
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:16,964
just to be able to look into her
eyes for a few minutes longer.

1008
01:20:17,080 --> 01:20:20,045
It broke me up to say goodbye.

1009
01:20:20,120 --> 01:20:22,600
I kissed her,

1010
01:20:22,680 --> 01:20:24,603
told her I loved her,

1011
01:20:24,680 --> 01:20:29,083
and flew down those dark
streets to the port.

1012
01:20:29,160 --> 01:20:34,041
Suddenly, some of the regular
Marseille sailors

1013
01:20:34,120 --> 01:20:38,523
caught up with me
and beat me up, pretty badly.

1014
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:42,321
One of them stuck me
with a knife, in the groin,

1015
01:20:42,440 --> 01:20:45,205
at least... at least a dozen times.

1016
01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:48,645
And they... and they left me for dead.

1017
01:20:48,720 --> 01:20:50,802
Oh, my God.

1018
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:54,645
Well, my manhood was severely wounded.

1019
01:20:54,720 --> 01:20:57,644
I... in fact...

1020
01:20:59,080 --> 01:21:00,241
In fact...

1021
01:21:01,640 --> 01:21:02,846
I was butchered.

1022
01:21:06,120 --> 01:21:10,205
Well, I went to the best doctors
in the world, but some things...

1023
01:21:10,280 --> 01:21:13,204
Well, some things, you can't fix.

1024
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,480
And I was 20-years-old.

1025
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:23,725
May I see?

1026
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:27,485
Good God, it's far too embarrassing.

1027
01:21:27,560 --> 01:21:28,891
Please.

1028
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:31,401
Show me.

1029
01:21:33,560 --> 01:21:35,085
Show me.

1030
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:04,883
You're not repulsed by me?

1031
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:06,724
No.

1032
01:22:11,480 --> 01:22:13,323
I think you're sweet.

1033
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:24,886
I'd like to tell you a story now
that I've never told anyone before.

1034
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:29,130
It's about when I was a little girl
and I really wanted a horse.

1035
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:35,085
And every day, I would ask
my stepfather for this horse.

1036
01:22:35,160 --> 01:22:38,004
I used to beg him, so much...

1037
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:52,081
Good God.

1038
01:22:56,960 --> 01:22:58,769
That's terrible.

1039
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:09,409
I want... I want to do something...

1040
01:23:12,720 --> 01:23:14,643
for you.

1041
01:23:14,760 --> 01:23:20,365
I'd like... so very much...

1042
01:23:20,440 --> 01:23:22,681
to kiss you...

1043
01:23:23,720 --> 01:23:28,886
in... a special place.

1044
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:36,445
Am I...

1045
01:23:36,520 --> 01:23:38,807
Am I allowed...

1046
01:23:40,200 --> 01:23:41,804
to do that?

1047
01:23:41,880 --> 01:23:43,685
I don't mind if you say no.

1048
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:45,603
You're allowed.

1049
01:23:45,680 --> 01:23:47,645
You sure?

1050
01:23:47,720 --> 01:23:49,529
Yes.

1051
01:24:37,960 --> 01:24:39,485
Oh, my God.

1052
01:25:14,160 --> 01:25:15,685
Mr. Wren.

1053
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:19,321
Can we behave like gentlemen this time?

1054
01:25:19,400 --> 01:25:22,609
I'm much heavier than I should be.

1055
01:25:22,720 --> 01:25:27,442
And I'm quite incapable of normal sex...

1056
01:25:29,280 --> 01:25:32,245
Oh, I'd like to ask you three questions.

1057
01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:33,645
Shoot.

1058
01:25:33,720 --> 01:25:37,565
Was Miss Crowley sending
these video cards?

1059
01:25:37,640 --> 01:25:40,803
- No.
- Then who was?

1060
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:46,046
An innocent woman, taking orders
from Simon Crowley.

1061
01:25:46,160 --> 01:25:48,605
Did she watch the contents?

1062
01:25:48,680 --> 01:25:50,485
- No.
- Did you?

1063
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:52,403
That's four questions.

1064
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:54,605
Please indulge me.

1065
01:25:54,680 --> 01:25:58,048
And I'll, I'll share something with you.

1066
01:26:00,520 --> 01:26:02,841
Yes, I watched the video.

1067
01:26:02,920 --> 01:26:06,561
Aren't I a lovely sight?

1068
01:26:08,360 --> 01:26:12,001
I've been holding onto
this for a long time.

1069
01:26:12,080 --> 01:26:17,165
And in the spirit of
"all's well that ends well,"

1070
01:26:17,240 --> 01:26:20,365
I'd like to... to give it to you.

1071
01:26:20,440 --> 01:26:23,364
We did gain access
to Ms. Crowley's apartment,

1072
01:26:23,440 --> 01:26:26,603
and I am sure she suspects something.

1073
01:26:26,680 --> 01:26:29,565
- She does.
- We were looking for the video.

1074
01:26:29,640 --> 01:26:32,120
And we looked at all her keys,

1075
01:26:32,200 --> 01:26:37,809
and we identified every one,
except that one.

1076
01:26:39,640 --> 01:26:41,845
I could've left it there, walked away,

1077
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:44,321
tried to put my life back together.

1078
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:47,404
But there were still too many
questions about Simon's death.

1079
01:26:47,480 --> 01:26:51,963
And the truth is this key could
unlock the secrets of Caroline.

1080
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:54,805
She was a mystery I could not
walk away from.

1081
01:27:57,040 --> 01:27:58,565
Can I help you?

1082
01:27:58,640 --> 01:28:00,285
Hey. It's Porter.

1083
01:28:00,360 --> 01:28:05,445
Back in the day, I used to
deliver coal to both buildings,

1084
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:08,091
through this basement.

1085
01:28:10,720 --> 01:28:14,845
The one next door that they demolished
was identical to my building.

1086
01:28:14,920 --> 01:28:19,084
You see, both buildings are
exactly the same.

1087
01:28:26,360 --> 01:28:28,885
Does the demolition crew
inspect the elevator

1088
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:31,485
before they send it to the basement?

1089
01:28:31,560 --> 01:28:34,723
The one next door was already in
the basement, didn't need to be dropped.

1090
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:37,165
And the cops who
investigated Crowley's death,

1091
01:28:37,240 --> 01:28:40,445
they couldn't search
the elevator, could they?

1092
01:28:40,520 --> 01:28:43,085
Because it was under 20 feet of rubble.

1093
01:28:43,160 --> 01:28:46,045
What would they be looking for?

1094
01:28:46,120 --> 01:28:48,441
It's just an elevator.

1095
01:29:39,600 --> 01:29:41,364
Yo! Throw the rope!

1096
01:31:51,960 --> 01:31:53,405
- What?
- Feel that?

1097
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:17,121
Why have you been buying milk lately?

1098
01:32:17,200 --> 01:32:20,090
They're going to demolish this
tomorrow morning.

1099
01:32:21,720 --> 01:32:23,845
Well, can we make it quick?

1100
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:25,763
It's creepy in here.

1101
01:33:03,240 --> 01:33:04,651
All right?

1102
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:08,763
Yeah. You know, I'm going
to wait downstairs.

1103
01:33:08,840 --> 01:33:10,842
- This is too weird.
- Here.

1104
01:33:10,920 --> 01:33:14,641
Caroline? Come talk to me.

1105
01:33:14,720 --> 01:33:17,963
Why is this elevator not working?
I want to go downstairs.

1106
01:33:18,040 --> 01:33:19,804
Hey, come. Come talk to me.
I'm your husband.

1107
01:33:21,920 --> 01:33:23,763
Come talk to us.

1108
01:33:40,920 --> 01:33:42,805
Why do you have my horse?

1109
01:33:42,880 --> 01:33:46,845
It's an item of marital interest,
wouldn't you say?

1110
01:33:46,920 --> 01:33:49,885
This old treasure
is about 1,000 years old.

1111
01:33:49,960 --> 01:33:51,925
Your phone's not gonna work, baby.
I took out the SIM card at home

1112
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:53,365
and put it under your pillow.

1113
01:33:53,480 --> 01:33:57,883
It's made of jade, from the Zhang Dynasty.

1114
01:33:57,960 --> 01:34:03,325
And it's worth about
$1.8 million, I found out.

1115
01:34:03,400 --> 01:34:06,643
So, obviously, Mr. Hobbs appreciates you.

1116
01:34:06,720 --> 01:34:09,485
He appreciated you with
his tongue, we know that.

1117
01:34:09,560 --> 01:34:14,441
He appreciates your little horse
story that you told him,

1118
01:34:14,520 --> 01:34:16,921
to give you a gift like this.

1119
01:34:18,640 --> 01:34:20,688
Made you feel like you have a real daddy?

1120
01:34:20,800 --> 01:34:23,451
Made you feel safe, Car?

1121
01:34:26,080 --> 01:34:28,208
Tell me the story.

1122
01:34:30,120 --> 01:34:32,361
I'm not telling you the story.

1123
01:34:32,440 --> 01:34:33,885
- It's locked.
- We're leaving.

1124
01:34:33,960 --> 01:34:37,567
No, we're here.
All the doors are locked, babe.

1125
01:34:39,080 --> 01:34:40,525
Fuck.

1126
01:34:41,680 --> 01:34:46,330
We are not leaving until you tell me the
story, exactly the way you told it to him.

1127
01:34:52,560 --> 01:34:54,285
Okay.

1128
01:34:54,360 --> 01:34:58,524
Well... I guess we'll stay the night.

1129
01:34:58,600 --> 01:35:01,805
Seriously. I am prepared
to wait all night.

1130
01:35:01,880 --> 01:35:03,325
I have my milk.

1131
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:09,881
And if you have not told me
the story by the morning,

1132
01:35:09,960 --> 01:35:13,325
we can be demolished
along with this building,

1133
01:35:13,400 --> 01:35:16,609
and our bodies can be
crushed by the rubble,

1134
01:35:16,720 --> 01:35:19,485
and we'll be compressed into dust.

1135
01:35:19,960 --> 01:35:23,005
I'm never telling you
that fucking story, okay?

1136
01:35:23,080 --> 01:35:24,730
Ever.

1137
01:35:32,720 --> 01:35:35,285
Jesus, what the fuck are you doing?

1138
01:35:35,360 --> 01:35:38,085
Well, I'm breaking the expensive horse.

1139
01:35:38,160 --> 01:35:40,811
This key will bring the elevator back.

1140
01:35:40,920 --> 01:35:42,206
So...

1141
01:35:43,240 --> 01:35:44,645
- Give me the key.
- Give me the story.

1142
01:35:44,720 --> 01:35:47,041
No. Just give me the key, Simon.

1143
01:35:55,040 --> 01:35:57,008
Actually, that's, um,
that's our postal box key.

1144
01:35:58,920 --> 01:36:02,527
This key is the one that unlocks
the padlock around your ankle.

1145
01:36:10,640 --> 01:36:12,324
How about that story now?

1146
01:36:13,880 --> 01:36:16,770
- I fucking hate you.
- I fucking love you.

1147
01:36:19,240 --> 01:36:20,844
The more you resist,
the harder it's going to be.

1148
01:36:20,960 --> 01:36:22,644
So, tell me the story.

1149
01:36:23,840 --> 01:36:24,841
No?

1150
01:36:27,680 --> 01:36:29,603
No?

1151
01:36:29,720 --> 01:36:33,202
Okay, 'cause of that, I'm going
to have to drink my milk here.

1152
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:36,887
I've been practicing drinking milk.

1153
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:41,281
It'll help me swallow keys.

1154
01:36:43,400 --> 01:36:44,561
Son of a bitch.

1155
01:36:44,640 --> 01:36:46,688
Don't swallow the key.

1156
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:49,167
Please don't. Please. Please stop.

1157
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,445
So now you control your fate.

1158
01:37:09,520 --> 01:37:12,245
Tell me the story, so I won't
send the elevator down,

1159
01:37:12,320 --> 01:37:15,365
because, if I send it down
to the basement,

1160
01:37:15,440 --> 01:37:17,805
there's no way for it to be down
there and you to still be here.

1161
01:37:17,880 --> 01:37:20,360
I'm not telling you the story.
Just stop this, please.

1162
01:37:20,480 --> 01:37:23,370
Last chance. I'll start it for you.

1163
01:37:23,480 --> 01:37:25,525
When I was a little girl...

1164
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:28,001
- Please don't.
- I really wanted a horse.

1165
01:37:28,080 --> 01:37:30,605
Just tell the story and I won't
push this button, okay?

1166
01:37:30,680 --> 01:37:32,682
I don't want to tell the story.

1167
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:39,805
No. Stop.

1168
01:37:39,880 --> 01:37:42,245
Shit, Simon, fuck.

1169
01:37:42,320 --> 01:37:43,765
Is your pathetic story really worth this?

1170
01:37:43,840 --> 01:37:48,525
No. No, please, stop. Stop the elevator.

1171
01:37:48,600 --> 01:37:50,523
Tell me the fucking story!

1172
01:37:50,600 --> 01:37:53,285
Why aren't you trying to stop this thing?

1173
01:37:53,360 --> 01:37:56,921
Okay. When I was a little girl,
I really wanted a horse.

1174
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,885
- Okay.
- I begged my stepdad for one every day.

1175
01:37:59,960 --> 01:38:04,249
- Fucking stop.
- Too late. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

1176
01:38:11,200 --> 01:38:12,245
Hi. Okay.

1177
01:38:12,320 --> 01:38:14,525
So, I rigged it to stop.

1178
01:38:14,600 --> 01:38:17,604
I thought for sure you would
tell me sooner.

1179
01:38:23,160 --> 01:38:29,691
Anyway, so, yes. "My stepdad,
every day, I asked him," and?

1180
01:38:42,840 --> 01:38:44,001
Jesus.

1181
01:38:53,960 --> 01:38:55,564
Oh, God.

1182
01:39:18,080 --> 01:39:19,725
Simon?

1183
01:39:19,800 --> 01:39:21,006
Please...

1184
01:40:31,760 --> 01:40:33,045
Hello.

1185
01:40:33,120 --> 01:40:35,005
Please tell me
that you found the Hobbs tape

1186
01:40:35,080 --> 01:40:37,003
- and that you returned it.
- I did.

1187
01:40:37,080 --> 01:40:39,205
What? You did, really?

1188
01:40:39,280 --> 01:40:42,325
- Where was it?
- I'm sorry. I can't talk now.

1189
01:40:42,400 --> 01:40:44,721
Well, can we have breakfast?

1190
01:40:44,800 --> 01:40:46,325
I'd like that.

1191
01:40:53,920 --> 01:40:55,285
- Hi.
- Hi.

1192
01:40:58,640 --> 01:41:00,688
Have you been rolling around in the mud?

1193
01:41:02,400 --> 01:41:03,925
It's a long story.

1194
01:41:04,040 --> 01:41:06,645
Well, I like long stories.

1195
01:41:06,720 --> 01:41:08,685
Before you tell me everything,

1196
01:41:08,760 --> 01:41:11,889
there is something
that I would like to show you.

1197
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:19,081
Congratulations.

1198
01:41:20,880 --> 01:41:22,245
Thank you.

1199
01:41:22,320 --> 01:41:25,767
I've got some things to show you, too.

1200
01:41:32,960 --> 01:41:35,167
It's beautiful.

1201
01:41:36,360 --> 01:41:37,725
What is it?

1202
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:43,565
Don't lie to me now, Caroline.

1203
01:41:48,120 --> 01:41:51,124
Simon threw it and broke it.

1204
01:41:54,200 --> 01:41:55,804
Yes.

1205
01:41:58,600 --> 01:42:01,285
You used the padlock from your ankle

1206
01:42:01,360 --> 01:42:04,405
to lock the basement door
so no one would find the body.

1207
01:42:04,480 --> 01:42:06,125
Porter...

1208
01:42:06,200 --> 01:42:07,281
Did you know...

1209
01:42:09,680 --> 01:42:11,523
it was all on camera?

1210
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:14,684
Every second.

1211
01:42:16,400 --> 01:42:19,244
Moment by moment.

1212
01:42:27,320 --> 01:42:29,402
This is a copy for you.

1213
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:36,561
The original is somewhere
you will never find.

1214
01:42:36,640 --> 01:42:39,445
If you ever contact my wife in any way...

1215
01:42:39,520 --> 01:42:41,443
I see.

1216
01:42:43,080 --> 01:42:45,003
Keep me in check.

1217
01:42:49,320 --> 01:42:51,243
Will you tell it to me?

1218
01:42:54,480 --> 01:42:56,244
The horse story?

1219
01:43:01,760 --> 01:43:05,560
When I was nine, I really wanted a horse.

1220
01:43:07,760 --> 01:43:10,645
And my stepfather, Ron,

1221
01:43:10,720 --> 01:43:13,724
was not into giving me one.

1222
01:43:16,320 --> 01:43:19,244
And my mother was so powerless
in the relationship

1223
01:43:19,320 --> 01:43:23,291
that she didn't even bother
to argue for me.

1224
01:43:28,760 --> 01:43:31,764
As my birthday got closer, I used to beg

1225
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:35,365
and beg for that horse.

1226
01:43:35,440 --> 01:43:38,489
And every time I begged, Ron
would slap me across the face.

1227
01:43:40,080 --> 01:43:43,129
It would only make me
beg more the next day.

1228
01:43:47,600 --> 01:43:49,090
One night he came into my room
and he said,

1229
01:43:49,240 --> 01:43:51,846
if I could keep his visit a secret...

1230
01:43:53,320 --> 01:43:56,205
and if he could do whatever he wanted,

1231
01:43:56,280 --> 01:43:59,489
then he would buy me
a horse for my birthday.

1232
01:44:02,960 --> 01:44:05,281
And this went on for about a week.

1233
01:44:07,160 --> 01:44:12,041
And when my birthday rolled
around, there was no horse.

1234
01:44:12,120 --> 01:44:14,325
So, that night, when he came into my room,

1235
01:44:14,400 --> 01:44:18,566
I told him that I was going to go tell
my mother what he had been doing to me.

1236
01:44:20,880 --> 01:44:25,886
And he promised me that
he'd kept his end of the deal...

1237
01:44:28,960 --> 01:44:32,407
and that there would be a horse
waiting for me the next day.

1238
01:45:01,600 --> 01:45:06,561
Happy birthday, Caroline.
Here's your horse.

1239
01:45:32,320 --> 01:45:35,205
Why did you look in the elevator?

1240
01:45:35,280 --> 01:45:38,363
I think you wanted me to, Caroline.

1241
01:45:41,800 --> 01:45:43,723
Goodbye, Caroline.

1242
01:45:46,640 --> 01:45:48,125
Well, don't just go.

1243
01:45:48,200 --> 01:45:50,441
Say something to me.

1244
01:45:53,360 --> 01:45:55,010
Be well.

1245
01:45:56,920 --> 01:45:59,491
As well as you can be.

1246
01:46:14,360 --> 01:46:17,045
The ugliness of who
I've been and who I am now

1247
01:46:17,120 --> 01:46:21,444
is strongest when I get to see
my wife and children.

1248
01:46:21,560 --> 01:46:24,285
I never told Lisa the truth,

1249
01:46:24,360 --> 01:46:28,081
choosing instead to let her
imagine the worst of me.

1250
01:46:28,160 --> 01:46:31,084
I think she decided that
whatever was in me now

1251
01:46:31,160 --> 01:46:34,925
was dark and ugly
and better left where it was,

1252
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:38,209
as long as it was not near her
or the kids.

1253
01:46:45,840 --> 01:46:47,885
What was I doing here?

1254
01:46:47,960 --> 01:46:50,565
Maybe because it made me feel safer

1255
01:46:50,640 --> 01:46:53,610
to know Caroline was far away from me,

1256
01:46:54,920 --> 01:46:59,164
as if I alone were not responsible
for the wreckage to my marriage.

1257
01:47:01,320 --> 01:47:05,611
Maybe to see her in a new life
would bring me some kind of closure.

1258
01:47:07,720 --> 01:47:12,324
Maybe I'm just feeling stupidly
sentimental, like the asshole that I am.

1259
01:47:22,600 --> 01:47:25,763
As the old reporter told me
on my first day,

1260
01:47:25,840 --> 01:47:28,764
"It's all one story, kid.

1261
01:47:31,200 --> 01:47:33,202
It's all one big story."
