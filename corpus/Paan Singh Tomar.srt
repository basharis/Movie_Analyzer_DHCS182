26
00:02:54,754 --> 00:02:56,381
You know, Paan Singh killed...

27
00:02:56,456 --> 00:02:58,617
nine Gujjars in broad daylight.

28
00:02:58,692 --> 00:03:00,626
He was avenging his brother's death.

29
00:03:00,694 --> 00:03:02,491
And the cops are completely helpless now.

30
00:03:02,596 --> 00:03:03,792
What can the cops do anyway?

31
00:03:03,793 --> 00:03:04,860
If the cops are east...

32
00:03:04,931 --> 00:03:06,728
then Paan Singh is west.

33
00:03:06,933 --> 00:03:09,265
They say that he used to be in the Army.

34
00:03:14,407 --> 00:03:16,432
Hey, give me a cigarette...

35
00:03:19,779 --> 00:03:20,871
The entire packet.

36
00:03:24,985 --> 00:03:26,247
Here's, your money.

37
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,581
There's some hanky-panky going on!

38
00:03:29,656 --> 00:03:31,681
You look pretty pleased.

39
00:03:32,425 --> 00:03:33,892
You ain't seen nothing yet!

40
00:03:34,694 --> 00:03:36,252
Look out for my photo on the first page of the newspaper.

41
00:03:36,363 --> 00:03:37,853
If it is not printed...

42
00:03:37,931 --> 00:03:39,455
then I'll eat the food you feed your dogs.

43
00:03:39,566 --> 00:03:40,533
Why?

44
00:03:40,634 --> 00:03:42,568
Have you joined Paan Singh's gang?

45
00:03:42,669 --> 00:03:44,002
How do you know this?

46
00:03:44,003 --> 00:03:45,399
Keep it to yourself!

47
00:03:58,385 --> 00:04:00,683
- The guy wearing the blue shirt?
- Yes.

48
00:04:02,322 --> 00:04:03,448
Yes?

49
00:04:03,757 --> 00:04:04,849
Greetings.

50
00:04:06,226 --> 00:04:07,318
Is he the journalist?

51
00:04:07,427 --> 00:04:08,257
Yes.

52
00:04:08,328 --> 00:04:10,228
I hope he won't squeal.

53
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:11,422
Not at all.

54
00:04:11,965 --> 00:04:13,489
He's an army man.

55
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,465
He is very particular about punctuality.

56
00:04:15,569 --> 00:04:16,763
Absolutely.

57
00:04:20,407 --> 00:04:23,740
Till the task is completed the girl stays with us.

58
00:04:25,745 --> 00:04:26,973
My dear...

59
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,139
stay here with uncle...

60
00:04:29,249 --> 00:04:30,648
just for a little while.

61
00:04:30,717 --> 00:04:32,048
He'll give you sweets.

62
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:33,911
You'll get your favourite sweet!

63
00:04:35,822 --> 00:04:37,949
He'll also show you your favourite movie.

64
00:04:38,024 --> 00:04:38,991
Is that okay?

65
00:04:39,059 --> 00:04:40,253
Please look after her.

66
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,349
Excuse me...

67
00:04:41,428 --> 00:04:42,486
hold on...

68
00:04:43,229 --> 00:04:45,959
Please keep this with you and take care of her.

69
00:04:46,766 --> 00:04:47,858
Let's go?

70
00:04:48,602 --> 00:04:49,967
Is my sister safe here?

71
00:04:50,036 --> 00:04:51,731
That depends on you.

72
00:05:20,367 --> 00:05:21,595
Come on.

73
00:05:24,004 --> 00:05:25,198
Come...

74
00:05:25,505 --> 00:05:27,496
The journalist is here, Subedaar.

75
00:05:27,607 --> 00:05:29,404
I've frisked him.

76
00:05:29,509 --> 00:05:30,874
Listen, brother...

77
00:05:31,411 --> 00:05:32,969
How do I address him?

78
00:05:33,346 --> 00:05:34,677
Does 'sir' sound fine?

79
00:05:35,181 --> 00:05:36,307
Or...

80
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,179
S... S... S...

81
00:05:37,283 --> 00:05:38,409
Subedaar?

82
00:06:00,073 --> 00:06:02,064
Thank you, Subedaar...

83
00:06:02,142 --> 00:06:04,133
for consenting to meet me.

84
00:06:05,545 --> 00:06:07,103
This interview...

85
00:06:07,247 --> 00:06:08,976
is very important to me.

86
00:06:09,349 --> 00:06:10,145
Hey...

87
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,376
- What are you doing?
- What the...

88
00:06:11,451 --> 00:06:12,213
My n... n...

89
00:06:12,318 --> 00:06:14,377
I was just taking out my notebook.

90
00:06:14,454 --> 00:06:15,944
The way you moved your hands...

91
00:06:16,022 --> 00:06:17,216
I thought you had a bomb in there.

92
00:06:17,323 --> 00:06:18,756
Let it be.

93
00:06:18,825 --> 00:06:20,315
Sir, I'm downstairs.

94
00:06:32,672 --> 00:06:34,264
Sit down.

95
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,103
Any difficulty in sitting on the floor?

96
00:06:38,945 --> 00:06:40,572
You are way younger than I am!

97
00:06:49,823 --> 00:06:51,791
You are Major Chauhan's nephew?

98
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,491
Yes sir, he's my uncle.

99
00:06:55,562 --> 00:06:57,223
Why aren't you in the army?

100
00:06:58,031 --> 00:06:59,293
Sir, I...

101
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:01,223
I'm passionate about writing.

102
00:07:02,135 --> 00:07:05,593
With your blessings I hope to become a well known writer.

103
00:07:05,705 --> 00:07:08,936
You work at leisure and it shows on your body!

104
00:07:09,609 --> 00:07:10,837
Get rid of it.

105
00:07:11,678 --> 00:07:14,169
From tomorrow, start running four kilometres, everyday.

106
00:07:14,414 --> 00:07:15,506
Huh?

107
00:07:15,582 --> 00:07:16,947
Say, 'from tomorrow'.

108
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:18,517
From t... t... tomorrow.

109
00:07:18,585 --> 00:07:21,145
- Say properly, 'from tomorrow'.
- From tomorrow.

110
00:07:26,626 --> 00:07:28,025
Shall we begin, sir?

111
00:07:32,999 --> 00:07:34,489
How did you become a dacoit?

112
00:07:42,809 --> 00:07:45,334
Are you a qualified journalist or still training?

113
00:07:47,213 --> 00:07:49,238
Don't you know the customs of this locality?

114
00:07:50,116 --> 00:07:52,209
In the ravines we're called rebels.

115
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:54,510
Dacoits are found in the parliament.

116
00:07:54,554 --> 00:07:55,748
P... p... p...

117
00:07:56,856 --> 00:07:58,153
Forget it. The session's over.

118
00:07:58,391 --> 00:08:00,723
- N... no...
- Take your stuff and leave.

119
00:08:00,827 --> 00:08:02,658
- Subedaar, I... I... I'm sorry...
- I said it's over.

120
00:08:02,762 --> 00:08:04,320
It's over.

121
00:08:04,397 --> 00:08:05,830
What I meant was...

122
00:08:06,366 --> 00:08:07,958
your c... career...

123
00:08:10,537 --> 00:08:11,731
I mean...

124
00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:14,530
When did you pick up the gun for the first time?

125
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:18,571
That's the question.

126
00:08:23,116 --> 00:08:24,811
The British fled...

127
00:08:25,585 --> 00:08:27,143
and then...

128
00:08:29,556 --> 00:08:31,649
Pandit Nehru became the Prime Minister.

129
00:08:32,792 --> 00:08:35,556
With a new beginning for India...

130
00:08:35,595 --> 00:08:37,859
I too started a new chapter in my life.

131
00:08:52,779 --> 00:08:54,872
Ramcharan, look who's coming this way?

132
00:08:54,948 --> 00:08:57,075
Daughter-in-law come here.

133
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,344
Who is that?

134
00:08:58,418 --> 00:08:59,578
Who is he?

135
00:09:00,119 --> 00:09:01,450
Look who's coming!

136
00:09:12,498 --> 00:09:15,899
My son is home.

137
00:09:19,272 --> 00:09:22,241
He is an army man now!

138
00:09:24,544 --> 00:09:27,138
Look what I brought for you.

139
00:09:28,481 --> 00:09:31,177
If not us at least think about your wife.

140
00:09:32,585 --> 00:09:34,746
I'm sorry, forgive me.

141
00:09:34,821 --> 00:09:36,379
Apologise to your wife!

142
00:09:36,489 --> 00:09:39,117
Now, can I get something to eat?

143
00:09:50,737 --> 00:09:52,329
Let me help you.

144
00:09:52,405 --> 00:09:53,667
Don't bother!

145
00:09:54,641 --> 00:09:56,370
I'm used to staying alone.

146
00:09:56,442 --> 00:09:57,636
Don't spoil me.

147
00:09:57,744 --> 00:09:59,803
If you are so used to it then I'll go back tomorrow.

148
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,772
Fine...

149
00:10:01,848 --> 00:10:04,078
you leave, and I'll jump into the well.

150
00:10:20,099 --> 00:10:21,930
You've been hiding here.

151
00:10:22,435 --> 00:10:24,232
You're a good runner.

152
00:10:24,704 --> 00:10:26,296
Just like a rooster.

153
00:10:26,706 --> 00:10:29,800
Okay... swift as a cat!

154
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:35,109
I've organised a village discourse...

155
00:10:35,214 --> 00:10:36,909
everyone is busy out there.

156
00:10:48,261 --> 00:10:49,626
Look at me.

157
00:11:06,412 --> 00:11:08,903
Did you also think I had died?

158
00:11:09,515 --> 00:11:11,642
Don't say that.

159
00:11:13,453 --> 00:11:15,353
I had shown your horoscope to the priest.

160
00:11:16,389 --> 00:11:20,257
He said, you were a born wanderer.

161
00:11:20,626 --> 00:11:22,059
But I knew...

162
00:11:22,762 --> 00:11:24,753
no matter what...

163
00:11:24,864 --> 00:11:26,957
you would come back to me.

164
00:11:32,939 --> 00:11:34,338
This is the army, not a government office...

165
00:11:34,407 --> 00:11:35,965
where you can do as you please.

166
00:11:36,242 --> 00:11:37,971
Why are you late by two days?

167
00:11:38,044 --> 00:11:39,773
Sir, my mother was ill.

168
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:41,278
Sir, I was getting married.

169
00:11:41,381 --> 00:11:43,076
The Army comes first, and family later.

170
00:11:43,182 --> 00:11:44,080
And you?

171
00:11:44,183 --> 00:11:46,447
Sir, I had to harvest the standing crop.

172
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:48,350
Soon you won't be standing either!

173
00:11:48,454 --> 00:11:51,287
Run ten rounds with luggage on your head.

174
00:11:59,198 --> 00:12:00,665
Left, right, left.

175
00:12:00,733 --> 00:12:02,462
Attention!

176
00:12:04,437 --> 00:12:06,166
Ten...
I did ten rounds, sir.

177
00:12:10,276 --> 00:12:11,675
You think I'm an idiot?

178
00:12:11,778 --> 00:12:12,706
I'm a fast runner.

179
00:12:12,707 --> 00:12:14,406
I have no problem with running.

180
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,812
Great, then run another ten rounds.

181
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:18,915
With or without my luggage, sir?

182
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:33,221
Rakesh...

183
00:12:35,535 --> 00:12:36,763
Who is this guy?

184
00:12:36,836 --> 00:12:39,430
He's a new recruit, Paan Singh Tomar.

185
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:43,805
For the first time I've seen someone enjoying his punishment.

186
00:12:53,219 --> 00:12:54,447
That's 37 rupees.

187
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:57,421
How will you manage with just two rupees?

188
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:59,458
The military takes care of my needs.

189
00:12:59,525 --> 00:13:00,787
My wife has just
delivered a baby girl.

190
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,259
Congratulations!

191
00:13:03,029 --> 00:13:05,122
I need to take care of their needs now.

192
00:13:14,874 --> 00:13:17,072
Do you eat to live?

193
00:13:17,073 --> 00:13:19,038
Or live to eat?

194
00:13:20,179 --> 00:13:22,044
This is the bread for living...

195
00:13:22,381 --> 00:13:23,848
and this is the bread for eating.

196
00:13:24,383 --> 00:13:25,577
Take some?

197
00:13:26,119 --> 00:13:27,814
Take it.

198
00:13:30,523 --> 00:13:31,649
Paan Singh...

199
00:13:31,724 --> 00:13:33,282
this is a battalion, not a bachelor's party.

200
00:13:33,392 --> 00:13:36,225
We're short on supplies and you will starve us to death.

201
00:13:36,329 --> 00:13:37,660
I have a large appetite.

202
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:41,131
Get into sports, there is no dearth of food there.

203
00:13:47,607 --> 00:13:48,295
Bye, ma'am.

204
00:13:48,296 --> 00:13:50,235
Have a great time in Gwalior.

205
00:13:54,213 --> 00:13:56,477
The British left behind two great things, sir.

206
00:13:57,049 --> 00:13:58,607
First is discipline...

207
00:13:58,885 --> 00:14:00,750
and the second is ice-cream.

208
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,344
I've got some for you.

209
00:14:03,122 --> 00:14:05,090
Take some home, ma'am will love it.

210
00:14:05,191 --> 00:14:06,886
No, no...
By the time I get home...

211
00:14:06,993 --> 00:14:09,461
it will become a milkshake!

212
00:14:09,562 --> 00:14:10,722
Sir...

213
00:14:12,832 --> 00:14:13,764
Take me into sports.

214
00:14:13,866 --> 00:14:15,493
There is no restriction on food there.

215
00:14:15,568 --> 00:14:16,728
Sports?

216
00:14:17,003 --> 00:14:18,129
Which sport?

217
00:14:18,204 --> 00:14:20,672
Anything, sir.
I even run very fast.

218
00:14:20,773 --> 00:14:22,502
Oh really?

219
00:14:22,575 --> 00:14:23,906
Yes, I love to run.

220
00:14:23,943 --> 00:14:27,208
Fine, if you deliver this ice-cream to the Major's house...

221
00:14:27,313 --> 00:14:28,507
before it melts!

222
00:14:28,581 --> 00:14:29,946
Then you are a sportsman.

223
00:14:30,049 --> 00:14:31,175
The address, sir?

224
00:15:11,257 --> 00:15:13,782
The Major has sent this.

225
00:15:13,893 --> 00:15:15,258
You can check it's not melted.

226
00:15:15,795 --> 00:15:17,262
What is the time now?

227
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:18,991
It's nine o'clock.
Why?

228
00:15:19,765 --> 00:15:21,665
Tell him I was here in four minutes.

229
00:15:21,734 --> 00:15:22,962
What?

230
00:15:48,828 --> 00:15:50,159
Paan Singh... run!!

231
00:15:50,229 --> 00:15:51,423
You're supposed to run at the signal...

232
00:15:51,497 --> 00:15:53,788
not recite a prayer, you idiot!

233
00:15:53,789 --> 00:15:54,432
Now run!

234
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:01,139
He is one who delivered the ice cream in four minutes!

235
00:16:38,944 --> 00:16:40,424
Congratulations, Paan Singh!

236
00:16:40,425 --> 00:16:41,640
You're the runner-up.

237
00:16:41,747 --> 00:16:43,009
Sir, are these for the athletes?

238
00:16:43,082 --> 00:16:45,915
Paan Singh has potential.

239
00:16:46,652 --> 00:16:50,019
But he wants to be a sportsman to satisfy his hunger!

240
00:16:50,089 --> 00:16:52,387
Don't think he is interested in sports.

241
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:01,528
Hit it hard.

242
00:17:02,735 --> 00:17:04,669
Harder, now.

243
00:17:14,513 --> 00:17:15,207
Load them up.

244
00:17:15,314 --> 00:17:17,248
My father fought against the British...

245
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:19,648
and he sent me here...

246
00:17:19,752 --> 00:17:21,310
to serve the country.

247
00:17:21,754 --> 00:17:22,860
I can't do this.

248
00:17:22,861 --> 00:17:24,518
I can't operate a gun.

249
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:26,514
You are an idiot.
Say, 'yes'.

250
00:17:28,227 --> 00:17:29,421
Say 'yes'.

251
00:17:29,462 --> 00:17:30,588
Yes, sir.

252
00:17:30,663 --> 00:17:32,426
It's easy.

253
00:17:32,498 --> 00:17:34,193
Strap on the gun...
shut one eye...

254
00:17:34,266 --> 00:17:35,494
aim at your target and pull the trigger.

255
00:17:35,601 --> 00:17:36,659
It's as simple as that.

256
00:17:36,736 --> 00:17:37,896
What's going on here?

257
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:39,894
He's new here.

258
00:17:39,895 --> 00:17:41,539
I'm teaching him to shoot.

259
00:17:41,907 --> 00:17:43,067
He's new here...

260
00:17:43,142 --> 00:17:44,302
and you were born with a gun?

261
00:17:44,377 --> 00:17:46,368
The gun and I share a long relationship.

262
00:17:46,479 --> 00:17:48,003
My uncle owns four Mark-3 guns.

263
00:17:48,114 --> 00:17:48,990
Is that so?

264
00:17:48,991 --> 00:17:51,140
Then show me your skills.

265
00:17:52,585 --> 00:17:54,553
Nobody else fires!

266
00:18:02,261 --> 00:18:03,421
On your feet!

267
00:18:05,064 --> 00:18:06,156
Sir.

268
00:18:06,532 --> 00:18:07,692
Where are you from?

269
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,324
From Bhidosa, in Morena district.

270
00:18:09,769 --> 00:18:13,034
I see, the Chambal Valley.
Dacoit area!

271
00:18:13,105 --> 00:18:14,538
Not dacoits. They are rebels.

272
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,167
My uncle was a rebel too, and a respected one.

273
00:18:18,544 --> 00:18:20,478
The cops have not been able to nab him.

274
00:18:23,349 --> 00:18:24,646
Recruit Paan Singh...

275
00:18:25,518 --> 00:18:27,679
was your uncle a dacoit?

276
00:18:27,753 --> 00:18:29,744
Not a dacoit.
He was a rebel.

277
00:18:29,822 --> 00:18:31,255
He was a good man.

278
00:18:31,357 --> 00:18:34,451
Stick to the question.

279
00:18:36,996 --> 00:18:38,429
There are no records...

280
00:18:38,497 --> 00:18:41,398
but have you ever been to jail?

281
00:18:41,467 --> 00:18:42,857
Not even my uncle.

282
00:18:42,858 --> 00:18:45,096
The police cannot catch us.

283
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:51,305
I asked you to stick to the question.

284
00:18:52,545 --> 00:18:54,740
Do you trust the government?

285
00:18:54,814 --> 00:18:56,475
No, sir, the government is a crook.

286
00:18:56,916 --> 00:18:59,749
That's why, I'm in the Army and not a government servant.

287
00:19:01,053 --> 00:19:03,817
Except the army, everyone is a swindler.

288
00:19:05,758 --> 00:19:07,555
Can you give your life for your country?

289
00:19:07,626 --> 00:19:09,218
Yes, and I can take lives too.

290
00:19:09,361 --> 00:19:10,953
This country is our motherland...

291
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:14,056
If anyone dares harm my mother, how can I bear it?

292
00:19:15,668 --> 00:19:18,000
The Army means discipline.

293
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:22,306
You need to obey the orders of your officer.

294
00:19:22,374 --> 00:19:24,842
Will you obey every order?

295
00:19:26,078 --> 00:19:28,672
Sir, I'm a fourth grade drop out.

296
00:19:29,215 --> 00:19:31,308
I've learnt more from experience than books.

297
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,741
If an officer like you gives me an order...

298
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,919
I'd give up my life.

299
00:19:38,924 --> 00:19:42,826
But, sir, a few officers here are just for namesake.

300
00:19:42,862 --> 00:19:44,625
They are good for nothing.

301
00:19:46,565 --> 00:19:49,125
I'm not too sure about their orders.

302
00:19:49,535 --> 00:19:51,264
Sir, let me talk to him.

303
00:19:51,337 --> 00:19:53,601
Major Masand, this is the man you were recommending.

304
00:19:53,672 --> 00:19:56,031
Have you heard what he is saying?

305
00:19:56,032 --> 00:19:57,904
He shouldn't even be here.

306
00:19:57,977 --> 00:19:59,082
I still have my doubts.

307
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:00,571
I'm trying to understand.

308
00:20:00,679 --> 00:20:03,273
Sir, what he is trying to say is something different...

309
00:20:03,349 --> 00:20:05,214
Did I say something wrong, sir?

310
00:20:05,718 --> 00:20:07,609
Paan Singh, it's okay.

311
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:09,586
You may wait outside.

312
00:20:16,795 --> 00:20:18,255
Check out his attitude.

313
00:20:18,256 --> 00:20:20,287
He's got a rebel for an uncle.

314
00:20:20,399 --> 00:20:21,627
Great!

315
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:24,430
- Army officers are useless.
- Sir...

316
00:20:24,503 --> 00:20:26,464
He is the best recipe for a mutiny!

317
00:20:26,465 --> 00:20:28,371
We have to do something about him.

318
00:20:28,474 --> 00:20:29,634
I have an idea...

319
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:33,735
we should send him to the Army Physical Training Centre.

320
00:20:34,179 --> 00:20:35,984
He can run as much as he wants to.

321
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:37,376
That will cool his temper.

322
00:20:37,483 --> 00:20:39,314
We should use him to our advantage.

323
00:20:41,086 --> 00:20:43,520
You haven't seen him run yet.

324
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:59,262
Good morning...

325
00:20:59,338 --> 00:21:03,138
Looks like you stepped out of bed and onto the ground!

326
00:21:03,242 --> 00:21:04,834
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning...

327
00:21:05,244 --> 00:21:07,312
Greetings Gurveer, everything okay?

328
00:21:07,313 --> 00:21:08,805
Greetings to you too.

329
00:21:08,914 --> 00:21:10,347
Done with the warm up?

330
00:21:10,482 --> 00:21:12,008
It makes no difference to me.

331
00:21:12,009 --> 00:21:13,007
I'm always ready.

332
00:21:13,285 --> 00:21:15,549
All of you here, for the 5000 metre race.

333
00:21:15,955 --> 00:21:17,718
Everyone on your feet!

334
00:21:18,157 --> 00:21:19,749
Let's begin the race!

335
00:21:23,228 --> 00:21:25,492
- Jai Hind, coach.
- Jai Hind!

336
00:21:25,598 --> 00:21:27,828
Aren't you from Bengal Engineers?

337
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:28,730
Yes, sir.

338
00:21:28,834 --> 00:21:29,994
You want to run the 5000 metre?

339
00:21:30,069 --> 00:21:30,865
Yes, sir.

340
00:21:30,936 --> 00:21:32,096
Let's go.

341
00:21:32,438 --> 00:21:33,905
What's your name?

342
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,164
My name is Paan Singh Tomar, sir.

343
00:21:36,275 --> 00:21:38,675
Athletes... on your mark!

344
00:23:04,163 --> 00:23:05,892
- Jai Hind, sir.
- Jai Hind!

345
00:23:06,665 --> 00:23:08,015
Hold on, Paan Singh.

346
00:23:08,016 --> 00:23:09,634
I need to talk to you.

347
00:23:09,702 --> 00:23:10,862
About what?

348
00:23:10,936 --> 00:23:13,427
I need to discuss something very important.

349
00:23:13,472 --> 00:23:14,666
Come along.

350
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:17,665
Don't mind my words.

351
00:23:17,743 --> 00:23:19,836
- Greetings, coach.
- Greetings.

352
00:23:20,345 --> 00:23:23,644
I suggest you don't run the 5000 metres race.

353
00:23:23,749 --> 00:23:25,046
Don't run?!

354
00:23:26,251 --> 00:23:28,116
Not take part in the 5000 metre race?

355
00:23:30,589 --> 00:23:33,251
But I've been sent here for this race.

356
00:23:33,692 --> 00:23:36,217
I have other plans for you.

357
00:23:36,929 --> 00:23:39,727
You are a good runner, with a good stamina.

358
00:23:39,832 --> 00:23:42,494
You should run a different race.

359
00:23:45,471 --> 00:23:47,268
All these months that's what I've been practicing for.

360
00:23:47,339 --> 00:23:48,772
The Defence Meet is in two months...

361
00:23:48,841 --> 00:23:50,206
where I have to win a medal.

362
00:23:50,275 --> 00:23:51,936
Why are you stuck on the Defence Meet?

363
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:54,376
I want to make you a national champion.

364
00:23:54,446 --> 00:23:56,380
So why not in 5000 metres?

365
00:23:58,951 --> 00:24:00,043
Listen to me.

366
00:24:00,152 --> 00:24:03,644
If you run the 5000 metre, Gurveer will lose...

367
00:24:03,722 --> 00:24:05,656
How does this concern me?

368
00:24:05,724 --> 00:24:07,089
Listen...

369
00:24:07,192 --> 00:24:10,525
My daughter is married to Gurveer's brother.

370
00:24:12,197 --> 00:24:13,755
My daughter is already suffering.

371
00:24:14,399 --> 00:24:16,526
If Gurveer loses, his brother will...

372
00:24:16,668 --> 00:24:18,465
take it out on my daughter.

373
00:24:18,537 --> 00:24:20,232
I get it, coach.

374
00:24:23,142 --> 00:24:25,201
Since this concerns my teacher's daughter...

375
00:24:25,277 --> 00:24:28,269
I can run on hot coals now.

376
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:33,108
Bless you, my son.

377
00:24:33,952 --> 00:24:38,082
Not fire, you will run on water.

378
00:24:38,323 --> 00:24:39,483
On water?

379
00:24:39,558 --> 00:24:42,026
You will run the steeplechase!

380
00:24:42,127 --> 00:24:44,152
Steeplechase.

381
00:24:46,565 --> 00:24:47,725
Yes, sir.

382
00:24:48,567 --> 00:24:49,829
I will run.

383
00:25:09,321 --> 00:25:14,725
Earlier, the steeplechase was a race meant for horses.

384
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:17,558
Later, this was introduced into athletics.

385
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:20,061
Watch carefully...

386
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,468
There are 28 hurdles.

387
00:25:25,904 --> 00:25:31,900
And 7 water pits, which you have to cross to finish the race.

388
00:25:33,412 --> 00:25:39,282
If horses and donkeys can do it
then you are way better than them!

389
00:26:01,173 --> 00:26:05,234
Praise the Lord!

390
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:19,084
Very good.

391
00:26:19,725 --> 00:26:21,852
Remember you're training for the National Games.

392
00:27:25,524 --> 00:27:28,196
Now, the last track and field event.

393
00:27:28,197 --> 00:27:30,291
The 3000 metre steeplechase.

394
00:27:30,362 --> 00:27:33,525
Athletes on your mark!

395
00:27:33,598 --> 00:27:36,624
Use your stamina wisely.

396
00:27:36,735 --> 00:27:39,169
Why do you keep looking behind you?

397
00:27:39,271 --> 00:27:42,001
Do you think you're in a wedding procession?

398
00:27:47,045 --> 00:27:48,273
What's wrong?

399
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:49,119
Sir, I'm thirsty.

400
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,075
I'd like some water.

401
00:27:50,182 --> 00:27:51,809
Have you lost it?

402
00:27:51,883 --> 00:27:54,579
It's a race, not a pissing competition!

403
00:28:56,882 --> 00:29:01,649
Paan Singh, if you lose this race, you motherfucccr...

404
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:05,212
I will bury you right here in this ground.

405
00:29:14,166 --> 00:29:16,225
What are you doing?!

406
00:29:57,742 --> 00:30:00,404
- The time?
- It's 9:12:04.

407
00:30:00,512 --> 00:30:02,115
You clocked 9:12:04.

408
00:30:02,116 --> 00:30:04,039
A new national record.

409
00:30:04,316 --> 00:30:07,547
Congratulations...
this is unbelievable!

410
00:30:09,287 --> 00:30:11,551
You're the national champion.

411
00:30:11,656 --> 00:30:13,123
You broke the record.

412
00:30:13,191 --> 00:30:16,126
I knew you were champion material!

413
00:30:19,364 --> 00:30:20,515
What's the matter?

414
00:30:20,516 --> 00:30:21,730
Aren't you happy?

415
00:30:23,902 --> 00:30:25,767
Coach, the thing is...

416
00:30:26,171 --> 00:30:27,798
you are my teacher.

417
00:30:27,906 --> 00:30:29,737
But next time you shout at me...

418
00:30:29,908 --> 00:30:31,603
don't abuse my mother!

419
00:30:35,113 --> 00:30:37,343
You know it's a habit, Paan Singh.

420
00:30:37,449 --> 00:30:39,041
I also have a habit.

421
00:30:39,117 --> 00:30:41,210
I pull the trigger when I hear abuses.

422
00:30:41,286 --> 00:30:43,447
I love my mother a lot.

423
00:31:24,429 --> 00:31:27,523
Hanumanta, go get some lemon toffees.

424
00:31:28,867 --> 00:31:30,960
The shop here is no good.

425
00:31:31,369 --> 00:31:34,634
You get better ones near the bus stop.

426
00:31:36,808 --> 00:31:38,537
Take your sister along.

427
00:31:50,488 --> 00:31:52,479
I didn't get anything for you.

428
00:31:53,325 --> 00:31:55,102
Can you make something sweet?

429
00:31:55,103 --> 00:31:57,125
I have some good news to share.

430
00:31:57,195 --> 00:31:59,857
Tell me the good news, then I'll make the sweets.

431
00:32:00,832 --> 00:32:02,629
What if I don't like the news?

432
00:32:02,701 --> 00:32:03,776
I have been promoted.

433
00:32:03,777 --> 00:32:05,670
You are now the wife of a Subedaar.

434
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:07,670
I broke the National record.

435
00:32:08,206 --> 00:32:10,697
What have you broken this time?

436
00:32:10,809 --> 00:32:13,300
Every time you go out, you break something.

437
00:32:15,013 --> 00:32:17,880
Idiot! When will you learn?

438
00:32:18,083 --> 00:32:19,983
I haven't broken anything. It means...

439
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:23,885
I've set a new time record.

440
00:32:23,955 --> 00:32:25,217
Really?

441
00:32:26,424 --> 00:32:27,982
How would I know that?

442
00:32:38,203 --> 00:32:39,500
Let me go... no don't!

443
00:32:39,571 --> 00:32:40,435
Let me go...

444
00:32:40,505 --> 00:32:41,733
I said no!

445
00:32:53,451 --> 00:32:55,180
They're sending me abroad.

446
00:32:56,554 --> 00:32:57,987
Tokyo, Japan.

447
00:32:59,157 --> 00:33:01,648
Major athletes from Asia will be present.

448
00:33:04,396 --> 00:33:07,126
What do you want from Tokyo?

449
00:33:11,169 --> 00:33:12,500
Come.

450
00:33:13,705 --> 00:33:15,536
- Going abroad?
- Yes.

451
00:33:17,309 --> 00:33:18,606
What do you want?

452
00:33:23,548 --> 00:33:28,042
I don't like the way you run in shorts.

453
00:33:28,253 --> 00:33:29,914
The women stare at you.

454
00:33:30,655 --> 00:33:33,021
Should I run in my pajamas?

455
00:33:34,626 --> 00:33:36,150
What if I bring home a Japanese wife?

456
00:33:36,961 --> 00:33:39,521
Which well will you jump into?

457
00:33:41,232 --> 00:33:43,200
I'll lie down on the rail tracks.

458
00:33:44,002 --> 00:33:45,401
Let me just kill you then.

459
00:33:46,805 --> 00:33:47,999
Shall I?

460
00:33:51,976 --> 00:33:53,876
The kids will be here.

461
00:33:53,945 --> 00:33:55,071
No...

462
00:33:55,113 --> 00:33:57,604
No... don't...

463
00:34:06,658 --> 00:34:07,852
Let go!

464
00:34:41,659 --> 00:34:44,321
Water... drinking water?

465
00:34:45,997 --> 00:34:47,521
Coach...

466
00:34:47,632 --> 00:34:48,621
do I need to wear these?

467
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:49,826
Of course, it's necessary.

468
00:34:49,901 --> 00:34:53,268
Coach, with these nails, the shoes will dig into the earth.

469
00:34:53,338 --> 00:34:55,067
- They are called spikes.
- What?

470
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:57,267
Spikes! Come on...

471
00:34:57,342 --> 00:34:59,469
Indian athletes will participate without spikes?

472
00:34:59,544 --> 00:35:00,772
Why didn't you give these for practice?

473
00:35:00,879 --> 00:35:02,642
I've been running wearing canvas shoes.

474
00:35:02,747 --> 00:35:06,114
Now, you're giving these to me and that too, at the competition.

475
00:35:06,184 --> 00:35:09,779
So, the world should mock Indian athletes?

476
00:35:09,854 --> 00:35:11,481
Look at the other athletes.

477
00:35:11,589 --> 00:35:12,556
Why should I?

478
00:35:12,624 --> 00:35:15,024
They get good food and all the facilities.

479
00:35:15,059 --> 00:35:16,993
You expect us to win a medal on two egg yolks?!

480
00:35:17,061 --> 00:35:18,085
What's your point?

481
00:35:18,196 --> 00:35:19,595
Whatever you want to make of it!

482
00:35:19,664 --> 00:35:22,030
Don't act smart!
Get it?

483
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:24,500
Wear the shoes and take your position.

484
00:35:24,569 --> 00:35:27,834
Come on... you will definitely win!
Move it!

485
00:36:56,427 --> 00:36:58,520
That day I lost the race.

486
00:36:58,830 --> 00:37:01,060
I regret it to this day.

487
00:37:01,165 --> 00:37:02,632
And I always will.

488
00:37:03,134 --> 00:37:03,966
Don't be upset.

489
00:37:03,967 --> 00:37:05,796
I had to take my shoes off.

490
00:37:05,904 --> 00:37:07,269
It's okay.

491
00:37:07,372 --> 00:37:08,913
They don't give us facilities.

492
00:37:08,914 --> 00:37:10,603
They just keep asking for medals.

493
00:37:14,646 --> 00:37:15,874
You know English?

494
00:37:23,388 --> 00:37:25,312
I don't understand what they are saying.

495
00:37:25,313 --> 00:37:26,016
You handle it.

496
00:37:26,991 --> 00:37:29,983
Sir, could you please tell us your name?

497
00:37:30,094 --> 00:37:31,322
Oh?!

498
00:37:32,697 --> 00:37:33,755
Paan Singh Tomar.

499
00:37:34,632 --> 00:37:36,122
Paan Singh Tomar.

500
00:37:39,203 --> 00:37:41,501
Paan Singh Tomar, India.

501
00:37:42,006 --> 00:37:43,303
India.

502
00:37:43,975 --> 00:37:46,068
Paan Singh I love you.

503
00:37:46,144 --> 00:37:48,135
She is in love with you.

504
00:38:01,426 --> 00:38:02,857
All he's brought back is dirty clothes!

505
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:03,519
How is she?

506
00:38:03,628 --> 00:38:04,652
She's nice.

507
00:38:04,762 --> 00:38:05,888
Just nice?

508
00:38:05,997 --> 00:38:07,325
He has me to clean up after him.

509
00:38:07,332 --> 00:38:10,301
Did he go there for a medal or a new wife!

510
00:38:10,368 --> 00:38:12,427
I'd almost decided on settling there.

511
00:38:12,537 --> 00:38:13,936
What stopped you?

512
00:38:14,072 --> 00:38:15,664
Your cooking!

513
00:38:15,773 --> 00:38:17,798
The food there is terrible!

514
00:38:17,909 --> 00:38:20,377
No difference between a dog and a duck.

515
00:38:20,478 --> 00:38:22,139
All you remembered, was my cooking!

516
00:38:23,381 --> 00:38:26,043
Hanu, get some lemon toffee.

517
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:27,849
They are not going anywhere.

518
00:38:27,850 --> 00:38:28,880
Sit right here.

519
00:38:28,987 --> 00:38:30,049
Here is the money.

520
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:31,820
I said, you will not go.

521
00:38:31,923 --> 00:38:32,615
Let the kids go.

522
00:38:32,616 --> 00:38:33,652
They aren't going!

523
00:38:33,758 --> 00:38:34,998
- Let them eat the toffee

524
00:38:34,999 --> 00:38:36,386
- I said, you will not go.

525
00:38:36,527 --> 00:38:37,608
Didn't you hear me?

526
00:38:37,609 --> 00:38:38,461
You won't go!

527
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:41,021
Lemon toffees, my foot!

528
00:38:41,532 --> 00:38:42,863
They aren't going anywhere!

529
00:39:15,833 --> 00:39:18,427
Hanu, time you took a break from studying.

530
00:39:18,536 --> 00:39:22,939
Go out for a while and get my clothes from the tailor.

531
00:39:23,041 --> 00:39:25,129
Take your sister along.

532
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:27,307
She needs a new dress.

533
00:39:29,747 --> 00:39:32,443
Don't hurry with the measurements.

534
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,121
So, you put the kids to work?!

535
00:39:46,397 --> 00:39:49,423
Were you really going to bring that Japanese woman here?

536
00:39:49,534 --> 00:39:50,728
Absolutely.

537
00:39:51,436 --> 00:39:54,098
You don't even like me running, and she is crazy about it.

538
00:39:54,205 --> 00:39:55,536
Look at this.

539
00:39:56,908 --> 00:39:58,375
Look at me.

540
00:39:59,243 --> 00:40:00,175
One second...

541
00:40:00,945 --> 00:40:01,717
What are you doing?

542
00:40:01,718 --> 00:40:03,140
This is how it's done abroad.

543
00:40:03,614 --> 00:40:04,532
Stupid girl!

544
00:40:04,533 --> 00:40:06,674
Abroad, what they do is...

545
00:40:06,784 --> 00:40:09,719
here... right here and then...

546
00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:14,387
This is the moment...

547
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:17,851
to show your valour...

548
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:23,293
and die for your country which is every soldier's dream.

549
00:40:24,135 --> 00:40:25,432
Soldiers...

550
00:40:26,137 --> 00:40:29,300
you have undergone rigorous training...

551
00:40:29,874 --> 00:40:32,308
and now it's time to show your strength.

552
00:40:34,245 --> 00:40:37,703
They have started the war but we will end it!

553
00:40:39,617 --> 00:40:42,108
Promise your motherland that...

554
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:47,289
before you become a martyr, you will kill ten of the enemy!

555
00:40:49,727 --> 00:40:51,718
- 51...
- Victory!

556
00:40:51,829 --> 00:40:53,592
- 51...
- Victory!

557
00:40:53,698 --> 00:40:55,632
- 51...
- Victory!

558
00:41:21,125 --> 00:41:23,025
- The code will be Bravo.
- Yes, sir.

559
00:41:23,127 --> 00:41:25,527
- G. S reservation.
- Yes, sir.

560
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:27,655
The Battalion moves at 1500 hours.

561
00:41:27,765 --> 00:41:28,527
- Any doubt?
- No, sir.

562
00:41:28,666 --> 00:41:29,564
Move.

563
00:41:30,067 --> 00:41:31,159
Victory to India.

564
00:41:32,837 --> 00:41:33,963
Sir.

565
00:41:34,272 --> 00:41:36,001
Paan Singh... at ease.

566
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,737
Yes?

567
00:41:37,842 --> 00:41:40,140
Sir, why can't I go to the battlefront?

568
00:41:40,244 --> 00:41:41,398
It's an Army rule.

569
00:41:41,399 --> 00:41:43,771
Athletes are not sent to the front.

570
00:41:44,849 --> 00:41:46,680
I have a point...

571
00:41:47,885 --> 00:41:51,013
I won't be able to face my people in the village...

572
00:41:51,422 --> 00:41:52,230
Sir, please!

573
00:41:52,231 --> 00:41:54,653
The army can take all my medals...

574
00:41:54,759 --> 00:41:56,556
I'm ready to forego sports.

575
00:41:56,557 --> 00:41:58,752
I cannot lose this opportunity.

576
00:41:58,863 --> 00:42:01,957
Let me go there once, please.

577
00:42:02,066 --> 00:42:03,590
You will stay right here.

578
00:42:05,303 --> 00:42:06,531
Move.

579
00:42:20,318 --> 00:42:21,683
What happened, Paan Singh?

580
00:42:21,684 --> 00:42:23,048
Not coming to the front?

581
00:42:23,487 --> 00:42:24,852
On sick leave?

582
00:42:32,897 --> 00:42:35,195
- 51...
- Victory!

583
00:42:35,299 --> 00:42:37,494
- 51...
- Victory!

584
00:42:43,474 --> 00:42:47,035
The war of 1965 took place and they said...

585
00:42:47,845 --> 00:42:49,813
athletes are the nation's precious treasure.

586
00:42:49,914 --> 00:42:52,041
And they won't be sent to war.

587
00:42:52,149 --> 00:42:54,982
I desperately wished I could do away with the rule.

588
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:58,817
My wish of defeating the enemy did not die out...

589
00:42:59,457 --> 00:43:01,049
and I got my chance.

590
00:43:01,158 --> 00:43:02,648
In the year 1967.

591
00:43:03,261 --> 00:43:05,661
At the International Defence Meet.

592
00:43:06,664 --> 00:43:07,221
He's lost it.

593
00:43:07,222 --> 00:43:08,291
Sir, explain it to him.

594
00:43:08,399 --> 00:43:10,403
There are athletes half his age.

595
00:43:10,404 --> 00:43:11,800
He'll definitely lose.

596
00:43:12,436 --> 00:43:14,404
It's impossible to explain this to him.

597
00:43:14,505 --> 00:43:15,938
He wasn't able to fight in the war...

598
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:18,372
so now, this is his battlefield.

599
00:43:18,476 --> 00:43:21,138
Sir, this is the International Defence Athletic Meet...

600
00:43:21,245 --> 00:43:23,008
not a battlefield.

601
00:43:23,114 --> 00:43:24,604
For him it is!

602
00:43:27,285 --> 00:43:28,809
So, Paan Singh?

603
00:43:30,121 --> 00:43:32,453
You are participating in an international meet.

604
00:43:33,758 --> 00:43:35,123
You've grown older.

605
00:43:36,527 --> 00:43:37,926
What if you lose?

606
00:43:39,196 --> 00:43:41,130
You didn't send me to the battlefield...

607
00:43:41,232 --> 00:43:43,097
To put my life at stake

608
00:43:44,468 --> 00:43:47,699
Now with my self respect at stake,
the playground will be my battleground.

609
00:45:13,157 --> 00:45:17,025
That was the most important race of my life.

610
00:45:17,595 --> 00:45:19,392
There was no record involved...

611
00:45:20,031 --> 00:45:21,555
- but that race...
- Excuse me?

612
00:45:21,665 --> 00:45:23,132
- Will you help me with this?
- Sure.

613
00:45:23,234 --> 00:45:24,599
The biggest race.

614
00:45:41,585 --> 00:45:43,059
Will you eat something?

615
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:44,918
The mutton looks delicious.

616
00:45:59,637 --> 00:46:02,936
Why did he eat it first?

617
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:04,800
This is how my life is.

618
00:46:04,801 --> 00:46:06,835
I need to be alert 24 hours.

619
00:46:07,678 --> 00:46:10,146
If it is poisoned, the person who eats first, dies.

620
00:46:10,781 --> 00:46:11,338
Okay.

621
00:46:11,415 --> 00:46:13,246
The meat is absolutely delicious.

622
00:46:14,018 --> 00:46:16,248
Don't be shy, have some.

623
00:46:17,955 --> 00:46:19,115
Okay.

624
00:46:19,857 --> 00:46:23,452
Now I can proclaim that I have dined with you.

625
00:46:26,697 --> 00:46:28,562
Let it be.
Meat is not good for you.

626
00:46:28,966 --> 00:46:30,991
Start running, lose some weight.

627
00:46:31,602 --> 00:46:33,399
- Then you can eat it.
- Right.

628
00:46:34,238 --> 00:46:36,103
Go on.
I can continue talking.

629
00:46:37,308 --> 00:46:38,639
Okay.

630
00:46:44,515 --> 00:46:46,813
When did you leave the Army?

631
00:46:52,590 --> 00:46:56,151
In the recently concluded International Defence Games...

632
00:46:56,227 --> 00:46:59,492
Subedaar Paan Singh Tomar, broke his own record...

633
00:46:59,597 --> 00:47:04,261
in the 3000 metre steeplechase race,
to establish a brand new record.

634
00:47:04,368 --> 00:47:06,268
It means, he broke his own record.

635
00:47:06,370 --> 00:47:07,166
Oh, okay.

636
00:47:07,271 --> 00:47:09,000
What's going on here?

637
00:47:12,109 --> 00:47:14,339
Now what is that no-good brother of yours up to?

638
00:47:14,445 --> 00:47:16,242
What do you mean, Bhanwar Singh?

639
00:47:16,347 --> 00:47:17,814
He's your cousin as well.

640
00:47:17,915 --> 00:47:19,473
So what has he done?

641
00:47:19,583 --> 00:47:22,518
Paan is the national champion again.

642
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:24,815
He's got a gold medal.

643
00:47:24,922 --> 00:47:26,899
A coward's job is to keep running.

644
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:28,085
What's the big deal?

645
00:47:28,192 --> 00:47:29,625
What are you saying?

646
00:47:29,727 --> 00:47:30,557
Why?

647
00:47:30,661 --> 00:47:33,095
He left his responsibilities, and ran to the army.

648
00:47:33,197 --> 00:47:35,392
Let him come back.
I'll present him...

649
00:47:35,499 --> 00:47:37,467
with a gold medal.

650
00:47:37,568 --> 00:47:39,502
Stupid coward.
Let's go.

651
00:47:42,673 --> 00:47:43,640
Father...

652
00:47:44,542 --> 00:47:46,032
father, uncle is here.

653
00:47:49,547 --> 00:47:52,015
He has grabbed the land next to the well.

654
00:47:53,951 --> 00:47:55,919
They let animals loose on standing crops.

655
00:47:57,288 --> 00:48:00,917
And when we protest this is what happens.

656
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:05,723
He has four licensed guns...
what can we do?

657
00:48:05,829 --> 00:48:08,320
Let's shoot Bhanwar Singh.
End of story.

658
00:48:08,432 --> 00:48:09,660
Shut up!

659
00:48:11,835 --> 00:48:13,928
You aren't even as heavy as the gun...

660
00:48:20,144 --> 00:48:22,044
I can't handle this on my own.

661
00:48:22,947 --> 00:48:24,437
We have to do something.

662
00:48:34,758 --> 00:48:36,419
You are still the same.

663
00:48:36,994 --> 00:48:38,591
I'll be back in six months.

664
00:48:38,592 --> 00:48:39,656
Fix yourjumping.

665
00:48:39,763 --> 00:48:41,697
Don't ever let your regiment down.

666
00:48:41,966 --> 00:48:44,867
We will break the record of your record-breaker.

667
00:48:45,002 --> 00:48:46,469
That's the spirit!

668
00:48:46,570 --> 00:48:49,198
- Victory to India.
- Subedaar...

669
00:48:50,307 --> 00:48:52,241
Colonel Masand is on line from Gwalior.

670
00:48:59,950 --> 00:49:03,283
Sir, I've taken premature retirement.

671
00:49:03,387 --> 00:49:05,651
Are you going to quit the game?

672
00:49:06,223 --> 00:49:11,092
Household duties and farming, are more dangerous sports.

673
00:49:11,395 --> 00:49:14,558
The coaching offer remains open for you.

674
00:49:14,665 --> 00:49:15,563
Sorry?

675
00:49:15,666 --> 00:49:17,497
You can be a coach with the Army.

676
00:49:17,601 --> 00:49:18,499
Yes, sir.

677
00:49:18,602 --> 00:49:20,035
I want to give you something.

678
00:49:20,170 --> 00:49:21,908
You've helped my son become an Army man.

679
00:49:21,909 --> 00:49:22,968
What else can I ask for?

680
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:25,372
Colonel Masand has sent this for you.

681
00:49:25,743 --> 00:49:28,371
It's ice cream.
Rings a bell?

682
00:49:28,846 --> 00:49:31,747
Let's see, if it melts...

683
00:49:31,849 --> 00:49:33,783
by the time you reach home.

684
00:49:48,999 --> 00:49:50,990
This is my biggest medal, sir.

685
00:50:47,424 --> 00:50:48,721
Brother...

686
00:50:49,793 --> 00:50:51,090
Brother...

687
00:50:52,363 --> 00:50:53,660
- Let's go...
- What's the matter?

688
00:50:53,764 --> 00:50:55,459
Our fields have been...
Lets go.

689
00:50:55,566 --> 00:50:57,090
What happened...

690
00:50:57,601 --> 00:50:59,338
I was there last evening.

691
00:50:59,339 --> 00:51:00,866
Everything was fine.

692
00:51:01,004 --> 00:51:03,370
Are you sure they are responsible?

693
00:51:04,441 --> 00:51:06,409
See here it is...

694
00:51:10,547 --> 00:51:11,809
Brother...

695
00:51:13,117 --> 00:51:14,345
Brother...

696
00:51:17,388 --> 00:51:19,515
What's the problem?

697
00:51:20,524 --> 00:51:21,923
What is it?

698
00:51:22,159 --> 00:51:23,353
Why are you barking early in the morning?

699
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:25,121
What is this?

700
00:51:25,229 --> 00:51:27,026
We own the farm, worked hard on this crop.

701
00:51:27,131 --> 00:51:28,689
How can you cut it?

702
00:51:28,799 --> 00:51:30,164
This is stealing.

703
00:51:30,267 --> 00:51:32,132
Who made you the constable?

704
00:51:33,637 --> 00:51:35,127
Answer me!

705
00:51:35,739 --> 00:51:38,936
The field and crops belong to us.

706
00:51:39,042 --> 00:51:41,636
It's ours to burn at the festival in two weeks.

707
00:51:41,879 --> 00:51:43,972
You can approach the court, if you want to.
Go!

708
00:51:44,081 --> 00:51:48,279
The courts are a pain and no one benefits.

709
00:51:49,019 --> 00:51:51,988
This is our crop, please give it back.

710
00:51:52,256 --> 00:51:55,123
But the documents show this is our land.

711
00:51:55,325 --> 00:51:57,350
I have paid Matadin for it.

712
00:51:57,461 --> 00:51:59,429
Yes, he sold his share.

713
00:52:04,601 --> 00:52:07,661
Yes, he sold his share but this is from my share.

714
00:52:07,905 --> 00:52:09,736
The land was divided equally by the village council.

715
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:11,330
That's funny!

716
00:52:12,476 --> 00:52:13,943
Listen, little boy...

717
00:52:14,511 --> 00:52:17,537
go and look at the land records for yourself.

718
00:52:18,048 --> 00:52:21,211
Go to the council, or the court, don't bother me.

719
00:52:21,452 --> 00:52:25,081
If I get angry, Your fate will be decided right here

720
00:52:25,756 --> 00:52:27,121
What will you do?

721
00:52:28,425 --> 00:52:31,485
- Tell me...
- Paan Singh... let's go.

722
00:52:32,463 --> 00:52:33,953
What will you do?

723
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:39,464
Let's go. Goodbye brother.

724
00:52:39,570 --> 00:52:41,538
Don't scare me with these guns...

725
00:52:41,539 --> 00:52:42,869
I've seen bigger ones.

726
00:53:01,091 --> 00:53:02,991
Colonel Masand?

727
00:53:03,827 --> 00:53:05,021
Jai Hind, sir.

728
00:53:05,496 --> 00:53:07,464
Subedaar Paan Singh speaking.

729
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:11,275
I'm in trouble.

730
00:53:11,276 --> 00:53:13,199
Things aren't good.

731
00:53:13,570 --> 00:53:16,596
My relatives have seized my farm and land.

732
00:53:16,707 --> 00:53:18,675
It's been two years now.

733
00:53:19,243 --> 00:53:20,437
Can your brother...

734
00:53:20,544 --> 00:53:23,069
request the Collector of Morena to solve our case?

735
00:53:23,213 --> 00:53:24,908
He's lying, sir.

736
00:53:25,349 --> 00:53:26,467
We own the land.

737
00:53:26,468 --> 00:53:28,284
They only till the land.

738
00:53:28,385 --> 00:53:31,183
This document will prove who is lying.

739
00:53:31,288 --> 00:53:34,553
My brother has sold his land, I've have not sold mine.

740
00:53:34,658 --> 00:53:39,118
They've bribed their way to register the land in their name.

741
00:53:39,263 --> 00:53:40,662
This is our land.

742
00:53:40,764 --> 00:53:42,857
Aren't you related?

743
00:53:42,966 --> 00:53:45,230
Yes, we are cousins...

744
00:53:45,569 --> 00:53:47,469
that's why he is alive.

745
00:53:47,571 --> 00:53:50,062
That is why you're alive, uncle...

746
00:53:50,173 --> 00:53:53,006
I wish I could celebrate your death anniversary.

747
00:53:53,110 --> 00:53:53,629
Shut up!

748
00:53:53,630 --> 00:53:55,704
Not in front of the collector.

749
00:53:56,380 --> 00:53:57,404
Look...

750
00:53:57,514 --> 00:53:58,947
Hanumanta is here.

751
00:54:00,050 --> 00:54:01,779
He got leave.

752
00:54:05,322 --> 00:54:06,550
Greetings, father.

753
00:54:06,657 --> 00:54:08,318
The Bhanwar Singh dispute is still on?

754
00:54:08,425 --> 00:54:10,825
The Collector is here to sort it out.

755
00:54:10,928 --> 00:54:12,520
Calm down, Hanumanta.

756
00:54:12,629 --> 00:54:15,393
The country needs you.

757
00:54:15,499 --> 00:54:17,558
Don't die for such petty issues.

758
00:54:17,668 --> 00:54:19,693
Shut up, will you!

759
00:54:19,937 --> 00:54:22,201
Respect the Collector.

760
00:54:23,507 --> 00:54:24,804
Bhanwar Singh...

761
00:54:25,509 --> 00:54:29,240
the papers prove Paan Singh's ownership

762
00:54:29,346 --> 00:54:30,540
on the land.

763
00:54:31,582 --> 00:54:33,846
You own enough land...

764
00:54:33,951 --> 00:54:36,249
stop fighting over such small issues.

765
00:54:36,353 --> 00:54:38,753
Solve this amicably.

766
00:54:38,855 --> 00:54:40,288
Sir...

767
00:54:40,357 --> 00:54:41,415
Sir...

768
00:54:41,558 --> 00:54:45,824
Sir, their family owns seven licensed guns...

769
00:54:45,929 --> 00:54:47,419
which they threaten us with.

770
00:54:47,531 --> 00:54:50,989
Please confiscate them till this problem is solved.

771
00:54:51,101 --> 00:54:53,968
I came here on Masand's request...

772
00:54:54,071 --> 00:54:57,905
but you have to resolve it amongst yourselves.

773
00:54:58,008 --> 00:54:59,942
You have the authority.

774
00:55:00,043 --> 00:55:01,874
They keep threatening us with their guns.

775
00:55:01,979 --> 00:55:03,503
An army man petrified by a gun!

776
00:55:03,614 --> 00:55:05,013
Let's fight without weapons then.

777
00:55:05,082 --> 00:55:07,281
This is the aggression of Chambal Valley.

778
00:55:07,282 --> 00:55:08,381
Solve it yourselves!

779
00:55:09,453 --> 00:55:12,388
Following your father's footsteps... are you?

780
00:55:13,023 --> 00:55:14,615
Your father never fought in a war.

781
00:55:14,725 --> 00:55:17,489
Since you're spoiling for a fight, listen to this.

782
00:55:17,594 --> 00:55:19,528
We have such a huge family that...

783
00:55:19,630 --> 00:55:22,531
we can drown you in our urine.

784
00:55:22,633 --> 00:55:24,464
Mind your language, uncle.

785
00:55:24,568 --> 00:55:26,001
Let's leave, Paan.

786
00:55:39,416 --> 00:55:40,781
Burn it all...

787
00:55:45,122 --> 00:55:48,216
It's Paan Singh's crop.
Burn it.

788
00:55:49,326 --> 00:55:51,419
Yes, keep burning.

789
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:19,111
I won't spare anything, damnit.

790
00:56:19,189 --> 00:56:21,020
Not a single grain

791
00:56:48,585 --> 00:56:50,052
You bastard!

792
00:56:57,294 --> 00:56:59,956
Where are you going?

793
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:07,042
Why are we exerting ourselves.

794
00:57:07,043 --> 00:57:08,870
Just shoot him!

795
00:57:09,206 --> 00:57:10,434
Let him go.

796
00:57:10,507 --> 00:57:11,184
Let him go?

797
00:57:11,185 --> 00:57:12,907
And what about his father?

798
00:57:13,009 --> 00:57:15,068
He can do nothing.

799
00:57:16,513 --> 00:57:19,710
But run to the police.

800
00:57:20,450 --> 00:57:22,918
That's all he can do.

801
00:57:23,019 --> 00:57:24,247
Run.

802
00:57:25,288 --> 00:57:27,688
If he had any guts...

803
00:57:27,791 --> 00:57:30,385
he'd have used the gun by now.

804
00:57:32,395 --> 00:57:34,863
Tomorrow, we shall get them all.

805
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:37,990
Let the whole village know who's boss.

806
00:57:40,737 --> 00:57:41,965
Who is that?

807
00:57:42,072 --> 00:57:44,131
Over there... who is that?

808
00:57:54,050 --> 00:57:55,642
Don't stop me today, father.

809
00:57:55,752 --> 00:57:56,741
Let me go.

810
00:57:58,955 --> 00:58:00,445
You don't have the courage...

811
00:58:00,557 --> 00:58:02,024
to resolve this farce.

812
00:58:02,826 --> 00:58:04,953
I will settle this with Bhanwar Singh.

813
00:58:05,061 --> 00:58:06,154
Put down your guns.

814
00:58:06,155 --> 00:58:07,996
Violence won't solve anything.

815
00:58:09,132 --> 00:58:11,657
It will not heal my son's wounds...

816
00:58:11,768 --> 00:58:14,498
What about our honour?
Our pride?

817
00:58:14,571 --> 00:58:15,787
What about it?

818
00:58:15,788 --> 00:58:18,132
We won't shed more blood.

819
00:58:18,809 --> 00:58:20,936
My son is an Army man.

820
00:58:21,578 --> 00:58:24,877
The Army considers me a national treasure.

821
00:58:25,549 --> 00:58:27,141
Won't the police listen to me?

822
00:58:37,727 --> 00:58:40,924
What's the proof that this is you?

823
00:58:42,499 --> 00:58:43,727
And what is this...

824
00:58:44,434 --> 00:58:46,425
Steeple... chase.

825
00:58:46,970 --> 00:58:49,438
- Chase?
- Yes, sir.

826
00:58:49,573 --> 00:58:51,734
So, who chases whom?

827
00:58:51,842 --> 00:58:53,901
There is no chase here, sir.

828
00:58:54,010 --> 00:58:57,741
This is a hurdle race, 3000 metres long.

829
00:58:57,814 --> 00:58:59,475
One has to jump across barriers...

830
00:58:59,583 --> 00:59:01,915
It is the most grueling race.

831
00:59:06,456 --> 00:59:07,889
How do we know it's you?

832
00:59:07,991 --> 00:59:09,356
Here is the proof, sir.

833
00:59:09,426 --> 00:59:10,984
This is me.

834
00:59:11,094 --> 00:59:12,356
This is me.

835
00:59:13,029 --> 00:59:14,326
This is also me.

836
00:59:20,370 --> 00:59:22,201
You were young then.

837
00:59:25,942 --> 00:59:29,901
Why do people abroad wear such skimpy clothes?

838
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:31,645
Well...

839
00:59:31,748 --> 00:59:34,239
You must have feast your eyes!

840
00:59:34,351 --> 00:59:36,148
How did you travel?

841
00:59:36,253 --> 00:59:38,915
By air, or by ship?

842
00:59:39,022 --> 00:59:40,903
This is no time for discussion.

843
00:59:40,904 --> 00:59:42,549
My son's life is in danger.

844
00:59:42,626 --> 00:59:45,823
I've won medals for the country.

845
00:59:45,929 --> 00:59:47,521
I've been the national champion.

846
00:59:48,899 --> 00:59:51,026
I've been in the forces, just like you.

847
00:59:51,635 --> 00:59:55,196
Neither the council nor the registrar is hearing my case.

848
00:59:55,305 --> 00:59:56,533
Where do I go now?

849
00:59:56,640 --> 01:00:00,599
Listen, this is a land and family dispute.

850
01:00:01,111 --> 01:00:04,569
Without a few dead bodies, how can we intervene?

851
01:00:04,681 --> 01:00:05,968
What I'm trying to say...

852
01:00:05,969 --> 01:00:07,616
This is Morena district...

853
01:00:07,684 --> 01:00:09,413
the police is revered here.

854
01:00:09,552 --> 01:00:10,610
I'm saying...

855
01:00:10,687 --> 01:00:13,918
What will people say if we meddle in petty issues?

856
01:00:14,024 --> 01:00:16,049
I'm not asking you to solve the land dispute.

857
01:00:16,159 --> 01:00:18,684
But they thrashed my son mercilessly...

858
01:00:18,795 --> 01:00:20,820
within an inch of his life.

859
01:00:20,931 --> 01:00:22,023
He can't move...

860
01:00:22,132 --> 01:00:24,157
But he's breathing, isn't he?

861
01:00:26,169 --> 01:00:27,966
He isn't dead yet.

862
01:00:28,071 --> 01:00:31,199
Should I wait till he dies?

863
01:00:31,308 --> 01:00:32,605
I have run for my country in vain!

864
01:00:32,709 --> 01:00:34,802
But you got your medals.

865
01:00:36,313 --> 01:00:37,678
Now get out of here.

866
01:00:37,781 --> 01:00:38,873
Get lost.

867
01:00:38,982 --> 01:00:40,142
Get lost.

So?

890
01:01:10,146 --> 01:01:11,841
Not to feast on their blood.

891
01:01:12,615 --> 01:01:14,276
What... what did you say?

892
01:01:15,118 --> 01:01:17,279
You heard it.

893
01:01:17,654 --> 01:01:19,281
Don't act like you can't hear me.

894
01:01:19,389 --> 01:01:21,755
You've got corruption written all over you!

895
01:01:22,625 --> 01:01:25,890
A pimp would do yourjob better.

896
01:01:25,996 --> 01:01:27,629
You bloody two-cent of a soldier.

897
01:01:27,630 --> 01:01:28,590
Son of a bcccc!

898
01:01:28,698 --> 01:01:30,325
Stop your crap... and get out.

899
01:01:30,433 --> 01:01:34,233
Do you want to be beaten up?

900
01:01:34,337 --> 01:01:38,205
I'll beat the life out of you!

901
01:01:38,308 --> 01:01:41,402
I'll rip that uniform off you.
Bloody pimp!

902
01:01:41,511 --> 01:01:43,069
Get lost!

903
01:01:57,127 --> 01:01:57,800
Where is he?

904
01:01:57,801 --> 01:01:59,652
Tell him to come with the guns.

905
01:02:00,563 --> 01:02:02,554
There will be a river of blood today.

906
01:02:02,665 --> 01:02:06,567
You are relaxing here and Paan Singh's gone to file a complaint.

907
01:02:06,703 --> 01:02:07,940
He's a stubborn man.

908
01:02:07,941 --> 01:02:09,672
We have to get rid of him.

909
01:02:09,773 --> 01:02:12,708
If he were a real man, he wouldn't keep running to the police.

910
01:02:17,747 --> 01:02:20,807
Beware, there'll be violence today.

911
01:02:24,054 --> 01:02:25,988
Bhanwar Singh is coming...

912
01:02:26,589 --> 01:02:28,523
Run...
Bhanwar Singh is here.

913
01:02:28,658 --> 01:02:32,685
With his cronies...
and they have guns.

914
01:02:32,762 --> 01:02:37,597
These bastards need...
to be taught a lesson.

915
01:02:37,734 --> 01:02:40,703
Do we have no pride that anyone
can walk in when father is out?

916
01:02:40,804 --> 01:02:41,793
Please don't go there.

917
01:02:41,905 --> 01:02:43,304
Wait, don't go.
- What's wrong?

918
01:02:43,406 --> 01:02:45,271
Where are you going with that gun?

919
01:02:45,375 --> 01:02:47,138
Mother... mother... hide.

920
01:02:57,353 --> 01:02:58,377
They are coming!

921
01:02:58,488 --> 01:02:59,921
Why did you have to shoot?

922
01:03:00,023 --> 01:03:01,149
Run to the roof.

923
01:03:01,491 --> 01:03:02,389
Break the door!

924
01:03:02,492 --> 01:03:03,291
Mother... hurry...

925
01:03:03,292 --> 01:03:05,154
You go, Bhanwar Singh won't hurt me.

926
01:03:07,130 --> 01:03:08,242
Come on, Bhanwar Singh!

927
01:03:08,243 --> 01:03:09,064
I'll teach you!

928
01:03:09,132 --> 01:03:12,158
Break it down before they run!

929
01:03:13,069 --> 01:03:14,229
Break it!

930
01:03:20,443 --> 01:03:21,842
Jump!

931
01:03:24,314 --> 01:03:26,305
Mother, this way...

932
01:03:26,616 --> 01:03:27,275
Run!

933
01:03:29,352 --> 01:03:32,378
What do you think you're doing?

934
01:03:32,489 --> 01:03:34,320
Have some respect.

935
01:03:34,424 --> 01:03:36,221
Get out of my house now!

936
01:03:40,897 --> 01:03:42,990
Old woman, where's your son now?!

937
01:03:43,099 --> 01:03:45,124
Help... help...

938
01:03:54,410 --> 01:03:55,843
It's a bad time.

939
01:03:56,012 --> 01:03:58,674
We need ward off the evil eye.

940
01:03:59,449 --> 01:04:01,440
We need to make offerings.

941
01:04:01,551 --> 01:04:03,485
And arrange a prayer in the village.

942
01:04:03,586 --> 01:04:05,554
Subedaar, don't go home.

943
01:04:05,688 --> 01:04:07,918
Bhanwar Singh and his family have attacked the house.

944
01:04:08,024 --> 01:04:09,082
There are bullets all over.

945
01:04:09,192 --> 01:04:10,887
The house is destroyed!

946
01:04:10,994 --> 01:04:12,689
They did not even spare mother.

947
01:04:13,163 --> 01:04:15,222
They are on the look out for you.

948
01:04:15,331 --> 01:04:16,229
Where is my son?

949
01:04:16,332 --> 01:04:18,766
Your wife has taken the kids to her mother's village.

950
01:04:19,102 --> 01:04:20,399
Is there anyone at home?

951
01:04:20,503 --> 01:04:21,765
No one.

952
01:04:37,687 --> 01:04:41,179
Mother asked me to give these bangles to you.

953
01:04:56,940 --> 01:05:00,068
Mother, till things cool down...

954
01:05:00,743 --> 01:05:02,404
we'll live here.

955
01:05:03,146 --> 01:05:05,046
Jairaj...

956
01:05:05,548 --> 01:05:06,459
Where are you going with the gun?

957
01:05:06,460 --> 01:05:07,209
I'm not going anywhere!

958
01:05:07,317 --> 01:05:09,717
Come back, I say!

959
01:05:09,819 --> 01:05:11,343
I'll be here.

960
01:05:12,155 --> 01:05:13,747
Look father is here.

961
01:05:21,731 --> 01:05:23,358
What do we do now?

962
01:05:24,601 --> 01:05:26,432
If we go back to the village we'll be killed.

963
01:05:27,103 --> 01:05:29,003
The police don't care.

964
01:05:30,573 --> 01:05:33,167
Will you lead the rest of your life at your in-laws'?

965
01:05:33,276 --> 01:05:35,267
We have to get back to the village...

966
01:05:35,378 --> 01:05:37,278
and the police better care.

967
01:05:39,382 --> 01:05:42,010
Hanumanta, you get back to duty tomorrow.

968
01:05:42,151 --> 01:05:43,083
I will not go back.

969
01:05:43,186 --> 01:05:44,244
Shut up!

970
01:05:46,222 --> 01:05:48,713
Your life has just started, son.

971
01:05:48,825 --> 01:05:50,918
I've lived mine already.

972
01:05:51,361 --> 01:05:53,761
You will join your unit tomorrow.
Say 'yes'.

973
01:05:55,665 --> 01:05:56,893
Yes.

974
01:05:58,134 --> 01:06:00,295
What about our unit, uncle?

975
01:06:00,403 --> 01:06:01,631
Our unit?

976
01:06:12,115 --> 01:06:14,640
Our unit leaves tomorrow morning.

977
01:06:32,201 --> 01:06:33,725
Take care of yourself.

978
01:07:38,534 --> 01:07:39,796
Move it...

979
01:07:51,847 --> 01:07:55,283
Mother's calling you, she is not well.

980
01:07:55,685 --> 01:07:57,050
Alright.

981
01:08:08,230 --> 01:08:10,323
They shot my son...

982
01:08:14,603 --> 01:08:16,865
Run...
- Where is Jigesh?

983
01:08:16,866 --> 01:08:20,303
- He has gone to his parent's place.

984
01:08:20,343 --> 01:08:21,594
I've been telling him...

985
01:08:21,595 --> 01:08:23,471
The cops will make your life hell!

986
01:08:23,546 --> 01:08:24,598
Listen everyone!

987
01:08:24,599 --> 01:08:26,045
- Let's go, brother.

988
01:08:26,046 --> 01:08:28,347
- This is Paan Singh Tomar's gang.

989
01:08:28,417 --> 01:08:30,908
I haven't settled my scores yet...

990
01:08:31,020 --> 01:08:33,449
and I won't rest till I do.

991
01:08:33,450 --> 01:08:34,979
I will be back.

992
01:08:35,291 --> 01:08:39,489
Bhanwar Singh, now the game has started.

993
01:08:42,498 --> 01:08:44,432
Why are you talking like this?

994
01:08:45,101 --> 01:08:45,633
Surrender!

995
01:08:45,634 --> 01:08:47,763
Serve your sentence and start coaching.

996
01:08:50,272 --> 01:08:54,072
I'm ready to come back but if I leave...

997
01:08:54,343 --> 01:08:57,801
my family and relatives...
no one will be spared.

998
01:08:59,548 --> 01:09:04,076
God and you know how much the game means to me.

999
01:09:04,453 --> 01:09:06,301
These cops and village council...

1000
01:09:06,302 --> 01:09:07,388
what do they know?!

1001
01:09:07,523 --> 01:09:10,720
They have created another rebel to run in the ravines.

1002
01:09:14,930 --> 01:09:19,264
These are my nephews...
they're innocent, sir.

1003
01:09:19,802 --> 01:09:22,362
Would you enlist them in the army...

1004
01:09:22,471 --> 01:09:24,166
Why don't you enlist them in your gang?

1005
01:09:24,273 --> 01:09:26,366
No one is a rebel by choice.

1006
01:09:26,475 --> 01:09:28,375
You and I will never meet again.

1007
01:09:34,550 --> 01:09:36,541
My news will keep reaching you.

1008
01:09:38,354 --> 01:09:41,118
Matadin is a pious fellow...

1009
01:09:41,223 --> 01:09:43,623
he can't kill a fly let alone commit a murder.

1010
01:09:43,726 --> 01:09:45,421
Bloody bastards...

1011
01:09:46,061 --> 01:09:48,996
Sir, listen to me...

1012
01:09:49,098 --> 01:09:51,258
I wasn't there at all.

1013
01:09:51,259 --> 01:09:52,534
It's a lie.

1014
01:09:52,635 --> 01:09:55,103
- Look.
- Inspector, please hear me out.

1015
01:09:55,171 --> 01:09:59,073
I'll let you go...
on one condition.

1016
01:09:59,175 --> 01:10:02,235
Tell me where I can find Paan Singh.

1017
01:10:02,344 --> 01:10:04,039
I swear, I have no idea.

1018
01:10:04,146 --> 01:10:05,545
They're lying!

1019
01:10:05,648 --> 01:10:07,082
They will not answer easily.

1020
01:10:07,083 --> 01:10:08,515
Make them sit on the stick

1021
01:10:08,584 --> 01:10:11,417
and they will start to sing

1022
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:13,010
Take them away!

1023
01:10:13,088 --> 01:10:15,079
I'm asking for the last time.

1024
01:10:15,157 --> 01:10:17,421
Where is Paan Singh?

1025
01:10:17,793 --> 01:10:20,159
Don't spare them!

1026
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:27,797
What can we say...
things are very difficult.

1027
01:10:27,870 --> 01:10:30,862
Bhanwar Singh has made our lives miserable.

1028
01:10:31,474 --> 01:10:35,467
The cops are questioning everyone about your whereabouts.

1029
01:10:35,578 --> 01:10:37,842
Where do we go now?

1030
01:10:39,482 --> 01:10:42,280
I've arranged for some police uniforms.

1031
01:10:42,618 --> 01:10:46,782
When Subedaar was looking for you, you were holidaying...

1032
01:10:46,889 --> 01:10:49,915
now that the cops have beaten you up you come whining.

1033
01:10:49,992 --> 01:10:52,119
Why should he take you into his gang?

1034
01:10:52,228 --> 01:10:55,664
- Let us join your gang.
- Please...

1035
01:10:55,764 --> 01:10:57,925
If you become a rebel you die.

1036
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,763
We're not living in any case.

1037
01:11:07,810 --> 01:11:11,211
Have you tried this with ice cream?

1038
01:11:11,313 --> 01:11:14,214
No, I haven't tasted anything like that.

1039
01:11:14,717 --> 01:11:16,708
Tastes like heaven!

1040
01:11:22,691 --> 01:11:24,022
Here, have some.

1041
01:11:24,093 --> 01:11:25,685
Come on!

1042
01:11:34,937 --> 01:11:36,404
The bowl is for you.

1043
01:11:39,675 --> 01:11:42,667
I've had ice cream in many foreign countries...

1044
01:11:43,312 --> 01:11:46,975
but the best is the German one.

1045
01:11:48,817 --> 01:11:50,648
One in six different colours.

1046
01:11:51,620 --> 01:11:56,353
And another one... you press a button
and the ice cream flows out like honey!

1047
01:11:56,759 --> 01:11:57,987
Softy.

1048
01:11:59,828 --> 01:12:01,557
You get it in Gwalior as well.

1049
01:12:02,298 --> 01:12:04,095
Don't talk rubbish!

1050
01:12:04,199 --> 01:12:07,396
No, no. 
You've come to the city after a long time.

1051
01:12:07,469 --> 01:12:08,993
You wouldn't know.

1052
01:12:12,074 --> 01:12:14,440
Did all your relatives join the gang?

1053
01:12:14,510 --> 01:12:16,000
Bhanwar Singh filed complaints...

1054
01:12:16,111 --> 01:12:17,976
against all of them there was no other option.

1055
01:12:22,184 --> 01:12:25,017
- How much is it for?
- What?

1056
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:27,748
- Softy.
- Two rupees fifty paise.

1057
01:12:28,057 --> 01:12:29,217
How much?

1058
01:12:29,325 --> 01:12:30,587
Two rupees fifty paise.

1059
01:12:32,761 --> 01:12:33,921
Two...

1060
01:12:39,301 --> 01:12:40,427
Where did you get your weapons from?

1061
01:12:40,536 --> 01:12:42,060
We bought them, obviously.

1062
01:12:42,438 --> 01:12:45,498
Your eyes are like a double barrel gun...

1063
01:12:45,608 --> 01:12:47,667
Your eyes are like a double barrel gun...

1064
01:12:47,776 --> 01:12:49,744
Your words are like a double barrel gun...

1065
01:12:49,812 --> 01:12:53,942
You give me a shock like a rifle...

1066
01:13:02,391 --> 01:13:07,124
You're an expensive weapon my darling...

1067
01:13:07,229 --> 01:13:08,389
Come here...

1068
01:13:10,699 --> 01:13:14,965
Happy Birthday to you...

1069
01:13:15,070 --> 01:13:16,744
Is singing all that she can do?

1070
01:13:16,745 --> 01:13:18,836
Depends on how much money you have!

1071
01:13:20,976 --> 01:13:22,307
Don't bother with this.

1072
01:13:22,411 --> 01:13:26,711
It's not nearly enough.

1073
01:13:27,983 --> 01:13:29,143
Go on...

1074
01:13:34,189 --> 01:13:36,714
Keep it going, I'll be back with the money.

1075
01:13:48,637 --> 01:13:51,128
One move and I'll give you a bullet for your birthday!

1076
01:14:00,949 --> 01:14:04,885
Oh my, a garland of notes.

1077
01:14:04,987 --> 01:14:06,921
Hey Balram, drop it.

1078
01:14:07,022 --> 01:14:07,750
You're a rebel.

1079
01:14:07,751 --> 01:14:09,013
Stop acting like a fool.

1080
01:14:09,091 --> 01:14:11,491
What will you do with that cheap garland?

1081
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:13,352
Ramcharan, come here...

1082
01:14:16,231 --> 01:14:17,926
Inform the boy's family...

1083
01:14:20,302 --> 01:14:22,167
and ask them for a ransom of 125,000 rupees.

1084
01:14:22,705 --> 01:14:24,502
And if they inform the cops...

1085
01:14:25,841 --> 01:14:27,809
he will lose his life.

1086
01:14:28,777 --> 01:14:29,937
Do you understand?

1087
01:14:30,679 --> 01:14:31,907
Say, 'understood'.

1088
01:14:34,049 --> 01:14:34,913
Brother...

1089
01:14:36,051 --> 01:14:40,044
Ask Govardhan, the barber to inform the boy's family.

1090
01:14:40,122 --> 01:14:41,919
- Right now?
- Yes...

1091
01:14:42,691 --> 01:14:44,181
You sit here, with me.

1092
01:14:46,628 --> 01:14:47,716
What are you doing?

1093
01:14:47,717 --> 01:14:49,893
Making sure he doesn't run away.

1094
01:14:51,433 --> 01:14:53,799
You think he can outrun me?

1095
01:14:55,404 --> 01:14:56,735
Get him to work.

1096
01:14:56,839 --> 01:14:59,967
There is no free lunch here he will have to cook for the gang.

1097
01:15:00,676 --> 01:15:02,041
So, tell me...

1098
01:15:02,144 --> 01:15:03,287
I dealt the cards.

1099
01:15:03,288 --> 01:15:04,874
It's your turn to play.

1100
01:15:04,980 --> 01:15:06,914
You call these cards?

1101
01:15:07,883 --> 01:15:10,078
I just taught you how to deal.

1102
01:15:10,419 --> 01:15:11,404
I have a hand.

1103
01:15:11,405 --> 01:15:13,445
You dealt a wrong hand.

1104
01:15:27,903 --> 01:15:30,347
Have you arranged the ransom?

1105
01:15:30,348 --> 01:15:32,465
I have 75,000 rupees.

1106
01:15:32,541 --> 01:15:35,713
It's 125,000 to free the boy.

1107
01:15:35,714 --> 01:15:38,673
But this is all I have.

1108
01:15:39,414 --> 01:15:42,508
You better shed tears worth 50,000!

1109
01:15:42,885 --> 01:15:46,981
If the Subedaar gets emotional, your son might be freed.

1110
01:15:47,055 --> 01:15:50,218
Everything depends on you.

1111
01:15:55,564 --> 01:15:57,098
That's not good.

1112
01:15:57,099 --> 01:15:59,591
You need to cry a river!

1113
01:16:14,416 --> 01:16:17,317
Make sure that the Subedaar doesn't get annoyed...

1114
01:16:17,820 --> 01:16:20,687
otherwise we aren't responsible for your life.

1115
01:16:21,423 --> 01:16:22,720
There he is.

1116
01:16:24,793 --> 01:16:26,385
Subedaar...

1117
01:16:29,431 --> 01:16:31,922
I couldn't arrange 125,000 rupees.

1118
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:35,163
I sold everything and managed 75,000.

1119
01:16:35,270 --> 01:16:37,329
You can check, if you want to.

1120
01:16:37,439 --> 01:16:39,669
He is bargaining for his own son.

1121
01:16:39,741 --> 01:16:42,301
Don't believe a word...
he is trying to dupe us.

1122
01:16:42,377 --> 01:16:44,504
We are rebels, not businessmen...

1123
01:16:44,580 --> 01:16:45,979
give us what you have and leave.

1124
01:16:46,048 --> 01:16:48,133
We'll release him in a week.

1125
01:16:48,134 --> 01:16:49,211
In a week?

1126
01:16:49,284 --> 01:16:51,184
Well, what if you turn informer?

1127
01:16:51,253 --> 01:16:55,246
I don't have the grit to inform the police.

1128
01:16:55,357 --> 01:16:57,848
Count the money, before taking it.

1129
01:16:59,161 --> 01:17:00,287
Get away.

1130
01:17:05,968 --> 01:17:08,027
Shall I tell him, where we found you?

1131
01:17:10,339 --> 01:17:12,985
He was busy with a nautch girl.

1132
01:17:12,986 --> 01:17:14,639
We caught him then.

1133
01:17:15,010 --> 01:17:17,979
Superb! So you enjoy dancing girls...

1134
01:17:18,046 --> 01:17:22,210
while I go bankrupt trying to save you.

1135
01:17:22,284 --> 01:17:23,717
Should I tell the Subedaar

1136
01:17:23,785 --> 01:17:25,275
about your misdeeds?

1137
01:17:25,387 --> 01:17:28,948
What about your mistress who you send...

1138
01:17:29,057 --> 01:17:30,931
10,000 rupees to every month!

1139
01:17:30,932 --> 01:17:32,288
Shall I tell him...

1140
01:17:32,394 --> 01:17:34,032
Subedaar, kill the bugger.

1141
01:17:34,033 --> 01:17:35,795
You want to argue with me!

1142
01:17:35,898 --> 01:17:37,798
You didn't even bring the entire ransom!

1143
01:17:37,866 --> 01:17:39,342
I'm your bloody father.

1144
01:17:39,343 --> 01:17:41,267
Bad excuse for a father.

1145
01:17:41,336 --> 01:17:43,497
Come here, boy.

1146
01:17:44,373 --> 01:17:46,068
Your tears won't help!

1147
01:17:46,174 --> 01:17:47,732
Wish you weren't my son!

1148
01:17:47,843 --> 01:17:49,310
Bring him here.

1149
01:17:49,378 --> 01:17:51,209
Subedaar, kill him.

1150
01:17:51,313 --> 01:17:54,043
- Move it!
- You can kill him.

1151
01:17:54,149 --> 01:17:56,515
You're playing games with me!

1152
01:17:56,585 --> 01:17:59,247
Your son is following in your footsteps.

1153
01:17:59,354 --> 01:18:01,288
What an interesting family!

1154
01:18:01,890 --> 01:18:06,122
Now, pay up 75,000 for your son and another 75,000 for your self.

1155
01:18:06,795 --> 01:18:10,196
Give me 150,000 and you can go.

1156
01:18:10,265 --> 01:18:11,857
But Subedaar...

1157
01:18:11,934 --> 01:18:16,234
If I decide to make you dance you'll be damned!

1158
01:18:17,940 --> 01:18:19,407
Tie both of them up!

1159
01:18:19,474 --> 01:18:22,739
This rubbish is spoiling the peace of the ravines.

1160
01:18:25,180 --> 01:18:30,709
We had an understanding with the border police.

1161
01:18:31,186 --> 01:18:34,349
As long as we didn't mess in their area...

1162
01:18:34,456 --> 01:18:36,390
they didn't trouble us.

1163
01:18:36,959 --> 01:18:40,588
We carried out so many kidnappings in collusion with the police.

1164
01:18:40,696 --> 01:18:42,323
On their instructions!

1165
01:18:44,299 --> 01:18:50,761
Om Prakash, the cloth merchant had lent me four thousand rupees.

1166
01:18:51,473 --> 01:18:54,465
But the interest exceeded the loan.

1167
01:18:55,344 --> 01:18:57,084
Sir, he's a big fish.

1168
01:18:57,085 --> 01:18:59,405
We should get hold of him.

1169
01:18:59,848 --> 01:19:02,612
My loan will get waived, and you will also benefit.

1170
01:19:02,684 --> 01:19:05,312
Is this a plan or an invitation from Death?

1171
01:19:05,387 --> 01:19:09,255
Sir, all I want is revenge.

1172
01:19:09,358 --> 01:19:12,657
Great! Your rivalry and our funeral pyre!

1173
01:19:12,728 --> 01:19:14,662
Don't listen to him.

1174
01:19:14,830 --> 01:19:17,799
He's made plans to get us killed in UP.

1175
01:19:18,700 --> 01:19:20,725
Our corpses will float in the Ganges.

1176
01:19:20,836 --> 01:19:22,565
Don't give us this nonsense.

1177
01:19:23,905 --> 01:19:26,772
Where is the full house you were mentioning?

1178
01:19:27,376 --> 01:19:28,604
Here's my last card.

1179
01:19:29,711 --> 01:19:31,076
It's my set!

1180
01:19:33,248 --> 01:19:36,615
We need to get past the police of three states.

1181
01:19:36,718 --> 01:19:39,778
Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan.

1182
01:19:39,888 --> 01:19:42,948
Exactly! He's got plans to get us killed.

1183
01:19:43,025 --> 01:19:45,357
Leave Rajasthan to me.

1184
01:19:45,460 --> 01:19:49,191
You think the cops of UP and MP will welcome us?

1185
01:19:51,633 --> 01:19:52,998
Arrange for a police jeep.

1186
01:19:53,035 --> 01:19:53,831
Done.

1187
01:19:53,902 --> 01:19:56,132
Who can drive well?

1188
01:19:56,204 --> 01:19:57,364
I can.

1189
01:20:03,845 --> 01:20:05,878
We are at the MP and Rajasthan border.

1190
01:20:05,879 --> 01:20:06,973
Hurry up and change.

1191
01:20:14,256 --> 01:20:15,814
Let them pass.

1192
01:21:04,906 --> 01:21:06,100
There are cops up ahead.

1193
01:21:06,208 --> 01:21:08,154
So what! 
We're officers.

1194
01:21:08,155 --> 01:21:09,371
Keep driving.

1195
01:21:22,324 --> 01:21:25,623
We've got a report, you're sheltering rebels.

1196
01:21:26,194 --> 01:21:28,287
Inspector, someone's misinformed you.

1197
01:22:06,535 --> 01:22:08,526
You aren't the police.

1198
01:22:08,603 --> 01:22:10,400
Correct, better late than never.

1199
01:22:11,072 --> 01:22:15,065
My name is Subedaar Paan Singh Tomar
and you have been kidnapped.

1200
01:22:15,143 --> 01:22:16,474
Say 'yes'.

1201
01:22:20,448 --> 01:22:23,144
You tricked the police of three states.

1202
01:22:24,019 --> 01:22:25,611
Must have created quite a scandal.

1203
01:22:27,589 --> 01:22:29,318
That's the pity!

1204
01:22:30,392 --> 01:22:34,852
I crossed 28 barriers and 7 water pits
to become the national champion...

1205
01:22:34,963 --> 01:22:36,191
Nobody cared.

1206
01:22:37,999 --> 01:22:41,025
But when I became a kidnapper and fooled the police...

1207
01:22:41,102 --> 01:22:43,764
everybody started chanting, Paan Singh... Paan Singh

1208
01:22:44,339 --> 01:22:45,601
I agree.

1209
01:22:47,075 --> 01:22:48,474
Sportspersons are not treated well.

1210
01:22:48,577 --> 01:22:50,545
Stop shedding crocodile tears.

1211
01:22:51,213 --> 01:22:53,078
If I was just an athlete...

1212
01:22:53,148 --> 01:22:55,309
would you have risked so much to interview me?

1213
01:22:56,651 --> 01:22:57,777
You are right.

1214
01:23:01,656 --> 01:23:04,352
Is it true you got 400,000 rupees...

1215
01:23:04,459 --> 01:23:05,892
for the Om Prakash kidnapping?

1216
01:23:08,330 --> 01:23:10,821
And then we became a complete gang.

1217
01:23:16,571 --> 01:23:17,690
Look at this one, brother.

1218
01:23:17,691 --> 01:23:18,766
I'm buying you a gun...

1219
01:23:21,076 --> 01:23:21,801
put this there.

1220
01:23:21,802 --> 01:23:23,636
Not this... it's for my prayers.

1221
01:23:23,745 --> 01:23:26,612
- Go, keep this there.
- Where?

1222
01:23:26,715 --> 01:23:28,148
There on the hillock.

1223
01:23:31,853 --> 01:23:33,252
If I need something else?

1224
01:23:34,356 --> 01:23:36,640
You'll get everything.

1225
01:23:36,641 --> 01:23:39,658
Guns, rifles, grenades, LMG, everything.

1226
01:23:39,728 --> 01:23:41,719
Put it there and move away.

1227
01:23:42,130 --> 01:23:43,258
There, I've kept it.

1228
01:23:43,259 --> 01:23:44,724
Okay, now move away!

1229
01:23:48,203 --> 01:23:50,433
Why are these guns numbered?

1230
01:23:53,275 --> 01:23:55,209
What's in a serial number?!

1231
01:23:56,911 --> 01:23:58,708
You have to keep track of the material.

1232
01:24:01,016 --> 01:24:02,244
It's good, isn't it?

1233
01:24:03,785 --> 01:24:05,650
There are no criminals in the army.

1234
01:24:06,821 --> 01:24:08,914
This perhaps belonged to a policeman.

1235
01:24:10,025 --> 01:24:12,598
It doesn't matter where it comes from.

1236
01:24:12,599 --> 01:24:13,654
I just sell it.

1237
01:24:13,728 --> 01:24:14,820
Subedaar...

1238
01:24:16,731 --> 01:24:18,995
You are all over the radio.

1239
01:24:23,038 --> 01:24:24,369
Turn it off!

1240
01:24:27,375 --> 01:24:30,242
When I brought laurels for the country nobody cared.

1241
01:24:30,312 --> 01:24:32,746
Now that I'm a rebel I'm famous!

1242
01:24:34,849 --> 01:24:36,316
Let me make this clear.

1243
01:24:38,953 --> 01:24:40,443
The bigger the gang...

1244
01:24:41,456 --> 01:24:42,980
the more the enemies.

1245
01:24:43,825 --> 01:24:45,588
Only two things can save us.

1246
01:24:46,194 --> 01:24:47,593
The first is...

1247
01:24:47,862 --> 01:24:49,693
our loyalty to each other.

1248
01:24:50,231 --> 01:24:52,096
And second, the support of our body.

1249
01:24:52,767 --> 01:24:55,099
Loyalty is our tradition.

1250
01:24:55,770 --> 01:24:57,738
And I'll train your bodies.

1251
01:24:58,506 --> 01:25:00,906
From tomorrow your military training begins.

1252
01:25:01,843 --> 01:25:04,107
- Say, 'yes'.
- Yes.

1253
01:25:07,315 --> 01:25:08,339
Yes.

1254
01:25:09,317 --> 01:25:12,445
I can't tell the difference between your yes and no.

1255
01:25:22,597 --> 01:25:24,258
Keep your head close to the ground.

1256
01:25:27,135 --> 01:25:30,366
A tortoise can easily win a gold medal against you.

1257
01:25:30,939 --> 01:25:33,305
You resemble a bunch of goats in a slaughter house.

1258
01:25:33,375 --> 01:25:34,774
Lift your gun higher!

1259
01:25:36,277 --> 01:25:39,007
Lmagine there is constant fire from here. You have to clear through.

1260
01:25:41,149 --> 01:25:43,208
So we need to learn the scout formation.

1261
01:25:43,551 --> 01:25:47,317
In this formation the first guy remains ahead...

1262
01:25:47,989 --> 01:25:51,755
while the second and fourth guys are at an equal distance.

1263
01:25:52,494 --> 01:25:54,826
Nobody will come in each others way.

1264
01:26:06,608 --> 01:26:07,632
Keep sitting.

1265
01:26:13,181 --> 01:26:18,118
I can't do this, Paan.
Forgive me.

1266
01:26:19,187 --> 01:26:20,810
I'm not cut out for this.

1267
01:26:20,811 --> 01:26:23,146
If I keep at it I'll die too soon.

1268
01:26:23,224 --> 01:26:24,691
Fine, come and sit here.

1269
01:26:27,328 --> 01:26:29,922
Uncle, what is the meaning of this parade?

1270
01:26:30,031 --> 01:26:31,760
While the enemy sleeps peacefully.

1271
01:26:32,367 --> 01:26:34,028
It's a temporary slumber...

1272
01:26:34,936 --> 01:26:36,267
What do you mean?

1273
01:26:36,371 --> 01:26:38,931
Very soon they will be sleeping permanently.

1274
01:26:39,441 --> 01:26:40,908
How much more time?

1275
01:26:41,443 --> 01:26:44,606
We have our own gang, our weapons.

1276
01:26:45,947 --> 01:26:47,812
All you say is, There is time...

1277
01:26:47,882 --> 01:26:49,611
It's not easy to attack them.

1278
01:26:49,684 --> 01:26:51,811
There are machine guns everywhere.

1279
01:26:51,886 --> 01:26:54,946
The house resembles a fort now with constant patrolling.

1280
01:26:57,992 --> 01:27:01,325
The soil's getting damp.

1281
01:27:01,996 --> 01:27:04,046
Sowing begins in a few days...

1282
01:27:04,047 --> 01:27:06,626
and crops don't grow inside the house.

1283
01:27:08,102 --> 01:27:10,366
They'll all come to the fields.

1284
01:27:14,075 --> 01:27:16,475
Isn't there any alcohol here?

1285
01:27:16,578 --> 01:27:17,562
All bars are closed.

1286
01:27:17,563 --> 01:27:18,842
All across the district?

1287
01:27:18,947 --> 01:27:22,144
I could have bought it from the market
but there'd be a rampage.

1288
01:27:22,217 --> 01:27:24,685
One shouldn't drink in the day.

1289
01:27:24,786 --> 01:27:26,276
I don't need your lecture!

1290
01:27:34,496 --> 01:27:35,827
What was that?!

1291
01:27:46,975 --> 01:27:48,237
It's an attack.

1292
01:27:48,510 --> 01:27:49,841
Paan Singh is back.

1293
01:27:50,278 --> 01:27:51,472
Come on...

1294
01:27:51,579 --> 01:27:53,137
Run... run!

1295
01:28:00,221 --> 01:28:02,314
Who's gang is this?

1296
01:28:02,423 --> 01:28:05,187
This is Paan Singh's gang, Inspector.

1297
01:28:06,794 --> 01:28:08,455
All of you, stand in a line.

1298
01:28:10,798 --> 01:28:11,992
No... No...

1299
01:28:12,133 --> 01:28:12,687
Why not?

1300
01:28:12,688 --> 01:28:14,693
He filed the wrong reports.

1301
01:28:14,802 --> 01:28:15,587
That's because...

1302
01:28:15,588 --> 01:28:17,066
He protects Bhanwar Singh!

1303
01:28:17,171 --> 01:28:21,835
He filed a complaint and I was only investigating it.

1304
01:28:21,910 --> 01:28:24,344
Inspector, you forgot your duty.

1305
01:28:24,412 --> 01:28:25,606
But I'm a rebel...

1306
01:28:25,713 --> 01:28:27,476
and I remember my duties.

1307
01:28:27,549 --> 01:28:30,541
You stand by justice, Subedaar.

1308
01:28:31,486 --> 01:28:33,716
I have two kids...

1309
01:28:33,788 --> 01:28:35,449
Kids?

1310
01:28:37,292 --> 01:28:38,623
Look...

1311
01:28:39,027 --> 01:28:40,790
This is your uniform...

1312
01:28:41,462 --> 01:28:43,020
and look at you.

1313
01:28:43,131 --> 01:28:46,464
You dare wear this uniform again...

1314
01:28:46,534 --> 01:28:49,162
and you'll die a dog's death.

1315
01:28:49,737 --> 01:28:51,728
You are not worthy of this uniform.

1316
01:28:52,874 --> 01:28:56,002
Apologize... to your uniform.
Now!

1317
01:29:00,782 --> 01:29:02,147
Please forgive me.

1318
01:29:02,250 --> 01:29:03,581
Not me... the uniform.

1319
01:29:09,223 --> 01:29:14,024
Dear uniform...
please forgive me.

1320
01:29:14,128 --> 01:29:16,062
You are not worthy of an apology either.

1321
01:29:16,164 --> 01:29:18,223
Now stand straight... stand up!

1322
01:29:21,336 --> 01:29:24,169
Run as fast as you can.

1323
01:29:27,875 --> 01:29:29,740
Where is Bhanwar Singh?

1324
01:29:34,148 --> 01:29:35,581
Here he is!

1325
01:29:43,191 --> 01:29:45,352
Where will you run to, Bhanwar Singh?

1326
01:30:24,432 --> 01:30:26,730
Where are you running off to?

1327
01:30:30,838 --> 01:30:32,772
Did you think you could out run me.

1328
01:30:36,277 --> 01:30:37,539
Tell me!

1329
01:30:40,415 --> 01:30:42,940
Where are your bodyguards?

1330
01:30:43,618 --> 01:30:45,813
And your licensed guns?

1331
01:30:50,692 --> 01:30:52,182
So, tell me...

1332
01:30:53,161 --> 01:30:55,322
all we had was a small piece of land...

1333
01:30:55,396 --> 01:30:56,920
and you had to go and occupy it?

1334
01:30:57,031 --> 01:30:58,396
Please forgive me.

1335
01:30:58,499 --> 01:31:00,524
Now how will you till the land?

1336
01:31:00,601 --> 01:31:03,399
You can take your land, take mine too...

1337
01:31:03,504 --> 01:31:04,710
Just let me go.

1338
01:31:04,711 --> 01:31:06,962
You thrashed my son...

1339
01:31:07,575 --> 01:31:09,440
till he was almost dead.

1340
01:31:09,610 --> 01:31:11,475
He was beaten to pulp!

1341
01:31:17,185 --> 01:31:19,278
What was my mother's fault?

1342
01:31:19,353 --> 01:31:21,651
That you hit her with the butt of a gun?

1343
01:31:23,791 --> 01:31:26,817
You beat my mother with the butt of the gun!

1344
01:31:28,730 --> 01:31:30,288
Forgive me, please.

1345
01:31:35,069 --> 01:31:37,594
I won't die with this bullet.

1346
01:31:37,705 --> 01:31:40,367
Please have some mercy.

1347
01:31:40,441 --> 01:31:42,966
You think I don't have enough bullets...

1348
01:31:43,077 --> 01:31:44,874
Or you think I can't aim?

1349
01:31:48,416 --> 01:31:50,407
You were my brother...

1350
01:31:50,485 --> 01:31:52,180
brother... my elder brother...

1351
01:31:52,820 --> 01:31:55,152
I was an international athlete...

1352
01:31:55,957 --> 01:31:57,049
Forgive me...

1353
01:31:57,158 --> 01:32:01,117
Tell me where I went wrong...

1354
01:32:01,195 --> 01:32:04,028
that you snatched my playing field from me?

1355
01:32:06,234 --> 01:32:09,362
You forced this gun into my hands.

1356
01:32:09,537 --> 01:32:11,698
And now I'm running laps in the ravines.

1357
01:32:15,309 --> 01:32:17,607
How will we settle this score?

1358
01:32:18,913 --> 01:32:21,575
I want my answers.

1359
01:32:26,921 --> 01:32:29,621
Please forgive me, Paan.

1360
01:32:29,622 --> 01:32:31,984
You are my brother.

1361
01:32:32,193 --> 01:32:33,660
Keep the gun away.

1362
01:32:37,031 --> 01:32:39,090
Please forgive me.

1363
01:32:41,335 --> 01:32:43,030
As a brother, forgive me.

1364
01:32:46,808 --> 01:32:48,571
I can run...

1365
01:32:49,443 --> 01:32:52,105
I've been running my whole life.

1366
01:32:53,614 --> 01:32:55,741
If that's fate, so be it.

1367
01:33:05,693 --> 01:33:07,684
Answer me before you go.

1368
01:33:08,329 --> 01:33:09,694
Answer me!

1369
01:33:15,536 --> 01:33:19,097
Why are you always in a hurry?

1370
01:33:20,842 --> 01:33:23,902
We were discussing something important...

1371
01:33:25,112 --> 01:33:26,443
and you had to intervene.

1372
01:33:27,648 --> 01:33:30,640
Drop your gun... now.

1373
01:33:36,657 --> 01:33:38,395
I'll get my answers...

1374
01:33:38,396 --> 01:33:40,923
when we meet in the afterlife.

1375
01:33:41,028 --> 01:33:43,622
My questions are still unanswered.

1376
01:33:46,367 --> 01:33:48,699
I had my revenge.

1377
01:33:50,104 --> 01:33:53,471
But in the ravines, enmity runs deep.

1378
01:33:55,176 --> 01:33:57,269
And then one day something happened...

1379
01:33:57,645 --> 01:34:00,739
because of which I am telling you my story.

1380
01:34:04,385 --> 01:34:08,617
Shut up!
Stop your ridiculous song.

1381
01:34:08,823 --> 01:34:12,259
The food better be spicy or off with your tongue!

1382
01:34:12,360 --> 01:34:14,692
Then you will be miming the song forever

1383
01:34:16,264 --> 01:34:19,529
Your trust is a great honour.

1384
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:22,125
The arrangements here are fantastic.

1385
01:34:22,236 --> 01:34:23,567
We have a big gang.

1386
01:34:23,638 --> 01:34:25,435
Whenever we pass by, we will come here.

1387
01:34:25,506 --> 01:34:26,234
Keep this.

1388
01:34:26,307 --> 01:34:28,400
- I cannot keep it.
- Keep it.

1389
01:34:28,476 --> 01:34:30,103
We have a big gang.

1390
01:34:30,177 --> 01:34:32,077
I don't want to become a burden on you.

1391
01:34:32,146 --> 01:34:34,478
What if you stopped respecting us!?

1392
01:34:37,852 --> 01:34:42,721
The word is that the Morena and Gwalior police is on the move.

1393
01:34:43,190 --> 01:34:44,248
It's dangerous.

1394
01:34:44,358 --> 01:34:48,226
We shall stay here until things settle down.

1395
01:34:51,933 --> 01:34:53,798
Come and get your lunch.

1396
01:35:02,677 --> 01:35:04,804
The women folk are coming here for their bath.

1397
01:35:04,912 --> 01:35:07,779
Would appreciate if you could all step outside.

1398
01:35:07,848 --> 01:35:09,179
You too, please step outside.

1399
01:35:30,805 --> 01:35:33,171
Try it, it's very sweet.

1400
01:35:37,144 --> 01:35:38,406
Don't pray so hard...

1401
01:35:38,479 --> 01:35:40,447
lest the almighty himself come down.

1402
01:35:42,183 --> 01:35:44,981
And asks you to accompany him back to heaven.

1403
01:35:56,831 --> 01:35:58,924
We've been betrayed.

1404
01:35:59,734 --> 01:36:02,100
Everybody take your position!

1405
01:36:21,689 --> 01:36:22,917
Give me cover.

1406
01:36:42,443 --> 01:36:43,637
What's wrong?

1407
01:36:47,114 --> 01:36:49,639
Balram, let the cattle loose.

1408
01:36:49,717 --> 01:36:51,150
Are you hurt, brother?

1409
01:36:55,156 --> 01:36:56,894
Where have you been shot?

1410
01:36:56,895 --> 01:36:58,284
My time is up.

1411
01:36:58,859 --> 01:36:59,711
You leave now.

1412
01:36:59,712 --> 01:37:01,293
I won't let you die.

1413
01:37:01,395 --> 01:37:02,953
My story is up.

1414
01:37:03,064 --> 01:37:04,998
I'll get you out of here.

1415
01:37:05,599 --> 01:37:06,793
Hold my hand.

1416
01:37:57,318 --> 01:37:58,842
Pull it, quick!

1417
01:37:59,053 --> 01:38:01,021
Quick, the cops won't swim across.

1418
01:38:03,390 --> 01:38:05,358
Mark my words!

1419
01:38:05,426 --> 01:38:08,224
Don't come any closer or you will be killed!

1420
01:38:34,855 --> 01:38:39,588
Three of our men have died.

1421
01:38:39,960 --> 01:38:41,951
Their bodies are with the police.

1422
01:38:46,233 --> 01:38:48,667
Inform their families and send them money.

1423
01:38:50,638 --> 01:38:53,869
Tell them, I'll come to meet them.

1424
01:38:55,543 --> 01:38:57,534
We have to do something now.

1425
01:38:58,779 --> 01:39:00,041
What!?

1426
01:39:00,347 --> 01:39:01,575
Uncle...

1427
01:39:01,916 --> 01:39:05,682
Till I don't burn down that village...

1428
01:39:06,253 --> 01:39:08,551
I will get no solace.

1429
01:39:08,656 --> 01:39:10,180
Come here, son...

1430
01:39:12,259 --> 01:39:14,591
He was a father figure to me too.

1431
01:39:16,197 --> 01:39:18,893
Save your anger for the last round.

1432
01:39:20,100 --> 01:39:24,503
We'll teach them such a lesson,
nobody in Chambal will dare betray us.

1433
01:39:36,483 --> 01:39:38,917
This is the gang of Paan Singh Tomar from Bhidosa.

1434
01:39:39,019 --> 01:39:41,180
We do not harm children and women.

1435
01:39:41,222 --> 01:39:42,780
But rest assured, the informer cannot escape.

1436
01:39:42,890 --> 01:39:44,517
You bloody bastard, come outside.

1437
01:39:45,759 --> 01:39:47,021
What are you doing?!

1438
01:39:47,094 --> 01:39:48,891
Don't stop me, Subedaar uncle.

1439
01:39:48,963 --> 01:39:51,295
I won't spare anybody in the village.

1440
01:39:51,398 --> 01:39:52,490
Stop talking nonsense!

1441
01:39:52,600 --> 01:39:53,624
Give me the gun.

1442
01:39:53,734 --> 01:39:54,996
Get back now.

1443
01:39:55,102 --> 01:39:58,230
Go and get the headman and his relatives...

1444
01:39:59,540 --> 01:40:01,201
Where do you think you're going?

1445
01:40:01,308 --> 01:40:02,605
Listen carefully.

1446
01:40:03,377 --> 01:40:06,039
This is the rule of Paan Singh's gang.

1447
01:40:07,748 --> 01:40:11,013
We don't spare the police and their informers.

1448
01:40:11,885 --> 01:40:13,853
But the poor and the innocent have

1449
01:40:13,921 --> 01:40:15,388
our complete protection.

1450
01:40:16,790 --> 01:40:18,257
Remember...

1451
01:40:18,826 --> 01:40:22,387
betraying us is an invitation to death.

1452
01:40:24,031 --> 01:40:25,760
Forgive me, sir.

1453
01:40:27,034 --> 01:40:28,934
What do you have to say now?

1454
01:40:29,003 --> 01:40:30,868
- Forgive us.
- Forgive?

1455
01:40:31,905 --> 01:40:34,271
Like a dog you betrayed us to the cops.

1456
01:40:34,375 --> 01:40:35,137
Say 'yes'.

1457
01:40:36,277 --> 01:40:38,370
- Say 'yes'.
- Yes.

1458
01:40:38,479 --> 01:40:40,674
You squealed and my pious brother...

1459
01:40:40,748 --> 01:40:42,477
paid with his life.

1460
01:40:42,549 --> 01:40:44,540
My mistake, forgive me.

1461
01:40:44,618 --> 01:40:46,609
How can I forgive you?

1462
01:40:46,720 --> 01:40:48,347
It was a mistake.

1463
01:41:17,584 --> 01:41:18,881
Satpal...

1464
01:41:19,286 --> 01:41:20,412
Satpal!

1465
01:41:22,890 --> 01:41:24,152
Yes, Sir!

1466
01:41:24,458 --> 01:41:25,992
Is this going to play all night?

1467
01:41:25,993 --> 01:41:27,154
Stop this blaring music!

1468
01:41:28,128 --> 01:41:29,595
Stop the music!

1469
01:41:30,331 --> 01:41:31,423
Just a minute.

1470
01:41:37,304 --> 01:41:40,831
Is your interview over?

1471
01:41:40,908 --> 01:41:42,739
- Yes, I'm done.
- Then go.

1472
01:41:45,412 --> 01:41:46,845
And one more thing...

1473
01:41:50,951 --> 01:41:52,111
Listen...

1474
01:41:52,953 --> 01:41:54,352
understand this...

1475
01:41:55,789 --> 01:41:57,916
it was necessary to kill...

1476
01:41:59,626 --> 01:42:01,560
those nine villagers.

1477
01:42:02,129 --> 01:42:03,528
If I didn't kill them...

1478
01:42:06,033 --> 01:42:08,433
They were unarmed but they were not innocent...

1479
01:42:09,002 --> 01:42:10,299
Yes.

1480
01:42:10,637 --> 01:42:13,834
Paan Singh is not a murderer.

1481
01:42:15,175 --> 01:42:16,369
I agree.

1482
01:42:20,914 --> 01:42:23,610
Will you be promoted for writing this story?

1483
01:42:24,785 --> 01:42:26,184
Yes.

1484
01:42:31,592 --> 01:42:34,322
Buy some sweets for your sister.

1485
01:42:36,163 --> 01:42:37,152
Go now.

1486
01:42:43,637 --> 01:42:46,071
There are so many journalists trying...

1487
01:42:46,173 --> 01:42:48,539
and you say you managed it

1488
01:42:48,642 --> 01:42:51,008
Did you really meet Paan Singh?

1489
01:42:51,078 --> 01:42:52,739
Or did you just cook this up?

1490
01:42:52,846 --> 01:42:55,076
Small town mentality!

1491
01:42:55,182 --> 01:42:56,911
We had dinner together.

1492
01:42:57,017 --> 01:42:58,882
See how this shakes the government.

1493
01:43:21,141 --> 01:43:23,575
What are you doing?
Move them aside.

1494
01:43:23,677 --> 01:43:24,632
You know these animals...

1495
01:43:24,633 --> 01:43:25,702
they'll move on their own.

1496
01:43:25,813 --> 01:43:26,513
What's the hurry?

1497
01:43:26,514 --> 01:43:27,872
Why are you peeping inside?

1498
01:43:27,948 --> 01:43:29,006
Move on... move on...

1499
01:43:29,082 --> 01:43:32,279
I'm checking if one round will be enough.

1500
01:43:36,256 --> 01:43:38,622
The killer of nine innocent villagers...

1501
01:43:38,725 --> 01:43:42,786
dacoit Paan Singh Tomar was sitting
in Gwalior, calmly giving interviews.

1502
01:43:42,963 --> 01:43:45,090
The opposition has slammed the government.

1503
01:43:50,704 --> 01:43:53,639
You didn't give us a chance to fire.

1504
01:43:53,707 --> 01:43:55,399
In this part of the world...

1505
01:43:55,400 --> 01:43:57,575
you shoot when you're in the mood.

1506
01:43:57,678 --> 01:43:59,305
I was in the mood today.

1507
01:43:59,379 --> 01:44:00,869
Open up the boot.

1508
01:44:04,251 --> 01:44:06,378
Inform his family.

1509
01:44:06,453 --> 01:44:07,078
Okay.

1510
01:44:07,187 --> 01:44:08,620
You can come out now.

1511
01:44:09,289 --> 01:44:11,587
Don't be scared, These are real cops in real uniforms

1512
01:44:11,658 --> 01:44:12,716
Step out!

1513
01:44:19,233 --> 01:44:21,963
Back here again?
Get your act together...

1514
01:44:22,035 --> 01:44:23,559
- Sir!
- Yes

1515
01:44:28,375 --> 01:44:31,276
Paan Singh rules the Bhind area...

1516
01:44:31,712 --> 01:44:35,079
but his family and gang members...

1517
01:44:35,148 --> 01:44:36,581
hail from Morena.

1518
01:44:37,117 --> 01:44:40,484
I want Paan Singh to surrender.

1519
01:44:41,121 --> 01:44:44,022
After all, he's been a national champion.

1520
01:44:45,259 --> 01:44:48,160
He used to win awards for the country...

1521
01:44:48,629 --> 01:44:50,358
now there's a reward on his head.

1522
01:44:50,964 --> 01:44:52,625
Some people are in the mood for

1523
01:44:52,699 --> 01:44:54,166
an encounter, not surrender.

1524
01:45:50,657 --> 01:45:52,522
How did this happen, sir?

1525
01:45:52,593 --> 01:45:53,787
What's there to say!?

1526
01:45:53,860 --> 01:45:57,159
We were on the lookout for Paan Singh's gang...

1527
01:45:57,230 --> 01:45:58,561
but got hold of another gang

1528
01:45:58,665 --> 01:46:00,599
now there is one less gang in the area

1529
01:46:06,573 --> 01:46:07,870
Greetings, Subedaar.

1530
01:46:19,152 --> 01:46:21,552
Ghesu and Pehelwan, come with me.

1531
01:46:26,860 --> 01:46:28,191
Paan Singh...

1532
01:46:29,129 --> 01:46:31,256
the cops are getting too close for comfort.

1533
01:46:31,932 --> 01:46:34,765
They killed ten members of the Setu Mallah gang.

1534
01:46:34,868 --> 01:46:40,101
The nine villagers you killed...
and that interview...

1535
01:46:40,207 --> 01:46:42,300
has aggravated the matter.

1536
01:46:42,409 --> 01:46:46,038
What is it that you want?

1537
01:46:46,480 --> 01:46:49,472
You are the cause of these problems.

1538
01:46:50,183 --> 01:46:51,946
If you surrender...

1539
01:46:52,953 --> 01:46:54,352
things will be fine.

1540
01:47:03,497 --> 01:47:04,862
I'm not afraid...

1541
01:47:06,566 --> 01:47:09,399
If you are, go surrender yourselves.

1542
01:47:09,503 --> 01:47:11,528
Don't be naive.

1543
01:47:12,305 --> 01:47:15,468
Surrender yourself and things will be fine.

1544
01:47:21,148 --> 01:47:22,308
Sir...

1545
01:47:23,150 --> 01:47:24,947
Have you ever run a race?

1546
01:47:27,320 --> 01:47:29,345
There is a rule in racing.

1547
01:47:30,557 --> 01:47:32,457
Once the race begins...

1548
01:47:33,560 --> 01:47:36,154
regardless of whether you win or lose...

1549
01:47:36,463 --> 01:47:38,431
you have to complete the race.

1550
01:47:39,232 --> 01:47:41,223
Over there on the horizon...

1551
01:47:41,334 --> 01:47:43,165
is the finish line.

1552
01:47:45,672 --> 01:47:47,105
You have to finish it.

1553
01:47:50,877 --> 01:47:52,681
Whether I win or lose...

1554
01:47:52,682 --> 01:47:54,711
I have to finish my race.

1555
01:47:55,315 --> 01:47:57,249
You think of yours.

1556
01:48:07,194 --> 01:48:09,458
What's the urgency?

1557
01:48:10,030 --> 01:48:12,658
I just feel like meeting them.

1558
01:48:14,101 --> 01:48:17,070
I don't want you to go alone.

1559
01:48:17,170 --> 01:48:18,694
The police is looking for me in the ravines...

1560
01:48:18,739 --> 01:48:20,263
but I'm going to town.

1561
01:48:22,709 --> 01:48:24,472
The police is looking for a whole gang...

1562
01:48:25,545 --> 01:48:28,013
so we cannot stick together.

1563
01:48:28,982 --> 01:48:32,349
We'll all disperse in groups of three or four.

1564
01:48:32,819 --> 01:48:34,116
Go far away from here.

1565
01:48:34,955 --> 01:48:37,753
We will meet a month from now at the Goraiyya river bank.

1566
01:48:37,858 --> 01:48:39,120
A month from now.

1567
01:48:39,893 --> 01:48:40,951
Beware...

1568
01:48:41,394 --> 01:48:45,490
don't trust anyone but your gang members.

1569
01:49:00,847 --> 01:49:02,644
Isn't this too high?

1570
01:49:02,749 --> 01:49:06,310
Paan Singh used to practice at this height.

1571
01:49:19,666 --> 01:49:21,224
Stay right there...

1572
01:49:21,768 --> 01:49:23,531
Your colleagues shouldn't get suspicious.

1573
01:49:23,603 --> 01:49:24,797
But, father...

1574
01:49:25,038 --> 01:49:28,940
Because now, I'm not just a father...

1575
01:49:32,746 --> 01:49:34,145
You look smart.

1576
01:49:36,449 --> 01:49:38,246
Like an army man.

1577
01:49:38,318 --> 01:49:39,683
You've become weak.

1578
01:49:40,987 --> 01:49:42,318
I've grown old.

1579
01:49:44,524 --> 01:49:46,355
I got word of your marriage.

1580
01:49:48,829 --> 01:49:52,822
The girl is from Jalaun.

1581
01:49:53,967 --> 01:49:55,696
Mother has approved of her.

1582
01:49:55,769 --> 01:49:57,066
She has four brothers.

1583
01:49:57,137 --> 01:49:59,128
I hope my reputation is not causing trouble.

1584
01:49:59,239 --> 01:50:00,934
They have agreed because of you.

1585
01:50:02,175 --> 01:50:05,338
No one in their family has had their pictures in the papers.

1586
01:50:06,513 --> 01:50:08,674
My disrepute is of some use then...

1587
01:50:10,150 --> 01:50:13,483
How is your mother?

1588
01:50:13,553 --> 01:50:14,986
She worries about you.

1589
01:50:16,189 --> 01:50:19,215
Tell her I'll be coming to meet her.

1590
01:50:20,527 --> 01:50:21,687
Okay.

1591
01:50:23,530 --> 01:50:24,758
Go now.

1592
01:50:25,699 --> 01:50:26,723
Go...

1593
01:50:50,357 --> 01:50:53,190
Will you get into trouble if you meet me?

1594
01:50:53,260 --> 01:50:55,023
If you are scared, I'll leave.

1595
01:50:55,095 --> 01:50:57,222
Who the hell is scared, damnit?!

1596
01:50:58,198 --> 01:51:00,189
- Why don't you do one thing?
- Yes.

1597
01:51:00,567 --> 01:51:02,797
Surrender yourself.

1598
01:51:04,571 --> 01:51:07,631
There's no other way out for you.

1599
01:51:07,741 --> 01:51:09,140
So I should accept that...

1600
01:51:09,242 --> 01:51:12,905
I made a mistake and seek forgiveness?

1601
01:51:14,547 --> 01:51:18,483
And be known as a surrendered rebel for the rest of my life.

1602
01:51:19,719 --> 01:51:23,382
Why don't you ask this of the people who make us rebels?!

1603
01:51:24,257 --> 01:51:25,815
Ask them to surrender first.

1604
01:51:25,892 --> 01:51:27,086
Then I will.

1605
01:51:35,268 --> 01:51:36,394
I am leaving now.

1606
01:51:36,770 --> 01:51:38,601
Don't mind me taking these.

1607
01:51:40,140 --> 01:51:41,664
I'm also taking this photograph.

1608
01:52:04,564 --> 01:52:08,295
So, why did you come here?

1609
01:52:09,402 --> 01:52:11,802
I missed your abuses.

1610
01:52:12,806 --> 01:52:15,400
Not sure if I will get another chance.

1611
01:52:17,610 --> 01:52:19,510
I missed you a lot.

1612
01:52:28,755 --> 01:52:29,847
Here he is.

1613
01:52:34,160 --> 01:52:35,718
Go ahead, eat some.

1614
01:52:39,599 --> 01:52:40,691
Janki...

1615
01:52:42,135 --> 01:52:43,432
this is for you.

1616
01:52:45,105 --> 01:52:48,768
What else has your astrologer predicted about my future?

1617
01:52:48,842 --> 01:52:50,639
He said you will surrender.

1618
01:52:51,778 --> 01:52:53,643
That's all he can say...

1619
01:52:54,014 --> 01:52:55,845
Surrender... surrender.

1620
01:52:55,949 --> 01:52:57,712
Do you know what it means to surrender?

1621
01:52:58,018 --> 01:53:00,953
He is just trying to please you.

1622
01:53:03,490 --> 01:53:04,650
Don't you worry.

1623
01:53:04,724 --> 01:53:07,557
This will settle down pretty soon.

1624
01:53:09,562 --> 01:53:11,325
When will you come again, father?

1625
01:53:12,499 --> 01:53:14,399
Whenever I happen to pass by.

1626
01:53:14,968 --> 01:53:16,435
Will you surrender yourself?

1627
01:53:16,503 --> 01:53:19,028
Your astrologer's definition of surrender is different.

1628
01:53:19,139 --> 01:53:21,607
We all have to surrender some day.

1629
01:53:39,559 --> 01:53:41,254
No, no... it's alright.

1630
01:53:42,462 --> 01:53:43,588
Get me some water.

1631
01:53:43,696 --> 01:53:46,460
We are a lowly caste, sir.

1632
01:53:46,566 --> 01:53:48,659
Caste and creed are not important.

1633
01:53:49,402 --> 01:53:51,495
We should help each other.

1634
01:53:52,639 --> 01:53:55,369
Customs which create such discrimination...

1635
01:53:55,475 --> 01:53:57,807
should be done away with.

1636
01:53:57,877 --> 01:53:59,174
Don't you agree!?

1637
01:53:59,479 --> 01:54:02,414
When have you been wrong?!

1638
01:54:06,352 --> 01:54:07,842
Tell me...

1639
01:54:08,755 --> 01:54:11,918
this boy Gopi from Paan Singh's gang, is this his wife's village?

1640
01:54:12,025 --> 01:54:13,219
Yes.

1641
01:54:13,793 --> 01:54:15,226
He comes here often?

1642
01:54:15,628 --> 01:54:17,323
Yes, he does.

1643
01:54:17,430 --> 01:54:19,455
He comes for social functions.

1644
01:54:19,566 --> 01:54:21,466
His wife lives here.

1645
01:54:22,068 --> 01:54:23,729
Get us to meet next time.

1646
01:54:26,206 --> 01:54:28,197
Would benefit both of you.

1647
01:54:28,308 --> 01:54:30,640
Will you enlist my son in the police?

1648
01:54:30,710 --> 01:54:32,541
Then it will benefit me.

1649
01:54:34,347 --> 01:54:36,042
Your wish is my command.

1650
01:54:37,016 --> 01:54:38,381
Won't need it now, son.

1651
01:54:38,718 --> 01:54:41,209
We'll celebrate your induction now.

1652
01:54:43,056 --> 01:54:43,931
It's important.

1653
01:54:43,932 --> 01:54:45,388
Should get sorted soon.

1654
01:54:46,059 --> 01:54:47,583
Sure. Will be done.

1655
01:54:49,929 --> 01:54:51,123
Goodbye, sir.

1656
01:54:58,004 --> 01:55:00,529
You are suddenly concerned about me.

1657
01:55:01,441 --> 01:55:02,373
Why?

1658
01:55:12,552 --> 01:55:14,884
And how would you do that?

1659
01:55:31,838 --> 01:55:33,635
I suggest we go to Rajasthan.

1660
01:55:33,706 --> 01:55:35,351
What's with Rajasthan?

1661
01:55:35,352 --> 01:55:37,369
Got a mistress out there?

1662
01:55:37,477 --> 01:55:38,307
We are not staying here.

1663
01:55:38,378 --> 01:55:40,642
We cross the border tonight and go to U.P.

1664
01:55:40,713 --> 01:55:42,510
What's the harm in staying a little longer.

1665
01:55:42,582 --> 01:55:43,879
Are you tired?

1666
01:55:43,983 --> 01:55:45,541
I've got some sweets for you.

1667
01:55:45,652 --> 01:55:47,142
We'll leave after eating it.

1668
01:55:47,520 --> 01:55:48,544
Hold on!

1669
01:55:51,925 --> 01:55:53,392
You eat it first.

1670
01:55:53,960 --> 01:55:57,123
Not this one, take this other one.

1671
01:56:02,302 --> 01:56:04,634
This can be easily eaten while walking.

1672
01:56:06,172 --> 01:56:08,470
Your mother-in-law made this for us?

1673
01:56:08,541 --> 01:56:10,242
No, there was a wedding in the village.

1674
01:56:10,243 --> 01:56:11,135
I got it from there.

1675
01:56:12,879 --> 01:56:14,073
Subedaar...

1676
01:56:14,480 --> 01:56:17,074
there is a rich party staying in the village.

1677
01:56:17,183 --> 01:56:18,207
It's a good opportunity.

1678
01:56:18,318 --> 01:56:20,479
We need to lie low for a few days.

1679
01:56:32,232 --> 01:56:33,631
What happened, sir?

1680
01:56:34,567 --> 01:56:38,799
People shouldn't think Paan Singh's gang is afraid of the police.

1681
01:56:38,871 --> 01:56:40,839
This news has reached the papers.

1682
01:56:41,841 --> 01:56:44,173
Gopi, is the party really loaded?

1683
01:56:44,244 --> 01:56:46,838
The wedding is next Saturday.

1684
01:56:47,180 --> 01:56:50,775
We can kidnap at least four or five people.

1685
01:56:51,417 --> 01:56:55,114
Sir, trust me, we should go to Rajasthan.

1686
01:56:55,221 --> 01:56:57,621
We'll take our catch and go to Rajasthan.

1687
01:56:57,724 --> 01:56:59,954
I refuse to be subdued by the police.

1688
01:57:07,934 --> 01:57:11,165
Gopi, can we trust your wife's family?

1689
01:57:15,174 --> 01:57:16,903
They gave me their daughter.

1690
01:57:36,596 --> 01:57:40,362
- Subedaar, lets stop right here.
- But why?

1691
01:57:41,100 --> 01:57:43,125
Looks like the Grim Repear.

1692
01:58:12,965 --> 01:58:14,626
- Gopi...
- Yes

1693
01:58:17,837 --> 01:58:19,998
Check if the coast is clear...

1694
01:58:20,506 --> 01:58:21,973
and bring the host here.

1695
01:58:22,041 --> 01:58:23,030
Okay.

1696
01:58:26,312 --> 01:58:27,336
Uncle...

1697
01:58:27,680 --> 01:58:29,113
I'm coming.

1698
01:58:29,849 --> 01:58:31,583
The gang's outside the village.

1699
01:58:31,584 --> 01:58:33,046
Subedaar's called for you.

1700
01:58:33,119 --> 01:58:34,865
Son, go inform the inspector.

1701
01:58:34,866 --> 01:58:36,088
I'll go get him.

1702
01:58:41,828 --> 01:58:43,227
This way.

1703
01:58:43,596 --> 01:58:46,087
You guys go ahead.

1704
01:58:46,165 --> 01:58:47,325
Govindram...

1705
01:58:49,535 --> 01:58:50,968
Are all the arrangements done?

1706
01:58:51,037 --> 01:58:54,234
I did my best to organize what I could.

1707
01:58:54,340 --> 01:58:55,705
The fellows are tired.

1708
01:58:55,808 --> 01:58:58,971
We'll stay here for the night and
leave early morning with our catch.

1709
01:58:59,045 --> 01:59:00,273
Okay.

1710
01:59:00,380 --> 01:59:01,438
Where is Gopi?

1711
01:59:01,547 --> 01:59:03,242
I'm right here.

1712
01:59:07,053 --> 01:59:09,078
Leave early for the catch.

1713
01:59:11,557 --> 01:59:13,650
Get them out on some pretext

1714
01:59:13,760 --> 01:59:14,988
Okay.

1715
01:59:31,077 --> 01:59:33,375
- You got the booze?
- Yes.

1716
01:59:33,479 --> 01:59:34,707
The food is ready.

1717
01:59:34,781 --> 01:59:36,408
You will have to eat it first.

1718
01:59:37,250 --> 01:59:38,717
What do we do about this?

1719
01:59:39,352 --> 01:59:40,944
I'll say that I've quit.

1720
01:59:41,053 --> 01:59:42,782
Or I'll find some excuse.

1721
01:59:42,889 --> 01:59:44,481
Have you checked the sedatives?

1722
01:59:44,590 --> 01:59:46,080
Yes I have.

1723
01:59:46,225 --> 01:59:47,915
Subedaar shouldn't get suspicious.

1724
01:59:47,916 --> 01:59:48,591
Or we're dead

1725
01:59:48,661 --> 01:59:50,128
You quit!

1726
01:59:50,229 --> 01:59:52,026
- Sir. I quit.
- Why?

1727
01:59:52,131 --> 01:59:54,827
I had TB last year.

1728
01:59:55,968 --> 01:59:57,833
- That's enough for me.
- That's it?

1729
01:59:57,937 --> 01:59:59,063
That's my rule.

1730
01:59:59,172 --> 02:00:00,975
Alcohol is good in small amounts.

1731
02:00:00,976 --> 02:00:02,300
After that it is poison.

1732
02:00:02,708 --> 02:00:03,675
Give some to everyone.

1733
02:00:03,743 --> 02:00:04,675
Pass around the alcohol.

1734
02:00:04,744 --> 02:00:05,773
Tell them to have some.

1735
02:00:05,774 --> 02:00:06,712
They'll sleep well.

1736
02:00:06,779 --> 02:00:07,711
Will you have some?

1737
02:00:07,780 --> 02:00:08,769
No, no.

1738
02:00:27,934 --> 02:00:30,664
Life was a barren land.

1739
02:00:30,736 --> 02:00:33,364
Filled with loneliness and sorrow...

1740
02:00:34,740 --> 02:00:36,469
Till I met you

1741
02:00:36,576 --> 02:00:40,376
- Then?
- The rest of my life got screwed

1742
02:00:41,314 --> 02:00:42,838
Uncle...

1743
02:00:46,319 --> 02:00:48,150
- What happened?!
- I told you!

1744
02:00:48,221 --> 02:00:49,313
That death is in the air.

1745
02:00:49,388 --> 02:00:51,015
The bloody cops have surrounded the entire village.

1746
02:00:51,090 --> 02:00:52,853
- The cops are here?
- Yes.

1747
02:00:53,493 --> 02:00:55,051
Give me my gun.

1748
02:00:55,161 --> 02:00:58,426
- Govindram!
- Yes, sir.

1749
02:00:58,898 --> 02:01:00,058
Who informed the cops?
Tell me who.

1750
02:01:00,132 --> 02:01:02,623
I don't know sir.
Not me sir.

1751
02:01:02,735 --> 02:01:04,032
Tell me who.

1752
02:01:04,103 --> 02:01:05,730
I didn't do it.

1753
02:01:05,805 --> 02:01:07,568
Trust me, I didn't inform on you.

1754
02:01:08,508 --> 02:01:10,738
I don't want to go to hell.

1755
02:01:10,810 --> 02:01:12,573
I was...

1756
02:01:12,645 --> 02:01:14,044
I am obliged to you.

1757
02:01:14,146 --> 02:01:15,704
Where is the police?

1758
02:01:15,815 --> 02:01:17,009
At the canal.

1759
02:01:17,116 --> 02:01:18,447
Let the cattle loose!

1760
02:01:18,518 --> 02:01:21,316
The cop manning the LMG won't hesitate to shoot them.

1761
02:01:21,821 --> 02:01:22,515
Call Gopi.

1762
02:01:22,588 --> 02:01:25,113
The bag of bullets is with him.

1763
02:01:25,191 --> 02:01:26,249
He has the bullets?

1764
02:01:26,325 --> 02:01:28,850
He ran away in the nick of time.

1765
02:01:29,662 --> 02:01:30,959
How many cops are there?

1766
02:01:31,030 --> 02:01:32,019
About 500.

1767
02:01:32,131 --> 02:01:34,531
There's only one way out of the village and that's where the cops are.

1768
02:01:34,634 --> 02:01:36,192
We have to escape from there.

1769
02:01:36,669 --> 02:01:37,533
Get the megaphone.

1770
02:01:37,670 --> 02:01:39,069
It's ready!

1771
02:01:39,872 --> 02:01:41,271
We leave this way.

1772
02:01:42,441 --> 02:01:43,408
Where's my gun?!

1773
02:01:43,509 --> 02:01:45,500
Everyone go towards the canal.

1774
02:01:45,545 --> 02:01:47,342
Stay together.

1775
02:01:47,413 --> 02:01:49,108
We move ahead in a scout formation.

1776
02:01:49,215 --> 02:01:51,080
Keep moving in this formation.

1777
02:02:32,858 --> 02:02:34,325
He's been shot.

1778
02:02:35,962 --> 02:02:37,122
Get down!

1779
02:02:56,248 --> 02:02:57,977
Don't shoot me.

1780
02:02:58,084 --> 02:03:00,609
I'm the informer Gopi!

1781
02:03:00,720 --> 02:03:01,618
Bloody traitor

1782
02:03:01,721 --> 02:03:03,245
Don't shoot.

1783
02:03:03,322 --> 02:03:05,119
Hold your fire!

1784
02:03:24,276 --> 02:03:25,743
Somebody man the LMG.

1785
02:03:28,781 --> 02:03:31,113
- Who got shot?
- Govind.

1786
02:03:31,283 --> 02:03:33,148
- Where?
- He's dead.

1787
02:03:40,526 --> 02:03:44,519
There's only one way out.

1788
02:03:50,236 --> 02:03:52,067
We have to cross the canal.

1789
02:03:52,772 --> 02:03:54,467
That's my route.

1790
02:03:55,041 --> 02:03:56,099
They will attack me...

1791
02:03:56,208 --> 02:03:58,301
Try running away through the fields!

1792
02:03:59,378 --> 02:04:01,107
Subedaar...
What's the matter, Subedaar?

1793
02:04:01,180 --> 02:04:04,775
I think the bastard poisoned the drinks.

1794
02:04:06,986 --> 02:04:08,681
Subedaar...

1795
02:04:09,221 --> 02:04:10,347
Subedaar...

1796
02:04:10,456 --> 02:04:12,321
Are you feeling drugged, Jigesh?

1797
02:04:14,060 --> 02:04:15,687
Where are you going?

1798
02:04:16,362 --> 02:04:17,761
Where are you going?

1799
02:04:30,142 --> 02:04:31,370
Subedaar...

1800
02:04:33,646 --> 02:04:34,840
Subedaar...

1801
02:05:23,662 --> 02:05:26,222
Inform the CM that the operation is a success.

1802
02:05:26,899 --> 02:05:28,696
Go and count the bodies.

1803
02:05:29,335 --> 02:05:31,530
We are yet to find Paan Singh's body.

1804
02:05:33,205 --> 02:05:35,537
Go and find him...

1805
02:05:36,142 --> 02:05:41,170
Subedaar, it's all over.
Everyone's dead.

1806
02:05:44,617 --> 02:05:47,142
- You are still alive Ramcharan.
- Yes.

1807
02:05:50,723 --> 02:05:52,623
There lies the finish line.

1808
02:05:55,461 --> 02:05:58,157
The canal is the final hurdle.

1809
02:06:03,769 --> 02:06:05,669
Tell people my story.

1810
02:06:07,273 --> 02:06:11,369
That Paan Singh finished his race.

1811
02:06:12,378 --> 02:06:14,278
He did not surrender.

1812
02:06:15,147 --> 02:06:17,172
We shall meet again.

1813
02:06:26,225 --> 02:06:27,556
Ramcharan!

1814
02:06:48,581 --> 02:06:51,607
Listen here, corrupt inspector...

1815
02:06:53,118 --> 02:06:55,348
This gang isn't finished yet.

1816
02:06:56,155 --> 02:06:58,248
Paan Singh is alive.

1817
02:06:58,958 --> 02:07:00,983
And he will never surrender!

1818
02:07:02,228 --> 02:07:07,029
Many before you tried to catch me but failed miserably.

1819
02:07:07,366 --> 02:07:09,129
And you think you will?!

1820
02:07:09,802 --> 02:07:12,498
Bring in some more battalions to help you...

1821
02:07:14,173 --> 02:07:16,539
try and capture Paan Singh!
