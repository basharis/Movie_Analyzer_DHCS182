1
00:01:49,055 --> 00:01:51,523
How many stars
sparkle in the sky?

2
00:01:51,925 --> 00:01:54,359
Ever tried counting them?

3
00:01:54,828 --> 00:02:02,291
lt would take 6,000 years to
count those in our galaxy alone

4
00:02:02,803 --> 00:02:04,930
How many such galaxies exist?

5
00:02:05,338 --> 00:02:08,967
Scientists reckon
two billion more

6
00:02:09,476 --> 00:02:14,709
lsn't it possible that amongst
these billions of celestial bodies

7
00:02:14,981 --> 00:02:18,473
a planet with people
like us exists?

8
00:02:18,819 --> 00:02:22,585
As we explore space
looking for them,

9
00:02:22,856 --> 00:02:27,293
couldn't they be coming here,
looking for us?

10
00:04:27,781 --> 00:04:58,375
Hindi pop song

11
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:21,318
What the thief stole was the
gadget to recall his spaceship

12
00:06:21,494 --> 00:06:24,986
Without this remote
he could not return home

13
00:06:25,432 --> 00:06:29,766
He neither knew our language,
nor had a friend here

14
00:06:30,003 --> 00:06:33,962
Alone, anguished,
his only thought was...

15
00:06:34,441 --> 00:06:36,341
.. how will l return home?

16
00:06:59,032 --> 00:07:04,231
On the pathway of Time
Life is but a brief flame

17
00:07:05,238 --> 00:07:10,301
ln its luminous mist
We wish, we dream, we exist

18
00:07:10,777 --> 00:07:13,541
But on a beautiful bend

19
00:07:13,847 --> 00:07:16,577
A stranger may we meet

20
00:07:16,783 --> 00:07:19,809
Life after life

21
00:07:19,986 --> 00:07:23,251
Whose memory may persist

22
00:07:42,275 --> 00:07:44,004
Extra ticket.
Anyone extra ticket?

23
00:07:44,277 --> 00:07:46,472
- Yes sir...
- I'II take it!

24
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,941
Sorry, I raised my hand first

25
00:07:49,015 --> 00:07:51,779
But I caIIed out first

26
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:54,887
I'm a big fan of
Mr Bachchan, the poet

27
00:07:54,954 --> 00:07:57,718
I'm a bigger fan of his son,
the actor

28
00:07:57,991 --> 00:08:00,789
From age ten, I know aII his poems.
FuIIy memorized

29
00:08:01,227 --> 00:08:04,219
From age five, I know his son's
diaIogues - without memorizing

30
00:08:04,264 --> 00:08:05,959
HeIIo, who wants it?

31
00:08:06,366 --> 00:08:08,698
Give me.
Poetry's not his cup of tea

32
00:08:08,968 --> 00:08:10,265
€100

33
00:08:10,703 --> 00:08:14,230
€100 for a €40 ticket?
BIack market of poetry!

34
00:08:14,374 --> 00:08:16,433
Queued up
six Iong hours for this

35
00:08:16,676 --> 00:08:17,904
Time is money

36
00:08:24,884 --> 00:08:29,719
- Go for the diaIogues.
- AII yours. Ladies first

37
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:33,520
Just a sec!
Why not spIit the ticket?

38
00:08:33,793 --> 00:08:40,562
1st haIf you enjoy the poetry.
2nd haIf I'II savor the acting

39
00:08:41,868 --> 00:08:44,268
That's a damn good idea!

40
00:08:46,539 --> 00:08:48,336
10, 20, 30, 40

41
00:08:48,408 --> 00:08:48,999

ScoundreI!
Giving India a bad name

54

60
00:09:59,812 --> 00:10:01,006

Decaying dacoit!
SeniIe snake! CapitaIist!

00:10:16,629 --> 00:10:18,893

68

Let's get outta here

I'II get you for this!

70
00:10:25,772 --> 00:10:28,002
Don't chase me...

71
00:10:42,021 --> 00:10:45,354
OIdies these days!
It's a spoiIt generation!

72
00:10:45,591 --> 00:10:48,424
Forget it

73
00:10:48,661 --> 00:10:49,628
How can I?

74
00:10:50,063 --> 00:10:52,531
That bandit basks in poetry
and here I am

75
00:10:52,598 --> 00:10:53,587
Drop it

76
00:10:55,335 --> 00:10:58,327
Why pine for the party
that shuns us?

77
00:10:58,604 --> 00:11:01,767
Follow the moment
that beckons us

78
00:11:02,275 --> 00:11:04,436
I too dabbIe in poetry

79
00:11:04,711 --> 00:11:06,508
It's nice. Go on

80
00:11:07,747 --> 00:11:13,549
No. If I go on,
you'II propose to me

81
00:11:14,821 --> 00:11:16,812
- You crazy?
- I mean it!

82
00:11:17,523 --> 00:11:19,354
Your favorite poet,
senior Mr Bachchan

83
00:11:19,525 --> 00:11:22,289
met a Iady one morning,
wooed her with verse

84
00:11:22,595 --> 00:11:24,859
By dusk they were married.
So I've read

85
00:11:25,031 --> 00:11:26,396
ReaIIy?

86
00:11:26,766 --> 00:11:29,462
And boy!
Look what they produced -

87
00:11:29,736 --> 00:11:31,829
Amitabh Bachchan -
the great actor

88
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:34,638
Jaggu

89
00:11:35,308 --> 00:11:36,036
Jaggu?

90
00:11:36,776 --> 00:11:37,765
My name

91
00:11:38,011 --> 00:11:41,378
Papa named me Jagat Janani:
world's mother

92
00:11:41,681 --> 00:11:45,674
I got mocked at schooI
so I shortened it - Jaggu

93
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:47,748
- From Mumbai?
- No. DeIhi

94
00:11:47,954 --> 00:11:49,683
I'm studying TV production

95
00:11:49,822 --> 00:11:50,880
And you?

96
00:11:51,324 --> 00:11:53,986
Sarfaraz. I study architecture

97
00:11:54,694 --> 00:11:57,356
and work part time
at the Pakistan Embassy

98
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:59,664
Pakistan Embassy? Why?

99
00:12:00,033 --> 00:12:02,263
WeII, I'm from Pakistan

100
00:12:02,468 --> 00:12:05,904
UnIikeIy the Indian Embassy
wiII empIoy me!

101
00:12:08,408 --> 00:12:09,739
What's wrong?

102
00:12:10,443 --> 00:12:11,705
Nothing

103
00:12:15,515 --> 00:12:20,543
My being from Pakistan
perturbs you?

104
00:12:22,889 --> 00:12:24,550
AIright then

105
00:12:24,991 --> 00:12:26,925
Goodbye

106
00:12:42,542 --> 00:12:48,606
Ask not my name,
nor my country

107
00:12:49,449 --> 00:12:54,978
From bondage of
borders break free

108
00:12:56,022 --> 00:13:01,551
A few steps
on this brief journey

109
00:13:02,295 --> 00:13:07,494
Come,
just walk with me

110
00:13:17,577 --> 00:13:21,308
Ask not my name,
nor my country

111
00:13:21,681 --> 00:13:24,741
From bondage of
borders break free

112
00:13:25,551 --> 00:13:29,419
A few steps
on this brief journey

113
00:13:29,755 --> 00:13:32,883
Come,
just walk with me

114
00:13:33,726 --> 00:13:37,321
Past the realms of
word and speech

115
00:13:37,763 --> 00:13:40,755
Hand in hand,
nowhere to reach

116
00:13:41,767 --> 00:13:45,294
A few steps
on this brief journey

117
00:13:45,771 --> 00:13:48,501
Come,
just walk with me

118
00:13:49,308 --> 00:13:53,039
Past the realms of
word and speech

119
00:13:53,813 --> 00:13:56,873
Hand in hand,
nowhere to reach

120
00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:01,511
A few steps
on this brief journey

121
00:14:01,854 --> 00:14:05,756
Come,
just walk with me

122
00:14:25,845 --> 00:14:29,576
lf the sun scorches
the pathway

123
00:14:29,882 --> 00:14:33,318
A carpet of shade
will l lay

124
00:14:33,786 --> 00:14:37,586
lf darkness
fills you with dismay

125
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:41,485
l'll conjure up
a moon in the sky

126
00:14:41,894 --> 00:14:45,591
lf dejection fills up
your day

127
00:14:45,932 --> 00:14:49,459
With laughter
l'll shoo it away

128
00:14:49,936 --> 00:14:53,633
Laughing, frolicking,
humming a song

129
00:14:53,906 --> 00:14:57,398
Together we shall
walk along

130
00:15:15,728 --> 00:15:19,357
With you,
my fellow traveler

131
00:15:19,699 --> 00:15:22,566
Nothing in this world l fear

132
00:15:23,603 --> 00:15:27,539
Why a few steps,
a whole lifelong

133
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:30,903
With you l'll walk along

134
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:35,378
Past the realms of
word and speech

135
00:15:35,681 --> 00:15:38,946
Hand in hand,
nowhere to reach

136
00:15:39,685 --> 00:15:43,416
A few steps
on this brief journey

137
00:15:43,723 --> 00:15:47,523
Come,
just walk with me

138
00:16:29,268 --> 00:16:31,259
- Thank you
- Thank you

139
00:16:32,405 --> 00:16:33,429
Mom!

140
00:16:33,506 --> 00:16:34,370
Papa!

141
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,907
She's faIIen in Iove!

142
00:16:36,475 --> 00:16:38,636
FaIIen in Iove?

143
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:40,404
He's so cute!

144
00:16:40,813 --> 00:16:41,973
More photos pIease!

145
00:16:42,448 --> 00:16:44,939
What's his job?
What's his famiIy Iike?

146
00:16:45,584 --> 00:16:47,484
CaIm down Mom.
I'II teII you

147
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,711
First, the name

148
00:16:50,022 --> 00:16:51,580
Sarfaraz

149
00:16:51,957 --> 00:16:53,788
MusIim?

150
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:58,293
Yes. Studies architecture.
FamiIy is in Pakistan

151
00:16:58,464 --> 00:17:00,694
Pakistan!
Which Pakistan?

152
00:17:00,933 --> 00:17:02,491
There's just
one Pakistan, Mom

153
00:17:02,702 --> 00:17:03,566
You'II wear burkhas?

154
00:17:03,836 --> 00:17:05,861
Read the Quran?
Have you gone mad?

155
00:17:06,005 --> 00:17:08,872
Don't you disconnect.
Stay put

156
00:17:09,241 --> 00:17:10,503
Start the car

157
00:17:10,776 --> 00:17:12,744
AII's doomed, Your HoIiness.
HeIp!

158
00:17:13,312 --> 00:17:15,803
l knew exactly
where Papa was headed

159
00:17:16,248 --> 00:17:20,617
Since childhood one face had
surrounded us.: His Holiness

160
00:17:20,786 --> 00:17:22,447
Bye Mom

161
00:17:23,255 --> 00:17:25,917
From bags to bathroom walls,

162
00:17:26,325 --> 00:17:29,317
he was omnipresent

163
00:17:30,396 --> 00:17:35,265
Even for a root canal
he would set the auspicious time

164
00:17:36,769 --> 00:17:41,729
He had gifted Papa a God box
with a deity for every task

165
00:17:42,808 --> 00:17:46,710
Goddess of Wealth
for the stock market

166
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:51,773
God of Health for workouts

167
00:17:52,418 --> 00:17:55,615
Web-based worship and
sacred sweets by courier

168
00:17:55,821 --> 00:17:59,882
were his innovations

169
00:18:03,796 --> 00:18:06,822
HaiI, Your HoIiness

170
00:18:08,868 --> 00:18:10,358
HaiI, Your HoIiness

171
00:18:12,438 --> 00:18:14,804
Touch his feet Jaggu

172
00:18:24,417 --> 00:18:28,251
Why this fataI infatuation?

173
00:18:28,587 --> 00:18:31,818
Pick up a pen and write

174
00:18:32,324 --> 00:18:33,621
God

175
00:18:34,593 --> 00:18:36,390
EnIighten me

176
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,558
Yes...

177
00:18:43,969 --> 00:18:45,300
Yes...

178
00:18:46,338 --> 00:18:48,670
Your wish is our command

179
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:51,343
Write down the prophecy

180
00:18:51,644 --> 00:18:53,703
This Pakistani boy,

181
00:18:53,979 --> 00:18:55,571

I know he won't

184
00:19:02,288 --> 00:19:08,693
History stands witness:
these peopIe scheme and betray

185
00:19:08,894 --> 00:19:12,557
He wiII pursue
carnaI pIeasures

186

But wiII never marry you.
He'II vanish

187
00:19:16,302 --> 00:19:20,898
Come home now! One more
night there, and you're dead to us

188
00:19:20,973 --> 00:19:23,908
Mr Sahni,
I'II taIk to her

189
00:19:24,477 --> 00:19:27,935
ChiId, hit the deIete button

190
00:19:28,514 --> 00:19:31,506
Banish him
from your system

191
00:19:35,721 --> 00:19:37,279
HeIIo!

192
00:19:39,558 --> 00:19:40,923
What happened?

193
00:19:42,528 --> 00:19:44,291
Do you Iove me?

194
00:19:44,797 --> 00:19:46,458
Of course I do. Why?

195
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:50,268
- WiII you marry me?
- What's the matter?

196
00:19:50,402 --> 00:19:51,391
Yes or no, Sarfaraz?

197
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:53,570
- Yes, but...
- Tomorrow

198
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:54,806
Tomorrow?

199
00:19:55,508 --> 00:19:57,635
Tomorrow we get married

200
00:19:58,811 --> 00:20:02,338
His prophecy is wrong.
I'II prove it

201
00:20:15,528 --> 00:20:18,520
Mr James Herrick and
Miss Oprah Brown, you're next

202
00:20:18,797 --> 00:20:21,732
- James isn't here, yet.
- Oh, taIk to the registrar

203
00:20:22,701 --> 00:20:24,498
CouId you just
hoId this pIease?

204
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:25,964
- Yes of course.
- Thank you

205
00:20:27,439 --> 00:20:28,701
HeIIo...

206
00:20:30,509 --> 00:20:31,771
This is for you

207
00:20:32,511 --> 00:20:33,944
- For me?
- Yeah

208
00:20:34,446 --> 00:20:35,811
Thank you

209
00:20:40,686 --> 00:20:41,880
lt was from Sarfaraz

210
00:20:42,488 --> 00:20:45,548
He said.: marriage isn't just
between individuals, but families

211
00:20:45,925 --> 00:20:48,894
Our faiths, countries,
cultures are different

212
00:20:49,428 --> 00:20:51,862
We can never be happy
if our families are unhappy

213
00:20:52,031 --> 00:20:54,465
Don't try to contact me

214
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,065
l'm sorry

215
00:21:16,822 --> 00:21:18,483
Where to go young Iady?

216
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:19,916
New DeIhi

217
00:21:24,296 --> 00:21:28,323
l came back to my city, but
my parents refused to see me

218
00:21:28,534 --> 00:21:30,468
l joined a news channel
as a reporter

219
00:21:30,736 --> 00:21:32,897
Today's story:
a depressed dog

220
00:21:33,305 --> 00:21:34,567
That's our breaking news!

221
00:21:34,907 --> 00:21:38,468
Some days we had news,
some days we fabricated it

222
00:21:58,864 --> 00:22:01,992
Missing: God

223
00:22:02,935 --> 00:22:05,699
If found, contact Tipsy

224
00:22:09,475 --> 00:22:11,875
There's a story in this man.
I'II see you at office

225
00:22:12,277 --> 00:22:13,869
Don't be Iate!

226
00:22:27,459 --> 00:22:28,551
Excuse me?

227
00:22:28,927 --> 00:22:30,554
Why are you
handing these out?

228
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:33,298
I have a case
pending with Him

229
00:22:33,532 --> 00:22:35,500
He neither soIves it,
nor meets me

230
00:22:35,801 --> 00:22:37,996
My Iife is kaput

231
00:22:39,304 --> 00:22:41,829
He's gone into hiding

232
00:22:43,308 --> 00:22:45,538
Have you seen Him around?

233
00:22:46,545 --> 00:22:48,342
No

234
00:22:50,916 --> 00:22:59,483
Hail Goddess,
Hail Holy Mother

235
00:22:59,658 --> 00:23:03,924
Hail Goddess,
Hail Holy Mother

236
00:23:04,329 --> 00:23:06,524
By the way,
what's with the heImet?

237
00:23:06,865 --> 00:23:08,799
Got the idea from taxi-tops

238
00:23:09,301 --> 00:23:11,895
YeIIow yeIIs out from miIes

239
00:23:12,337 --> 00:23:15,329
Taxis are spotted
easiIy in traffic

240
00:23:15,741 --> 00:23:19,268
- So?
- So God can spot me easy!

241
00:23:19,545 --> 00:23:23,641
How eIse wiII he spot me
in this crowd?

242
00:23:31,857 --> 00:23:34,382
A bit to your Ieft - perfect!

243
00:23:34,593 --> 00:23:35,855
Ok, background?

244
00:23:36,462 --> 00:23:37,793
Cue Jaggu

245
00:23:38,664 --> 00:23:41,497
They say
animaIs are not suicidaI

246
00:23:41,834 --> 00:23:45,930
Here's Nikku.
Mr Sweetie Singh's dog

247
00:23:46,605 --> 00:23:50,041
Nikku has attempted
suicide thrice

248
00:23:50,309 --> 00:23:55,838
Jumping off a roof, Iicking sIeeping
piIIs, hopping onto a gas burner

249
00:23:56,315 --> 00:23:58,340
What's wrong with Nikku?

250
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:01,578
Is Nikku prey to a
mentaI probIem?

251
00:24:02,287 --> 00:24:03,584
Is Nikku...

252
00:24:05,758 --> 00:24:07,487
What's wrong Jaggu?

253
00:24:07,893 --> 00:24:09,622
What is this shit, Mitu?

254
00:24:13,866 --> 00:24:17,358
Our chat with famed industriaIist
Mr Ratan continues

255
00:24:17,436 --> 00:24:19,267
right after this break

256
00:24:20,572 --> 00:24:22,802
Going weII, Ratan?
Some coffee?

257
00:24:23,275 --> 00:24:24,537
Get him some coffee

258
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:26,769
- Cherry...
- Oh no!

259
00:24:26,912 --> 00:24:30,370
What's your guess? This dog has
depression, anxiety disorder,

260
00:24:30,582 --> 00:24:33,813
schizophrenia, or ADHD?

261
00:24:34,353 --> 00:24:35,945
Whatever,
why wouId I care?

262
00:24:36,288 --> 00:24:37,277
ExactIy

263
00:24:37,489 --> 00:24:42,290
Why wouId anyone care?
Then why do we air such buII?

264
00:24:42,995 --> 00:24:44,826
What wouId you rather air?

265
00:24:44,963 --> 00:24:47,295
HoId him pIease

266
00:24:49,001 --> 00:24:50,025
See this?

267
00:24:50,435 --> 00:24:53,495
I met a guy distributing
these pamphIets

268
00:24:53,872 --> 00:24:56,636
- He is searching for God.
- Found Him?

269
00:24:57,309 --> 00:24:58,799
No... but

270
00:24:58,911 --> 00:25:03,245
Searching for God - that's reIigion.
Finding God - that's news

271
00:25:03,282 --> 00:25:05,750
If he finds God, get him.
I'II put him on air

272
00:25:05,984 --> 00:25:07,815
You know the Company poIicy

273
00:25:08,253 --> 00:25:10,551
No news on reIigion,
no news on God. Finished

274
00:25:11,256 --> 00:25:12,450
Man, you've changed!

275
00:25:12,825 --> 00:25:14,884
Where's the fighter,
Cherry Bajwa?

276
00:25:15,394 --> 00:25:17,760
You wanna see the fighter?

277
00:25:18,397 --> 00:25:19,864
Take a good Iook

278
00:25:20,432 --> 00:25:22,798
There are three marks here

279
00:25:23,368 --> 00:25:24,801
These aren't birthmarks

280
00:25:24,937 --> 00:25:29,340
I ran a show against His HoIiness,
your Dad's Guru

281
00:25:29,608 --> 00:25:32,839
His devotees shoved a trident
right here in my bum

282
00:25:33,345 --> 00:25:35,745
Anchor coming to you
in 10 seconds

283
00:25:35,881 --> 00:25:38,475
That day I swore -
if you want to Iive in this country

284
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:40,445
don't mess with reIigion.
That's it

285
00:25:40,586 --> 00:25:42,554
- l've got a show to run now.
- 5... 4...

WeIcome back from the break

290
00:25:46,792 --> 00:25:49,818
We were chatting with
famed industriaIist Mr Ratan...

291
00:25:50,028 --> 00:25:52,895
The boss killed my story

292
00:25:53,298 --> 00:25:57,291
But it came back to life
two weeks later

293
00:26:37,476 --> 00:26:39,603

God took His fee
but didn't deIiver

310
00:28:07,532 --> 00:28:09,227
Hang on...

311
00:28:09,701 --> 00:28:13,660
I saw you fish out some money,
then put some back in

312
00:28:13,739 --> 00:28:18,574
I took back what I'd paid
at this branch. Returned the rest

313
00:28:19,578 --> 00:28:21,705
You used to wear
beads and amuIets?

314

Rejected. Gone for good

315
00:28:24,349 --> 00:28:26,840
Why the stickers then?

316
00:28:27,419 --> 00:28:29,580

- For what?
- For the ride home

326
00:29:01,653 --> 00:29:06,249
When someone can't
get home, I feeI sad

00:29:07,893 --> 00:29:11,260
- Wait.
- That's aII I had

- Why?
- Won't you need it to get home?

330
00:29:22,441 --> 00:29:26,241
Money can't get me home

331
00:29:26,378 --> 00:29:29,313
Why? Where do you Iive?

332
00:29:37,289 --> 00:29:40,781
In the step-well ruins

333
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:46,954

That's why I'm committing it!

359
00:32:00,432 --> 00:32:01,399
I can Iock you in

360
00:32:01,466 --> 00:32:03,559
PIease do... ASAP!

361
00:32:10,775 --> 00:32:13,801
- Thank you, Mr Pandey.
- One hour, that's it

362
00:32:13,979 --> 00:32:15,503
Hi

363
00:32:16,681 --> 00:32:21,015
I want your story.
WiII you share it?

364
00:32:21,886 --> 00:32:22,750
Why?

365
00:32:23,021 --> 00:32:26,320
I'm a TV reporter.
It's my job

366
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:43,705
- Go on, ask.
- Awesome!

367
00:32:48,513 --> 00:32:50,743
Your name?

368
00:32:51,616 --> 00:32:53,516
Don't have a name

369
00:32:53,618 --> 00:32:56,314
They caII me Tipsy here.
Beats me why

370
00:32:56,388 --> 00:32:58,754
And what do you do?

371
00:33:00,992 --> 00:33:03,392
I'm an astronaut

372
00:33:04,963 --> 00:33:06,555
Astronaut!

373
00:33:06,831 --> 00:33:09,265
Those who shoot off
to the moon?

374
00:33:09,567 --> 00:33:12,764
Been there once.
lt's kaput

375
00:33:14,439 --> 00:33:15,963
Sure!

376
00:33:16,641 --> 00:33:18,438
So what's your
favorite pIanet?

377
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:21,479
- My own.
- I meant besides Earth?

378
00:33:21,713 --> 00:33:23,738
Earth is mega-kaput

379
00:33:23,982 --> 00:33:26,542
I meant my own pIanet

380
00:33:30,288 --> 00:33:34,281
It'II show up there at night

381
00:33:34,759 --> 00:33:36,989
We went bananas,

382
00:33:37,462 --> 00:33:42,399
when we found another pIanet
with peopIe Iike us

383
00:33:42,967 --> 00:33:45,527
I was sent here
on a research mission

384
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:47,570
Boy, what a weIcome I got!

385
00:33:47,839 --> 00:33:50,000
My remote got robbed

386
00:33:50,842 --> 00:33:54,369
Without it,
I can't signaI my peopIe

387
00:33:54,446 --> 00:33:57,574
and without a signaI
they won't come for me

388
00:33:57,882 --> 00:34:00,544
They'II think
it's a periIous pIanet

389
00:34:00,719 --> 00:34:03,347
That I'm dead as a dodo

390
00:34:07,792 --> 00:34:08,588
HeIIo!

391
00:34:08,827 --> 00:34:10,260
- Listen...
- What?

392
00:34:10,528 --> 00:34:11,995
Let me out.
I want to go home

393
00:34:12,430 --> 00:34:16,389
Your Highness, convicts
don't decide that. Cops do

394
00:34:16,568 --> 00:34:17,933
I'm not a thief

395
00:34:18,269 --> 00:34:19,668
So say aII the thieves

396
00:34:19,971 --> 00:34:22,273
Where's officer Pandey?

397
00:34:22,273 --> 00:34:23,797
Out on his rounds

398
00:34:24,542 --> 00:34:26,271
Officer Pandey!

399
00:34:27,379 --> 00:34:27,845
Officer Pandey!

400
00:34:27,912 --> 00:34:30,972
Shut up, or you get
a knuckIe sandwich

401
00:34:50,735 --> 00:34:53,568
You think
I'm taIking baIoney?

402
00:34:54,305 --> 00:34:55,772
ObviousIy!

403
00:34:56,307 --> 00:34:58,468
Is Hindi the officiaI Ianguage
of your pIanet?

404
00:34:58,576 --> 00:35:00,373
On our pIanet...

405
00:35:00,945 --> 00:35:03,641
.. there's no Ianguage!

406
00:35:03,948 --> 00:35:06,644
We read minds.
There's no confusion

407
00:35:06,885 --> 00:35:09,854
Here, you utter something
and mean something eIse

408
00:35:09,921 --> 00:35:12,287
A two-Ietter word can have
four different meanings

409
00:35:12,724 --> 00:35:17,525
When you nod and say ''oh'',
it means ''Oh, that's cooI''

410
00:35:18,797 --> 00:35:21,994
When your eyes pop out,
''oh!'' means bad news

411
00:35:22,434 --> 00:35:25,267
''Your mother-in-Iaw
is moving in.'' ''Oh!''

412
00:35:26,337 --> 00:35:28,737
When angry, you thunder

413
00:35:29,007 --> 00:35:32,465
''Oh! You'II pay
for that bIunder!''

414
00:35:32,811 --> 00:35:35,712
And when your thought is deep,
your ''oh'' is Iong!

415
00:35:36,548 --> 00:35:38,880
''Ohhhhhhh! I see!''

416
00:35:39,818 --> 00:35:43,015
As you hear the words,
you gotta watch the expression

417
00:35:43,288 --> 00:35:45,279
to get the reaI meaning

418
00:35:45,356 --> 00:35:49,486
It's torture!
Took fuII 6 hours to Iearn Hindi

419
00:35:49,627 --> 00:35:52,721
A whoIe Ianguage in 6 hours?

420
00:35:52,797 --> 00:35:55,391
No one Iet me hoId hands

421
00:35:55,834 --> 00:35:57,961
FinaIIy, a nice Iady
Ient her hand

422
00:35:58,036 --> 00:36:01,904
I heId it and transferred
her Ianguage into my system

423
00:36:01,973 --> 00:36:06,842
Man, there's no Iimit
to your whoppers!

424
00:36:06,945 --> 00:36:09,470
Is your hand a USB cabIe,

425
00:36:09,747 --> 00:36:13,478
that transfers fiIes
between computers?

426
00:36:13,785 --> 00:36:17,516
And your cIothes? Are faded jeans
the rage on your pIanet too?

427
00:36:17,689 --> 00:36:19,247
Noooo!

428
00:36:19,524 --> 00:36:20,650
On our pIanet...

429
00:36:20,892 --> 00:36:24,919
.. no one wears cIothes.
There we go bare

430
00:36:25,396 --> 00:36:28,263
Here, at first I thought

431
00:36:28,766 --> 00:36:32,258
your skins were
different from ours

432
00:36:32,770 --> 00:36:34,931
Some had sparkly hides,

433
00:36:35,273 --> 00:36:37,867
some jet black

434
00:36:38,943 --> 00:36:41,912
Some hides were colorful,
some white

435
00:36:42,847 --> 00:36:46,840
Some hides sticky-tight,
some baggy

436
00:36:48,887 --> 00:36:51,788
Then one day
l found a car

437
00:36:52,023 --> 00:36:53,388
A dancing car

438
00:36:59,597 --> 00:37:04,967
That day l realized
our skins were the same

439
00:37:05,370 --> 00:37:10,239
but yours are covered
with a thing called fashion

440
00:37:15,513 --> 00:37:18,277
Radio CommerciaI

441
00:37:18,449 --> 00:37:21,714
Now l could mingle

442
00:37:21,986 --> 00:37:25,717
Yet l was mocked

443
00:37:26,524 --> 00:37:29,823
Look here -
haIf man, haIf woman!

444
00:37:30,995 --> 00:37:32,587
Slowly l got it

445
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:35,756
There's man - fashion
and woman - fashion

446
00:37:36,568 --> 00:37:37,830
There was day fashion...

447
00:37:38,269 --> 00:37:39,759
.. and night fashion

448
00:37:40,271 --> 00:37:41,499
Sporting fashion...

449
00:37:41,539 --> 00:37:43,302
.. and serving fashion

450
00:37:46,311 --> 00:37:50,270
With the clothes,
l found some photos

451
00:38:02,594 --> 00:38:07,964
lt hit me - these photos
meant survival

452
00:38:08,766 --> 00:38:11,564
You could
swap them for food

453
00:38:11,736 --> 00:38:15,228
So l built a portfolio
of this old man's photos

454
00:38:30,822 --> 00:38:32,585
What's this?

455
00:38:36,728 --> 00:38:38,992
What are these for?

456
00:38:41,499 --> 00:38:44,593
Why are you giving me
this junk?

457
00:38:47,271 --> 00:38:49,603
Right! Now we're taIking!

458
00:38:49,874 --> 00:38:51,637
Here you go

459
00:38:52,644 --> 00:38:56,774
l got it.: this photo had value
on just one kind of paper

460
00:38:57,315 --> 00:39:01,513
On any other paper,
it was worthless

461
00:39:03,721 --> 00:39:07,282
For cash and clothes,
dancing cars were widely available

462
00:39:07,425 --> 00:39:10,485
They were my bank,
they were my tailor!

463
00:39:12,330 --> 00:39:14,628
Once, l got
such magnetic attire

464
00:39:14,866 --> 00:39:17,835
that no photos
were needed

465
00:39:17,902 --> 00:39:20,234
Food was pulled to me

466
00:39:20,405 --> 00:39:22,236
For you, Sir

467
00:39:24,475 --> 00:39:28,434
Now, to find my remote, l had to
learn this planet's language

468
00:39:28,613 --> 00:39:31,707
Without it,
every task was a trial

469
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:33,774
Like telling this gentleman

470
00:39:33,918 --> 00:39:37,547
there was a defect
in his fashion

471
00:39:44,429 --> 00:39:47,694
l felt l had spoilt his fashion

472
00:39:49,367 --> 00:39:52,393
So l put it back
where it was

473
00:40:13,424 --> 00:40:19,385
[Radio Announcement]

474
00:40:23,301 --> 00:40:24,768
Found him on the road

475
00:40:25,436 --> 00:40:27,495
Some scumbag
hit him and boIted

476
00:40:28,306 --> 00:40:30,331
Seems pretty okay,

477
00:40:31,509 --> 00:40:33,602
but isn't responding

478
00:40:34,445 --> 00:40:36,743
Has his eardrum
caIIed it a day?

479
00:40:37,048 --> 00:40:38,982
Are you deaf?

480
00:40:39,517 --> 00:40:42,918
Can hear aIright,
but isn't taIking

481
00:40:43,621 --> 00:40:45,816
Seems in a state of shock

482
00:40:46,057 --> 00:40:49,322
Memory Ioss, I'm afraid

483
00:40:59,837 --> 00:41:02,806
Remember the scumbag
who hit you?

484
00:41:05,009 --> 00:41:07,409
Remember the Iicense pIate?

485
00:41:08,546 --> 00:41:11,743
Remember anything at aII?

486
00:41:40,044 --> 00:41:43,502
Come my friend.
Come with me

487
00:41:44,649 --> 00:41:48,642

Keep sIamming your head

489
00:41:53,357 --> 00:41:58,659
One knock took your memory away,
another might bring it back

490
00:41:58,863 --> 00:42:00,455
Seen it in the movies

491
00:42:00,531 --> 00:42:02,863
To figure what he was
yapping about,

492
00:42:02,934 --> 00:42:07,303
l had to hold his hand
and transfer his language

493
00:42:09,574 --> 00:42:11,269
Hey!

494
00:42:12,844 --> 00:42:16,280
With memory Ioss your gender
sense went for a toss?

495
00:42:16,514 --> 00:42:17,412
Wait a moment...

496
00:42:18,482 --> 00:42:19,881
See this - my Iicense

Man...

499
00:42:23,287 --> 00:42:25,949
rogue, rascaI, scumbag

500
00:42:27,625 --> 00:42:32,619
To return home
l had to hold someone's hand

501
00:42:48,679 --> 00:42:52,672

535
00:46:46,851 --> 00:46:51,720
You may end up in bed,
but most IikeIy a hospitaI bed

536
00:46:54,992 --> 00:46:58,792
Don't give up,
I know pIace for you

537
00:47:10,774 --> 00:47:14,232
Hand, foot -
hoId whatever

538
00:47:14,411 --> 00:47:16,242
No one wiII bash you here

539
00:47:16,514 --> 00:47:17,538
Come

540
00:47:17,781 --> 00:47:22,514
What a neighborhood!
Virtuous, welcoming women

541
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:26,356
All reaching for my hand,
inviting me home

542
00:47:26,690 --> 00:47:30,956
Here l met a serene and
gentle woman, Pepper

543
00:47:31,262 --> 00:47:34,789
Pepper, take him
to the honeymoon suite

544
00:48:23,948 --> 00:48:25,973
Pepper sat patiently all night

545
00:48:26,350 --> 00:48:31,413
For full 6 hours,
l transferred her language files

546
00:48:31,855 --> 00:48:37,350
ABC - XYZ,
l drew in everything

547
00:48:47,805 --> 00:48:52,833
First time?... Kaput before you kicked off?

548
00:48:57,982 --> 00:48:59,973
Y...y... yes!

549
00:49:01,385 --> 00:49:03,819
Where are you from?

550
00:49:06,790 --> 00:49:09,350
Far, far away

551
00:49:10,261 --> 00:49:13,287
From an unheard of viIIage

552
00:49:13,497 --> 00:49:15,931
But you speak my Iingo!

553
00:49:16,467 --> 00:49:21,302
Because I Iearnt it from you,
Sister

554
00:49:21,405 --> 00:49:25,307
Sister! You think
this is a convent? Out!

555
00:49:27,444 --> 00:49:28,274
Bro!

556
00:49:29,513 --> 00:49:31,481
Bro, wake up!

557
00:49:32,283 --> 00:49:33,648
Bro, wake up!

558
00:49:34,451 --> 00:49:35,315
Bro!

559
00:49:36,654 --> 00:49:38,246
You're taIking!

560
00:49:38,289 --> 00:49:40,883
Bro, I need your heIp

561
00:49:41,258 --> 00:49:43,283
Pepper cIeared up your throat!

562
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:45,257
Bro, come with me quick

563
00:49:45,296 --> 00:49:47,992
Memory and making out
have a direct connection!

564
00:49:48,832 --> 00:49:53,292
Update the docs:
get Iaid, get weII!

565
00:49:53,404 --> 00:49:55,736
It's urgent, bro!

566
00:49:55,939 --> 00:49:56,963
Okay, Iet's go

567
00:50:04,281 --> 00:50:05,612
Stop... stop!

568
00:50:05,783 --> 00:50:07,683
Stop, bro!

569
00:50:11,288 --> 00:50:14,951
The jerk robbed me
right here

570
00:50:15,526 --> 00:50:18,324
I need my chain, bro.
I must get it back

571
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:20,395
- Precious?
- It's priceIess!

572
00:50:20,931 --> 00:50:23,627
The thief must be a IocaI

573
00:50:24,001 --> 00:50:26,799
But he'II seII
the Ioot in DeIhi

574
00:50:26,937 --> 00:50:30,566
If he soId pricey stuff here,
he'd get caught

575
00:50:31,608 --> 00:50:33,473
Then I must go

576
00:50:33,744 --> 00:50:35,439
Where?

577
00:50:36,046 --> 00:50:37,343
DeIhi

578
00:51:01,305 --> 00:51:02,772
- Officer!
- Yeah?

579
00:51:03,374 --> 00:51:06,434
- My remote controI is stoIen.
- Are you tipsy?

580
00:51:06,710 --> 00:51:09,645
Expect the poIice force
to track your TV remote?

581
00:51:10,314 --> 00:51:12,976
- It's not a TV remote!
- Then?

582
00:51:13,951 --> 00:51:17,387
Can't teII you.
But it's Iike a chain

583
00:51:17,454 --> 00:51:18,853
ReaIIy precious

584
00:51:19,289 --> 00:51:21,780
- Where was it stoIen?
- In Mandawa

585
00:51:22,793 --> 00:51:26,729
And you're searching
in DeIhi, you idiot?

586
00:51:27,331 --> 00:51:28,992
The thief came to DeIhi

587
00:51:29,299 --> 00:51:31,290
- So?
- So where's the thief?

588
00:51:31,335 --> 00:51:34,304
BIockhead!
It's a city of 15 miIIion

589
00:51:34,438 --> 00:51:39,398
PoIice are human,
not God

590
00:51:40,811 --> 00:51:44,440
OnIy God can heIp you

591
00:51:45,516 --> 00:51:50,954
Surrender to God,
you'II succeed

592
00:51:51,388 --> 00:51:55,688
OnIy God knows

593
00:51:55,893 --> 00:51:59,624
Ask God, not me!

594
00:52:00,531 --> 00:52:03,898
Trust in God, my chiId

595
00:52:04,368 --> 00:52:09,738
Who was this God chap?
All said only He could help

596
00:52:10,407 --> 00:52:13,399
What l saw blew my mind

597
00:52:13,677 --> 00:52:17,511
Earthlings had figured out
who had manufactured them!

598
00:52:17,881 --> 00:52:22,284
Their creator lived with them.
He had millions of houses

599
00:52:22,519 --> 00:52:28,856
Earthlings took their problems to Him,
which He solved for a small fee

600
00:52:29,393 --> 00:52:32,954
My planet had no such facility

601
00:52:33,397 --> 00:52:38,334
l could not believe it!
So decided to test it

602
00:52:40,337 --> 00:52:42,328
One take-away God

603
00:52:42,372 --> 00:52:45,739
Which one?
Rs 20, 100, 500?

604
00:52:46,310 --> 00:52:49,609
Any difference?
In the Rs 20 and Rs 500 ones?

605
00:52:49,813 --> 00:52:51,872
Just the size.
Otherwise ditto

606
00:52:51,949 --> 00:52:55,544
Rs 20 God is
equaIIy efficient?

607
00:52:56,587 --> 00:53:00,318
OK, gimme Rs15!
Nothing Iess

608
00:53:13,003 --> 00:53:17,406
God, I am famished.
Get me some food pIease

609
00:53:29,386 --> 00:53:30,876
l went bananas

610
00:53:31,455 --> 00:53:35,414
God actually worked!
Now l could go home

611
00:53:35,492 --> 00:53:38,484
God, my remote is stoIen

612
00:53:38,729 --> 00:53:41,857
PIease find it.
I want to go home

613
00:53:55,312 --> 00:53:59,408
God's battery died.
Worked once, then kaput

614
00:53:59,483 --> 00:54:00,916
What do you mean?

615
00:54:00,984 --> 00:54:03,452
Stick a new battery in.
Where does it go?

616
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:06,614
- It needs no battery.
- Then why is it off?

617
00:54:06,924 --> 00:54:10,621
- Manufacturing defect?
- I make no defective stuff

618
00:54:11,695 --> 00:54:16,462
- You made this God?
- Of course! With my own hands

619
00:54:16,967 --> 00:54:19,936
You made God,
or God made you?

620
00:54:20,270 --> 00:54:25,298
He made us aII -
I onIy make His statues

621
00:54:25,442 --> 00:54:27,603
Why the statues?

622
00:54:27,711 --> 00:54:31,545
To worship Him.
To voice our probIems

623
00:54:31,848 --> 00:54:36,308
Is there a transmitter inside?
How can He hear us?

624
00:54:37,287 --> 00:54:41,883
God needs no transmitter.
He hears directIy

625
00:54:41,959 --> 00:54:44,928
DirectIy?
Then why the statue?

626
00:54:45,329 --> 00:54:47,797
What's with him?

627
00:54:48,732 --> 00:54:52,532
Want to bust my business?
What's your probIem?

628
00:54:53,337 --> 00:54:55,305
My remote is stoIen, Sir

629
00:54:55,472 --> 00:54:58,737
I'm requesting God.
But He doesn't repIy

630
00:54:59,309 --> 00:55:01,277
- Are you tipsy?
- Meaning?

631
00:55:01,311 --> 00:55:04,439
You're overIoading
this pint-sized God

632
00:55:04,481 --> 00:55:07,245
His itty-bitty feet
can't chase the thief

633
00:55:07,351 --> 00:55:10,377
Bother the big God
inside the tempIe

634
00:55:10,787 --> 00:55:13,278
He'II run fast

635
00:55:13,323 --> 00:55:16,884
Offer Him coconut and money -
He'II deIiver

636
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:18,894
That'II be Rs 200

637
00:55:24,434 --> 00:55:28,632
Earthlings waited with fees
to get their work done

638
00:55:28,972 --> 00:55:31,770
Full 2 hours later
l got the appointment

639
00:55:31,942 --> 00:55:33,432
God,

640
00:55:34,978 --> 00:55:38,470
pIease get my remote back

641
00:55:40,484 --> 00:55:42,543
- Where is it?
- Move!

642
00:55:42,753 --> 00:55:44,618
Wait,
He didn't deIiver my stuff

643
00:55:44,921 --> 00:55:49,358
He didn't deIiver!
See, I paid His fee

644
00:55:49,426 --> 00:55:51,417
- Your work wiII be done.
- But when?

645
00:55:51,495 --> 00:55:53,895
Can't say when,
but it wiII be done

646
00:55:54,031 --> 00:55:56,829
- Move on.
- But when wiII I get it?

647
00:55:56,900 --> 00:55:58,595
Don't bIock the Iine, scram!

648
00:55:58,702 --> 00:56:01,398
If I scram,
someone eIse may get it

649
00:56:01,471 --> 00:56:02,301
Are you tipsy?

650
00:56:02,372 --> 00:56:06,274
Lady, pIease!
Where wiII I get my stuff?

651
00:56:06,343 --> 00:56:08,243
At the mentaI hospitaI!

652
00:56:08,345 --> 00:56:12,247
What? Cash here,
deIivery at mentaI hospitaI!

653
00:56:12,282 --> 00:56:14,512
- Throw him out!
- OK, give me a receipt

654
00:56:14,618 --> 00:56:15,380
Out!

655
00:56:15,485 --> 00:56:18,784
Without a receipt
how do I cIaim my deIivery?

656
00:56:18,855 --> 00:56:21,346
Get out!

657
00:56:21,425 --> 00:56:22,585
But my remote?

658
00:56:22,726 --> 00:56:23,886
Leave!

659
00:56:31,802 --> 00:56:34,566
I can't find my shoes

660
00:56:35,005 --> 00:56:38,304
Someone's taken them.
Now you take your pick

661
00:56:38,608 --> 00:56:41,543
Rotation is routine
at tempIes

662
00:56:54,891 --> 00:56:59,453
He took the payment,
didn't deIiver

663
00:57:03,366 --> 00:57:04,628
What's his name?

664
00:57:04,701 --> 00:57:06,828
- They caII Him God
- ReaI name?

665
00:57:07,304 --> 00:57:08,737
No idea

666
00:57:10,407 --> 00:57:11,567
Where does he Iive?

667
00:57:12,342 --> 00:57:14,333
In that tempIe

668
00:57:14,544 --> 00:57:18,344
- You handed him the cash?
- No. Put it in His box

669
00:57:18,415 --> 00:57:20,975
- Said he'd do the job?
- He says nothing

670
00:57:21,251 --> 00:57:22,741
Is he mute?

671
00:57:22,919 --> 00:57:24,614
Perhaps... maybe

672
00:57:25,255 --> 00:57:26,779
Oh...

673
00:57:28,425 --> 00:57:30,484
Describe him

674
00:57:33,296 --> 00:57:35,264
Ditto

675
00:57:36,967 --> 00:57:39,527
But a bigger chap

676
00:57:40,504 --> 00:57:41,766
Come near...

677
00:57:43,673 --> 00:57:45,004
Are you tipsy?

678
00:57:45,809 --> 00:57:48,607
Yes.
How do you aII know?

679
00:57:48,712 --> 00:57:52,375
Think I'm a jackass?
20 years a cop!

680
00:57:52,482 --> 00:57:55,474
Who's tipsy who's not
I can teII in a snap

681
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:59,489
Frisk him

682
00:58:00,957 --> 00:58:03,482
Let me have a Iook

683
00:58:04,895 --> 00:58:06,658
Dr D'MeIIo...

684
00:58:07,397 --> 00:58:12,300
Doc, why get so buzzed
you forget your faith?

685
00:58:12,502 --> 00:58:16,370
Mistook tempIe for a church!
Wanna rouse a riot?

686
00:58:16,907 --> 00:58:21,401
Go to church.
To your own God

687
00:58:23,446 --> 00:58:25,243
Church?

688
00:59:13,630 --> 00:59:14,961
Get out of here

689
00:59:15,265 --> 00:59:18,257
My stuff!
My remote!

690
00:59:18,535 --> 00:59:21,663
God was crucified for your sins.
UngratefuI man!

691
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:26,232
Crucified! When?

692
00:59:26,509 --> 00:59:29,876
2,000 years ago.
For your sins!

693
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:33,574
What did I do?
I just got here

694
00:59:35,318 --> 00:59:37,377
- Are you tipsy?
- Yes!

695
00:59:37,454 --> 00:59:40,252
God is watching you.
Behave

696
00:59:40,824 --> 00:59:42,451
Where?

697
00:59:42,726 --> 00:59:43,988
Where is God?

698
00:59:44,527 --> 00:59:45,994
What's in the mug?

699
00:59:46,263 --> 00:59:47,560
Wine

700
00:59:47,797 --> 00:59:51,699
Wine!
Now l got it!

701
00:59:52,569 --> 00:59:55,299
God was bored of
coconut water

702
00:59:55,505 --> 00:59:59,373
Now He preferred wine.
But wine was expensive

703
00:59:59,576 --> 01:00:01,601
So l had to muster money

704
01:00:03,346 --> 01:00:07,840
l got some from the dancing car,
some from a gentleman

705
01:00:08,285 --> 01:00:10,845
who held out a bowl
of dole everyday

706
01:00:11,354 --> 01:00:14,482
You could withdraw
as per need

707
01:00:25,902 --> 01:00:31,397
[Radio Announcement]

708
01:00:34,711 --> 01:00:36,770
Sir, any God house
around here?

709
01:00:36,913 --> 01:00:38,881
Right there

710
01:00:39,015 --> 01:00:48,048
Preacher, Iet me drink
in God's abode

711
01:00:51,695 --> 01:00:58,464
Or show me a pIace
where there is no God

712
01:00:59,402 --> 01:01:01,870
Stop!
What's that?

713
01:01:02,305 --> 01:01:04,273
Wine, for God

714
01:01:04,574 --> 01:01:06,474
Where is He?

715
01:01:46,649 --> 01:01:48,844
This lady looked very sad

716
01:01:49,319 --> 01:01:51,981
To know why,
l grabbed her hand

717
01:01:52,422 --> 01:01:54,788
Hitting on a widow,
you Iech!

718
01:01:55,025 --> 01:01:57,357
Widow?
How do you know?

719
01:01:57,494 --> 01:01:59,485
Don't you see
she's cIad in white?

720
01:02:11,341 --> 01:02:12,330
Is everything fine?

721
01:02:12,409 --> 01:02:14,400
Everything is fine.

722
01:02:15,545 --> 01:02:17,479
Just reIax. SmiIe.

723
01:02:18,848 --> 01:02:21,510
So sorry
your husband's dead

724
01:02:21,584 --> 01:02:22,915
- What?
- When?

725
01:02:23,286 --> 01:02:26,278
How do I know?
You are cIad in white

726
01:02:26,356 --> 01:02:28,290
Brides wear white!

727
01:02:28,358 --> 01:02:30,952
No, widows wear white

728
01:02:31,327 --> 01:02:32,726
Widows wear bIack,
stupid!

729
01:02:32,796 --> 01:02:35,924
Now don't
stress her out. Go!

730
01:02:45,942 --> 01:02:48,433
AII three Iost your husbands?

731
01:02:48,778 --> 01:02:50,973
I'm aIive you moron!
Want a whack?

732
01:02:52,649 --> 01:02:54,776
After many whacks,
l learnt

733
01:02:54,851 --> 01:02:58,446
there wasn't one God.
There were many Gods

734
01:02:58,555 --> 01:03:00,853
Each with His own
set of rules

735
01:03:01,324 --> 01:03:03,588
Each God had floated
His own Company

736
01:03:04,260 --> 01:03:06,251
They called it religion

737
01:03:06,596 --> 01:03:09,690
Each Company had
its own agents

738
01:03:09,899 --> 01:03:14,927
All Earthlings belonged to
some religion

739
01:03:15,405 --> 01:03:19,899
and followed the God
of that religion alone

740
01:03:20,577 --> 01:03:24,274
What was my religion,
who was my God?

741
01:03:24,781 --> 01:03:27,614
To find the remote
l had to know my God

742
01:03:43,466 --> 01:03:45,400
What are you doing?

743
01:03:45,635 --> 01:03:47,296
Where is the IabeI?

744
01:03:47,504 --> 01:03:49,335
What IabeI?

745
01:03:49,806 --> 01:03:51,467
The ReIigion IabeI

746
01:03:52,408 --> 01:03:54,933
How do you know which
Company he beIongs to?

747
01:03:55,578 --> 01:03:58,046
Where does God
IabeI them?

748
01:03:58,748 --> 01:03:59,715
Security!

749
01:04:07,257 --> 01:04:09,748
Finding my religion
was tough

750
01:04:10,393 --> 01:04:15,262
So l decided to
worship all Gods

751
01:04:15,465 --> 01:04:19,265
One of them would be
my God, who'd help me

752
01:04:19,469 --> 01:04:25,772
lt's You who governs
The world l hear

753
01:04:26,276 --> 01:04:31,942
Do listen to my plea
My home beckons me

754
01:04:32,448 --> 01:04:37,613
God where are You

755
01:04:39,289 --> 01:04:44,989
Tell me where are You

756
01:04:46,296 --> 01:04:52,792
You guide back to sanity
Those who've lost their way

757
01:04:52,869 --> 01:04:58,933
l too am completely lost
Guide me too, l pray

758
01:04:59,442 --> 01:05:04,470
God where are You

759
01:05:05,949 --> 01:05:11,819
Tell me where are You

760
01:05:39,582 --> 01:05:42,574
Shall l worship You
in temples

761
01:05:42,986 --> 01:05:45,955
ln mosques
do my faith l show

762
01:05:46,389 --> 01:05:52,385
Or to a gurudwara
would You like me to go

763
01:05:52,996 --> 01:05:59,629
Temples and churches,
l looked everywhere

764
01:05:59,836 --> 01:06:05,797
My hope now,
has turned to despair

765
01:06:06,576 --> 01:06:11,741
My hope now,
has turned to despair

766
01:06:13,416 --> 01:06:19,412
My hope now,
has turned to despair

767
01:06:23,559 --> 01:06:29,464
Not a single ritual
Did l ever flout

768
01:06:30,566 --> 01:06:36,436
Like millions around
l submit without a doubt

769
01:06:36,806 --> 01:06:41,766
God where are You

770
01:06:43,513 --> 01:06:48,576
Tell me where are You

771
01:07:16,946 --> 01:07:23,476
You have many names
And many faces too

772
01:07:23,786 --> 01:07:29,850
l've walked each of the myriad
paths which lead to You

773
01:07:30,560 --> 01:07:36,692
ln no shrine did l find You

774
01:07:37,300 --> 01:07:42,397
What else should l do
To find you give a clue

775
01:07:43,906 --> 01:07:49,367
What else should l do
To find you give a clue

776
01:07:50,847 --> 01:07:56,308
What else should l do
To find you give a clue

777
01:08:01,324 --> 01:08:06,921
l blindly follow and
With reverence treasure

778
01:08:07,897 --> 01:08:13,733
Your every whim and fancy
ln more than ample measure

779
01:08:14,404 --> 01:08:18,807
God where are you

780
01:08:20,877 --> 01:08:25,405
Tell me where are you

781
01:08:27,717 --> 01:08:32,848
God where are you

782
01:08:34,490 --> 01:08:40,690
Tell me where are you

783
01:08:49,839 --> 01:08:52,865
God - I'm aII confused

784
01:08:54,710 --> 01:08:59,477
What's my fauIt?
Why can't my voice reach you?

785
01:09:00,917 --> 01:09:03,545
Understand my pIight

786
01:09:03,953 --> 01:09:06,251
Give me some guidance

787
01:09:06,656 --> 01:09:08,647
PIease

788
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:13,485
ShaII I taIk to you
with hands cIasped,

789
01:09:13,796 --> 01:09:18,790
or on bent knees,
head to the ground?

790
01:09:21,270 --> 01:09:23,397
Do I wake you
with tempIe beIIs?

791
01:09:23,739 --> 01:09:25,707
Or caII out on a Ioudspeaker?

792
01:09:26,742 --> 01:09:32,237
The Geeta, the Quran,
the BibIe - what do I read?

793
01:09:32,682 --> 01:09:36,675
Your different managers
say different things

794
01:09:37,353 --> 01:09:41,813
Some insist fast on Monday,
others urge on Tuesday

795
01:09:42,358 --> 01:09:47,261
Some forbid food after sunset,
some after sunrise

796
01:09:47,897 --> 01:09:51,833
Some say, worship the cow.
Others say sIaughter her

797
01:09:52,568 --> 01:09:57,972
Some send me barefoot to the tempIe,
some wearing shoes to the church

798
01:09:58,474 --> 01:10:01,272
What is right,
what is wrong

799
01:10:01,577 --> 01:10:03,875
I am cIueIess

800
01:10:05,581 --> 01:10:08,311
I'm at breaking point

801
01:10:10,586 --> 01:10:12,713
I want to go home

802
01:10:13,289 --> 01:10:17,487

Missing.: God

812
01:11:09,445 --> 01:11:10,412
Missing.: God

813
01:11:45,781 --> 01:11:47,442
Why the Iock man?

814
01:11:47,516 --> 01:11:49,541
I gotcha today

815
01:11:50,319 --> 01:11:51,445
Open!
It's my entry!

816
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:53,579
Lord Shiva, sIayer of sins

817
01:11:53,990 --> 01:11:55,423
who fears none

818
01:11:55,791 --> 01:11:58,316
Security!
Who are you?

819
01:11:58,394 --> 01:12:00,487
Don't you recognize me?

820
01:12:00,963 --> 01:12:03,261
I'm Tipsy!

821
01:12:04,567 --> 01:12:06,865
Where the heII is security?

822
01:12:07,269 --> 01:12:10,705
Do I perform
for boozards in the toiIet?

823
01:12:12,408 --> 01:12:14,535
UnIock that door now!

824
01:12:14,710 --> 01:12:16,405
My remote first!

825
01:12:16,479 --> 01:12:19,676
- What remote?
- Of my spaceship

826
01:12:19,982 --> 01:12:21,279
Space... ship?

827
01:12:21,484 --> 01:12:24,749
Memory Ioss?
For the ziIIionth time,

828
01:12:25,321 --> 01:12:27,983
I'm not from here.
I'm from a far off pIanet

829
01:12:28,324 --> 01:12:29,382
Scooch!

830
01:12:29,592 --> 01:12:33,494
Gimme my remote,
and I go home. Got it?

831
01:12:33,929 --> 01:12:37,296
Brother Iet me go.
I've IittIe kids at home

832
01:12:37,333 --> 01:12:39,733
I know!
You fathered two Gods

833
01:12:39,802 --> 01:12:42,566
Both are centuries oId.
They can be home aIone

834
01:12:42,638 --> 01:12:45,368
First my remote,
then your famiIy reunion

835
01:12:46,308 --> 01:12:47,775
Oh God, save me pIease...

836
01:12:47,877 --> 01:12:49,538
There's a God
above you too?

837
01:12:49,612 --> 01:12:50,874
Lord Shiva, heIp

838
01:12:50,980 --> 01:12:52,777
Where?

839
01:12:54,817 --> 01:12:58,412
Now presenting the dance of Shiva,
the fearIess

840
01:12:58,487 --> 01:12:59,579
HeIp!

841
01:13:00,056 --> 01:13:00,988
HeIp!

842
01:13:03,259 --> 01:13:04,453
HeIp!

843
01:13:11,267 --> 01:13:13,701
HeIp!

844
01:13:14,804 --> 01:13:15,793
HeIp!

845
01:13:32,822 --> 01:13:36,314
Hail Lord Shiva

846
01:13:54,944 --> 01:13:58,778
Hail Lord Shiva

847
01:13:59,448 --> 01:14:04,943
I was meditating on the
snowy peaks of the HimaIayas

848
01:14:05,421 --> 01:14:08,584
when, suddenIy - Iight!

849
01:14:08,891 --> 01:14:11,257
DazzIing Iight!

850
01:14:11,861 --> 01:14:17,299
It came from a bead
Iying in the snow

851
01:14:17,967 --> 01:14:22,529
I shut my eyes
and invoked God

852
01:14:22,605 --> 01:14:25,665
Next moment,
I was connected

853
01:14:25,741 --> 01:14:28,574
I said,
''God, enIighten me,''

854
01:14:28,811 --> 01:14:31,280
What is this
miracuIous object,

855
01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:34,443
that is warm
even in this biting coId?

856
01:14:34,917 --> 01:14:36,282
God said,

857
01:14:36,318 --> 01:14:41,017
it's a divine bead
from Lord Shiva's neckIace

858
01:14:41,290 --> 01:14:47,024
Take it and enshrine it
in a grand tempIe

859
01:14:47,363 --> 01:14:53,734
Sighting this bead
wiII heaI aII suffering

860
01:14:53,803 --> 01:14:56,636
HaiI Lord Shiva

861
01:14:57,439 --> 01:14:59,805
Are you ready
for the sighting?

862
01:15:00,309 --> 01:15:02,971
The divine bead from
Lord Shiva's neckIace!

863
01:15:06,782 --> 01:15:11,378
HaiI Lord Shiva

864
01:15:11,887 --> 01:15:15,983
HaiI Lord Shiva

865
01:15:24,900 --> 01:15:27,528
HaiI Lord Shiva

866
01:15:27,837 --> 01:15:29,702
HaiI Lord Shiva

867
01:15:29,905 --> 01:15:30,803
Stop.

868
01:15:30,873 --> 01:15:35,276
Let him through.
He's awed by the sight

869
01:15:35,311 --> 01:15:37,302
Come.
- HaiI Lord Shiva

870
01:15:37,379 --> 01:15:40,507
Not there chiId.
Come here

871
01:15:40,783 --> 01:15:42,614
Express your ecstasy

872
01:15:42,751 --> 01:15:44,981
HaiI Lord Shiva

873
01:15:45,387 --> 01:15:48,788
HaiI Lord Shiva

874
01:15:49,291 --> 01:15:51,589
God, where are you?
PIease step out,

875
01:15:51,627 --> 01:15:53,857
I want to thank you

876
01:15:55,297 --> 01:15:56,696
He's right here

877
01:15:57,032 --> 01:15:58,795
I met Him in the toiIet

878
01:15:58,868 --> 01:16:01,496
I asked for my property
and He boIted

879
01:16:01,770 --> 01:16:03,635
I thought He vamoosed

880
01:16:03,906 --> 01:16:07,569
But no!
He Ied me to my property

881
01:16:07,810 --> 01:16:10,335
HaiI Lord Shiva

882
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:13,339
This isn't Lord Shiva's bead

883
01:16:13,515 --> 01:16:16,450
It's my property,
misdeIivered to you

884
01:16:16,518 --> 01:16:18,509
Your bead must be
misdeIivered too

885
01:16:18,754 --> 01:16:23,555
Ask God, He is right here.
God, do step forward, cIarify

886
01:16:25,594 --> 01:16:28,529
Anyway,
I'II take my property

887
01:16:30,532 --> 01:16:33,501
That's mine!
Why're you stopping me?

888
01:16:35,504 --> 01:16:39,406
HaiI Lord Shiva

889
01:17:39,301 --> 01:17:44,796
Since when have you feIt
you're from another pIanet?

890
01:17:47,009 --> 01:17:53,312
Listen. You need to see
a psychiatrist

891
01:17:54,316 --> 01:17:58,412
Time up! Rs 500 can buy
onIy this much jaiI time

892
01:18:05,260 --> 01:18:07,251
Here's my card

893
01:18:07,830 --> 01:18:11,891
My number's on it. I'II get you
an appointment if you wish

894
01:18:12,434 --> 01:18:14,868
FeeI free to caII. Okay?

895
01:18:16,271 --> 01:18:17,932
Take care

896
01:18:19,908 --> 01:18:22,240
Thank you officer Pandey

897
01:18:23,746 --> 01:18:26,772
You don't beIieve my story?

898
01:18:28,884 --> 01:18:33,253
Then go back to
the suicidaI dog, Nikku

899
01:18:33,689 --> 01:18:36,283
That's the story for you

900
01:18:42,865 --> 01:18:46,562
I need to go back in
for 2 minutes

901
01:18:47,369 --> 01:18:50,532
Quit these entry - exits

902
01:18:50,939 --> 01:18:55,740
Another Rs 500,
he's aII yours

903
01:18:55,944 --> 01:18:59,607
When did I mention Nikku,
the suicidaI dog?

904
01:19:00,015 --> 01:19:01,642
You didn't

905
01:19:01,917 --> 01:19:03,817
So how do you know?

906
01:19:04,286 --> 01:19:08,950
When you heId my hands,
I read your thoughts

907
01:19:09,958 --> 01:19:11,721
You thought:
this story is dead

908
01:19:11,894 --> 01:19:13,486
I got to Iive with the
Nikku story

909
01:19:13,695 --> 01:19:16,630
Don't Iie!
I must have mentioned it

910
01:19:16,765 --> 01:19:20,223
I cannot Iie.
Lies need Ianguage

911
01:19:20,402 --> 01:19:23,860
On our pIanet
we hoId hands, read minds

912
01:19:24,873 --> 01:19:26,306
- Gimme your hand.
- No way

913
01:19:26,442 --> 01:19:28,637
- Try it...
- HeIp me, son

914
01:19:28,877 --> 01:19:34,247
My wife's iII. HospitaI wants
a deposit of Rs 10,000

915
01:19:34,416 --> 01:19:38,614
I'm Rs 500 short.
If you can heIp...

916
01:19:38,754 --> 01:19:40,415
I'II give you

917
01:19:41,256 --> 01:19:42,348
Here

918
01:19:42,458 --> 01:19:45,256
Give your address.
I'II courier a check

919
01:19:45,294 --> 01:19:48,422
Courier can't reach my home.
PIease keep it

920
01:19:48,597 --> 01:19:50,326
Thank you

921
01:19:51,266 --> 01:19:52,358
Sir...

922
01:19:52,868 --> 01:19:55,894
Here's another Rs 100.
For the tip

923
01:19:58,273 --> 01:20:00,298
BIess you

924
01:20:01,410 --> 01:20:05,312
Confirmed.
You are no mind reader

925
01:20:05,547 --> 01:20:10,610
You got conned.
There is no hospitaI around here

926
01:20:10,819 --> 01:20:12,286
I know!

927
01:20:12,387 --> 01:20:15,288
He's gifting his wife
a five star dinner

928
01:20:15,324 --> 01:20:17,451
It's her 75th birthday

929
01:20:17,526 --> 01:20:20,359
She'd never been
to a fancy pIace

930
01:20:20,529 --> 01:20:23,396
He's been saving from
his pension for months

931
01:20:23,499 --> 01:20:26,832
She ordered ice-cream
and his budget went kaput

932
01:20:26,935 --> 01:20:29,870
With a restroom excuse,
he ran out for some bucks

933
01:20:29,905 --> 01:20:31,463
Another yarn!

934
01:20:32,541 --> 01:20:35,738
On our pIanet, we don't Iie

935
01:20:36,678 --> 01:20:38,475
Anyway, it's up to you

936
01:21:38,907 --> 01:21:40,499
- Here.
- Thank you Sir

937
01:21:40,576 --> 01:21:43,306
One moment. Tip him

938
01:21:43,478 --> 01:21:47,881
Why hoId back -
it's your birthday!

939
01:21:48,050 --> 01:21:49,312
Thank you

940
01:22:18,280 --> 01:22:20,305
Address.: Step-well ruins

941
01:22:44,640 --> 01:22:47,905
I toId you.
On my pIanet, we don't Iie

942
01:22:49,945 --> 01:22:52,345
Hope you haven't toId anyone...

943
01:22:59,354 --> 01:23:01,322
.. that you're an aIien?

944
01:23:01,523 --> 01:23:02,683
No way!

945
01:23:02,858 --> 01:23:07,625
They'd Iock me in a Iab,
and rip me up for research!

946
01:23:09,564 --> 01:23:12,397
How come you toId me?

947
01:23:13,869 --> 01:23:15,564
Ever since
I set foot on this pIanet

948
01:23:15,771 --> 01:23:18,763
everyone has taken
money from me

949
01:23:18,974 --> 01:23:22,466
You were the first to give it up
for me - dumping Rs 5,000 in a box

950
01:23:22,978 --> 01:23:26,641
I thought you are a good egg.
I couId trust you

951
01:23:30,018 --> 01:23:32,543
I'II get your remote back, Tipsy

952
01:23:33,755 --> 01:23:35,313
How?

953
01:23:35,624 --> 01:23:39,720
I haven't figured it out yet,
but you'II go back home

954
01:23:40,028 --> 01:23:42,462
That's my promise

955
01:24:29,789 --> 01:24:31,848
What are you goggIing at?

956
01:24:32,291 --> 01:24:33,315
You

957
01:24:34,327 --> 01:24:36,727
AIiens don't drop by everyday

958
01:24:37,964 --> 01:24:42,094
Everyone on your pIanet
has stick-out ears?

959
01:24:44,303 --> 01:24:45,827
Yup, ditto

960
01:24:45,905 --> 01:24:50,933
And they roam around naked?
Isn't it weird?

961
01:24:51,477 --> 01:24:55,174
That crow is naked -
does he Iook weird?

962
01:24:55,414 --> 01:24:58,781
If he dons a tie,
he'd Iook weird

963
01:25:00,820 --> 01:25:03,789
Tipsy, I was awake aII night...

964
01:25:04,690 --> 01:25:07,784
.. thinking how to get
your remote back

965
01:25:08,694 --> 01:25:09,319
HeIIo

966
01:25:09,695 --> 01:25:12,289
Connect to BaIbir Singh.
Room No. 4

967
01:25:12,899 --> 01:25:14,025
Wrong number

968
01:25:14,433 --> 01:25:16,128
Isn't this Fortis HospitaI?

969
01:25:16,402 --> 01:25:19,303
Since yesterday you've been
diaIing this wrong number

970
01:25:19,338 --> 01:25:23,399
ImpossibIe!
I can't be wrong every time!

971
01:25:24,710 --> 01:25:27,144
So how do we get
the remote?

972
01:25:30,349 --> 01:25:33,182
Connect to BaIbir Singh.
Room No. 4

973
01:25:33,252 --> 01:25:36,244
Sorry, Sir.
You've caIIed too Iate

974
01:25:36,722 --> 01:25:38,383
BaIbir died this morning

975
01:25:38,925 --> 01:25:43,021
Huh! How can a
piIes surgery be fataI?

976
01:25:43,296 --> 01:25:45,821
Embarrassing,
but don't worry

977
01:25:46,065 --> 01:25:48,192
Death Certificate
wiII say heart attack

978
01:25:48,401 --> 01:25:50,369
so the famiIy saves face

979
01:25:50,803 --> 01:25:52,896
- Come for the body.
- On my way

980
01:25:53,206 --> 01:25:55,037
Ok, bye

981
01:25:57,910 --> 01:25:59,343
Why did you say that?

982
01:25:59,745 --> 01:26:01,076
DoIing out joy

983
01:26:01,247 --> 01:26:05,206
When he finds his friend aIive,
imagine his joy!

984
01:26:05,284 --> 01:26:06,216
What!

985
01:26:06,352 --> 01:26:10,686
I was sick of his caIIs.
So I pIayed a prank

986
01:26:11,157 --> 01:26:14,354
- A prank?
- Tipsy, I was just kidding!

987
01:26:21,300 --> 01:26:22,858
I got it!

988
01:26:23,870 --> 01:26:27,101
Someone is pIaying pranks

989
01:26:27,406 --> 01:26:29,966
When His HoIiness diaIs God,

990
01:26:30,243 --> 01:26:33,406
cocking his head,
'God, enIighten me',

991
01:26:33,813 --> 01:26:35,940
his caIIs are going
to a Wrong Number

992
01:26:36,315 --> 01:26:39,216
Someone out there
pIays pranks

993
01:26:39,418 --> 01:26:43,445
The reaI God won't caII
my remote a bead

994
01:26:44,891 --> 01:26:51,729
Looks Iike the phone Iines
to God have gone kaput

995
01:26:51,964 --> 01:26:54,296
AII caIIs to God are going
to a Wrong Number!

996
01:26:54,734 --> 01:26:56,031
As in?

997
01:26:56,102 --> 01:27:00,436
Think - wouId the reaI God
give such weird soIutions?

998
01:27:01,007 --> 01:27:04,875
Like - come roIIing to me,
then I'II heIp you!

999
01:27:05,177 --> 01:27:07,668
Aren't we God's chiIdren?

1000
01:27:07,847 --> 01:27:13,012
WouId a father make his kids
roII for heIp?

1001
01:27:13,686 --> 01:27:18,680
Your Dad ever said - kiddo,
want a new dress? Start roIIing!

1002
01:27:19,358 --> 01:27:23,886
Another prank - bathe me
with cow's miIk! What buII!

1003
01:27:24,363 --> 01:27:30,393
And if these caIIs went to
the reaI God, what wouId He say?

1004
01:27:30,803 --> 01:27:35,399
He'd say - miIIions of my chiIdren
are starving on streets

1005
01:27:35,808 --> 01:27:38,834
Give them miIk.
Don't give me a Iactose shower

1006
01:27:39,278 --> 01:27:42,941
I'm sure someone's pIaying
pranks, Iike you just did

1007
01:27:43,382 --> 01:27:46,215
Tipsy thought His Holiness
was a victim of pranks

1008
01:27:46,452 --> 01:27:48,420
l didn't clear his confusion

1009
01:27:48,921 --> 01:27:51,719
for a crazy idea was
forming in my head

1010
01:27:51,924 --> 01:27:55,792
An idea that would
get back Tipsy's remote

1011
01:27:56,829 --> 01:27:57,921
Who's this Tipsy?

1012
01:27:58,431 --> 01:28:00,331
That's a mystery

1013
01:28:00,733 --> 01:28:03,429
But the way he sees
this worId is unique

1014
01:28:03,836 --> 01:28:06,999
- As in?
- If he saw you smoking,

1015
01:28:07,273 --> 01:28:09,833
he'd caII the cops to say
you're attempting suicide

1016
01:28:10,109 --> 01:28:10,803
Why?

1017
01:28:10,876 --> 01:28:13,936
The pack says 'Smoking KiIIs'
yet you puff away

1018
01:28:15,314 --> 01:28:17,282
So what's the big idea?

1019
01:28:19,085 --> 01:28:20,347
Face-off

1020
01:28:20,820 --> 01:28:23,687
Between
Tipsy and His HoIiness.

1021
01:28:24,023 --> 01:28:26,787
We'II take
the face-off to TV

1022
01:28:27,259 --> 01:28:29,727
Ratings wiII go
through the roof!

1023
01:28:30,363 --> 01:28:33,196
I have three trident marks
on my right bum

1024
01:28:33,733 --> 01:28:36,258
You want three more on my
Ieft for baIance?

1025
01:28:36,736 --> 01:28:37,703
Don't worry

1026
01:28:37,803 --> 01:28:42,831
Tipsy won't fight His HoIiness
but gentIy expIain, that...

1027
01:28:43,175 --> 01:28:46,201
.. his caIIs to God are going to
a Wrong Number

1028
01:28:46,779 --> 01:28:49,748
His HoIiness wiII be stumped

1029
01:28:50,249 --> 01:28:51,045
Cherry!

1030
01:28:51,384 --> 01:28:54,911
Tipsy's here.
Just meet him once

1031
01:28:55,254 --> 01:28:57,779
I bet his queries
wiII baffIe you

1032
01:28:58,057 --> 01:28:59,752
Trust me. PIease!

1033
01:29:10,236 --> 01:29:12,136
Excuse me,
you dropped this

1034
01:29:12,204 --> 01:29:13,694
Oh, thank you

1035
01:29:17,109 --> 01:29:19,270
That's not mine

1036
01:29:20,846 --> 01:29:23,679
Kamasutra condoms,
strawberry fIavor

1037
01:29:24,950 --> 01:29:27,942
I hate strawberries, man.
Ask these guys

1038
01:29:28,287 --> 01:29:30,778
It's not mine.
Buzzed bozo!

1039
01:29:32,958 --> 01:29:35,153
- Ma'am, yours?
- How dare you!

1040
01:29:35,361 --> 01:29:39,730
- Check your purse if it's missing.
- ShameIess cad!

1041
01:29:40,699 --> 01:29:43,395
- Has to be yours.
- No, not mine

1042
01:29:43,836 --> 01:29:45,394
Tipsy, it's his

1043
01:29:45,805 --> 01:29:50,208
Ask him aII you want
to know about it. Come on in

1044
01:29:54,713 --> 01:29:55,805
What's this?

1045
01:29:56,882 --> 01:29:58,372
It's a condom

1046
01:29:58,784 --> 01:30:03,448
- What does it do?
- ControIs the worId's popuIation

1047
01:30:04,090 --> 01:30:05,079
How?

1048
01:30:05,658 --> 01:30:09,924
It has to be worn
whiIe having sex

1049
01:30:12,231 --> 01:30:15,359
How does your wearing it
controI the worId's popuIation?

1050
01:30:15,668 --> 01:30:18,831
Not just me...
miIIions wear it

1051
01:30:19,038 --> 01:30:21,006
They aII borrow it from you?

1052
01:30:21,207 --> 01:30:23,072
No. Everyone has it

1053
01:30:23,375 --> 01:30:27,243
- I've a question
- Go on Tipsy, shoot

1054
01:30:27,680 --> 01:30:31,844
If money is dropped,
aII run for it

1055
01:30:31,951 --> 01:30:37,218
If a condom is dropped,
aII run away from it. Why?

1056
01:30:37,790 --> 01:30:40,122
Sex is a very private matter

1057
01:30:40,259 --> 01:30:41,726
Why?

1058
01:30:41,861 --> 01:30:45,228
You don't teII the whoIe town -
I'm having sex today

1059
01:30:45,731 --> 01:30:50,725
But, then at weddings,
with fireworks and music bands

1060
01:30:50,769 --> 01:30:55,729
why do they teII the whoIe town -
I'm having sex today?

1061
01:30:57,843 --> 01:30:59,174
What's the matter?

1062
01:30:59,945 --> 01:31:04,905
I have no answer for you
but I have a job for you

1063
01:31:05,851 --> 01:31:07,318
Thank you!

1064
01:31:08,320 --> 01:31:11,915
Let's beat it before
he changes his mind

1065
01:31:13,859 --> 01:31:16,293
ShieId your hoIy bum,
Your HoIiness

1066
01:31:16,662 --> 01:31:18,653
My trident is on its way

1067
01:31:22,401 --> 01:31:25,962
At this pIace His HoIiness
connects his devotees to God

1068
01:31:26,105 --> 01:31:27,936
for soIutions to their woes

1069
01:31:28,274 --> 01:31:31,141
Listen carefuIIy to his caIIs

1070
01:31:31,243 --> 01:31:37,705
If you think the caIIs are going
to a Wrong Number, aIert him

1071
01:31:38,050 --> 01:31:41,679
- WiII that get me my remote?
- Once he reaIises...

1072
01:31:41,754 --> 01:31:46,282
.. the bead story is a prank
he'II return your remote

1073
01:31:46,358 --> 01:31:49,418
Good pIan. Let's go

1074
01:31:50,896 --> 01:31:53,956
To buiId a home for someone
is a hoIy deed

1075
01:31:54,033 --> 01:31:58,697
To buiId a home for God
is the hoIiest deed

1076
01:31:59,104 --> 01:32:01,800
So donate for the tempIe

1077
01:32:02,007 --> 01:32:04,805
And see
your woes fIee

1078
01:32:05,644 --> 01:32:09,102
Son, voice your woe

1079
01:32:10,082 --> 01:32:11,379
Your HoIiness,

1080
01:32:12,117 --> 01:32:14,711
my wife's been paraIyzed
for six months

1081
01:32:14,987 --> 01:32:18,718
The doctors have given up.
What shaII I...

1082
01:32:20,192 --> 01:32:21,819
God

1083
01:32:22,661 --> 01:32:23,923
EnIighten me

1084
01:32:31,003 --> 01:32:32,334
Yes...

1085
01:32:35,774 --> 01:32:37,935
What pIace?

1086
01:32:42,781 --> 01:32:44,749
What transport?

1087
01:32:47,286 --> 01:32:49,720
Your wish is our command

1088
01:32:52,358 --> 01:32:54,986
Have you heard of
the Rathong gIacier?

1089
01:32:55,060 --> 01:32:56,254
No

1090
01:32:56,762 --> 01:33:01,165
It's in the HimaIayas.
Take a train to SiIIiguri

1091
01:33:02,001 --> 01:33:04,765
then a bus to Gangtok

1092
01:33:05,638 --> 01:33:10,075
then an eight day trek

1093
01:33:10,709 --> 01:33:15,203
You'II reach a grand tempIe

1094
01:33:16,148 --> 01:33:19,311
Pray there,
your probIem wiII be soIved

1095
01:33:19,652 --> 01:33:21,950
Wrong Number!
This is a Wrong Number!

1096
01:33:22,254 --> 01:33:24,119
- What?
- Wrong Number

1097
01:33:24,390 --> 01:33:29,828
Your HoIiness, your phone Iine
to God has gone kaput

1098
01:33:30,663 --> 01:33:32,722
Your caIIs are going to
a Wrong Number

1099
01:33:32,931 --> 01:33:36,765
and a fake God is
pIaying pranks

1100
01:33:36,902 --> 01:33:40,099
What are you trying to say?

1101
01:33:40,372 --> 01:33:43,273
I'II expIain.
Aren't we God's chiIdren?

1102
01:33:43,976 --> 01:33:44,943
Yes, so?

1103
01:33:45,144 --> 01:33:48,875
Say your kid's in a jam
and comes to you

1104
01:33:49,214 --> 01:33:51,944
WiII you heIp promptIy,
or wiII you say

1105
01:33:52,084 --> 01:33:55,349
kiddo, I've another house
2,000 miIes away

1106
01:33:55,688 --> 01:33:58,714
Come there, teII me
the same probIem again

1107
01:33:58,924 --> 01:34:01,290
Then I'II soIve it.
What buII!

1108
01:34:01,727 --> 01:34:06,926
If the caII went to reaI God, He'd
say: Son, tend to your aiIing wife,

1109
01:34:07,266 --> 01:34:09,734
don't run after me

1110
01:34:09,935 --> 01:34:12,927
after death
you'II come to me anyway

1111
01:34:13,072 --> 01:34:16,769
give her your time now. Right?

1112
01:34:20,979 --> 01:34:23,413
I can prove it's a prank

1113
01:34:23,749 --> 01:34:26,980
CaII this fake God
again and ask

1114
01:34:27,252 --> 01:34:29,846
What's the guarantee
she wiII get weII

1115
01:34:30,055 --> 01:34:34,116
Sir, tiII you get it in writing,
don't Ieave her side

1116
01:34:34,293 --> 01:34:37,262
Just caII,
and cIear aII doubt

1117
01:34:38,230 --> 01:34:41,461
It's time for His HoIiness'
hoIy siIence

1118
01:34:43,235 --> 01:34:52,337
Praise be to God
Glory be to God

1119
01:34:55,047 --> 01:35:00,007
This fake God is passing off
my property as a hoIy bead

1120
01:35:00,319 --> 01:35:03,254
He's pIaying a prank

1121
01:35:04,757 --> 01:35:07,282
He is no God.
He is a fraud

1122
01:35:07,960 --> 01:35:09,951
He is a FRAUD

1123
01:35:10,162 --> 01:35:13,825
God doesn't taIk
to us mortaIs

1124
01:35:14,400 --> 01:35:18,097
He communicates
through His managers

1125
01:35:18,704 --> 01:35:22,037
- Tipsy has raised a big question.
- What?

1126
01:35:23,442 --> 01:35:26,809
Is God reaIIy taIking
to the managers?

1127
01:35:26,879 --> 01:35:27,777
No

1128
01:35:27,846 --> 01:35:32,044
So where do the commands
for us come from?

1129
01:35:32,351 --> 01:35:36,014
- From a Wrong Number!
- So what shouId the pubIic do?

1130
01:35:36,221 --> 01:35:40,021
TiII phone Iines are fixed,
don't depend on God's managers

1131
01:35:40,092 --> 01:35:42,788
HeIp each other
in difficuIt times

1132
01:35:43,095 --> 01:35:50,160
A great tip from Tipsy:
Don't reIy on God's managers

1133
01:35:50,369 --> 01:35:53,361
ReIy on each other

1134
01:35:55,474 --> 01:35:59,308
Hail Lord Shiva

1135
01:36:00,746 --> 01:36:05,115
Tipsy says don't make the tempIe,
the bead beIongs to him

1136
01:36:05,250 --> 01:36:07,309
What's in your pocket?

1137
01:36:09,855 --> 01:36:12,688
- Do you smoke?
- Yes

1138
01:36:12,858 --> 01:36:16,988
- You consume aIcohoI?
- OccasionaIIy

1139
01:36:17,196 --> 01:36:20,393
You smoke cigarettes,
consume aIcohoI

1140
01:36:20,432 --> 01:36:24,129
despite knowing
their fataI effects

1141
01:36:25,003 --> 01:36:27,198
Governments
permit these poisons,

1142
01:36:27,739 --> 01:36:32,904
factories manufacture them,
stores seII them

1143
01:36:33,011 --> 01:36:35,172
Nobody questions this

1144
01:36:35,414 --> 01:36:43,014
But in this sacred Iand of
Lord Ram and Krishna

1145
01:36:43,121 --> 01:36:45,851
if I wish to buiId a tempIe

1146
01:36:46,725 --> 01:36:48,420
why these questions?

1147
01:36:49,261 --> 01:36:56,758
Why not question the man
who is trying to staII this tempIe?

1148
01:36:57,002 --> 01:36:58,731
Who's this Tipsy?

1149
01:36:59,104 --> 01:37:01,163
What's his reaI name?

1150
01:37:02,441 --> 01:37:06,673
Why's he hiding it?
Is he a MusIim?

1151
01:37:07,279 --> 01:37:11,682
If question you must,
go ask Tipsy

1152
01:37:11,717 --> 01:37:13,309
what is his reIigion?

1153
01:37:13,752 --> 01:37:17,984
Find out his reIigion,
Find out his faith

1154
01:37:20,893 --> 01:37:23,862
Centuries ago,
Mohammad of Ghazni

1155
01:37:24,730 --> 01:37:26,755
came and destroyed
our tempIes

1156
01:37:27,232 --> 01:37:31,828
Today another invader
wants to repeat history

1157
01:37:32,004 --> 01:37:33,164
But we won't aIIow...

1158
01:38:00,098 --> 01:38:04,660
Your God asks my reIigion.
Let's ask Him...

1159
01:38:04,770 --> 01:38:07,102
.. the reIigions of these peopIe

1160
01:38:07,205 --> 01:38:11,665
- What nonsense?
- CaII up your God!

1161
01:38:11,710 --> 01:38:16,147
Why bother God?
I'II teII you

1162
01:38:16,381 --> 01:38:18,281
This one is a Hindu.
He's a Christian...

1163
01:38:18,717 --> 01:38:20,309
.. Sikh, Jain and...

1164
01:38:20,719 --> 01:38:23,347
.. that one is of your reIigion

1165
01:38:25,123 --> 01:38:27,819
EnIighten him

1166
01:38:28,226 --> 01:38:31,718
HeIIo. I'm Sikh

1167
01:38:31,964 --> 01:38:35,229
Greetings.
I'm MusIim

1168
01:38:35,701 --> 01:38:37,726
I'm Jain

1169
01:38:37,803 --> 01:38:40,169
Hi,
I'm Christian

1170
01:38:40,806 --> 01:38:44,037
HeIIo! I'm Hindu

1171
01:38:44,710 --> 01:38:46,007
BamboozIed!

1172
01:38:46,311 --> 01:38:50,008
I swapped their robes.
Get it?

1173
01:38:50,215 --> 01:38:52,206
Faith is connected
to fashion

1174
01:38:52,284 --> 01:38:55,378
Want a demo?
Check the math

1175
01:38:56,054 --> 01:38:58,784
Beard + moustache + turban = Sikh

1176
01:38:59,191 --> 01:39:01,887
Minus turban = Hindu

1177
01:39:02,060 --> 01:39:05,223
Minus moustache = MusIim!

1178
01:39:05,964 --> 01:39:08,956
This difference is
made by the fake God

1179
01:39:09,234 --> 01:39:11,702
If reaI God wanted it,
He'd put a IabeI on us

1180
01:39:11,770 --> 01:39:14,762
- Is there a IabeI on your body?
- Mine?

1181
01:39:14,840 --> 01:39:17,934
Don't gape, strip and check!

1182
01:39:18,243 --> 01:39:20,177
Why be coy?

1183
01:39:20,779 --> 01:39:25,682
Strip everyone, show His HoIiness.
Is there any IabeI?

1184
01:39:25,984 --> 01:39:29,886
Cut the coyness.
OK, I'II go first

1185
01:39:32,257 --> 01:39:34,885
See the bare facts

1186
01:39:36,028 --> 01:39:40,931
Is there a IabeI?

1187
01:39:41,767 --> 01:39:43,234
Nothing! You see!

1188
01:39:43,435 --> 01:39:45,130
Check some more...

1189
01:39:45,737 --> 01:39:47,830
Remove this ruffian

1190
01:39:48,206 --> 01:39:51,300
Hey!
I'm proving a point

1191
01:39:51,410 --> 01:39:53,401
Start the chants!

1192
01:39:53,779 --> 01:39:56,270
Praise be to God
Glory be to God

1193
01:39:56,415 --> 01:40:00,317
That's no divine bead

1194
01:40:08,226 --> 01:40:09,284
Jaggu!

1195
01:40:10,395 --> 01:40:11,885
Stop this farce!

1196
01:40:12,264 --> 01:40:13,253
Papa!

1197
01:40:15,701 --> 01:40:19,797
You were aII of 40 days, when
His HoIiness christened you

1198
01:40:19,938 --> 01:40:23,738
Remember, he who gives you
a name, can ruin it too

1199
01:40:24,309 --> 01:40:26,675
He named me
Jagat Janani

1200
01:40:26,912 --> 01:40:28,345
How can he ruin it further?

1201
01:40:28,747 --> 01:40:31,739
You!
Name your price

1202
01:40:31,983 --> 01:40:32,677
Papa!

1203
01:40:32,851 --> 01:40:35,718
Trying to scare His HoIiness
to extort money

1204
01:40:35,887 --> 01:40:36,353
No, no

1205
01:40:36,788 --> 01:40:41,691
You'II burn in HeII!
Fear the wrath of God!

1206
01:40:46,765 --> 01:40:49,290
Thank you Papa!
Thank you

1207
01:40:50,135 --> 01:40:53,764
I'd soIved onIy haIf the puzzIe.
You pieced it together

1208
01:40:53,972 --> 01:40:55,701
Fear is the key

1209
01:40:55,907 --> 01:41:01,209
The prankster is
cashing in on fear. Get it?

1210
01:41:01,813 --> 01:41:04,179
Not exactIy,
but can you expIain to Papa?

1211
01:41:04,282 --> 01:41:08,241
You bet! I can prove it.
FoIIow me

1212
01:41:09,654 --> 01:41:11,679
I don't have time
for this nonsense

1213
01:41:11,957 --> 01:41:15,950
If it turns out to be nonsense,
I'II caII off the show

1214
01:41:28,807 --> 01:41:33,107
Exams are on at this coIIege.
The students are scared stiff

1215
01:41:33,345 --> 01:41:38,282
Now, we'II estabIish our business -
The Fear Factory

1216
01:41:49,427 --> 01:41:51,918
Machine instaIIed

1217
01:41:56,968 --> 01:41:59,835
A IittIe seed capitaI

1218
01:42:03,708 --> 01:42:07,166
Now the inauguration

1219
01:42:16,288 --> 01:42:21,191
Just watch!
CapitaI doubIes in 15 minutes

1220
01:42:27,132 --> 01:42:28,690
Look there

1221
01:42:30,769 --> 01:42:32,293
The first customer!

1222
01:42:33,004 --> 01:42:36,269
Tea... piping hot tea

1223
01:42:36,775 --> 01:42:39,039
Check the investment
of the tea vendor

1224
01:42:39,344 --> 01:42:42,780
KettIe, tea, sugar, bike,
thermos

1225
01:42:43,114 --> 01:42:46,777
And here -
a rock and a red mark

1226
01:42:46,985 --> 01:42:48,782
Hot and piping tea...

1227
01:42:48,954 --> 01:42:51,115
There, you gotta
woo the cIients

1228
01:42:51,356 --> 01:42:54,223
Here you shoo them away

1229
01:42:54,359 --> 01:42:58,728
Hey, scram.
Give others a chance

1230
01:43:01,233 --> 01:43:03,701
There you bow
before the customer

1231
01:43:03,802 --> 01:43:06,066
Here the customer
bows before you

1232
01:43:08,673 --> 01:43:12,734
If he's in deep troubIe,
he goes horizontaI

1233
01:43:13,812 --> 01:43:18,181
The Wrong Number guy
trades in fear

1234
01:43:18,650 --> 01:43:21,676
He knows - those in dread
to the tempIe head

1235
01:43:22,287 --> 01:43:25,222
You too seem afraid!
Off with these...

1236
01:43:26,658 --> 01:43:29,092
Do not question reIigion

1237
01:43:29,761 --> 01:43:31,888
It's a matter of faith!

1238
01:43:32,097 --> 01:43:34,793
If God didn't want us
to raise questions

1239
01:43:34,900 --> 01:43:38,927
He wouIdn't give us
the power to reason

1240
01:43:39,304 --> 01:43:43,138
Guardians of reIigion use vioIence
when they can't answer us

1241
01:43:43,308 --> 01:43:47,267
They scare us into siIence.
But now we won't be siIent

1242
01:43:47,712 --> 01:43:52,274
So far one Tipsy raised questions.
Now there'II be a thousand

1243
01:43:52,751 --> 01:43:55,219
Friends, pick up your phones

1244
01:43:55,687 --> 01:44:00,420
When you spot a Wrong Number,
shoot it and send it to us

1245
01:44:00,959 --> 01:44:03,154
We'II put it on TV

1246
01:44:03,695 --> 01:44:06,220
Dump your fear,
ask questions

1247
01:44:15,307 --> 01:44:17,241
HoIy Sir!

1248
01:44:17,742 --> 01:44:18,970
One question

1249
01:44:19,044 --> 01:44:21,342
If you can conjure goId
from thin air

1250
01:44:21,746 --> 01:44:24,374
why don't you end
the nation's poverty?

1251
01:44:24,783 --> 01:44:26,717
Answer pIease

1252
01:44:27,319 --> 01:44:28,308
HoIy Sir!

1253
01:44:28,386 --> 01:44:33,255
Since you're a waIking goId mine,
why ask us for donations?

1254
01:44:35,794 --> 01:44:38,092
God is great!

1255
01:44:38,330 --> 01:44:40,730
This is a Wrong Number

1256
01:44:40,865 --> 01:44:44,301
- Jaggu... come with me
- Cherry give me a moment

1257
01:44:44,736 --> 01:44:48,433
Come with me

1258
01:44:48,740 --> 01:44:50,469
The Wrong Number idea
is a nationaI rage

1259
01:44:51,042 --> 01:44:54,375
- What!
- It's spread Iike wiId fire

1260
01:44:59,918 --> 01:45:02,751
Guru says - to Iand a job,
feed a cow

1261
01:45:02,954 --> 01:45:06,321
Is this cow
an empIoyment agent?

1262
01:45:06,691 --> 01:45:10,286
Or posts CVs on Monster.com?
Wrong Number

1263
01:45:10,395 --> 01:45:11,692
Watch this one!

1264
01:45:11,997 --> 01:45:14,795
He says, convert to
Christianity, or be damned

1265
01:45:15,133 --> 01:45:18,830
If God wanted,
I'd be Christian by birth

1266
01:45:19,204 --> 01:45:22,401
Why convert now?
Wrong Number

1267
01:45:22,941 --> 01:45:24,806
These girIs want to
go to schooI

1268
01:45:25,076 --> 01:45:28,170
A new dictat says:
kiII them if they do

1269
01:45:28,346 --> 01:45:33,010
Is God so smaII,
He'II deny chiIdren knowIedge?

1270
01:45:33,718 --> 01:45:35,208
Wrong Number

1271
01:45:35,854 --> 01:45:39,187
What God has destined for you
wiII happen

1272
01:45:39,724 --> 01:45:43,785
He has a master pIan
for the Universe

1273
01:45:44,229 --> 01:45:45,958
Accept it

1274
01:45:46,164 --> 01:45:50,760
Your discipIes say:
to get a maIe chiId,

1275
01:45:50,902 --> 01:45:55,305
buy this book,
and chant the mantras

1276
01:45:55,740 --> 01:45:59,176
So buy a Rs 10 book

1277
01:45:59,244 --> 01:46:03,078
and bust
God's master pIan!

1278
01:46:11,289 --> 01:46:15,419
Tipsy! Your show's a hit!
Messages are pouring in

1279
01:46:15,760 --> 01:46:17,352
Here's one more

1280
01:46:22,333 --> 01:46:23,698
What happened?

1281
01:46:24,402 --> 01:46:28,361
It's Papa. He's ashamed
I'm his daughter

1282
01:46:32,210 --> 01:46:34,906
I was in tenth grade

1283
01:46:36,114 --> 01:46:38,810
when I wrote my first poem

1284
01:46:39,384 --> 01:46:41,443
For Papa

1285
01:46:42,420 --> 01:46:47,915
They say my Mom l resemble.
l say possible,

1286
01:46:48,760 --> 01:46:51,888
but l'm my Daddy's girl

1287
01:46:52,197 --> 01:46:54,722
I recited it
on the AnnuaI Day

1288
01:46:55,200 --> 01:46:57,225
AII parents cIapped

1289
01:46:57,735 --> 01:47:01,728
but one whistIed with joy

1290
01:47:02,874 --> 01:47:06,867
The appIause ended,
the whistIing continued

1291
01:47:07,846 --> 01:47:09,313
It was Papa

1292
01:47:09,881 --> 01:47:11,906
He was so proud of me

1293
01:47:13,284 --> 01:47:17,846
And now this message.
Ashamed of you

1294
01:47:18,389 --> 01:47:23,725
There's a Wrong Number
in your Papa's head

1295
01:47:24,329 --> 01:47:29,961
The day he gets rid of it,
he'II whistIe for you again

1296
01:47:30,335 --> 01:47:32,064
It won't happen

1297
01:47:32,737 --> 01:47:35,706
Don't be sad. Come with me

1298
01:47:35,740 --> 01:47:39,938
On my pIanet when peopIe are sad,
know what they do?

1299
01:47:40,311 --> 01:47:41,801
What?

1300
01:47:42,046 --> 01:47:44,810
Recharge the battery!

1301
01:47:45,049 --> 01:47:47,847
- What!
- Just copy me

1302
01:47:52,991 --> 01:47:54,720
What are we doing?

1303
01:48:00,732 --> 01:48:02,324
Shut your eyes!

1304
01:48:02,433 --> 01:48:04,162
How do I copy then?

1305
01:48:04,235 --> 01:48:06,135
Right.
Keep them open

1306
01:49:40,365 --> 01:49:43,357
To steal glances at you all day

1307
01:49:43,768 --> 01:49:46,396
To strain for every word you say

1308
01:49:46,871 --> 01:49:49,806
To put every chore aside

1309
01:49:50,074 --> 01:49:53,043
And follow your every stride

1310
01:49:53,211 --> 01:49:55,873
That's nothing but a
waste of time

1311
01:49:56,314 --> 01:49:59,147
Love is a waste of time

1312
01:49:59,717 --> 01:50:02,151
Amore is nothing more

1313
01:50:02,720 --> 01:50:05,655
Love is a waste of time

1314
01:50:06,057 --> 01:50:09,049
But my mind and heart insist

1315
01:50:09,260 --> 01:50:12,093
Once in this life at least

1316
01:50:12,664 --> 01:50:14,928
l must waste my time

1317
01:50:15,266 --> 01:50:17,996
Without reason or rhyme

1318
01:50:18,403 --> 01:50:21,270
l want to waste my time

1319
01:50:21,706 --> 01:50:24,197
l love this waste of time

1320
01:50:41,326 --> 01:50:45,786
A zillion peeps into the mirror

1321
01:50:47,765 --> 01:50:52,395
A million times
l've styled my hair

1322
01:50:54,205 --> 01:50:59,336
Countless sets of
clothes l've tried

1323
01:51:00,712 --> 01:51:05,115
Emptied perfume
bottles with flair

1324
01:51:06,784 --> 01:51:12,654
Dressing up is all l did
Did nothing else worthwhile

1325
01:51:13,324 --> 01:51:16,157
Now l understand

1326
01:51:16,394 --> 01:51:19,124
That love is waste of time

1327
01:51:19,664 --> 01:51:22,656
But my mind and heart insist

1328
01:51:22,867 --> 01:51:25,859
Once in this life at least

1329
01:51:26,137 --> 01:51:28,697
l must waste my time

1330
01:51:28,873 --> 01:51:31,740
Without reason or rhyme

1331
01:51:32,110 --> 01:51:34,977
l want to waste my time

1332
01:51:35,279 --> 01:51:38,680
l love this waste of time

1333
01:52:14,118 --> 01:52:18,782
My world has
topsy-turvy turned

1334
01:52:20,825 --> 01:52:25,762
l know not how to tell you

1335
01:52:27,131 --> 01:52:32,125
l smile without rhyme
or reason

1336
01:52:33,337 --> 01:52:38,001
What's happening
l have no clue

1337
01:52:39,844 --> 01:52:45,680
The mind just wants to soar
And from rooftops yell

1338
01:52:46,184 --> 01:52:52,282
Now l understand
Love is a waste of time

1339
01:52:52,690 --> 01:52:55,784
But my mind and heart insist

1340
01:52:55,927 --> 01:52:58,828
Once in this life at least

1341
01:52:59,063 --> 01:53:01,224
l must waste my time

1342
01:53:02,133 --> 01:53:04,727
Without reason or rhyme

1343
01:53:04,902 --> 01:53:07,962
l want to waste my time

1344
01:53:08,206 --> 01:53:11,698
l love this waste of time

1345
01:53:51,249 --> 01:53:54,412
The donation box is getting
more questions than cash

1346
01:53:54,852 --> 01:53:59,755
Your reIics don't seII anymore

1347
01:54:00,157 --> 01:54:04,253
MiIIions of abuses on
Facebook and Twitter

1348
01:54:05,830 --> 01:54:09,095
- Just five?
- Those are in support

1349
01:54:09,433 --> 01:54:11,401
The abuses are in here

1350
01:54:12,103 --> 01:54:18,269
It's time for action, Sir.
Avoiding the issue can be disastrous

1351
01:54:22,947 --> 01:54:24,437
Missing.: God

1352
01:54:24,849 --> 01:54:26,248
CaII Cherry Bajwa

1353
01:54:26,951 --> 01:54:30,819
Tipsy has asked many questions.
I'II ask him just one

1354
01:54:30,988 --> 01:54:33,923
- Hey Jaggu
- What happened?

1355
01:54:34,892 --> 01:54:38,293
His HoIiness wants to come
on the show. To debate with Tipsy

1356
01:54:38,429 --> 01:54:41,193
- Tipsy'II rip him!
- It'II be a mother of a show!

1357
01:54:41,432 --> 01:54:44,890
Get Tipsy ready.
Put the promos out

1358
01:54:45,169 --> 01:54:48,969
'The Final Question'
Sunday 6:00 pm

1359
01:54:50,875 --> 01:54:55,335
Don't miss, 'The Final Question'
Sunday 6:00 pm

1360
01:54:55,446 --> 01:55:00,281
My paI's become a star!
Hey Iook, he's a rock star

1361
01:55:00,418 --> 01:55:04,184
Rock star was
roaming butt naked

1362
01:55:04,388 --> 01:55:09,690
I made him a star.
The bIoke's on TV

1363
01:55:10,127 --> 01:55:16,225
and me - in this shanty town,
this crappy shack

1364
01:55:16,701 --> 01:55:21,035
guzzIing booze with
a jackass Iike you

1365
01:55:21,138 --> 01:55:23,299
Star my foot!

1366
01:55:39,357 --> 01:55:41,917
Tipsy, some
Bhairon Singh for you

1367
01:55:42,193 --> 01:55:43,285
Bhairon!

1368
01:55:43,427 --> 01:55:45,258
Take that Iine

1369
01:55:46,731 --> 01:55:49,029
- Bro!
- You Iusty Iad

1370
01:55:49,233 --> 01:55:51,201
You're a rock star!

1371
01:55:51,335 --> 01:55:53,735
Bro, where are you?

1372
01:55:53,838 --> 01:55:56,932
In Mandawa.
Coming to DeIhi tomorrow

1373
01:55:57,174 --> 01:55:59,938
With a gift for you

1374
01:56:00,277 --> 01:56:04,680
I've nabbed the thief
who stoIe your stuff

1375
01:56:04,949 --> 01:56:07,918
He soId it for 40 grand

1376
01:56:08,419 --> 01:56:10,751
- Guess to whom.
- Whom?

1377
01:56:11,222 --> 01:56:14,680
His HoIiness!

1378
01:56:16,861 --> 01:56:23,824
God said.: it's a divine bead
from Lord Shiva's necklace. Take it...

1379
01:56:24,268 --> 01:56:30,070
.. and enshrine it in a grand temple.
Sighting this bead...

1380
01:56:30,241 --> 01:56:31,708
Hey,

1381
01:56:32,910 --> 01:56:35,071
what happened?

1382
01:56:35,446 --> 01:56:39,246
The thief who stoIe
my remote is caught

1383
01:56:39,417 --> 01:56:40,907
What! ReaIIy?

1384
01:56:41,085 --> 01:56:46,421
Bro said, the thief soId it to
His HoIiness

1385
01:56:46,724 --> 01:56:48,419
Then His HoIiness is finished!

1386
01:56:49,160 --> 01:56:52,994
We'II teII him -
return the remote,

1387
01:56:53,264 --> 01:56:55,732
or the thief teIIs aII on TV

1388
01:56:56,333 --> 01:57:01,896
So he didn't find my remote
in the HimaIayas! He's Iying

1389
01:57:02,907 --> 01:57:07,003
Wrong Numbers are not
fIoated by some fake God...

1390
01:57:07,411 --> 01:57:09,777
.. but by His HoIiness

1391
01:57:12,116 --> 01:57:14,380
You knew this Jaggu?

1392
01:57:14,685 --> 01:57:16,983
Remember the day
you mentioned Wrong Number

1393
01:57:17,254 --> 01:57:22,214
All his calls are going
to a Wrong Number

1394
01:57:22,426 --> 01:57:27,159
I knew then you were on the
wrong track. But I kept mum

1395
01:57:27,398 --> 01:57:31,164
If you'd caIIed him a fraud,
peopIe wouId have kiIIed you

1396
01:57:31,335 --> 01:57:33,428
PeopIe crave for the unique

1397
01:57:33,771 --> 01:57:35,295
Wrong Number!

1398
01:57:35,706 --> 01:57:38,402
Your Wrong Number
concept was unique

1399
01:57:38,809 --> 01:57:41,277
Today the worId supports you

1400
01:57:41,412 --> 01:57:46,042
Tipsy, my pIan worked!
You're going home!

1401
01:57:50,788 --> 01:57:54,155
You'II fIy away tomorrow,
my friend

1402
01:57:54,391 --> 01:57:57,224
Whoosh... gone

1403
01:57:58,929 --> 01:58:01,796
We'II never meet again

1404
01:58:03,267 --> 01:58:06,327
There wiII be such a void

1405
01:58:07,671 --> 01:58:10,299
I'II reaIIy miss you

1406
01:58:12,076 --> 01:58:14,135
ShaII I stay back?

1407
01:58:17,014 --> 01:58:19,676
How can you?

1408
01:58:20,351 --> 01:58:23,787
SimpIe,
I have a job

1409
01:58:24,255 --> 01:58:27,315
I'II get some ID made
and settIe here

1410
01:58:27,825 --> 01:58:32,023
I'II find someone to
'waste time' with me

1411
01:58:32,696 --> 01:58:35,062
I'II marry her

1412
01:58:35,332 --> 01:58:38,062
- Who'II marry you!
- Why not?

1413
01:58:38,369 --> 01:58:42,897
Your wife wiII go nuts
introducing you -

1414
01:58:43,707 --> 01:58:47,234
Meet my husband.
He's Tipsy!

1415
01:58:48,212 --> 01:58:51,409
That's not my name!

1416
01:58:51,715 --> 01:58:54,309
- Tipsyyy!
- I'II get a reaI name

1417
01:58:55,719 --> 01:59:01,351
Why don't you suggest one?
A name you Iove

1418
01:59:02,126 --> 01:59:07,792
A man's name must
match his personaIity

1419
01:59:07,998 --> 01:59:09,659
Right!

1420
01:59:09,800 --> 01:59:12,291
So how is my personaIity?

1421
01:59:12,736 --> 01:59:14,670
I'II expIain

1422
01:59:15,239 --> 01:59:17,901
A poet once wrote...

1423
01:59:19,677 --> 01:59:22,669
lrony of mismatched names...

1424
01:59:22,847 --> 01:59:26,112
No poetry, pIease!
I've something to say

1425
01:59:26,784 --> 01:59:31,221
Who says
'What's in a name?'

1426
01:59:32,790 --> 01:59:36,419
lf you don't get the right one,
what a pain

1427
01:59:37,428 --> 01:59:41,364
Mr Burns is in fact so cool

1428
01:59:41,832 --> 01:59:44,699
With violence alone
Mr Peace does rule

1429
01:59:46,036 --> 01:59:51,702
His name is Mr Fox
But has no bushy tail

1430
01:59:52,710 --> 01:59:57,272
''l love you Jaggu''

1431
01:59:57,715 --> 02:00:01,708
One whole ton is the
weight of Mr Flower

1432
02:00:02,186 --> 02:00:05,986
At his mere sight,
the poor chair does cower

1433
02:00:06,156 --> 02:00:07,851
Very nice... very nice

1434
02:00:08,092 --> 02:00:11,687
Here's a bunch of cards
with different names

1435
02:00:11,996 --> 02:00:15,363
Pick the one you Iike

1436
02:00:15,699 --> 02:00:18,224
Danduram Thatte?

1437
02:00:18,769 --> 02:00:21,169
- Disaster!
- Next!

1438
02:00:21,939 --> 02:00:23,702
Tutari Singh?

1439
02:00:24,008 --> 02:00:25,771
Phooey!

1440
02:00:26,844 --> 02:00:28,334
Sarfaraz

1441
02:00:32,850 --> 02:00:35,375
- Sarfaraz...
- What happened?

1442
02:00:35,786 --> 02:00:38,448
Keep going,
find a good name

1443
02:00:41,926 --> 02:00:43,416
What's the matter?

1444
02:00:44,128 --> 02:00:45,789
Nothing

1445
02:01:38,215 --> 02:01:40,115
''l love you Jaggu''

1446
02:01:54,231 --> 02:01:55,994
Brother!

1447
02:02:28,665 --> 02:02:32,226
God is in His Heaven
We mortals on ground

1448
02:02:32,703 --> 02:02:35,968
God is in His Heaven
We mortals on ground

1449
02:02:36,673 --> 02:02:40,666
Nowadays He doesn't have
Time to look around

1450
02:02:40,811 --> 02:02:44,804
God is in His Heaven
We mortals on ground

1451
02:02:52,890 --> 02:02:56,326
Whatever may happen here
He does not reprimand

1452
02:02:56,827 --> 02:03:00,820
Thousand evils, million wrongs
He does not take a stand

1453
02:03:01,031 --> 02:03:05,297
Plundering is all around
Bombs come to hound

1454
02:03:52,950 --> 02:03:56,283
A terrorist outfit has claimed
responsibility for the blast

1455
02:03:56,720 --> 02:03:59,848
They say this was
a mock drill

1456
02:04:00,324 --> 02:04:03,020
Persecute our people,
and real war will follow

1457
02:04:03,327 --> 02:04:06,296
We shall protect our God

1458
02:04:27,751 --> 02:04:29,912
Where are you
going, Tipsy?

1459
02:04:30,754 --> 02:04:31,948
On the show

1460
02:04:32,222 --> 02:04:34,247
You don't have to

1461
02:04:36,727 --> 02:04:39,161
I must.
More than ever

1462
02:04:53,777 --> 02:04:59,010
'The Final Question'
WeIcome to our speciaI show

1463
02:04:59,216 --> 02:05:00,774
in which we meet Tipsy...

1464
02:05:00,851 --> 02:05:02,876
Wait a minute

1465
02:05:08,759 --> 02:05:10,693
Bring it

1466
02:05:16,166 --> 02:05:17,963
What is this?

1467
02:05:18,235 --> 02:05:22,899
God says: it's a divine bead
from His neckIace

1468
02:05:23,173 --> 02:05:26,802
This man cIaims,
it's his property

1469
02:05:27,711 --> 02:05:31,044
God says: buiId a tempIe

1470
02:05:31,715 --> 02:05:35,082
And this man opposes it

1471
02:05:35,319 --> 02:05:40,780
Who do I Iisten to?
God, or this gentIeman

1472
02:05:41,158 --> 02:05:46,926
who used to hand out these
bIasphemous pamphIets?

1473
02:05:48,298 --> 02:05:51,324
First he cIaimed,
God is missing

1474
02:05:52,035 --> 02:05:54,003
Then said, God is a fraud

1475
02:05:54,238 --> 02:05:58,004
Next he'II say,
God is dead

1476
02:05:59,409 --> 02:06:04,938
What do you want, son?
A worId without God?

1477
02:06:07,117 --> 02:06:11,713
Do you have any cIue
how peopIe suffer?

1478
02:06:12,055 --> 02:06:14,319
No food to eat

1479
02:06:15,025 --> 02:06:17,016
No pIace to Iive

1480
02:06:17,928 --> 02:06:20,726
No friend to taIk to

1481
02:06:21,198 --> 02:06:27,831
PeopIe kiII themseIves.
SIit their wrists, jump off buiIdings

1482
02:06:28,138 --> 02:06:32,131
Why?
Because they have no hope

1483
02:06:32,709 --> 02:06:37,146
If bowing before God,
smearing hoIy ash,

1484
02:06:37,914 --> 02:06:42,715
wearing amuIets,
gives them hope to Iive,

1485
02:06:42,919 --> 02:06:47,720
then who are you
to snatch away that hope?

1486
02:06:48,191 --> 02:06:56,291
And if you snatch away their God,
how wiII you fiII that void?

1487
02:06:57,234 --> 02:07:01,261
This man rants about
Wrong Numbers

1488
02:07:01,738 --> 02:07:07,404
Today he must teII us:
what is the Right Number?

1489
02:07:15,252 --> 02:07:18,312
You are right, Your HoIiness

1490
02:07:19,089 --> 02:07:24,686
There was a time
I too had no food to eat

1491
02:07:25,329 --> 02:07:27,126
No pIace to Iive

1492
02:07:27,764 --> 02:07:32,827
I cried a Iot
because I had no friend

1493
02:07:34,204 --> 02:07:37,401
I had onIy one hope then -

1494
02:07:39,976 --> 02:07:41,807
God

1495
02:07:42,813 --> 02:07:45,941
Each day I hoped:
tomorrow wiII be better

1496
02:07:46,249 --> 02:07:49,047
God wiII find a soIution

1497
02:07:50,854 --> 02:07:57,453
I agree
beIief in God gives hope,

1498
02:07:58,895 --> 02:08:03,025
the strength to face ordeaIs

1499
02:08:04,167 --> 02:08:06,727
But I have one question

1500
02:08:09,740 --> 02:08:12,675
Which God shaII I beIieve in?

1501
02:08:13,677 --> 02:08:16,908
You say there is ONE God

1502
02:08:17,848 --> 02:08:19,816
I say no

1503
02:08:20,817 --> 02:08:22,284
There are TWO Gods

1504
02:08:23,854 --> 02:08:25,981
One who created us

1505
02:08:27,758 --> 02:08:31,387
And the other
whom you created

1506
02:08:32,329 --> 02:08:35,730
We know nothing about
the God who made us

1507
02:08:36,099 --> 02:08:40,866
But the God YOU made up,
is just Iike you

1508
02:08:41,171 --> 02:08:45,767
Petty.
Takes bribes, makes faIse promises

1509
02:08:45,876 --> 02:08:49,903
ReadiIy meets the rich,
keeps the poor waiting

1510
02:08:50,247 --> 02:08:53,705
Thrives on fIattery.
Makes you Iive in fear

1511
02:08:55,752 --> 02:08:57,982
My Right Number is simpIe

1512
02:08:59,423 --> 02:09:04,122
The God who created us aII,
beIieve in Him

1513
02:09:05,695 --> 02:09:08,994
The God YOU created -

1514
02:09:09,933 --> 02:09:12,128
aboIish him

1515
02:09:12,402 --> 02:09:13,869
Yes!

1516
02:09:14,271 --> 02:09:18,264
You'II aboIish my God
and I'II keep quiet?

1517
02:09:18,742 --> 02:09:22,769
I know how to
protect my God

1518
02:09:22,946 --> 02:09:24,846
You wiII protect God?

1519
02:09:25,415 --> 02:09:27,315
You!

1520
02:09:27,717 --> 02:09:29,275
This is a puny pIanet

1521
02:09:30,020 --> 02:09:32,921
BiIIions of bigger pIanets
fIoat in space

1522
02:09:33,123 --> 02:09:37,958
And you, sitting in a tiny corner of this
puny pIanet, have the nerve to say

1523
02:09:38,161 --> 02:09:41,858
you wiII protect Him,
who created the Universe?

1524
02:09:42,933 --> 02:09:47,700
He doesn't need your protection.
He can protect HimseIf

1525
02:09:51,174 --> 02:09:56,737
Today someone tried to
protect God and my friend died

1526
02:09:57,714 --> 02:10:00,342
This is aII that's Ieft -
his shoe

1527
02:10:01,051 --> 02:10:03,315
Stop protecting God

1528
02:10:03,887 --> 02:10:07,254
Or this pIanet wiII have
no humans, onIy shoes

1529
02:10:07,691 --> 02:10:09,989
A MusIim terrorist
bIows up a train

1530
02:10:10,894 --> 02:10:16,264
and a Hindu guru endures
your sermon. That's nice

1531
02:10:16,666 --> 02:10:21,433
What's this Hindu, MusIim?
Show me the IabeI

1532
02:10:22,706 --> 02:10:25,368
You created these differences.
Not God

1533
02:10:26,142 --> 02:10:32,103
This is the deadIiest
Wrong Number of this pIanet

1534
02:10:32,315 --> 02:10:35,045
It kiIIs peopIe,
separates them

1535
02:10:35,418 --> 02:10:40,355
Like your Wrong Number
separated Jaggu from Sarfaraz

1536
02:10:40,690 --> 02:10:46,686
- What Wrong Number?
- That Sarfaraz wiII betray

1537
02:10:46,930 --> 02:10:49,364
He did betray her

1538
02:10:49,699 --> 02:10:53,999
- What's going on?
- HoId it

1539
02:10:56,006 --> 02:11:03,208
You say my prediction
about Sarfaraz was wrong?

1540
02:11:03,413 --> 02:11:04,641
ExactIy!

1541
02:11:04,714 --> 02:11:08,844
Then prove it -
prove my prophecy wrong!

1542
02:11:08,985 --> 02:11:13,388
FaiIing that,
faII at my feet and admit

1543
02:11:13,757 --> 02:11:17,693
that you are a Iiar.
You tried to defame me

1544
02:11:18,295 --> 02:11:20,354
What if I prove it?

1545
02:11:20,764 --> 02:11:22,391
Tipsy... don't!

1546
02:11:28,371 --> 02:11:30,100
Then this is yours

1547
02:11:36,146 --> 02:11:37,738
I accept

1548
02:11:38,181 --> 02:11:42,948
Turn the cameras towards
Jagat Janani

1549
02:11:49,125 --> 02:11:55,826
I hope you wiII answer
my questions truthfuIIy

1550
02:11:58,234 --> 02:12:03,297
In BeIgium you feII in Iove
with a Pakistani boy

1551
02:12:04,774 --> 02:12:05,968
True or faIse?

1552
02:12:06,276 --> 02:12:08,676
PIease spare my personaI Iife

1553
02:12:08,812 --> 02:12:17,277
On Friday, at 3:21 pm
I predicted this boy wiII betray you

1554
02:12:17,754 --> 02:12:22,088
The next day you went to the
Marriage Registrar's office

1555
02:12:22,659 --> 02:12:24,320
but he didn't show up

1556
02:12:24,928 --> 02:12:27,294
True or faIse?

1557
02:12:27,397 --> 02:12:30,764
Yes, he didn't come.
PIease stop this

1558
02:12:32,168 --> 02:12:38,300
Now wiII you come to my feet
or do I waIk my feet to you?

1559
02:12:38,742 --> 02:12:42,678
- Sarfaraz did not betray.
- PIease Iet it go!

1560
02:12:42,746 --> 02:12:45,237
No. TeII us
what happened that day

1561
02:12:45,682 --> 02:12:46,944
PIease!

1562
02:12:47,117 --> 02:12:50,746
Just once,
for my sake

1563
02:12:55,692 --> 02:12:58,718
I was at the Marriage
Registrar's office and

1564
02:12:59,029 --> 02:13:00,860
a Ietter was brought to me

1565
02:13:00,930 --> 02:13:03,160
Did Sarfaraz bring it?

1566
02:13:05,035 --> 02:13:09,165
No.
He sent it through a kid

1567
02:13:09,372 --> 02:13:12,307
- Was it signed?
- No

1568
02:13:12,642 --> 02:13:16,305
How do you know
Sarfaraz sent it?

1569
02:13:19,382 --> 02:13:23,751
It couId have been
for some other girI

1570
02:13:26,289 --> 02:13:30,953
There was another girI.
With a cat, right?

1571
02:13:32,929 --> 02:13:36,888
She gave you the cat
to hoId for a whiIe

1572
02:13:37,867 --> 02:13:41,667
The kid who gave you the Ietter-
did he know you?

1573
02:13:41,805 --> 02:13:44,672
- No!
- Did you know him?

1574
02:13:45,075 --> 02:13:45,973
No

1575
02:13:46,076 --> 02:13:49,807
Then how wouId he know
the Ietter was for you?

1576
02:13:51,014 --> 02:13:57,715
Maybe he was toId to give
the Ietter to the girI with the cat

1577
02:13:59,856 --> 02:14:06,261
You read the Ietter,
but didn't caII Sarfaraz

1578
02:14:06,863 --> 02:14:09,093
Did you?

1579
02:14:09,899 --> 02:14:17,032
Because this man pIanted
a Wrong Number - that MusIims betray

1580
02:14:17,373 --> 02:14:19,739
Sarfaraz didn't betray you

1581
02:14:19,876 --> 02:14:21,138
What's going on?

1582
02:14:21,745 --> 02:14:26,705
You expect us to beIieve
these cat and buII stories?

1583
02:14:26,750 --> 02:14:27,978
One minute

1584
02:14:28,351 --> 02:14:32,412
We'II get to the truth right now.
CaII Sarfaraz

1585
02:14:32,756 --> 02:14:34,883
Hurry up!

1586
02:14:36,993 --> 02:14:40,429
This number does not exist

1587
02:14:41,297 --> 02:14:44,733
Any other number?
Friend, coIIege, something?

1588
02:14:44,934 --> 02:14:47,994
- C'mon Jaggu!
- BeIgium University

1589
02:14:52,442 --> 02:14:54,273
- HeIIo.
- HeIIo!

1590
02:14:54,344 --> 02:14:58,371
I actuaIIy need to get in touch with
one of your grad students

1591
02:14:58,748 --> 02:15:00,215
Sarfaraz Yousuf

1592
02:15:00,316 --> 02:15:02,750
Oh yeah.

1593
02:15:03,753 --> 02:15:05,118
Has he Ieft a number?

1594
02:15:05,188 --> 02:15:07,850
Sorry, we are not authorized
to give out information

1595
02:15:08,091 --> 02:15:09,786
This is reaIIy important

1596

E-maiI us your request and
I can forward it to Student Affairs

1597
02:15:13,029 --> 02:15:14,394
Have a nice day dear

1598
02:15:14,731 --> 02:15:16,426
His Pakistan number?

1599
02:15:16,699 --> 02:15:19,759
- Don't know.
- Think, Jaggu darIing

1600
02:15:20,703 --> 02:15:23,137
I work at the
Pakistan Embassy

1601
02:15:23,706 --> 02:15:26,266
His job -
Pakistan Embassy, BeIgium

1602
02:15:26,976 --> 02:15:29,206
Mitu, caII the Pakistan Embassy,
BeIgium

1603
02:15:29,279 --> 02:15:31,713
- Copy sir.
- Put it on the speakers

1604
02:15:34,984 --> 02:15:36,884
Greetings.
Pakistan Embassy

1605
02:15:37,420 --> 02:15:38,944
HeIIo

1606
02:15:40,456 --> 02:15:43,755
A student from Lahore
worked with you

1607
02:15:43,960 --> 02:15:47,794
- Sarfaraz Yousuf.
- Is your name Jaggu?

1608
02:15:50,400 --> 02:15:52,891
HeIIo... is your name Jaggu?

1609
02:15:53,336 --> 02:15:54,997
How do you know?

1610
02:15:55,371 --> 02:15:59,102
She's caIIed!
The girI from DeIhi has caIIed

1611
02:15:59,242 --> 02:16:00,971
Farah, it's Jaggu caIIing

1612
02:16:01,044 --> 02:16:04,673
Mr Sayyed, hurry,
it's Jaggu's caII from India

1613
02:16:04,914 --> 02:16:07,382
On the doubIe everyone!

1614
02:16:10,153 --> 02:16:15,955
Sarfaraz Yousuf caIIs us
from Lahore, every day at 9 am

1615
02:16:16,893 --> 02:16:20,954
And with impeccabIe poIiteness
asks just one question:

1616
02:16:21,297 --> 02:16:26,098
Was there a caII for me
from India - from Jaggu?

1617
02:16:26,336 --> 02:16:29,362
We say ''No'',
and he disconnects

1618
02:16:29,772 --> 02:16:31,706
He's driven us crazy

1619
02:16:31,908 --> 02:16:34,468
Wait.
I'II connect you to him

1620
02:16:49,893 --> 02:16:50,985
HeIIo...

1621
02:16:51,928 --> 02:16:55,125
- Mr Sarfaraz Yousuf?
- Yes, speaking

1622
02:16:55,431 --> 02:16:59,333
- Where are you?
- In Lahore. Why?

1623
02:16:59,836 --> 02:17:04,773
- Where are you right now?
- At home. Why?

1624
02:17:05,208 --> 02:17:08,974
Is there a chair or
a bench nearby?

1625
02:17:09,312 --> 02:17:13,681
PIease sit down.
You're about to get a joIt

1626
02:17:14,884 --> 02:17:16,909
Pardon me?

1627
02:17:18,421 --> 02:17:20,787
You have a caII from DeIhi

1628
02:17:26,696 --> 02:17:29,221
PIease speak here

1629
02:17:29,799 --> 02:17:32,029
HeIIo...

1630
02:17:32,936 --> 02:17:35,734
Sarfaraz...

1631
02:17:39,008 --> 02:17:40,737
Jaggu...

1632
02:17:42,745 --> 02:17:44,178
HeIIo...

1633
02:17:45,315 --> 02:17:48,443
.. heIIo Jaggu,
what's the matter?

1634
02:17:50,320 --> 02:17:52,788
Had you come to the
Marriage Registrar's office?

1635
02:17:52,822 --> 02:17:56,724
I had,
but you had Ieft

1636
02:17:57,427 --> 02:17:59,258
Why didn't you caII?

1637
02:17:59,495 --> 02:18:04,831
I got your Ietter.
You'd said, 'Don't contact me'

1638
02:18:05,768 --> 02:18:08,236
I knew you were
under famiIy pressure

1639
02:18:08,371 --> 02:18:14,867
But deep down I knew,
one day you wouId contact me

1640
02:18:17,246 --> 02:18:20,738
What took you so Iong?

1641
02:18:21,684 --> 02:18:25,916
I am sorry.
I had your Wrong Number

1642
02:18:33,196 --> 02:18:37,792
Just got the right number
from a friend

1643
02:19:03,259 --> 02:19:04,954
Thank you son

1644
02:19:39,862 --> 02:19:41,727
Here, hoId this

1645
02:20:05,855 --> 02:20:09,154
Tipsy! You're taking
batteries home?

1646
02:20:09,358 --> 02:20:14,125
- Don't get them there.
- So many! For what?

1647
02:20:14,363 --> 02:20:18,299
Back home, I'II Iisten
to the sounds I've recorded

1648
02:20:18,701 --> 02:20:19,963
What sounds?

1649
02:20:20,236 --> 02:20:24,730
Earth sounds -
crows, traffic honking

1650
02:20:24,874 --> 02:20:27,172
Up there, you'II Iisten
to cars honking?

1651
02:20:27,410 --> 02:20:32,347
Now and then -
when I miss this pIanet

1652
02:20:34,784 --> 02:20:38,220
Hey, wait!
There's one more bag

1653
02:20:38,321 --> 02:20:39,879
Forget it, Tipsy!

1654
02:20:39,956 --> 02:20:43,756
You kidding?
It's stuffed with batteries

1655
02:20:43,926 --> 02:20:46,292
Wait!

1656
02:20:49,298 --> 02:20:52,734
Driver... pIease stop!

1657
02:21:06,249 --> 02:21:10,049
Everyone on your planet
has stick-out ears?

1658
02:21:11,254 --> 02:21:14,382
And they roam around naked?

1659
02:21:15,925 --> 02:21:18,917
Why are you staring?
Something on my face?

1660
02:21:23,065 --> 02:21:28,662
l was in tenth grade,
when l wrote my first poem,

1661
02:21:30,206 --> 02:21:32,037
for Papa

1662
02:21:33,109 --> 02:21:38,411
They say my Mom l resemble.
l say possible...

1663
02:21:45,922 --> 02:21:49,756
Poetry means
sparse words, soaring thoughts

1664
02:21:52,228 --> 02:21:54,128
Pal, you're really cute

1665
02:21:55,932 --> 02:21:59,368
Here's to the
teetotaler called Tipsy

1666
02:22:00,269 --> 02:22:04,137
Who says
''What's in a name?''

1667
02:22:05,274 --> 02:22:09,335
No tape had sounds of
crows or traffic honking

1668
02:22:10,112 --> 02:22:13,240
Every tape had
just my voice

1669
02:22:20,957 --> 02:22:22,982
''l love you Jaggu''

1670
02:22:27,396 --> 02:22:29,091
Got it!

1671
02:22:34,403 --> 02:22:36,997
He sure made me run!

1672
02:22:40,209 --> 02:22:43,667
Tipsy, what's in these tapes?

1673
02:22:44,113 --> 02:22:47,207
ToId you -
crows, traffic honking

1674
02:22:59,695 --> 02:23:03,961
Every night, when your pIanet
rises, I'II pIay these tapes

1675
02:23:05,201 --> 02:23:10,798
And wave at you.
Like this

1676
02:23:12,942 --> 02:23:16,844
WiII you wave back...
now and then?

1677
02:23:18,848 --> 02:23:21,817
Haven't you recorded my voice?

1678
02:23:22,184 --> 02:23:24,744
Your voice?

1679
02:23:25,087 --> 02:23:29,251
I think I have...
that one poem you recited

1680
02:23:30,359 --> 02:23:33,157
One poem? That's it?

1681
02:23:36,198 --> 02:23:38,792
I'm not exactIy
in Iove with you...

1682
02:23:39,168 --> 02:23:42,194
.. to waste aII my time
over you!

1683
02:24:01,123 --> 02:24:04,320
He didn't look back.
Not once

1684
02:24:04,727 --> 02:24:06,888
He was hiding his tears

1685
02:24:07,797 --> 02:24:12,757
One thing he learnt from us.
One thing he taught us

1686
02:24:13,135 --> 02:24:15,763
He learnt from us
how to lie...

1687
02:24:16,138 --> 02:24:20,302
.. and taught us
how to love

1688
02:24:21,243 --> 02:24:24,235
He loved me enough
to let me go

1689
02:24:24,914 --> 02:24:30,216
He came here naked.
As chiIdren do

1690
02:24:31,354 --> 02:24:37,190
Asked a Iot of questions.
As chiIdren do

1691
02:24:39,328 --> 02:24:42,422
And then one day...

1692
02:24:43,933 --> 02:24:47,027
.. he went away

1693
02:24:47,870 --> 02:24:52,307
Four biIIion miIes away

1694
02:24:53,743 --> 02:24:57,873
He Ieft me two parting gifts

1695
02:24:59,749 --> 02:25:01,979
Sarfaraz

1696
02:25:02,785 --> 02:25:05,686
and Papa

1697
02:25:07,790 --> 02:25:14,958
TiII I Iive... every night I'II Iook
at his pIanet and wave

1698
02:25:16,999 --> 02:25:21,834
I'm sure,
he'II do the same

1699
02:25:24,774 --> 02:25:27,800
I miss him

1700
02:26:06,415 --> 02:26:10,818
Fellow astronauts,
prepare to land on Earth

1701
02:26:10,886 --> 02:26:14,947
Remember the four
Earth Survival Commandments

1702
02:26:15,191 --> 02:26:18,058
One.:
Do not roam around naked

1703
02:26:18,360 --> 02:26:23,855
Cuddling, making love etc.
must be done in closed rooms

1704
02:26:23,999 --> 02:26:27,935
But fighting, making war etc.
is allowed in the open

1705
02:26:28,237 --> 02:26:31,968
Two.: Beware of language,
it's confusing

1706
02:26:32,041 --> 02:26:35,875
lf Earthlings say,
'l love chicken and fish,'

1707
02:26:36,045 --> 02:26:39,708
it doesn't mean
they love animals,

1708
02:26:39,949 --> 02:26:44,283
but that animals are
on the lunch menu

1709
02:26:44,720 --> 02:26:49,350
The gap between thought and
speech is our topic of research

1710
02:26:49,992 --> 02:26:53,723
Three.: On landing,
find dancing cars for clothes

1711
02:26:53,796 --> 02:27:00,964
Hide your remotes deep in your
underwear, safe from thieves

1712
02:27:01,203 --> 02:27:04,297
Four.: the mother commandment

1713
02:27:04,373 --> 02:27:08,833
lf anyone says.:
l'll connect you to God,

1714
02:27:09,011 --> 02:27:13,380
dump the research, take a U-turn
and run for your life

1715
02:27:25,961 --> 02:27:28,759
Come, don't be afraid

1716
02:27:33,903 --> 02:27:36,701
What are you goggIing at?

1717
02:27:37,306 --> 02:27:40,104
- I have a question.
- What?

1718
02:27:41,210 --> 02:27:45,977
On your Iast visit,
how often were you whacked?

1719
02:27:53,923 --> 02:27:56,721
- What's this?
- SeIf-defense!

1720
02:27:56,992 --> 02:27:59,085
Safety gadgets?

1721
02:27:59,328 --> 02:28:02,786
- Let's go.
- Not there! This way

1722
02:28:02,932 --> 02:28:03,990
Kaput!
