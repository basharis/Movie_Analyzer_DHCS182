Arkhip, give me the belt.

00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:12,696
There you go.

25
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,936
Bring it up!

26
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:56,848
Oh God, I pray we make it.

27
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,336
Hurry up, untie it!

28
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:20,248
- Arkhip! Hold on a minute!
- Hurry, Yefim!

29
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:35,929
I'm here... here...

30
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,936
Wait...

31
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:47,530
Cut the rope, uncle!

32
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,256
Stick the brand into his mug!

33
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,332
I'm flying!

34
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:14,770
Yefim! What are you doing?

35
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:23,938
I'm flying!

36
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:28,538
Arkhip, I'm flying!

37
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:47,768
Hey, you! Catch me!

38
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,172
Oh, my God! What is it?!

39
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:46,335
Arkhipushka!!

40
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:20,175
BUFFOON

41
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:26,170
Moscow is full of painters
even without us.

42
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:29,338
Don't worry, we'll find some job.

43
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,775
Sure. But it's still annoying that...

44
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:36,178
Yes. Take this birch-tree. Every day
you walked by, without noticing it.

45
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:38,848
But when you know
that you won't see it again...

46
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:41,016
Look at it, it's so beautiful!

47
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:44,098
- Sure thing, ten years.
- Nine.

48
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:47,929
- It's 9 for you, for me it's 10.
- No. For me it's 7, for you, 9.

49
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:50,536
Rain! Let's take cover here!

50
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:52,776
Come on! It's no big deal.

51
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:29,178
There went a buffoon breed,

52
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:32,335
They indulged in honey and mead.

53
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:35,538
They met a high-ranked boyar,
They met a one-eyed Tartar.

54
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:37,856
They amused him all along,
They honored him with a song.

55
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:43,339
Our boyar is a lucky devil,
His is a house of plentiful level.

56
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:46,936
His wife has a gorgeous body,

57
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:50,257
She may show it,
but not to everybody.

58
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:55,255
Good woman, open the door,
Your master is coming.

59
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:58,016
And the boyar, what a spunk!
Tried to make them funk.

60
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:00,939
All of you, buffoons,
Are drunks and thieves,

61
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:04,936
You're flogged and will be
's long as anybody breathes.

62
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:08,928
You vagabonding slime,
You'll die in your grime.

63
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:11,938
Soon all of your make
Will be burnt on the stake.

64
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:13,778
Rap! And he was grabbed

65
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:17,529
Somewhere between
his knee and his spleen.

66
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:20,696
The boyar used to have a beard.

67
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:24,609
Promptly, with a grin,
They shaved him clean.

68
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,333
And missing one's beard is wrong,

69
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,935
Because even women have beards
Where they belong.

70
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:32,849
The boyar whimpers and howls,
Hopping like a flea on the balls.

71
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:36,097
Even a goat has a beard.
I better go home to my endeared.

72
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,097
So he knocked on his window. Oh?

73
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:43,176
His wife would not recognize him, no.

74
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,689
She saw a face, bald and bare,

75
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:49,698
And failed to grab him by his hair.

76
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,855
She socked it to him with a pan. Bang!

77
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:57,015
So that he behaved, and not raved.

78
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:01,929
Shame and disgrace!
Better put pants on your face.

79
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:05,177
Look! Isn't it weird?
A boyar without his beard!

80
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:09,531
The boyar took to running and roaming,
After him the geese were swarming.

81
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:13,528
He ran with no luck,
Lame like a duck.

82
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,935
A priest on the road
Took him for a broad.

83
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:19,098
The priest, a horny stag,
Him to the bushes he dragged.

84
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,696
If you strip him of his pants

85
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:27,178
And look at his both ends,
There's no difference!

86
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,095
Which one is my mazard?

87
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:12,779
It's raining outside.
Can we wait here?

88
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:15,337
Come on in.

89
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:23,936
Want some mead?
You're dripping wet.

90
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:28,019
- Thank you. We don't drink.
- Nor of women we ever think.

91
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:14,777
A priest is God's doing,
a buffoon is the devil's.

92
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:52,936
What if my old woman goes
to the bushes, too?

93
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:56,538
Yours will be the first to go there.

94
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:14,769
Yours will be the first to go, anyway.

95
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,097
Come here!

96
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:34,248
- Where have you been?
- Just took a little walk.

97
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,416
Shall we go?

98
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:49,019
Hey, Danila!
The rain's over. Let's go.

99
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:20,254
Christ be with you, good woman.

100
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:06,132
THEOPHANES THE GREEK

101
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:13,019
Have mercy!
I'm innocent!

102
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:15,176
Maybe he IS innocent?

103
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:17,610
They've slandered me, vipers!

104
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:54,096
Anyone here?

105
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:30,850
- Did you come to have a look?
- Yes, to have a look.

106
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:41,255
Go ahead, look.
Before we put drying oil on.

107
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:47,771
So you're the Greek, Theophanes?

108
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:53,100
Yes. What are you looking at me for?
Look over there.

109
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:57,016
Where are you from?

110
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:59,609
From the Andronnikov Monastery.

111
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:03,176
Then you must be Andrei Rublyov.

112
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,093
No.

113
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:11,779
I hear everybody praising Rublyov
at the top of their voices.

114
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,336
Well, he's a good master.

115
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:18,095
But he'll never be able to do this.

116
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:23,619
It's amazing, with the colors being
so quiet.

117
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:30,334
Oh, God!
It's just...

118
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:36,336
Why did you stop praising?
Speak out.

119
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:39,617
I can't.
I can't even put it in words.

120
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:43,338
There's a great truth
in Konstantin Kostechensky's saying:

121
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:46,538
"You'll penetrate the crux of every
thing

122
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:49,698
if you describe it truthfully."

123
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:55,336
And Andrei...
Well, I'm ready to say it to his face.

124
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,776
He's like brother to me.

125
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:01,175
They praise him, that's right.

126
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:06,852
He puts the paint in a thin layer,
very delicately, very skillfully.

127
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:12,017
But something is missing...

128
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:19,690
Fear is missing, and faith!

129
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:23,618
The faith that comes from the bottom
of one's heart.

130
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,856
And simplicity.

131
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:29,609
Remember what Epiphanius said

132
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:32,937
about Sergius's virtue:

133
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:35,935
"Simplicity without flourish".

134
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:41,097
That's what it is.
It's holy.

135
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:44,095
Simplicity without flourish.

136
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:46,696
You couldn't put it better.

137
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:49,255
I see you're clever!

138
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:51,416
But what good is there in it?

139
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:53,935
Maybe it's better, in the darkness
of your ignorance,

140
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:56,700
to follow your heart's calling?

141
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:00,529
Too much wisdom
brings much sorrow.

142
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:04,335
He that increaseth knowledge
increaseth sorrow.

143
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:16,012
Proshka! Where's the drying oil?
Whose ears I'll have to box?

144
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:19,256
Where have they all gone?

145
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:21,416
They say you finish your paintings
very quickly.

146
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:24,618
That's the only way I can paint.
I get bored very soon.

147
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:27,937
Once I puttered over it for a whole
week and finally had to give it up!

148
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,539
And you threw it away?

149
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:33,096
Why?
Used it to press sauerkraut.

150
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:35,689
I'm fed up with it up to here!

151
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:40,018
I've got apprentices galore,
and not one of them is any good.

152
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:42,609
They can't even read manuscripts.

153
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:48,175
Listen, will you be my assistant?

154
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:51,936
Stop joking. Don't laugh at me.

155
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:54,096
I'm not joking.

156
00:22:54,300 --> 00:23:00,170
I have no one to help me decorate
the Annunciation Cathedral in Moscow.

157
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:03,338
The scaffolding's been already
erected there. Do you understand?

158
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:06,538
I understand, but I think I'm not up
to the job.

159
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:11,177
I'll explain everything to you. Have
you ever painted on raw gesso ground?

160
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:13,336
Sure, with brains like yours!

161
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:16,174
Even these fools of mine
can work the brush.

162
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:19,618
I said no.
Let's not talk about it any more.

163
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:21,776
Well, as you wish...

164
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:26,929
But don't regret it later.
I don't forget easily!

165
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:29,938
I may regret,
but you're doing a wrong thing.

166
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:32,938
A poor monk came to you,

167
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:35,938
and you liked talking with him
about books.

168
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:38,938
So you decided
to do him a great favor.

169
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:42,098
As a matter of fact, I haven't
touched a book for three years.

170
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:46,930
And I don't want to.
My path is different now.

171
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:53,937
- I'm going to die soon.
- Come on, don't say that.

172
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:58,531
Yes, I'm going to die. The other day,
I saw an angel in my dream.

173
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:01,174
"Come with me," he says.

174
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:05,532
And I answer: "I'm going to die soon
anyway, without your help."

175
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:20,696
Won't you change your mind?

176
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:27,771
All right. But on one condition.

177
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:30,938
What do you want? Money?
We'll split it in half. Is it a deal?

178
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:33,096
No. I'll be working for free.

179
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:39,933
But only if you yourself come for me
to the monastery

180
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:44,177
and in front of the whole community
and our bishop

181
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:46,689
ask me to come and help you.

182
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:51,016
With all our brethren present,
and Andrei Rublyov, too.

183
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:55,937
Then I'll be like your slave,
I'll serve you like a dog

184
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:58,529
until I die.

185
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:02,779
- And what is your name?
- Kirill.

186
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:14,689
The Orthodox people!
Truth-seekers and Christians!

187
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:17,698
For how long are you going to torture
the villain?

188
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,856
Will there be an end to it?

189
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:24,099
You're all great sinners yourselves,
but you take it upon you to judge!

190
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:26,530
Don't you have any fear of God?

191
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:48,168
The Prince commands you
to come to Moscow.

192
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:51,258
To decorate the Annunciation Cathedral,

193
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:53,690
together with Theophanes the Greek.

194
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:02,339
Is he really Andrei Rublyov?

195
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:09,609
That's true. He is Andrei Rublyov.
And I'm Kirill.

196
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:14,336
Theophanes the Greek tells you
to come to Moscow.

197
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,935
He wants to see you.

198
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:19,529
I thank Theophanes, too.

199
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:22,093
Tell him...

200
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:29,338
that... well... I'll come.

201
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:34,336
My head is splitting!

202
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:39,936
Bring it here.

203
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:46,538
You may take with you
whatever assistants you want.

204
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:49,698
Tomorrow you'll have to be in Moscow.

205
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:52,858
Is there a smithy nearby?
I'm afraid I'll fall down again.

206
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:56,336
There's a chapel outside the gates.
Next will be the smithy.

207
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:58,935
Farewell, God's people!

208
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:08,531
We could go today, Danila.
What do you think?

209
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:12,018
Let's get our things and set out.

210
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:15,174
Before Theophanes may change his mind.

211
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:19,771
- I'm not going.
- What do you mean?

212
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:26,851
- What am I to do without you?
- Do as you like.

213
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,609
I thought we'd go together.

214
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:37,018
Why were you thinking for me?
I was not invited.

215
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:44,095
I can't go without you.

216
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:49,532
You can!
You said 'yes' without asking me.

217
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:53,528
You were too quick to agree.
Theophanes had only to beckon.

218
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:56,938
Never mind, though.

219
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:59,779
You're not the first
and you won't be the last.

220
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:03,253
I've got a lot of work here
even without you.

221
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:12,616
Very well, then!

222
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:16,618
Foma! Alexei! Come on!

223
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:20,531
Pyotr! Get ready!
You're going with me.

224
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:38,336
Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth;

225
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:42,334
and let thy heart cheer thee
in the days of thy youth.

226
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:47,539
And walk in the ways of thine heart,
and in the sight of thine eyes.

227
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:50,334
But know though, that for all these
things

228
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:53,538
God will bring thee into judgement.

229
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:07,530
Remember now thy Creator
in the days of thy youth,

230
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:10,698
while the evil days come not,
nor the years draw nigh,

231
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,856
when thou shalt say,

232
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:15,528
I have no pleasure in them.

233
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:18,859
Or ever the silver cord
be loosed,

234
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:21,176
or the golden bowl be broken,

235
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:23,530
or the pitcher be broken
at the fountain,

236
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:26,538
or the wheel be broken
at the cistern.

237
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:30,530
Then shall the dust return
to the earth as it was:

238
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:34,335
and the spirit shall return unto God
who gave it.

239
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:38,937
Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher;
All is vanity.

240
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:45,336
Kirill!
Have you seen Father Nikodim?

241
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:51,178
Where could he go so early
in the morning?

242
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:56,335
He took my mittens
and vanished into thin air.

243
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:01,929
I have to sort out firewood,
and the logs are ice-cold.

244
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:09,336
Why do you keep the torch on?
It's morning already.

245
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:13,935
Did you feed my dog?

246
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,856
You didn't ask me to, did you?

247
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:24,336
What's the matter?

248
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:33,333
Go...

249
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:03,616
Have you forgotten something?

250
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:07,696
I came to say goodbye.

251
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:11,416
You already did.

252
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:25,928
I came to say goodbye, but...

253
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:33,779
I was feeling pretty bad as it was.

254
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:38,931
And to make it worse, the devil has
brought about this enmity between us.

255
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:45,780
I can't leave like that.
I need to confess.

256
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:50,333
Will you hear it out?

257
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:01,697
I won't be able to do anything,
Danila.

258
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:07,018
We've lived in the same cell
for years.

259
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:14,531
I have nobody but you.

260
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:20,770
I see the world with your eyes.

261
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:24,616
I listen with your ears.

262
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:28,616
With your heart...

263
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:40,929
I'm happy for you,
you silly man.

264
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:43,530
You can't imagine how glad I am.

265
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:48,931
Go to Moscow, paint,
and I'll be proud of you.

266
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:51,848
The devil tripped me up yesterday
also.

267
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:54,536
Forgive me, too.

268
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:21,540
I'll be back, Danila.

269
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:37,532
Where are you going?
What about the vespers?

270
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:40,698
You'll serve it without me,
and I'll do without you.

271
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:43,095
What's the matter with you, Kirill?

272
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:47,088
I'm tired of it. Tired of lying!
I'm going in the world.

273
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:53,768
Why did we leave the Trinity?

274
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:56,540
Why don't you say it?

275
00:33:56,740 --> 00:34:01,097
Because our brothers put their
interests above faith.

276
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:06,328
And here again? We thought we'd
be serving God by our faith and work,

277
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:08,696
and what have we got?

278
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:11,016
Our monastery looks like
a market place.

279
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:15,611
You, God's servant, how much did you
pay to be ordained? Twenty souls?

280
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:19,608
And you kept following the prior,
bargaining with him.

281
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:22,539
For two or, luckily,
for one water meadow,

282
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:25,334
you wanted to win eternal bliss
for yourself.

283
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:28,538
You all know it,
but you won't say anything!

284
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:30,776
You're pretending
you don't notice anything!

285
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:34,177
I might have kept silent, too,
and put up with all this abomination,

286
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:37,338
if I had any talent,

287
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:40,253
or at least some ability
to paint icons.

288
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:43,258
But God didn't give me talent,
and thank God!

289
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:45,416
I'm happy that I got no talent,

290
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:49,175
for because of that I'm honest
and pure before God!

291
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:53,538
And one more thing, brethren...

292
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:58,336
What can you tell us
that we don't know?

293
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:03,176
But do you know
what happens to ones like you?

294
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:04,779
I'm just...

295
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:09,849
Get out of here,
you viper's breed!

296
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:12,335
You'll thrive in the world!
Blasphemer!

297
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:14,332
You see...

298
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,936
Listen, Kirill...

299
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:38,770
It is written:
And Jesus went into the temple of God

300
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:42,336
and cast out all them that sold and
bought in the temple, and overthrew

301
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:47,017
the tables of the moneychangers
and the seats of them that sold doves.

302
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:49,697
And said unto them:

303
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:53,176
My house shall be called
the house of prayer,

304
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:58,170
but ye have made it
a den of thieves.

305
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:30,372
THE ANDREI PASSION

306
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:36,936
I washed Danila's brushes for 3 years
before he trusted me with an icon.

307
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:40,337
And not to correct it,
but just to clean it.

308
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:42,332
Do you trust me?

309
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:44,696
But you're lying all the time!

310
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:48,529
The other night you came back
with your cassock all glued together.

311
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:51,174
- Where had you been?
- At the apiary.

312
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:53,530
And you said you went to
the Andronnikov monastery.

313
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:56,334
Look at yourself!

314
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:04,017
Apply some damp dirt to it,
or you'll be bloated like a hog.

315
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:07,178
It must be too late already.
It won't help.

316
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:12,335
You're making up things on and on.

317
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:17,098
I even thought
you might have some disease.

318
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:19,256
What disease?

319
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:23,089
There must be such a disease

320
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:27,532
when a man can't stop lying.

321
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:40,335
Look, Foma! Look, I say!

322
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:46,338
- Look where?
- Never mind, blockhead.

323
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:51,698
I can't understand why I took you
to be my assistant.

324
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:54,858
You say one thing one day and another
the next. Didn't you tell Theophanes:

325
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:58,416
"This boy never misses a thing
and he likes the azure"?

326
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:02,539
You were a different person then.
You tried hard, you never lied.

327
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:09,338
You know what Theophanes said
about your azure?

328
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:11,696
"What good is in it, in the azure?"

329
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:16,936
And you love to eat.

330
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:20,098
It beats me how you can paint
after that?

331
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:23,531
Can you think of anything else
when your belly growls?

332
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:26,174
All you can hear is that growling.

333
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:30,339
You're a lucky man, Foma.
Everything's plain and simple for you.

334
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:35,929
Only through a prayer
our soul can discern what's invisible.

335
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:46,013
Look! What's that?

336
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:13,177
So, you decided to leave the apostles
on the left?

337
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:19,529
Foma, have you removed the glue
from the fire?

338
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:22,174
Have you removed the glue?

339
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:31,773
He likes the azure!

340
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:35,529
He should be beaten the crap out of
every Saturday!

341
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:13,618
Where did you see all this,

342
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:17,779
when everybody only think
of saving their asses?

343
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:22,531
Even those women of Moscow gave their
hair to the Tartars as a ransom.

344
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:28,531
They preferred to go bald
rather than be tortured.

345
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:30,332
What has unselfishness to do with it?

346
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:32,332
It's not right to say that.

347
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:37,779
It has always been that women
in Russia were oppressed and unhappy.

348
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:40,332
Anyway, it's not what I mean...

349
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:45,256
All right, tell me in all honesty,
are our people ignorant or not?

350
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:47,608
I can't hear you!

351
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:50,334
Yes, ignorant!
But who's to blame for that?

352
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:53,174
Their stupidity is to blame!

353
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:55,940
Have you never sinned
because you're ignorant?

354
00:40:56,460 --> 00:41:00,692
Yes, and I have, too. O God, forgive,
reconcile and curb our passions!

355
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:06,700
The Day of Judgement is coming.
We'll all burn like candles.

356
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:10,938
Mind my word,
it will be hell!

357
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:14,098
People will lump the blame
for their sins on one another,

358
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:16,256
will be justifying themselves
before the Almighty.

359
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:20,089
I don't understand how you can paint,
having thoughts like that.

360
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:22,336
You even accept praise.

361
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:27,691
I'd have taken vows of schema long ago
and settled down in a cave for good.

362
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:30,016
I serve God, not people.

363
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:34,939
Today they praise, tomorrow they'll
abuse what they praised only yesterday,

364
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:39,770
and after that they'll forget both
you and me. They'll forget everything!

365
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:42,540
All is vanity! All is useless!

366
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:49,772
The human race had already
perpetrated all stupidities and wrongs,

367
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:52,175
and now it's just repeating them.

368
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:56,339
Everything falls back into place
again, and goes round and round...

369
00:41:56,980 --> 00:42:01,337
If Jesus came back to Earth again,
He would be once more crucified!

370
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:03,696
If you remember only evil,

371
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:07,336
you can never be happy
before God.

372
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:08,615
What?

373
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:11,937
Maybe some things should be
forgotten, but not every thing.

374
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:15,539
I don't know how to say it...

375
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:19,938
If you don't know, then be silent!
Listen to me!

376
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:25,336
You think that good can be done
only single-handedly?

377
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:30,096
Good!
Have you forgotten the New Testament?

378
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:34,339
Jesus gathered people in the temples,
too. He taught them.

379
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:38,937
And then they gathered together
in order to execute Him.

380
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:41,779
"Crucify him!" they shouted.

381
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:47,530
And His disciples? Judas
betrayed Him, Peter renounced Him.

382
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:51,335
They all abandoned Him!
And they were the best!

383
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:53,536
But they repented!

384
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:58,336
That was much later, don't you
understand? When it was too late.

385
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:04,009
It's true, people do evil, too.
And it's very sad.

386
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:09,088
Judas had sold Christ out.
But do you remember who bought Him?

387
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:10,779
The people.

388
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:14,014
The Pharisees and their scribes.

389
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:17,178
They couldn't find any witness,
however hard they might have tried.

390
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:20,539
Who would slander Him, the innocent?

391
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:24,938
And the Pharisees were great
deceivers, literate and cunning.

392
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:28,176
They even learned to read and write

393
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:31,338
in order to gain power,
taking advantage of His ignorance.

394
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:36,255
People ought to be reminded more
often that they're human beings,

395
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:39,850
that all Russians
are of one blood and of one land!

396
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:43,336
Evil can be found anywhere.

397
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:47,858
There will always be those ready
to sell you for 30 pieces of silver.

398
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:52,335
And the Russian man
gets more and more misfortunes.

399
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:56,539
The Tartars raid him thrice a season,
then comes a famine or a plague.

400
00:43:56,740 --> 00:43:59,095
But he keeps working and working,

401
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:02,531
bearing his cross with humility.

402
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:06,096
Never despairing, but enduring it
silently.

403
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:09,937
And only praying to God
to give him enough strength to endure.

404
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:14,689
Can the Almighty not forgive
such men their ignorance?

405
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:19,859
You know it yourself
that whenever something goes wrong,

406
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:24,690
or you're exhausted and despairing,
and suddenly...

407
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:28,176
you meet some human eyes
and it works

408
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:32,539
as if you took a Communion, and
the weight is lifted from your heart.

409
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:35,096
Isn't it so?

410
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:39,530
You were talking about Jesus.

411
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:43,178
Perhaps He was born and crucified
for only one reason:

412
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:45,530
to reconcile God with man.

413
00:44:46,580 --> 00:44:49,538
Jesus comes from God,
it means He's Almighty.

414
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:54,532
And His dying on the cross
must have been preordained.

415
00:44:55,580 --> 00:44:58,856
His crucifixion and death
were God's doing.

416
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:02,530
And it was supposed to provoke hatred
not of those who crucified Him,

417
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:07,256
but of those who loved Him, if they
had been with Him at that moment.

418
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:11,253
For they loved Him as a man.

419
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:15,258
But He abandoned them
of His own free will,

420
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:19,339
having shown injustice,
or even cruelty.

421
00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:17,896
Do you realize what you're saying?

422
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:24,335
For these words, you'll be packed off
to the North to fix up icons.

423
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:26,172
Am I not right?

424
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:29,531
You always say
what you think yourself.

425
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:34,336
With me, it's different.
I'm a worldly man, a free man.

426
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:48,539
FEAST

427
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:05,256
Sergey, come here!

428
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:08,258
Coming!
Start the fire in the meantime!

429
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:11,338
Foma, let's go fetch some firewood.

430
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:17,936
Peter have seen

431
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:21,177
neither the Assumption,
nor the Dmitrievsky Cathedral.

432
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:23,336
Never mind. After he has roamed
the woods,

433
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:26,538
sweeping his brush,
he'll see what's right.

434
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:36,330
We won't be able to finish painting
the cathedral before the cold spell.

435
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:38,536
It will be June soon.

436
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:49,856
What is it?

437
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:53,939
Wait. Do you hear it?

438
00:48:56,140 --> 00:48:59,530
- A nightingale.
- Nothing else?

439
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:06,254
Can you see it?

440
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:10,938
- What is it?
- Let's go! Come on!

441
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:28,098
Doing witchery.

442
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:35,530
Andrei! Where are you going?

443
00:50:32,620 --> 00:50:35,532
- Come here...
- Wait...

444
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:49,859
I saw you, black vermin, lurking
there.

445
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:53,336
You, God's servants, need to know
everything.

446
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:56,333
Let me go!

447
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:58,775
We'll let you go first thing
in the morning.

448
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:02,939
With a stone on your neck, for you
to swim faster to your destination.

449
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:07,538
A fire will fall down from heavens
and will scorch you all!

450
00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:09,935
The Day of Judgement will come
at last!

451
00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:14,099
We'll fix you
right to this crosspiece.

452
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:17,336
Just like Jesus Christ.

453
00:52:17,820 --> 00:52:20,539
What are you doing, men?

454
00:52:20,740 --> 00:52:25,768
You can't do it to me, men!
Don't you understand? It's a sin!

455
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:30,690
At least tie me with my feet up.
Please, brothers!

456
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:36,098
Let him hang.

457
00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:40,097
Let him spend the night like that,
unless he ascends.

458
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:43,416
He will be here alright.

459
00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:02,779
Why did you ask to hang you
head down?

460
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:05,696
You'd have been even worse off.

461
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:11,175
And why did you curse us?
Threatening us with a fire?

462
00:53:11,380 --> 00:53:15,851
Because it's a sin to run about naked
and do things like that.

463
00:53:17,380 --> 00:53:21,692
This is the night
when everyone should love.

464
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:23,856
Is loving a sin?

465
00:53:24,060 --> 00:53:26,335
You call it love tying a man up
like that?

466
00:53:26,580 --> 00:53:30,016
It's just in case you decided
to bring guards or monks here.

467
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:33,178
To convert us to your faith
by force.

468
00:53:33,740 --> 00:53:36,698
You think it's easy to live in fear,
like we do?

469
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:40,097
You fear because
you either don't love at all,

470
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:43,929
or love shamelessly, bestially,
not with your heart.

471
00:53:44,140 --> 00:53:46,176
Love should be brotherly.

472
00:53:46,380 --> 00:53:49,338
Does it make any difference?
It's still love.

473
00:54:06,580 --> 00:54:08,536
Go on, untie me.

474
00:57:41,140 --> 00:57:42,778
Where've you been?

475
00:57:53,580 --> 00:57:55,252
Where were you?

476
00:57:58,740 --> 00:58:03,177
The woods're all but impassable here.
I've got all scratched up.

477
00:58:04,660 --> 00:58:07,618
But the locals even like it,
they got used to it.

478
00:58:07,820 --> 00:58:10,778
People do everything out of habit.

479
00:58:11,820 --> 00:58:14,778
I guess, old people don't have
to think about anything.

480
00:58:14,980 --> 00:58:17,938
Each day for them rolls by itself.

481
00:58:18,740 --> 00:58:22,335
Or maybe, it's even very comforting
for them:

482
00:58:22,580 --> 00:58:25,538
it drags on and on from morn till
night, with no end.

483
00:58:42,380 --> 00:58:45,099
Just look at yourself!

484
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:48,529
All scratched and black and blue.

485
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:51,689
Aren't you ashamed to appear like
that before your pupils?

486
00:58:54,580 --> 00:58:57,697
- Couldn't you come back sooner?
- I couldn't.

487
00:58:58,580 --> 00:59:01,538
Well, it's your sin,
your conscience, and your prayers.

488
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:06,689
Catch her! Grab the woman!

489
00:59:08,580 --> 00:59:11,333
- Catch him!
- Grab her!

490
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:14,936
Run, Martha!

491
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:21,932
What's the matter with you? The three
of you can't manage one filthy man?

492
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:24,938
Why are they doing it? Why?

493
00:59:25,140 --> 00:59:29,531
Because they won't believe in one God.
Damn pagans!

494
00:59:29,740 --> 00:59:35,337
Don't look, Sergey!
You shouldn't look.

495
00:59:35,740 --> 00:59:40,256
We'll go on living as we used to!

496
00:59:59,060 --> 01:00:01,016
Go on, and no tricks.

497
01:00:08,140 --> 01:00:10,608
Help me, Fyodor!

498
01:00:16,300 --> 01:00:18,256
What's the matter with you, men?

499
01:00:18,460 --> 01:00:21,020
Can't you subdue a woman?

500
01:00:22,980 --> 01:00:25,938
Where are you going?
She will drown you in a jiffy!

501
01:00:31,980 --> 01:00:34,335
Martha! Swim faster!

502
01:01:20,460 --> 01:01:24,009
THE LAST JUDGEMENT

503
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:37,937
- Foma!
- What?

504
01:01:38,380 --> 01:01:40,769
May I go and take a swim?

505
01:01:42,380 --> 01:01:45,929
- Forget it!
- I'm too hot!

506
01:01:46,140 --> 01:01:48,096
It's not hot.
Stop lying.

507
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:50,336
Let him go and take a swim.

508
01:01:50,580 --> 01:01:56,337
All he can do is sit in the water.
He's just imagining it's hot.

509
01:01:56,580 --> 01:01:59,697
It's I who said first it's hot,
not Sergey.

510
01:02:00,060 --> 01:02:03,609
Enough! That's it!
You want to swim, go and swim!

511
01:02:03,820 --> 01:02:07,335
Go on!
Why are you sitting? Go!

512
01:02:16,460 --> 01:02:18,928
- Where's Andrei?
- He's out.

513
01:02:20,060 --> 01:02:22,938
Something has happened...
Such a thing...

514
01:02:24,220 --> 01:02:25,938
Well...

515
01:02:26,900 --> 01:02:32,611
I dropped in at our bishop's,
and there was such a commotion!

516
01:02:32,820 --> 01:02:36,938
The bishop, all livid,
was running about in his underwear.

517
01:02:37,140 --> 01:02:40,098
"I can't stand it any longer,"
he says. "That's it!"

518
01:02:40,300 --> 01:02:42,609
He was speaking about you.

519
01:02:42,820 --> 01:02:46,699
"It's been two months since
everything was ready for their work,

520
01:02:46,900 --> 01:02:49,937
and they're not doing anything,
just loitering about.

521
01:02:50,140 --> 01:02:54,531
They'd demanded an exorbitant price,
and they haven't done a thing yet!"

522
01:02:55,660 --> 01:03:00,097
- Did you really ask a lot of money?
- Oh, come on!

523
01:03:00,380 --> 01:03:02,848
"It makes no difference to me,"
he says.

524
01:03:03,060 --> 01:03:06,689
"Whether it is Daniil Chorny or
Andrei Rublyov! I don't care!"

525
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:13,339
"What's going on?" he says.
And he made a face like that.

526
01:03:13,980 --> 01:03:18,019
"What is it?" he says. "What do I
care if it's Rublyov? If it's Andrei?"

527
01:03:20,060 --> 01:03:25,692
"I need the cathedral to be painted
by the fall, and that's it!" he says.

528
01:03:25,900 --> 01:03:29,336
He sent a messenger to the Grand
Prince with a complaint.

529
01:03:29,580 --> 01:03:34,529
Sent a messenger to the Grand.
You mind that.

530
01:03:35,220 --> 01:03:40,010
What? You really... haven't
started yet?

531
01:03:41,980 --> 01:03:45,859
You know...
you better start... or else...

532
01:03:46,580 --> 01:03:49,777
- Where's Andrei?
- He's gone somewhere again.

533
01:03:50,060 --> 01:03:54,338
Can't you do it without him?
Start without him.

534
01:03:57,380 --> 01:03:59,940
What's so funny?
There're so many of you.

535
01:04:00,580 --> 01:04:03,333
If he hasn't decided yet,
there are enough of you!

536
01:04:03,580 --> 01:04:06,333
Two heads are better that one...

537
01:04:07,580 --> 01:04:09,536
Ah, Andrei, Andrei!

538
01:04:09,740 --> 01:04:13,096
You see, a messenger already went
to complain to the Prince.

539
01:04:14,300 --> 01:04:16,256
Just say 'yes' or 'no'?

540
01:04:16,940 --> 01:04:18,339
Yes or no.

541
01:04:18,580 --> 01:04:20,536
Hadn't we decided all in Moscow?

542
01:04:20,740 --> 01:04:23,937
We'd agreed on everything
up to the last detail.

543
01:04:24,140 --> 01:04:26,335
The Grand Prince himself
had approved it.

544
01:04:27,660 --> 01:04:29,935
What is still unclear to you then?

545
01:04:30,140 --> 01:04:33,530
What have we been shouting ourselves
hoarse about for two months?

546
01:04:34,300 --> 01:04:37,770
Maybe I'm too old,
maybe I'm out of my mind?

547
01:04:40,300 --> 01:04:43,019
"The Last Judgement".
Just go ahead and paint it.

548
01:04:43,660 --> 01:04:46,015
Or maybe we better turn down
this work?

549
01:04:46,220 --> 01:04:49,690
Really, let's turn it down.

550
01:04:49,900 --> 01:04:53,529
And how am I going to look people
in the eyes? I'll burn with shame.

551
01:04:55,900 --> 01:04:58,858
We're losing precious time!
The weather is warm and dry.

552
01:04:59,900 --> 01:05:03,256
We could've already finished the domed
ceiling. And the pillars, too.

553
01:05:04,460 --> 01:05:08,419
And we could've made them
so beautiful and vivid!

554
01:05:09,380 --> 01:05:14,170
We could depict the sinners
boiling in tar in such a way that...

555
01:05:14,380 --> 01:05:16,336
it would make one's flesh creep.

556
01:05:17,740 --> 01:05:21,858
I know how to paint the devil, with
smoke from his nose and eyes like...

557
01:05:22,060 --> 01:05:24,255
Smoke is not the point!

558
01:05:24,460 --> 01:05:26,769
- What is the point then?
- I don't know!

559
01:05:26,980 --> 01:05:29,858
- Why won't you look me in the eye?
- I can't!

560
01:05:45,220 --> 01:05:49,259
I can't paint this.
It's against me. Can't you understand?

561
01:05:51,580 --> 01:05:55,539
I don't want to scare people.
Try to understand, Danila.

562
01:05:56,300 --> 01:05:59,258
Come to your senses! It's the Last
Judgement, that's what it is!

563
01:05:59,460 --> 01:06:01,416
It's not my invention.

564
01:06:01,660 --> 01:06:03,537
No, I can't!

565
01:06:03,740 --> 01:06:06,334
Why didn't you say it in Moscow?

566
01:06:06,580 --> 01:06:08,536
We shouldn't have taken it up
in the first place.

567
01:06:10,140 --> 01:06:11,858
It's so impure!

568
01:06:12,060 --> 01:06:15,689
That's how I am! You seem to have
failed to cultivate purity in me.

569
01:06:16,820 --> 01:06:21,530
I'm leaving you.
This kind of work is not for me.

570
01:06:21,900 --> 01:06:27,020
Thank you for everything,
for the clips on my nose.

571
01:06:27,220 --> 01:06:31,259
You've taught me something, that's
enough. I'm going to work.

572
01:06:34,140 --> 01:06:37,098
They invited me to decorate a chapel
in Pafnutiev.

573
01:06:37,900 --> 01:06:40,095
It's not a big deal,
but at least it's something.

574
01:06:41,740 --> 01:06:43,935
I'm going to paint
"The Last Judgement".

575
01:06:46,460 --> 01:06:48,018
Anyone going with me?

576
01:06:51,580 --> 01:06:56,096
All right, stay.
But be sure not to regret it later!

577
01:07:38,460 --> 01:07:41,611
Though I speak with the tongues
of men and of angels,

578
01:07:41,820 --> 01:07:46,530
but have not love,
I have become sounding brass.

579
01:07:46,740 --> 01:07:48,696
And though I have the gift of prophesy,

580
01:07:48,900 --> 01:07:52,336
and understand... all knowledge,
and though I have all faith,

581
01:07:52,580 --> 01:07:54,935
so that I could remove mountains,

582
01:07:55,140 --> 01:07:58,610
but have not love, I am nothing.

583
01:07:58,820 --> 01:08:02,176
And though I bestow all my goods... and
though I give my body to be burned,

584
01:08:04,380 --> 01:08:06,530
but have not love,

585
01:08:07,220 --> 01:08:10,178
it profits me nothing!

586
01:08:10,380 --> 01:08:13,178
Love suffers long,
and is kind;

587
01:08:13,380 --> 01:08:16,338
love envies not;
love does not parade itself,

588
01:08:16,980 --> 01:08:19,938
is not puffed up,
dos not behave itself unseemly,

589
01:08:20,140 --> 01:08:23,177
seeks not her own, is not easily
provoked, thinks no evil;

590
01:08:25,580 --> 01:08:27,252
does not rejoice in iniquity,

591
01:08:27,460 --> 01:08:29,530
but rejoices in the truth;

592
01:08:29,740 --> 01:08:34,530
bears all things, believes all things,
hopes all things, endures all things.

593
01:08:36,660 --> 01:08:38,776
Love never fails...

594
01:08:41,060 --> 01:08:44,018
But whether there be prophesies,
they shall fail;

595
01:08:44,220 --> 01:08:48,008
whether there be tongues, they'll cease;
...knowledge, it shall vanish away.

596
01:08:49,060 --> 01:08:51,699
For we know in part...

597
01:08:53,220 --> 01:08:56,337
Well, Princess, is it any good?

598
01:08:57,580 --> 01:09:02,335
To splash milk around is sinful.
It's naughty.

599
01:09:05,660 --> 01:09:07,616
Why is it sinful?

600
01:09:07,820 --> 01:09:10,334
Just because.
Go on, wipe me up.

601
01:09:10,580 --> 01:09:12,536
It'll dry up by itself.

602
01:09:14,060 --> 01:09:16,620
Let's go with me for a walk
by the river.

603
01:09:17,740 --> 01:09:23,337
Let go of me, Stepan! Let go,
or I'll send you to the stable!

604
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:30,014
What do you think? Do you like it?

605
01:09:30,740 --> 01:09:35,609
For me, it couldn't be better.
It's so light and beautiful.

606
01:09:43,580 --> 01:09:45,332
Light...

607
01:09:46,740 --> 01:09:50,938
Come on, take her away from here.
The nurses have spoiled her rotten.

608
01:09:51,140 --> 01:09:55,531
Don't worry, no one could've built
you a mansion like we have.

609
01:09:55,740 --> 01:09:58,698
Who could decorate it so beautifully?
And the carving?

610
01:09:58,900 --> 01:10:03,018
Only Mityai can do it.
He carves without marking.

611
01:10:03,220 --> 01:10:05,336
Just like a bird singing.
Look at it!

612
01:10:06,580 --> 01:10:08,536
Maybe it's like a bird, but...

613
01:10:10,300 --> 01:10:13,929
For me it's all right to sleep in
a barn, but you're a Grand Prince.

614
01:10:14,140 --> 01:10:15,937
What? Don't you like it?

615
01:10:16,140 --> 01:10:19,928
Everything has to be repainted.
The walls and the ceiling.

616
01:10:20,140 --> 01:10:22,096
To make it brighter and more vivid.

617
01:10:23,820 --> 01:10:25,936
I've been in this business forty
years!

618
01:10:26,140 --> 01:10:30,179
What matters is not your skill,
but to be able to glorify the prince.

619
01:10:33,380 --> 01:10:35,940
We're not going to redo anything.

620
01:10:36,220 --> 01:10:39,610
It's time for us to leave.
We've been hired for another job.

621
01:10:39,820 --> 01:10:41,776
They expect us in Zvenigorod.

622
01:10:42,220 --> 01:10:43,539
Where?

623
01:10:43,740 --> 01:10:47,415
At your brother's. The stone's
already been brought up there.

624
01:10:48,220 --> 01:10:51,337
Very good stone.
Whiter than this one.

625
01:10:51,580 --> 01:10:55,858
We agreed on it when your brother
was here at Easter time.

626
01:10:56,300 --> 01:11:01,533
"Do whatever you like," he said.
"I won't spare any money.

627
01:11:01,740 --> 01:11:05,096
Just make me the best mansion."

628
01:11:05,300 --> 01:11:08,531
Well, if it's Zvenigorod,
let it be Zvenigorod!

629
01:11:14,220 --> 01:11:17,337
I looked at the prince,
he just stood still.

630
01:11:17,580 --> 01:11:19,935
When I told him about Zvenigorod?

631
01:11:20,140 --> 01:11:22,256
He was just horror-stricken.

632
01:11:22,460 --> 01:11:25,611
He's afraid that his brother
will go one up on him.

633
01:11:27,060 --> 01:11:30,336
- And who carved this?
- I did.

634
01:11:32,220 --> 01:11:34,176
Why didn't you fix it into the wall?

635
01:11:34,380 --> 01:11:36,336
It didn't work.

636
01:11:36,580 --> 01:11:40,539
- A fine beast.
- It crumbled all the way.

637
01:11:42,220 --> 01:11:45,337
I'd warned the prince
not to scrimp on the stone.

638
01:11:45,580 --> 01:11:50,608
He must be regretting it now
that he knows about Zvenigorod.

639
01:11:56,820 --> 01:11:58,538
Come on, move!

640
01:12:08,580 --> 01:12:10,536
Where's Stepan?

641
01:12:12,460 --> 01:12:15,020
Where did Stepan ride to?

642
01:12:15,220 --> 01:12:17,939
I guess he went to Zvenigorod.

643
01:12:18,140 --> 01:12:20,938
All right then.

644
01:12:25,460 --> 01:12:27,416
My hands are dirty.

645
01:12:42,060 --> 01:12:46,531
We're going to build his younger
brother a mansion no worse that this.

646
01:12:46,740 --> 01:12:50,938
- He's got a better stone?
- Yes, much better.

647
01:12:51,740 --> 01:12:55,619
- Look! Stepan!
- What's he doing here?

648
01:13:03,060 --> 01:13:05,096
Hold it, old man!

649
01:13:32,380 --> 01:13:36,532
You, Goat!
Help him. Hide him in the bushes.

650
01:13:46,140 --> 01:13:47,937
Where's my whip?

651
01:13:58,980 --> 01:14:02,529
- Mikola!
- Mityai!

652
01:14:03,580 --> 01:14:06,253
Anyone seen my whip?

653
01:14:06,460 --> 01:14:09,338
Damn it!
I've lost my whip.

654
01:14:09,900 --> 01:14:12,778
Hey, Goat!
Have you seen my whip?

655
01:16:09,900 --> 01:16:13,688
Sergey, read from the Scriptures.

656
01:16:13,900 --> 01:16:17,529
- What place?
- Whatever you like.

657
01:16:34,060 --> 01:16:38,531
Now I praise you, brethren, that
you remember me in all things

658
01:16:38,740 --> 01:16:41,698
and keep the ordinances
as I delivered them to you.

659
01:16:41,900 --> 01:16:43,936
But I would have you know

660
01:16:44,140 --> 01:16:46,529
that the head of every man is Christ

661
01:16:46,740 --> 01:16:49,937
and the head of the woman is the man,
and the head of Christ is God.

662
01:16:50,740 --> 01:16:55,530
Every man praying or prophesying,
having his head covered,

663
01:16:55,740 --> 01:16:57,935
dishonoreth his head.

664
01:16:58,140 --> 01:17:03,009
But every woman that prayeth or
prophesyeth with her head uncovered

665
01:17:03,220 --> 01:17:05,176
dishonoreth her head,

666
01:17:05,380 --> 01:17:08,099
for that is even all one
as if she were shaven.

667
01:17:08,900 --> 01:17:13,018
For if the woman be not covered,
let her also be shorn.

668
01:17:13,220 --> 01:17:18,931
But if it be a shame for a woman to
be shorn or shaven, let her be covered.

669
01:17:19,740 --> 01:17:23,096
For a man indeed ought not
to cover his head,

670
01:17:23,300 --> 01:17:26,258
since he is the image
and glory of God;

671
01:17:26,460 --> 01:17:28,690
but the woman is the glory of the man.

672
01:17:28,900 --> 01:17:32,097
For the man is not of the woman,
but the woman of the man.

673
01:17:32,300 --> 01:17:35,770
Neither was the man created for
the woman, but the woman for the man.

674
01:17:35,980 --> 01:17:38,938
For this cause ought the woman
to have power on her head,

675
01:17:39,140 --> 01:17:42,177
because of the angels.

676
01:17:42,380 --> 01:17:47,932
Nevertheless, neither is the man without
woman, neither the woman without man...

677
01:17:51,740 --> 01:17:53,776
Go on.

678
01:17:59,900 --> 01:18:01,936
For as the woman is of the man, even
so is the man also by the woman;

679
01:18:02,140 --> 01:18:05,177
but all things of God.

680
01:18:05,380 --> 01:18:07,940
Judge among yourselves.
Is it proper for a woman

681
01:18:08,140 --> 01:18:11,177
praying to God uncovered?

682
01:18:11,380 --> 01:18:14,019
Doth not even nature itself teach you

683
01:18:14,220 --> 01:18:18,099
that if a man has long hair,
it is a shame onto him?

684
01:18:19,300 --> 01:18:22,929
But if a woman has long hair,
it is a glory to her;

685
01:18:23,140 --> 01:18:25,176
for her hair is given her...

686
01:19:09,380 --> 01:19:11,940
Why did you stop? Go on!

687
01:19:14,260 --> 01:19:19,175
...it is a glory to her.
For her hair is given her for...

688
01:19:19,380 --> 01:19:22,531
Danila! Listen, Danila!

689
01:19:24,380 --> 01:19:28,089
Feast! It's the feast, Danila!
And you were saying...

690
01:19:28,300 --> 01:19:30,860
They're not sinners, are they?

691
01:19:31,060 --> 01:19:35,178
How can she be a sinner,
even if she doesn't wear a kerchief?

692
01:19:47,220 --> 01:19:49,256
Some sinner!

693
01:20:14,980 --> 01:20:19,531
Leave him alone.
Let this servant of God repent.
