00:01:21,053 --> 00:01:23,044
<i>(# "A Tisket, A Tasket")</i>

2
00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:40,450
- When'll you be back, Roy?
- Oh, in a couple of weeks.

3
00:01:40,533 --> 00:01:43,491
Don't do nothing
you wouldn't want me to hear about.

4
00:01:43,573 --> 00:01:45,768
- Well, so long.
- So long.

5
00:01:52,453 --> 00:01:54,921
How about a lift, mister?

6
00:01:55,013 --> 00:01:58,449
- Can't you see that sticker?
- Sure, I see it.

7
00:01:58,533 --> 00:02:04,244
But a good guy don't pay no attention to
what some heel makes him stick on his truck.

8
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:09,930
Well, scrunch down on the running board
till we get around the bend.

9
00:02:28,253 --> 00:02:31,484
- Going far?
- No, just a couple of miles.

10
00:02:31,573 --> 00:02:36,010
I'd have walked her
if my dogs wasn't pooped out.

11
00:02:36,093 --> 00:02:38,926
- Looking for ajob?
- No. My old man's got a place.

12
00:02:39,013 --> 00:02:42,847
40 acres. He's a sharecropper,
but we've been there a long while.

13
00:02:42,933 --> 00:02:44,889
Oh.

14
00:02:45,693 --> 00:02:48,287
- Been doing ajob?
- Yeah.

15
00:02:49,773 --> 00:02:53,766
I seen your hands.
You been swinging a pick or a sledge.

16
00:02:53,853 --> 00:02:57,607
That's what makes them shiny.
I notice things like that all the time.

17
00:02:57,693 --> 00:02:59,684
Got a trade?

18
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:03,086
- Why don't you get at it, buddy?
- Get at what?

19
00:03:03,173 --> 00:03:07,291
You know. You been goin' over me since
I got in. Why don't you ask where I've been?

20
00:03:07,373 --> 00:03:10,922
I don't stick my nose in nobody's business.
I stay in my own yard.

21
00:03:11,013 --> 00:03:14,892
That big nose of yours been goin' over me
like a sheep in a vegetable patch.

22
00:03:14,973 --> 00:03:19,171
I ain't keepin' it secret. I've been
in the penitentiary. Been there four years.

23
00:03:19,253 --> 00:03:21,369
- Anything else?
- You ain't gotta get sore.

24
00:03:21,453 --> 00:03:23,364
- Ask me anything.
- I didn't mean nothing.

25
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:28,732
Me neither. I' just trying to get along
without shovin' anybody, that's all.

26
00:03:28,813 --> 00:03:32,408
See that road ahead? That's where I get out.

27
00:03:40,413 --> 00:03:46,124
You're about to bust a gut to know what I
done, ain't you? I ain't a guy to let you down.

28
00:03:46,213 --> 00:03:47,805
Homicide.

29
00:04:08,773 --> 00:04:12,322
<i># Hmm, He's</i> my saviour

30
00:04:12,413 --> 00:04:15,644
<i># Hmm, my saviour

31
00:04:16,453 --> 00:04:20,082
<i># Hmm, my saviour now

32
00:04:20,893 --> 00:04:23,282
- Howdy, friend.
- Howdy.

33
00:04:25,893 --> 00:04:27,372
Say...

34
00:04:27,453 --> 00:04:30,411
Ain't you young Tom Joad, old Tom's boy?

35
00:04:30,493 --> 00:04:33,166
Yeah. I' on my way home now.

36
00:04:33,253 --> 00:04:35,483
Well, I do declare.

37
00:04:35,573 --> 00:04:38,406
I baptised you, son.

38
00:04:38,493 --> 00:04:40,882
Ain't you the preacher?

39
00:04:44,973 --> 00:04:46,929
Used to be.

40
00:04:47,013 --> 00:04:49,004
Not no more.

41
00:04:49,093 --> 00:04:51,084
I lost the call.

42
00:04:52,173 --> 00:04:55,210
But, boy, I sure used to have it.

43
00:04:55,293 --> 00:04:58,649
I used to get an irrigation ditch
so full of repented sinners

44
00:04:58,733 --> 00:05:01,691
I'd pretty near drown half of 'em.

45
00:05:01,773 --> 00:05:03,764
But not no more.

46
00:05:05,173 --> 00:05:07,164
I lost the spirit.

47
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:13,645
I got nothing to preach about
no more, that's all.

48
00:05:13,733 --> 00:05:15,883
I ain't so sure of things.

49
00:05:15,973 --> 00:05:17,964
I remember you preaching a sermon

50
00:05:18,053 --> 00:05:22,569
walking around on your hands,
shoutin' your head off.

51
00:05:22,653 --> 00:05:24,530
Yeah, I remember.

52
00:05:24,613 --> 00:05:27,002
Went pretty good that way.

53
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:29,084
But that was nothin'

54
00:05:29,173 --> 00:05:32,768
I preached a whole sermon once
straddling the ridge pole of a barn.

55
00:05:32,853 --> 00:05:34,969
Like this.

56
00:05:38,053 --> 00:05:40,613
- Did you see that one?
- No.

57
00:05:41,773 --> 00:05:43,923
You didn't?

58
00:05:44,013 --> 00:05:45,571
Oh.

59
00:05:46,373 --> 00:05:49,092
Well, it's all gone anyway.

60
00:05:49,173 --> 00:05:52,210
You should have got yourself a wife.

61
00:05:52,293 --> 00:05:58,004
Why, at my meetings, I used to get the girls
a-glory-shoutin' till they about passed out.

62
00:05:58,093 --> 00:06:00,368
Then I'd go to comfort 'em.

63
00:06:00,453 --> 00:06:03,331
I'd always end up by loving 'em.

64
00:06:03,413 --> 00:06:07,884
I'd feel bad and pray and pray,
but it didn't do no good.

65
00:06:07,973 --> 00:06:10,203
Next time do it again.

66
00:06:10,293 --> 00:06:13,171
I figured I just wasn't worth saving.

67
00:06:13,253 --> 00:06:17,166
Pa always says you was never
cut out for no preacher.

68
00:06:17,253 --> 00:06:21,007
I never let one get by me if I could catch her.
Have a snort?

69
00:06:21,093 --> 00:06:26,292
But you wasn't a preacher.
A girl was just a girl to you.

70
00:06:26,373 --> 00:06:29,012
To me they's holy vessels.

71
00:06:30,013 --> 00:06:32,208
I was saving their souls.

72
00:06:34,533 --> 00:06:39,368
I asked myself,
what is this here called holy spirit?

73
00:06:39,453 --> 00:06:41,523
Maybe that's love.

74
00:06:41,613 --> 00:06:46,687
Why, I love everybody so much
I' fit to burst sometimes.

75
00:06:48,373 --> 00:06:53,367
So... maybe there ain't no sin
and there ain't no virtue.

76
00:06:53,453 --> 00:06:56,411
It's just what people does.

77
00:06:59,653 --> 00:07:03,851
Some things folks do is nice
and some ain't so nice.

78
00:07:03,933 --> 00:07:06,891
And that's all any man's got a right to say.

79
00:07:06,973 --> 00:07:11,808
Of course, I'll say a grace
if somebody sets out the food.

80
00:07:11,893 --> 00:07:13,929
But my heart ain't in it.

81
00:07:14,733 --> 00:07:20,251
- Nice drinkin' liquor.
- Ought to be. It's factory liquor. Cost a buck.

82
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:24,690
- You been out travelling around?
- Ain't you heard? It's been in the papers.

83
00:07:24,773 --> 00:07:28,527
- No, I never. What?
- I've been in the penitentiary for four years.

84
00:07:28,613 --> 00:07:30,604
Excuse me for asking.

85
00:07:33,573 --> 00:07:37,043
I don't mind no more.
I'd do what I done again.

86
00:07:37,853 --> 00:07:40,242
Killed a guy in a dance hall.

87
00:07:41,213 --> 00:07:45,604
We was drunk. He got a knife in me
and I laid him out with a shovel.

88
00:07:45,693 --> 00:07:49,208
- Knocked his head plumb to squash.
- You ain't ashamed?

89
00:07:49,293 --> 00:07:53,047
No. He had a knife in me.
That's why they only gave me seven years.

90
00:07:53,133 --> 00:07:55,647
I got out in four. Parole.

91
00:07:55,733 --> 00:07:59,521
- Ain't seen your folks since?
- No, but I aim to before sundown.

92
00:07:59,613 --> 00:08:01,729
And I' gettin' excited about it too.

93
00:08:01,813 --> 00:08:04,532
- Which way are you goin'
- Oh, it don't matter.

94
00:08:04,613 --> 00:08:08,891
Ever since I lost the spirit, looks like
I'd just as soon go one way as the other.

95
00:08:08,973 --> 00:08:10,964
I'll go your way.

96
00:08:13,053 --> 00:08:15,726
Maybe Ma will have pork for supper.

97
00:08:15,813 --> 00:08:20,603
I ain't had pork but four times in four years.
Every Christmas.

98
00:08:20,693 --> 00:08:22,968
I'll be glad to see your pa.

99
00:08:23,813 --> 00:08:26,646
Last time I seen him was at a baptising.

100
00:08:26,733 --> 00:08:30,442
He had one of the biggest doses
of the holy spirit I ever seen.

101
00:08:30,533 --> 00:08:35,129
Got to jumping over bushes.
Howlin' like a dog-wolf at moon-time.

102
00:08:35,213 --> 00:08:39,491
Finally, he picks himself out
a bush big as a piano

103
00:08:39,573 --> 00:08:42,929
and he lets out a squawk
and takes a run at that bush.

104
00:08:43,013 --> 00:08:45,208
<i>(howls)</i>

105
00:08:55,293 --> 00:08:57,682
Well, he cleared her.

106
00:08:57,773 --> 00:09:00,845
But he bust his leg snap in two doing it.

107
00:09:01,653 --> 00:09:05,885
There was a travelling dentist and he set
her and I gave her a praying over, but...

108
00:09:05,973 --> 00:09:10,649
there wasn't no more holy spirit
left in your pa after that.

109
00:09:10,733 --> 00:09:13,167
<i>(wind howling)</i>

110
00:09:13,253 --> 00:09:18,088
- Listen. That wind's fixing to do something.
- Sure it is.

111
00:09:18,173 --> 00:09:20,448
Always is this time of year.

112
00:09:50,853 --> 00:09:52,650
Ma?

113
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:55,690
Pa?

114
00:09:57,453 --> 00:09:59,250
Ma?

115
00:10:01,213 --> 00:10:03,204
Ain't nobody here.

116
00:10:05,053 --> 00:10:08,443
- Something's happened.
- You got a match?

117
00:10:28,373 --> 00:10:30,648
They're all gone or dead.

118
00:10:30,733 --> 00:10:36,126
- They never wrote you nothing?
- No. They wasn't people to write.

119
00:10:42,613 --> 00:10:45,286
It's Ma's. She had 'em for years.

120
00:11:05,613 --> 00:11:09,891
Used to be mine.
I gave it to Grandpa when I went away.

121
00:11:16,093 --> 00:11:18,766
You reckon they're dead?

122
00:11:18,853 --> 00:11:22,926
- I never heard nothing about it.
<i>- (door creaks)</i>

123
00:11:27,533 --> 00:11:29,524
<i>(man)</i> Tommy?

124
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:36,812
Muley.

125
00:11:36,893 --> 00:11:39,566
- Where's my folks, Muley?
- Why, they gone.

126
00:11:39,653 --> 00:11:42,804
I know they're gone,
but where are they gone?

127
00:11:42,893 --> 00:11:46,090
It's Muley Graves.
You remember the preacher, don't you?

128
00:11:46,173 --> 00:11:49,768
- I ain't no preacher any more.
- All right. You remember the <i>man?</i>

129
00:11:49,853 --> 00:11:52,651
- Glad to see you again.
- Now, where are my folks?

130
00:11:52,733 --> 00:11:58,012
They gone. They gone to your Uncle John's.
The whole crowd of 'em. Two weeks ago.

131
00:11:58,093 --> 00:12:01,369
But they can't stay there,
cos John's got <i>his</i> notice to get off.

132
00:12:01,453 --> 00:12:04,365
What happened?
How come they gotta get off?

133
00:12:04,453 --> 00:12:07,206
We lived here 50 years, same place.

134
00:12:07,693 --> 00:12:12,084
Everybody's gotta get off.
Everybody's leaving. Going out to California.

135
00:12:12,173 --> 00:12:15,563
Your folks, my folks, everybody's folks.

136
00:12:15,653 --> 00:12:18,963
Everybody except me. I ain't getting off!

137
00:12:19,493 --> 00:12:21,802
- Who done it?
- Listen.

138
00:12:21,893 --> 00:12:26,603
That's some of what done it.
The dusters. They started it, anyways.

139
00:12:26,693 --> 00:12:29,287
Blowin' like this year after year.

140
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:32,445
Blowin' the land away.
Blowin' the crops away!

141
00:12:32,533 --> 00:12:35,001
Blowin' us away now.

142
00:12:36,013 --> 00:12:38,004
Are you crazy?

143
00:12:38,093 --> 00:12:40,926
Some say I am.
You wanna hear how it happened?

144
00:12:41,013 --> 00:12:43,402
That's what I' asking you, ain't it?

145
00:12:43,493 --> 00:12:46,451
Well... the way it happens,

146
00:12:46,533 --> 00:12:49,206
the way it happened to me...

147
00:12:49,293 --> 00:12:50,965
A man come one day...

148
00:12:51,773 --> 00:12:56,244
After what them dusters done to the land,
the tenant system don't work no more.

149
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:58,801
They don't break even,
much less show profit.

150
00:12:58,893 --> 00:13:02,203
One man and a tractor
can handle 12 or 14 of these places.

151
00:13:02,293 --> 00:13:04,568
You just pay him a wage
and take all the crop.

152
00:13:04,653 --> 00:13:09,681
Yeah, but we couldn't do
on any less than what our share is now.

153
00:13:09,773 --> 00:13:14,164
The children ain't getting enough
to eat as it is. And they're so ragged,

154
00:13:14,253 --> 00:13:17,643
we'd be ashamed if everybody else's
children wasn't the same.

155
00:13:17,733 --> 00:13:21,328
I can't help that. I got my orders.
They told me to tell you to get off.

156
00:13:21,413 --> 00:13:24,450
- That's what I' tellin' you.
- You mean get off my own land?

157
00:13:24,533 --> 00:13:27,809
- Don't go to blaming me. It ain't my fault.
- Whose fault is it?

158
00:13:27,893 --> 00:13:31,090
You know who owns the land.
Shawnee Land and Cattle Company.

159
00:13:31,173 --> 00:13:34,688
- Who's Shawnee Land and Cattle Company?
- Nobody. It's a company.

160
00:13:34,773 --> 00:13:39,005
They got a president. They got
somebody who knows what a shotgun's for!

161
00:13:39,093 --> 00:13:42,483
Oh, son, it ain't his fault
because the bank tells him what to do.

162
00:13:42,573 --> 00:13:46,725
- All right. Where's the bank?
- Tulsa. What's the use of picking on him?

163
00:13:46,813 --> 00:13:51,170
He ain't nothing but the manager. He's half
crazy trying to keep up with his orders.

164
00:13:51,253 --> 00:13:54,529
- Then who do we shoot?
- Brother, I don't know.

165
00:13:54,613 --> 00:13:58,162
If I did, I'd tell you.
I just don't know who's to blame.

166
00:13:58,253 --> 00:14:02,405
I' right here to tell you, mister: there ain't
nobody gonna push me off my land!

167
00:14:02,493 --> 00:14:05,690
My grandpa took up this land 70 years ago!

168
00:14:05,773 --> 00:14:11,564
My pa was born here. We was all born on it!
And some of us was killed on it!

169
00:14:20,853 --> 00:14:23,925
And some of us... died on it.

170
00:14:25,053 --> 00:14:27,169
That's what makes it our'n.

171
00:14:27,253 --> 00:14:29,483
Being born on it,

172
00:14:29,573 --> 00:14:32,406
and workin' on it...

173
00:14:33,213 --> 00:14:36,285
and dying... dying on it!

174
00:14:36,373 --> 00:14:40,127
And not no piece of paper with writing on it...

175
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:42,204
<i>(sobs)</i>

176
00:14:52,493 --> 00:14:54,484
Well, what happened?

177
00:14:57,133 --> 00:15:01,206
They come. They come and pushed me off.

178
00:15:01,293 --> 00:15:03,363
- They come with the cats.
- The what?

179
00:15:03,453 --> 00:15:06,525
The cats, the caterpillar tractors.

180
00:15:27,493 --> 00:15:34,012
And for every one of 'em, there was ten,
15 families thrown right out of their homes.

181
00:15:34,093 --> 00:15:38,803
100 folks. And no place to live
but on the road.

182
00:15:38,893 --> 00:15:43,171
The Rances, the Peterses,
the Perrys, the Joadses...

183
00:15:43,253 --> 00:15:46,404
One right after the other, they got thrown out.

184
00:15:46,493 --> 00:15:51,009
Half the folks you and me know
thrown right out into the road.

185
00:15:52,733 --> 00:15:56,203
The one that got me come about a month ago.

186
00:15:57,093 --> 00:15:58,970
Go on back!

187
00:15:59,053 --> 00:16:03,365
Go on back! I' warning you! Go on back!

188
00:16:12,653 --> 00:16:16,089
You come any closer
and I' gonna blow you right out of that cat!

189
00:16:16,173 --> 00:16:18,641
I told you!

190
00:16:19,973 --> 00:16:24,171
- You're Joe Davis' boy.
- I don't like for nobody to draw a bead on me.

191
00:16:24,253 --> 00:16:27,290
Then what are you doing this for?
Against your own people.

192
00:16:27,373 --> 00:16:30,046
Three dollars a day,
that's what I' doing it for.

193
00:16:30,133 --> 00:16:35,207
I got two little kids at home. My wife.
My wife's mother. Them folks gotta eat.

194
00:16:35,293 --> 00:16:39,605
First and only, I think about my folks.
What happens to others is their own lookout.

195
00:16:39,693 --> 00:16:43,003
Yeah, but you don't understand, son.
This is my land!

196
00:16:43,093 --> 00:16:45,288
Used to be. It's the company's now.

197
00:16:45,373 --> 00:16:50,322
Have it your own way, son. Butjust as sure
as you touch my house with that cat,

198
00:16:50,413 --> 00:16:53,291
I' gonna blow you plumb to kingdom come!

199
00:16:53,373 --> 00:16:57,685
You ain't gonna blow nobody nowhere!
First place, they'd hang you and you know it.

200
00:16:57,773 --> 00:17:01,083
It wouldn't be two days before
they'd send a guy to take my place.

201
00:17:01,173 --> 00:17:03,846
Now go on! Get outta the way!

202
00:17:41,573 --> 00:17:44,690
What was the use? He was right.

203
00:17:44,773 --> 00:17:48,607
There wasn't a thing in the world
I could do about it.

204
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:54,450
It's just... it don't seem possible
just getting throwed off like that.

205
00:17:54,533 --> 00:17:57,206
The rest of my family set out for the West.

206
00:17:57,293 --> 00:18:03,528
There wasn't nothing to eat, but... I couldn't
leave. Something just wouldn't let me.

207
00:18:03,613 --> 00:18:08,767
So now I just wander around
and sleep wherever I am.

208
00:18:11,613 --> 00:18:14,650
I used to tell myself
that I was looking out for things

209
00:18:14,733 --> 00:18:19,443
so that when the folks come back,
everything would be all right.

210
00:18:19,533 --> 00:18:21,967
But I knowed it wasn't true.

211
00:18:22,773 --> 00:18:25,412
There ain't nothin' to look out for.

212
00:18:25,493 --> 00:18:28,769
And there ain't nobody ever coming back.

213
00:18:28,853 --> 00:18:30,844
They're gone!

214
00:18:31,933 --> 00:18:33,924
And me...

215
00:18:34,013 --> 00:18:37,244
I' just an old graveyard ghost.

216
00:18:39,373 --> 00:18:41,967
That's all in the world I am.

217
00:18:44,613 --> 00:18:46,683
Do you think I' touched?

218
00:18:51,413 --> 00:18:53,404
No.

219
00:18:53,493 --> 00:18:56,087
You're lonely, but...

220
00:18:56,173 --> 00:18:59,051
you ain't touched.

221
00:18:59,133 --> 00:19:03,684
Well, it don't matter. If I' touched,
I' touched and that's all there is to it.

222
00:19:03,773 --> 00:19:08,210
The thing I don't understand
is my folks taking it. Like Ma.

223
00:19:08,293 --> 00:19:11,763
I seen her nearly beat
a pedlar to death with a live chicken.

224
00:19:11,853 --> 00:19:16,290
She aimed to go with an axe in the other
hand, got mixed up, forgot which was which.

225
00:19:16,373 --> 00:19:21,163
When she got through with that pedlar,
all she had left was two chicken legs.

226
00:19:21,253 --> 00:19:23,005
Just a...

227
00:19:23,093 --> 00:19:26,449
Just a plain old graveyard ghost.

228
00:19:27,693 --> 00:19:29,684
That's all.

229
00:19:43,373 --> 00:19:45,364
She's settling.

230
00:19:49,413 --> 00:19:51,973
What do you figure on doing?

231
00:19:52,053 --> 00:19:54,044
It's hard to say.

232
00:19:54,133 --> 00:19:58,092
Stay here till morning,
go to Uncle John's, I reckon.

233
00:19:58,173 --> 00:20:00,641
After that, I don't know.

234
00:20:02,093 --> 00:20:03,685
Listen.

235
00:20:10,973 --> 00:20:14,124
That's them. Them lights.

236
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,647
Come on. Come on. We gotta hide out.

237
00:20:16,733 --> 00:20:19,964
Hide out for what? We ain't doing nothing.

238
00:20:20,053 --> 00:20:25,127
You're trespassing. This ain't your land no
more! That's the superintendent with a gun.

239
00:20:25,213 --> 00:20:28,683
- Come on!
- Come on, Tom. You're on parole.

240
00:20:50,653 --> 00:20:52,450
Muley!

00:21:06,093 --> 00:21:09,165
All you gotta do is hide and watch.

243
00:21:09,253 --> 00:21:12,848
- Won't they come out here?
- <i>(chuckles)</i> I don't think so.

244
00:21:12,933 --> 00:21:15,606
- One came out once and I clipped him...
- Shh!

245
00:21:15,693 --> 00:21:17,809
...from behind with a fence stake.

246
00:21:17,893 --> 00:21:20,123
They ain't bothered since.

247
00:21:24,613 --> 00:21:26,604
He ain't here.

248
00:21:35,733 --> 00:21:40,284
Anybody ever told me
I'd be hiding out in my own place...

Lord, make us grateful for what
we are about to receive, for His sake. Amen.

252
00:22:01,293 --> 00:22:03,648
I seen you. You ate during grace.

253
00:22:03,733 --> 00:22:07,612
Just one little dab.
Just one teeny little old dab. That's all.

254
00:22:07,693 --> 00:22:11,971
- Ain't he messy though.
- I seen him. Gobbling away like an old pig.

255
00:22:12,053 --> 00:22:14,726
Why don't you keep
your eyes shut during grace?

256
00:22:14,813 --> 00:22:17,043
What's it say again, Uncle John?

257
00:22:18,133 --> 00:22:23,651
It says, " Plenty of work in California.
800 pickers wanted."

258
00:22:28,733 --> 00:22:34,091
Wait till I get to California. I' gonna reach up
and pick me an orange whenever I want it.

259
00:22:34,173 --> 00:22:38,769
Or some grapes. Now-now-now, there's
something I ain't never had enough of.

260
00:22:38,853 --> 00:22:42,323
I' gonna get me
a whole big bunch of grapes off a bush

261
00:22:42,413 --> 00:22:47,487
and I' gonna squash 'em all over my face
and let the juice drain down off of my chin.

262
00:22:47,573 --> 00:22:49,928
Praise the Lord for victory!

263
00:22:50,013 --> 00:22:53,164
Maybe I'll get me
a whole washtub full of grapes

264
00:22:53,253 --> 00:22:58,885
and just sit in 'em and scrounge
around in 'em until they're all gone.

265
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:07,284
I sure would like that.
Yes, sir, I sure would like that.

266
00:23:26,173 --> 00:23:28,607
Oh, thank God. Thank God.

267
00:23:29,693 --> 00:23:31,684
Tommy.

268
00:23:36,293 --> 00:23:38,284
Ma.

269
00:23:43,493 --> 00:23:49,329
- You didn't bust out? You ain't gotta hide?
- No, Ma. I' paroled. I got my papers.

270
00:23:50,533 --> 00:23:51,852
Oh.

271
00:23:51,933 --> 00:23:58,122
I was just scared we was going away without
you and we'd never see each other again.

272
00:23:58,213 --> 00:24:00,602
I'd have found you, Ma.

273
00:24:04,493 --> 00:24:06,802
Muley told me what happened.

274
00:24:06,893 --> 00:24:08,884
We going to California true?

275
00:24:08,973 --> 00:24:11,692
We've gotta go, Tommy,
but it's gonna be all right.

276
00:24:11,773 --> 00:24:16,528
I seen the handbills about how much
work there is, and high wages too.

277
00:24:17,653 --> 00:24:22,647
There's something I gotta find out first,
Tommy. Did they hurt you, son?

278
00:24:22,733 --> 00:24:26,123
- Did they hurt you and make you mean mad?
- Mad, Ma?

279
00:24:26,213 --> 00:24:29,922
- Sometimes they do.
- No, Ma. I was at first, but not no more.

280
00:24:30,013 --> 00:24:32,447
Sometimes they do something to you.

281
00:24:32,533 --> 00:24:35,605
They hurt you and you get mad
and then you get mean.

282
00:24:35,693 --> 00:24:38,685
And they hurt you again
and you get meaner and meaner,

283
00:24:38,773 --> 00:24:43,847
till you ain't no boy nor man any more,
just a walking chunk of mean mad.

284
00:24:43,933 --> 00:24:47,972
- Did they hurt you that way, son?
- No, Ma. Don't worry about that.

285
00:24:48,053 --> 00:24:49,566
Well, I...

286
00:24:49,653 --> 00:24:51,883
I don't want no mean son.

287
00:24:52,213 --> 00:24:54,886
It's Tommy. It's Tommy back.

288
00:24:54,973 --> 00:24:57,168
What did you do, son? Bust out?

289

You can't keep a Joad in jail.

I knowed it from the first.

Tom would come bustin' out of thatjail

You can't keep a Joad in jail.

294
00:25:17,133 --> 00:25:20,648
- I didn't bust out. They paroled me.
- I was that way myself.

- Hello, Tommy. I' feeling fine.

- Fine, Tommy. Bust out?

I reckon we better begin rousting them out
if we aim to get out by daylight.

325
00:27:42,293 --> 00:27:44,443
How about it, John? How you boys coming?

326
00:27:45,173 --> 00:27:47,164
<i>(# "Red River Valley")</i>

327
00:29:12,733 --> 00:29:14,132
<i>(Tommy)</i> Ma.

328
00:29:14,213 --> 00:29:16,204
I' ready.

329
00:29:23,773 --> 00:29:29,052
Rosasharn, honey. Wake up the children.
We're fixing to leave.

330
00:29:30,293 --> 00:29:32,648
Ruthie. Winfield. Jump up now.

331
00:29:33,773 --> 00:29:38,642
- Where's Grandpa? Al, go get him.
- I' gonna get up front. Somebody help me.

332
00:29:38,733 --> 00:29:40,166
Wait.

333
00:29:40,253 --> 00:29:43,563
- Kids, you climb up on top first.
- We're going to California!

334
00:29:43,653 --> 00:29:47,362
Al's gonna drive, Ma. Sit with him
and Grandma and we'll swap later.

335
00:29:47,453 --> 00:29:52,049
Connie. Help Rosasharn
up there alongside the kids.

336
00:29:52,973 --> 00:29:55,771
- Where's Grandpa?
- Grandpa!

337
00:29:55,853 --> 00:29:58,651
Where he always is, probably.

338
00:29:58,733 --> 00:30:00,405
Oh.

339
00:30:00,933 --> 00:30:03,572
Grandpa! Grandpa!

340
00:30:03,653 --> 00:30:07,089
Save him a place. John, you and Noah
climb up and find a place.

341
00:30:07,173 --> 00:30:10,131
Got to kind of keep her even all around.

342
00:30:19,173 --> 00:30:24,122
- Think it'll hold?
- If it does, it'll be a miracle out of Scripture.

343
00:30:24,213 --> 00:30:26,169
Ma. Pa.

344
00:30:26,253 --> 00:30:30,007
Let go of me, goldurn you! Dang you!

345
00:30:30,093 --> 00:30:33,165
Please. There's something
the matter with him.

346
00:30:33,253 --> 00:30:37,963
- Why don't you stand still!
- There's something wrong with him.

347
00:30:40,493 --> 00:30:44,281
- You let me alone, that's all.
- That's all what?

348
00:30:44,373 --> 00:30:47,331
What's the matter, Grandpa?

349
00:30:47,413 --> 00:30:51,326
What's the matter?
There's nothing the matter. I just...

350
00:30:51,413 --> 00:30:54,849
- I just ain't going, that's all.
- What do you mean? We gotta go.

351
00:30:54,933 --> 00:30:56,924
We got no place to stay.

352
00:30:57,013 --> 00:31:01,291
I ain't talking about you. I' talking about me.

353
00:31:01,373 --> 00:31:06,163
I give her a good going over
all last night and I' staying.

354
00:31:06,253 --> 00:31:10,292
But you can't do that, Grandpa.
This here land's going under the tractor.

355
00:31:10,373 --> 00:31:14,525
- We all got to get out.
- All except me and I' staying.

356
00:31:14,613 --> 00:31:18,049
- What about Grandma?
- Take her with you!

357
00:31:18,133 --> 00:31:21,569
Who'd cook for you, Grandpa?
How are you gonna live?

358
00:31:21,653 --> 00:31:26,090
Muley's living, ain't he?
And I' twice the man that Muley is.

359
00:31:26,173 --> 00:31:29,370
Now, listen to me, Grandpa.
Listen to me just a minute.

360
00:31:29,453 --> 00:31:31,569
And I ain't listening either.

361
00:31:31,653 --> 00:31:36,852
I told you what I was gonna do
and I don't give a hoot and a holler

362
00:31:36,933 --> 00:31:40,642
if there's oranges and grapes
crowding a fella out of bed.

363
00:31:40,733 --> 00:31:43,964
I ain't going to California.

364
00:31:44,053 --> 00:31:48,922
Goldurn! This is my country
and I belong here.

365
00:31:49,013 --> 00:31:51,208
Yes, sir.

366
00:31:51,293 --> 00:31:54,091
It's my dirt.

367
00:31:54,173 --> 00:31:57,085
It's no good, but it's...

368
00:31:57,173 --> 00:32:00,165
it's mine, all mine.

369
00:32:00,253 --> 00:32:05,088
Either we got to tie him up and throw him
in the truck, or something. He can't stay here.

370
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:10,201
No, can't tie him. Either we'll hurt him,
or he'll get so mad, he'll hurt himself.

371
00:32:10,293 --> 00:32:13,444
- Reckon we could get him drunk?
- Ain't no whiskey, is there?

372
00:32:13,533 --> 00:32:18,368
Now, wait. There's a half a bottle
of soothing syrup here.

373
00:32:20,493 --> 00:32:23,769
Here. Used to put the children to sleep.

374
00:32:25,773 --> 00:32:29,083
- Don't taste bad.
- There's coffee left. We can fix him a cup.

375
00:32:29,173 --> 00:32:32,563
- That's right, douse some in it.
- Better give him a good dose.

376
00:32:32,653 --> 00:32:35,247
He's mighty muleheaded.

377
00:32:35,333 --> 00:32:36,925
If Muley...

378
00:32:37,013 --> 00:32:40,244
If Muley can scramble along, I...

379
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:42,324
I guess I can.

380
00:32:44,653 --> 00:32:46,644
I smell spareribs.

381
00:32:48,413 --> 00:32:52,725
Somebody's been eating spareribs.
How come I ain't got none?

382
00:32:52,813 --> 00:32:56,442
Well, I got some saved for you, Grandpa.
Got some warming now.

383
00:32:56,533 --> 00:33:00,162
But here's a cup of coffee for you first.

384
00:33:00,253 --> 00:33:03,086
Get me a mess of spareribs.

385
00:33:03,173 --> 00:33:06,961
I want a great big mess of spareribs.

386
00:33:07,053 --> 00:33:11,410
- I'... I' hungry.
- Why, sure you're hungry.

387
00:33:20,933 --> 00:33:24,448
I... sure do like spareribs.

388
00:33:31,653 --> 00:33:35,726
- Get up there, Noah.
- Put his feet in there first, Tom.

389
00:33:36,533 --> 00:33:38,524
Easy, now. Easy!

390
00:33:40,373 --> 00:33:43,922
Better throw something over him
so he won't get sunstruck.

391
00:33:44,013 --> 00:33:48,086
Everything all set now?
All right, let her go, Al.

392
00:33:50,373 --> 00:33:52,284
Get aboard, Ma.

393
00:33:52,373 --> 00:33:56,252
- Well, goodbye and good luck.
- Hold her, Al.

394
00:33:56,333 --> 00:33:58,608
Ain't you goin' with us?

395
00:33:58,693 --> 00:34:00,365
I'd like to.

396
00:34:00,453 --> 00:34:05,607
There's something going on out there in the
West and I'd like to try and learn what it is.

397
00:34:05,693 --> 00:34:08,287
If you feel you've got the room.

398
00:34:10,293 --> 00:34:12,329
Plenty of room. Get on.

399
00:34:12,413 --> 00:34:16,201
- Let her go, Al!
- California, here we come!

400
00:34:35,013 --> 00:34:38,164
Ain't you gonna look back, Ma?
Give the old place a last look?

401
00:34:38,253 --> 00:34:42,246
We're going to California, ain't we?
All right then, let's go to California.

402
00:34:42,333 --> 00:34:45,325
That don't sound like you.
You never was like that before.

403
00:34:45,413 --> 00:34:48,723
I never had my house pushed over before.

404
00:34:48,813 --> 00:34:51,611
Never had my family stuck out on the road.

405
00:34:51,693 --> 00:34:55,163
Never had to lose everything I had in life.

406
00:36:03,653 --> 00:36:07,089
- It's gonna be all right, Grandpa.
- I ain't going.

407
00:36:07,173 --> 00:36:10,404
I ain't going. I ain't going.

408
00:36:10,493 --> 00:36:13,087
I ain't going.

409
00:36:15,373 --> 00:36:17,489
It's all right, Grandpa.

410
00:36:17,573 --> 00:36:20,167
You're just tired, that's all.

411
00:36:20,973 --> 00:36:23,203
That's it.

412
00:36:23,293 --> 00:36:25,488
Just tired.

413
00:36:27,253 --> 00:36:29,050
Just...

414
00:36:29,853 --> 00:36:31,650
tired.

415
00:37:02,413 --> 00:37:08,363
"This here is William James Joad.
Died of a stroke, old, old man."

416
00:37:09,373 --> 00:37:15,846
"His folks buried him because
they got no money to pay for funeral... s."

417
00:37:22,533 --> 00:37:26,446
"Nobody killed him.
Just a stroke and he died."

418
00:37:30,213 --> 00:37:33,842
I figure best we leave
something like this on him,

419
00:37:33,933 --> 00:37:38,802
'lest somebody digs him up
and makes out he was killed.

420
00:37:38,893 --> 00:37:43,808
Looks like a lot of times the government's got
more interest in a dead man than a live one.

421
00:37:43,893 --> 00:37:47,329
Not be so lonesome,
knowing his name's there with him.

422
00:37:47,413 --> 00:37:51,167
Notjust an old fella lonesome underground.

423
00:37:52,973 --> 00:37:56,204
Would you say a few words, Casy?

424
00:37:56,293 --> 00:37:59,285
I ain't a preacher no more, you know.

425
00:37:59,373 --> 00:38:04,925
We know, but ain't none of our folks
ever been buried without a few words.

426
00:38:07,293 --> 00:38:09,682
I'll say 'em, make it short.

427
00:38:15,893 --> 00:38:18,361
This here old man just...

428
00:38:18,453 --> 00:38:21,445
lived a life and just died out of it.

429
00:38:21,533 --> 00:38:24,889
I don't know whether he was good or bad.

430
00:38:24,973 --> 00:38:27,168
It don't matter much.

431
00:38:28,133 --> 00:38:30,886
Heard a fella say a poem once.

432
00:38:30,973 --> 00:38:34,045
And he says, "All that lives is holy."

433
00:38:35,333 --> 00:38:38,450
Well, I wouldn't pray
just for an old man that's dead,

434
00:38:38,533 --> 00:38:41,093
cos he's all right.

435
00:38:41,173 --> 00:38:47,043
If I was to pray, I'd pray for folks that's
alive and don't know which way to turn.

436
00:38:47,133 --> 00:38:49,806
Grandpa here...

437
00:38:49,893 --> 00:38:53,124
he ain't got no more trouble like that.

438
00:38:53,213 --> 00:38:59,083
He's got his job all cut out for him,
so cover him up and let him get to it.

439
00:39:48,853 --> 00:39:54,291
<i># I' going down the road feeling bad

440
00:39:54,493 --> 00:40:00,204
<i># I' going down the road feeling bad

441
00:40:00,893 --> 00:40:07,162
<i># I' going down the road feeling bad,
oh lordy

442
00:40:07,253 --> 00:40:12,805
<i># I ain't going to be treated this way

443
00:40:13,933 --> 00:40:19,963
<i># They fed me on corn bread and beans

444
00:40:20,173 --> 00:40:26,123
<i># They fed me on corn bread and beans

445
00:40:26,213 --> 00:40:30,570
Gosh, Connie sure sings pretty, don't he?

446
00:40:30,653 --> 00:40:32,883
<i># Oh lordy

447
00:40:32,973 --> 00:40:38,764
<i># I ain't going to be treated this way

448
00:40:41,493 --> 00:40:46,772
- That's my son-in-law.
- Sings real nice. What state you all from?

449
00:40:46,853 --> 00:40:50,687
Oklahoma. Had us a farm there,
sharecropping.

450
00:40:50,773 --> 00:40:53,412
We're from Arkansas.

451
00:40:53,493 --> 00:40:57,930
Had me a store there.
Kind of a general notions store.

452
00:40:58,013 --> 00:41:01,403
When the farms went, the stores went too.

453
00:41:02,213 --> 00:41:05,967
I had as nice a little store as you ever saw.

454
00:41:06,053 --> 00:41:09,090
I sure did hate to give it up.

455
00:41:09,533 --> 00:41:11,763
Well, you can't tell.

456
00:41:11,853 --> 00:41:14,651
I figure when we get out there
and get work,

457
00:41:14,733 --> 00:41:18,931
maybe get us a piece of growing land
near water, it might not be so bad at that.

458
00:41:19,013 --> 00:41:21,686
That's right. Paying good wages, I hear.

459
00:41:21,773 --> 00:41:25,322
- We can all get work.
- Can't be no worse than home.

460
00:41:25,413 --> 00:41:27,608
You all must have a pot of money.

461
00:41:27,693 --> 00:41:32,448
No, we ain't got no money, but there's
plenty of us to work and we're all good men.

462
00:41:32,533 --> 00:41:37,527
Get good wages out there and put it
all together and we'll be all right.

463
00:41:37,613 --> 00:41:40,605
Good wages, eh?
Picking oranges and peaches?

464
00:41:40,693 --> 00:41:44,732
- Well, we aim to take whatever they got.
- What's so funny about that?

465
00:41:44,813 --> 00:41:47,691
What's so funny about it?
I've just been out there.

466
00:41:47,773 --> 00:41:51,448
I've been and seen it.
I' going back and starve

467
00:41:51,533 --> 00:41:54,093
because I'd rather starve all over at once.

468
00:41:54,173 --> 00:41:59,566
What do you think you're talking about? I got
a handbill says they're paying good wages.

469
00:41:59,653 --> 00:42:01,848
I seen in the papers they need pickers.

470
00:42:01,933 --> 00:42:04,572
All right, go on. Nobody's stopping you.

471
00:42:04,653 --> 00:42:07,929
- Yeah, but what about this?
- I ain't gonna rile you. Go on.

472
00:42:08,013 --> 00:42:12,928
Wait a minute, buddy. You just done
some jackassin' You can't shut up now.

473
00:42:13,013 --> 00:42:17,165
It says they need 800 pickers. You laugh
and say they don't. Which one's the liar?

474
00:42:17,253 --> 00:42:20,689
- How many of you all got them handbills?
- I got one.

475
00:42:20,773 --> 00:42:23,492
- I got one.
- We all got one.

476
00:42:23,573 --> 00:42:28,931
- What does that prove?
- There you are. Same yellow handbill.

477
00:42:29,013 --> 00:42:30,969
800 pickers wanted.

478
00:42:31,053 --> 00:42:35,649
All right, the man wants 800 men.
So he prints 5,000 handbills

479
00:42:35,733 --> 00:42:37,963
and maybe 20,000 people see 'em.

480
00:42:38,053 --> 00:42:42,171
And maybe two or 3,000 people start west
on account of that handbill.

481
00:42:42,253 --> 00:42:45,484
Two or 3,000 people that are crazy with worry

482
00:42:45,573 --> 00:42:49,122
heading out for 800 jobs.
Now, does that make sense?

483
00:42:49,213 --> 00:42:53,809
Say, what are you, a troublemaker?
You sure you ain't one of them labour fakes?

484
00:42:53,893 --> 00:42:55,804
I... I swear I ain't, mister.

485
00:42:55,893 --> 00:43:00,364
Don't you go around here
trying to stir up any trouble.

486
00:43:00,453 --> 00:43:04,287
I tried to tell you folks
what it took me a year to find out.

487
00:43:04,373 --> 00:43:10,482
Took two kids dead. Took my wife dead to
show me. But nobody could tell me neither.

488
00:43:10,573 --> 00:43:15,567
I can't tell you about them little fellows laying
in the tent with their bellies swelled out

489
00:43:15,653 --> 00:43:17,803
and just skin over their bones.

490
00:43:17,893 --> 00:43:20,726
Shivering and whining like pups.

491
00:43:20,813 --> 00:43:23,202
And me running around looking for work.

492
00:43:23,293 --> 00:43:26,205
Not for money. Not for wages.

493
00:43:26,293 --> 00:43:29,251
Just for a cup of flour and a spoon of lard.

494
00:43:29,333 --> 00:43:31,369
Then the coroner come.

495
00:43:31,453 --> 00:43:36,402
"Them children died of heart failure," he said.
He put it down in his paper.

496
00:43:36,493 --> 00:43:38,484
Heart failure?

497
00:43:38,573 --> 00:43:43,044
And their little bellies
stuck out like a pig bladder.

498
00:43:44,813 --> 00:43:48,089
Well, it's late. I got to get some sleep.

499
00:43:49,933 --> 00:43:51,412
Well...

500
00:43:51,493 --> 00:43:53,484
Good night, folks.

501
00:44:05,933 --> 00:44:09,972
Suppose he's telling the truth, that fella?

502
00:44:10,053 --> 00:44:12,487
He's telling the truth.

503
00:44:12,573 --> 00:44:14,882
The truth for him.

504
00:44:14,973 --> 00:44:17,362
He wasn't making it up.

505
00:44:17,453 --> 00:44:20,092
Was it the truth for us?

506
00:44:20,173 --> 00:44:22,164
I don't know.

507
00:45:10,453 --> 00:45:12,569
I got to get out, I tell you.

508
00:45:12,653 --> 00:45:14,644
I gotta get out now.

509
00:45:23,493 --> 00:45:27,406
- You folks aim to buy anything?
- We want some gas, mister.

510
00:45:27,493 --> 00:45:30,883
- Got any money?
- What do you think? We're begging?

511
00:45:30,973 --> 00:45:35,649
- I just asked, that's all.
- Well, ask right. You ain't talking to bums.

512
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:38,531
All in the world I done was ask.

513
00:45:39,293 --> 00:45:43,172
- What kind of pie you got?
- Banana, pineapple, chocolate and apple.

514
00:45:43,253 --> 00:45:45,813
Cut me a hunk of that banana cream
and a cup ofjava.

515
00:45:45,893 --> 00:45:48,282
- Make it two.
- Two it is.

516
00:45:48,373 --> 00:45:50,967
Seen any good etchings lately, Bill?

517
00:45:51,053 --> 00:45:55,843
Well, this one ain't bad. A little kid
comes late for school and the teacher says...

518
00:45:55,933 --> 00:45:57,924
Cheese it.

519
00:45:58,733 --> 00:46:01,964
Could you see your way clear
to sell us a loaf of bread, ma'am?

520
00:46:02,053 --> 00:46:05,204
This ain't a grocery store.
We got bread to make sandwiches.

521
00:46:05,293 --> 00:46:09,332
I know, ma'am. Only, it's for an old lady.

522
00:46:09,413 --> 00:46:14,248
No teeth. Got to soften it with water
so she can chew it, and she's hungry.

523
00:46:14,333 --> 00:46:16,767
Why don't you buy a sandwich?
We got nice ones.

524
00:46:16,853 --> 00:46:22,564
Well, I sure would like to do that, ma'am.
But the fact is, we ain't got but a dime for it.

525
00:46:22,653 --> 00:46:25,121
It's all figured out - I mean for the trip.

526
00:46:25,213 --> 00:46:29,331
You can't buy no loaf of bread for a dime.
We only got 15-cent loaves.

527
00:46:29,413 --> 00:46:32,644
- Give him the bread.
- We'll run out before the bread truck comes!

528
00:46:32,733 --> 00:46:35,122
All right, then we run out!

529
00:46:58,733 --> 00:47:00,803
This here's a 15-cent loaf.

530
00:47:00,893 --> 00:47:05,171
Well, would you... could you see your way
to cutting off ten cents worth?

531
00:47:05,253 --> 00:47:09,724
- Give him the loaf.
- No, sir. We wanna buy ten cents worth.

532
00:47:09,813 --> 00:47:12,202
Go on, it's yesterday's bread.

533
00:47:12,293 --> 00:47:15,603
Go ahead. Bert says to take it.

534
00:47:15,693 --> 00:47:20,972
Well, it may sound funny, being so tight,
but we got 1,000 miles to go

535
00:47:21,053 --> 00:47:23,692
and we don't know if we'll make it.

536
00:47:30,053 --> 00:47:32,169
Is them penny candies, ma'am?

537
00:47:32,253 --> 00:47:34,926
- Which ones?
- There, them stripy ones.

538
00:47:35,013 --> 00:47:36,844
Oh, them.

539
00:47:36,933 --> 00:47:39,606
Well... no.

540
00:47:39,693 --> 00:47:43,686
- Them's two for a penny.
- Give us two then, ma'am.

541
00:47:47,653 --> 00:47:50,292
Go on, take 'em, take 'em.

542
00:47:50,373 --> 00:47:52,364
Thank you, ma'am.

543
00:47:59,653 --> 00:48:03,441
- Them ain't two-for-a-cent candy.
- What's it to you?

544
00:48:03,533 --> 00:48:09,529
- Them's a-nickel-apiece candy.
- We better get going. We're dropping time.

545
00:48:13,693 --> 00:48:16,207
- So long.
- Wait a minute, you got change coming.

546
00:48:16,293 --> 00:48:18,284
What's it to you?

547
00:48:25,613 --> 00:48:27,410
Bert.

548
00:48:28,933 --> 00:48:30,730
Look.

549
00:48:31,813 --> 00:48:33,804
Truck drivers.

550
00:49:11,613 --> 00:49:13,729
- Where you going?
- California.

551
00:49:13,813 --> 00:49:17,089
- How long you plan to be in Arizona?
- No longer than to get across.

552
00:49:17,173 --> 00:49:19,971
- Got any plants?
- No, no plants.

553
00:49:22,773 --> 00:49:26,049
- OK, go ahead, but keep moving.
- We aim to.

554
00:50:44,333 --> 00:50:49,248
Well, there she is, folks.
The land of milk and honey.

555
00:50:49,333 --> 00:50:51,324
California.

556
00:50:55,773 --> 00:50:58,241
Well, if that's what we came out here for...

557
00:50:58,333 --> 00:51:03,930
Connie, maybe it's nice on the other side.
Them picture postcards, they was real pretty.

558
00:51:04,013 --> 00:51:07,210
There, Grandma. There's California.

559
00:51:09,613 --> 00:51:11,604
<i>(spits)</i>

560
00:51:13,493 --> 00:51:16,963
Let's get going.
She don't look so tough to me, eh, John?

561
00:51:17,053 --> 00:51:19,044
Well, I don't know.

562
00:51:31,533 --> 00:51:33,524
- <i>(screams)</i>
- Hold on!

563
00:52:20,693 --> 00:52:25,164
- Ain't too cold, is she, Tom?
- No, it's fine when you get in, Pa.

564
00:52:25,253 --> 00:52:28,325
Come on, John. Let's give her a whirl.

565
00:52:38,453 --> 00:52:40,683
This is supposed to be good for you, John.

566
00:52:40,773 --> 00:52:44,846
- Come on, Pa, before she floats away.
- Here we come.

567
00:52:49,533 --> 00:52:52,252
- You people got a lot of nerve.
- What do you mean?

568
00:52:52,333 --> 00:52:55,723
- Crossing the desert in ajalopy like this.
- You been across?

569
00:52:55,813 --> 00:52:59,601
Sure, plenty.
But never in no wreck like that.

570
00:52:59,693 --> 00:53:02,127
If we break down,
maybe somebody'd give us a hand.

571
00:53:02,213 --> 00:53:05,888
Well, maybe, but I'd hate to be doing it.
Takes more nerve than I got.

572
00:53:05,973 --> 00:53:11,969
Don't take no nerve to do something, ain't
nothing else you can do. Hope she holds.

573
00:53:23,853 --> 00:53:25,650
Grandpa.

574
00:53:31,173 --> 00:53:33,767
I want Grandpa.

575
00:53:36,133 --> 00:53:39,205
I want... Grandpa.

576
00:53:40,173 --> 00:53:42,767
Don't you fret now.

577
00:53:43,333 --> 00:53:45,130
There.

578
00:53:46,053 --> 00:53:49,409
Don't you fret now, Grandma.

579
00:53:49,853 --> 00:53:51,969
- Everybody set back there?
- Yeah.

580
00:53:52,053 --> 00:53:54,089
Here we go.

581
00:53:54,173 --> 00:53:56,368
Thank you very much.

582
00:54:04,053 --> 00:54:08,490
- Holy Moses, what a hard-looking outfit.
- All them Okies is hard-looking.

583
00:54:08,573 --> 00:54:12,009
Boy, but I'd hate to hit that desert
in ajalopy like that.

584
00:54:12,093 --> 00:54:17,087
You and me got sense.
Them Okies got no sense and no feeling.

585
00:54:17,173 --> 00:54:21,212
They ain't human.
No human being would live the way they do.

586
00:54:21,293 --> 00:54:24,922
A human being couldn't stand
to be so miserable.

587
00:54:25,013 --> 00:54:28,005
Just don't know any better, I guess.

588
00:54:47,773 --> 00:54:52,051
What a place.
How would you like to walk across it?

589
00:54:52,133 --> 00:54:55,523
People done it. If they could, we could.

590
00:54:55,613 --> 00:54:58,002
Lots must have died, too.

591
00:54:58,933 --> 00:55:01,128
Well, we ain't out of it yet.

592
00:55:05,133 --> 00:55:08,569
- This here's the desert. We're right in it.
- I wish it was day.

593
00:55:08,653 --> 00:55:13,283
Tom said if it was day,
it'd cut the gizzard right out of you.

594
00:55:13,373 --> 00:55:16,331
I seen a picture once
and there was bones everywhere.

595
00:55:16,413 --> 00:55:20,850
- Man bones?
- Some, I guess. But mostly cow bones.

596
00:55:20,933 --> 00:55:24,721
I sure would like to see
some of them man bones.

597
00:55:29,293 --> 00:55:32,205
Grandpa. I want Grandpa.

598
00:55:32,293 --> 00:55:35,603
Yes. Now everything's going to be all right.

599
00:55:35,693 --> 00:55:41,370
We got to get across, Grandma.
The family's got to get across.

600
00:55:41,453 --> 00:55:43,444
There.

601
00:55:50,373 --> 00:55:55,322
Seems like we wasn't never doing
nothing but moving. I' tired.

602
00:55:55,413 --> 00:55:57,404
Women's always tired.

603
00:55:59,133 --> 00:56:02,330
You ain't... you ain't sorry, are you, honey?

604
00:56:02,413 --> 00:56:04,290
No, but...

605
00:56:04,373 --> 00:56:08,844
But you seen that advertisement
in the <i>Spicy Western Story</i> magazine.

606
00:56:08,933 --> 00:56:14,326
Don't pay nothing. Just send them
the coupon and you're a radio expert.

607
00:56:14,413 --> 00:56:16,688
Nice clean work.

608
00:56:16,773 --> 00:56:18,843
But we can still do it, honey.

609
00:56:18,933 --> 00:56:23,324
I ought to done it then,
not come on any trip like this.

610
00:56:45,453 --> 00:56:48,365
- What's this here?
- Agricultural inspection.

611
00:56:48,453 --> 00:56:51,331
We gotta go over your stuff.
Got any vegetables or seed?

612
00:56:51,413 --> 00:56:52,528
No.

613
00:56:52,613 --> 00:56:55,286
We gotta look over your stuff.
You gotta unload.

614
00:56:55,373 --> 00:56:58,331
Unload? Holy Moses.

615
00:57:08,053 --> 00:57:10,931
You'll have to get out
while we unload for inspection.

616
00:57:11,013 --> 00:57:16,610
We got a sick old lady. We got to get her to a
doctor. We can't wait. You can't make us wait.

617
00:57:16,693 --> 00:57:18,684
Yeah? Well, we gotta look you over.

618
00:57:18,773 --> 00:57:21,526
Well, I swear we ain't got anything. I swear it.

619
00:57:21,613 --> 00:57:23,843
Grandma's awful sick.

620
00:57:23,933 --> 00:57:25,924
Look.

621
00:57:29,453 --> 00:57:31,444
You wasn't fooling.

622
00:57:32,933 --> 00:57:36,721
- You swear you got no fruit or vegetables?
- No, I swear it.

623
00:57:36,813 --> 00:57:39,850
Go ahead. Get a doctor at Barstow.
That's just eight miles.

624
00:57:39,933 --> 00:57:41,924
But don't stop or get off. Understand?

625
00:57:42,013 --> 00:57:44,527
- OK, Cap. Much obliged.
- Thanks.

626
00:58:11,054 --> 00:58:13,363
Ma! Grandma! Look!

627
00:58:24,494 --> 00:58:29,807
There she is. There she is.
I never knowed there was anything like her.

628
00:58:29,894 --> 00:58:33,569
- Will you look at her.
- Look yonder, John.

629
00:58:33,654 --> 00:58:36,248
Look how purdy and green it is, Winfield.

630
00:58:36,334 --> 00:58:39,883
- Wonder if them's orange trees, John?
- Look like orange trees to me.

631
00:58:39,974 --> 00:58:42,727
- They sure are pretty, whatever they are.
- Indeed.

632
00:58:42,814 --> 00:58:46,966
Look at them haystacks. I bet we sure could
have fun playing over there.

633
00:58:47,054 --> 00:58:50,569
Pretty, ain't it? Mighty pretty. Tom.

634
00:58:50,654 --> 00:58:54,044
Where's Ma? I want Ma to see this.
Look, Ma. Come here, Ma.

635
00:58:54,134 --> 00:58:56,125
Come on. Come on.

636
00:58:58,374 --> 00:59:01,252
- You sick, Ma?
- You say we got across?

637
00:59:01,334 --> 00:59:03,086
Look.

638
00:59:03,174 --> 00:59:05,529
Oh, thank God.

639
00:59:05,614 --> 00:59:08,765
And we're still together. Most of us.

640
00:59:10,134 --> 00:59:12,170
Didn't you sleep none?

641
00:59:12,254 --> 00:59:15,052
- Was Grandma bad?
- Grandma's dead.

642
00:59:16,454 --> 00:59:18,126
When?

643
00:59:18,214 --> 00:59:23,607
- Since before they stopped us last night.
- That's why you didn't want them to look?

644
00:59:23,694 --> 00:59:28,165
I was afraid they'd stop us
and we wouldn't get across.

645
00:59:29,134 --> 00:59:31,568
I told Grandma.

646
00:59:31,654 --> 00:59:36,444
I told her when she was dying.
I told her the family had to get across.

647
00:59:36,534 --> 00:59:41,005
I told her we couldn't take no chance
on being stopped.

648
00:59:43,014 --> 00:59:45,005
So it's all right.

649
00:59:45,814 --> 00:59:51,446
She'll get buried where it's nice and green,
trees and flowers all around.

650
00:59:54,094 --> 00:59:58,884
She got to lay her head down
in California after all.

651
01:00:12,014 --> 01:00:13,163
Whoa.

652
01:00:13,254 --> 01:00:15,370

653
01:00:18,014 --> 01:00:21,086
How far you figure
you going to get that way, pushing?

654
01:00:21,174 --> 01:00:23,529
Right here. We run out of gas.

655
01:00:24,334 --> 01:00:28,566
Where's the best place to get work
around here? Don't matter what kind either.

656
01:00:28,654 --> 01:00:32,693
If I've seen one of them things,
I've seen 10,000 of 'em.

657
01:00:32,774 --> 01:00:36,005
- Why? Ain't it no good?
- Not here. Not now.

658
01:00:36,094 --> 01:00:40,292
There was some picking around here
about a month ago, but it's all moved south.

659
01:00:40,374 --> 01:00:43,332
- What part of Oklahoma you from, anyhow?
- Sallisaw.

660
01:00:43,414 --> 01:00:47,612
Sallisaw? I come out from Cherokee County
myself about two years ago.

661
01:00:47,694 --> 01:00:50,128
- Cherokee County! Gee!
- Oh, boy!

662
01:00:50,934 --> 01:00:55,291
- Connie's folks are from Cherokee County.
- You don't say!

663
01:00:55,374 --> 01:00:58,889
All right, all right. Let's don't go into it.

664
01:00:58,974 --> 01:01:04,367
What I gotta tell you is this: don't try to park
in town tonight. Just go on out to that camp.

665
01:01:04,454 --> 01:01:06,922
If I catch you in town after dark
I gotta lock you up.

666
01:01:07,014 --> 01:01:11,212
- But what are we gonna do?
- Well, pop, thatjust ain't up to me.

667
01:01:11,294 --> 01:01:17,005
I don't mind telling you the guy they ought to
lock up is the guy that sent them things out.

668
01:01:20,494 --> 01:01:22,610
How many, folks?

669
01:01:22,694 --> 01:01:24,491
One.

670
01:02:48,134 --> 01:02:51,604
Sure don't look none too prosperous.

671
01:02:51,694 --> 01:02:55,323
- Wanna go somewhere else?
- On a gallon of gas?

672
01:02:55,414 --> 01:02:59,009
Let's set up the tent
and maybe I can fix some stew.

673
01:03:22,654 --> 01:03:26,329
I could break up some brush
if you want me, ma'am.

674
01:03:26,414 --> 01:03:29,770
- You wanna be asked to eat, don't you?
- Yes, ma'am.

675
01:03:29,854 --> 01:03:33,813
- Didn't you have no breakfast?
- No, ma'am. They ain't no work hereabouts.

676
01:03:33,894 --> 01:03:38,046
Pa's been trying to sell some stuff
to get gas, so as we can get along.

677
01:03:38,134 --> 01:03:41,729
Didn't none of these have no breakfast?

678
01:03:41,814 --> 01:03:46,012
I did. Me and my brother did.
We ate good.

679
01:03:46,094 --> 01:03:50,292
- Well, you ain't hungry then, are you?
- We ate good.

680
01:03:50,374 --> 01:03:54,162
I' glad some of you ain't hungry.
There won't be enough to go all around.

Aw, he was braggin' Know what he done?

682
01:03:56,814 --> 01:03:59,567
Last night, come out
and say they got chicken to eat.

683
01:03:59,654 --> 01:04:05,411
Well, I looked in whilst they was eating and
it was fried dough, just like everybody else.

684
01:04:05,494 --> 01:04:07,564
Ma? How about it?

685
01:04:07,654 --> 01:04:11,169
Well, I don't know what to do.
I've got to feed the family...

686
01:04:11,254 --> 01:04:14,451
What am I gonna do about all these here?

687
01:04:20,734 --> 01:04:23,123
Give this to Ruthie.

688
01:04:29,174 --> 01:04:31,563
There you are, John.

689
01:04:41,014 --> 01:04:43,812
Here, Tom. You take it. I ain't hungry.

690
01:04:43,894 --> 01:04:48,046
- What do you mean? You ain't ate today.
- I know, but I got a stomachache.

691
01:04:48,134 --> 01:04:50,364
I ain't hungry.

692
01:04:50,454 --> 01:04:56,450
- Take that plate in the tent and you eat it.
- It wouldn't be no use. I'd still see them.

693
01:04:58,214 --> 01:05:00,489
You get! Go on now. Get!

694
01:05:00,574 --> 01:05:05,728
You ain't doing no good.
There ain't enough for you anyway.

695
01:05:05,814 --> 01:05:08,009
Go on... now.

696
01:05:19,894 --> 01:05:22,124
You can't send them away.

697
01:05:22,214 --> 01:05:25,490
Here. Take your plates and go inside.

698
01:05:26,294 --> 01:05:30,765
Now look, all you little fellas.
You each go and get you a nice flat stick

699

700
01:05:33,694 --> 01:05:35,685
Now get.

701
01:05:40,014 --> 01:05:43,609
I don't know whether I' doing right or not.

702
01:05:44,574 --> 01:05:49,329
Get inside! Get inside, everybody,
and stay inside!

703
01:05:49,414 --> 01:05:53,089
Lady's gonna feed us. Get yourself a tin can.

01:06:06,054 --> 01:06:09,842

Sure we wanna work. Where's it at?

709
01:06:36,814 --> 01:06:40,090
Tovaris County. Fruit's opening up.
Need a lot of fruit pickers.

710
01:06:40,174 --> 01:06:44,087
- You doing the hiring?
- Well, I' contracting the land.

711
01:06:44,174 --> 01:06:49,726
- What you paying?
- Well, can't tell exactly yet. 30 cents, I guess.

712
01:06:49,814 --> 01:06:52,886
Why can't you tell?
You took the contract, didn't you?

713
01:06:52,974 --> 01:06:55,044
That's true, but it's keyed to the price.

714
01:06:55,134 --> 01:06:58,285
Might be a little more, might be a little less.

715
01:06:58,374 --> 01:07:00,888
All right, mister. I'll go.

716
01:07:00,974 --> 01:07:04,364
Just show us your licence to contract.
Then you make out an order.

717
01:07:04,454 --> 01:07:07,890
Where, when and how much you're
gonna pay. You sign it and we'll go.

718
01:07:07,974 --> 01:07:10,886
Now listen, smart guy.
I'll run my business my own way.

719
01:07:10,974 --> 01:07:16,446
I got work. If you want to take it, OK.
If not, just sit here, that's all.

720
01:07:17,134 --> 01:07:19,728
Twice now I've fell for that line.

721
01:07:19,814 --> 01:07:25,252
Maybe he needs 1,000 men. So he gets
5,000 there and he'll pay 15 cents an hour.

722
01:07:25,334 --> 01:07:28,167
You guys will have to take it
because you'll be hungry.

723
01:07:28,254 --> 01:07:31,644
If he wants to hire, let him write it out
and say what he's gonna pay.

724
01:07:31,734 --> 01:07:35,443
Ask to see his licence. He ain't allowed
to contract men without a licence.

725
01:07:35,534 --> 01:07:37,650
Hey, Joe.

726
01:07:37,734 --> 01:07:39,725

- Ever see this guy before?
- Seems like I have.

728
01:07:49,014 --> 01:07:53,405

a used-car lot that was busted into.

- Open your trap again and you'll go too.

better all pack and come to Tovaris County.

- Why, the sheriff, he seen you, Tom.

You wanna be sent back for breaking parole?

Then he started shooting.
Hit that woman there, so I hit him again.

01:16:23,774 --> 01:16:26,607
- What is it? A wreck?
- Where do you think you're going?

805
01:16:26,694 --> 01:16:29,686
Fella named Spencer sent us.
Said there was work.

806
01:16:29,774 --> 01:16:32,242
- Oh, you wanna work, huh?
- Sure do.

807
01:16:32,334 --> 01:16:35,053
All right. Just pull up in line there.

808
01:16:35,134 --> 01:16:38,968
- OK for this one. Take 'em through.
- What's the matter? What happened?

809
01:16:39,054 --> 01:16:44,333
Oh, a little trouble up there,
but you'll get through all right.

810
01:16:47,534 --> 01:16:49,525
Go ahead.

811
01:16:58,774 --> 01:17:00,890
What do you think it is? A washout?

812
01:17:00,974 --> 01:17:05,092
I don't know what these cops
have got to do with it, but I don't like it.

813
01:17:05,174 --> 01:17:09,645
These are our own people too.
All of them. I don't like this.

814
01:17:09,734 --> 01:17:12,328
Get going. Stay in line.

815
01:17:13,494 --> 01:17:15,485
Go ahead.

816
01:17:18,934 --> 01:17:21,846
What are you gonna do, scab?

817
01:18:03,374 --> 01:18:05,365
Go on. Hurry up.

818
01:18:07,294 --> 01:18:09,888
Come on, come on, come on.

819
01:18:09,974 --> 01:18:12,010
Go on up there.

820
01:18:12,774 --> 01:18:14,765
Up the street there.

821
01:18:17,414 --> 01:18:19,803
Keep in line, up the street.

822
01:18:38,134 --> 01:18:40,125
Hold it, bud.

823
01:18:43,574 --> 01:18:46,134
- Wanna work?
- Sure, but what is this?

824
01:18:46,214 --> 01:18:49,490
- None of your business. Name?
- Joad.

825
01:18:49,574 --> 01:18:51,804
- How many men?
- Four.

826
01:18:51,894 --> 01:18:54,772
- Women?
- Two.

827
01:18:54,854 --> 01:18:56,731
- Kids?
- Two.

828
01:18:56,814 --> 01:18:59,009
Can you all work?

829
01:18:59,094 --> 01:19:02,166
- Sure, I guess so.
- OK. House 63.

830
01:19:02,254 --> 01:19:05,724
Wages, five cents a box. No bruised fruit.

831
01:19:05,814 --> 01:19:08,886
Move along. You go to work right away.

832
01:19:33,654 --> 01:19:35,645
Come on, honey.

833
01:19:38,254 --> 01:19:40,814
- Name?
- Joad.

834
01:19:40,894 --> 01:19:43,044
Say, what is all this here?

835
01:19:43,134 --> 01:19:45,853
- Joad. Not here.
- Licence?

836
01:19:45,934 --> 01:19:48,653
Oklahoma EL204.

837
01:19:48,734 --> 01:19:50,406
Don't check.

838
01:19:50,494 --> 01:19:53,531
Now, you look here.
We don't want no trouble with you.

839
01:19:53,614 --> 01:19:59,610
Just do your own work and mind
your business and you'll be all right.

840
01:19:59,694 --> 01:20:03,767
Sure do wanna make you
feel at home here all right.

841
01:20:10,014 --> 01:20:12,209
- We going to live here, Ma?
- Why, sure.

842
01:20:12,294 --> 01:20:15,809
This won't be so bad
once we get her washed out.

843
01:20:15,894 --> 01:20:18,124
I liked the tent better.

844
01:20:18,214 --> 01:20:20,682
This has got a floor.

845
01:20:20,774 --> 01:20:23,572
Won't leak when it rains.

846
01:20:24,774 --> 01:20:27,572
Here. This might come in handy.

847
01:20:32,054 --> 01:20:34,204
- Name?
- Still Joad.

848
01:20:34,294 --> 01:20:36,091
- How many?
- Six. You all go on.

849
01:20:36,174 --> 01:20:39,450
Rosasharn and me will unload the truck.

850
01:21:25,374 --> 01:21:28,411
- Any more of them hamburgers, Ma?
- No, there ain't.

851
01:21:28,494 --> 01:21:32,328
- You made a dollar. That's a dollar's worth.
- Dollar's worth? That?

852
01:21:32,414 --> 01:21:35,963
They charge extra at that company store
and there ain't no other place.

853
01:21:36,054 --> 01:21:38,170
Well, I ain't full.

854
01:21:38,254 --> 01:21:44,966
Tomorrow you'll get in a full day's work and a
full day's pay and then we'll all have enough.

855
01:21:45,054 --> 01:21:50,208
You wouldn't thinkjust reaching up
and picking would get you in the back.

856
01:21:50,294 --> 01:21:54,003
Think I'll walk out and find out
what all that fuss outside the gate was.

857
01:21:54,094 --> 01:21:58,087
- Anybody come with me?
- No, I think I'll set awhile, then go to bed.

858
01:21:58,174 --> 01:22:01,530
Think I'll look around
and see if I can't meet me a girl.

859
01:22:01,614 --> 01:22:03,844
- Say, when I was your age, I...
- Pa!

860
01:22:03,934 --> 01:22:08,166
Working on me what all that yelling
was about. Got me all curious.

861
01:22:08,254 --> 01:22:10,722
I'll be back in a little while.

862
01:22:12,574 --> 01:22:16,886
Tom. Now, you be careful.
Don't you go sticking your nose in anything.

863
01:22:16,974 --> 01:22:19,169
OK, Ma. Don't worry.

864
01:22:29,854 --> 01:22:32,368
Where do you think you're going?

865
01:22:32,454 --> 01:22:34,570
Thought I'd take a walk.

866
01:22:34,654 --> 01:22:38,806
- Is there any law against that?
- You can just turn around and walk back.

867
01:22:38,894 --> 01:22:42,330
- You mean I can't even get out of here?
- Not tonight you can't.

868
01:22:42,414 --> 01:22:48,410
Do you want to walk back? Or shall I whistle
up some help and have you taken back?

869
01:22:50,694 --> 01:22:53,288
I'll walk back.

870
01:23:37,334 --> 01:23:39,325
- Evening.
- Who are you?

871
01:23:39,414 --> 01:23:41,974
- Just going past.
- Know anybody around here?

872
01:23:42,054 --> 01:23:44,648
No. Just going past, I tell you.

873
01:23:47,774 --> 01:23:51,244
- Casy!
- Well, if it ain't Tom Joad. Hiya, boy.

874
01:23:52,094 --> 01:23:55,848
- I thought you was in jail.
- No. They just run me out of town.

875
01:23:55,934 --> 01:23:58,732
Come on in. Tom Joad.

876
01:24:00,454 --> 01:24:04,049
- This the fella you been talking about?
- That's him. What are you doing?

877
01:24:04,134 --> 01:24:06,284
Working, picking peaches.

878
01:24:06,374 --> 01:24:10,083
I heard fellas shouting when we come in.
I came to find out what's going on.

879
01:24:10,174 --> 01:24:13,610
- What's it about?
- This here's a strike.

880
01:24:13,694 --> 01:24:16,128
Five cents a box ain't much,
but a fella can eat.

881
01:24:16,214 --> 01:24:20,685
- Five cents? They paying you five cents?
- Sure. We made a buck since midday.

882
01:24:20,774 --> 01:24:23,925
Looky, Tom. We come here to work.

883
01:24:24,014 --> 01:24:27,689
They tell us it's gonna be five cents,
but there's a whole lot of us.

884
01:24:27,774 --> 01:24:30,447
So the man says two and a half cents.

885
01:24:31,254 --> 01:24:35,133
A fella can't even eat on that
and if he's got kids...

886
01:24:35,214 --> 01:24:37,205
So we says we won't take it.

887
01:24:37,294 --> 01:24:40,445
So they drive us off.
Now they're paying you five cents.

888
01:24:40,534 --> 01:24:43,367
If they bust this strike,
you think they'll pay five?

889
01:24:43,454 --> 01:24:45,445
Dunno. Paying five now.

890
01:24:45,534 --> 01:24:48,685
They'll get two and a half cents
just the minute we're gone.

891
01:24:48,774 --> 01:24:50,810
You know what that is.

892
01:24:50,894 --> 01:24:54,853
One ton of peaches,
picked and carried for a dollar.

893
01:24:54,934 --> 01:24:58,563
That way you can't even
buy enough food to keep you alive.

894
01:24:58,654 --> 01:25:02,533
Tell 'em to come out with us, Tom.
Them peaches is ripe.

895
01:25:02,614 --> 01:25:07,165
Two days out and they'll pay us all five.
Maybe seven.

896
01:25:08,294 --> 01:25:11,684
They won't. They're getting five now.
That's all they care about.

897
01:25:11,774 --> 01:25:15,050
But the moment they ain't strike-breaking,
they won't get no five.

898
01:25:15,134 --> 01:25:19,093
Next thing you know you'll be out.
They got it all fixed down to a T.

899
01:25:19,174 --> 01:25:22,883
Soon as the harvest is in you're
a migrant worker. Afterwards, just a bum.

900
01:25:22,974 --> 01:25:26,489
Five they're getting now.
That's all they're interested in.

901
01:25:26,574 --> 01:25:29,646
I know what Pa would say.
He'd say it's none of his business.

902
01:25:29,734 --> 01:25:32,806
That's right.
He'll have to take a beating before he'll know.

903
01:25:32,894 --> 01:25:35,727
Take a beating? We was out of food.

904
01:25:35,814 --> 01:25:39,011
Tonight we had meat -
not much, but we had it.

905
01:25:39,094 --> 01:25:43,406
You think Pa's gonna give up his meat
on account of some other fellas?

906
01:25:43,494 --> 01:25:45,724
Rosasharn needs milk.

907
01:25:45,814 --> 01:25:50,490
You think Ma's gonna starve that baby just
on account of fellas yelling outside a gate?

908
01:25:50,574 --> 01:25:53,452
Tom, you gotta learn like I' learning.

909
01:25:53,534 --> 01:25:57,447
I don't know what's right yet myself,
but I' trying to find out.

910
01:25:57,534 --> 01:26:00,765
That's why I can't ever be a preacher again.

911
01:26:00,854 --> 01:26:02,970
Preacher's got to know.

912
01:26:03,054 --> 01:26:05,443
I don't know.

913
01:26:05,534 --> 01:26:07,286
I got to ask.

914
01:26:07,374 --> 01:26:09,444
- I don't like it.
- What's the matter?

915
01:26:09,534 --> 01:26:14,813
I can't tell. Seems as though I hear something
and when I listen there ain't nothing to hear.

916
01:26:14,894 --> 01:26:18,250
- It ain't out of the question, you know.
- We're all a little itchy.

917
01:26:18,334 --> 01:26:21,565
Cops been telling us
how they gonna beat us up and run us out.

918
01:26:21,654 --> 01:26:26,603
Not them regular deputies, but them
tin-seal men. The ones they got for guards.

919
01:26:26,694 --> 01:26:29,447
They figure I' the leader
cos I talk so much.

920
01:26:29,534 --> 01:26:34,403
Turn out the light. Come outside.
There's something here.

921
01:26:38,494 --> 01:26:41,691
- What is it?
- I don't know. Listen.

922
01:26:41,774 --> 01:26:45,289
- Can't tell whether you hear it or not.
- You hear it, Tom?

923
01:26:45,374 --> 01:26:49,890
I hear it. I think there's some guys
coming this way. A lot of 'em.

924
01:26:49,974 --> 01:26:55,253
- We gotta get outta here.
- Down that way! Under the bridge span.

925
01:27:14,174 --> 01:27:18,531
<i>(man)</i> There he is! The one in the middle.
The skinny one. Chuck! Alec! Get him!

926
01:27:22,294 --> 01:27:25,252
You don't know what you're doing!
You're helping starve kids.

927
01:27:25,334 --> 01:27:27,723
- Aw, shut up, you dirty...
- Casy!

928
01:27:28,854 --> 01:27:31,926
- You've killed him!
- Serves him right too.

929
01:27:32,014 --> 01:27:34,005
Look out!

930
01:27:42,254 --> 01:27:45,963
- Boy, he's dead. He's good and dead.
- Did you see the fella that done it?

931
01:27:46,054 --> 01:27:51,731
I ain't sure, but I caught him across the face,
a trademark he won't get rid of in a hurry.

932
01:27:59,574 --> 01:28:01,565
<i>(siren)</i>

933
01:28:04,454 --> 01:28:05,853
Ma?

934
01:28:05,934 --> 01:28:09,210
Tom! Tom! Pa, wake up. Al, get the light.

935
01:28:09,294 --> 01:28:11,091
Shh!

936
01:28:14,934 --> 01:28:16,925
Come on.

937
01:28:39,494 --> 01:28:41,485
<i>(dog barking)</i>

938
01:28:48,454 --> 01:28:50,445
<i>(cock crows)</i>

939
01:29:06,654 --> 01:29:09,043
- Anybody ask anything?
- No, ma'am.

940
01:29:09,134 --> 01:29:12,604
- Well, you stay by that door.
- Yes, ma'am.

941
01:29:14,334 --> 01:29:16,131
Tommy?

942
01:29:17,254 --> 01:29:19,245
How's it feel?

943
01:29:21,214 --> 01:29:24,206
Busted my cheek, but I can still see.

944
01:29:26,414 --> 01:29:29,645
- What did you hear?
- Looks like you've done it.

945
01:29:31,374 --> 01:29:34,047
I thought so. Felt like it.

946
01:29:35,854 --> 01:29:38,607
Folks ain't talking about much else.

947
01:29:38,694 --> 01:29:41,254
They say they got posses out.

948
01:29:41,334 --> 01:29:44,371
Talking about a lynching
when they catch the fella.

949
01:29:44,454 --> 01:29:46,649
They killed Casy first.

950
01:29:46,734 --> 01:29:51,012
That ain't the way they're telling it.
They're saying you done it first.

951
01:29:51,094 --> 01:29:53,324
Do they know...

952
01:29:53,414 --> 01:29:55,848
what the fellow looks like?

953
01:29:55,934 --> 01:29:58,732
They know he got hit in the face.

954
01:30:01,214 --> 01:30:03,409
I' sorry, Ma.

955
01:30:03,494 --> 01:30:07,089
I didn't know what I was doing
any more than when you take a breath.

956
01:30:07,174 --> 01:30:10,325
I didn't even know I was going to do it.

957
01:30:10,414 --> 01:30:13,008
Oh, it's all right, Tommy.

958
01:30:14,974 --> 01:30:17,534
I wished you didn't do it.

959
01:30:17,614 --> 01:30:20,208
But you done what you had to do.

960
01:30:20,294 --> 01:30:22,933
And I can't read no fault in you.

961
01:30:27,014 --> 01:30:29,687
I' going away tonight.
I can't go putting this on you.

962
01:30:29,774 --> 01:30:31,412
Tom.

963
01:30:31,494 --> 01:30:34,611
There's a whole lot I don't understand.

964
01:30:34,694 --> 01:30:37,766
But going away ain't going to ease us.

965
01:30:39,574 --> 01:30:42,532
There was a time we was on the land.

966
01:30:42,614 --> 01:30:45,367
There was a boundary to us then.

967
01:30:46,054 --> 01:30:49,490
Old folks died off and little fellas come...

968
01:30:49,574 --> 01:30:52,486
We was always one thing.

969
01:30:52,574 --> 01:30:54,644
We was the family.

970
01:30:55,454 --> 01:30:57,968
Kind of whole and clear.

971
01:30:58,774 --> 01:31:01,652
But now we ain't clear no more.

972
01:31:01,734 --> 01:31:04,885
They ain't nothing that keeps us clear.

973
01:31:04,974 --> 01:31:08,603
Al, he's hankering and gibbeting
to be off on his own.

974
01:31:08,694 --> 01:31:11,606
Uncle John's just dragging around.

975
01:31:12,414 --> 01:31:16,612
Your pa's lost his place.
He ain't the head no more.

976
01:31:17,854 --> 01:31:20,243
We're cracking up, Tom.

977
01:31:21,374 --> 01:31:23,763
There ain't no family now.

978
01:31:27,174 --> 01:31:32,771
And Rosasharn, she's gonna have her baby,
but it won't have no family.

979
01:31:32,854 --> 01:31:35,846
I been trying to keep her going, but...

980
01:31:35,934 --> 01:31:37,925
<i>(sighs)</i>

981
01:31:38,014 --> 01:31:40,164
And Winfield.

982
01:31:40,254 --> 01:31:42,814
What's he gonna be this way?

983
01:31:42,894 --> 01:31:46,648
Growing up wild, and Ruthie too.

984
01:31:47,494 --> 01:31:49,485
Just like animals.

985
01:31:51,814 --> 01:31:54,408
Got nothing to trust.

986
01:31:57,494 --> 01:31:59,485
Don't go, Tom.

987
01:32:00,614 --> 01:32:02,605
Stay and help.

988
01:32:03,614 --> 01:32:05,969
Help me.

989
01:32:10,654 --> 01:32:15,170
OK, Ma. I shouldn't,
I know I shouldn't, but OK.

990
01:32:15,254 --> 01:32:17,245
<i>(vehicle approaches)</i>

991
01:32:18,374 --> 01:32:21,286
Ma, here come a lot of people.

992
01:32:21,374 --> 01:32:23,604
- <i>(man)</i> How many?
- Ten of us.

993
01:32:23,694 --> 01:32:25,844
House 25. The number's on the door.

994
01:32:25,934 --> 01:32:29,847
- OK, mister. What you paying?
- Two and a half cents.

995
01:32:29,934 --> 01:32:33,847
Two and a half? Say, mister,
a man can't make his dinner on that.

996
01:32:33,934 --> 01:32:38,007
Take it or leave it. There are 200 men coming
in from the South will be glad to get it.

997
01:32:38,094 --> 01:32:40,767
- But how are we gonna eat?
- Look...

998
01:32:40,854 --> 01:32:45,450
I didn't set the price. If you want it, OK.
If you don't, turn around and beat it.

999
01:32:45,534 --> 01:32:49,322
- Which way to house 25?
- Straight up the street.

1000
01:32:57,654 --> 01:32:59,770
That Casy.

1001
01:32:59,854 --> 01:33:04,052
He might have been a preacher,
but he seen things clear.

1002
01:33:04,134 --> 01:33:06,125
He was like a lantern.

1003
01:33:06,214 --> 01:33:08,603
He helped me to see things too.

1004
01:33:08,694 --> 01:33:11,686
Comes night, we'll get out of here.

1005
01:33:13,494 --> 01:33:15,485
Like a lantern.

1006
01:33:19,814 --> 01:33:22,203
- <i>(whispers)</i> I'll start the car.
- Yes.

1007
01:33:32,654 --> 01:33:34,645
All right, Tom.

1008
01:33:36,854 --> 01:33:38,845
Jump up. Jump up.

1009
01:33:42,414 --> 01:33:44,848
Just till we get distance.
Then you can come out.

1010
01:33:44,934 --> 01:33:47,448
I'd hate to get trapped in here.

1011
01:33:47,534 --> 01:33:49,525
Get in, Ma.

1012
01:33:51,974 --> 01:33:54,932
- <i>(man)</i> Hey! Where you going?
- We're going out.

1013
01:33:55,014 --> 01:33:57,972
- What for?
- We got ajob offered. A good job.

1014
01:33:58,054 --> 01:33:59,248
Yeah?

1015
01:33:59,334 --> 01:34:01,802
Well, let's take a look at you.

1016
01:34:19,254 --> 01:34:22,564
- Wasn't there another fella with you?
- You mean that hitchhiker?

1017
01:34:22,654 --> 01:34:26,442
- Little short fella with a pale face?
- I guess that's what he looked like.

1018
01:34:26,534 --> 01:34:29,173
We just picked him up on the way in.

1019
01:34:29,254 --> 01:34:33,008
- He left when the rate dropped.
- What did you say he looked like again?

1020
01:34:33,094 --> 01:34:35,324
Short fella. Pale face.

1021
01:34:35,414 --> 01:34:37,644
Was he bruised about the face this morning?

1022
01:34:37,734 --> 01:34:39,725
I didn't see nothing.

1023
01:34:39,814 --> 01:34:42,203
OK, go on.

1024
01:35:00,534 --> 01:35:05,130
- Going out for good?
- Yeah. Going north. Got ajob.

1025
01:35:07,094 --> 01:35:08,891
OK.

1026
01:35:18,574 --> 01:35:22,328
- Done good, Al. You done real good.
- Know where we're going?

1027
01:35:22,414 --> 01:35:28,410
It don't matter. We got to go and keep going
till we get plenty of distance away from here.

1028
01:35:43,374 --> 01:35:45,888
Ouch! She's hotter than a heifer.

1029
01:35:45,974 --> 01:35:48,090
- What's up?
- The fan belt's shot.

1030
01:35:48,174 --> 01:35:51,246
Sure picked a nice place for it too, didn't she?

1031
01:35:51,334 --> 01:35:54,565
- Got any gas?
- About half a gallon.

1032
01:35:54,654 --> 01:35:57,214
Well, Ma, sure looks like
we done her this time.

1033
01:35:57,294 --> 01:36:00,206
Lights up ahead.
That might be a camp or something.

1034
01:36:00,294 --> 01:36:03,491
Looks like about a mile.
Reckon she'll coast her, Al?

1035
01:36:03,574 --> 01:36:06,611
- Got to coast it.
- Well, let's give her a whirl. Huh?

1036
01:36:06,694 --> 01:36:08,969
Come on, kids. Get in. John!

1037
01:36:44,694 --> 01:36:46,889
Did you hurt yourself, John?

1038
01:36:46,974 --> 01:36:48,771
No.

1039
01:36:50,174 --> 01:36:53,211
- You hit it too fast.
- What's the idea of that?

1040
01:36:53,294 --> 01:36:56,013
Well, you see a lot of children play in here.

1041
01:36:56,094 --> 01:36:59,325
You can tell people to drive slow
and they're liable to forget,

1042
01:36:59,414 --> 01:37:01,803
but once they hit that hump
they don't forget.

1043
01:37:01,894 --> 01:37:04,283
- Got any room here for us?
- You're lucky.

1044
01:37:04,374 --> 01:37:06,888
How do you do, ma'am? How are you?

1045
01:37:06,974 --> 01:37:09,044
How are you?

1046
01:37:09,134 --> 01:37:14,208
Down that line, turn to the left. You'll see it.
You'll be in number four sanitary unit.

1047
01:37:14,294 --> 01:37:17,969
- What's that?
- Toilet, showers, washtubs.

1048
01:37:18,974 --> 01:37:21,249
We'll have washtubs with running water?

1049
01:37:21,334 --> 01:37:23,006
Yes, ma'am.

1050
01:37:23,094 --> 01:37:26,370
Camp committee will call on you
in the morning, get you fixed.

1051
01:37:26,454 --> 01:37:29,287
- Cops?
- No. No cops.

1052
01:37:29,374 --> 01:37:33,652
No, people here elect their own cops.
The ladies' committee'll call on you, ma'am.

1053
01:37:33,734 --> 01:37:39,172
Tell you about the children, the schools
and sanitary unit and who takes care of 'em.

1054
01:37:39,254 --> 01:37:42,052
Will you come inside and sign up?

1055
01:37:52,534 --> 01:37:55,367
Drive her on down, Al. I'll sign up.

1056
01:37:55,454 --> 01:37:58,252
Right this way. In here.

1057
01:38:06,334 --> 01:38:09,326
Now, I don't want to seem inquisitive,
you understand,

1058
01:38:09,414 --> 01:38:14,647
but there's certain information
I have to have. What's your name?

1059
01:38:14,734 --> 01:38:17,123
Joad. Tom Joad.

1060
01:38:17,214 --> 01:38:19,808
- J-O...
- A-D.

1061
01:38:21,374 --> 01:38:23,649
And how many of you?

1062
01:38:24,454 --> 01:38:26,445
Eight. Now.

1063
01:38:28,854 --> 01:38:33,166
- Uncle John, you don't look so good.
- I ain't so good, but I' coming.

1064
01:38:33,254 --> 01:38:35,245
Come on.

1065
01:38:36,094 --> 01:38:37,322
Shove.

1066
01:38:37,414 --> 01:38:39,928
Camp site costs a dollar a week.
You can work that out

1067
01:38:40,014 --> 01:38:43,893
carrying garbage, keeping
the camp clean, things like that.

1068
01:38:43,974 --> 01:38:45,965
We'll work it out.

1069
01:38:46,054 --> 01:38:48,852
What's the committee you're talking about?

1070
01:38:48,934 --> 01:38:53,769
We have five sanitary units.
Each one elects a central committee man.

1071
01:38:53,854 --> 01:38:56,243
They make the laws and what they say goes.

1072
01:38:56,334 --> 01:39:01,806
You aiming to tell me the fellas running
the camp are just fellas camping here?

1073
01:39:01,894 --> 01:39:05,728
- That's the way it is.
- And you say no cops?

1074
01:39:05,814 --> 01:39:08,772
No cop can come in here without a warrant.

1075
01:39:08,854 --> 01:39:11,322
I can't hardly believe it.

1076
01:39:11,414 --> 01:39:16,169
Camp I was in before, they burnt it out.
Deputies and some of them pool-room fellas.

1077
01:39:16,254 --> 01:39:20,008
They don't get in here.
Sometimes the boys patrol the fences.

1078
01:39:20,094 --> 01:39:23,643
- Especially on dance nights.
- You got dances too?

1079
01:39:23,734 --> 01:39:26,965
We have the best dances in the county,
every Saturday night.

1080
01:39:27,054 --> 01:39:29,727
- Who runs this place?
- The government.

1081
01:39:29,814 --> 01:39:34,092
- Why ain't there more like it?
- You find out. I can't.

1082
01:39:35,694 --> 01:39:38,083
Is there anything like work around here?

1083
01:39:38,174 --> 01:39:43,373
I can't promise you that, but there'll be
a licensed agent here later if you want to talk.

1084
01:39:43,454 --> 01:39:46,287
That cut you have?

1085
01:39:46,374 --> 01:39:48,968
- Crate fell on me.
- You'd better take care of it.

1086
01:39:49,054 --> 01:39:53,809
Store manager will give you something for it.
See you later.

1087
01:39:53,894 --> 01:39:56,169
Ma's sure going to like it here.

1088
01:39:56,254 --> 01:39:59,291
She ain't been treated decent for...

1089
01:39:59,374 --> 01:40:01,365
a long while.

1090
01:40:02,854 --> 01:40:05,493

- What's the matter?

01:40:47,974 --> 01:40:52,809
It's some white things made out of dish stuff,
like in the catalogues. Come on, I'll show you.

- I reckon you stand in them little rooms.

up there. You take a bath.

Nice job.

1105

Listen here. Maybe I' going to talk myself
out of my farm, but I like you fellas.

1106

You're good workers. So I' going to tell you.

- You live over in the government camp?
- Yes, sir.

- You have dances there every Saturday night.
- We sure do.

1109
01:42:12,734 --> 01:42:16,283
- Well, look out next Saturday night.
- What's the matter?

1110
01:42:16,374 --> 01:42:18,842
I' head to the central committee.
I got to know.

1111
01:42:18,934 --> 01:42:21,892
Well, don't tell I told you.

01:42:32,254 --> 01:42:35,166
Listen. What is these reds anyway?

1116
01:42:35,254 --> 01:42:38,883
Every time you turn around
somebody's calling somebody else a red.

1117
01:42:38,974 --> 01:42:43,172
- What is these reds anyway?
- I ain't talking about that, one way or another.

a fight at the camp, Saturday night.

Maybe I've talked myself into trouble,
but you're folks like us and I like you.

01:43:25,334 --> 01:43:27,973
Hi, Miz Jennings. How are you?
Glad to see you.

1128
01:43:44,414 --> 01:43:46,245
- Hello.
- Hello.

1129
01:43:46,334 --> 01:43:50,885
- Going to the dance tonight? I can waltz.
- Oh, that's nothing. Anybody can waltz.

1130
01:43:50,974 --> 01:43:53,727
- Not like me they can't.
- You get going!

1131
01:43:53,814 --> 01:43:59,810
This girl's spoke for. She's gonna be married
and her man's coming for her. So get!

1132
01:44:05,454 --> 01:44:08,093
Hiya, Bill. Nice-looking girl you got there.

1133
01:44:08,174 --> 01:44:11,405
- Howdy, Mr Thomas, Mrs Thomas.
- Watching out, ain't you?

1134
01:44:11,494 --> 01:44:16,614
- Don't worry. There ain't gonna be no trouble.
- I hope you know what you're talking about.

1135
01:44:16,694 --> 01:44:19,731
<i>Evenin',</i> boys.
Who did you say invited you?

1136
01:44:19,814 --> 01:44:23,363
Fella named Jackson. Buck Jackson.

1137
01:44:23,454 --> 01:44:26,730
- OK. Have a good time.
- Thanks.

1138
01:44:33,774 --> 01:44:35,287
Hey.

1139
01:44:35,374 --> 01:44:38,411
- Them's our fellas.
- How do you know?

1140
01:44:38,494 --> 01:44:40,086
Well...

1141
01:44:40,174 --> 01:44:42,483
Just got a feeling.

1142
01:44:42,574 --> 01:44:45,247
They're kind of scared too.

1143
01:44:45,334 --> 01:44:50,328
Follow 'em. Get hold of Jackson.
See if he knows them. I'll stay here.

1144
01:44:52,494 --> 01:44:55,213
- Hello.
- Hello.

1145
01:44:55,294 --> 01:44:57,285
So long.

1146
01:45:01,294 --> 01:45:03,569
How do you do, Miz Joad?

1147
01:45:03,654 --> 01:45:06,043
My, you sure look pretty.

1148
01:45:14,854 --> 01:45:17,891
- Please to dance?
- Thank you kindly, but she ain't well.

1149
01:45:17,974 --> 01:45:21,364
- Sort of poorly.
- Thank you just the same.

1150
01:45:22,974 --> 01:45:24,965
Howdy do.

1151
01:45:32,014 --> 01:45:33,732
Hey, Jackson.

1152
01:45:33,814 --> 01:45:36,726
Look. Did you ever see them fellas before?

1153
01:45:41,814 --> 01:45:46,410
Sorry, neighbour,
but we got to keep the camp clean.

1154
01:45:47,654 --> 01:45:51,772
I know one of 'em. Used to work with him.
I never asked him to the dance though.

1155
01:45:51,854 --> 01:45:56,405
All right. Keep your eye on 'em.
Just keep 'em in sight, that's all.

1156
01:46:03,534 --> 01:46:07,049
I seen them. A car with five men
parked down by the eucalyptus trees.

1157
01:46:07,134 --> 01:46:10,843
And another with four men on the main
road, and they got guns. I seen 'em.

1158
01:46:10,934 --> 01:46:16,247
Thank you, Willy. You done right good.
You can run along and dance now.

1159
01:46:16,334 --> 01:46:19,167
Well, sure looks like
the fat's in the fire this time.

1160
01:46:19,254 --> 01:46:22,963
What them deputies wanna hurt the camp
for? How come they can't let us alone?

1161
01:46:23,054 --> 01:46:28,208
- We ought to get some pickaxe handles...
- No. That's just what they want.

1162
01:46:28,294 --> 01:46:32,765
No, sirree. If they can get a fight going
they can call in the cops. Say we ain't orderly.

1163
01:46:32,854 --> 01:46:35,687
- They're here. We got 'em spotted.
- Everything ready?

1164
01:46:35,774 --> 01:46:38,811
- There ain't gonna be trouble.
- I don't want you hurting them.

1165
01:46:38,894 --> 01:46:42,250
Don't worry. Everything's arranged.
Maybe nobody will see it.

1166
01:46:42,334 --> 01:46:47,124
Well, just don't use no sticks
or no knives or no piece of iron.

1167
01:46:47,214 --> 01:46:50,650
If you gotta sock 'em,
sock 'em where they ain't going to bleed.

1168
01:47:04,334 --> 01:47:07,610
Gentlemen, hats off please. Thank you.

1169
01:47:23,934 --> 01:47:29,930
- She's getting purdier every day, Ma.
- Girl with a baby's always purdier.

1170
01:47:47,534 --> 01:47:51,004
- Come on, Ma, let's dance.
- Oh, Tom. I can't.

1171
01:47:52,254 --> 01:47:54,245
Well, all right.

1172
01:47:58,294 --> 01:48:00,285
Tom, stop.

1173
01:48:07,374 --> 01:48:12,164

1179
01:48:45,534 --> 01:48:47,923
All right. 9.30. Here we go.

1180
01:48:52,814 --> 01:48:55,282
- All right. I'll dance with her.
- You and who else?

1181
01:48:55,374 --> 01:48:57,524
Excuse me, Ma.

1182

<i>(klaxons)</i>

01:49:05,334 --> 01:49:07,404
Open up! We're here about a riot!

1184
01:49:07,494 --> 01:49:11,612
- Riot? I don't see any riot. Who are you?
- Deputy sheriffs.

1185
01:49:11,694 --> 01:49:14,891
- You got a warrant?
- We don't need a warrant when there's a riot.

1186
01:49:14,974 --> 01:49:18,728
I don't know what you're going to do about it.
I don't hear or see any riot.

1187
01:49:18,814 --> 01:49:23,524
What's more, I don't believe there is any riot.
Look for yourself.

<i>(music plays)</i>

1189
01:49:34,574 --> 01:49:36,565

01:51:14,254 --> 01:51:18,213
We'll have a warrant

1194

Tommy.

1195
01:52:42,094 --> 01:52:44,892
Ain't you gonna tell me goodbye?

1196
01:52:51,694 --> 01:52:53,924
I didn't know, Ma.

1197
01:52:54,014 --> 01:52:55,811
I didn't know if I ought to.

1198
01:52:55,894 --> 01:52:59,011
- <i>(Ruthie)</i> Ma...
- Hush, Ruthie.

1199
01:53:01,574 --> 01:53:03,565
Come outside.

1200
01:53:38,894 --> 01:53:43,046
There was some cops here tonight.
They was taking down licence numbers.

1201
01:53:43,134 --> 01:53:45,284
I guess somebody knows something.

1202
01:53:45,374 --> 01:53:48,969
I guess it had to come. Sooner or later.

1203
01:54:24,494 --> 01:54:26,883
Sit down for a minute.

1204
01:54:29,294 --> 01:54:31,808
I'd like to stay, Ma.

1205
01:54:31,894 --> 01:54:37,605
I'd like to be with you and see your face when
you and Pa get settled in some nice place.

1206
01:54:37,694 --> 01:54:40,288
I'd sure like to see you then.

1207
01:54:41,814 --> 01:54:45,807
But I won't never get that chance,
I guess now.

1208
01:54:45,894 --> 01:54:49,967
- I could hide you, Tommy.
- I know you would, but I ain't gonna let you.

1209
01:54:50,054 --> 01:54:54,923
You hide somebody that's killed a guy
and you're in trouble too.

1210
01:54:55,014 --> 01:54:57,574
All right, Tommy.

1211
01:54:57,654 --> 01:55:01,203
But what do you figure you're going to do?

1212
01:55:01,294 --> 01:55:04,206
You know what I've been thinking about?

1213
01:55:04,294 --> 01:55:06,524
About Casy.

1214
01:55:06,614 --> 01:55:08,969
About what he said.

1215
01:55:09,054 --> 01:55:11,204
What he done.

1216
01:55:11,294 --> 01:55:13,285
About how he died.

1217
01:55:14,414 --> 01:55:17,212
And I remember all of it.

1218
01:55:18,654 --> 01:55:21,122
He was a good man.

1219
01:55:21,214 --> 01:55:23,887
I've been thinking about us too.

1220
01:55:23,974 --> 01:55:29,890
About our people living like pigs
and good, rich land laying fallow.

1221
01:55:31,214 --> 01:55:36,925
Or maybe one guy with a million acres
and 100,000 farmers starving.

1222
01:55:37,014 --> 01:55:39,574
And I've been wondering if...

1223
01:55:39,654 --> 01:55:42,009
all our folks got together and yelled...

1224
01:55:42,094 --> 01:55:44,244
No. They'd drive you out and cut you down.

1225
01:55:44,334 --> 01:55:47,690
- Just like they done to Casy.
- They're gonna drive me anyways.

1226
01:55:47,774 --> 01:55:52,006
Sooner or later they'd get me,
for one thing if not for another.

1227
01:55:52,094 --> 01:55:54,164
Till then...

1228
01:55:54,254 --> 01:55:55,733
Tommy.

1229
01:55:55,814 --> 01:56:00,046
- You're not aiming to kill nobody?
- No, Ma. Not that. That ain't it.

1230
01:56:00,134 --> 01:56:02,170
It's just...

1231
01:56:02,254 --> 01:56:06,327
Well, as long as I' an outlaw anyways,
maybe I can do something.

1232
01:56:06,414 --> 01:56:09,008
Maybe I can just find out something.

1233
01:56:09,094 --> 01:56:15,249
Just... scrounge around
and maybe find out what it is that's wrong.

1234
01:56:15,334 --> 01:56:20,567
Then see if they ain't something
that can be done about it.

1235
01:56:20,654 --> 01:56:23,964
I ain't thought it all out clear, Ma. I...

1236
01:56:24,054 --> 01:56:26,443
I can't. I don't know enough.

1237
01:56:27,454 --> 01:56:30,127
How am I gonna know about you, Tommy?

1238
01:56:30,214 --> 01:56:35,652
Why, they could kill you and I'd never know.
They could hurt you. How am I gonna know?

1239
01:56:37,694 --> 01:56:41,482
Well, maybe it's like Casy says.

1240
01:56:42,494 --> 01:56:48,046
Fella ain't got a soul of his own,
just... a little piece of a big soul.

1241
01:56:48,134 --> 01:56:52,173
The one big soul
that belongs to everybody.

1242
01:56:52,254 --> 01:56:54,131
Then...

1243
01:56:54,214 --> 01:56:57,251
- Then what, Tom?
- Then it don't matter.

1244
01:56:58,054 --> 01:57:00,966
I'll be all around in the dark.

1245
01:57:01,054 --> 01:57:02,851
I'll be everywhere.

1246
01:57:02,934 --> 01:57:05,129
Wherever you can look.

1247
01:57:06,094 --> 01:57:11,487
Wherever there's a fight
so hungry people can eat, I'll be there.

1248
01:57:12,094 --> 01:57:16,565
Wherever there's a cop beating up a guy,
I'll be there.

1249
01:57:17,974 --> 01:57:21,649
I'll be in the way guys yell when they're mad.

1250
01:57:21,734 --> 01:57:27,650
I'll be in the way kids laugh when they're
hungry and they know supper's ready.

1251
01:57:28,374 --> 01:57:32,526
And when people
are eating the stuff they raise...

1252
01:57:33,334 --> 01:57:36,565
living in the houses they build...

1253
01:57:36,654 --> 01:57:38,645
I'll be there too.

1254
01:57:42,414 --> 01:57:44,689
I don't understand it, Tom.

1255
01:57:45,894 --> 01:57:47,885
Me neither, Ma, but...

1256
01:57:49,054 --> 01:57:53,013
just something I've been thinking about.

1257
01:57:53,094 --> 01:57:55,813
Give me your hand, Ma.

1258
01:57:57,414 --> 01:57:58,972
Goodbye.

1259
01:57:59,054 --> 01:58:01,124
Goodbye, Tommy.

1260
01:58:01,214 --> 01:58:04,411
Later, when this is blowed over,

1261
01:58:04,494 --> 01:58:06,405
you'll come back.

1262
01:58:06,494 --> 01:58:08,485
Sure, Ma.

1263
01:58:09,614 --> 01:58:13,004
Tommy, we ain't the kissing kind, but...

1264
01:58:20,454 --> 01:58:22,809
Goodbye, Ma.

1265
01:58:22,894 --> 01:58:24,885
Goodbye, Tommy.

1266
01:58:32,854 --> 01:58:34,845
Tommy...

1267
01:59:11,814 --> 01:59:13,805
Goodbye.

1268
01:59:17,814 --> 01:59:20,123
Turn that up, Al, and get her rolled up.

1269
01:59:20,214 --> 01:59:22,170
- How you fixed, John?
- Getting along.

1270
01:59:22,254 --> 01:59:24,245
Here.

1271
01:59:25,054 --> 01:59:26,965
Winfield, get on top, out of the way.

1272
01:59:27,054 --> 01:59:31,684
I don't see what you folks are hurrying so for.
They tell me there's 20 days' work up there.

1273
01:59:31,774 --> 01:59:34,208
Yes, sir, and we aim to get in all 20 of them.

1274
01:59:34,294 --> 01:59:37,366
- All ready, Ma?
- Yes. How you feeling, Rosasharn?

1275
01:59:37,454 --> 01:59:41,049
All aboard, everybody. All aboard for Fresno.

1276
01:59:41,134 --> 01:59:43,602
Wait a minute. I'll give you a hand.

1277
01:59:43,694 --> 01:59:46,492
- Careful of her, now.
- Easy, child.

1278
01:59:51,774 --> 01:59:53,765
She'll be all right.

1279
01:59:57,214 --> 02:00:00,411
- Watch her, John.
- I'll take care of her.

1280
02:00:01,854 --> 02:00:04,846
- How are you fixed, Al?
- All right, Pa.

1281
02:00:08,654 --> 02:00:10,645
Now, Ma.

1282
02:00:22,534 --> 02:00:24,525
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

1283
02:00:26,254 --> 02:00:28,927
- Thanks a lot. Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

1284
02:00:29,054 --> 02:00:31,090
Thanks, Mr Conway.

1285
02:00:33,814 --> 02:00:35,805
- Bye.
- You be careful.

1286
02:00:54,694 --> 02:00:57,492
20 days work. Oh, boy!

1287
02:00:57,574 --> 02:01:02,284
I'll be glad to get my hands on some cotton.
That's the kind of picking I understand.

1288
02:01:02,374 --> 02:01:06,925
Maybe. Maybe 20 days' work
and maybe no days' work.

1289
02:01:07,014 --> 02:01:10,723
- We ain't got it till we get it.
- What's the matter, Ma? Getting scared?

1290
02:01:10,814 --> 02:01:12,725
Scared. Huh!

1291
02:01:12,814 --> 02:01:15,487
I ain't never gonna be scared no more.

1292
02:01:15,574 --> 02:01:21,206
I was though. For a while it looked
as though we was beat. Good and beat.

1293
02:01:21,294 --> 02:01:24,491
Looked like we didn't have nobody
in the world but enemies.

1294
02:01:24,574 --> 02:01:27,407
Like nobody was friendly no more.

1295
02:01:27,494 --> 02:01:30,884
Made me feel kind of bad and scared too.

1296
02:01:30,974 --> 02:01:33,772
Like we was lost and nobody cared.

1297
02:01:35,414 --> 02:01:38,372
You're the one that keeps us going, Ma.

1298
02:01:38,454 --> 02:01:41,332
I ain't no good no more and I know it.

1299
02:01:41,414 --> 02:01:46,124
Seems like I spend all my time these days
thinking how it used to be.

1300
02:01:46,214 --> 02:01:48,887
Thinking of home.

1301
02:01:48,974 --> 02:01:51,169
I ain't never gonna see it no more.

1302
02:01:51,254 --> 02:01:55,805
Well, Pa, a woman can change
better than a man.

1303
02:01:55,894 --> 02:02:00,092
A man lives sort of, well, in jerks.

1304
02:02:00,174 --> 02:02:02,734
Baby's born or somebody dies,
and that's ajerk.

1305
02:02:02,814 --> 02:02:06,568
He gets a farm or loses it, and that's ajerk.

1306
02:02:06,654 --> 02:02:10,124
With a woman it's all in one flow
like a stream.

1307
02:02:10,214 --> 02:02:16,050
Little eddies and waterfalls,
but the river, it goes right on.

1308
02:02:16,134 --> 02:02:18,807
A woman looks at it that way.

1309
02:02:20,934 --> 02:02:25,325
- Well, maybe, but we're sure taking a beating.
- I know.

1310
02:02:26,174 --> 02:02:28,404
That's what makes us tough.

1311
02:02:28,494 --> 02:02:33,443
Rich fellas come up, and they die,
and their kids ain't no good and they die out.

1312
02:02:33,534 --> 02:02:37,368
But we keep coming.
We're the people that live.

1313
02:02:37,454 --> 02:02:40,605
They can't wipe us out. They can't lick us.

1314
02:02:40,694 --> 02:02:44,892
We'll go on forever, Pa, cos we're the people.

1315
02:03:42,014 --> 02:03:45,006
