00:09:31,517 --> 00:09:34,418
- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!

193
00:09:34,787 --> 00:09:36,778
Let's get to work.

194
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:39,950
We have to find the steps
that lead up to the attic.

195
00:09:40,059 --> 00:09:41,151
What?

196
00:09:41,261 --> 00:09:42,558
Find the way up.

197
00:09:42,662 --> 00:09:45,358
<i>We'll open all the windows upstairs.</i>

198
00:09:45,465 --> 00:09:46,056
Yeah!

199
00:09:46,165 --> 00:09:47,655
<i>Hey, wait for me.</i>

200
00:09:54,507 --> 00:09:55,735
Ha ha.

201
00:09:55,842 --> 00:09:57,332
No stairs.

202
00:09:59,646 --> 00:10:00,578
No.

203
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:04,648
Nothing here.

204
00:10:04,751 --> 00:10:05,945
Nothing here.

205
00:10:08,888 --> 00:10:10,116
Nope. Nothing there.

206
00:10:10,223 --> 00:10:12,350
Ha ha ha!
Nothing there.

207
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:13,755
Hee hee hee!

208
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:14,758
Ow.

209
00:10:14,861 --> 00:10:17,193
Nobody in this room.

210
00:10:17,297 --> 00:10:18,855
Nobody here!

211
00:10:19,866 --> 00:10:21,265
- Hi!
- Ha ha ha!

212
00:10:21,367 --> 00:10:22,334
Hey!

213
00:10:22,435 --> 00:10:23,163
Ha ha ha!

214
00:10:23,269 --> 00:10:24,930
Ohh!

215
00:10:31,244 --> 00:10:33,542
<i>Come here, Mai! I found it!</i>

216
00:10:33,646 --> 00:10:36,137
Hee hee hee!

217
00:10:36,249 --> 00:10:37,113
Wow.

218
00:10:39,719 --> 00:10:41,380
Someone up there?

219
00:10:41,487 --> 00:10:43,614
Catch some ghosts upstairs?

220
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:46,156
- Ohh!
- Ohh!

221
00:10:47,427 --> 00:10:48,485
<i>It's an acorn.</i>

222
00:10:49,362 --> 00:10:50,090
Uh-oh.

223
00:10:50,196 --> 00:10:50,787
Uhh!

224
00:10:51,531 --> 00:10:53,021
They must like them.

225
00:10:59,439 --> 00:11:03,307
Little dust bunnies,
go away right now!

226
00:11:08,414 --> 00:11:09,779
Oh.

227
00:11:09,882 --> 00:11:11,474
Heh heh heh.

228
00:11:11,584 --> 00:11:12,949
Hmm.

229
00:11:25,798 --> 00:11:29,962
- Aah!
- Aah!

230
00:11:30,069 --> 00:11:31,468
Aah.

231
00:11:41,981 --> 00:11:44,472
<i>Don't be scared, Mai.
There's nothing to be afraid of.</i>

232
00:11:44,584 --> 00:11:46,176
<i>There's nobody here.</i>

233
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:48,318
[Whoosh]

234
00:11:48,421 --> 00:11:49,888
- Ohh!
- Ohh!

235
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:53,288
Aah!

236
00:11:53,393 --> 00:11:54,883
Oh.

237
00:11:59,899 --> 00:12:04,029
[Whoosh]

238
00:12:04,137 --> 00:12:05,069
Ohh!

239
00:12:05,772 --> 00:12:06,534
There.

240
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:10,272
<i>That's it. Easy.</i>

241
00:12:10,376 --> 00:12:11,570
Slowly.

242
00:12:11,677 --> 00:12:13,201
Guess what.

243
00:12:13,312 --> 00:12:15,371
Something's really living upstairs
after all!

244
00:12:15,481 --> 00:12:17,574
<i>That's wonderful. Good for you.</i>

245
00:12:17,683 --> 00:12:20,083
<i>I've always wanted
to have a haunted house.</i>

246
00:12:20,186 --> 00:12:22,051
<i>It's been my lifelong dream.</i>

247
00:12:22,155 --> 00:12:22,746
Uhh!

248
00:12:22,855 --> 00:12:23,753
Careful!

249
00:12:23,856 --> 00:12:24,754
Oh!
[Crash]

250
00:12:24,857 --> 00:12:26,518
Ooh!

251
00:12:50,383 --> 00:12:52,374
Aah!
[Whoosh]

252
00:13:11,904 --> 00:13:14,395
<i>Guess what, Sis! I got one!</i>

253
00:13:21,914 --> 00:13:23,074
Uhh!

254
00:13:25,685 --> 00:13:26,344
Eh?

255
00:13:26,452 --> 00:13:27,749
Aah!

256
00:13:29,288 --> 00:13:30,312
Mai?

257
00:13:32,859 --> 00:13:33,757
Oh.

258
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:34,827
Aah!

259
00:13:35,094 --> 00:13:35,958
Huh!

260
00:13:36,062 --> 00:13:36,960
Whoo whoo!

261
00:13:37,063 --> 00:13:38,428
Ah! Ah! Ah.

262
00:13:39,599 --> 00:13:40,998
Two fine kids.

263
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:45,002
<i>There's nothing to be frightened about.
Nanny has the farm next door.</i>

264
00:13:45,104 --> 00:13:46,093
She's helping us out.

265
00:13:46,606 --> 00:13:48,699
<i>Nanny, this is Mai, my sister,</i>

266
00:13:48,808 --> 00:13:50,036
<i>and I'm Satsuki.</i>

267
00:13:50,143 --> 00:13:52,771
Very pleased to meet both of you.

268
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:57,373
<i>lf I'd known
what a hurry you were in to move,</i>

269
00:13:57,483 --> 00:13:59,508
I would've cleaned the house up.

270
00:14:00,786 --> 00:14:03,380
<i>It really isn't necessary.</i>

271
00:14:03,489 --> 00:14:04,456
Aah!

272
00:14:04,557 --> 00:14:08,687
I've been so busy
in the rice paddies lately. . .

273
00:14:08,794 --> 00:14:11,592
How did you get all that black on you?

274
00:14:11,697 --> 00:14:13,892
I had a dust bunny right in my hand.

275
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,127
<i>Ohh! Mai, your feet!</i>

276
00:14:16,469 --> 00:14:18,130
Uh-oh.

277
00:14:18,237 --> 00:14:20,137
To do a little dusting. . .

278
00:14:20,239 --> 00:14:22,070
<i>You got mine black, too!</i>

279
00:14:22,175 --> 00:14:23,904
Eh?

280
00:14:29,348 --> 00:14:30,246
Aha!

281
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:33,310
It appears the soot sprites
are hard at work.

282
00:14:33,419 --> 00:14:34,909
What are they?

283
00:14:35,021 --> 00:14:36,921
You mean those black little fuzzy things

284
00:14:37,023 --> 00:14:40,220
that fly around and disappear upstairs?

285
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:44,596
Yes. They breed
in very old empty houses,

286
00:14:44,697 --> 00:14:48,224
building invisible nests
and turning everything into dust.

287
00:14:49,168 --> 00:14:52,763
<i>l could see them, too,
when I was a very small child.</i>

288
00:14:52,872 --> 00:14:56,467
That you two are able to see them
makes me very glad.

289
00:14:56,576 --> 00:14:58,976
<i>It couldn't have been a spirit,
could it?</i>

290
00:14:59,078 --> 00:15:00,545
<i>If they're not sprites,</i>

291
00:15:00,646 --> 00:15:02,910
then you have nothing
to be frightened about.

292
00:15:03,015 --> 00:15:06,712
lf we keep smiling,
the sprites may gradually go away

293
00:15:06,819 --> 00:15:08,377
and leave this place alone.

294
00:15:08,854 --> 00:15:12,085
<i>Yes. I'm sure that
somewhere up in that ceiling</i>

295
00:15:12,191 --> 00:15:15,388
they're busily discussing plans
for leaving the house.

296
00:15:15,494 --> 00:15:18,429
[Chattering]

297
00:15:19,865 --> 00:15:21,526
Maybe they really will leave us alone.

298
00:15:21,634 --> 00:15:23,033
<i>What's wrong with them?</i>

299
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:25,603
With dust bunnies all over the house?

300
00:15:25,705 --> 00:15:27,297
<i>I'm not afraid of dust bunnies.</i>

301
00:15:27,406 --> 00:15:31,274
Maybe you can go to the bathroom
by yourself at night.

302
00:15:31,377 --> 00:15:33,470
Ha ha ha!

303
00:15:33,579 --> 00:15:36,070
Come. The house needs cleaning up.

304
00:15:36,182 --> 00:15:38,207
Fetch a bucket and go get some water.

305
00:15:38,484 --> 00:15:39,576
From the stream?

306
00:15:39,685 --> 00:15:41,209
<i>Maybe we'll catch a fish!</i>

307
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,811
- Ha ha ha!
- Hee hee hee!

308
00:15:44,724 --> 00:15:46,715
<i>You wait here, O. K.?</i>

309
00:15:55,735 --> 00:15:57,669
Did you get any fish?

310
00:16:08,247 --> 00:16:09,680
Ha ha!

311
00:16:09,782 --> 00:16:11,443
<i>It's coming out!
It's coming out, Nanny!</i>

312
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:14,075
Good. Very good.

313
00:16:14,186 --> 00:16:16,416
Just keep at it
till the water gets cold.

314
00:16:16,522 --> 00:16:17,489
Right.

315
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:18,522
Ha!

316
00:16:18,624 --> 00:16:19,613
Ha!

317
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:20,691
Oh.

318
00:16:58,964 --> 00:17:00,056
Huh!

319
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:02,726
<i>Hey, is that for us?
Is that for me?</i>

320
00:17:02,835 --> 00:17:04,700
Tell me what your name is.

321
00:17:04,804 --> 00:17:07,068
<i>Uh, it's for Grandma.</i>

322
00:17:07,173 --> 00:17:08,640
Huh?

323
00:17:08,741 --> 00:17:10,299
Grandma?

324
00:17:11,444 --> 00:17:12,809
Yuh-uh-uh.

325
00:17:13,746 --> 00:17:14,644
Hmm?

326
00:17:14,747 --> 00:17:15,736
Mmm!

327
00:17:16,148 --> 00:17:16,739
Yuh-uh!

328
00:17:16,849 --> 00:17:18,077
<i>Hey, wait up! Where you going?</i>

329
00:17:18,984 --> 00:17:20,975
<i>Kanta, don't be silly.</i>

330
00:17:22,655 --> 00:17:25,146
<i>Hey, haven't you heard?</i>

331
00:17:25,257 --> 00:17:27,885
You re living in a haunted house!

332
00:17:27,993 --> 00:17:29,392
- Ohh!
- Go away!

333
00:17:29,495 --> 00:17:31,156
Yuh-uh!

334
00:17:31,263 --> 00:17:32,662

335
00:17:32,765 --> 00:17:33,993
Ehhhh!

336
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:38,997
Ha ha ha!

337
00:17:39,105 --> 00:17:42,233
l remember doing that
when I was his age.

338
00:17:42,742 --> 00:17:46,337
l hate boys, but I love Nanny's food
better than anything else

339
00:17:46,445 --> 00:17:48,003
in the whole wide world.

340
00:17:48,347 --> 00:17:50,611
Eat all you want.

341
00:17:51,117 --> 00:17:52,345
Thanks for your help!

342
00:17:52,451 --> 00:17:53,782
Bye!

343
00:17:55,521 --> 00:17:57,512
<i>Thank you so much, Nanny.</i>

344
00:17:58,724 --> 00:18:00,453
Bye-bye! Bye-bye!

00:19:15,267 --> 00:19:18,600
<i>I'm scared the wind's going
to make the house fall down.</i>

349
00:19:20,372 --> 00:19:23,637
Maybe it will, but I hope not
because we just moved in.

350
00:19:23,742 --> 00:19:24,640
Huh?
[Crash]

351
00:19:24,743 --> 00:19:25,710

Aah!

- Ha ha ha!
- Ohh!

354
00:19:58,077 --> 00:19:59,669
Come on. What are you waiting for?

355
00:19:59,778 --> 00:20:02,406
You have to laugh loud
to scare a spirit.

356
00:20:02,515 --> 00:20:04,142
Ha ha ha!

357
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:05,911
<i>I'm not scared at all.</i>

358
00:20:06,018 --> 00:20:07,679
Uh huh ha ha.

359
00:20:07,786 --> 00:20:09,686
I'm not! I mean it!

00:20:09,788 --> 00:20:12,086
Aah! Ha ha ha!

That's it. Give it all you got.

369

Come on. Yeah.

370
00:21:01,206 --> 00:21:02,730
There we go.

371

we're finished.</i>

<i>My love, I'm so happy to see you.</i>

396
00:22:48,747 --> 00:22:51,739
Daddy took the wrong road.
We had to come another way.

397
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:54,318
<i>Well. Don't be shy.</i>

398
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:56,217
We got off today from school.

Wonderful.

400
00:22:57,456 --> 00:23:00,448
<i>Daddy said to tell you he'll be here.</i>

401
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:02,424
<i>He's probably speaking to the doctor.</i>

402

Ohh! You mean they live upstairs?

Mm-hmm.

407
00:23:13,672 --> 00:23:16,038
Do you like fuzzy spirits, Mommy?

408
00:23:16,141 --> 00:23:19,702
Yes. I wish I could go see them now.

409
00:23:19,812 --> 00:23:20,972
You were right, Mai.

410
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,240
Mm-hmm.

411
00:23:22,347 --> 00:23:25,646
We thought you might not be happy
about the house having spooks.

412
00:23:25,751 --> 00:23:27,150
Are you happy with them?

413
00:23:27,252 --> 00:23:28,150
Yep.

Mm-hmm.

00:23:35,761 --> 00:23:37,695
<i>They're beautiful.</i>

<i>You know, you're a very lucky girl.</i>

419
00:23:40,165 --> 00:23:41,928
She always gets mad at me.

420
00:23:42,034 --> 00:23:44,161
<i>That's because
you re always jumping around.</i>

421
00:23:44,269 --> 00:23:46,260
<i>Satsuki, come here.</i>

422
00:23:46,371 --> 00:23:48,430
<i>Why don't you let me brush your hair?</i>

423
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:50,167
<i>I'm glad it's short.</i>

424
00:23:50,275 --> 00:23:51,674
I want mine short.

428

<i>I'll be able to have hair

429

<i>when I'm older, right?</i>

430
00:24:02,621 --> 00:24:05,055
Yes. I know that

431
00:24:05,157 --> 00:24:08,217

when I was young.

432
00:24:11,096 --> 00:24:12,324

I thought Mommy looked a lot better.

438
00:24:26,445 --> 00:24:30,279
l think the doctor
might let her leave shortly.

439
00:24:30,382 --> 00:24:32,509
Does that mean tomorrow, Daddy?

440
00:24:32,618 --> 00:24:34,779
<i>Aw, tomorrow means tomorrow.</i>

441
00:24:34,887 --> 00:24:36,718
Maybe not tomorrow,
but it's pretty soon.

442
00:24:36,822 --> 00:24:40,485
<i>She said when she comes,
she'll only sleep in my bed.</i>

443
00:24:40,592 --> 00:24:44,494
You said you were big enough
to sleep by yourself.

444
00:24:44,596 --> 00:24:46,757

<i>Hey, Mai, don't follow me!</i>

926
01:05:22,298 --> 01:05:24,266
Go to Nanny's house.

927
01:05:31,341 --> 01:05:32,308
Oh.

928
01:05:59,535 --> 01:06:00,763
<i>Hello, Operator.</i>

929
01:06:00,870 --> 01:06:02,929
I'd like to make
a long-distance call, please.

930
01:06:03,039 --> 01:06:04,438
It's very important.

931
01:06:04,540 --> 01:06:06,974
It's number 1354 at Station 12.

932
01:06:07,076 --> 01:06:07,940
Yes.

933
01:06:08,044 --> 01:06:09,443
Thank you very much.

934
01:06:09,545 --> 01:06:11,035
Your friend is very pretty.

935
01:06:11,147 --> 01:06:12,478
What lovely hair.

936
01:06:13,650 --> 01:06:14,912
[Ring]

937
01:06:15,018 --> 01:06:16,451
Hello.

938
01:06:16,552 --> 01:06:17,678
Yes.

939
01:06:18,554 --> 01:06:20,283
Can you put me through
to the Main lecture room

940
01:06:20,390 --> 01:06:21,823
of the Anthropology School?

941
01:06:21,924 --> 01:06:23,448
To Professor Kusakabe.
Please hurry.

942
01:06:23,926 --> 01:06:26,292
<i>Yes, yes.
I'm his daughter.</i>

943
01:06:30,199 --> 01:06:32,258
<i>It was from the hospital, Daddy.
I'm so worried.</i>

944
01:06:32,368 --> 01:06:34,268
Whoa, whoa. Slow down.

945
01:06:34,937 --> 01:06:38,270
<i>From the hospital?
Oh, O. K. It's all right.</i>

946
01:06:38,374 --> 01:06:39,773
<i>I think I understand.</i>

947
01:06:39,876 --> 01:06:41,468
<i>Now, I'm going to call the hospital.</i>

948
01:06:41,577 --> 01:06:43,772
What's happened to Mommy?

949
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:45,507
<i>There's no need to worry.</i>

950
01:06:45,615 --> 01:06:49,517
<i>I'll check with the hospital
and call you right back, O. K.?</i>

951
01:06:49,619 --> 01:06:50,210
Uh-huh.

952
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:51,947
<i>Stay where you are.</i>

953
01:06:52,055 --> 01:06:53,886
I'm hanging up,
so you stay right there.

954
01:06:56,092 --> 01:06:57,684
He'll be calling back.
So is it all right

955
01:06:57,794 --> 01:06:59,887
if I stay here
by the telephone and wait?

956
01:07:00,463 --> 01:07:02,693
You take all the time you need.

957
01:07:09,806 --> 01:07:12,536
<i>Hey, where are you?</i>

958
01:07:13,309 --> 01:07:15,140
Uh-oh.

959
01:07:15,978 --> 01:07:16,876
[Baa]

960
01:07:17,747 --> 01:07:19,578
[Baa]

961
01:07:20,917 --> 01:07:21,906
Oh, no!

962
01:07:22,018 --> 01:07:23,883
<i>I'm giving this to my Mommy!</i>

963
01:07:23,986 --> 01:07:25,453
[Baa]

964
01:07:25,555 --> 01:07:26,522
Go away!

965
01:07:26,622 --> 01:07:29,216
You just better stop it right now!

966
01:07:29,859 --> 01:07:31,326
[Baa]

967
01:07:44,874 --> 01:07:48,674
<i>Mai, the hospital said
that Mommy's condition isn't very good,</i>

968
01:07:48,778 --> 01:07:51,508
so she won't be coming home just yet.

969
01:07:51,614 --> 01:07:52,603
But why?

970
01:07:53,683 --> 01:07:55,344
<i>Mai, what can we do?</i>

971
01:07:55,451 --> 01:07:57,476
<i>lf she came home now,
it'd make it worse.</i>

972
01:07:57,587 --> 01:07:59,487
It would not!

973
01:08:00,523 --> 01:08:02,718
But she'll be able
to come home real soon.

974
01:08:02,825 --> 01:08:04,725
No!

975
01:08:05,795 --> 01:08:07,990
<i>All right then! Be that way!
Let's see if she dies!</i>

976
01:08:08,097 --> 01:08:10,031
No!

977
01:08:10,466 --> 01:08:11,524
<i>Don't be dumb, Mai!</i>

978
01:08:11,634 --> 01:08:12,999
<i>Oh, I give up!</i>

979
01:08:13,102 --> 01:08:14,626
<i>You're so stupid!</i>

980
01:08:24,046 --> 01:08:25,035
Come on, Mai.

981
01:08:25,882 --> 01:08:27,975
Waah!

982
01:08:28,084 --> 01:08:31,019
<i>I'm not stupid!</i>

983
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:32,212
Waah!

984
01:08:59,081 --> 01:09:02,107
I took care of the rest of the washing.

985
01:09:04,353 --> 01:09:05,445
Come on, now.

986
01:09:05,555 --> 01:09:08,023
It isn't the end of the world.

987
01:09:08,124 --> 01:09:10,024
<i>Your old Nanny's here to help.</i>

988
01:09:10,126 --> 01:09:12,617
Let's see that beautiful smile.

989
01:09:14,397 --> 01:09:16,194
<i>Your father's stopping off
at the hospital</i>

990
01:09:16,299 --> 01:09:18,130
<i>on his way home, eh?</i>

991
01:09:18,634 --> 01:09:20,124
What I heard was that your mother

992
01:09:20,236 --> 01:09:23,171
only caught a small cold.

993
01:09:23,272 --> 01:09:25,467
<i>She'll be home next weekend,
I believe.</i>

994
01:09:25,575 --> 01:09:28,772
That s what they said last time, too.

995
01:09:30,213 --> 01:09:31,771
<i>"It'll be a little visit,</i>

996
01:09:31,881 --> 01:09:33,781
<i>just a few days
to see what's wrong with her.</i>

997
01:09:34,450 --> 01:09:36,384
<i>It's just a cold."</i>

998
01:09:37,687 --> 01:09:39,882
What are me and Mai going to do
if Mommy dies?

999
01:09:39,989 --> 01:09:41,889
Uh, uh. . .

1000
01:09:42,458 --> 01:09:44,585
<i>What are we going to do, Nanny?</i>

1001
01:09:48,898 --> 01:09:51,230
There, there.

1002
01:09:53,803 --> 01:09:55,202
<i>Don't worry.</i>

1003
01:09:55,304 --> 01:09:57,465
<i>Your mother's not going to die.</i>

1004
01:09:57,573 --> 01:09:58,767
Hush.

1005
01:09:58,875 --> 01:10:01,002
<i>She'd never leave
two such beautiful children.</i>

1006
01:10:01,110 --> 01:10:03,510
She loves you too much for that.

1007
01:10:03,613 --> 01:10:04,739
<i>Don't cry.</i>

1008
01:10:05,815 --> 01:10:08,511
Nanny will stay with you
until your father comes home.

1009
01:10:41,517 --> 01:10:43,280
Mai!

1010
01:10:46,956 --> 01:10:49,288
Where are you?

1011
01:10:54,196 --> 01:10:55,788
Mai!

1012
01:10:55,898 --> 01:10:58,423
[Cicada chirping]

1013
01:10:58,534 --> 01:11:01,128
<i>Mai, come back!</i>

1014
01:11:03,539 --> 01:11:04,528
Did you see her anywhere?

1015
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:06,130
No sign at all.

1016
01:11:06,242 --> 01:11:08,301
<i>She wasn't at the bus stop?</i>

1017
01:11:09,045 --> 01:11:10,307
That's very strange.

1018
01:11:10,413 --> 01:11:12,210
Where could she possibly have gone?

1019
01:11:12,315 --> 01:11:14,180
Maybe she's angry about this morning.

1020
01:11:14,283 --> 01:11:16,683
We had a bad argument and -

1021
01:11:16,786 --> 01:11:19,220
maybe she went to visit Mommy
in the hospital!

1022
01:11:19,322 --> 01:11:21,017
<i>The hospital's so far from here.</i>

1023
01:11:21,123 --> 01:11:22,522
<i>It's - oh, my heavens!</i>

1024
01:11:22,625 --> 01:11:24,525
It would take a grown man

1025
01:11:24,627 --> 01:11:26,288
three hours to get there.

1026
01:11:27,363 --> 01:11:29,024
Hey!

1027
01:11:29,131 --> 01:11:30,291
<i>Oh, my goodness.</i>

1028
01:11:30,399 --> 01:11:32,560
Please, you must get your father
right now.

1029
01:11:32,668 --> 01:11:34,966
Tell him little Mai has disappeared.

1030
01:11:38,841 --> 01:11:41,173
[Panting]

1031
01:11:43,846 --> 01:11:46,747
How could you do
something so stupid, Mai?

1032
01:11:46,849 --> 01:11:48,339
You always get lost.

1033
01:11:54,857 --> 01:11:56,620
Mai!

1034
01:12:03,599 --> 01:12:05,464
<i>I'm sorry to bother you,</i>

1035
01:12:05,568 --> 01:12:09,595
but you haven't seen
a little girl, have you?

1036
01:12:09,705 --> 01:12:11,866
<i>She's my sister, about 5 years old.</i>

1037
01:12:11,974 --> 01:12:14,442
<i>Well, seems to me I remember someone.</i>

1038
01:12:14,944 --> 01:12:18,072
Yes, near as I can recall,
she went that way.

1039
01:12:18,180 --> 01:12:20,148
Maybe she went through the forest.

1040
01:12:22,184 --> 01:12:24,516
<i>Then again, she might've gone
in the other direction.</i>

1041
01:12:24,620 --> 01:12:27,316
Are you sure it was your sister?

1042
01:12:39,068 --> 01:12:41,730
<i>All sorts of folks come by here,
but I don't see them.</i>

1043
01:12:41,837 --> 01:12:43,236
<i>Mai, I'm scared.</i>

1044
01:12:43,339 --> 01:12:44,670
Thank you!

1045
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:54,113
Mai!

1046
01:13:15,171 --> 01:13:16,502
Please stop!

1047
01:13:16,605 --> 01:13:19,301
Aah!

1048
01:13:19,408 --> 01:13:20,739
<i>Hey, are you crazy, kid?</i>

1049
01:13:20,843 --> 01:13:21,832
<i>I'm looking for my sister.</i>

1050
01:13:21,944 --> 01:13:23,775
Have you seen a little girl
wandering around?

1051
01:13:24,847 --> 01:13:25,575
<i>I'm afraid not.</i>

1052
01:13:25,948 --> 01:13:28,212
Mai's her name,
and she's 5 years old.

1053
01:13:28,317 --> 01:13:29,579
She probably got lost.

1054
01:13:29,685 --> 01:13:31,710
<i>We haven't seen anyone, have we?</i>

1055
01:13:31,821 --> 01:13:33,254
<i>l think she's going to
Shichikoku Yama.</i>

1056
01:13:33,355 --> 01:13:34,515
<i>We just came from there,</i>

1057
01:13:34,623 --> 01:13:38,457
<i>but we haven't come across anybody.</i>

1058
01:13:38,561 --> 01:13:39,994
Well, thank you.

1059
01:13:41,030 --> 01:13:42,998
<i>By the way, where are you from?</i>

1060
01:13:43,099 --> 01:13:43,997
Matsugo.

1061
01:13:44,100 --> 01:13:45,897
You walked from there to here?

1062
01:13:46,001 --> 01:13:47,491
That s three hours away.

1063
01:13:47,603 --> 01:13:49,696
Well, good luck, kid.

1064
01:13:49,805 --> 01:13:51,568
I hope you find her!

1065
01:14:01,550 --> 01:14:03,142
Satsuki, wait!

1066
01:14:03,252 --> 01:14:04,685
Come here!

1067
01:14:04,787 --> 01:14:06,448
Kanta!

1068
01:14:08,324 --> 01:14:10,485
<i>We haven't found her yet.
How about you?</i>

1069
01:14:10,593 --> 01:14:11,525
Nothing.

1070
01:14:11,627 --> 01:14:13,959
My dad's got everyone
searching for her,

1071
01:14:14,063 --> 01:14:14,893
<i>so you go home,</i>

1072
01:14:14,997 --> 01:14:17,261
<i>and I'll bike
to Shichikoku Yama, O. K.?</i>

1073
01:14:17,366 --> 01:14:19,766
<i>I'm afraid
if she visits Mommy's hospital,</i>

1074
01:14:19,869 --> 01:14:21,461
<i>she'll completely lose her -</i>

1075
01:14:21,570 --> 01:14:24,733
Somebody found
some sandals by the lake.

1076
01:14:25,908 --> 01:14:27,899
There's no way she could get
past all those people

1077
01:14:28,010 --> 01:14:29,841
without somebody noticing.

1078
01:14:29,945 --> 01:14:30,604
Oh!

1079
01:14:32,214 --> 01:14:35,206
<i>Hey, don't worry!
Nobody said they were Mai's sandals!</i>

1080
01:14:52,368 --> 01:14:54,302
Did you find her yet?

1081
01:15:25,100 --> 01:15:27,830
[Praying]

1082
01:15:29,572 --> 01:15:32,302
Go back a bit over towards your right!

1083
01:15:32,408 --> 01:15:34,376
<i>Hey, you have any poles left?</i>

1084
01:15:43,819 --> 01:15:45,309
<i>There's Satsuki.</i>

1085
01:15:45,421 --> 01:15:46,183
Eh?

1086
01:15:46,589 --> 01:15:47,920
Look.

1087
01:15:50,059 --> 01:15:50,650
Mai!

1088
01:15:50,759 --> 01:15:51,657
Mai!

1089
01:15:52,695 --> 01:15:54,663
Look, Satsuki.

1090
01:15:54,763 --> 01:15:56,731
Is it hers?

1091
01:16:03,339 --> 01:16:04,897
<i>It's not hers.</i>

1092
01:16:05,007 --> 01:16:06,975
What?

1093
01:16:11,847 --> 01:16:13,678
Ohh. . .

1094
01:16:15,618 --> 01:16:17,950
Merciful heavens.

1095
01:16:18,053 --> 01:16:19,213
<i>You know, Satsuki,</i>

1096
01:16:19,321 --> 01:16:21,255
<i>for a while
I thought it might be Mai's.</i>

1097
01:16:21,357 --> 01:16:24,349
Mom, I told you
you jumped to conclusions.

1098
01:16:24,460 --> 01:16:25,688
<i>Forget it! It isn't hers!</i>

1099
01:16:25,794 --> 01:16:27,694
<i>So, what do we do now?</i>

1100
01:16:27,796 --> 01:16:29,696
<i>We keep on looking, that's what.</i>

1101
01:16:29,798 --> 01:16:32,198
<i>Whatever you do, you better hurry up.</i>

1102
01:16:32,301 --> 01:16:33,700
<i>It'll be dark soon.</i>

1103
01:16:33,802 --> 01:16:35,201
I am grateful to you all.

1104
01:16:35,304 --> 01:16:37,204
If you could keep searching -

1105
01:16:37,306 --> 01:16:39,206
<i>Don't worry. We understand.</i>

1106
01:16:39,308 --> 01:16:42,505
<i>Don't you think
we should call the police?</i>

1107
01:16:42,611 --> 01:16:44,010
<i>Well, I don't know.</i>

1108
01:16:44,113 --> 01:16:45,705
Do you think the police could -

1109
01:16:45,814 --> 01:16:48,078
Where are you going?

1110
01:17:04,900 --> 01:17:06,390
<i>Totoro,</i>

<i>I beg you, please protect Mai.</i>

1112
01:17:08,337 --> 01:17:10,237
She ll be lost and probably scared.

1113
01:17:10,339 --> 01:17:12,739
<i>I'll be good for the rest of my life</i>

1114
01:17:12,841 --> 01:17:14,308
If I can just see her again.

1115
01:17:38,567 --> 01:17:39,795
Oh!

1116
01:17:39,902 --> 01:17:40,891
Aah!

1117
01:17:43,272 --> 01:17:44,136
What?

1118
01:17:44,873 --> 01:17:46,238
Totoro!

1119
01:17:47,977 --> 01:17:49,535
<i>Totoro, Mai's lost somewhere.</i>

1120
01:17:49,645 --> 01:17:52,136
<i>l looked and looked,
but I can't find her anywhere!</i>

1121
01:17:52,247 --> 01:17:53,145
<i>Oh, please.</i>

1122
01:17:53,248 --> 01:17:55,648
You have to help me find her.

1123
01:17:55,751 --> 01:17:59,209
<i>She's probably alone somewhere
crying and upset.</i>

1124
01:17:59,321 --> 01:18:01,789
<i>Oh, Totoro, I'm scared.</i>

<i>He wouldn't be able to.</i>

1131
01:19:00,282 --> 01:19:02,307
But how come nobody sees the bus?

1132
01:19:31,814 --> 01:19:33,179
Oh. . .

1133
01:19:33,282 --> 01:19:35,182

Mai, where are you?

1140
01:20:25,534 --> 01:20:27,365
But how does he make it do that?

[Barking]

1142
01:20:57,132 --> 01:20:59,225
Ohh. . .

1143
01:20:59,468 --> 01:21:01,766
Mai!

1144
01:21:04,406 --> 01:21:06,567
But, Sis, where are you?

There you are!

Satsuki!

1149
01:21:25,060 --> 01:21:26,049
Ha ha ha!

1150
01:21:27,095 --> 01:21:28,221
<i>Oh, Mai.</i>

1151
01:21:28,330 --> 01:21:30,594
I'm sorry.

1152
01:21:32,367 --> 01:21:33,231
Tell me one thing.

1153
01:21:33,335 --> 01:21:35,735
Were you bringing that corn
to the hospital?

1154
01:21:35,837 --> 01:21:37,236
Mm-hmm.

1155
01:21:37,339 --> 01:21:39,534

<i>You're wonderful!</i>

1162
01:22:02,631 --> 01:22:03,996
I'm sorry.

1163
01:22:04,099 --> 01:22:07,728
It was all because of my silly cold
that the hospital sent that telegram.

1164
01:22:07,836 --> 01:22:10,270
The grief it must've caused all of you.

1165
01:22:10,806 --> 01:22:12,535
I hope you can forgive me.

1166
01:22:12,641 --> 01:22:14,871
It was simply a bureaucratic mistake.

1167
01:22:14,977 --> 01:22:18,276
<i>I'm sure it wasn't terribly traumatic
for either of the girls.</i>

1168
01:22:18,380 --> 01:22:20,678
<i>It just means
you'll be home next weekend.</i>

1169
01:22:20,782 --> 01:22:21,874
They understand.

1170
01:22:21,984 --> 01:22:25,545
<i>l wouldn't be at all surprised
if they suffered more than we know,</i>

1171
01:22:25,654 --> 01:22:28,987
<i>in particular Satsuki
because she's so smart and sensitive.</i>

1172
01:22:29,091 --> 01:22:31,218
Hmm, could be right.

1173
01:22:31,493 --> 01:22:33,484
You'd better be careful
after I get home

1174
01:22:33,595 --> 01:22:35,995
because I intend to spoil them rotten.

1175
01:22:36,098 --> 01:22:37,087
Oh, no!

1176
01:22:44,373 --> 01:22:46,102
Look. Mommy's laughing.

1177
01:22:46,208 --> 01:22:47,675
She seems pretty healthy to me.

1178
01:22:47,776 --> 01:22:48,902
Yep.

1179
01:22:56,351 --> 01:22:58,581

on my feet again.</i>

Hmm.

1183
01:23:08,497 --> 01:23:10,021
<i>Now, that's weird.</i>

1184
01:23:10,132 --> 01:23:11,759
Oh!

1185
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:12,967
What happened?

1186
01:23:13,669 --> 01:23:15,261
<i>Well, I'm not sure,
but I could've sworn</i>

1187
01:23:15,370 --> 01:23:19,101
l saw both girls in the treetop
laughing.
