1
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:25,102
Let me get you another drink.

2
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:28,523
Mark, before Tony comes...

3
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:31,025
I ought to explain something.

4
00:02:31,193 --> 00:02:33,361
Yes, I've been waiting for that.

5
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:35,780
I haven't told him anything about us.

6
00:02:36,198 --> 00:02:38,241
That's not surprising.
It's a tough thing to do.

7
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:40,076
When you telephoned this morning...

8
00:02:40,244 --> 00:02:42,286
I simply said you wrote crime stories...

9
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:44,413
and I'd met you once
when you were here before.

10
00:02:45,581 --> 00:02:47,959
That has a pretty guilty ring to it.
I'd never use it in one of my stories.

11
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:52,046
Mark, I know you think it's silly,
but when you get to know Tony...

12
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:54,006
you'll understand why I said that.

13
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:57,093
Darling, I understand now
but that doesn't stop me from loving you.

14
00:02:58,262 --> 00:03:00,638
It's not as simple as that.

15
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:07,562
Tony's changed.

16
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:08,771
Thanks.

17
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:12,108
He's a completely different person
to the one I used to tell you about.

18
00:03:12,276 --> 00:03:14,110
Really? When did all this happen?

19
00:03:14,278 --> 00:03:16,445
That night I came to say goodbye.

20
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:19,574
When I left your apartment,
I came back here.

21
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:23,995
I sat down on the sofa and had a good cry.
And then I fell asleep.

22
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:26,622
And when I woke up,
there was Tony standing in the hall...

23
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:28,708
with all his bags and tennis rackets.

24
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:32,420
He just said he decided to give up tennis
and settle down to a job.

25
00:03:32,588 --> 00:03:34,380
- Just like that?
- Just like that.

26
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:38,718
Of course I didn't believe him at first,
but he meant it all right.

27
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:40,887
But he's been wonderful ever since.

28
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:42,847
I suppose that's when you stopped writing me?

29
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:45,808
Margot, is it?

30
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:48,853
Do you remember the letters
you wrote to me?

31
00:03:49,021 --> 00:03:50,563
Yes, I remember.

32
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:54,358
After I read them, I burned them.
I thought it best.

33
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:56,652
All except one.

34
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,738
You probably know the one I mean.

35
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:02,491
Yes, I think I do. What about it?

36
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:04,535
It was stolen.

37
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:12,043
One day Tony and I were going to spend
the weekend in the country with friends.

38
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:15,129
While we were waiting on the platform,
I noticed my handbag was missing...

39
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:16,714
and the letter was inside.

40
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:17,548
Where was this?

41
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:19,258
Victoria Station.

42
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:21,010
I thought I left it in the restaurant...

43
00:04:21,178 --> 00:04:22,929
but when I went back to look,
it had gone.

44
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:24,639
You mean you never found it?

45
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:27,016
I recovered the handbag
about two weeks later...

46
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:30,937
from the lost and found,
but the letter wasn't there.

47
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:34,732
And then about a week afterwards,
I received a note.

48
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,943
It told me what I had to do
to get the letter back.

49
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:39,320
Yes. Go ahead. Go on.

50
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:44,158
I was to draw £50 from my bank in £5 notes...

51
00:04:44,326 --> 00:04:47,286
and then change them for used £1 notes.

52
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:51,123
It said that if I went to the police
or told anyone else...

53
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,917
he would show the letter to my husband.

54
00:04:53,335 --> 00:04:54,293
You still have the note?

55
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:25,908
Printed, all capitals.
Anyone could have done this.

56
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:28,369
And two days later, I got this one.

57
00:05:28,537 --> 00:05:30,830
Both mailed in Brixton.

58
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:36,627
"Tie up the money in a package...

59
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:39,672
and mail to John S. King,
23 Newport Street, Brixton SW 9.

60
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,257
You'll get your letter by return."

61
00:05:41,425 --> 00:05:44,176
It's a little shop.
People use it as a forwarding address.

62
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,053
You didn't mail the money?

63
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:48,681
- Yes, but the letter was never returned.
- Margot.

64
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:51,017
So after waiting about two weeks,
I went there.

65
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,310
Said they'd never heard of a man
by that name.

66
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:55,855
And the parcel was still there,
it had never been opened.

67
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:58,441
Well, that's something, I suppose.
May I keep these?

68
00:05:58,608 --> 00:05:59,650
Yes, if you like.

69
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:01,444
I can't understand why you didn't tell me.

70
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:03,988
There wasn't anything you could do.

71
00:06:04,156 --> 00:06:06,657
You probably would've made me
tell Tony and the police.

72
00:06:06,825 --> 00:06:09,827
As it was only £50,
I thought I'd pay up and have done with it.

73
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:11,746
Margot, I better tell Tony about us tonight.

74
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:13,789
No, Mark, please, you mustn't.

75
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:18,002
You don't understand.
Tony's changed. Please.

76
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:23,215
I wish it was a year ago
when you came to say goodbye.

77
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:26,343
We were in the kitchen. I nearly said,
"I can't go through with this.

78
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:28,846
Let's find Tony and tell him all about it."

79
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:31,515
I believe you'd have done it then.

80
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:35,686
Well, I can see this is gonna be
a rough evening.

81
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:38,522
All of us saying nice things to each other.

82
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,194
Look, there's only one thing
you haven't explained.

83
00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:46,155
Why didn't you burn that letter too?

84
00:07:01,797 --> 00:07:04,131
There you are.
We thought you were never coming.

85
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:05,382
What have you been up to?

86
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:08,302
Oh, I'm sorry, but the boss blew in
just as I was leaving.

87
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:09,887
Tony, this is Mark Halliday.

88
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:11,263
- Hello, Mark.
- Tony, hello.

89
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:14,016
I'm terribly sorry to be so late.

90
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,685
How do you like it over here?

91
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:18,312
Oh, fine. Just fine, Tony.

92
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,523
Is this your first visit to London?

93
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:23,734
No, no. I was here a year ago for a vacation.

94
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:25,486
Oh, yes, that's right.
Margot told me.

95
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:27,613
You, uh....
You write for the radio, don't you?

96
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:31,200
- No, television, for my sins.
- Darling, did you reserve a table?

97
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:33,035
- Yes, 7:00.
- Well, come on then--

98
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:35,246
Oh, darling, a slight alteration in plans.

99
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:37,581
- Oh, now don't say you can't go.
- I'm afraid so.

100
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:39,834
Old man Burgess is flying to Brussels on Sunday...

101
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:42,128
and I have to get my monthly report in
by tomorrow.

102
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,963
Well, can't you do it when we get back?

103
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:47,716
I'm afraid not. It'll take hours.
I shall have to fake half of it as it is.

104
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:49,093
But....

105
00:07:49,261 --> 00:07:51,846
Could you join us after the theater?
We might go somewhere.

106
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:53,889
Why don't you give me a ring at intermission?

107
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:55,391
If I'm inspired, I might make it.

108
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:56,767
- Well, do try.
- All right.

109
00:07:56,935 --> 00:07:58,811
I'll just get my things, Mark.

110
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:01,814
- Oh, here are the tickets.
- Oh, thanks, Tony.

111
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:03,649
I'm afraid this is terribly rude of me.

112
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:05,784
Not at all.
I'm just sorry you can't come.

113
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:07,111
You must come to dinner.

114
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:08,821
- Thanks, I'd like that.
- By the way...

115
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:11,824
- what are you doing tomorrow night?
- Saturday? Nothing I know of.

116
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:14,451
- How'd you like to come to a stag party?
- A stag party?

117
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:17,204
Yes. Some American boys
have been playing tennis all over.

118
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:19,331
We're giving them a sort of farewell dinner.

119
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,000
Well, I'm not much of a tennis player.

120
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:23,210
That doesn't matter.
You know New York and all that.

121
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:25,838
- Mark's coming to the party tomorrow.
- Oh, good.

122
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:28,048
Well, you better drop in here first
and have a drink.

123
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:31,093
- That's the idea.
- Yes. All right. I'll try and get a taxi.

124
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:33,637
Oh, no. We can usually pick one up.

125
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:35,681
So long, darling.

126
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:37,057
Enjoy yourself.

127
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:39,435
- So long, Tony.
- Good night.

128
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:41,937
Oh, Mark?

129
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:43,230
Yes?

130
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:45,649
Sell the extra ticket.
Have a drink on the proceeds.

131
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:47,902
- All right, Tony, we'll try.
- Have a good time.

132
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,361
Thanks. Night.

133
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:25,189
- <i>Hello.</i>
- Hello. Hampstead 7899?

134
00:09:25,357 --> 00:09:27,107
- <i>Yes.</i>
- Could I speak to Captain Lesgate?

135
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:28,067
<i>Speaking.</i>

136
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:30,778
Oh, good evening. You don't know me.
My name is Fisher.

137
00:09:30,946 --> 00:09:32,529
I understand you have a car for sale.

138
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:34,031
<i>Oh, yes, an American car.</i>

139
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:36,533
Yes, I saw it at your garage.
How much are you asking?

140
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:38,827
- <i>Eleven hundred.</i>
- Eleven hundred, I see.

141
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:41,997
Well, it certainly looks just the job for me.
But I don't like that price.

142
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:43,916
<i>Well, I didn't like it when I bought it.</i>

143
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:45,834
Now, when can we meet? 

144
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:47,962
<i>Well, now, how about tomorrow afternoon?</i>

145
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:49,755
I'm afraid I can't manage that.

146
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:53,217
Uh, no, I can't,
and I'm going to Liverpool on Sunday.

147
00:09:53,385 --> 00:09:54,677
I was rather hoping....

148
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:56,845
I say, you couldn't come around
to my flat tonight?

149
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,597
- <i>Where is it?</i>
- Maida Vale.

150
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:01,308
I'd call on you,
only I've twisted my knee rather badly.

151
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:03,519
<i>Oh, I'm sorry. Well, what's your address?</i>

152
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:04,895
61-A Charrington Gardens.

153
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:06,981
- <i>Harrington? Oh.</i>
- Oh, no, no. Charrington.

154
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:09,650
Turn left at the underground.
It's about a two minutes' walk.

155
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:11,193
<i>I'll be there in about an hour.</i>

156
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:14,571
That's extremely good of you.
Oh, by the way, will you be bringing the car?

157
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:16,198
<i>Oh, I'm afraid I can't--</i>

158
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:18,409
Well, that doesn't matter.
I had a good look at it.

159
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:21,203
As you might bring the registration book
and any necessary papers.

160
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:22,037
<i>Yes, of course.</i>

161
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:24,331
I don't see why we couldn't
settle this thing here...

162
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:26,250
provided you drop the price sufficiently.

163
00:10:26,418 --> 00:10:28,377
<i>Oh, I'm afraid that's out of the question.</i>

164
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:30,546
Well, we'll see what a couple of drinks can do.

165
00:10:31,923 --> 00:10:32,881
Uh, goodbye.

166
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:34,258
<i>Goodbye.</i>

167
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:17,009
- Mr. Fisher?
- Yes. Captain Lesgate?

168
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:18,135
- Yes.
- Won't you come in?

169
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:19,762
Thank you.

170
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:22,014
It's very good of you.

171
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:24,433
Let me have your coat.

172
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:28,312
- Have any difficulty finding your way?
- No. None at all.

173
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,190
Do sit down. How about a drink?

174
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:34,276
You know, I can't help thinking
I've seen you before somewhere.

175
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:36,320
You know, it's funny
you should mention that.

176
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:38,572
The moment I opened the door, I....

177
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:41,742
Wait a minute. Lesgate?

178
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:46,121
You're not Lesgate. Swann.
C.J. Swann. Or was it C.A?

179
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:50,667
C.A. Well, you've got a better memory
than I have.

180
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:52,795
Fisher. When did we meet?

181
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:54,421
- Weren't you at Cambridge?
- Yes.

182
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:57,174
Must be 20 years ago.
You wouldn't remember me.

183
00:11:57,342 --> 00:11:59,051
I only came your last year.

184
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:00,344
Well, what a coincidence.

185
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:02,888
Yes, this calls for a special drink.

186
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:05,391
I was planning to palm you off
with an indifferent port...

187
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:08,519
but let's see what we have here.
How about this?

188
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:09,978
Perfect.

189
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:13,982
By the way,
how do you know my car's for sale?

190
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,818
Your garage told me.

191
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,694
That's odd. I didn't mention it to anyone.

192
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:20,614
I was stopping for a fill-up
and I told them I was looking for a car.

193
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:23,784
They gave me your phone number.
I say, it is for sale, isn't it?

194
00:12:23,952 --> 00:12:26,328
- Well, of course.
- Good. I refuse to discuss the price...

195
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:27,955
until you've had three brandies.

196
00:12:28,123 --> 00:12:30,707
Well, I warn you, I drive a hard bargain,
drunk or sober.

197
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,126
So do I.

198
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:38,006
You know, I think I must have seen you somewhere
since we left Cambridge.

199
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:39,758
Ever been to Wimbledon?

200
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:45,097
That's it. Wendice. Tony Wendice.

201
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:46,807
What's all this about Fisher?

202
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:48,434
What's all this about Lesgate?

203
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:52,312
Would you like a cigar?

204
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,315
No, thanks. I'll just stick to my pipe.

205
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:57,192
That's one habit you've changed.

206
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,527
- Oh?
- I remember, at college...

207
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:01,363
you always used to smoke
rather expensive cigars.

208
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:05,033
Wait a minute, I think
I have a picture of you here somewhere.

209
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:06,660
Yes.

210
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:09,621
Yes. Here's one...

211
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:12,166
taken at a reunion dinner.

212
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:13,500
There you are.

213
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:15,377
With the biggest cigar in the business.

214
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:18,755
Well, that's the first and last reunion
I ever went to.

215
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:20,799
What a murderous thug I look.

216
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:22,718
Yes, you do, rather.

217
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:27,014
Of course I always remember you
because of the college ball.

218
00:13:27,182 --> 00:13:28,640
You were the treasurer, weren't you?

219
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:29,850
Honorary treasurer.

220
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:31,935
I used to organize the beastly things.

221
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:33,896
Yes. Some of the ticket money was stolen...

222
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:36,732
- wasn't it?
- That's right. Almost £100.

223
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:40,569
I'd left it in a cashbox in my study
and in the morning it had gone.

224
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:42,196
It was the college porter, of course.

225
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:44,114
Yes, of course. Poor old Alfred.

226
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:45,532
He never could back a winner.

227
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:48,368
They found the cashbox in his back garden.

228
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:49,578
But not the money.

229
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:53,540
Twenty years ago.

230
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,167
What are you doing nowadays?

231
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:56,752
I deal in property.

232
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,254
I say, I don't follow tennis closely.
Do you still play?

233
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:01,673
No, I've given up tennis,
or rather, tennis gave me up.

234
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,927
One has to earn a living sometime,
and I had a good run for my money.

235
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:06,595
Went round the world three times.

236
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:09,515
- What are you doing now?
- I sell sports equipment.

237
00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:12,392
It's not very lucrative,
but it gives me plenty of spare time.

238
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,521
Well, I see you manage to run
a very comfortable place.

239
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,523
My wife has some money of her own.

240
00:14:17,941 --> 00:14:21,360
Otherwise, I should hardly feel
like blowing £1000 on your car.

241
00:14:21,928 --> 00:14:22,986
1100. 

242
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:26,615
You know, people with capital
don't realize how lucky they are.

243
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:28,867
I'm almost resigned to living
on what I can earn.

244
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:30,786
Well, you can always marry for money.

245
00:14:30,954 --> 00:14:32,913
I suppose some people
make a business out of that.

246
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:36,124
- I know I did.
- Why do you think she married you?

247
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:37,668
Well, I was a tennis star.

248
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:40,754
You've given up tennis.
She hasn't left you.

249
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:42,506
She nearly did.

250
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,633
After we married, I played...

251
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:46,510
in championships and took Margot with me.

252
00:14:46,678 --> 00:14:48,845
She didn't like it much,
and when we got back...

253
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:52,683
she tried to make me give up tennis
and play husband instead.

254
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,268
In the end, we compromised.

255
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:56,728
I went alone to America
for the grass-court season...

256
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,731
and returned after the national championships.

257
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:03,068
I soon realized that a lot had happened
while I was away.

258
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:05,988
For one thing,
she wasn't in love with me anymore.

259
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:10,075
There were phone calls which would end abruptly
if I happened to walk in.

260
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:13,954
There was an old school friend
used to visit from time to time.

261
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:18,083
One day we had a row. I wanted to play
in the covered-court tournament...

262
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:20,794
and as usual, she didn't want me to go.

263
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:26,258
I was in the bedroom. The phone rang.
It all sounded pretty urgent.

264
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:29,177
After that, she seemed keen
that I play in the tournament after all.

265
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:32,222
So I packed my kit into the car and drove off.

266
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:37,728
I parked the car two streets away,
walked back in my tracks.

267
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:41,398
Ten minutes later,
she came out of this house and took a taxi.

268
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:43,233
I took another.

269
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:46,445
Her old school friend lived
in a studio in Chelsea.

270
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:48,363
I could see them through the studio window...

271
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:50,866
as he cooked spaghetti over a gas ring.

272
00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:54,703
They didn't say much.
They just looked very natural together.

273
00:15:55,038 --> 00:15:58,248
You know, it's funny how you can tell
when people are in love.

274
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:01,001
I went for a walk.

275
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:04,630
I began to wonder what would happen
if she left me.

276
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:07,966
I'd have to find some way
of earning a living to begin with.

277
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:11,762
I suddenly realized how much I'd grown
to depend on her.

278
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:15,349
All these expensive tastes I'd acquired
while I was at the top.

279
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:19,394
And now big tennis had finished with me,
and so apparently had my wife.

280
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:22,397
I can't ever remember being so scared.

281
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:25,525
I dropped into a pub
and had a couple of drinks.

282
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:30,197
As I sat in the corner,
I thought of all sorts of things.

283
00:16:30,365 --> 00:16:32,658
I thought of three different ways of killing him.

284
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:34,993
I even thought of killing her.

285
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:37,913
That seemed a far more sensible idea.

286
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:41,208
And just as I was working out how I could do it,
I suddenly saw something...

287
00:16:41,376 --> 00:16:44,378
which completely changed my mind.

288
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:50,342
I didn't go to that tournament after all.

289
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:54,137
When I got back, she was sitting
exactly where you are now.

290
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:58,266
And I told her I decided to give up tennis
and look after her instead.

291
00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:00,519
Well?

292
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:03,730
Well, as things turned out,
I needn't have got so worked up after all.

293
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:07,693
Apparently that spaghetti evening
had been a sort of a fond farewell.

294
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,070
The boyfriend had been called
back to New York.

295
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:11,446
- Ah, an American?
- Yes.

296
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,490
There were long letters from there.

297
00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:17,744
They usually arrived on Thursdays.
And she burned them all except one.

298
00:17:17,912 --> 00:17:20,497
That one she used to transfer
from handbag to handbag.

299
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:22,499
It was always with her.

300
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:26,670
That letter became an obsession with me.
I had to find out what was in it.

301
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:28,755
And finally I did.

302
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:30,632
That letter made very interesting reading.

303
00:17:31,426 --> 00:17:33,635
- Do you mean you stole it?
- Yes.

304
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:36,680
I even wrote her two anonymous notes
offering to sell it back.

305
00:17:36,848 --> 00:17:37,931
Why?

306
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:41,143
I was hoping it would make her come
and tell me all about him...

307
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,185
but it didn't.

308
00:17:42,937 --> 00:17:44,980
So I kept the letter.

309
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:49,067
Why are you telling me all this?

310
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:51,778
Because you're the only person
I can trust.

311
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:59,745
Anyway, that did it.
It must have put the fear of God into them...

312
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,288
because the letters stopped...

313
00:18:01,456 --> 00:18:03,665
and we lived happily ever after.

314
00:18:04,167 --> 00:18:06,543
It was funny to think
that just a year ago...

315
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:10,255
I sat in that Knightsbridge pub
actually planning to murder her.

316
00:18:10,673 --> 00:18:12,424
And I might have done it...

317
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:15,844
if I hadn't seen something
that changed my mind.

318
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:18,221
Well? What did you see?

319
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:20,807
I saw you.

320
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:27,355
What was so odd about that?

321
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:28,690
The coincidence.

322
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:31,109
Only a week before,
I'd been to a reunion dinner...

323
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:33,195
and the fellas were talking about you.

324
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:36,740
How you'd been court-martialed
during the war, a year in prison.

325
00:18:36,908 --> 00:18:38,116
That was news.

326
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:41,661
Mind you, at college, we'd all said
that old Swann would end up in jail.

327
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:43,955
That cashbox, I suppose.

328
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,207
Well, what about it?

329
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:49,044
Oh, my dear fellow,
everybody knew you took that money.

330
00:18:49,212 --> 00:18:51,296
Poor old Alfred.

331
00:18:56,886 --> 00:18:58,804
Thanks very much for the drink.

332
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,972
Interesting, hearing about
your matrimonial affairs.

333
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,183
I take it you won't be wanting
that car after all.

334
00:19:03,351 --> 00:19:05,894
Don't you want me to tell you
why I brought you here?

335
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,689
Yes, I think you'd better.

336
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:12,400
It was when I saw you in that pub
that it happened.

337
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:14,694
Suddenly everything became quite clear.

338
00:19:16,948 --> 00:19:19,282
Only a few months before,
Margot and I had made our wills...

339
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:20,450
quite short affairs...

340
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:23,161
leaving everything we had to each other
in case of accidents.

341
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:27,874
Hers worked out at just over £90,000.
Investments mostly.

342
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:29,751
All a little too easy to get at.

343
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,171
And that was dangerous
as they'd be bound to suspect me.

344
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:37,259
I needed an alibi, a very good one.

345
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:39,386
Then I saw you.

346
00:19:39,554 --> 00:19:42,305
I often wondered what happened to people
when they came out of prison.

347
00:19:42,473 --> 00:19:45,851
People like you, I mean.
Can they get jobs?

348
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:51,231
Do old friends rally round?
Suppose they'd never had any friends.

349
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:54,442
I became so curious to know
that I followed you.

350
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,736
I followed you home that night.

351
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:59,906
And-- Would you mind
passing me your glass, old boy?

352
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,452
Thank you. Thank you very much.
And I've been following you ever since.

353
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,620
Why?

354
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:08,456
I was hoping that sooner or later
I might catch you at something...

355
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:09,958
and be able to, uh....

356
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:13,003
- Blackmail me?
- Influence you.

357
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,630
After a couple of weeks,
I got to know your routine...

358
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:17,257
and that made it a lot easier.

359
00:20:17,425 --> 00:20:20,093
- Rather dour work.
- To begin with, yes.

360
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:22,304
But you know how it is.
You take up a hobby...

361
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:25,348
and the more you get to know it,
the more fascinating it becomes.

362
00:20:25,516 --> 00:20:27,309
You became quite fascinating.

363
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:31,354
In fact, there were times when I felt
that you almost belonged to me.

364
00:20:31,522 --> 00:20:33,273
That must have been interesting.

365
00:20:33,441 --> 00:20:36,109
You used to go to the dog racing
Mondays and Thursdays.

366
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:38,737
I even took it up myself,
just to be near you.

367
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:41,907
You'd changed your name to Adams.

368
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:44,576
Yes. I got bored with Swann.
Any crime in that?

369
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:46,745
No, no. None whatever.

370
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:49,539
In fact, there was nothing
really illegal about you.

371
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:51,917
I got quite discouraged.

372
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:54,711
Then one day,
you disappeared from your lodgings.

373
00:20:54,879 --> 00:20:58,673
I phoned your landlady.
I said Mr. Adams owed me £5.

374
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:00,091
But apparently that was nothing.

375
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:05,055
Mr. Adams owed her six weeks' rent
and her best lodger £55.

376
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,766
And Mr. Adams had been
such a nice gentleman.

377
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:10,018
That's what seemed to upset her most.

378
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:13,396
Yes. That always seems to upset them most.

379
00:21:13,564 --> 00:21:15,607
I say, old boy,
if you want another drink...

380
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:17,901
do you mind putting on these gloves?

381
00:21:18,069 --> 00:21:20,028
Now, where were we?
Oh, yes, I'd lost you...

382
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:22,489
and then I found you one day
at the dog racing.

383
00:21:22,657 --> 00:21:25,867
And I tailed you home
to your new lodgings in Belsize Park.

384
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:28,370
There Mr. Adams became Mr. Wilson.

385
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:31,498
Mr. Wilson left Belsize Park
owing 16 weeks' rent...

386
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:35,752
and somewhat richer
for a brief encounter with a Miss Wallace.

387
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:39,047
You used to take Miss Wallace out
on Wednesdays and Sundays.

388
00:21:39,215 --> 00:21:41,591
She certainly was in love with you,
wasn't she?

389
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:45,679
I suppose she thought you were growing
that handsome mustache to please her.

390
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:47,764
Poor Miss Wallace.

391
00:21:47,932 --> 00:21:50,183
This is all very interesting.
Do go on.

392
00:21:50,351 --> 00:21:54,813
July, August, September.
Apartment 127, Carlisle Court.

393
00:21:54,981 --> 00:21:56,815
Occupant, a Mrs. Van Dorn.

394
00:21:56,983 --> 00:22:01,236
Her late husband left her two hotels
and a large apartment house, furnished.

395
00:22:01,404 --> 00:22:04,030
What a base to operate from, Captain Lesgate.

396
00:22:04,198 --> 00:22:07,075
The only trouble is,
she does rather enjoy being courted...

397
00:22:07,243 --> 00:22:08,910
and she's so very expensive.

398
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:12,956
Perhaps that's why you've been trying
to sell her car for over a month.

399
00:22:13,124 --> 00:22:15,375
Mrs. Van Dorn asked me to sell it for her.

400
00:22:15,543 --> 00:22:18,461
I know. I called her up
just before you arrived here.

401
00:22:18,629 --> 00:22:20,046
She only wanted 800.

402
00:22:24,427 --> 00:22:25,802
Where's the nearest police station?

403
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:27,971
Opposite the church. Two minutes' walk.

404
00:22:28,514 --> 00:22:31,599
- Suppose I walk there now.
- What would you tell them?

405
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:32,600
Everything.

406
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:33,852
Everything?

407
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,062
All about Mr. Adams and Mr. Wilson?

408
00:22:37,231 --> 00:22:40,483
I should simply tell them
that you're trying to blackmail me into--

409
00:22:40,651 --> 00:22:41,943
Into?

410
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:44,404
Murdering your wife.

411
00:22:45,156 --> 00:22:47,157
I almost wish you would.
When she heard that...

412
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:49,242
we'd have the biggest laugh of our lives.

413
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:51,578
- Aren't you forgetting something?
- Am I?

414
00:22:51,746 --> 00:22:54,330
- You've told me quite a lot tonight.
- What of it?

415
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:57,459
Suppose I tell them how you followed her
to that studio in Chelsea...

416
00:22:57,626 --> 00:22:59,961
and watched them cooking spaghetti,
and all that rubbish?

417
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:02,964
- Will that ring a bell?
- Oh, it certainly would.

418
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:04,883
They'd assume you followed her yourself.

419
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:07,677
- Me? Why should I?
- Why should you steal her handbag?

420
00:23:07,845 --> 00:23:09,846
Why should you write her
all those blackmail notes?

421
00:23:10,681 --> 00:23:15,226
Can you prove you didn't?
You certainly can't prove I did.

422
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:17,604
It'd be a straight case
of your word against mine.

423
00:23:18,314 --> 00:23:21,066
That would puzzle them, wouldn't it?
What could you say?

424
00:23:21,776 --> 00:23:24,611
I shall simply say
that you came here tonight half-drunk...

425
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:26,196
and, uh, tried to borrow money...

426
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:28,406
on the strength
that we were at college together.

427
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:30,408
When I refused, you mentioned something...

428
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:32,452
about a letter belonging to my wife.

429
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:35,455
As far as I could make out,
you tried to sell it to me.

430
00:23:35,623 --> 00:23:38,875
I gave you what money I had
and you gave me the letter.

431
00:23:39,043 --> 00:23:41,461
It has your fingerprints on it, remember?

432
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:46,925
Then you said if I went to the police...

433
00:23:47,093 --> 00:23:50,470
you'd tell some crazy story
about my wanting you to murder my wife.

434
00:23:51,097 --> 00:23:55,809
But before you go any further, old boy,
do consider the inconvenience.

435
00:23:55,976 --> 00:24:00,563
You see, I'm quite well-known.
And there'd be pictures of you as well.

436
00:24:00,731 --> 00:24:03,858
And sooner or later, there'd be
a deputation of landladies and lodgers...

437
00:24:04,026 --> 00:24:06,778
who would step forward
to testify to your character.

438
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:11,616
And someone is almost certain
to have seen you with Miss Wallace.

439
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:15,328
You were careful not to be seen
around with her, I noticed.

440
00:24:15,496 --> 00:24:19,374
You usually met in out-of-the-way places
where you wouldn't be recognized...

441
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:23,086
like the little tea shop in Pimlico.

442
00:24:23,254 --> 00:24:25,004
That was her idea, not mine.

443
00:24:25,339 --> 00:24:27,048
Yes, it was a bit crummy, wasn't it?

444
00:24:27,216 --> 00:24:29,676
Hardly the place to take Mrs. Van Dorn.

445
00:24:29,844 --> 00:24:33,555
By the way, does Mrs. Van Dorn
know about Mr. Adams and Mr. Wilson...

446
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:35,265
and Miss Wallace?

447
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:38,059
You were planning to marry Mrs. Van Dorn,
weren't you?

448
00:24:38,227 --> 00:24:40,186
- Smart, aren't you?
- No, not really.

449
00:24:40,354 --> 00:24:44,149
I've just had time to think things out,
put myself in your position.

450
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:46,818
That's why I know you're going to agree.

451
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:49,195
What makes you think I'll agree?

452
00:24:49,363 --> 00:24:52,574
For the same reason that a donkey
with a stick behind him and a carrot in front...

453
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:55,577
always goes forwards and not backwards.

454
00:24:56,078 --> 00:25:00,373
- Tell me about the carrot.
- One thousand pounds in cash.

455
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:01,958
For a murder?

456
00:25:02,126 --> 00:25:05,837
For a few minutes' work, that's all it is.
And no risk, I guarantee.

457
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:09,966
That ought to appeal to you.
You've been skating on pretty thin ice.

458
00:25:10,134 --> 00:25:12,064
I don't know what you're talking about.

459
00:25:12,065 --> 00:25:14,429
You ought to know.
It was in all the papers.

460
00:25:14,597 --> 00:25:17,640
Middle-aged woman found dead
due to an overdose of something.

461
00:25:17,808 --> 00:25:19,976
She had been taking the stuff
for quite some time...

462
00:25:20,144 --> 00:25:21,603
and nobody knows where she got it.

463
00:25:22,313 --> 00:25:24,189
But we know, don't we?

464
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:27,150
Poor Miss Wallace.

465
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:33,406
This £1000. Where is it?

466
00:25:34,909 --> 00:25:37,577
It's in a small attaché case in a checkroom.

467
00:25:37,745 --> 00:25:38,912
Where?

468
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:40,580
Somewhere in London.

469
00:25:41,165 --> 00:25:42,582
Of course we don't meet again.

470
00:25:43,417 --> 00:25:45,084
As soon as you've delivered the goods...

471
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:48,838
I shall mail you the checkroom ticket
and the key to the case.

472
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:51,841
You can take this £100 on account.

473
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:58,640
The police would only have to trace
one of these notes back to you...

474
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:00,725
to hang us both from the same rope.

475
00:26:01,018 --> 00:26:02,143
They won't.

476
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:04,938
For a whole year,
I've been cashing an extra £20 a week.

477
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:09,400
Always in fivers.
I then change them for those at my leisure.

478
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:11,861
Let me see your bank statement?

479
00:26:12,029 --> 00:26:13,404
By all means.

480
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:20,036
Don't touch.

481
00:26:24,792 --> 00:26:26,501
Turn back a page.

482
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:35,885
Ah. Your balance has dropped
by over £1000 during the year.

483
00:26:36,053 --> 00:26:37,637
Suppose the police ask you about that.

484
00:26:37,805 --> 00:26:40,014
I go dog racing twice a week.

485
00:26:40,182 --> 00:26:41,724
They'll check your bookmaker.

486
00:26:41,892 --> 00:26:44,018
Like you, I always bet on the tout.

487
00:26:44,186 --> 00:26:45,728
Satisfied?

488
00:26:48,399 --> 00:26:49,983
When would this take place?

489
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,359
Tomorrow night.

490
00:26:51,527 --> 00:26:53,611
Tomorrow? Not a chance.

491
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:55,446
I've gotta think this over.

492
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:59,492
It has to be tomorrow.
I've arranged things that way.

493
00:27:00,244 --> 00:27:01,619
Where?

494
00:27:02,496 --> 00:27:04,247
Approximately where you're standing now.

495
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:07,625
How?

496
00:27:07,793 --> 00:27:10,211
Tomorrow evening, Halliday,
the American boyfriend, and I...

497
00:27:10,379 --> 00:27:13,673
will go out to a stag party.
She'll stay here.

498
00:27:13,841 --> 00:27:16,759
She'll go to bed early and listen to
<i>Saturday Night Theatre</i> on the radio.

499
00:27:16,927 --> 00:27:18,636
She always does when I'm out.

500
00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:20,305
At exactly three minutes to 11...

501
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,765
you'll enter the house
through the street door.

502
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:25,268
You'll find the key to this door...

503
00:27:28,314 --> 00:27:30,565
under the stair carpet here.

504
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:33,401
- The fifth step.
- That's the one.

505
00:27:34,403 --> 00:27:36,654
Go straight to the window...

506
00:27:37,823 --> 00:27:39,073
and hide behind the curtains.

507
00:27:40,034 --> 00:27:41,117
At exactly 11:00...

508
00:27:41,285 --> 00:27:43,953
I shall go to the telephone in the hotel
to call my boss.

509
00:27:44,121 --> 00:27:48,291
I shall dial the wrong number, this number.
That's all I shall do.

510
00:27:48,459 --> 00:27:49,751
When the phone rings...

511
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:52,920
you'll see the light go on
under her bedroom door.

512
00:27:53,422 --> 00:27:56,299
When she opens it,
the light will stream across the room.

513
00:27:56,467 --> 00:27:59,302
So don't move until she answers the phone.

514
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:02,096
There must be as little noise as possible.

515
00:28:02,264 --> 00:28:04,140
After you've finished...

516
00:28:04,308 --> 00:28:07,268
pick up the phone
and give me a soft whistle, and hang up.

517
00:28:07,436 --> 00:28:10,021
Don't speak, whatever you do.
I shan't say a word.

518
00:28:10,189 --> 00:28:13,066
When I hear your whistle,
I shall hang up and redial...

519
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:15,151
but the correct number this time.

520
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:19,113
I shall then talk to my boss as if
nothing had happened and return to the party.

521
00:28:19,281 --> 00:28:21,032
Well, what happens next? Go on.

522
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,284
You'll see the suitcase here.

523
00:28:23,452 --> 00:28:25,620
It contains some clothes of mine
for the cleaners.

524
00:28:25,788 --> 00:28:29,290
Open it and tip the clothes out
onto the floor.

525
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:32,168
Fill it with a cigarette box
and some of these cups.

526
00:28:32,336 --> 00:28:35,380
Close the lid, but don't snap the locks.

527
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:37,757
Then leave the suitcase there
just as it is now.

528
00:28:37,925 --> 00:28:40,176
- Ah, as if I'd left in a hurry.
- That's the idea.

529
00:28:40,344 --> 00:28:41,844
Now the window.

530
00:28:42,388 --> 00:28:45,973
If it's locked,
unlock it and leave it open.

531
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:49,102
Then go out exactly the same way
you came in.

532
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:51,437
- By this door?
- Yes.

533
00:28:51,605 --> 00:28:53,564
And here's the most important thing:

534
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:57,026
As you go out, return the key
to the place where you found it.

535
00:28:57,194 --> 00:28:59,445
- Under the stair carpet?
- Yes.

536
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:02,115
Yes, but what exactly
is supposed to have happened?

537
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:06,035
They'll assume you came in by the window.

538
00:29:06,203 --> 00:29:07,745
You thought the apartment was empty...

539
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:10,289
so you took the suitcase
and went to work.

540
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:14,836
She heard something.
She switched on her light.

541
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:18,256
You saw the light under the door
and hid behind the curtains.

542
00:29:18,424 --> 00:29:22,385
When she came in here,
you attacked her before she could scream.

543
00:29:23,053 --> 00:29:25,346
When you realized you'd actually killed her...

544
00:29:25,514 --> 00:29:27,306
you panicked, bolted through the garden...

545
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:29,684
- and left the loot behind you.
- Just a minute.

546
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:33,688
I'm supposed to have come in
through these windows.

547
00:29:34,648 --> 00:29:37,358
- Suppose they'd been locked.
- It wouldn't matter.

548
00:29:37,526 --> 00:29:40,278
You see, she often walks around the garden
before she goes to bed...

549
00:29:40,446 --> 00:29:43,364
and she usually forgets to lock up
when she gets back.

550
00:29:43,657 --> 00:29:45,533
That's what I shall tell the police.

551
00:29:45,701 --> 00:29:48,161
Yes, but she may say that....

552
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:52,790
But she isn't going to say anything, is she?

553
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:59,922
All right. I leave the apartment.

554
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:04,177
I put the key back under the stair carpet
and go out by the street door.

555
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:07,430
Suppose the street door's locked.
How do I get in in the first place?

556
00:30:07,598 --> 00:30:09,140
The street door is never locked.

557
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:11,559
- What time will you get back?
- About 12.

558
00:30:11,727 --> 00:30:14,437
I'll bring Halliday back for a nightcap
so we'll find her together.

559
00:30:14,605 --> 00:30:16,814
And we shall have been together
since we left her...

560
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:18,983
and there's my alibi.

561
00:30:33,749 --> 00:30:35,791
- You've forgotten something.
- What?

562
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:38,669
When you get back with
what's-his-name, Halliday...

563
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:41,797
- how will you get into the apartment?
- I shall let myself in.

564
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:43,925
But your key will be under
the stair carpet.

565
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:46,260
He'll see you getting it out.
It'll give the show away.

566
00:30:46,428 --> 00:30:49,972
No. It won't be my key under the carpet,
it'll be hers.

567
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:52,683
I shall take it from her handbag
and hide it out there...

568
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:54,685
just before I leave the flat.

569
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:57,522
She's not going out,
so she won't miss it.

570
00:30:57,689 --> 00:31:01,651
When I come back with Halliday,
I'll use my own key to let us in.

571
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:05,154
Then while he's out searching the garden
or something...

572
00:31:05,322 --> 00:31:08,574
I'll take the key from under the carpet
and return it to her handbag...

573
00:31:08,742 --> 00:31:10,326
before the police arrive.

574
00:31:10,494 --> 00:31:12,203
How many keys are there to this door?

575
00:31:12,371 --> 00:31:13,788
Just hers and mine.

576
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,006
Maida Vale Z499.

577
00:31:24,174 --> 00:31:26,717
- <i>Tony, it's me.</i>
- Oh, hello, darling. How's it going?

578
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:29,804
<i>Wonderfully. It's really a splendid play.</i>

579
00:31:29,972 --> 00:31:33,683
- <i>We're enjoying every minute.</i>
- Oh, I'm sorry. I mean, I'm glad.

580
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:35,434
<i>You will join us, won't you?</i>

581
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:38,062
Well, I don't think so.
I hardly seem to have started.

582
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:40,481
Oh, darling, just a moment,
I think someone's at the door.

583
00:31:41,649 --> 00:31:43,943
You can be seen from the bedroom window.

584
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:49,115
Sorry, darling. False alarm.
Look, why don't you take Mark to Gerry's?

585
00:31:49,283 --> 00:31:51,784
- <i>How do we get in?</i>
- Well, just mention my name.

586
00:31:51,952 --> 00:31:54,579
I don't know about the band,
but the food's good.

587
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:56,789
By the way, Maureen called up
just after you left...

588
00:31:56,957 --> 00:31:59,292
and wants us for dinner on Wednesday.

589
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:01,919
But you've got something written
in your diary for Wednesday...

590
00:32:02,087 --> 00:32:05,298
and I can't read your writing.
Looks like Al Bentall.

591
00:32:06,133 --> 00:32:08,092
Who's he, another one of your boyfriends?

592
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,428
<i>Albert Hall, you idiot.</i>

593
00:32:10,596 --> 00:32:12,888
Oh, the Albert Hall, of course.

594
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,849
I'm so glad we don't have to go to Maureen's.

595
00:32:15,017 --> 00:32:16,350
She's such a filthy cook.

596
00:32:16,518 --> 00:32:18,227
<i>Oh, there's the bell. I must fly.</i>

597
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:20,730
All right, dear. Enjoy yourself.

598
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:26,420
Tony, don't make that martini too watery.

599
00:33:28,882 --> 00:33:32,385
Oh, now, where's the picture
of the maharaja?

600
00:33:33,345 --> 00:33:35,763
Darling, when are you gonna finish pasting
in those clippings?

601
00:33:35,931 --> 00:33:39,225
Oh, I shall find time one of these days.
Oh, here it is.

602
00:33:39,393 --> 00:33:41,894
This is the maharaja. Isn't he dreamy?

603
00:33:42,062 --> 00:33:44,647
He had four Rolls-Royces
and enough jewels to sink a battleship...

604
00:33:44,815 --> 00:33:46,607
but all he wanted was to play at Wimbledon.

605
00:33:46,775 --> 00:33:48,443
The poor darling. He was so shortsighted,

606
00:33:48,444 --> 00:33:50,194
he could barely see the end of the racket...

607
00:33:50,362 --> 00:33:51,320
let alone the ball.

608
00:33:51,488 --> 00:33:54,073
You know, you should, um....
Thanks, Tony.

609
00:33:54,241 --> 00:33:57,368
- You should write a book about all this.
- Why don't you two collaborate?

610
00:33:57,536 --> 00:33:59,495
A detective novel with a tennis...

611
00:33:59,663 --> 00:34:01,163
- background.
- What about it, Mark?

612
00:34:01,331 --> 00:34:03,082
Would you provide me
with the perfect murder?

613
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:04,625
Nothing I'd like better.

614
00:34:04,793 --> 00:34:06,502
How do you write a detective story?

615
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:10,214
Well, you forget detection and concentrate on crime. 
Crime's the thing.

616
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:13,134
Then you imagine you're going to steal
something or murder somebody.

617
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:15,302
Oh, is that how you do it? Interesting.

618
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:18,723
Yes, I usually put myself
in the criminal's shoes and ask myself, um:

619
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:19,932
"What do I do next?"

620
00:34:20,601 --> 00:34:22,601
Do you really believe in the perfect murder?

621
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:25,896
Mm. Yes, absolutely. On paper, that is.

622
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:28,441
And I think I could plan one better
than most people...

623
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:32,695
- but I doubt if I could carry it out.
- Oh? Why not?

624
00:34:32,863 --> 00:34:35,239
Well, in stories, things turn out
the way the author wants.

625
00:34:35,407 --> 00:34:37,658
And in real life, they don't always.

626
00:34:37,826 --> 00:34:39,326
- Hm.
- No, I'm afraid my murders...

627
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:40,536
would be like my bridge.

628
00:34:40,704 --> 00:34:44,206
I'd make a stupid mistake and never realize
till I found everybody was looking at me.

629
00:34:44,374 --> 00:34:45,583
- We better drink up, Mark.
- Yes.

630
00:34:45,751 --> 00:34:48,878
- What are you doing tomorrow?
- Mm. Nothing I know of.

631
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:50,963
Why don't we all drive down
to Windsor for lunch?

632
00:34:51,131 --> 00:34:53,340
That's a good idea.
Come along early, but not too early.

633
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:55,676
- We may be nursing a hangover.
- How about 11?

634
00:34:55,844 --> 00:34:56,802
Fine.

635
00:34:56,970 --> 00:34:58,679
We'll have lunch at the King's Head.

636
00:34:58,847 --> 00:34:59,805
Is that in Windsor?

637
00:34:59,973 --> 00:35:01,682
- No, it's just outside.
- Oh.

638
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:06,395
Did I lend you my latchkey?
I can't seem to find it anywhere.

639
00:35:06,563 --> 00:35:08,564
I don't know.
I may have them both in my handbag.

640
00:35:08,732 --> 00:35:10,316
I'll just look.

641
00:35:30,712 --> 00:35:32,588
No. I've only got one here.

642
00:35:32,756 --> 00:35:34,381
Are you sure yours isn't in your overcoat?

643
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:36,717
No, I've looked. May I borrow yours?

644
00:35:36,885 --> 00:35:39,178
- Well, that's a bit awkward.
- Why?

645
00:35:39,346 --> 00:35:40,387
I may want to go out.

646
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:43,265
- Tonight?
- I thought I might...

647
00:35:43,433 --> 00:35:44,809
go to a movie or something.

648
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:47,144
Won't you listen to the radio?
<i>Saturday Night Theatre?</i>

649
00:35:47,312 --> 00:35:50,272
Oh, no. It's a thriller.
I don't like thrillers when I'm alone.

650
00:35:50,941 --> 00:35:53,234
- I see.
- Well, in any case...

651
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:55,152
I'll be back before you.
I can let you in.

652
00:35:55,612 --> 00:35:58,697
But we won't be back until after midnight.
You may be asleep by then.

653
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:01,075
You can always put your key
under the proverbial mat.

654
00:36:01,243 --> 00:36:02,243
No, it's all right.

655
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:04,703
Here it is.
It was in my glove all the time.

656
00:36:05,205 --> 00:36:07,164
Well, that settles that.

657
00:36:07,749 --> 00:36:09,083
What movie are you going to?

658
00:36:09,251 --> 00:36:10,835
Oh, <i>The Classic,</i> I expect.

659
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:12,962
Will you get in? Saturday night?

660
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:14,797
- Oh, I can always try.
- Oh, but, darling--

661
00:36:14,965 --> 00:36:17,800
Now, don't make me stay home.
You know how I hate doing nothing.

662
00:36:17,968 --> 00:36:20,386
Doing nothing? Why, there are
hundreds of things you can do.

663
00:36:20,554 --> 00:36:22,721
Have you written to Peggy
thanking her for the weekend?

664
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:25,808
And what about those clippings?
It's an ideal opportunity.

665
00:36:25,976 --> 00:36:28,394
Well, I like that.
You two go gallivanting...

666
00:36:28,562 --> 00:36:31,647
while I stay home
and do those boring clippings.

667
00:36:32,774 --> 00:36:34,483
Very well. We won't go.

668
00:36:34,651 --> 00:36:35,693
What do you mean?

669
00:36:35,861 --> 00:36:37,653
You don't want us to go out...

670
00:36:37,821 --> 00:36:39,738
so we won't.
We'll stay here with you instead.

671
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:41,240
What shall we do, play cards?

672
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:43,868
Oh, Tony, darling.

673
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:46,620
Well, I'd better call the Grendon
and tell them we're not coming.

674
00:36:46,788 --> 00:36:50,833
Oh, Tony, please,
let's not be childish about this.

675
00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:54,628
All right, I'll do your old press clippings.

676
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:58,007
You don't have to
if you don't want to, you know.

677
00:36:58,174 --> 00:37:00,426
But I do want to.

678
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:06,932
I think I'll try and scare up a taxi.

679
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:09,560
- Have we any paste?
- There's some in the desk...

680
00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:11,103
I believe.

681
00:37:11,271 --> 00:37:14,773
- You'll need some scissors.
- Oh, they're in my mending basket.

682
00:37:38,298 --> 00:37:40,799
Lend me some change, dear.
I need some money for the taxi.

683
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:43,385
Hey, you leave my bag alone.
How much do you need anyway?

684
00:37:43,553 --> 00:37:44,970
Well, let's see how much you've got.

685
00:37:45,738 --> 00:37:47,514
- Put that down.
- You owe me 10 bob anyway.

686
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:49,683
- For what?
- I paid for that package you sent Peggy.

687
00:37:49,851 --> 00:37:51,802
- That comes out of housekeeping.
- Let me give it to you.

688
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:53,103
Keep your hands off.

689
00:37:54,648 --> 00:37:55,522
There now.

690
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:56,732
How much do you want?

691
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:58,901
Well, I've got 3, 5, 7 and sixpence.

692
00:37:59,069 --> 00:38:00,444
Enough to get us there and back.

693
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:02,988
You'd better take something.
How much are the dinner tickets?

694
00:38:03,156 --> 00:38:07,326
Already paid for, tip included.
If I run short, Mark will help out.

695
00:38:10,038 --> 00:38:10,996
Taxi's here.

696
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:18,545
What are you waiting for?

697
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:20,005
Oh, nothing, dear. Nothing.

698
00:38:20,173 --> 00:38:21,131
- Good night.
- Good night.

699
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:23,467
- What time will you get home?
- About 12, I should think.

700
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:25,844
I'll bring Mark back for a nightcap
on his way home.

701
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:28,389
I'll be fast asleep
and I don't want to be disturbed.

702
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:29,890
We shall be as quiet as mice.

703
00:38:30,058 --> 00:38:31,642
- Night.
- Night.

704
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:35,396
Uh....

705
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:37,606
Margot?

706
00:38:37,774 --> 00:38:39,191
Yes?

707
00:38:39,776 --> 00:38:41,986
It's quite possible
old man Burgess might call.

708
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:44,113
Tell him we're at the Grendon.
Might be important.

709
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,865
- What's the number? All right.
- It's in the book.

710
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:52,454
Goodbye, dear.

711
00:38:55,208 --> 00:38:56,500
All right, Mark.

712
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:11,301
I was staying at the Torbay Hotel.
Know the Torbay Hotel in Dartmoor?

713
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:14,638
Well, it's not exactly in Dartmoor,
but sort of in the district...

714
00:41:14,806 --> 00:41:17,099
if you know what I mean.
The point of this story is...

715
00:41:17,267 --> 00:41:18,892
that it concerns Dartmoor Prison.

716
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:20,269
Anyway...

717
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:23,105
I was staying at the Torbay Hotel.
I went to the bar one day....

718
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:37,619
So I turned and said,
"What are you doing here?"

719
00:41:37,787 --> 00:41:40,122
He said, "I'm a commercial traveler.
I sell...

720
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:41,540
agricultural machinery."

721
00:41:41,708 --> 00:41:42,666
I said, "Agricultural"--

722
00:41:42,834 --> 00:41:44,793
Excuse me. Any of you fellas
have the right time?

723
00:41:44,961 --> 00:41:50,299
- Yes, I have seven minutes past 11.
- I make it only just after 11.

724
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:52,801
Well, my watch has stopped.
I must have overwound it.

725
00:41:52,969 --> 00:41:54,678
So as I was saying--

726
00:41:54,846 --> 00:41:56,597
Excuse me, old boy.
I have to call my boss.

727
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:58,140
Agricultural machinery....

728
00:43:14,467 --> 00:43:16,009
Hello.

729
00:43:18,054 --> 00:43:19,388
Hello?

730
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:23,809
Hello?

731
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:30,899
Hello?

732
00:43:33,653 --> 00:43:35,153
Hello?

733
00:43:36,781 --> 00:43:38,156
<i>Hello?</i>

734
00:43:41,494 --> 00:43:42,744
Hello?

735
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:46,683
<i>Get the police. Quickly. Police.</i>

736
00:44:48,895 --> 00:44:51,563
- Margot?
- <i>Who's there?</i>

737
00:44:51,731 --> 00:44:53,065
Darling, it's me.

738
00:44:54,316 --> 00:44:55,776
Oh, Tony. 

739
00:44:55,943 --> 00:45:00,113
Tony, thank God. Come back at once.

740
00:45:00,490 --> 00:45:01,531
What's the matter?

741
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:05,827
<i>I can't explain now.
Come quickly, please.</i>

742
00:45:05,995 --> 00:45:08,747
Now, darling, pull yourself together.
What is it?

743
00:45:08,915 --> 00:45:13,168
<i>A man attacked me.
He tried to strangle me.</i>

744
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:15,754
Did he get away?

745
00:45:16,255 --> 00:45:19,383
<i>No. He's dead. He's dead.</i>

746
00:45:26,391 --> 00:45:27,891
Tony, are you still there?

747
00:45:28,684 --> 00:45:30,727
- Margot.
- <i>Yes?</i>

748
00:45:30,895 --> 00:45:32,896
Now, listen very carefully.

749
00:45:33,064 --> 00:45:34,439
<i>Yes, I'm listening.</i>

750
00:45:34,607 --> 00:45:36,775
Don't touch anything.
I'll be with you right away.

751
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:38,985
No. No, I won't.

752
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:43,407
<i>Don't touch anything
and don't speak to anybody until I get there.</i>

753
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:46,827
- No, I won't touch anything.
- <i>You promise?</i>

754
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:50,705
Yes, I promise.
Only, please, be quick.

755
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:46,094
I'm sitting at the same bar...

756
00:46:46,262 --> 00:46:48,180
and I see the same man
standing at the end...

757
00:46:48,347 --> 00:46:50,015
and he came across to me and said--

758
00:46:50,183 --> 00:46:51,850
No, do sit down. I have to run along.

759
00:46:52,018 --> 00:46:53,602
It's Margot. She's not feeling well.

760
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:54,895
- Serious?
- Nothing serious.

761
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:56,271
- You stay and enjoy.
- I'll come.

762
00:46:56,439 --> 00:46:58,231
No, it's perfectly all right.

763
00:46:58,774 --> 00:47:02,652
--with which he was buying me
dry martinis. Anyway....

764
00:47:31,641 --> 00:47:34,059
Tony! Oh, Tony. 

765
00:47:34,227 --> 00:47:37,562
It's all right, darling. It's all right.
What happened?

766
00:47:37,730 --> 00:47:41,483
He put something around my throat.
It felt like a stocking.

767
00:47:41,651 --> 00:47:44,110
Are you sure? Let me see.

768
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:46,696
I got up to answer the phone...

769
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:49,824
and he came from behind the curtain
and tried to strangle me.

770
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:51,368
I almost...

771
00:47:51,536 --> 00:47:52,786
passed out.

772
00:47:52,954 --> 00:47:54,788
I felt the scissors in my hands.

773
00:47:54,956 --> 00:47:56,206
Then he let go suddenly...

774
00:47:56,374 --> 00:47:59,501
and he fell on the floor.

775
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:30,949
There's hardly any blood.

776
00:48:31,576 --> 00:48:34,119
When he fell, he must have--
What are you doing?

777
00:48:34,287 --> 00:48:35,745
I'm trying to find my....

778
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:39,791
Oh, here they are. My aspirin.
I've got such an awful head.

779
00:48:56,225 --> 00:48:57,309
What is it?

780
00:48:57,476 --> 00:48:59,436
I'd better get a blanket.

781
00:49:14,994 --> 00:49:16,369
Shut the window, please.

782
00:49:17,288 --> 00:49:19,789
No, we mustn't touch anything
till the police arrive.

783
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:23,293
He must've broken in.
I wonder what he was after.

784
00:49:23,461 --> 00:49:24,669
Those cups, I expect.

785
00:49:25,087 --> 00:49:26,421
When will the police get here?

786
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:28,548
Have you called them already?

787
00:49:28,716 --> 00:49:31,593
No. You told me not to speak to anyone.

788
00:49:33,638 --> 00:49:35,347
Hadn't you better call them now?

789
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:36,931
Yes.

790
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:41,561
- Where's Mark?
- I told him to go straight home.

791
00:49:41,729 --> 00:49:42,604
<i>Operator.</i>

792
00:49:42,772 --> 00:49:45,190
Hello, operator.
Get me the Maida Vale Police, quickly.

793
00:49:45,358 --> 00:49:46,066
Did you tell him?

794
00:49:46,442 --> 00:49:49,361
No, I didn't know what had happened.
I just said you weren't feeling well.

795
00:49:49,528 --> 00:49:50,904
<i>Maida Vale Police.</i>

796
00:49:51,072 --> 00:49:53,657
Oh, police, there's been a ghastly accident.

797
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:55,867
- <i>Yes, sir?</i>
- A man has been killed.

798
00:49:56,494 --> 00:49:57,911
- <i>Your name, sir?</i>
- Wendice.

799
00:49:58,663 --> 00:50:00,789
- <i>Is that a double "S"?</i>
- No, D-I-C-E.

800
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:02,791
C-E. Your address, sir?

801
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:06,461
<i>61-A Charrington Gardens,
the ground floor apartment.</i>

802
00:50:06,629 --> 00:50:07,462
Was it an accident?

803
00:50:08,464 --> 00:50:09,547
I don't know.

804
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:11,675
What do you mean, sir, you don't know?

805
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:13,968
You think he might have been killed by someone?

806
00:50:14,136 --> 00:50:17,013
<i>Well, I don't know.</i>

807
00:50:17,181 --> 00:50:19,641
<i>Well, have you any idea
who might have done it?</i>

808
00:50:24,105 --> 00:50:26,314
I'll explain that when you come.
How long will it take?

809
00:50:26,482 --> 00:50:28,108
- <i>About two minutes.</i>
- Two minutes?

810
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:30,318
And don't touch anything, will you, sir?

811
00:50:30,486 --> 00:50:32,487
No, we won't touch anything. Goodbye.

812
00:50:33,364 --> 00:50:34,447
I'll get dressed.

813
00:50:34,615 --> 00:50:36,032
Why?

814
00:50:36,659 --> 00:50:37,784
They'll want to see me.

815
00:50:37,952 --> 00:50:41,287
- They're not going to see you.
- But they'll have to ask me questions.

816
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:44,582
They can wait till tomorrow.
I'll tell them all they need to know.

817
00:50:45,584 --> 00:50:47,043
- Tony.
- Yes?

818
00:50:47,211 --> 00:50:48,253
Why did you phone me?

819
00:50:49,171 --> 00:50:49,921
What?

820
00:50:50,256 --> 00:50:52,924
I'm sorry, darling,
I'll tell you about that later.

821
00:50:53,092 --> 00:50:56,302
I just thought of something.
You said he used a stocking?

822
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:59,431
I think it was a stocking or a scarf.
Isn't it there?

823
00:50:59,598 --> 00:51:03,601
No, but I expect they'll find it.
Now, you go on to bed.

824
00:53:40,301 --> 00:53:41,968
Tea, gentlemen?

825
00:54:00,779 --> 00:54:02,030
- Sergeant.
- Mm-hm?

826
00:54:02,197 --> 00:54:04,532
Look, it's the other stocking.

827
00:54:22,009 --> 00:54:24,844
All right, break it up.
Let's get moving on.

828
00:54:48,786 --> 00:54:51,871
Hm. Almost empty.
Remind me to get some more.

829
00:54:52,039 --> 00:54:53,748
It always runs out just when we need it.

830
00:54:53,916 --> 00:54:56,501
Oh, look, before I forget,
the sergeant wanted to know...

831
00:54:56,669 --> 00:54:58,503
why you didn't phone the police immediately.

832
00:54:58,671 --> 00:55:01,089
- How could I? You were on the phone.
- I know, but--

833
00:55:01,256 --> 00:55:03,883
You distinctly told me
not to speak to anyone until you got here.

834
00:55:04,051 --> 00:55:07,303
I know, darling, but I told him
a slightly different story.

835
00:55:07,471 --> 00:55:08,262
Why?

836
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:11,015
Well, I said you didn't phone the police
because you assumed...

837
00:55:11,183 --> 00:55:13,059
that I would do it from the hotel.

838
00:55:13,227 --> 00:55:14,560
Why did you say that?

839
00:55:14,728 --> 00:55:17,981
Because it was the perfectly logical explanation,
and he accepted it.

840
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:21,484
Now, if they get the idea
that we delayed reporting it...

841
00:55:21,652 --> 00:55:24,237
they might get nosy
and start asking all sorts of questions--

842
00:55:24,405 --> 00:55:26,044
So you want me to say the same thing?

843
00:55:26,045 --> 00:55:28,157
I think so, dear, in case it comes up again.

844
00:55:29,410 --> 00:55:31,619
Oh, that'll be Mark.
Would you let him in?

845
00:55:35,708 --> 00:55:36,833
Good morning, madam.

846
00:55:37,001 --> 00:55:38,334
Oh. Good morning.

847
00:55:38,502 --> 00:55:40,086
- Mrs. Wendice?
- Yes.

848
00:55:40,254 --> 00:55:43,881
- I'm a police officer. May I come in?
- Of course.

849
00:55:49,430 --> 00:55:51,556
Excuse me.
I'll just tell my husband you're here.

850
00:55:51,724 --> 00:55:53,182
Oh, thank you.

851
00:56:17,041 --> 00:56:17,957
Good morning.

852
00:56:18,125 --> 00:56:20,168
Good morning, sir.
I'm Chief Inspector Hubbard...

853
00:56:20,335 --> 00:56:22,670
in charge of criminal investigation
of this division.

854
00:56:22,838 --> 00:56:25,173
We gave your sergeant
all the necessary information.

855
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:27,050
Yes. I've seen his report, of course...

856
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:31,012
but there are a few things
I'd like to get firsthand.

857
00:56:31,346 --> 00:56:35,016
I gather the sergeant only saw you
for a few moments, Mrs. Wendice?

858
00:56:35,184 --> 00:56:36,225
Yes, I--

859
00:56:36,393 --> 00:56:38,394
My wife was suffering from considerable shock.

860
00:56:38,562 --> 00:56:41,189
Yes, that was a very nasty experience you had.

861
00:56:41,356 --> 00:56:42,899
Do you mind if I take a look around?

862
00:56:43,067 --> 00:56:45,693
Go ahead. The bedroom and bathroom
are through here.

863
00:56:58,665 --> 00:57:01,042
He certainly didn't get in by the bathroom.

864
00:57:06,006 --> 00:57:08,549
And the kitchen has bars on the window.

865
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:16,557
We assume he must have come in
through these windows here.

866
00:57:16,725 --> 00:57:19,268
I, uh-- I understand you weren't here
when this happened.

867
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:21,938
No, I was at a dinner party
at the Grendon Hotel.

868
00:57:22,106 --> 00:57:23,356
And by a curious coincidence...

869
00:57:23,524 --> 00:57:25,691
I was actually phoning my wife
when she was attacked.

870
00:57:25,859 --> 00:57:28,903
So I gather. Can you tell me
exactly what time it was, sir?

871
00:57:29,071 --> 00:57:33,074
No, I'm afraid I can't.
I do remember my watch had stopped.

872
00:57:35,911 --> 00:57:38,246
Did you notice, Mrs. Wendice?

873
00:57:39,164 --> 00:57:40,039
No, I didn't.

874
00:57:40,207 --> 00:57:41,582
Won't you sit down, inspector?

875
00:57:42,084 --> 00:57:43,584
Thank you.

876
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:48,506
Have you any idea who he was?

877
00:57:49,424 --> 00:57:53,386
Hmm? Oh, yes. At least,
we've discovered where he lived.

878
00:57:53,554 --> 00:57:56,681
There still seems to be some confusion
as to his real name.

879
00:57:56,849 --> 00:57:58,683
- Oh?
- He appeared to have several.

880
00:58:00,185 --> 00:58:03,604
- Had you ever seen him before?
- Why, no, of course not.

881
00:58:05,816 --> 00:58:06,858
Oh.

882
00:58:07,025 --> 00:58:08,901
- Is this him?
- Yes.

883
00:58:09,069 --> 00:58:12,488
- You don't recognize him?
- No, I never saw him.

884
00:58:12,781 --> 00:58:15,199
But didn't you even catch
a glimpse of his face?

885
00:58:15,367 --> 00:58:17,368
No. You see, he attacked me from behind...

886
00:58:17,536 --> 00:58:20,454
and it was dark.
I hardly saw him at all.

887
00:58:20,622 --> 00:58:24,250
But before I showed you these photographs,
you said you'd never seen him...

888
00:58:24,418 --> 00:58:25,168
before.

889
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:28,629
How could you know that
if you never saw his face last night?

890
00:58:28,797 --> 00:58:30,089
I don't quite understand.

891
00:58:30,257 --> 00:58:32,842
Inspector, my wife simply means
that as far as she knew...

892
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:34,886
she never saw him before.

893
00:58:35,053 --> 00:58:36,762
- Was that what you meant?
- Yes.

894
00:58:36,930 --> 00:58:39,640
Yeah. Now, how about you, sir?
Had you ever seen him before?

895
00:58:40,934 --> 00:58:41,767
No.

896
00:58:44,855 --> 00:58:45,521
No.

897
00:58:46,064 --> 00:58:47,565
- At least....
- Yes?

898
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:50,193
It's very like someone
I was at college with.

899
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,153
But the mustache makes quite a difference.

900
00:58:52,404 --> 00:58:53,738
Oh? What was his name?

901
00:58:53,906 --> 00:58:56,699
Oh, I don't know.
It must be 20 years since I left.

902
00:58:56,867 --> 00:58:59,994
- Was it, uh, Lesgate?
- No.

903
00:59:00,162 --> 00:59:01,954
- Wilson?
- No.

904
00:59:02,122 --> 00:59:02,788
Swann?

905
00:59:02,956 --> 00:59:05,291
N-- Swann?

906
00:59:06,418 --> 00:59:09,420
Wait a minute. Swann.
Yes, that's it.

907
00:59:14,468 --> 00:59:17,470
Here's an old photo taken at a reunion.
We were at the same college together.

908
00:59:17,638 --> 00:59:18,804
There he is there.

909
00:59:18,972 --> 00:59:21,724
- Why, it's unbelievable.
- Did you know him well?

910
00:59:21,892 --> 00:59:23,267
No. He was senior to me.

911
00:59:23,435 --> 00:59:25,394
- Have you met him since then?
- No.

912
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:27,104
At least....

913
00:59:27,272 --> 00:59:30,358
Come to think of it, I did see him
quite recently, but not to speak to.

914
00:59:30,525 --> 00:59:33,611
- Oh? When was that?
- Six months ago at a railway station.

915
00:59:33,779 --> 00:59:34,946
Victoria, I think.

916
00:59:35,364 --> 00:59:37,490
I remember noticing how little he'd changed.

917
00:59:37,658 --> 00:59:40,534
- Had he a mustache then, sir?
- No.

918
00:59:40,869 --> 00:59:44,914
Hm. Uh, Mrs. Wendice, would you show me
exactly what happened last night?

919
00:59:45,707 --> 00:59:48,834
- Tony, do I have to?
- I'm afraid so, darling.

920
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:58,636
I was in bed when the phone rang,
and I got up and I came in here.

921
00:59:58,804 --> 01:00:00,888
- Did you switch this light on?
- No.

922
01:00:01,056 --> 01:00:03,599
Just show me exactly
where you were standing.

923
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:11,983
I stood here and I picked up the phone.

924
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:13,109
Just one moment.

925
01:00:13,277 --> 01:00:15,611
Are you sure you had your back
to the window like that?

926
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:17,321
Yes.

927
01:00:17,489 --> 01:00:19,699
- But why?
- Why not?

928
01:00:20,350 --> 01:00:24,912
I mean, why go around the desk?
I should have picked it up from this side.

929
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:26,998
But I always answer the phone from here.

930
01:00:27,165 --> 01:00:28,416
But why?

931
01:00:28,583 --> 01:00:32,545
In case I have to write anything down.
I can hold the phone in my left hand.

932
01:00:34,715 --> 01:00:37,300
I see. I'm sorry. Go on.

933
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:38,884
When I picked up the phone...

934
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:42,388
he must have come from behind those curtains
and attacked me.

935
01:00:42,556 --> 01:00:45,391
- He got something around my neck.
- What do you mean by "something"?

936
01:00:46,184 --> 01:00:47,601
I think it was a stocking.

937
01:00:47,769 --> 01:00:50,146
I see. And what happened then?

938
01:00:50,314 --> 01:00:53,190
Well, then he pushed me across the desk.

939
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:55,192
I distinctly remember feeling for the scissors.

940
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:57,361
Where were those scissors usually kept?

941
01:00:57,529 --> 01:01:00,823
In that mending basket.
I'd forgotten to put them away.

942
01:01:01,074 --> 01:01:04,243
Now, what makes you think
he came from behind those curtains?

943
01:01:04,411 --> 01:01:05,870
Where else could he have been?

944
01:01:06,038 --> 01:01:07,204
- The curtains were drawn?
- Yes.

945
01:01:07,372 --> 01:01:08,622
Did you draw them yourself?

946
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:10,958
No, inspector, I drew them
just before I went out.

947
01:01:11,126 --> 01:01:13,461
- Did you lock the window at the same time?
- Yes.

948
01:01:13,628 --> 01:01:15,046
Are you quite sure of that, sir?

949
01:01:15,213 --> 01:01:17,882
Oh, perfectly sure. I always lock up
when I draw the curtains.

950
01:01:18,050 --> 01:01:20,801
- Then how do you suppose he got in?
- We assume that he broke in.

951
01:01:20,969 --> 01:01:22,511
Well, there's no sign of a break-in.

952
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:25,514
Our report shows the lock's quite undamaged.

953
01:01:25,932 --> 01:01:26,640
Mrs. Wendice...

954
01:01:27,851 --> 01:01:29,185
why didn't you call the police...

955
01:01:29,353 --> 01:01:31,062
immediately this happened?

956
01:01:35,067 --> 01:01:36,859
I was trying to get through to the police...

957
01:01:37,027 --> 01:01:39,236
when I discovered my husband
was on the line.

958
01:01:39,571 --> 01:01:42,073
I naturally thought he would call the police
from the hotel...

959
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:44,033
before he came here.

960
01:01:44,201 --> 01:01:47,328
Uh, didn't it occur to you
to call a doctor?

961
01:01:47,496 --> 01:01:49,413
- No.
- Why ever not?

962
01:01:49,956 --> 01:01:52,833
- He was dead.
- How did you know that?

963
01:01:53,001 --> 01:01:55,127
I.... It was obvious.

964
01:01:55,295 --> 01:01:58,172
- Did you feel his pulse?
- No, of course I didn't.

965
01:01:58,340 --> 01:02:02,009
Anyone would have realized he was dead.
Just one look at those staring eyes--

966
01:02:02,177 --> 01:02:04,136
Oh, so you did see his face, after all.

967
01:02:04,304 --> 01:02:07,515
I saw his eyes!
I can't remember his face!

968
01:02:07,766 --> 01:02:10,601
Inspector, my wife obviously
had never seen this man before.

969
01:02:10,769 --> 01:02:12,978
If he didn't come in by those windows,
how did he get in?

970
01:02:15,649 --> 01:02:19,318
As a matter of fact, we're quite certain
that he came in by this door.

971
01:02:20,153 --> 01:02:21,862
But it was locked.

972
01:02:22,030 --> 01:02:24,949
Margot, did you open that door
at all after we'd gone?

973
01:02:25,117 --> 01:02:25,866
No.

974
01:02:26,034 --> 01:02:28,869
- How many keys are there to this door?
- Only two.

975
01:02:29,037 --> 01:02:31,664
Mine was in my handbag,
and you had yours with you.

976
01:02:31,832 --> 01:02:33,582
Yes, that's right.

977
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:35,793
- Has the caretaker got a key?
- No.

978
01:02:35,961 --> 01:02:37,294
Do you employ a charwoman?

979
01:02:37,462 --> 01:02:40,631
Yes, but she hasn't got one either.
I'm always here when she comes.

980
01:02:40,799 --> 01:02:42,508
What makes you think he came in this way?

981
01:02:44,511 --> 01:02:45,302
His shoes.

982
01:02:45,470 --> 01:02:46,512
His shoes?

983
01:02:47,973 --> 01:02:49,974
The ground was soaking wet last night.

984
01:02:50,142 --> 01:02:53,686
And if he'd come in by the garden,
he'd have left mud all over the carpet.

985
01:02:53,854 --> 01:02:55,813
As it is, he didn't leave
any marks at all...

986
01:02:55,981 --> 01:02:58,315
because he wiped his shoes
on the front doormat.

987
01:02:58,567 --> 01:02:59,358
How can you tell?

988
01:02:59,526 --> 01:03:02,945
It's a fairly new mat
and some of its fibers came off on his shoes.

989
01:03:03,113 --> 01:03:03,779
Oh, but surely--

990
01:03:03,947 --> 01:03:08,159
And there was a small tar stain on the mat,
and some of the fibers show that as well.

991
01:03:08,326 --> 01:03:09,785
No, there's no question about it.

992
01:03:11,746 --> 01:03:14,999
Wait a minute. I think I've got it.

993
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:17,418
You remember when your bag was stolen?

994
01:03:17,586 --> 01:03:18,252
Yes.

995
01:03:18,795 --> 01:03:20,713
Wasn't the key inside?

996
01:03:20,881 --> 01:03:23,090
Yes, but it was still there
when I got it back.

997
01:03:23,258 --> 01:03:25,926
Now, just a moment.
I'd like to hear about this.

998
01:03:26,094 --> 01:03:27,219
What sort of bag?

999
01:03:27,387 --> 01:03:29,763
A handbag, inspector.
My wife lost it at Victoria Station.

1000
01:03:29,931 --> 01:03:32,975
But I got it back from the lost
and found about two weeks later.

1001
01:03:33,143 --> 01:03:33,976
Was anything missing?

1002
01:03:34,686 --> 01:03:35,936
All the money was gone.

1003
01:03:36,104 --> 01:03:37,480
- Anything else?
- No.

1004
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:40,858
- I mean, no papers or letters?
- No.

1005
01:03:41,443 --> 01:03:42,943
Are you quite sure about that?

1006
01:03:43,111 --> 01:03:44,069
Yes.

1007
01:03:44,237 --> 01:03:46,739
Your latchkey was in your handbag
when you lost it?

1008
01:03:46,907 --> 01:03:49,158
Yes, but it was still there
when it was returned.

1009
01:03:49,326 --> 01:03:51,494
Whoever stole the money
could have copied the key.

1010
01:03:51,912 --> 01:03:53,829
Where was the bag found eventually?

1011
01:03:53,997 --> 01:03:55,956
At Victoria Station.

1012
01:03:56,124 --> 01:03:58,375
Wasn't that where you said
you saw this man, sir?

1013
01:03:59,294 --> 01:04:00,753
When did you lose the bag?

1014
01:04:00,921 --> 01:04:03,130
Wasn't it that weekend
we went to visit Peggy?

1015
01:04:03,298 --> 01:04:06,300
Yes, it was. I remember now.
He was sitting in the restaurant.

1016
01:04:06,468 --> 01:04:07,843
That where you left your bag?

1017
01:04:08,011 --> 01:04:11,472
Yes, and didn't I say something about
"There's someone I was at college with"?

1018
01:04:12,182 --> 01:04:13,766
I don't remember.

1019
01:04:13,934 --> 01:04:15,851
That's how he got in.
He had a duplicate made...

1020
01:04:16,019 --> 01:04:19,104
- and returned the original to the bag.
- Before you go any further...

1021
01:04:19,397 --> 01:04:21,649
how did he get in
through the street door?

1022
01:04:21,816 --> 01:04:23,526
Well, the street door is never locked.

1023
01:04:23,693 --> 01:04:25,236
I see.

1024
01:04:25,403 --> 01:04:28,155
He could have had your key copied...

1025
01:04:28,323 --> 01:04:31,492
and he could have used it
to open the door...

1026
01:04:32,702 --> 01:04:34,828
but of course he didn't.

1027
01:04:35,455 --> 01:04:36,121
Why not?

1028
01:04:36,289 --> 01:04:37,122
Because if he had...

1029
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:39,500
the key would still have been on him
when he died.

1030
01:04:39,668 --> 01:04:41,502
No key was found when we went
through his pockets.

1031
01:04:46,049 --> 01:04:48,133
We seem to be back just where we started,
don't we?

1032
01:04:49,344 --> 01:04:50,469
Well, not quite.

1033
01:04:51,346 --> 01:04:52,513
Well, then how did he get in?

1034
01:04:53,139 --> 01:04:55,558
We'd better get all this down on paper.

1035
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:57,977
I'd like you both to make
an official statement...

1036
01:04:58,144 --> 01:04:59,520
before the inquest.

1037
01:04:59,688 --> 01:05:02,439
My office is only a few moments from here.
Perhaps you could come now.

1038
01:05:07,028 --> 01:05:09,363
- Tony.
- Mark. Oh, this is Inspector Hubbard.

1039
01:05:09,531 --> 01:05:12,074
Inspector, this is Mark Halliday.
He was with me last night.

1040
01:05:12,242 --> 01:05:13,325
How do you do, inspector?

1041
01:05:13,493 --> 01:05:17,121
As you were with Mr. Wendice last night,
you may be able to help us here.

1042
01:05:17,289 --> 01:05:20,874
Now, did you notice what time it was
he went to the phone?

1043
01:05:21,042 --> 01:05:23,544
Yes, matter of fact,
it was just three minutes after 11.

1044
01:05:23,712 --> 01:05:25,629
How did you come to notice that?

1045
01:05:25,797 --> 01:05:28,674
Well, Mr. Wendice's watch had stopped
and some of us compared times.

1046
01:05:28,842 --> 01:05:31,802
Thank you. So you see,
it was when Mrs. Wendice came in here...

1047
01:05:31,970 --> 01:05:34,847
to answer his call that she was attacked.

1048
01:05:35,056 --> 01:05:37,766
Did you phone Margot
before or after you phoned your boss?

1049
01:05:37,934 --> 01:05:39,602
Tony, I know what I wanted to ask you.

1050
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:40,436
Why did you...

1051
01:05:40,604 --> 01:05:41,645
telephone me last night?

1052
01:05:41,813 --> 01:05:45,190
Now, just one moment,
before I lose the thread of this.

1053
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:49,153
Now, at three minutes past 11,
you left your party to phone your boss.

1054
01:05:49,321 --> 01:05:50,904
Yes, I used the pay phone in the lobby.

1055
01:05:51,072 --> 01:05:54,533
How long were you on the telephone to your boss
before you called your wife?

1056
01:05:54,701 --> 01:05:57,953
In fact, I never did speak to him.
I couldn't remember his number...

1057
01:05:58,121 --> 01:06:01,123
so I rang my wife to ask her
to look it up in the address book.

1058
01:06:01,291 --> 01:06:03,709
You mean you hauled me out of bed
just to get his number?

1059
01:06:03,877 --> 01:06:04,877
I had to, darling.

1060
01:06:05,045 --> 01:06:06,795
My boss is flying to Brussels this morning.

1061
01:06:06,963 --> 01:06:09,673
I wanted to remind him of something.
It was rather important.

1062
01:06:09,841 --> 01:06:11,967
Wasn't there a telephone directory in the hotel?

1063
01:06:12,135 --> 01:06:14,386
Yes, but his country number
wouldn't be in that directory.

1064
01:06:14,554 --> 01:06:16,722
Mm. And did you phone him?

1065
01:06:16,890 --> 01:06:20,184
Oh, no. Naturally when I heard what
had happened here, I forgot all about it.

1066
01:06:20,352 --> 01:06:23,187
Mm. Yes.

1067
01:06:23,355 --> 01:06:25,981
Mr. Halliday, Mr. and Mrs. Wendice
are coming to my office...

1068
01:06:26,149 --> 01:06:27,566
to make their statements.

1069
01:06:27,734 --> 01:06:30,694
Would you give me your address, sir?
I may want to get in touch with you.

1070
01:06:30,862 --> 01:06:32,655
- Why, certainly.
- I'll get my coat.

1071
01:06:32,822 --> 01:06:34,281
I'm staying at Carfax Hotel.

1072
01:06:34,449 --> 01:06:37,159
Just write it down there, will you?
Your telephone number as well.

1073
01:06:37,327 --> 01:06:38,786
All right.

1074
01:06:47,212 --> 01:06:48,962
Ever been over here before, sir?

1075
01:06:49,130 --> 01:06:52,675
- Uh, yes. Yes, about a year ago.
- Mm.

1076
01:06:52,842 --> 01:06:55,219
- There you are, sir.
- Thank you.

1077
01:06:56,137 --> 01:06:57,012
Uh, Mr. Wendice.

1078
01:06:57,180 --> 01:06:58,931
There's quite a crowd
in front of the house.

1079
01:06:59,099 --> 01:07:01,266
I was going to suggest
that we left by the garden.

1080
01:07:01,434 --> 01:07:03,227
- Isn't there's a gate at the far end?
- Yes.

1081
01:07:03,395 --> 01:07:06,271
I'm afraid the gate may be locked.
Would you mind taking a look, sir?

1082
01:07:06,439 --> 01:07:07,981
Certainly.

1083
01:07:14,656 --> 01:07:16,949
How much does he know
about you and Mrs. Wendice?

1084
01:07:18,785 --> 01:07:19,868
I beg your pardon?

1085
01:07:20,161 --> 01:07:22,413
You wrote a letter to Mrs. Wendice
from New York.

1086
01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:25,499
It was found in the dead man's
inside pocket.

1087
01:07:25,667 --> 01:07:29,420
I didn't mention it because
I wasn't sure how much Mr. Wendice knew.

1088
01:07:29,587 --> 01:07:31,547
Have you any idea how it got there?

1089
01:07:31,715 --> 01:07:32,923
No.

1090
01:07:35,218 --> 01:07:37,636
- Where's Tony?
- He's just gone into the garden.

1091
01:07:37,804 --> 01:07:40,264
Mrs. Wendice, when you lost your handbag...

1092
01:07:40,432 --> 01:07:42,224
did you lose a letter as well?

1093
01:07:43,351 --> 01:07:44,017
No.

1094
01:07:44,185 --> 01:07:47,312
Margot, it was found
in the dead man's pocket.

1095
01:07:47,522 --> 01:07:49,815
You did lose it, didn't you?

1096
01:07:51,276 --> 01:07:52,609
Yes, I did.

1097
01:07:52,777 --> 01:07:54,528
I asked you that before, didn't I?

1098
01:07:54,696 --> 01:07:58,240
Yes, but you see,
my husband didn't know about it.

1099
01:07:58,408 --> 01:08:00,451
This man was blackmailing you,
wasn't he?

1100
01:08:00,618 --> 01:08:01,368
It's no good.

1101
01:08:01,536 --> 01:08:02,661
- Tony will have to know.
- No.

1102
01:08:02,829 --> 01:08:04,329
It's the only thing we can do. Inspector...

1103
01:08:04,497 --> 01:08:08,709
after Mrs. Wendice lost my letter,
she received these two notes.

1104
01:08:13,631 --> 01:08:15,674
Last October.

1105
01:08:16,342 --> 01:08:17,801
How many times have you seen this man?

1106
01:08:17,969 --> 01:08:20,345
I've never seen him.

1107
01:08:20,513 --> 01:08:22,848
- I'd like you to come along with us.
- Yes, of course.

1108
01:08:23,016 --> 01:08:26,393
Mrs. Wendice, when you come
to make your statement...

1109
01:08:26,561 --> 01:08:28,896
there may be other police officers present.

1110
01:08:29,063 --> 01:08:31,356
I shall warn you first
that anything you say...

1111
01:08:31,524 --> 01:08:33,901
will be taken down
and may be used in evidence.

1112
01:08:34,444 --> 01:08:36,278
Now, never mind
what you've told me so far.

1113
01:08:36,446 --> 01:08:38,655
We'll forget all about that.

1114
01:08:38,823 --> 01:08:42,201
But from now on, tell us exactly
what you know about this man...

1115
01:08:42,368 --> 01:08:44,286
and exactly what happened last night.

1116
01:08:44,954 --> 01:08:45,954
If you try and conceal...

1117
01:08:46,122 --> 01:08:47,080
anything at all...

1118
01:08:47,248 --> 01:08:49,625
it may put you
in a very serious position.

1119
01:08:49,793 --> 01:08:52,002
I wish you'd explain
what you mean by all this.

1120
01:08:52,504 --> 01:08:56,340
I will. Now, you admit
that you killed this man.

1121
01:08:56,508 --> 01:08:58,467
Well, you say you did it in self-defense.

1122
01:08:59,177 --> 01:09:01,011
Unfortunately, there were no witnesses...

1123
01:09:01,179 --> 01:09:03,305
so we've only your word for that.

1124
01:09:03,473 --> 01:09:06,975
But I heard it all, inspector,
over the telephone.

1125
01:09:07,143 --> 01:09:09,102
What exactly did you hear, Mr. Wendice?

1126
01:09:09,270 --> 01:09:11,939
Well, I heard a series of faint cries.

1127
01:09:12,148 --> 01:09:15,359
Well, did you hear anything to indicate
that a struggle was going on?

1128
01:09:15,527 --> 01:09:19,321
What I did hear, inspector,
is perfectly consistent with what my wife told me.

1129
01:09:19,489 --> 01:09:23,826
So all you really know of the matter
is what your wife told you, isn't it?

1130
01:09:24,452 --> 01:09:27,496
Now, you suggest that this man
came to burgle your flat...

1131
01:09:27,705 --> 01:09:29,081
but there's no evidence of that.

1132
01:09:29,624 --> 01:09:31,959
There is evidence, however,
that he was blackmailing you.

1133
01:09:33,378 --> 01:09:34,127
Blackmail?

1134
01:09:34,295 --> 01:09:35,629
Yes, I'm afraid that's true.

1135
01:09:35,797 --> 01:09:37,798
And you suggest he came in
by the window.

1136
01:09:37,966 --> 01:09:40,342
And we know that he came in
by that door.

1137
01:09:40,510 --> 01:09:43,220
But he can't have come in that way.
That door was locked.

1138
01:09:43,388 --> 01:09:44,847
And there are only two keys.

1139
01:09:45,014 --> 01:09:47,558
My husband had his with him
and mine was in my handbag. Here.

1140
01:09:49,644 --> 01:09:50,894
You could have let him in.

1141
01:09:51,312 --> 01:09:53,230
Are you suggesting
she let him in herself?

1142
01:09:53,398 --> 01:09:56,191
That appears to be the only way
he could've entered.

1143
01:09:56,359 --> 01:09:58,986
Don't you even believe I was attacked?

1144
01:09:59,153 --> 01:10:01,321
How do you think
I got these bruises on my throat?

1145
01:10:01,990 --> 01:10:04,616
You could have caused those bruises yourself.

1146
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:08,912
A silk stocking was found
outside the window.

1147
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:11,498
It had two knots tied in it.

1148
01:10:12,292 --> 01:10:13,709
Does that mean anything to you?

1149
01:10:14,002 --> 01:10:16,336
I suppose it must have been
the stocking he used.

1150
01:10:16,504 --> 01:10:20,632
We found the twin stocking
hidden underneath this blotting pad.

1151
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:23,427
Can you explain why your attacker
should do that?

1152
01:10:24,262 --> 01:10:25,470
No.

1153
01:10:25,638 --> 01:10:27,306
Those stockings were yours,
weren't they?

1154
01:10:27,473 --> 01:10:28,640
No.

1155
01:10:28,808 --> 01:10:29,933
We know they were.

1156
01:10:30,351 --> 01:10:34,521
One of the heels had been darned
with some silk that didn't quite match.

1157
01:10:34,689 --> 01:10:37,149
We found a reel of that silk
in your mending basket.

1158
01:10:40,361 --> 01:10:43,238
Tony, there was a pair of stockings here.

1159
01:10:47,368 --> 01:10:51,330
I've heard of the police deliberately planting clues
to ensure a conviction.

1160
01:10:52,081 --> 01:10:54,041
His men were here for hours last night.

1161
01:10:54,208 --> 01:10:56,793
They could've taken those stockings
and done anything with them.

1162
01:10:56,961 --> 01:10:57,711
Of course they did.

1163
01:10:57,879 --> 01:10:59,713
Probably wiped his shoes
on the doormat as well.

1164
01:10:59,881 --> 01:11:00,881
<i>Hello?</i>

1165
01:11:01,049 --> 01:11:04,092
Oh, hello, Roger, thank heaven you're in.
Tony Wendice here.

1166
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:07,137
Uh, listen, we had a burglary last night
and Margot was attacked.

1167
01:11:07,305 --> 01:11:08,722
<i>Margot? Was she hurt?</i>

1168
01:11:08,890 --> 01:11:11,600
No, she's all right, but the man was killed,
and the police are here.

1169
01:11:11,768 --> 01:11:12,643
And don't laugh...

1170
01:11:12,810 --> 01:11:15,145
they're suggesting that Margot
killed him intentionally.

1171
01:11:15,313 --> 01:11:17,064
I wouldn't say that
if I were you, sir.

1172
01:11:17,231 --> 01:11:18,490
<i>Well, that's a good one.</i> 

1173
01:11:18,858 --> 01:11:20,150
Yes, it is funny, isn't it?

1174
01:11:20,318 --> 01:11:23,278
Now, Roger, could you come around at once,
Maida Vale Police Station?

1175
01:11:23,446 --> 01:11:26,073
- <i>I'll be there right away.</i>
- Oh, thanks, old boy. Goodbye.

1176
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:28,951
It's all right, darling.
Roger's gonna meet us at the police station.

1177
01:11:29,118 --> 01:11:30,786
Mr. Wendice, I should advise you--

1178
01:11:30,954 --> 01:11:33,789
Our lawyer will give us any advice we need,
thank you.

1179
01:11:36,459 --> 01:11:38,043
Margot.

1180
01:11:38,586 --> 01:11:40,921
- Here's your handbag.
- Thank you.

1181
01:11:42,090 --> 01:11:44,883
- You are coming?
- Oh, but of course, inspector.

1182
01:11:45,051 --> 01:11:48,720
Yes. Yes, well, I just--
I mean, I just wondered.

1183
01:12:06,531 --> 01:12:09,324
<i>I charge you that on the 26th of September...</i>

1184
01:12:09,492 --> 01:12:12,995
<i>you did willfully murder
Charles Alexander Swann.</i>

1185
01:12:13,162 --> 01:12:16,665
<i>Do you wish to say anything
in answer to this charge?</i>

1186
01:12:20,169 --> 01:12:25,507
<i>And did you, at any time in your life,
meet this man, Swann?</i>

1187
01:12:27,260 --> 01:12:30,262
<i>You received a letter from Mr. Halliday.</i>

1188
01:12:30,430 --> 01:12:33,348
<i>This letter was found
in the dead man's pocket.</i>

1189
01:12:33,516 --> 01:12:36,268
<i>Now you say you did not know him?</i>

1190
01:12:38,980 --> 01:12:43,734
<i>Do you find the prisoner,
Margot Mary Wendice...</i>

1191
01:12:43,901 --> 01:12:47,279
<i>guilty or not guilty?</i>

1192
01:12:48,072 --> 01:12:49,990
<i>Guilty.</i>

1193
01:12:54,537 --> 01:12:56,663
<i>The sentence of this court...</i>

1194
01:12:56,831 --> 01:13:00,625
<i>is that you be taken to the place
from whence you came...</i>

1195
01:13:00,793 --> 01:13:04,421
<i>from thence to a place of lawful execution.</i>

1196
01:13:55,306 --> 01:13:57,849
- Oh, hello, Mark.
- Tony.

1197
01:13:58,726 --> 01:13:59,726
I--

1198
01:14:06,317 --> 01:14:10,112
Have you, uh, gotten any news
from the Home Secretary?

1199
01:14:18,496 --> 01:14:20,038
Then it's tomorrow?

1200
01:14:23,042 --> 01:14:26,461
Tony, I take it you'd do anything
to save her life.

1201
01:14:26,629 --> 01:14:29,589
- We've done everything.
- No, Tony, we haven't done everything.

1202
01:14:29,757 --> 01:14:32,717
I've been trying to figure out something for weeks
in case it came to this.

1203
01:14:33,553 --> 01:14:36,263
- Now I really believe it's her only chance.
- Let's have it.

1204
01:14:37,682 --> 01:14:40,517
Margot was convicted because nobody
believed her story.

1205
01:14:40,685 --> 01:14:43,270
The prosecution made out
she was telling one lie after another...

1206
01:14:43,437 --> 01:14:44,646
and the jury believed him.

1207
01:14:44,814 --> 01:14:47,607
But what did his case really amount to?
Just three things:

1208
01:14:47,775 --> 01:14:50,235
My letter, her stocking...

1209
01:14:50,403 --> 01:14:52,737
and the fact that because
no key was found on Swann...

1210
01:14:53,614 --> 01:14:55,991
- she must've let him in herself.
- Don't try and tell me--

1211
01:14:56,159 --> 01:14:59,119
Wait a minute, Tony. Now, hear me out.
This is where you come in.

1212
01:14:59,287 --> 01:15:00,996
You go to the police and tell them...

1213
01:15:01,164 --> 01:15:02,414
some story...

1214
01:15:02,582 --> 01:15:05,333
anything that will convince them
Margot wasn't lying after all.

1215
01:15:05,501 --> 01:15:08,211
The police aren't likely to believe
anything I might tell them.

1216
01:15:09,046 --> 01:15:11,381
Tony, I've been writing
this stuff for years.

1217
01:15:11,549 --> 01:15:13,884
I've figured out something
for you to tell them.

1218
01:15:14,051 --> 01:15:16,636
Now, let's take those points one by one.

1219
01:15:17,930 --> 01:15:21,766
Margot says she never let Swann in
through this door.

1220
01:15:22,518 --> 01:15:23,810
Okay.

1221
01:15:24,604 --> 01:15:26,354
He must have opened it somehow.

1222
01:15:27,148 --> 01:15:30,567
Suppose you tell the police
that you left your key out here somewhere.

1223
01:15:31,736 --> 01:15:34,112
Then Swann could have let himself in.

1224
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:37,240
- How'd he know it was there?
- You told him.

1225
01:15:37,408 --> 01:15:39,117
But I haven't met Swann in 20 years.

1226
01:15:40,203 --> 01:15:44,414
Tony, Swann is dead.
Now, we've gotta make the most of that.

1227
01:15:44,582 --> 01:15:46,041
You can tell any story about him now.

1228
01:15:46,209 --> 01:15:48,460
You can even say
that you two met somewhere...

1229
01:15:48,628 --> 01:15:50,837
and you planned this whole thing together.

1230
01:15:51,005 --> 01:15:52,088
Planned what?

1231
01:15:53,049 --> 01:15:55,467
Are you suggesting I arranged for Swann
to come here...

1232
01:15:55,635 --> 01:15:56,718
to blackmail her?

1233
01:15:56,886 --> 01:15:58,261
No.

1234
01:15:58,846 --> 01:16:00,472
To kill her.

1235
01:16:01,265 --> 01:16:03,975
- Kill Margot?
- That's it.

1236
01:16:04,143 --> 01:16:04,809
Why?

1237
01:16:04,977 --> 01:16:06,770
Because she said so.

1238
01:16:08,231 --> 01:16:11,274
"He came from behind the curtain...

1239
01:16:11,442 --> 01:16:14,903
and he tried to strangle me."
Okay, that's what he did.

1240
01:16:15,071 --> 01:16:16,988
All you gotta do is
support everything she said.

1241
01:16:17,156 --> 01:16:18,823
Don't you see? That's my whole idea.

1242
01:16:18,991 --> 01:16:20,450
What about your letter?

1243
01:16:20,618 --> 01:16:23,286
A man doesn't kill the person he's blackmailing.
Doesn't make sense.

1244
01:16:23,454 --> 01:16:27,457
Yes, I know. That worried me for a while too,
but I've got that licked.

1245
01:16:27,625 --> 01:16:28,333
You tell them...

1246
01:16:28,918 --> 01:16:31,544
that you stole her handbag yourself.

1247
01:16:31,712 --> 01:16:32,671
Why should I do that?

1248
01:16:34,757 --> 01:16:36,841
Because you wanted to read my letter.

1249
01:16:37,009 --> 01:16:39,719
When you had read it, you got mad
and decided to teach her a lesson.

1250
01:16:39,887 --> 01:16:41,471
So you wrote those blackmail notes.

1251
01:16:41,681 --> 01:16:43,056
Nobody can prove you didn't.

1252
01:16:43,224 --> 01:16:46,309
You can also say you never saw Swann
at Victoria Station.

1253
01:16:46,477 --> 01:16:49,271
You just invented that
to try to connect him with my letter.

1254
01:16:49,438 --> 01:16:51,106
Don't you see how it all hangs together?

1255
01:16:51,274 --> 01:16:53,942
But your letter was found in his pocket.

1256
01:16:54,110 --> 01:16:56,361
- Well, you put it there.
- When?

1257
01:16:57,113 --> 01:16:58,989
Sometime before the police arrived.

1258
01:17:01,617 --> 01:17:03,660
And you could have also...

1259
01:17:05,204 --> 01:17:06,246
planted the stockings...

1260
01:17:06,414 --> 01:17:07,205
at the same time.

1261
01:17:07,373 --> 01:17:09,541
But, Mark, why should I want anyone
to kill Margot?

1262
01:17:10,209 --> 01:17:11,710
I know, Tony.

1263
01:17:11,877 --> 01:17:15,338
It's tough for us to see
because we both love her...

1264
01:17:16,924 --> 01:17:18,091
but we need a reason now.

1265
01:17:18,592 --> 01:17:20,093
We need it badly.

1266
01:17:23,347 --> 01:17:26,474
Let's take one of the old stock motives.
Had Margot made a will?

1267
01:17:27,351 --> 01:17:30,020
- Yes, I believe she had.
- Who was the beneficiary?

1268
01:17:30,187 --> 01:17:31,479
Why, I am, I suppose.

1269
01:17:31,647 --> 01:17:32,731
There's your reason, Tony.

1270
01:17:32,898 --> 01:17:35,275
Thousands of husbands and wives
leave money to each other...

1271
01:17:35,443 --> 01:17:38,111
without murdering each other.
The police wouldn't believe it.

1272
01:17:38,279 --> 01:17:39,696
They'd take it for what it is:

1273
01:17:39,864 --> 01:17:42,365
A man trying desperately
to save his wife.

1274
01:17:42,533 --> 01:17:44,868
Well, I certainly think
it's worth that try.

1275
01:17:45,036 --> 01:17:48,038
Let's face it. They can't hang you
for a murder that never came off.

1276
01:17:48,205 --> 01:17:49,748
You'd get a few years in prison.

1277
01:17:50,791 --> 01:17:52,625
Thanks very much.

1278
01:17:53,044 --> 01:17:55,253
It's a small price to pay.
You'd be saving her life.

1279
01:17:55,504 --> 01:17:57,881
That's fine coming from you, Mark.

1280
01:17:58,049 --> 01:18:00,884
Her life wouldn't be in danger at all
if it hadn't been for you.

1281
01:18:01,969 --> 01:18:05,638
It's because of her association with you
that she lost the sympathy of the jury.

1282
01:18:07,808 --> 01:18:09,434
Don't get me wrong, Mark.

1283
01:18:09,602 --> 01:18:12,228
If there was the slightest chance
of this coming off, I'd do it...

1284
01:18:13,147 --> 01:18:14,898
but it's got to be convincing.

1285
01:18:15,066 --> 01:18:18,234
For instance, how could I possibly have
persuaded Swann to do a thing like this?

1286
01:18:18,944 --> 01:18:20,111
Well, you offered him money...

1287
01:18:20,279 --> 01:18:22,113
- or something.
- Money? I don't have any.

1288
01:18:22,281 --> 01:18:23,573
Yes, you'd have had Margot's.

1289
01:18:23,741 --> 01:18:26,326
It'd be months before
I get my hands on that...

1290
01:18:26,494 --> 01:18:28,912
and people don't commit murder on credit.

1291
01:18:29,789 --> 01:18:30,789
No, I'm....

1292
01:18:31,332 --> 01:18:34,125
I'm afraid you'll have to think
of something better than that.

1293
01:18:35,503 --> 01:18:36,878
I know you're trying to help...

1294
01:18:37,713 --> 01:18:39,964
but can you imagine anyone
believing a story like that?

1295
01:18:40,591 --> 01:18:43,134
Yes, I can, if you make them believe it.

1296
01:18:43,844 --> 01:18:46,012
I wouldn't know what to say.
You'd have to come with me.

1297
01:18:46,180 --> 01:18:47,514
Tony, that'd really be a mistake.

1298
01:18:47,681 --> 01:18:50,809
They know the kind of stuff I write.
We wouldn't stand a chance there--

1299
01:19:00,361 --> 01:19:01,444
Oh, hello, inspector.

1300
01:19:08,327 --> 01:19:10,161
Is it about my wife?

1301
01:19:10,830 --> 01:19:13,748
- No, sir, I'm afraid not.
- Then what is it?

1302
01:19:13,916 --> 01:19:17,210
Well, I'm making inquiries
in connection with a robbery...

1303
01:19:17,378 --> 01:19:19,546
that took place
about three weeks ago, sir.

1304
01:19:19,713 --> 01:19:21,673
Well, can't it wait a few days?

1305
01:19:21,841 --> 01:19:24,717
Of course, sir.
I'm very conscious of your position.

1306
01:19:24,885 --> 01:19:27,345
If I may, I'd like to say
how deeply sorry I am--

1307
01:19:27,513 --> 01:19:30,265
Yes, inspector, yes, all right.
Now, how can I help you?

1308
01:19:30,558 --> 01:19:32,851
The cashier of a factory in Ledbury Street...

1309
01:19:33,018 --> 01:19:34,310
was attacked in his office...

1310
01:19:34,478 --> 01:19:36,980
and two men made off
with several hundred pounds...

1311
01:19:37,148 --> 01:19:38,731
mostly in pound notes.

1312
01:19:38,899 --> 01:19:40,316
What is all this to do with me?

1313
01:19:40,484 --> 01:19:43,528
Well, in cases like this,
all police divisions are asked to keep a lookout...

1314
01:19:43,696 --> 01:19:45,905
for anyone spending large sums of money.

1315
01:19:46,073 --> 01:19:47,073
I see.

1316
01:19:47,241 --> 01:19:52,036
And I was wondering
if you'd sold anything recently for cash.

1317
01:19:52,204 --> 01:19:52,871
Why?

1318
01:19:53,664 --> 01:19:57,876
Well, my sergeant happened to be making inquiries
at Wales' Garage the other day...

1319
01:19:58,043 --> 01:20:02,005
and it appears that
you settled an account there recently...

1320
01:20:03,132 --> 01:20:04,632
for just over £60.

1321
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:06,968
Yes, I happened to have
quite a bit on me at the time...

1322
01:20:07,136 --> 01:20:08,428
so I settled for cash.

1323
01:20:08,888 --> 01:20:09,804
I see.

1324
01:20:09,972 --> 01:20:12,056
Had you just drawn this money
from your bank?

1325
01:20:13,058 --> 01:20:14,601
Have you been to my bank, inspector?

1326
01:20:15,352 --> 01:20:18,771
Yes. Yeah, as a matter of fact, I have, yeah.
Yeah, but they wouldn't help me.

1327
01:20:18,939 --> 01:20:21,399
Oh, bank statements are always jealously guarded.

1328
01:20:21,859 --> 01:20:24,527
Yes, but I'm rather surprised
you didn't come to me first.

1329
01:20:24,695 --> 01:20:29,073
It was only a routine matter after all.
I didn't want to disturb you.

1330
01:20:31,535 --> 01:20:32,702
Where did you get it, sir?

1331
01:20:33,329 --> 01:20:34,662
Is that any of your business?

1332
01:20:34,830 --> 01:20:37,749
Well, if it was stolen money,
yes, sir, it is my business.

1333
01:20:37,917 --> 01:20:40,293
- Do you mind if I smoke?
- Go ahead.

1334
01:20:40,628 --> 01:20:42,962
Do you really think
I've been receiving stolen money?

1335
01:20:43,130 --> 01:20:45,131
Well, until you tell me
where you got it...

1336
01:20:45,299 --> 01:20:47,550
I shan't know what to think, shall I?
You see...

1337
01:20:47,718 --> 01:20:49,969
if you got this money
from someone you didn't know...

1338
01:20:50,804 --> 01:20:53,556
I mean, that might be
the very person we're looking for.

1339
01:20:54,475 --> 01:20:55,225
Hello.

1340
01:20:57,520 --> 01:20:58,937
- Is this yours, sir?
- What is it?

1341
01:20:59,104 --> 01:21:00,188
Somebody's latchkey.

1342
01:21:00,356 --> 01:21:02,148
It was lying on the floor just here.

1343
01:21:05,611 --> 01:21:07,654
No. Mine's here.

1344
01:21:12,910 --> 01:21:16,538
No. No, it's not yours.
It may be mine then.

1345
01:21:20,376 --> 01:21:23,670
Yes. Yes, it is mine. 
Yes, it must have dropped out of the pocket.

1346
01:21:23,837 --> 01:21:25,588
There's a small hole there.

1347
01:21:25,756 --> 01:21:29,342
That's the trouble with these latchkeys,
they're all alike.

1348
01:21:29,510 --> 01:21:30,635
I'm sorry, you were saying?

1349
01:21:30,803 --> 01:21:33,721
- I don't think I was, was I?
- Oh, yes, about that money.

1350
01:21:33,889 --> 01:21:36,015
I'd be grateful if you'd tell me
where you got it.

1351
01:21:36,183 --> 01:21:38,935
After all, £100 is quite a lot
to carry around.

1352
01:21:39,103 --> 01:21:42,689
- You said 60 a moment ago.
- Did I? Oh, yes.

1353
01:21:42,856 --> 01:21:47,277
Yes, my sergeant decided to dig a little deeper
before he put in his report.

1354
01:21:47,611 --> 01:21:50,238
He said that you also paid a bill
at your tailor's...

1355
01:21:50,406 --> 01:21:52,115
and another for wines and spirits.

1356
01:21:52,283 --> 01:21:53,992
I'm sorry he went to all that trouble.

1357
01:21:54,159 --> 01:21:56,035
Had he come to me,
I could've explained at once.

1358
01:21:56,203 --> 01:21:59,247
I simply won rather a large sum
at dog racing.

1359
01:21:59,415 --> 01:22:00,373
Over £100?

1360
01:22:00,541 --> 01:22:03,418
Yes, over £100.
It has been done before, you know.

1361
01:22:03,586 --> 01:22:06,421
Yes, well, why didn't you
tell me this straightaway then?

1362
01:22:06,589 --> 01:22:09,173
Well, I was rather ashamed
of being caught going to dog racing...

1363
01:22:09,341 --> 01:22:11,593
when my wife is under sentence of death.

1364
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:15,972
Yes, I know how it is.
It helps to take your mind off things.

1365
01:22:16,140 --> 01:22:18,099
Well, that answers everything, doesn't it?

1366
01:22:18,267 --> 01:22:20,018
I'm sorry to have to bother you
at this time.

1367
01:22:20,185 --> 01:22:21,144
Not at all, inspector.

1368
01:22:21,312 --> 01:22:22,687
Not at all.

1369
01:22:27,610 --> 01:22:30,403
Uh, there's just one other thing, sir.

1370
01:22:30,571 --> 01:22:33,531
Have you a small, blue attaché case?

1371
01:22:33,699 --> 01:22:35,992
- Don't say you found it already.
- Why, have you lost it?

1372
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:38,703
Yes. I was going to report it
this afternoon. I think...

1373
01:22:38,871 --> 01:22:40,622
- I left it in a taxi.
- I see.

1374
01:22:41,457 --> 01:22:44,751
Well, we-- We must try and get it back,
mustn't we?

1375
01:22:44,918 --> 01:22:46,336
Where did you pick the taxi up, sir?

1376
01:22:46,503 --> 01:22:48,838
Uh, Hyde Park Corner
about half an hour ago.

1377
01:22:49,006 --> 01:22:49,714
Anything valuable?

1378
01:22:49,882 --> 01:22:52,050
- No, a few books and, uh--
- Any money?

1379
01:22:52,217 --> 01:22:54,135
Two or £3 in an envelope, I believe.

1380
01:22:54,303 --> 01:22:55,303
Not 2- or 300?

1381
01:22:55,471 --> 01:22:56,971
No, I'm afraid not.

1382
01:22:57,139 --> 01:22:58,348
Just as well.

1383
01:22:58,515 --> 01:23:01,392
Inspector, how did you find out
about the attaché case?

1384
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:04,187
The wine shop mentioned you had it
when you paid your bill.

1385
01:23:04,355 --> 01:23:06,856
So my sergeant checked back
on your garage and your tailor.

1386
01:23:07,024 --> 01:23:09,442
They both remembered you having it
when you paid them.

1387
01:23:09,610 --> 01:23:12,445
- Yes, I use it instead of a briefcase.
- Mm. Well...

1388
01:23:12,696 --> 01:23:15,073
these taxi men are pretty good
at turning things in.

1389
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:17,033
I hope you'll find it all right, sir.

1390
01:23:19,411 --> 01:23:20,745
Inspector, before you go...

1391
01:23:22,665 --> 01:23:25,958
I think Mr. Wendice
has something to tell you.

1392
01:23:26,126 --> 01:23:27,460
Has he?

1393
01:23:28,545 --> 01:23:31,005
Then I'd like to show you
something in here, sir.

1394
01:23:41,308 --> 01:23:44,227
No wonder you couldn't bear
to sleep in her bedroom.

1395
01:23:44,395 --> 01:23:47,021
There must be over £500 here.

1396
01:23:48,941 --> 01:23:50,441
Where did you get it?

1397
01:23:51,735 --> 01:23:53,486
Well, I can tell you why he got it.

1398
01:23:53,654 --> 01:23:55,863
This money was to have been paid
to a man named Swann...

1399
01:23:56,031 --> 01:24:00,118
after he murdered Mrs. Wendice.
But as you know, there was an accident...

1400
01:24:00,285 --> 01:24:02,704
so it wasn't necessary
to pay Swann after all.

1401
01:24:02,871 --> 01:24:05,707
Obviously, he couldn't produce all this
without questions being asked...

1402
01:24:05,874 --> 01:24:07,333
so he lived on it.

1403
01:24:07,501 --> 01:24:10,378
He's been living on it
since the 27th of March.

1404
01:24:10,546 --> 01:24:12,046
Well, Mr. Wendice?

1405
01:24:12,214 --> 01:24:14,924
Before you came, inspector,
he was trying to persuade me...

1406
01:24:15,092 --> 01:24:19,178
to go to the police
with the most fantastic story you ever heard.

1407
01:24:19,346 --> 01:24:22,849
Apparently, I bribed Swann
to murder my wife so that....

1408
01:24:23,016 --> 01:24:24,934
Correct me if I go wrong, Mark.

1409
01:24:25,102 --> 01:24:27,437
So that I could inherit all her money.

1410
01:24:27,604 --> 01:24:31,649
And that isn't all.
You remember Mr. Halliday's letter?

1411
01:24:31,817 --> 01:24:34,777
Well, apparently, Swann didn't steal it, I did...

1412
01:24:34,987 --> 01:24:37,029
and I wrote those two blackmail notes...

1413
01:24:37,281 --> 01:24:41,033
and I kept Mr. Halliday's letter
and planted it on the body.

1414
01:24:42,035 --> 01:24:43,953
- And the stocking--
- Oh, yes, the stocking.

1415
01:24:44,121 --> 01:24:46,914
Perhaps I'd better tell this, Mark.
Might sound more like a confession.

1416
01:24:47,082 --> 01:24:49,917
I substituted.... Is that the right word?

1417
01:24:50,085 --> 01:24:53,755
Yes. I substituted my wife's other stocking
for the one that.... Uh--

1418
01:24:53,922 --> 01:24:55,047
You do follow me, don't you?

1419
01:24:55,549 --> 01:24:56,716
What else, Mark?

1420
01:24:57,843 --> 01:24:58,926
He told Swann...

1421
01:24:59,094 --> 01:25:01,262
he'd hide his key somewhere out here...

1422
01:25:01,430 --> 01:25:03,723
probably up on this ledge.

1423
01:25:04,641 --> 01:25:05,933
Swann let himself in.

1424
01:25:06,769 --> 01:25:09,395
He hid behind the curtains.
Then Wendice phoned from the hotel.

1425
01:25:09,563 --> 01:25:10,980
- That brought her--
- Just one moment.

1426
01:25:11,148 --> 01:25:12,899
If Swann had used Mr. Wendice's key...

1427
01:25:13,066 --> 01:25:15,067
it would still have been on him
when he died.

1428
01:25:15,235 --> 01:25:18,738
Besides, how did Mr. Wendice get in
when he returned from the hotel?

1429
01:25:18,906 --> 01:25:20,364
Well, she could have let him in.

1430
01:25:20,532 --> 01:25:23,409
He could've taken his key from Swann's pocket
before the police got here.

1431
01:25:23,577 --> 01:25:27,246
But he let himself in with his own key.
That came out in the trial.

1432
01:25:27,414 --> 01:25:28,164
Don't you remember?

1433
01:25:28,332 --> 01:25:31,125
Come on, Mark. Your move.

1434
01:25:33,545 --> 01:25:34,796
Uh....

1435
01:25:36,089 --> 01:25:40,343
Swann could have taken the key
down from here, unlocked the door...

1436
01:25:40,511 --> 01:25:42,970
and then replaced the key on the ledge
before he came in.

1437
01:25:43,430 --> 01:25:45,097
All right. This is very interesting...

1438
01:25:45,265 --> 01:25:48,059
but it isn't getting me any nearer
what I came to find out.

1439
01:25:48,227 --> 01:25:50,770
But this is a question of life and death.
What else matters?

1440
01:25:50,938 --> 01:25:53,397
What matters to me is
where Mr. Wendice got this money.

1441
01:25:53,565 --> 01:25:54,941
That's all I want to know.

1442
01:26:02,950 --> 01:26:04,992
Just a moment, please, sir.

1443
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:12,792
Inspector, wait a minute. Look at this.

1444
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:15,253
The last check he wrote
was on the 26th of March...

1445
01:26:15,462 --> 01:26:18,339
the day before this all happened.
He's been living off it ever since.

1446
01:26:19,424 --> 01:26:21,634
- There's his bank--
- Mr. Halliday.

1447
01:26:21,802 --> 01:26:23,219
Sorry.

1448
01:26:25,722 --> 01:26:30,059
He hasn't drawn any large sums from his bank.
Nothing over £53.

1449
01:26:32,479 --> 01:26:35,815
But look, inspector, practically every week.

1450
01:26:35,983 --> 01:26:37,441
Thirty-five pounds, 40...

1451
01:26:37,609 --> 01:26:39,151
£45, 50.

1452
01:26:39,319 --> 01:26:40,486
He could've saved it up.

1453
01:26:40,654 --> 01:26:42,780
Of course I could've been
planning all this for years.

1454
01:26:43,156 --> 01:26:44,323
Then where did you get it?

1455
01:26:44,992 --> 01:26:47,994
Do you really want to know?
I warn you, you won't like it, Mark.

1456
01:26:48,370 --> 01:26:49,036
Come on.

1457
01:26:50,414 --> 01:26:52,164
All right, you asked for it.

1458
01:26:52,332 --> 01:26:54,333
When she called me back
from the party that night...

1459
01:26:54,501 --> 01:26:58,254
I found her kneeling beside Swann's body,
going through his pockets.

1460
01:26:58,422 --> 01:27:02,091
She kept saying he had something of hers,
but she couldn't find it.

1461
01:27:02,259 --> 01:27:05,720
She was almost hysterical.
That's why I wouldn't let the police question her.

1462
01:27:05,888 --> 01:27:09,432
In the state she was in,
she would have told every lie under the sun.

1463
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:13,686
The next morning she showed me the money
just as it is now, all in £1 notes.

1464
01:27:14,229 --> 01:27:18,232
And she said, "If anything happens to me,
don't let them find this."

1465
01:27:19,109 --> 01:27:22,278
Well, after she was arrested,
I took the money in that case...

1466
01:27:22,446 --> 01:27:25,364
to Charing Cross Station
and left it in the checkroom.

1467
01:27:25,532 --> 01:27:29,827
Whenever I needed money, I took it out
and left it in some other checkroom.

1468
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:33,372
I knew if you had found it,
she wouldn't stand a chance.

1469
01:27:33,540 --> 01:27:37,668
You see, she was just about to give it to him
when she killed him instead.

1470
01:27:38,545 --> 01:27:40,963
You don't expect anyone
to believe this, do you?

1471
01:27:41,214 --> 01:27:44,050
I have really no idea.
What about it, inspector?

1472
01:27:44,843 --> 01:27:46,177
Hm?

1473
01:27:46,345 --> 01:27:48,846
Well, I must say I suspected something like that.

1474
01:27:49,556 --> 01:27:51,474
You're not even gonna check on this?

1475
01:27:51,642 --> 01:27:52,808
She's being hanged tomorrow.

1476
01:27:52,976 --> 01:27:55,144
Look, all this has been
out of my hands for months.

1477
01:27:55,312 --> 01:27:56,979
There's been a trial and an appeal--

1478
01:27:57,147 --> 01:27:59,315
Oh, of course it wouldn't mean much to you.

1479
01:27:59,483 --> 01:28:01,567
You'd have to admit
you arrested the wrong person.

1480
01:28:03,403 --> 01:28:04,820
I think you'd better go.

1481
01:28:04,988 --> 01:28:06,906
You bet I'll go.

1482
01:28:09,534 --> 01:28:11,619
But you've made one mistake.

1483
01:28:11,787 --> 01:28:13,537
What'll happen when Margot
hears about this?

1484
01:28:13,705 --> 01:28:16,832
- She'll deny it, of course.
- And perhaps she'll change her will.

1485
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,377
You'll have done it all for nothing, Tony.

1486
01:28:24,466 --> 01:28:27,093
If I'd told that story of his,
would anyone have believed me?

1487
01:28:28,053 --> 01:28:29,553
No, not a chance.

1488
01:28:29,721 --> 01:28:33,808
Before nearly every execution,
someone comes forward like this.

1489
01:28:33,976 --> 01:28:37,228
This must have been very distressing for you,
coming as it did.

1490
01:28:37,396 --> 01:28:40,815
You suppose they'd let him see her?
I don't want her upset just now.

1491
01:28:40,983 --> 01:28:44,193
Have a word with your lawyer.
He might be able to prevent it.

1492
01:28:44,361 --> 01:28:47,154
I should get all that money into the bank
before somebody pinches it.

1493
01:28:47,322 --> 01:28:49,073
Thank you. I think I will.

1494
01:28:50,492 --> 01:28:53,577
I hope Mr. Halliday's not waiting outside
to see me.

1495
01:28:53,745 --> 01:28:56,664
Would you mind just taking a look, sir,
to make sure he's gone?

1496
01:29:06,967 --> 01:29:08,009
All clear.

1497
01:29:08,176 --> 01:29:10,928
Good. Oh, by the way, sir,
I was asked to tell you.

1498
01:29:11,096 --> 01:29:14,306
There are a few things belonging to Mrs. Wendice
at the police station.

1499
01:29:14,474 --> 01:29:15,307
What sort of things?

1500
01:29:15,475 --> 01:29:18,019
Oh, just some books and a handbag,
I believe.

1501
01:29:18,186 --> 01:29:20,187
They'd like you to come
and collect them sometime.

1502
01:29:20,355 --> 01:29:23,399
- You mean after tomorrow?
- Yes, or today, if you like.

1503
01:29:23,567 --> 01:29:25,735
Just ask the desk sergeant.
He knows all about it.

1504
01:29:25,902 --> 01:29:27,528
- Yes.
- Well, goodbye, Mr. Wendice.

1505
01:29:27,696 --> 01:29:29,989
I don't suppose we shall meet again.

1506
01:29:30,157 --> 01:29:32,616
Goodbye, inspector, and thank you very much.

1507
01:31:20,600 --> 01:31:22,017
<i>Maida Vale Police.</i>

1508
01:31:22,185 --> 01:31:25,104
Chief inspector here.
Give me Sergeant O'Brien, quick.

1509
01:31:25,272 --> 01:31:26,105
<i>O'Brien here.</i>

1510
01:31:26,273 --> 01:31:28,858
Hubbard. Look, O'Brien,
I've got back in again.

1511
01:31:29,025 --> 01:31:30,526
Start the ball rolling.

1512
01:31:30,694 --> 01:31:31,819
<i>Right away, sir.</i>

1513
01:31:43,331 --> 01:31:47,001
Inspector Hubbard, it's me,
Mark Halliday.

1514
01:31:49,296 --> 01:31:51,130
Now, what are you up to?
What's the idea?

1515
01:31:51,298 --> 01:31:53,132
- What are you doing here?
- Never mind that.

1516
01:31:53,300 --> 01:31:55,092
- I wondered why--
- Get out of here, quick.

1517
01:31:55,260 --> 01:31:56,260
- Listen--
- Shut up.

1518
01:31:56,428 --> 01:31:58,846
You want to save Mrs. Wendice?
Keep quiet. Let me handle this.

1519
01:31:59,890 --> 01:32:01,515
How are you possibly gonna--?

1520
01:33:28,311 --> 01:33:30,062
Look, what is all this?

1521
01:33:30,230 --> 01:33:32,106
They talk about flat-footed policemen.

1522
01:33:32,274 --> 01:33:35,901
May the saints protect us
from the gifted amateur.

1523
01:33:46,538 --> 01:33:49,790
You'd better prepare yourself
for a surprise, Mr. Halliday.

1524
01:33:58,174 --> 01:33:59,758
Margot.

1525
01:34:02,304 --> 01:34:03,595
Hello, Mark.

1526
01:34:05,223 --> 01:34:06,098
Where's Tony?

1527
01:34:06,266 --> 01:34:09,810
He-- He's gone out.

1528
01:34:09,978 --> 01:34:11,186
When will he be back?

1529
01:34:11,354 --> 01:34:13,105
We're not sure.

1530
01:34:13,273 --> 01:34:15,149
Was that you who rang just now?

1531
01:34:15,317 --> 01:34:18,736
Yes. Why didn't you let me in?

1532
01:34:18,903 --> 01:34:20,863
You've got a key.
Why didn't you use it?

1533
01:34:21,031 --> 01:34:25,367
- I did, but it didn't fit the lock.
- No. And you know why, don't you?

1534
01:34:25,535 --> 01:34:28,579
No, I don't.
Has the lock been changed?

1535
01:34:28,747 --> 01:34:30,748
May I have your bag a moment?

1536
01:34:36,838 --> 01:34:38,589
Whose key is this?

1537
01:34:39,174 --> 01:34:42,801
I thought it was mine.
I don't know.

1538
01:34:48,975 --> 01:34:50,434
What's going on here?

1539
01:34:56,274 --> 01:34:57,983
Your husband's explained this, you know.

1540
01:34:58,443 --> 01:35:00,736
You can tell us all about it now.

1541
01:35:00,904 --> 01:35:04,031
What is it? I don't understand.

1542
01:35:04,866 --> 01:35:07,993
No, I don't believe you do.

1543
01:35:11,498 --> 01:35:13,415
- Pearson?
- Yes, sir.

1544
01:35:14,542 --> 01:35:16,460
Take this handbag
back to the police station...

1545
01:35:16,628 --> 01:35:18,003
and get that car out of the way.

1546
01:35:18,171 --> 01:35:20,422
- Yes, sir.
- Wait a minute, you clod.

1547
01:35:20,590 --> 01:35:24,176
You can't walk down the street like that.
You'll be arrested.

1548
01:35:24,344 --> 01:35:26,095
Well, here. Put it in this.

1549
01:35:26,721 --> 01:35:28,597
Margot, how did you get here?

1550
01:35:28,765 --> 01:35:30,724
I don't know.

1551
01:35:31,976 --> 01:35:35,062
About an hour ago,
the warden came to see me...

1552
01:35:35,230 --> 01:35:37,606
and just said I was to be taken home.

1553
01:35:37,774 --> 01:35:40,609
And then two detectives brought me here.

1554
01:35:41,069 --> 01:35:46,031
They said I could go,
but I couldn't get that door open.

1555
01:35:47,158 --> 01:35:50,452
Where's Tony?
He was supposed to visit me this morning...

1556
01:35:50,620 --> 01:35:52,704
and they said he couldn't come.

1557
01:35:53,248 --> 01:35:55,165
Has anything happened to him?

1558
01:35:55,333 --> 01:35:57,876
No. Nothing.

1559
01:35:58,253 --> 01:35:59,711
Inspector, I don't wanna interfere...

1560
01:35:59,879 --> 01:36:02,381
but do you think you could tell us
what you're up to?

1561
01:36:02,549 --> 01:36:06,552
Mrs. Wendice, what I'm about to tell you
may come as a shock.

1562
01:36:07,303 --> 01:36:08,345
Yes?

1563
01:36:08,513 --> 01:36:12,808
We strongly suspect that your husband
had planned to murder you.

1564
01:36:13,476 --> 01:36:16,687
Tony arranged for Swann
to come here that night and kill you.

1565
01:36:18,690 --> 01:36:20,649
How long have you known this?

1566
01:36:20,817 --> 01:36:22,234
Did you suspect it yourself?

1567
01:36:22,402 --> 01:36:25,737
No, never. And yet....

1568
01:36:28,700 --> 01:36:30,951
What's the matter with me, Mark?

1569
01:36:32,579 --> 01:36:35,247
I don't seem able to feel anything.

1570
01:36:36,458 --> 01:36:39,251
Shouldn't I break down or something?

1571
01:36:39,502 --> 01:36:41,587
It's delayed action, that's all.

1572
01:36:41,754 --> 01:36:45,632
In a couple of days, you're gonna have
the most wonderful breakdown.

1573
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:46,842
When did you find out, sir?

1574
01:36:47,010 --> 01:36:50,971
Well, the first clue
came quite by accident.

1575
01:36:51,139 --> 01:36:52,764
We discovered that your husband...

1576
01:36:52,932 --> 01:36:56,268
had been spending a large number of pound notes
all over the place.

1577
01:36:56,436 --> 01:36:58,270
It ran into over £300.

1578
01:36:58,438 --> 01:37:01,648
And it appeared to have started
at about the time you were arrested.

1579
01:37:01,816 --> 01:37:05,986
Now, I had to find out
where he got that money and how.

1580
01:37:06,154 --> 01:37:07,321
And then I remembered...

1581
01:37:07,489 --> 01:37:10,240
that after you were arrested,
we searched this flat.

1582
01:37:10,408 --> 01:37:13,702
And I saw a copy of his bank statement
in that desk.

1583
01:37:13,870 --> 01:37:17,581
So yesterday afternoon, I went to the prison
and asked to see your handbag.

1584
01:37:17,749 --> 01:37:21,336
While I was doing this,
I managed to lift your latchkey. 

1585
01:37:22,504 --> 01:37:25,672
Highly irregular, of course,
but my blood was up.

1586
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:28,217
And then this morning
when your husband was out...

1587
01:37:28,384 --> 01:37:30,844
I came back here
to look at his statement.

1588
01:37:31,012 --> 01:37:33,597
I never saw it,
because I never got through that door.

1589
01:37:33,765 --> 01:37:38,018
You see, the key that I'd taken
from your handbag...

1590
01:37:38,186 --> 01:37:39,686
didn't fit the lock.

1591
01:37:46,903 --> 01:37:47,569
Williams?

1592
01:37:48,138 --> 01:37:48,987
Wendice. 

1593
01:38:29,011 --> 01:38:30,737
Oh, that was a near one.

1594
01:38:42,375 --> 01:38:44,251
<i>Maida Vale Police. O'Brien speaking.</i>

1595
01:38:44,419 --> 01:38:47,170
Hubbard. Look, O'Brien,
he's found out about his raincoat.

1596
01:38:47,338 --> 01:38:51,341
He just came back and couldn't get in.
I think he's on his way to the station now.

1597
01:38:51,509 --> 01:38:53,719
- Has Pearson arrived with the handbag?
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>

1598
01:38:53,886 --> 01:38:57,764
Good. Now, listen.
Give Wendice those books and the handbag...

1599
01:38:57,932 --> 01:39:00,017
and make sure he sees the key.

1600
01:39:00,435 --> 01:39:03,437
Better make him check the contents
and sign for them.

1601
01:39:03,605 --> 01:39:07,649
If he wants his own key and raincoat,
tell him I've gone to Glasgow.

1602
01:39:07,817 --> 01:39:08,734
<i>Right, sir.</i>

1603
01:39:08,901 --> 01:39:10,277
- Any questions?
- <i>No.</i>

1604
01:39:10,445 --> 01:39:13,530
- Right. Call me back when he leaves.
- <i>Right, sir.</i>

1605
01:39:16,409 --> 01:39:18,660
Well, Mr. Halliday, have you got it?

1606
01:39:18,828 --> 01:39:20,120
I don't think so.

1607
01:39:20,288 --> 01:39:22,331
Where's Mrs. Wendice's key?

1608
01:39:28,713 --> 01:39:30,964
It took me just half an hour to find it.

1609
01:39:35,178 --> 01:39:38,388
But if it was there,
why didn't Wendice use it just now?

1610
01:39:38,556 --> 01:39:40,682
Didn't use it because
he doesn't realize it's there.

1611
01:39:40,850 --> 01:39:45,187
He still thinks it's in his wife's handbag.
You see, you were very nearly right.

1612
01:39:45,355 --> 01:39:47,564
He told Swann that he would leave your latchkey...

1613
01:39:47,732 --> 01:39:49,566
under the stair carpet, Mrs. Wendice...

1614
01:39:49,734 --> 01:39:53,445
and told him to return it
to the same place when he left.

1615
01:39:53,613 --> 01:39:55,781
But as Swann was killed,
we naturally assumed...

1616
01:39:55,948 --> 01:39:58,050
that your key would still be
in one of Swann's pockets. 

1617
01:39:59,118 --> 01:40:00,827
That was his little mistake...

1618
01:40:00,995 --> 01:40:04,414
because Swann had done
exactly as you suggested, Mr. Halliday.

1619
01:40:04,582 --> 01:40:06,792
He unlocked the door...

1620
01:40:06,959 --> 01:40:10,629
then returned the key
before he came in.

1621
01:40:10,797 --> 01:40:12,714
And it's been out there ever since.

1622
01:40:12,882 --> 01:40:16,134
And the key Wendice took out
of Swann's pocket...

1623
01:40:16,302 --> 01:40:17,719
and returned to her handbag was--

1624
01:40:17,887 --> 01:40:20,305
Swann's own latchkey.

1625
01:40:23,059 --> 01:40:26,395
Mind you, even I didn't guess that at once.
Extraordinary.

1626
01:40:26,562 --> 01:40:30,482
You know, it had always puzzled me
that no key was found on Swann's body.

1627
01:40:30,650 --> 01:40:33,402
After all, most men
carry a latchkey about with them.

1628
01:40:33,569 --> 01:40:35,904
And then I had a brainwave.

1629
01:40:36,114 --> 01:40:38,657
I took the key that was in your handbag...

1630
01:40:38,825 --> 01:40:43,078
to his girlfriend's, Mrs. Van Dorn's,
and unlocked the door of her flat...

1631
01:40:43,246 --> 01:40:47,165
and then I borrowed her telephone
and called Scotland Yard.

1632
01:40:47,750 --> 01:40:49,334
Why did you bring me here?

1633
01:40:49,544 --> 01:40:51,128
Because you were the only other person...

1634
01:40:51,295 --> 01:40:53,505
who could possibly have left
that key outside.

1635
01:40:53,673 --> 01:40:56,133
I had to find out
if you knew it was there.

1636
01:40:57,677 --> 01:40:59,302
Suppose I had known?

1637
01:41:02,348 --> 01:41:03,181
You didn't.

1638
01:41:06,936 --> 01:41:09,104
- Mark.
- Yes, darling?

1639
01:41:09,272 --> 01:41:12,315
I think I'm going to have that breakdown.

1640
01:41:17,572 --> 01:41:19,197
- <i>Inspector Hubbard?</i>
- O'Brien?

1641
01:41:19,365 --> 01:41:22,242
- <i>Yes. He's just left the station.</i>
- Right.

1642
01:41:28,416 --> 01:41:30,917
Try and hang on just a little longer.

1643
01:41:33,629 --> 01:41:37,883
Williams, he's just left the station.
Give me a thump if he comes this way.

1644
01:41:38,050 --> 01:41:41,136
- Can I have a handkerchief?
- What happens now?

1645
01:41:41,304 --> 01:41:43,430
Sooner or later, he'll come back here.

1646
01:41:43,598 --> 01:41:46,600
As I've pinched his latchkey,
he'll try the one in the handbag.

1647
01:41:46,768 --> 01:41:49,269
When that doesn't fit,
he'll realize his mistake...

1648
01:41:49,437 --> 01:41:52,105
put two and two together,
and look under the stair carpet.

1649
01:41:52,273 --> 01:41:55,525
But if he doesn't do that, all this
is pure guesswork. We can't prove a thing.

1650
01:41:55,693 --> 01:41:59,070
That's perfectly true,
but once he opens that door...

1651
01:41:59,238 --> 01:42:01,573
- we shall know everything.
- What will you do then?

1652
01:42:01,741 --> 01:42:04,910
I'm to phone the Home Secretary personally.
He's standing by for a call now.

1653
01:42:05,077 --> 01:42:08,747
- And Mrs. Wendice?
- Will have nothing else to fear.

1654
01:42:11,667 --> 01:42:13,376
All right, Margot?

1655
01:42:13,544 --> 01:42:15,045
Yes, I'm all right.

1656
01:42:15,213 --> 01:42:17,130
Quiet now, you two.

1657
01:42:52,834 --> 01:42:53,750
What's he doing? 

1658
01:42:53,918 --> 01:42:55,961
He's wondering why that key doesn't fit.

1659
01:42:56,671 --> 01:42:59,422
He's going around to the back entrance.
He's stopped again.

1660
01:42:59,590 --> 01:43:01,216
He's looking at the handbag now.

1661
01:43:01,968 --> 01:43:06,054
He's trying to remember
when he put the key back in there.

1662
01:43:08,933 --> 01:43:09,891
Now he's given up.

1663
01:43:10,518 --> 01:43:13,979
I'm afraid we've had it this time.
He's going way down the street.

1664
01:43:14,146 --> 01:43:14,813
Hold it.

1665
01:43:15,481 --> 01:43:19,109
He's stopped again. He's turning round.

1666
01:43:19,944 --> 01:43:21,570
He's staring at the key.

1667
01:43:23,406 --> 01:43:26,366
Of course. That's Swann's key, isn't it?

1668
01:43:27,243 --> 01:43:28,034
Now he's got it.

1669
01:43:28,995 --> 01:43:30,203
He's coming back fast.

1670
01:43:32,456 --> 01:43:34,207
He's remembered.

1671
01:44:28,262 --> 01:44:32,641
As you said, Mark, it, uh,
might work out on paper but, uh--

1672
01:44:32,808 --> 01:44:34,976
Congratulations, Inspector.

1673
01:44:35,144 --> 01:44:36,811
Oh, by the way....

1674
01:44:45,196 --> 01:44:46,363
Oh, how about you, Margot?

1675
01:44:48,240 --> 01:44:50,367
Yes, I could do with something.

1676
01:44:50,534 --> 01:44:52,452
- Mark?
- So could I.

1677
01:44:52,620 --> 01:44:54,454
I suppose you're still on duty, inspector.

1678
