00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:12,105
<i>Sometimes,
I think I'm cursed.</i>

3
00:01:12,108 --> 00:01:15,740
<i>Because of something that
happened before I was even born.</i>

4
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:19,094
<i>See, a long time ago,
there was this family.</i>

5
00:01:20,248 --> 00:01:23,115
<i>The</i> papa, <i>he was a musician.</i>

6
00:01:23,117 --> 00:01:26,968
<i>He and his family would sing and
dance and count their blessings.</i>

7
00:01:28,124 --> 00:01:31,757
<i>But he also had a dream.
To play for the world.</i>

8
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:37,130
<i>And one day,</i>

9
00:01:37,133 --> 00:01:41,133
<i>he left with his guitar
and never returned.</i>

10
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:51,144
<i>And the</i> mama...

11
00:01:51,147 --> 00:01:53,813
<i>She didn't have time to cry
over that walk-away musician.</i>

12
00:01:56,283 --> 00:02:01,255
<i>After banishing all music from
her life she found a way...</i>

13
00:02:01,257 --> 00:02:02,871
<i>to provide for her daughter.</i>

14
00:02:06,694 --> 00:02:10,162
<i>She rolled up her sleeves
and she learned to make shoes.</i>

15
00:02:15,336 --> 00:02:17,602
<i>She could have made candy,</i>

16
00:02:17,604 --> 00:02:20,705
<i>or fireworks,
or sparkly underwear...</i>

17
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:26,026
<i>for wrestlers,
but no, she chose shoes.</i>

18
00:02:28,582 --> 00:02:30,898
<i>Then she taught her daughter
to make shoes.</i>

19
00:02:32,288 --> 00:02:34,869
<i>And later,
she taught her son-in-law.</i>

20
00:02:35,858 --> 00:02:37,858
<i>Then her grandkids
got roped in.</i>

21
00:02:39,495 --> 00:02:42,510
<i>As her family grew,
so did the business.</i>

22
00:02:43,866 --> 00:02:46,781
<i>Music had torn
her family apart.</i>

23
00:02:47,569 --> 00:02:49,917
<i>But shoes held
them all together.</i>

24
00:02:51,472 --> 00:02:53,239
<i>You see, that woman was</i>

25
00:02:53,241 --> 00:02:55,789
<i>my great-great-grandmother,</i>
Mama <i>Imelda.</i>

26
00:02:56,778 --> 00:02:59,612
<i>She died
way before I was born.</i>

27
00:02:59,614 --> 00:03:01,781
<i>But my family
still tells her story</i>

28
00:03:01,783 --> 00:03:04,350
<i>every year
on</i> Dia de los Muertos...

29
00:03:04,352 --> 00:03:05,851
<i>the Day of the Dead.</i>

30
00:03:05,854 --> 00:03:07,752
<i>And her little girl,</i>

31
00:03:07,754 --> 00:03:10,204
<i>she's my great-grandmother,</i>
Mama <i>Coco.</i>

32
00:03:10,892 --> 00:03:12,793
<i>Hola, Mama</i> Coco.

33
00:03:12,795 --> 00:03:15,329
How are you, Julio?

34
00:03:15,331 --> 00:03:17,495
<i>Actually, my name is Miguel.</i>

35
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:21,335
Mama <i>Coco has trouble
remembering things.</i>

36
00:03:21,337 --> 00:03:23,369
<i>But it's good
to talk to her anyway.</i>

37
00:03:23,371 --> 00:03:25,504
<i>So, I tell her
pretty much everything.</i>

38
00:03:25,507 --> 00:03:27,240
I used to run like this.

39
00:03:27,242 --> 00:03:30,244
But now I run like this
which is way faster.

40
00:03:30,246 --> 00:03:34,412
And the winner
is <i>Luchadora</i> Coco!

41
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:36,549
I have a dimple on this side,
but not on this side.

42
00:03:36,551 --> 00:03:38,517
Dimple, no dimple.
Dimple, no dimple.

43
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,752
Miguel, eat your food.

44
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:43,388
<i>My</i> abuelita,
<i>she's</i> Mama <i>Coco's daughter.</i>

45
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:46,524
Oh, you're a twig, <i>mijo.</i>
Have some more.

46
00:03:46,527 --> 00:03:47,660
No, <i>gracias.</i>

47
00:03:47,662 --> 00:03:50,895
I asked if you would
like more tamales!

48
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:52,265
<i>Si?</i>

49
00:03:52,267 --> 00:03:54,835
That's what
I thought you said!

50
00:03:54,837 --> 00:03:56,401
Abuelita <i>runs our house</i>

51
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:58,271
<i>just like</i> Mama <i>Imelda did.</i>

52
00:04:00,843 --> 00:04:02,275
No music!

53
00:04:03,578 --> 00:04:04,810
No music!

54
00:04:04,812 --> 00:04:06,679
<i>♪ Y aunque la vida ♪</i>

55
00:04:06,681 --> 00:04:07,981
No music!

56
00:04:07,983 --> 00:04:10,416
<i>I think we're
the only family in Mexico</i>

57
00:04:10,418 --> 00:04:12,386
<i>who hates music.</i>

58
00:04:12,388 --> 00:04:15,388
<i>And my family's fine
with that. But me...</i>

59
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:17,738
- Be back by lunch, <i>mijo.</i>
- Love you, <i>Mama.</i>

60
00:04:18,693 --> 00:04:21,309
<i>I am not like
the rest of my family!</i>

61
00:04:22,564 --> 00:04:23,963
- <i>Hola,</i> Miguel!
<i>- Hola!</i>

62
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:32,153
<i>- Muchas gracias.</i>
- <i>De nada,</i> Miguel.

63
00:04:36,077 --> 00:04:38,727
Hey! Dante!

64
00:04:39,813 --> 00:04:43,898
Sit. Down.
Roll over. Shake.

65
00:04:44,452 --> 00:04:45,685
Fist bump!

66
00:04:45,687 --> 00:04:47,901
Good boy, Dante!

67
00:04:51,558 --> 00:04:54,093
<i>I know I'm not
supposed to love music.</i>

68
00:04:54,095 --> 00:04:57,662
<i>But it's not my fault!
It's his!</i>

69
00:04:57,664 --> 00:04:59,564
<i>Ernesto de la Cruz.</i>

70
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:02,501
<i>The greatest musician
of all time.</i>

71
00:05:02,504 --> 00:05:04,437
Right here
in this very plaza,

72
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:08,006
Ernesto de la Cruz
took his first steps...

73
00:05:08,008 --> 00:05:12,578
toward becoming the most beloved
singer in Mexican history.

74
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:17,482
<i>He started out a total
nobody from Santa Cecilia, like me.</i>

75
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:21,520
<i>But when he played music, he made
people fall in love with him.</i>

76
00:05:21,523 --> 00:05:24,623
<i>He starred in movies.</i>

77
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:28,927
<i>He had the coolest guitar!
He could fly!</i>

78
00:05:28,929 --> 00:05:31,496
<i>And he wrote the best songs.</i>

79
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:33,733
<i>But my all-time favorite,
it's...</i>

80
00:05:33,735 --> 00:05:35,768
<i>♪ Remember me</i>

81
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:37,035
<i>♪ Remember me</i>

82
00:05:37,037 --> 00:05:38,903
<i>♪ Though I have
to say goodbye</i>

00:05:38,906 --> 00:05:40,773
<i>- ♪ Remember me

84
00:05:40,775 --> 00:05:44,677
<i>♪ Don't let it make you cry

85
00:05:44,679 --> 00:05:48,382
<i>♪ I hold you in my heart
I sing a secret song to you</i>

86
00:05:48,384 --> 00:05:51,384
<i>♪ Each night we are apart
Remember me</i>

87
00:05:51,386 --> 00:05:53,387
<i>♪ Though I have
to travel far</i>

88
00:05:53,389 --> 00:05:55,054
<i>- ♪ Remember me

89
00:05:55,056 --> 00:05:57,391
<i>♪ Each time you hear

90
00:05:57,393 --> 00:06:02,061
<i>♪ Know that I'm with you
the only way that I can be</i>

91
00:06:02,063 --> 00:06:06,064
<i>♪ Until you're
in my arms again ♪</i>

92
00:06:06,066 --> 00:06:08,882
<i>He lived the kind
of life you dream about.</i>

93
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:14,287
<i>Until 1942.</i>

94
00:06:15,977 --> 00:06:19,227
<i>When he was crushed
by a giant bell.</i>

95
00:06:19,981 --> 00:06:22,697
<i>I want to be just like him.</i>

96
00:06:28,655 --> 00:06:30,855
<i>Sometimes,
I look at de la Cruz</i>

97
00:06:30,858 --> 00:06:35,093
<i>and I get this feeling
like we're connected.</i>

98
00:06:35,095 --> 00:06:40,047
<i>Like if he could play music,
maybe someday, I could too.</i>

99
00:06:40,701 --> 00:06:42,702
If it wasn't for my family.

100
00:06:42,704 --> 00:06:45,104
- <i>Ay-ay-ay, muchacho.</i>
- Huh?

101
00:06:45,106 --> 00:06:47,540
I asked for a shoe shine
not your life story.

102
00:06:47,542 --> 00:06:49,575
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

103
00:06:49,577 --> 00:06:52,845
I just can't really talk about
any of this at home. So...

104
00:06:52,847 --> 00:06:53,845
If I were you,

105
00:06:53,847 --> 00:06:56,015
I'd march right up
to my family and say...

106
00:06:56,017 --> 00:06:58,618
"Hey, I'm a musician.
Deal with it."

107
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,553
I could never say that.

108
00:07:00,555 --> 00:07:02,088
You are a musician, no?

109
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:03,489
I don't know.

110
00:07:03,491 --> 00:07:06,025
I mean, I only
really play for myself.

111
00:07:06,027 --> 00:07:09,094
Ah! Did de la Cruz become
the world's best musician

112
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:10,997
by hiding his skills?

113
00:07:10,999 --> 00:07:14,133
No! He walked out
onto that plaza

114
00:07:14,135 --> 00:07:16,134
and he played out loud.

115
00:07:16,136 --> 00:07:18,604
<i>Mira, mira,</i> they're
setting up for tonight!

116
00:07:18,606 --> 00:07:21,007
The music competition
for <i>Dia de Muertos.</i>

117
00:07:21,009 --> 00:07:23,743
You want to be like your hero?
You should sign up!

118
00:07:23,745 --> 00:07:26,646
Uh-uh.
My family would freak!

119
00:07:26,648 --> 00:07:30,332
Look, if you're too scared then,
well, have fun making shoes.

120
00:07:31,119 --> 00:07:34,035
Come on, what did
de la Cruz always say?

121
00:07:34,189 --> 00:07:36,037
Seize your moment?

122
00:07:37,157 --> 00:07:39,157
Show me what
you got, <i>muchacho.</i>

123
00:07:40,628 --> 00:07:42,477
I'll be your first audience.

124
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:51,218
Miguel!

125
00:07:52,907 --> 00:07:55,041
- <i>Abuelita!</i>
- What are you doing here?

126
00:07:56,544 --> 00:07:57,977
You leave my grandson alone.

127
00:07:57,979 --> 00:07:59,078
<i>Dona,</i> please!

128
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,246
I was just getting
a shine.

129
00:08:00,248 --> 00:08:03,517
I know your tricks, mariachi.
What did he say to you?

130
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:05,050
He was just
showing me his guitar.

131
00:08:05,052 --> 00:08:06,852
Shame on you.

132
00:08:06,855 --> 00:08:12,158
My grandson is a sweet little
<i>angelito querido cielito.</i>

133
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,894
He wants no part
of your music, mariachi.

134
00:08:14,896 --> 00:08:16,227
You keep away from him.

135
00:08:19,933 --> 00:08:23,669
<i>Ay, pobrecito.</i>
Oh, <i>estas bien, mijo.</i>

136
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:27,907
You know better than to
be here in this place!

137
00:08:27,909 --> 00:08:31,293
You will come home. Now.

138
00:08:41,321 --> 00:08:42,954
How many times
have we told you?

139
00:08:42,956 --> 00:08:45,323
That plaza is
crawling with mariachis.

140
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:47,560
Yes, <i>Tio</i> Berto.

141
00:08:47,562 --> 00:08:50,695
- No, no, no, no, no!
- Ah! Go away, you. Go!

142
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:51,963
It's just Dante.

143
00:08:51,965 --> 00:08:54,099
Never name a street dog.

144
00:08:54,101 --> 00:08:57,151
They'll follow you forever.
Now, go get my shoe.

145
00:09:03,278 --> 00:09:06,012
I found your son
in Mariachi Plaza.

146
00:09:06,014 --> 00:09:07,078
<i>Ay,</i> Miguel!

147
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,714
You know how <i>Abuelita</i>
feels about the plaza.

148
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:11,017
I was just shining shoes.

149
00:09:11,019 --> 00:09:12,584
A musician's shoes!

150
00:09:14,254 --> 00:09:16,722
But the plaza's where
all the foot traffic is.

151
00:09:16,724 --> 00:09:20,358
If <i>Abuelita</i> says no more
plaza, then no more plaza.

152
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,762
- But what about tonight?
- What's tonight?

153
00:09:22,764 --> 00:09:25,597
Well, they're having
this talent show.

154
00:09:25,599 --> 00:09:27,833
And I
thought I might...

155
00:09:27,836 --> 00:09:30,368
- Sign up?
- Well, maybe?

156
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:33,738
You have to have
talent to be in a talent show.

157
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,708
What are you gonna do?
Shine shoes?

158
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,176
It's <i>Dia de los Muertos.</i>

159
00:09:38,178 --> 00:09:41,613
No one's going anywhere.
Tonight is about family.

160
00:09:41,615 --> 00:09:44,432
<i>Ofrenda</i> room. <i>Vamonos.</i>

161
00:09:55,163 --> 00:09:57,029
Don't give me that look.

162
00:09:57,031 --> 00:09:59,865
<i>Dia de los Muertos</i>
is the one night of the year

163
00:09:59,868 --> 00:10:01,901
our ancestors
can come visit us.

164
00:10:01,903 --> 00:10:04,136
We've put their photos
on the <i>ofrenda</i>

165
00:10:04,138 --> 00:10:06,038
so their spirits
can cross over.

166
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,006
That is very important.

167
00:10:08,008 --> 00:10:10,909
If we don't put them up,
they can't come.

168
00:10:10,911 --> 00:10:12,645
We made all this food,

169
00:10:12,647 --> 00:10:15,280
set out the things
they loved in life, <i>mijo.</i>

170
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:18,650
All this work
to bring the family together.

171
00:10:18,652 --> 00:10:21,920
I don't want you sneaking
off to who knows where.

172
00:10:21,922 --> 00:10:23,355
Where are you going?

173
00:10:23,357 --> 00:10:24,890
I thought
we were done.

174
00:10:24,893 --> 00:10:28,026
<i>Ay, Dios mio.</i> Being part
of this family means

175
00:10:28,028 --> 00:10:29,895
being here for this family.

176
00:10:29,898 --> 00:10:32,164
I don't want
to see you end up like...

177
00:10:32,167 --> 00:10:33,332
Like <i>Mama</i> Coco's <i>papa?</i>

178
00:10:33,334 --> 00:10:36,801
Never mention that man!
He's better off forgotten.

179
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:37,902
But you're the one who...

180
00:10:37,905 --> 00:10:39,070
I was just...

181
00:10:39,072 --> 00:10:40,338
But... I...

182
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:43,708
<i>Papa? Papa</i> is home?

183
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:46,679
<i>Mama, calmese, calmese.</i>

184
00:10:46,681 --> 00:10:48,447
<i>Papa</i> is coming home?

185
00:10:48,449 --> 00:10:51,565
No, <i>Mama.</i>
It's okay. I'm here.

186
00:10:52,686 --> 00:10:54,318
Who are you?

187
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,924
Rest, <i>Mama.</i>

188
00:10:57,926 --> 00:11:01,093
I'm hard on you
because I care, Miguel.

189
00:11:01,095 --> 00:11:03,277
Miguel? Miguel?

190
00:11:06,234 --> 00:11:09,367
What are we going
to do with that boy?

191
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:13,421
You're right.
That's just what he needs.

192
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:39,097
It's you. Get in here.

193
00:11:39,099 --> 00:11:42,167
Come on, Dante. Hurry up!

194
00:11:42,169 --> 00:11:44,136
You're gonna
get me in trouble, boy.

195
00:11:44,138 --> 00:11:45,720
Someone could hear me.

196
00:11:50,445 --> 00:11:52,410
I wish someone
wanted to hear me.

197
00:11:53,748 --> 00:11:56,730
Other than you. Ew. Okay.

198
00:11:58,319 --> 00:12:00,468
<i>Perfecto!</i>

199
00:12:33,888 --> 00:12:36,454
<i>I have to sing.
I have to play!</i>

200
00:12:36,456 --> 00:12:41,207
<i>The music, it's not
just in me, it is me.</i>

201
00:12:42,997 --> 00:12:46,113
<i>When life gets me down,
I play my guitar.</i>

202
00:12:47,034 --> 00:12:49,234
<i>The rest of the world
may follow the rules,</i>

203
00:12:49,236 --> 00:12:52,119
<i>but I must follow my heart.</i>

204
00:12:52,506 --> 00:12:54,173
Ugh!

205
00:12:54,175 --> 00:12:56,974
<i>You know that feeling like
there's a song in the air and...</i>

206
00:12:56,976 --> 00:12:59,093
<i>it's playing just for you?</i>

207
00:13:02,216 --> 00:13:05,384
<i>♪ A feeling so close...</i>

208
00:13:05,386 --> 00:13:09,703
<i>♪ You could
reach out and touch it</i>

209
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:12,223
<i>♪ I never knew</i>

210
00:13:12,226 --> 00:13:16,377
<i>♪ I could want something
so much, but it's true ♪</i>

211
00:13:17,331 --> 00:13:18,930
<i>You must have faith, sister.</i>

212
00:13:18,932 --> 00:13:21,366
<i>Oh, but,</i> Padre,
<i>he will never listen.</i>

213
00:13:21,368 --> 00:13:23,401
<i>He will listen. To music.</i>

214
00:13:23,403 --> 00:13:27,005
<i>♪ Only a song,
only a song</i>

215
00:13:27,007 --> 00:13:29,690
<i>♪ Has the power
to change a heart ♪</i>

216
00:13:33,947 --> 00:13:36,831
<i>Never underestimate
the power of music.</i>

217
00:13:41,221 --> 00:13:44,556
<i>But my father, he will
never give his permission.</i>

218
00:13:44,558 --> 00:13:46,191
<i>I am done
asking permission.</i>

219
00:13:46,193 --> 00:13:49,362
<i>When you see your moment, you
mustn't let it pass you by.</i>

220
00:13:49,364 --> 00:13:51,262
<i>You must seize it!</i>

221
00:13:51,265 --> 00:13:52,497
Senor <i>de la Cruz,</i>

222
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:55,548
<i>what did it take for you
to seize your moment?</i>

223
00:13:57,105 --> 00:14:00,006
<i>I had to have
faith in my dream.</i>

224
00:14:00,008 --> 00:14:01,973
<i>No one was going
to hand it to me.</i>

225
00:14:01,975 --> 00:14:04,276
<i>It was up to me
to reach for that dream.</i>

226
00:14:04,278 --> 00:14:06,245
<i>Grab it tight
and make it come true.</i>

227
00:14:06,247 --> 00:14:07,862
<i>...and make it come true.</i>

228
00:14:12,387 --> 00:14:16,021
No more hiding, Dante.
I got to seize my moment!

229
00:14:17,192 --> 00:14:20,192
I'm gonna play in Mariachi
Plaza if it kills me.

230
00:14:23,565 --> 00:14:27,266
<i>Dia de los Muertos</i> has begun!

231
00:14:27,268 --> 00:14:30,535
No, no. We have to make
a clear path.

232
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:33,170
The petals guide
our ancestors home.

233
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:35,207
We don't want
their spirits to get lost.

234
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:37,910
We want them to come
and enjoy all the food

235
00:14:37,912 --> 00:14:39,527
and drinks on the <i>ofrenda.</i>

236
00:14:40,614 --> 00:14:41,979
<i>Mama!</i>

237
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:43,347
Where should we
put this table?

238
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:45,050
In the courtyard, <i>mijos.</i>

239
00:14:45,052 --> 00:14:46,218
You want it
down by the kitchen?

240
00:14:46,221 --> 00:14:48,620
<i>Si.</i> Next to the other one.

241
00:14:51,191 --> 00:14:54,160
- Get under! Get under!
- Miguel?

242
00:14:54,162 --> 00:14:57,597
Nothing! <i>Mama, Papa.</i> I...

243
00:14:57,599 --> 00:15:02,467
Miguel, your <i>abuelita</i> had
the most wonderful idea.

244
00:15:02,469 --> 00:15:06,705
We've all decided. It's time
you joined us in the workshop!

245
00:15:06,707 --> 00:15:09,175
- What?
- No more shining shoes.

246
00:15:09,177 --> 00:15:12,110
You'll be making them
every day after school.

247
00:15:12,112 --> 00:15:15,180
Oh! Our Migueli-ti-ti-ti-to

248
00:15:15,182 --> 00:15:17,649
carrying on
the family tradition.

249
00:15:17,651 --> 00:15:20,318
And on <i>Dia de los Muertos!</i>

250
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,121
Your ancestors
will be so proud.

251
00:15:23,123 --> 00:15:26,525
You'll craft huaraches
just like your <i>Tia</i> Victoria.

252
00:15:26,528 --> 00:15:29,194
And wingtips
like your <i>Papa</i> Julio.

253
00:15:29,196 --> 00:15:31,730
But what if
I'm no good at making shoes?

254
00:15:31,732 --> 00:15:36,102
Ah, Miguel. You have your
family here to guide you.

255
00:15:36,104 --> 00:15:40,689
You are a Rivera.
And a Rivera is...

256
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:44,242
A shoemaker.
Through and through.

257
00:15:44,244 --> 00:15:47,280
That's my boy!
Berto!

258
00:15:47,282 --> 00:15:50,247
Break out the good stuff.
I want to make a toast.

259
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,877
Dante! No, Dante. Stop!

260
00:16:14,142 --> 00:16:17,459
No, no, no, no, no! No.

261
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:31,589
De la Cruz's guitar?

262
00:16:31,592 --> 00:16:35,041
<i>Papa? Papa?</i>

263
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:40,166
<i>Mama</i> Coco, is your <i>papa</i>
Ernesto de la Cruz?

264
00:16:40,168 --> 00:16:42,801
<i>Papa! Papa!</i>

265
00:16:54,415 --> 00:16:56,549
<i>Papa! Papa!</i> It's him!

266
00:16:56,551 --> 00:16:58,416
I know who my
great-great-grandfather was.

267
00:16:58,418 --> 00:17:00,453
Miguel, get down
from there.

268
00:17:00,455 --> 00:17:03,221
<i>Mama</i> Coco's father
was Ernesto de la Cruz!

269
00:17:03,223 --> 00:17:04,522
What are you talking about?

270
00:17:04,525 --> 00:17:06,606
I'm gonna be a musician!

271
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:09,629
What is all this?

272
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:11,730
You keep secrets
from your own family?

273
00:17:11,732 --> 00:17:14,065
It's all that time
he spends in the plaza.

274
00:17:14,067 --> 00:17:15,468
Fills his head
with crazy fantasies.

275
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:17,069
It's not a fantasy.

276
00:17:17,071 --> 00:17:19,336
That man was
Ernesto de la Cruz!

277
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:21,207
The greatest musician
of all time!

278
00:17:21,209 --> 00:17:22,741
We've never known anything
about this man!

279
00:17:22,743 --> 00:17:26,478
But whoever he was, he still
abandoned his family.

280
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,113
This is no future
for my son.

281
00:17:28,115 --> 00:17:30,650
But, <i>Papa,</i> you said
my family would guide me.

282
00:17:30,652 --> 00:17:33,219
Well, de la Cruz
is my family.

283
00:17:33,221 --> 00:17:34,754
I'm supposed to play music.

284
00:17:34,756 --> 00:17:37,089
Never! That man's music
was a curse.

285
00:17:37,091 --> 00:17:39,091
I will not allow it.

286
00:17:39,093 --> 00:17:40,624
- If you would just let...
- Miguel...

287
00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:42,228
You will listen
to your family.

288
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:43,527
No more music.

289
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:46,679
- Just listen to me play!
- End of argument.

290
00:17:48,502 --> 00:17:51,169
You want to end up
like that man? Forgotten?

291
00:17:51,171 --> 00:17:53,573
Left off
your family's <i>ofrenda?</i>

292
00:17:53,575 --> 00:17:55,707
I don't care if I'm on
some stupid <i>ofrenda.</i>

293
00:17:59,546 --> 00:18:00,711
- No!
- <i>Mama!</i>

294
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:09,254
There. No guitar.
No music.

295
00:18:11,526 --> 00:18:16,460
Oh, come. You'll feel better
after you eat with your family.

296
00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:18,579
I don't want
to be in this family!

297
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,047
Miguel! Miguel!

298
00:18:39,486 --> 00:18:42,354
I want to play in the plaza,
like de la Cruz.

299
00:18:42,356 --> 00:18:43,555
Can I still sign up?

300
00:18:43,557 --> 00:18:45,223
You got an instrument?

301
00:18:45,225 --> 00:18:47,559
No. But if I
can borrow a guitar...

302
00:18:47,561 --> 00:18:49,427
Musicians got to bring
their own instruments.

303
00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:50,896
You find a guitar, kid,

304
00:18:50,899 --> 00:18:52,613
I'll put you on the list.

305
00:18:54,836 --> 00:18:58,303
- Can I borrow your guitar?
- Sorry, <i>muchacho.</i>

306
00:18:58,305 --> 00:19:01,305
- You guys have a spare guitar?
- No.

307
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:03,440
I need a guitar
just for a little bit.

308
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:06,025
Get out of here, kid.

309
00:19:17,858 --> 00:19:22,208
Great-great-grandfather,
what am I supposed to do?

310
00:19:59,901 --> 00:20:01,399
No, no, no, no.

311
00:20:01,401 --> 00:20:04,269
Dante, stop! <i>Callate!</i> Shh!

312
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:27,241
I'm sorry.

313
00:21:03,498 --> 00:21:07,332
<i>Senor</i> de la Cruz,
please don't be mad.

314
00:21:07,334 --> 00:21:08,699
I'm Miguel.

315
00:21:08,701 --> 00:21:13,286
Your great-great grandson.
I need to borrow this.

316
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:18,843
Our family thinks
music is a curse.

317
00:21:18,845 --> 00:21:22,746
None of them understand
but I know you would have.

318
00:21:22,748 --> 00:21:25,517
You would have told me
to follow my heart.

319
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:27,033
To seize my moment!

320
00:21:28,323 --> 00:21:31,324
So, if it's
all right with you,

321
00:21:31,326 --> 00:21:34,041
I'm gonna play in the plaza.
Just like you did!

322
00:21:41,768 --> 00:21:44,736
The guitar! It's gone!

323
00:21:44,738 --> 00:21:47,037
Somebody stole
de la Cruz's guitar!

324
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,342
The window's broken.
Look!

325
00:21:53,747 --> 00:21:55,513
All right, who's in there?

326
00:21:55,515 --> 00:21:57,350
I'm sorry.
It's not what it looks like.

327
00:21:57,352 --> 00:21:58,866
De la Cruz is my...

328
00:21:59,952 --> 00:22:02,235
There's nobody here.

329
00:22:17,671 --> 00:22:19,036
- Miguel!
<i>- Mama!</i>

330
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:23,675
Miguel, come home.
Where are you, Miguel?

331
00:22:26,913 --> 00:22:30,515
<i>Dios mio!</i>
Little boy. Are you okay?

332
00:22:30,517 --> 00:22:32,232
Here. Let me help you.

333
00:22:33,121 --> 00:22:34,901
Thanks. I...

334
00:22:45,097 --> 00:22:47,413
Do you mind? Whoa!

335
00:23:07,954 --> 00:23:10,689
Look how big she's getting.

336
00:23:13,826 --> 00:23:15,727
Dante!

337
00:23:15,729 --> 00:23:18,729
You can see me? Wait!

338
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:21,782
What's going on? Dante!

339
00:23:23,671 --> 00:23:25,969
- Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Miguel?

340
00:23:25,972 --> 00:23:27,755
- Miguel?
- Miguel?

341
00:23:31,143 --> 00:23:34,845
You're here? Here, here.
And you can see us?

342
00:23:34,847 --> 00:23:37,481
Our Migueli-ti-ti-ti-to!

343
00:23:37,483 --> 00:23:38,984
Remind me how I know you.

344
00:23:38,986 --> 00:23:41,968
We're your family, <i>mijo.</i>

345
00:23:42,923 --> 00:23:45,773
<i>- Tia</i> Rosita?
<i>- Si.</i>

346
00:23:47,661 --> 00:23:49,943
<i>- Papa</i> Julio?
<i>- Hola.</i>

347
00:23:50,697 --> 00:23:52,130
<i>Tia</i> Victoria?

348
00:23:52,132 --> 00:23:54,631
He doesn't
seem entirely dead.

349
00:23:54,634 --> 00:23:57,535
He's not quite alive either.

350
00:23:57,538 --> 00:24:00,138
We need <i>Mama</i> Imelda.
She'll know how to fix this.

351
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:04,141
<i>Oye!</i> It's <i>Mama</i> Imelda.

352
00:24:04,143 --> 00:24:05,543
She couldn't cross over.

353
00:24:05,546 --> 00:24:07,978
- She's stuck!
- On the other side!

354
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:10,782
<i>Tio</i> Oscar? <i>Tio</i> Felipe?

355
00:24:10,784 --> 00:24:12,883
Oh. Hey, Miguel.

356
00:24:12,885 --> 00:24:15,519
I have a feeling this has
something to do with you.

357
00:24:15,521 --> 00:24:17,655
But if <i>Mama</i> Imelda
can't come to us...

358
00:24:17,657 --> 00:24:19,923
Then we are going to her.
<i>Vamonos!</i>

359
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:35,206
Whoa.

360
00:24:35,209 --> 00:24:37,957
Come on, Miguel.
It's okay.

361
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:55,141
Dante? Dante!
Dante, wait up!

362
00:24:57,564 --> 00:25:02,415
You got to stay with me, boy.
We don't know... where...

363
00:25:22,823 --> 00:25:26,256
This isn't a dream then.
You're all really out there.

364
00:25:26,259 --> 00:25:28,226
- You thought we weren't?
- Well, I don't know.

365
00:25:28,228 --> 00:25:30,094
I thought it might've been
one of those

366
00:25:30,096 --> 00:25:32,029
made up things
that adults tell kids.

367
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:33,598
Like vitamins.

368
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,734
Miguel,
vitamins are a real thing.

369
00:25:35,736 --> 00:25:37,901
Well, now I'm thinking
maybe they could be.

370
00:25:37,904 --> 00:25:39,970
<i>Mija,</i> it's not nice to stare at...

371
00:25:39,972 --> 00:25:41,640
<i>Ay!</i> Santa Maria!

372
00:25:49,316 --> 00:25:53,718
Are those...
Alebrijes! But those are...

373
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:56,254
Real alebrijes.
Spirit creatures.

374
00:25:56,256 --> 00:25:58,122
They guide souls
on their journey.

375
00:25:58,124 --> 00:26:00,592
Watch your step. They
make <i>caquitas</i> everywhere.

376
00:26:00,594 --> 00:26:02,794
<i>Welcome back
to the Land of the Dead.</i>

377
00:26:02,796 --> 00:26:05,630
<i>Please have all offerings
ready for re-entry.</i>

378
00:26:05,632 --> 00:26:07,865
Welcome back.
Anything to declare?

379
00:26:07,867 --> 00:26:09,333
Some churros.
From my family.

380
00:26:09,335 --> 00:26:11,335
How wonderful. Next.

381
00:26:11,337 --> 00:26:13,204
<i>If you are
experiencing travel issues,</i>

382
00:26:13,207 --> 00:26:14,940
<i>agents at
the Department of Family...</i>

383
00:26:14,942 --> 00:26:17,175
<i>Reunions are
available to assist you.</i>

384
00:26:17,177 --> 00:26:18,959
Next family, please.

385
00:26:22,449 --> 00:26:25,016
Oh! Your photos
are on your son's <i>ofrenda.</i>

386
00:26:25,018 --> 00:26:26,383
Have a great visit.

387
00:26:26,385 --> 00:26:27,651
<i>Gracias.</i>

388
00:26:27,653 --> 00:26:29,688
<i>And remember
to return before sunrise.</i>

389
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:30,889
<i>Enjoy your visit.</i>

390
00:26:30,891 --> 00:26:33,224
Next.

391
00:26:33,227 --> 00:26:36,760
Your photo's on your dentist's <i>ofrenda.</i>
Enjoy your visit.

392
00:26:36,762 --> 00:26:38,544
- <i>Gracias.</i>
- Next?

393
00:26:40,834 --> 00:26:43,067
Yes! It is I.
Frida Kahlo.

394
00:26:43,069 --> 00:26:44,635
Shall we skip
the scanner?

395
00:26:44,637 --> 00:26:48,354
I'm on so many <i>ofrendas</i> it'll just
overwhelm your blinky thingy.

396
00:26:50,076 --> 00:26:54,646
Well, shoot, looks like no one
put up your photo, Frida.

397
00:26:54,648 --> 00:26:58,917
Okay, when I said I was Frida,
just now, that was a lie.

398
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:00,317
And I apologize
for doing that.

399
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:03,188
No photo on an <i>ofrenda,</i>
no crossing the bridge.

400
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:06,973
I'm just gonna zip right over.
You won't even know I'm gone.

401
00:27:07,928 --> 00:27:10,109
Hey!

402
00:27:15,669 --> 00:27:19,403
Almost... there.
Just a little further.

403
00:27:24,211 --> 00:27:25,275
Upsy-daisy...

404
00:27:25,278 --> 00:27:29,680
Fine. Okay. Fine, who cares?
Dumb flower bridge!

405
00:27:29,682 --> 00:27:33,785
Aw. I don't know what I'd do
if no one put up my photo.

406
00:27:33,787 --> 00:27:36,086
- Next?
- Oh! Come, <i>mijo.</i> It's our turn.

407
00:27:36,088 --> 00:27:39,024
Welcome back, <i>amigos.</i>
Anything to declare?

408
00:27:39,026 --> 00:27:42,443
As a matter of fact, yes.

409
00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:44,143
<i>Hola.</i>

410
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:53,138
<i>Paging Marta Gonzales-Ramos.</i>

411
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:56,022
<i>Please report to Level Seven.</i>

412
00:28:00,314 --> 00:28:02,061
Whoa!

413
00:28:05,251 --> 00:28:07,300
I miss my nose.

414
00:28:16,329 --> 00:28:18,295
Come on, help us out, <i>amigo.</i>

415
00:28:18,297 --> 00:28:19,764
We got to get to
a dozen <i>ofrendas</i> tonight.

416
00:28:19,766 --> 00:28:23,901
We are not visiting your ex-wife's
family for <i>Dia de Muertos!</i>

417
00:28:23,903 --> 00:28:26,438
I demand to speak
to the person in charge!

418
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:29,341
I'm sorry, <i>senora,</i> it says
here no one put up your photo.

419
00:28:29,343 --> 00:28:33,911
My family always puts my
photo on the <i>ofrenda.</i>

420
00:28:33,913 --> 00:28:37,014
That devil box tells
you nothing but lies!

421
00:28:37,016 --> 00:28:41,785
- <i>Mama</i> Imelda?
- Oh, <i>mi familia!</i>

422
00:28:41,787 --> 00:28:43,387
They wouldn't let me
cross the bridge.

423
00:28:43,389 --> 00:28:45,890
Tell this woman
and her devil box

424
00:28:45,893 --> 00:28:48,426
that my photo
is on the <i>ofrenda.</i>

425
00:28:48,428 --> 00:28:51,896
Well, we never
made it to the <i>ofrenda.</i>

426
00:28:51,899 --> 00:28:55,615
- What?
- We ran into...

427
00:28:58,304 --> 00:29:01,422
- Miguel?
<i>- Mama</i> Imelda.

428
00:29:01,842 --> 00:29:04,175
What is going on?

429
00:29:04,177 --> 00:29:06,478
You the Rivera family?

430
00:29:08,081 --> 00:29:09,447
Well, you're cursed.

431
00:29:09,449 --> 00:29:10,582
What?

432
00:29:10,584 --> 00:29:13,218
<i>Dia de los Muertos</i> is the
night to give to the dead.

433
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,819
You stole from the dead!

434
00:29:14,821 --> 00:29:16,187
But I wasn't
stealing the guitar.

435
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:17,321
Guitar?

436
00:29:17,323 --> 00:29:18,922
It was my
great-great-grandfather's.

437
00:29:18,925 --> 00:29:20,225
He would have
wanted me to have it.

438
00:29:20,227 --> 00:29:23,361
Ah, ah, ah. We do not speak
of that musician.

439
00:29:23,363 --> 00:29:25,095
He is dead to this family.

440
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:27,064
Uh,
you're all dead.

441
00:29:28,134 --> 00:29:30,802
I am sorry.
Whose alebrije is that?

442
00:29:30,804 --> 00:29:32,069
That's just Dante.

443
00:29:32,071 --> 00:29:34,205
He sure doesn't
look like an alebrije.

444
00:29:34,208 --> 00:29:35,806
He just looks
like a plain old dog.

445
00:29:35,808 --> 00:29:38,074
Or a sausage someone dropped
in a barbershop.

446
00:29:38,076 --> 00:29:41,845
Whatever he is, I am
terribly allergic.

447
00:29:41,847 --> 00:29:43,515
But Dante
doesn't have any hair.

448
00:29:43,517 --> 00:29:46,217
And I don't have a nose,
and yet, here we are.

449
00:29:47,421 --> 00:29:51,121
But none of this explains
why I couldn't cross over.

450
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:52,805
Oh!

451
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:56,994
You took my photo
off the <i>ofrenda?</i>

452
00:29:56,996 --> 00:29:59,095
- It was an accident!
- How do we send him back?

453
00:29:59,097 --> 00:30:01,833
Well,
since it's a family matter...

454
00:30:01,835 --> 00:30:04,268
the way to undo
a family curse

455
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:07,004
- is to get your family's blessing.
- That's it?

456
00:30:07,006 --> 00:30:08,406
Get your family's blessing

457
00:30:08,408 --> 00:30:11,007
and everything should
go back to normal.

458
00:30:11,009 --> 00:30:13,044
But you got
to do it by sunrise.

459
00:30:13,046 --> 00:30:14,978
What happens at sunrise?

460
00:30:14,981 --> 00:30:16,830
<i>Hijole!</i> Your hand!

461
00:30:21,989 --> 00:30:24,855
Whoa, Miguel, can't have
you fainting on us.

462
00:30:24,857 --> 00:30:27,425
But not to worry.
Your family's here.

463
00:30:27,427 --> 00:30:29,460
You can get
your blessing right now.

464
00:30:29,462 --> 00:30:34,431
<i>Cempasuchil, cempasuchil.</i>
Aha! <i>Perdon, senora.</i>

465
00:30:34,433 --> 00:30:35,400
Oh.

466
00:30:35,402 --> 00:30:38,319
Now, you look at the living
and say his name.

467
00:30:39,205 --> 00:30:40,237
Miguel.

468
00:30:40,239 --> 00:30:43,541
Nailed it. Now say,
"I give you my blessing."

469
00:30:43,544 --> 00:30:45,592
I give you my blessing.

470
00:30:48,015 --> 00:30:51,414
I give you my blessing
to go home...

471
00:30:51,416 --> 00:30:54,585
to put my photo
back on the <i>ofrenda,</i>

472
00:30:54,587 --> 00:30:57,022
and to never
play music again.

473
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:58,890
What? She can't do that!

474
00:30:58,892 --> 00:31:02,159
Well, technically, she can
add any condition she wants.

475
00:31:02,161 --> 00:31:04,294
Fine.

476
00:31:04,297 --> 00:31:06,513
Then you hand
the petal to Miguel.

477
00:31:19,046 --> 00:31:20,393
No skeletons!

478
00:31:24,483 --> 00:31:26,765
Mariachi Plaza,
here I come.

479
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:33,189
Two seconds and you already
break your promise.

480
00:31:33,191 --> 00:31:37,062
This isn't fair. It's my life.
You already had yours.

481
00:31:37,064 --> 00:31:39,130
<i>Papa</i> Julio,
I ask for your blessing.

482
00:31:39,132 --> 00:31:42,233
<i>Tia</i> Rosita? Oscar?

483
00:31:42,236 --> 00:31:45,102
Felipe? <i>Tia</i> Victoria?

484
00:31:45,104 --> 00:31:49,506
Don't make this hard, <i>mijo.</i>
You go home my way or no way.

485
00:31:49,508 --> 00:31:51,374
You really hate
music that much?

486
00:31:51,376 --> 00:31:54,526
I will not let you go down
the same path he did.

487
00:31:56,950 --> 00:32:01,151
The same path he did.
He's family.

488
00:32:01,153 --> 00:32:02,954
Listen to your <i>Mama</i> Imelda.

489
00:32:02,956 --> 00:32:04,220
She's just
looking out for you.

490
00:32:04,222 --> 00:32:05,289
Be reasonable.

491
00:32:05,291 --> 00:32:08,625
<i>Con permiso,</i>
I need to visit the restroom.

492
00:32:08,628 --> 00:32:10,410
Be right back.

493
00:32:11,265 --> 00:32:13,364
Uh, should we tell him
there are no restrooms

494
00:32:13,366 --> 00:32:14,680
in the Land of the Dead?

495
00:32:27,713 --> 00:32:28,880
<i>Vamonos.</i>

496
00:32:28,882 --> 00:32:31,583
We got a family
looking for a living boy.

497
00:32:31,585 --> 00:32:34,318
If I want to be a musician,
I need a musician's blessing.

498
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,388
We got to find
my great-great-grandpa.

499
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:38,439
Hold it, <i>muchacho.</i>

500
00:32:42,028 --> 00:32:43,394
I found that living boy!

501
00:32:43,396 --> 00:32:45,629
Oh, whoa, excuse me.
Excuse me, folks.

502
00:32:45,631 --> 00:32:46,981
Excuse me.

503
00:32:47,733 --> 00:32:49,248
Oh.

504
00:32:53,006 --> 00:32:55,272
No, no. Dante!

505
00:32:55,274 --> 00:32:58,308
Disturbing the peace.
Fleeing an officer.

506
00:32:58,311 --> 00:33:00,177
Falsifying a unibrow.

507
00:33:00,179 --> 00:33:02,446
- That's illegal?
- Very illegal.

508
00:33:02,448 --> 00:33:04,547
You need to clean up
your act, <i>amigo.</i>

509
00:33:04,549 --> 00:33:08,285
<i>Amigo?</i> Oh, that's so nice
to hear you say that

510
00:33:08,287 --> 00:33:10,086
because I have just had a...

511
00:33:10,088 --> 00:33:13,024
really hard <i>Dia de Muertos</i>
and I could really use

512
00:33:13,026 --> 00:33:14,025
an <i>amigo</i> right now.

513
00:33:14,027 --> 00:33:16,760
And <i>amigos,</i>
they help their <i>amigos.</i>

514
00:33:16,762 --> 00:33:19,462
You get me across
that bridge tonight,

515
00:33:19,464 --> 00:33:21,065
and I'll make it
worth your while.

516
00:33:21,067 --> 00:33:24,169
Oh! You like de la Cruz?
He and I go way back.

517
00:33:24,171 --> 00:33:27,505
I can get you front row seats to
his Sunrise Spectacular show.

518
00:33:27,507 --> 00:33:29,708
I'll get you backstage.
You can meet him.

519
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:31,442
You just got to let me
cross that bridge!

520
00:33:31,444 --> 00:33:33,612
I should lock you up
for the rest of the holiday.

521
00:33:33,614 --> 00:33:37,716
But my shift's almost up and I
want to visit my living family.

522
00:33:37,718 --> 00:33:40,433
So I'm letting you off
with a warning.

523
00:33:41,386 --> 00:33:43,521
Can I at least
get my costume back?

524
00:33:43,524 --> 00:33:45,322
Uh... No.

525
00:33:45,324 --> 00:33:47,807
Some <i>amigo.</i>

526
00:33:50,263 --> 00:33:53,731
Hey! Hey!
You really know de la Cruz?

527
00:33:53,733 --> 00:33:56,367
Who wants to... Ahh!
<i>Ay!</i> You're alive!

528
00:33:56,369 --> 00:33:58,069
Shh! Yeah, I'm alive.

529
00:33:58,071 --> 00:34:00,137
And if I want to get back
to the Land of the Living...

530
00:34:00,139 --> 00:34:01,604
I need de la Cruz's blessing.

531
00:34:01,606 --> 00:34:03,208
That's weirdly specific.

532
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:04,742
He's my
great-great-grandfather.

533
00:34:04,744 --> 00:34:07,326
He's your Gr... What?

534
00:34:07,748 --> 00:34:09,679
Ugh.

535
00:34:09,681 --> 00:34:13,534
Wait, wait, wait.
Wait, wait.

536
00:34:14,387 --> 00:34:16,487
Wait. No, wait, wait, wait.

537
00:34:16,489 --> 00:34:20,623
Wait! Yes! You're going back
to the Land of the Living!

538
00:34:20,625 --> 00:34:22,625
You know what? Maybe this
isn't such a good...

539
00:34:22,627 --> 00:34:25,361
No, no, <i>nino! Nino, nino,</i> I can help you.
You can help me.

540
00:34:25,363 --> 00:34:26,497
We can help each other.

541
00:34:26,499 --> 00:34:28,364
But most importantly,
you can help me.

542
00:34:28,366 --> 00:34:29,867
- Miguel!
- I'm Hector.

543
00:34:29,869 --> 00:34:31,417
That's nice.

544
00:34:36,109 --> 00:34:37,757
<i>Esperame, chamaco!</i>

545
00:34:45,585 --> 00:34:48,153
<i>Ay,</i> he is going
to get himself killed.

546
00:34:48,155 --> 00:34:51,771
I need my spirit guide...
Pepita.

547
00:35:03,468 --> 00:35:05,537
Who has that petal
Miguel touched?

548
00:35:05,539 --> 00:35:08,654
Here. Nice alebrije.

549
00:35:21,687 --> 00:35:26,004
<i>Ay, ay,</i> hold still. Look up. <i>A ver, a ver.</i>
Look up, up, up.

550
00:35:27,293 --> 00:35:32,428
<i>Aqui arriba, eso...</i>
Eh, <i>la rayita.</i>

551
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:35,013
Okay. Hey! Ta-da!

552
00:35:35,701 --> 00:35:37,550
Dead as a doorknob.

553
00:35:38,504 --> 00:35:41,605
So listen, Miguel,
this place runs on memories.

554
00:35:41,607 --> 00:35:42,840
When you're well remembered,

555
00:35:42,842 --> 00:35:44,707
people put up your photo
and you get to...

556
00:35:44,709 --> 00:35:46,310
cross the bridge
and visit the living

557
00:35:46,312 --> 00:35:48,779
on <i>Dia de Muertos.</i>
Unless you're me.

558
00:35:48,781 --> 00:35:50,581
You don't get
to cross over?

559
00:35:50,583 --> 00:35:51,849
No one's ever
put up my picture.

560
00:35:51,851 --> 00:35:53,632
But you can change that!

561
00:35:53,853 --> 00:35:55,618
This is you?

562
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,254
Eh, <i>muy guapo,</i> eh?

563
00:35:57,256 --> 00:36:00,357
So, you get me
to my great-great-grandpa...

564
00:36:00,359 --> 00:36:03,259
then I put up your photo
when I get home?

565
00:36:03,261 --> 00:36:06,931
Such a smart boy! Yes!
Great idea, yes! One hiccup.

566
00:36:06,934 --> 00:36:08,867
De la Cruz is
a tough guy to get to

567
00:36:08,869 --> 00:36:10,668
and I need to
cross the bridge soon.

568
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:11,670
Like, tonight.

569
00:36:11,672 --> 00:36:13,636
So, you got any other
family here, you know?

570
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:15,773
Someone a bit more,
eh, accessible?

571
00:36:15,775 --> 00:36:17,608
Mmm... Nope.

572
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:18,942
Don't yank my chain,
<i>chamaco.</i>

573
00:36:18,945 --> 00:36:20,544
You got to have
some other family.

574
00:36:20,546 --> 00:36:21,880
Only de la Cruz.

575
00:36:21,882 --> 00:36:23,913
If you can't help me,
I'll find him myself.

576
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:27,786
Oh! Okay. Okay, kid.
Fine! Fine!

577
00:36:27,788 --> 00:36:29,668
I'll get you to your
great-great-grandpa.

578
00:36:31,357 --> 00:36:32,823
It's not gonna
be easy, you know?

579
00:36:32,825 --> 00:36:35,961
He's a busy man.
What are you doing?

580
00:36:35,963 --> 00:36:38,629
I'm walking like a skeleton.
Blending in.

581
00:36:38,631 --> 00:36:40,432
No. Skeletons
don't walk like that.

582
00:36:40,434 --> 00:36:44,500
- It's how you walk.
- No, I don't! Stop it!

583
00:36:44,502 --> 00:36:48,440
Whoa! Ernesto de la Cruz's
Sunrise Spectacular?

584
00:36:48,442 --> 00:36:50,241
<i>Que padre!</i>

585
00:36:50,244 --> 00:36:53,377
Every year your great-great-grandpa
puts on that dumb show...

586
00:36:53,379 --> 00:36:54,813
to mark the end
of <i>Dia de Muertos.</i>

587
00:36:54,815 --> 00:36:57,381
- And you can get us in!
- Um...

588
00:36:57,383 --> 00:36:59,650
Hey, you said you have
front row tickets!

589
00:36:59,652 --> 00:37:02,853
That... was a lie.
I apologize for that.

590
00:37:02,855 --> 00:37:05,022
Cool off, <i>chamaco.</i>
Come on. I'll get you to him.

591
00:37:05,024 --> 00:37:06,123
How?

592
00:37:06,125 --> 00:37:08,241
Because I happen to know
where he's rehearsing.

593
00:37:18,803 --> 00:37:22,988
<i>♪ Remember me
Don't let it make you cry ♪</i>

594
00:37:24,277 --> 00:37:26,542
You better have
my dress, Hector.

595
00:37:26,544 --> 00:37:27,926
<i>Hola,</i> Ceci.

596
00:37:33,753 --> 00:37:38,023
- <i>Hola.</i>
- Ceci, I lost the dress.

597
00:37:38,025 --> 00:37:39,690
<i>Ya lo sabia!</i>

598
00:37:39,692 --> 00:37:41,959
I got to dress
forty dancers by sunrise.

599
00:37:41,961 --> 00:37:45,828
Thanks to you, I'm one Frida
short of an opening number!

600
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:49,916
Dante!
We shouldn't be in here.

601
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:07,166
No, no, Dante! <i>Ven aca!</i>

602
00:38:15,995 --> 00:38:17,861
You! How did you
get in here?

603
00:38:17,863 --> 00:38:22,031
- I just followed my...
- Oh! The mighty Xolo dog!

604
00:38:22,033 --> 00:38:25,002
Guider of wandering spirits.

605
00:38:25,004 --> 00:38:28,038
And whose spirit
have you guided to me?

606
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:30,406
I don't think
he's a spirit guide.

607
00:38:30,408 --> 00:38:31,408
Ah, ah, ah.

608
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:34,478
The alebrijes of this world
can take many forms.

609
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,797
They are as mysterious
as they are powerful.

610
00:38:43,388 --> 00:38:47,239
Or maybe he's just a dog.
Come, I need your eyes.

611
00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:52,663
You are the audience.
Darkness.

612
00:38:52,665 --> 00:38:56,883
And from the darkness,
a giant papaya.

613
00:38:57,838 --> 00:39:00,838
Dancers emerge
from the papaya,

614
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:04,908
and the dancers are all me.

615
00:39:04,911 --> 00:39:07,643
And they go to drink from
the milk of their mother,

616
00:39:07,646 --> 00:39:08,847
who is a cactus.

617
00:39:08,849 --> 00:39:10,581
But who is also me.

618
00:39:10,583 --> 00:39:14,900
And her milk is
not milk but tears.

619
00:39:15,856 --> 00:39:16,920
Is it too obvious?

620
00:39:16,923 --> 00:39:20,656
I think it's just
the right amount of obvious?

621
00:39:20,659 --> 00:39:24,060
It could use some music.
Oh, what if you did like...

622
00:39:27,466 --> 00:39:28,931
Oh! And then it could go...

623
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:37,409
And what if
everything was on fire?

624
00:39:37,411 --> 00:39:39,610
Yes! Fire! Everywhere!

625
00:39:39,612 --> 00:39:43,814
Inspired! You have
the spirit of an artist.

626
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:48,686
The dancers exit. The music
fades, the lights go out.

627
00:39:48,688 --> 00:39:52,022
And Ernesto de la Cruz
rises to the stage!

628
00:39:55,828 --> 00:39:57,127
Huh?

629
00:39:57,129 --> 00:39:59,462
He does a couple of songs, the
sun rises, everyone cheers...

630
00:39:59,464 --> 00:40:01,998
Excuse me,
where's the real de la Cruz?

631
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,100
Ernesto doesn't do
rehearsals!

632
00:40:04,102 --> 00:40:08,019
He's too busy hosting that fancy
party at the top of his tower.

633
00:40:11,344 --> 00:40:13,644
<i>Chamaco,</i> you can't run off
on me like that.

634
00:40:13,646 --> 00:40:15,478
Stop pestering
the celebrities.

635
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,648
You said my great-great-grandpa
would be here!

636
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:20,516
He's halfway across town
throwing some big party.

637
00:40:20,518 --> 00:40:22,921
That bum. Who doesn't show up
to his own rehearsal?

638
00:40:22,923 --> 00:40:25,855
If you're such good friends,
how come he didn't invite you?

639
00:40:25,857 --> 00:40:28,726
He's your great-great-grandpa,
how come he didn't invite you?

640
00:40:28,728 --> 00:40:31,729
Hey, Gustavo! You know
anything about this party?

641
00:40:31,731 --> 00:40:33,163
It's the hot ticket!

642
00:40:33,165 --> 00:40:34,765
But if you're not
on the guest list,

643
00:40:34,767 --> 00:40:37,202
you're never
getting in, <i>Chorizo.</i>

644
00:40:37,204 --> 00:40:40,002
Hey! It's <i>Chorizo! Choricito!</i>

645
00:40:40,005 --> 00:40:41,638
A-ha. Very funny, guys.
Very funny.

646
00:40:41,641 --> 00:40:42,873
<i>Chorizo?</i>

647
00:40:42,875 --> 00:40:45,007
Oh, this guy's famous!

648
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:47,143
Go on, go on.
Ask him how he died.

649
00:40:47,145 --> 00:40:48,779
I don't want
to talk about it.

650
00:40:48,781 --> 00:40:51,915
He choked on some <i>chorizo!</i>

651
00:40:54,019 --> 00:40:55,753
I didn't choke, okay?

652
00:40:55,755 --> 00:40:57,755
I got food poisoning
which is a big difference.

653
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:00,524
This is why
I don't like musicians.

654
00:41:00,526 --> 00:41:02,158
Bunch of
self-important jerks.

655
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,662
- Hey! I'm a musician!
- You are?

656
00:41:04,664 --> 00:41:07,499
If you really want
to get to Ernesto,

657
00:41:07,501 --> 00:41:08,899
there is that
music competition...

658
00:41:08,901 --> 00:41:10,567
at the Plaza de la Cruz.

659
00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:13,119
Winner gets
to play at his party.

660
00:41:14,073 --> 00:41:17,074
No, no. <i>Chamaco,</i>
you're <i>loco</i> if you think...

661
00:41:17,076 --> 00:41:19,510
I need to get my
great-great-grandfather's blessing!

662
00:41:19,512 --> 00:41:21,393
You know where
I can get a guitar?

663
00:41:21,981 --> 00:41:25,263
I know a guy.

664
00:41:36,795 --> 00:41:39,929
Have you found him, Pepita?
Have you found our boy?

665
00:41:41,133 --> 00:41:43,933
- A footprint!
- It's a Rivera boot.

666
00:41:43,935 --> 00:41:45,802
- Size seven!
- And a half.

667
00:41:45,804 --> 00:41:48,254
- Pronated.
- Miguel.

668
00:41:57,750 --> 00:41:59,683
Why the heck would
you want to be a musician?

669
00:41:59,685 --> 00:42:01,552
My great-great-grandpa
was a musician!

670
00:42:01,554 --> 00:42:03,086
Who spent his life
performing like a monkey

671
00:42:03,088 --> 00:42:04,888
for complete strangers.

672
00:42:04,890 --> 00:42:07,291
No thank you.
No! <i>Guacala!</i>

673
00:42:07,293 --> 00:42:09,158
What do you know?

674
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:11,563
So, how far is
this guitar anyway?

675
00:42:11,565 --> 00:42:12,945
We're almost there.

676
00:42:17,770 --> 00:42:19,351
Keep up, <i>chamaco.</i> Come on.

677
00:42:28,014 --> 00:42:32,716
- Cousin Hector!
- Hey! These guys! Hey, <i>Tio!</i>

678
00:42:32,718 --> 00:42:33,851
<i>¿Que onda?</i>

679
00:42:33,853 --> 00:42:35,319
These people are
all your family?

680
00:42:35,321 --> 00:42:36,687
Uh...

681
00:42:36,689 --> 00:42:40,023
In a way. We're all the ones
with no photos or <i>ofrendas.</i>

682
00:42:40,025 --> 00:42:43,160
No family to go home to.
Nearly forgotten, you know?

683
00:42:43,162 --> 00:42:47,313
So, we all call each other
cousin, or <i>tio,</i> or whatever.

684
00:42:51,736 --> 00:42:54,252
- Hector!
- <i>Tia</i> Chelo!

685
00:42:56,041 --> 00:42:58,141
<i>Muchas gracias!</i>

686
00:42:58,143 --> 00:43:00,676
Hey! Save some for me!
Is Chicharron around?

687
00:43:00,679 --> 00:43:01,844
Eh, in the bungalow.

688
00:43:01,846 --> 00:43:04,348
I don't know if he's in
the mood for visitors.

689
00:43:04,350 --> 00:43:07,632
Who doesn't like
a visit from Cousin Hector?

690
00:43:16,795 --> 00:43:18,661
<i>Buenas noches,</i> Chicharron!

691
00:43:18,663 --> 00:43:21,098
I don't want to see
your stupid face, Hector.

692
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:23,166
Come on.
It's <i>Dia de Muertos.</i>

693
00:43:23,168 --> 00:43:24,768
I brought you
a little offering.

694
00:43:24,770 --> 00:43:26,837
- Get out of here.
- I would, Cheech.

695
00:43:26,839 --> 00:43:29,488
But the thing is,
me and my friend, Miguel...

696
00:43:30,643 --> 00:43:32,341
We really need
to borrow your guitar.

697
00:43:32,344 --> 00:43:33,911
- My guitar?
- Yes.

698
00:43:33,913 --> 00:43:36,212
My prized beloved guitar?

699
00:43:36,214 --> 00:43:38,047
I promise
we'll bring it right back.

700
00:43:38,049 --> 00:43:40,717
Like the time you promised
to bring back my van?

701
00:43:40,719 --> 00:43:42,186
- Uh...
- Or my mini-fridge?

702
00:43:42,188 --> 00:43:43,921
- Ah, you see...
- Or my good napkins?

703
00:43:43,923 --> 00:43:45,756
My lasso? My femur?

704
00:43:45,758 --> 00:43:46,989
Well, no,
not like those times.

705
00:43:46,992 --> 00:43:49,326
Where is my femur?
You...

706
00:43:49,328 --> 00:43:51,328
Whoa, whoa.

707
00:43:51,330 --> 00:43:55,247
- You okay, <i>amigo?</i>
- I'm fading, Hector.

708
00:43:55,835 --> 00:43:58,268
I can feel it.

709
00:43:58,271 --> 00:44:01,453
I couldn't even play
that thing if I wanted to.

710
00:44:04,676 --> 00:44:07,211
You play me something.

711
00:44:07,213 --> 00:44:09,279
No. You know
I don't play anymore, Cheech.

712
00:44:09,282 --> 00:44:11,215
The guitar is for the kid.

713
00:44:11,217 --> 00:44:15,000
You want it,
you got to earn it.

714
00:44:16,389 --> 00:44:19,271
<i>Ay,</i> only for you, <i>amigo.</i>

715
00:44:21,826 --> 00:44:23,226
Any requests?

716
00:44:23,228 --> 00:44:27,312
You know my favorite, Hector.

717
00:44:44,784 --> 00:44:48,500
<i>♪ Well,
everyone knows Juanita</i>

718
00:44:49,455 --> 00:44:53,072
<i>♪ Her eyes
each a different color</i>

719
00:44:54,759 --> 00:44:59,444
<i>♪ Her teeth stick out
And her chin goes in</i>

720
00:45:00,399 --> 00:45:03,047
<i>♪ And her...</i>

721
00:45:04,002 --> 00:45:07,136
<i>♪ Knuckles they
drag on the floor</i>

722
00:45:07,138 --> 00:45:09,772
- Those aren't the words.
- There are children present.

723
00:45:09,774 --> 00:45:13,524
<i>♪ Her hair is like a briar</i>

724
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:18,464
<i>♪ She stands in
a bow-legged stance</i>

725
00:45:20,151 --> 00:45:24,469
<i>♪ And if I weren't so ugly</i>

726
00:45:26,158 --> 00:45:31,677
<i>♪ She'd possibly
give me a chance ♪</i>

727
00:45:37,369 --> 00:45:40,084
Brings back memories.

728
00:45:44,243 --> 00:45:46,225
<i>Gracias.</i>

729
00:46:17,143 --> 00:46:19,475
Wait. What happened?

730
00:46:19,477 --> 00:46:21,512
He's been forgotten.

731
00:46:21,514 --> 00:46:23,078
When there's no one left
in the living world

732
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:24,414
who remembers you...

733
00:46:24,416 --> 00:46:27,216
you disappear
from this world.

734
00:46:27,218 --> 00:46:30,153
We call it
the final death.

735
00:46:30,155 --> 00:46:32,355
Where did he go?

736
00:46:32,357 --> 00:46:33,624
No one knows.

737
00:46:33,626 --> 00:46:37,828
But I've met him. I could
remember him when I go back!

738
00:46:37,830 --> 00:46:40,164
No, it doesn't work
like that, <i>chamaco.</i>

739
00:46:40,166 --> 00:46:43,132
Our memories,
they have to be passed down

740
00:46:43,134 --> 00:46:44,968
by those
who knew us in life...

741
00:46:44,971 --> 00:46:48,839
in the stories
they tell about us.

742
00:46:48,841 --> 00:46:51,690
But there's no one left alive
to pass down Cheech's stories.

743
00:46:54,012 --> 00:46:56,179
Hey, it happens
to everyone eventually.

744
00:46:56,181 --> 00:46:59,163
Come on, de la Cruzcito,
you've got a contest to win.

745
00:47:11,264 --> 00:47:13,263
You told me
you hated musicians.

746
00:47:13,266 --> 00:47:14,566
You never said you were one.

747
00:47:14,568 --> 00:47:17,033
How do you think I
knew your great-great-grandpa?

748
00:47:17,035 --> 00:47:18,268
We used to play
music together.

749
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:20,236
Taught him
everything he knows.

750
00:47:20,238 --> 00:47:23,506
<i>No manches!</i> You played
with Ernesto de la Cruz...

751
00:47:23,508 --> 00:47:25,408
the greatest musician
of all time?

752
00:47:25,410 --> 00:47:27,176
Ah, you're funny.

753
00:47:27,178 --> 00:47:29,145
Greatest eyebrows
of all time maybe.

754
00:47:29,147 --> 00:47:31,147
But his music?
Eh, not so much.

755
00:47:31,149 --> 00:47:33,331
You don't know
what you're talking about.

756
00:47:35,288 --> 00:47:38,254
Welcome
to the Plaza de la Cruz!

757
00:47:38,256 --> 00:47:40,505
Showtime, <i>chamaco!</i>

758
00:47:46,531 --> 00:47:49,916
<i>Llevelo!</i>
T-shirts! Bobbleheads!

759
00:47:56,174 --> 00:47:59,910
<i>Bienvenidos a todos!</i>

760
00:47:59,912 --> 00:48:01,911
Oh!

761
00:48:01,913 --> 00:48:06,449
Who's ready for some <i>musica?</i>

762
00:48:06,451 --> 00:48:09,085
It's a battle
of the bands, <i>amigos.</i>

763
00:48:09,087 --> 00:48:12,155
The winner gets to play
for the maestro himself,

764
00:48:12,157 --> 00:48:14,190
Ernesto de la Cruz...

765
00:48:14,192 --> 00:48:17,027
at his <i>fiesta</i> tonight!

766
00:48:17,029 --> 00:48:18,560
That's our ticket, <i>muchacho.</i>

767
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:20,697
Oh! Oh, oh, oh!

768
00:48:20,699 --> 00:48:23,600
Let the competition begin!

769
00:48:40,118 --> 00:48:42,186
So, what's the plan?
What are you gonna play?

770
00:48:42,188 --> 00:48:43,585
Definitely <i>Remember Me.</i>

771
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:44,987
No! Not that one. No.

772
00:48:44,990 --> 00:48:47,056
Come on.
It's his most popular song!

773
00:48:47,058 --> 00:48:48,358
Ah, it's too popular.

774
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:50,461
<i>♪ Remember me
Though I have to travel far ♪</i>

775
00:48:50,463 --> 00:48:51,627
<i>♪ Remember me... ♪</i>

776
00:48:51,630 --> 00:48:53,629
<i>♪ Don't let it
make you cry... ♪</i>

777
00:48:58,204 --> 00:49:01,638
- What about <i>Poco Loco?</i>
- <i>Epa!</i> Now that's a song!

778
00:49:01,641 --> 00:49:03,540
De la Cruzcito?
You're on standby.

779
00:49:03,542 --> 00:49:05,557
Los Chachalacos,
you're up next.

780
00:49:06,746 --> 00:49:08,645
Los Chachalacos!

781
00:49:19,759 --> 00:49:21,758
You always this nervous
before a performance?

782
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:25,094
I don't know.
I've never performed before.

783
00:49:25,096 --> 00:49:27,030
What? You said
you were a musician!

784
00:49:27,032 --> 00:49:28,998
I am!
I mean, I will be.

785
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,400
- <i>Ay!</i>
- Once I win.

786
00:49:30,402 --> 00:49:33,002
That's your plan?
No. You have to win.

787
00:49:33,004 --> 00:49:34,571
Your life
literally depends on...

788
00:49:34,574 --> 00:49:36,139
you winning. And you've
never done this before!

789
00:49:36,141 --> 00:49:37,306
I'll go up there.

790
00:49:37,309 --> 00:49:39,641
- No! I need to do this.
- Why?

791
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:42,111
If I can't go out
and play one song,

792
00:49:42,113 --> 00:49:44,013
how can I call
myself a musician?

793
00:49:44,015 --> 00:49:45,382
What does that matter?

794
00:49:45,384 --> 00:49:47,283
Because I don't just want to
get de la Cruz's blessing...

795
00:49:47,285 --> 00:49:51,789
I need to prove
that I'm worthy of it.

796
00:49:51,791 --> 00:49:54,691
Oh, that's such
a sweet sentiment

797
00:49:54,693 --> 00:49:57,161
at such a bad time!

798
00:49:59,464 --> 00:50:01,730
Okay! Okay.
You want to perform?

799
00:50:01,732 --> 00:50:03,534
Then you got to perform!

800
00:50:03,536 --> 00:50:06,537
First, you have to loosen up.
Shake off those nerves.

801
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:12,275
Now give me
your best <i>grito.</i>

802
00:50:12,277 --> 00:50:15,026
- My best <i>grito?</i>
- Come on, yell! Belt it out.

803
00:50:18,184 --> 00:50:21,633
Ah, it feels good.
Okay, now you.

804
00:50:26,626 --> 00:50:28,640
Oh, come on, kid.

805
00:50:39,337 --> 00:50:41,304
De la Cruzcito,
you're on now!

806
00:50:41,306 --> 00:50:43,574
Miguel, look at me.
Hey, look at me.

807
00:50:43,576 --> 00:50:44,774
You can do this.

808
00:50:44,776 --> 00:50:47,311
Grab their attention
and don't let it go.

809
00:50:47,313 --> 00:50:49,511
Make them listen, <i>chamaco.</i>
You've got this.

810
00:50:49,513 --> 00:50:52,115
De la Cruzcito

811
00:51:00,659 --> 00:51:03,326
What's he doing?
Why isn't he playing?

812
00:51:03,328 --> 00:51:05,627
Bring back
the singing dogs!

813
00:51:17,677 --> 00:51:20,827

Not so bad yourself,

Please be on the lookout
for a living boy.

Answers to the name
of Miguel.

843
00:53:33,410 --> 00:53:36,646
Earlier tonight
he ran away from his family.

844
00:53:36,648 --> 00:53:39,781
They just want to send him back
to the Land of the Living.

845
00:53:39,783 --> 00:53:41,350
Wait, wait.

was your only family.

who could send you home.

848
00:53:44,955 --> 00:53:46,121
I do have other family,
but...

00:53:46,123 --> 00:53:48,390
You could have taken my

850
00:53:48,392 --> 00:53:51,362
But they hate music!
I need a musician's blessing.

851
00:53:51,364 --> 00:53:53,663
- You lied to me!
- Oh, you're one to talk.

852
00:53:53,665 --> 00:53:55,665
Look at me.
I'm being forgotten, Miguel.

853

You're not a spirit guide.
You're just a dumb dog!

Oh, I loved it!
I remember that feeling...

888
00:55:58,657 --> 00:56:02,424
when my husband would play,
and I would sing

889
00:56:02,426 --> 00:56:05,075
and nothing else mattered.

890
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:08,431
But when we had Coco,

01:04:58,063 --> 01:05:01,297
That's crazy! De la Cruz
wrote all his own songs.

1017
01:05:01,299 --> 01:05:03,198
You want to tell him
or should I?

1018
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:05,600
Hector, I never meant
to take credit.

1019
01:05:05,602 --> 01:05:09,171
We made a great team,
but you died...

1020
01:05:09,173 --> 01:05:11,205
and I only sang your songs

1021
01:05:11,207 --> 01:05:14,208
because I wanted to keep
a part of you alive.

1022
01:05:14,210 --> 01:05:15,944
Oh, how generous!

1023
01:05:15,946 --> 01:05:18,180
You really did
play together.

1024
01:05:18,182 --> 01:05:20,515
I don't want
to fight about it.

1025
01:05:20,517 --> 01:05:22,350
I just want you
to make it right.

1026
01:05:22,353 --> 01:05:26,403
Miguel can put my photo up, and
I can cross over the bridge.

1027
01:05:27,223 --> 01:05:29,123
I can see my girl.

1028
01:05:29,125 --> 01:05:32,095
Ernesto,
remember the night I left?

1029
01:05:32,097 --> 01:05:33,629
That was a long time ago.

1030
01:05:33,632 --> 01:05:35,263
We drank together
and you told me

1031
01:05:35,265 --> 01:05:37,232
you would move
Heaven and Earth...

1032
01:05:37,234 --> 01:05:41,204
for your <i>amigo.</i>
Well, I'm asking you to now.

1033
01:05:41,206 --> 01:05:43,504
Heaven and Earth?
Like in the movie?

1034
01:05:43,506 --> 01:05:46,241
- What?
- That's Don Hidalgo's toast.

1035
01:05:46,243 --> 01:05:48,744
In the de la Cruz movie,
<i>El Camino a Casa.</i>

1036
01:05:48,746 --> 01:05:50,145
I'm talking about
my real life, Miguel.

1037
01:05:50,147 --> 01:05:52,982
No! It's in there. Look!

1038
01:05:52,984 --> 01:05:54,350
<i>Never were
truer words spoken.</i>

1039
01:05:54,352 --> 01:05:57,518
<i>This calls for a toast.
To our friendship!</i>

1040
01:05:57,520 --> 01:06:00,222
<i>I would move Heaven and Earth
for you,</i> mi amigo.

1041
01:06:00,224 --> 01:06:03,359
But in the movie, Don
Hidalgo poisons the drink.

1042
01:06:03,361 --> 01:06:06,310
- Salud!
<i>- Poison!</i>

1043
01:06:08,265 --> 01:06:12,769
That night, Ernesto.
The night I left...

1044
01:06:12,771 --> 01:06:15,370
<i>We'd been performing
on the road for months.</i>

1045
01:06:15,372 --> 01:06:16,672
<i>I got homesick...</i>

1046
01:06:16,675 --> 01:06:18,457
<i>and I packed up my songs.</i>

1047
01:06:19,009 --> 01:06:20,043
You want to give up now

1048
01:06:20,045 --> 01:06:22,512
when we're this close
to reaching our dream?

1049
01:06:22,514 --> 01:06:24,545
This was your dream.
You'll manage.

1050
01:06:24,547 --> 01:06:26,547
I can't do this
without your songs, Hector.

1051
01:06:26,549 --> 01:06:27,716
I'm going home, Ernesto.

1052
01:06:27,718 --> 01:06:30,468
Hate me if you want,
but my mind is made up.

1053
01:06:33,525 --> 01:06:36,793
Oh, I could never hate you.
If you must go,

1054
01:06:36,795 --> 01:06:39,909
then I'm sending you off
with a toast.

1055
01:06:43,466 --> 01:06:44,733
To our friendship.

1056
01:06:44,735 --> 01:06:49,352
I would move Heaven and Earth
for you, <i>mi amigo. Salud!</i>

1057
01:06:53,676 --> 01:06:55,445
<i>You walked me
to the train station.</i>

1058
01:06:55,447 --> 01:06:58,312
<i>But I felt
a pain in my stomach.</i>

1059
01:06:58,314 --> 01:07:00,582
<i>I thought it must have been
something I ate.</i>

1060
01:07:00,584 --> 01:07:03,086
Perhaps it was
that <i>chorizo,</i> my friend.

1061
01:07:03,088 --> 01:07:05,636
<i>Or something I drank.</i>

1062
01:07:09,060 --> 01:07:10,908
<i>I woke up dead.</i>

1063
01:07:12,495 --> 01:07:14,763
You poisoned me.

1064
01:07:14,765 --> 01:07:18,300
You're confusing movies
with reality, Hector.

1065
01:07:18,302 --> 01:07:21,951
All this time, I thought
it was just bad luck.

1066
01:07:23,339 --> 01:07:27,058
<i>I never thought that
you might have... That you...</i>

1067
01:07:30,849 --> 01:07:32,714
- How could you?
- Hector!

1068
01:07:32,716 --> 01:07:34,066
Security! Security!

1069
01:07:34,718 --> 01:07:38,803
You took everything
away from me! You rat!

1070
01:07:39,757 --> 01:07:43,325
Have him taken care of.
He's not well.

1071
01:07:43,327 --> 01:07:48,112
I just wanted to go back home.
No! No!

1072
01:07:49,265 --> 01:07:52,601
I apologize.
Where were we?

1073
01:07:52,603 --> 01:07:54,803
You were going to give me
your blessing.

1074
01:07:54,805 --> 01:07:57,456
Yes. Uh, <i>si.</i>

1075
01:08:00,377 --> 01:08:04,212
Miguel, uh,
my reputation...

1076
01:08:04,214 --> 01:08:07,683
It is
very important to me.

1077
01:08:07,686 --> 01:08:09,786
I would hate
to have you think...

1078
01:08:09,788 --> 01:08:13,821
That you murdered Hector
for his songs?

1079
01:08:15,260 --> 01:08:18,559
You don't think that.
Do you?

1080
01:08:18,561 --> 01:08:23,546
I... No. Everyone
knows you're the good guy.

1081
01:08:29,772 --> 01:08:32,857
<i>Papa</i> Ernesto, my blessing?

1082
01:08:34,812 --> 01:08:39,581
Security? Take care of Miguel.
He'll be extending his stay.

1083
01:08:39,583 --> 01:08:42,719
What? But I'm your family!

1084
01:08:42,721 --> 01:08:45,288
And Hector
was my best friend.

1085
01:08:45,290 --> 01:08:48,689
Success doesn't
come for free, Miguel.

1086
01:08:48,691 --> 01:08:50,858
You have to be willing to do
whatever it takes

1087
01:08:50,860 --> 01:08:54,328
to seize your moment.

1088
01:08:54,330 --> 01:08:55,913
I know you understand.

1089
01:08:56,300 --> 01:08:58,848
No! No!

1090
01:09:00,538 --> 01:09:03,472
Let go! No!

1091
01:09:25,896 --> 01:09:30,233
Help!
Can anyone hear me?

1092
01:09:30,235 --> 01:09:32,683
I want to go home.

1093
01:09:51,222 --> 01:09:52,889
- Hector?
- Kid?

1094
01:09:52,891 --> 01:09:55,756
Oh, Hector!
You were right.

1095
01:09:55,758 --> 01:09:58,360
I should have gone
back to my family.

1096
01:09:58,362 --> 01:10:00,929
They told me not
to be like de la Cruz,

1097
01:10:00,931 --> 01:10:02,764
but I didn't listen.

1098
01:10:02,766 --> 01:10:05,766
I told them I didn't care
if they remembered me.

1099
01:10:05,768 --> 01:10:09,337
I didn't care if I was
on their stupid <i>ofrenda.</i>

1100
01:10:09,340 --> 01:10:12,241
Hey, <i>chamaco.</i>
It's okay. It's okay.

1101
01:10:12,243 --> 01:10:14,860
I told them I didn't care.

1102
01:10:18,549 --> 01:10:21,731
Hector! Hector?

1103
01:10:22,418 --> 01:10:25,654
She's forgetting me.

1104
01:10:25,656 --> 01:10:28,938
- Who?
- My daughter.

1105
01:10:31,362 --> 01:10:35,796
She's the reason you wanted
to cross the bridge.

1106
01:10:35,798 --> 01:10:39,301
I just wanted
to see her again.

1107
01:10:39,303 --> 01:10:41,986
I never should have
left Santa Cecilia.

1108
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:45,040
I wish I could apologize.

1109
01:10:45,042 --> 01:10:49,044
I wish I could tell her that her
<i>papa</i> was trying to come home.

1110
01:10:49,046 --> 01:10:51,630
That he loved her so much.

1111
01:10:53,951 --> 01:10:55,865
My Coco...

1112
01:10:57,788 --> 01:10:59,603
Coco?

1113
01:11:15,472 --> 01:11:18,806
Where did you get this?

1114
01:11:18,808 --> 01:11:22,625
That's my <i>Mama</i> Coco.
That's my <i>Mama</i> Imelda.

1115
01:11:23,579 --> 01:11:26,664
Is that you?

1116
01:11:30,321 --> 01:11:33,803
- We're...
- Family?

1117
01:11:46,004 --> 01:11:48,703
I always hoped
I'd see her again.

1118
01:11:48,706 --> 01:11:51,105
That she'd miss me.

1119
01:11:51,107 --> 01:11:55,191
Maybe put up my photo.
But it never happened.

1120
01:11:56,348 --> 01:11:58,479
You know the worst part?

1121
01:11:58,481 --> 01:12:00,748
Even if I never got to see
Coco in the living world...

1122
01:12:00,750 --> 01:12:04,353
I thought at least
one day I'd see her here.

1123
01:12:04,356 --> 01:12:06,070
Give her the biggest hug.

1124
01:12:08,026 --> 01:12:11,859
But she's the last person
who remembers me.

1125
01:12:11,861 --> 01:12:14,129
The moment she's gone
from the living world...

1126
01:12:14,131 --> 01:12:18,033
You disappear...
from this one.

1127
01:12:18,035 --> 01:12:19,900
You'll never get to see her.

1128
01:12:19,902 --> 01:12:21,919
Ever again.

1129
01:12:24,908 --> 01:12:28,043
You know,
I wrote her a song once.

1130
01:12:28,045 --> 01:12:32,047
We used to sing it every
night at the same time.

1131
01:12:32,049 --> 01:12:34,797
No matter
how far apart we were.

1132
01:12:35,754 --> 01:12:38,420
What I wouldn't give
to sing it to her

1133
01:12:38,422 --> 01:12:41,371
one... last... time.

1134
01:12:43,394 --> 01:12:47,095
<i>♪ Remember me</i>

1135
01:12:47,097 --> 01:12:51,949
<i>♪ Though I have to say
goodbye Remember me</i>

1136
01:12:52,902 --> 01:12:55,937
<i>♪ Don't let it make you cry</i>

1137
01:12:55,939 --> 01:13:01,809
<i>♪ For even if I'm far away

1138
01:13:01,811 --> 01:13:07,764

1139
01:13:08,686 --> 01:13:11,051

01:13:11,054 --> 01:13:12,386

1146
01:13:48,491 --> 01:13:52,594
He stole your guitar.
He stole your songs.

1147
01:13:52,596 --> 01:13:56,230
You should be the one the world
remembers, not de la Cruz!

1148
01:13:56,232 --> 01:13:59,000
I didn't write <i>Remember Me</i>
for the world.

1149
01:13:59,003 --> 01:14:00,918
I wrote it for Coco.

1150
01:14:02,606 --> 01:14:05,607
I'm a pretty sorry excuse
for a great-great-grandpa.

1151
01:14:05,609 --> 01:14:08,876
Are you kidding? A minute ago I
thought I was related to a murderer.

1152
01:14:08,878 --> 01:14:11,145
You're a total upgrade.

1153
01:14:11,147 --> 01:14:13,782
My whole life,
there's been something...

1154
01:14:13,784 --> 01:14:15,516
that made me different.

1155
01:14:15,518 --> 01:14:17,802
And I never knew
where it came from.

1156
01:14:18,622 --> 01:14:22,157
But now I know.
It comes from you.

1157
01:14:22,159 --> 01:14:27,028
I'm proud we're family!
I'm proud to be his family!

1158
01:14:34,038 --> 01:14:36,805
I'm proud to be
his family!

1159
01:14:51,754 --> 01:14:53,654
Dante?

1160
01:14:53,656 --> 01:14:56,090
Dante!

1161
01:14:58,662 --> 01:15:00,244
It's Dante!

1162
01:15:11,842 --> 01:15:15,126
- Imelda!
- Hector.

1163
01:15:15,547 --> 01:15:17,128
You look good.

1164
01:15:28,293 --> 01:15:31,560
Dante! You knew he was my
<i>Papa</i> Hector the whole time!

1165
01:15:31,562 --> 01:15:33,563
You are a real spirit guide.

1166
01:15:33,565 --> 01:15:36,096
Who's the good spirit guide?
You are!

1167
01:15:47,009 --> 01:15:48,325
Whoa!

1168
01:15:55,718 --> 01:15:57,267
Dante!

1169
01:16:20,910 --> 01:16:22,211
There they are!

1170
01:16:22,213 --> 01:16:26,564
Miguel! Miguelito! Look, it's Miguel!
He's all right.

1171
01:16:28,017 --> 01:16:31,067
<i>Gracias, Dios mio.
Que bueno.</i>

1172
01:16:45,169 --> 01:16:47,202
<i>Mijo,</i> I was so worried!

1173
01:16:47,204 --> 01:16:49,453
Thank goodness
we found you in time.

1174
01:16:50,406 --> 01:16:53,942
And you... How many times
must I turn you away?

1175
01:16:53,944 --> 01:16:55,210
Imelda.

1176
01:16:55,212 --> 01:16:58,412
I want nothing to do with you!
Not in life, not in death!

1177
01:16:58,414 --> 01:17:02,050
I spent decades protecting
my family from your mistakes.

1178
01:17:02,052 --> 01:17:04,051
He spends
five minutes with you

1179
01:17:04,053 --> 01:17:05,787
and I have to fish him
out of a sinkhole!

1180
01:17:05,789 --> 01:17:07,322
I wasn't in there
because of Hector.

1181
01:17:07,324 --> 01:17:09,957
He was in there
because of me.

1182
01:17:09,959 --> 01:17:12,227
He was just
trying to get me home!

1183
01:17:12,229 --> 01:17:16,697
I didn't want to listen,
but he was right.

1184
01:17:16,699 --> 01:17:18,982
Nothing's more
important than family.

1185
01:17:19,937 --> 01:17:22,620
I'm ready
to accept your blessing.

1186
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:25,072
And your conditions.

1187
01:17:25,074 --> 01:17:27,375
But first,
I need to find de la Cruz.

1188
01:17:27,378 --> 01:17:29,243
To get Hector's photo.

1189
01:17:29,245 --> 01:17:30,945
- What?
- So he can see Coco again.

1190
01:17:30,947 --> 01:17:32,847
Hector should be
on our <i>ofrenda.</i>

1191
01:17:32,849 --> 01:17:34,315
He's part of our family.

1192
01:17:34,317 --> 01:17:35,783
He left this family!

1193
01:17:35,785 --> 01:17:37,452
He tried to go home
to you and Coco.

1194
01:17:37,454 --> 01:17:39,436
But de la Cruz
murdered him!

1195
01:17:40,391 --> 01:17:42,239
It's true, Imelda.

1196
01:17:42,993 --> 01:17:44,458
And so what if it's true?

1197
01:17:44,460 --> 01:17:46,962
You leave me alone
with a child to raise...

1198
01:17:46,964 --> 01:17:49,064
and I'm just
supposed to forgive you?

1199
01:17:49,066 --> 01:17:50,998
Imelda, I...

1200
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,234
Hector!

1201
01:17:54,838 --> 01:17:58,588
I'm running out of time.
It's Coco.

1202
01:17:59,743 --> 01:18:01,424
She's forgetting you.

1203
01:18:02,378 --> 01:18:05,212
You don't have
to forgive him.

1204
01:18:05,214 --> 01:18:07,530
But we shouldn't
forget him.

1205
01:18:09,953 --> 01:18:13,355
I wanted to forget you.

1206
01:18:13,357 --> 01:18:16,257
I wanted Coco
to forget you too, but...

1207
01:18:16,259 --> 01:18:19,309
This is my fault.
Not yours.

1208
01:18:21,365 --> 01:18:23,513
I'm sorry, Imelda.

1209
01:18:27,404 --> 01:18:31,139
Miguel, if we help you
get his photo,

1210
01:18:31,141 --> 01:18:32,873
you will return home?

1211
01:18:32,875 --> 01:18:34,458
No more music?

1212
01:18:35,412 --> 01:18:38,061
Family comes first.

1213
01:18:39,749 --> 01:18:43,199
I can't forgive you.

1214
01:18:45,422 --> 01:18:47,371
But I will help you.

1215
01:18:48,324 --> 01:18:51,307
So, how do we get
to de la Cruz?

1216
01:18:52,262 --> 01:18:55,078
I might know a way.

1217
01:19:45,481 --> 01:19:48,097
- Good luck, <i>muchacho.</i>
- <i>Gracias,</i> Frida.

1218
01:19:56,592 --> 01:19:59,861
- Here, let me help you with...
- Don't touch me!

1219
01:19:59,863 --> 01:20:02,130
- Everyone clear on the plan?
- Find Hector's photo.

1220
01:20:02,132 --> 01:20:03,965
- Give it to Miguel.
- Send Miguel home.

1221
01:20:03,967 --> 01:20:05,816
Got your petals?

1222
01:20:06,837 --> 01:20:08,469
Now, we just
have to find de la Cruz.

1223
01:20:08,471 --> 01:20:09,786
Yes?

1224
01:20:10,606 --> 01:20:12,556
Don't I know you?

1225
01:20:13,409 --> 01:20:16,144
That's for murdering
the love of my life!

1226
01:20:16,146 --> 01:20:18,212
- Who... Who the...
- She's talking about me!

1227
01:20:18,214 --> 01:20:19,514
I'm the love of your life?

1228
01:20:19,516 --> 01:20:21,283
I don't know.
I'm still angry at you.

1229
01:20:21,285 --> 01:20:22,617
Hector!
How did you...

1230
01:20:22,619 --> 01:20:25,554
And that's for trying
to murder my grandson.

1231
01:20:25,556 --> 01:20:27,956
- Grandson?
- She's talking about me!

1232
01:20:27,958 --> 01:20:32,126
You! Wait.
You're related to Hector?

1233
01:20:32,128 --> 01:20:33,677
The photo!

1234
01:20:35,398 --> 01:20:37,032
Uh...

1235
01:20:37,034 --> 01:20:38,748
After him!

1236
01:20:40,904 --> 01:20:43,105
Security! <i>Ayudenme!</i>

1237
01:20:43,107 --> 01:20:46,174
- You said love of your life.
- I don't know what I said.

1238
01:20:46,176 --> 01:20:47,590
That's what I heard.

1239
01:21:00,891 --> 01:21:02,873
Places, <i>Senor.</i>
You're on in thirty seconds.

1240
01:21:09,432 --> 01:21:12,349
<i>Ay!</i> Miguel! I have it!

1241
01:21:21,044 --> 01:21:22,359
Oh!

1242
01:21:28,284 --> 01:21:29,899
Hurry! Come on!

01:21:48,371 --> 01:21:49,604
Get her off the stage.

01:21:58,315 --> 01:22:01,364

You still got it.

1270
01:23:56,065 --> 01:23:58,715
Oh.

1271
01:24:01,236 --> 01:24:04,320
Miguel,
I give you my blessing.

1272
01:24:05,507 --> 01:24:09,510
To go home,
to put up our photos

1273
01:24:09,512 --> 01:24:11,278
and to never...

1274
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:13,696
Never play music again.

1275
01:24:14,650 --> 01:24:19,601
To never forget how much
your family loves you.

1276
01:24:21,824 --> 01:24:23,605
You're going home.

1277
01:24:27,130 --> 01:24:29,131
You're not going anywhere.

1278
01:24:30,799 --> 01:24:31,867
Imelda!

1279
01:24:31,869 --> 01:24:33,300
Stay back!
Stay back!

1280
01:24:33,302 --> 01:24:37,537
All of you, stay back.
Not one more step.

1281
01:24:39,308 --> 01:24:40,825
Dante!

1282
01:24:42,212 --> 01:24:46,515
Ernesto, stop!
Leave the boy alone.

1283
01:24:46,517 --> 01:24:48,448
I've worked too hard, Hector.

1284
01:24:48,450 --> 01:24:50,786
Too hard to let him
destroy everything.

1285
01:24:50,788 --> 01:24:52,854
He's a living child, Ernesto.

1286
01:24:52,856 --> 01:24:54,455
He's a threat!

1287
01:24:54,457 --> 01:24:56,290
<i>You think
I'd let him go back</i>

1288
01:24:56,292 --> 01:24:58,291
<i>to the Land of the Living
with your photo?</i>

1289
01:24:58,293 --> 01:25:01,363
To keep
your memory alive? No.

1290
01:25:01,365 --> 01:25:04,232
- You're a coward!
- I am Ernesto de la Cruz.

1291
01:25:04,234 --> 01:25:06,167
The greatest musician
of all time!

1292
01:25:06,169 --> 01:25:08,135
Hector's the real musician.

1293
01:25:08,137 --> 01:25:09,438
<i>You're just the guy
who murdered him</i>

1294
01:25:09,440 --> 01:25:10,671
<i>and stole his songs!</i>

1295
01:25:10,673 --> 01:25:11,839
Murdered?

1296
01:25:11,841 --> 01:25:13,773
I am the one
who's willing to do

1297
01:25:13,775 --> 01:25:15,792
what it takes
to seize my moment.

1298
01:25:16,212 --> 01:25:17,927
Whatever it takes.

1299
01:25:18,648 --> 01:25:21,415
No!

1300
01:25:23,485 --> 01:25:25,654
Miguel!

1301
01:25:25,656 --> 01:25:29,406
Apologies, old friend.
But the show must go on.

1302
01:26:11,366 --> 01:26:14,235
Please,
please, <i>mi familia.</i>

1303
01:26:14,237 --> 01:26:16,304
Murderer!

1304
01:26:16,306 --> 01:26:18,805
Orchestra.
A-one, a-two, a-one...

1305

1306
01:26:24,580 --> 01:26:25,881
Hey!

1307
01:26:26,983 --> 01:26:28,498
Look!

1308
01:26:48,638 --> 01:26:51,006
Nice kitty.

1309
01:26:54,244 --> 01:26:58,746
Put me down! No, please! I beg of you!
Stop! Stop! No!

1310
01:27:07,423 --> 01:27:09,038
No! No!

1311
01:27:20,571 --> 01:27:21,868
What did I miss?

1312
01:27:21,870 --> 01:27:23,672
Good boy, Dante!

1313
01:27:23,674 --> 01:27:24,989
Miguel!

1314
01:27:26,409 --> 01:27:30,746
Hector!
The photo... I lost it!

1315
01:27:30,748 --> 01:27:33,681
It's okay, <i>mijo.</i>
It's o...

1316
01:27:33,683 --> 01:27:36,598
Hector! Hector?

1317
01:27:37,487 --> 01:27:38,618
Coco.

1318
01:27:38,620 --> 01:27:41,056
No! We can still
find the photo.

1319
01:27:41,058 --> 01:27:43,007
Miguel, it's almost sunrise.

1320
01:27:43,960 --> 01:27:45,725
No, no. I can't leave you.

1321
01:27:45,727 --> 01:27:48,296
I promised
I'd put your photo up.

1322
01:27:48,298 --> 01:27:50,431
I promised you'd see Coco.

1323
01:27:50,433 --> 01:27:52,816
We're both
out of time, <i>mijo.</i>

1324
01:27:53,771 --> 01:27:57,037
Oh no! No!
She can't forget you!

1325
01:27:57,040 --> 01:28:01,223
I just wanted her to know
that I loved her.

1326
01:28:02,378 --> 01:28:03,444
Hector!

1327
01:28:03,446 --> 01:28:05,761
You have our blessing,
Miguel.

1328
01:28:05,982 --> 01:28:08,516
No conditions.

1329
01:28:08,518 --> 01:28:11,633
No! <i>Papa</i> Hector, please!

1330
01:28:15,490 --> 01:28:16,838
No!

1331
01:28:17,794 --> 01:28:18,960
Go home.

1332
01:28:18,962 --> 01:28:22,178
I promise I won't let Coco forget you!

1333
01:28:49,057 --> 01:28:50,772
There he is!

1334
01:28:51,793 --> 01:28:53,876
Miguel! Stop!

1335
01:28:58,835 --> 01:29:00,401
Where have you been?

1336
01:29:00,403 --> 01:29:02,068
I need to see
<i>Mama</i> Coco, please.

1337
01:29:02,070 --> 01:29:05,139
What are you doing with that...
Give it to me!

1338
01:29:05,141 --> 01:29:08,944
Miguel, stop!
Miguel! Miguel!

1339
01:29:10,879 --> 01:29:15,416
<i>Mama</i> Coco? Can you hear me?
It's Miguel.

1340
01:29:15,418 --> 01:29:20,086
I saw your <i>papa.</i>
Remember? <i>Papa?</i>

1341
01:29:20,088 --> 01:29:26,494
Please! If you forget him,
he'll be gone. Forever.

1342
01:29:26,496 --> 01:29:27,995
Miguel,
open this door!

1343
01:29:27,997 --> 01:29:30,831
Here. This was
his guitar, right?

1344
01:29:30,833 --> 01:29:32,315
He used to play it to you?

1345
01:29:34,972 --> 01:29:39,005
See? There he is! <i>Papa!</i>

1346
01:29:39,007 --> 01:29:41,223
Remember? <i>Papa?</i>

1347
01:29:44,646 --> 01:29:45,713
Miguel!

1348
01:29:45,715 --> 01:29:48,798
<i>Mama</i> Coco, please!
Don't forget him.

1349
01:29:55,091 --> 01:29:57,056
What are you doing
to that poor woman?

1350
01:29:57,058 --> 01:29:58,559
It's okay, <i>Mamita.</i>
It's okay.

1351
01:29:58,561 --> 01:29:59,827
What's gotten into you?

1352
01:30:06,502 --> 01:30:08,170
I thought
I'd lost you, Miguel.

1353
01:30:08,172 --> 01:30:09,836
I'm sorry, <i>Papa.</i>

1354
01:30:09,838 --> 01:30:13,188
We're all together now.
That's what matters.

1355
01:30:13,910 --> 01:30:15,176
