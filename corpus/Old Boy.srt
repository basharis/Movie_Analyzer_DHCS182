1
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,404
I hope so.

2
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,281
- All right, you guys gotta call me.
- Yeah.

3
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,051
Make this happen.
Make this happen, all right?

4
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,965
See you guys. See you. All right.

5
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:45,324
- Joey, what's up? The usual?
- Yeah.

6
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:10,210
Thanks, Willy.
I hope you had a nice night.

7
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,090
Yes, sir.

8
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,045
What about that new place?

9
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,925
Oh, girl, I gotta go. Bye.

10
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,169
You're late.
Time is a relative thing, doll.

11
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,885
Mr. Hardigan, he's furious.

12
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:25,203
Mr. Blumenthal's threatening
to take his business elsewhere.

13
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,523
Guy named Pat Vinelli said
stay away from his sister or else.

14
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,610
Patricia. Mm. Mm.
Oh, and this one, your ex-wife,

15
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,167
Donna Hawthorne?
She's really pissed.

16
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,647
She's always pissed.
I don't blame her.

17
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,930
Damn.

18
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,324
Mr. Sharkey, he's in his office.

19
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,970
Ay-yi-yi.

20
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,322
There he is.
Hey, boss man.

21
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,688
Joe, how you doing?
Good. Oh!

22
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,730
Oh, I'm sorry.
Oh, let me take a look at those.

23
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,321
Watch the fight?
I didn't. I was working.

24
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,006
Talk to me about Newcombe.
Are you gonna bag him?

25
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:03,131
This is a make it or break it for us.
Got dinner tonight at the Pinnacle.

26
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,363
Pinnacle? Oof. Expensive.
Yup. Oof. Necessary.

27
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,522
All right, reel him in.
I always do.

28
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,088
If you don't, we're fucked.
Now, let me make this very clear.

29
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,645
If you don't, I'm...

30
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,041
you're fucked.
Got it. I got the deal.

31
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,410
Clean yourself up a little bit. Put on
your best suit. Wear cologne, smell good.

32
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,245
Aramis. That chickie of his likes you.
Love it.

33
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,126
You knock them out, champ.
I will. Bob and weave. Bob and weave.

34
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,690
Boxing.

35
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,610
Primitive.

36
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,401
- Yeah, Joe Doucett.
<i>- That was a long lunch.</i>

37
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,565
What can I do for you?
You know what day this is?

38
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,411
Yes, I do. It's the 8th of October,

39
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:50,527
the year of our Lord 1993, which means
that I'm late with my child support again.

40
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,007
That is not why I'm calling, you know it.

41
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,410
<i>I asked you to come to Mia's party three
weeks ago, you never called me back.</i>

42
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,688
Well, I can't make it, Donna.
<i>Why not?</i>

43
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:04,130
Because I have a big client dinner.
<i>Ha. Well, that's way more important</i>

44
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:08,285
<i>than your daughter's birthday.</i>
Listen, she is 3 years old, okay?

45
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:13,122
Three years old, okay? Do you think
she cares whether I'm there or not?

46
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,685
You know what, Joe?

47
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,008
As a husband, as a father,

48
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:21,808
you are a fucking joke!
You know what? You're a bitch, Donna.

49
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,367
What did you say?
You're a fucking bitch!

50
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,847
<i>Fuck...</i>
Fuck!

51
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,884
<i>We don't make ads for Joe Doakes.</i>

52
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,203
<i>No, John Q. Public, John and
Jane Doe, Mr. Everyman.</i>

53
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,044
<i>No, no, no.</i>

54
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,447
<i>We make ads for Daniel Newcombe.</i>

55
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,086
<i>We make ads for Joe Doucett.</i>

56
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:45,006
<i>We cater to the elite,
the crème de la crème.</i>

57
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:48,682
Celebrities, athletes,
entertainers, rappers.

58
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:52,925
All in a Daniel Newcombe fine motor
vehicle. That's what I'm gonna do for you.

59
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,727
It's a really great idea.
It's a great idea. Listen to the lady.

60
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,844
I'm gonna give you a shot.
That's what I like to hear.

61
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,566
Call me at the office first thing Monday.
I will do so, sir.

62
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,568
I've gotta make a call.
Please excuse me.

63
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,291
You gotta do business
when you gotta do business.

64
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,046
Don't be long? Okay.
I'll be right back, baby.

65
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,083
- A beautiful couple.
- He's the best.

66
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,362
You won't regret it. I promise you.

67
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,841
Congratulations.

68
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:28,362
Thank you, Judy. I don't think
I could've done that without you.

69
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,766
Oh, sure you could've.

70
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:33,362
Laughing at all my jokes,
telling him what great ideas I have.

71
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,887
They are great ideas.
I appreciate that.

72
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,051
From one bullshit artist to another.
Listen.

73
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:45,087
I was thinking,
what do you say you and I,

74
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:48,563
we get together this weekend,
ditch the old man,

75
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,445
bottle of Scotch, eight ball of coke,

76
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,969
dirty movies on Skinemax?

77
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,441
What? Excuse me? Heh.

78
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,802
Let me get this straight.

79
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,608
You think I said those things
because I wanna fuck you?

80
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,444
Yeah.
No.

81
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,291
No?
No. I wanna get out of here

82
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:12,007
and away from you
as fast as humanly possible.

83
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,409
Daniel likes you, God knows why.
Okay.

84
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,802
Yeah? But, Joe?

85
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,047
You're a dick.

86
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,527
And I would rather fuck a corpse.

87
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,085
Joe.

88
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,448
You wanna disrespect me?
No. I didn't...

89
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,325
That's all right.
It was just a misunderstanding.

90
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,921
I'm a big boy. I'm a big boy.
I can take it.

91
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,241
Okay.

92
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,683
But you disrespect the woman I love,
son, that's...

93
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,003
- That's just plain stupid.
- It was just a misunderstanding.

94
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,603
Let's go, baby.

95
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,651
He's not worth the trouble.

96
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,645
Mm.

97
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,324
Mm. Uh!

98
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,204
I'm dry!

99
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,368
Does anybody have any more alcohol?

100
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,840
Shut the fuck up!

101
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:07,762
Does anyone have more alcohol?

102
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,285
Whoa.

103
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,371
I can't...

104
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,927
♪ I don't wanna go anymore ♪♪

105
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,201
Hey, wait up!

106
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,323
U.S.A.

107
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,209
U.S.A.

108
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,889
U.S.A. Whoa!

109
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,849
What is that?

110
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,320
What is that?

111
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,646
I know what that is.

112
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,524
What have you got?
Five dollar.

113
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,361
What?
I haven't even touched anything yet.

114
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,165
Okay?

115
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,728
How much is that?
Five dollar.

116
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,524
Ah...

117
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,960
My daughter.

118
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,571
She's gonna be 3 years old.

119
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,605
It's her birthday.

120
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,763
Give me 5 dollar.
Three years old.

121
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,811
Three years old.

122
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,291
Spec...
Give me 5 dollar.

123
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,568
You give me 5 dollar.

124
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,205
Mwah.

125
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,849
Oh...

126
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,690
No.

127
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,570
Stop it.

128
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,489
Hey.

129
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,603
Hey!

130
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,809
Chucky!

131
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,923
- Chucky!
- We're closed.

132
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,451
No! It's Joe!

133
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,201
Are you deaf? I said we're closed.

134
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,805
Joe! Open up.

135
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:02,205
Hey! Come on!
Give me one drink.

136
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,806
Come on. One...
Coffee.

137
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,604
No. Fuck coffee.

138
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,609
No, you promised.
You promised.

139
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,087
You promised.
You promised. Tell the duck.

140
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:15,530
I don't wanna tell the duck. Come back
tomorrow. You'll thank me in the morning.

141
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,886
No! No!

142
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,287
Fuck, no! Ah!

143
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,250
Goddamn it.

144
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,363
You don't wanna have fun!

145
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,325
Nobody wants to have fun anymore.

146
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,249
Goddamn it.

147
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,449
Hey.

148
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,121
What are you doing?

149
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,485
Hi.

150
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:45,250
Hey, I'm gonna take a piss,
all right?

151
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,611
Okay?

152
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,608
Oh. Sorry about the toilet.

153
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,564
I didn't mean...

154
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,650
Hello?

155
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,765
Hello?

156
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,444
Underwear.

157
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,847
What the hell is this?

158
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,167
Where the fuck is the phone?

159
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,450
Hello?

160
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,131
Can anybody hear me?

161
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,323
Hello?

162
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,443
Son of a bitch.

163
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,607
Hello?

164
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,842
Can anybody hear me
on the outside?

165
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,481
I'm stuck in a motel room.

166
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,806
Hello?

167
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,371
Fuck!

168
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,926
Hello?

169
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,441
Hey. Hey.

170
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,361
Tell me why I'm here. Tell... No, listen.

171
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,807
Tell me why I'm here. No, no, no.

172
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:38,244
Ah. Ow.

173
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,405
Dumplings. Anything but dumplings.

174
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,609
Please.

175
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,167
Please can I have something else
to eat?

176
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:39,045
Jesus H. Christ, God love you,

177
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,249
give me something
other than this crap.

178
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,362
<i>We're gonna squeeze for two</i>

179
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,848
<i>and then we're gonna open for two.
Make sure you resist it.</i>

180
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:53,726
<i>This is a great way to tone
and strengthen your upper legs.</i>

181
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,322
<i>And we all know that's an area
that often gets neglected.</i>

182
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:00,842
<i>So, if you haven't already,
join with me now.</i>

183
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,650
<i>And squeeze.</i>

184
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,406
<i>Come on, and up. Good.</i>

185
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,523
<i>Can you feel the burn?</i>
Yes.

186
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,046
<i>And release.</i>
Release.

187
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,366
<i>Here we go.</i>

188
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,800
<i>And...</i>
Squeeze.

189
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,047
<i>And release.</i>

190
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,766
<i>Let's go, keep going. Squeeze.</i>
Squeeze.

191
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,201
<i>And up. Ahh.</i>

192
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,885
Ahh.

193
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,520
<i>Ahh.</i>
Ahh.

194
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,086
<i>Now we're gonna speed it up.</i>

195
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,924
Oh, yeah.
<i>Ahh.</i>

196
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,526
Ahh. Ooh.
<i>Ahh.</i>

197
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,365
<i>Good. Feel it.</i>
I am.

198
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,962
<i>Ahh. Ahh.</i>
Ahh. Mm. Oh.

199
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,242
<i>Ahh. Ahh.</i>

200
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,323
<i>Good, and open.</i>

201
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:43,649
<i>Good, and squeeze. And...</i>

202
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,326
<i>Good. Squeeze.</i>

203
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,651
<i>And open.</i>

204
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,291
<i>Squeeze.</i>

205
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,970
<i>And open.</i>

206
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,611
<i>There she is.</i>

207
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,651
<i>I owe you one.</i>

208
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,241
<i>Early this morning, the body
of single mother Donna Hawthorne</i>

209
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,886
<i>was discovered
in her Southside apartment.</i>

210
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:42,688
<i>Police confirmed that she was raped
and savagely beaten to death.</i>

211
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:46,966
<i>The victim was the mother
of a 3-year-old girl</i>

212
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:50,403
<i>who was inside the apartment
at the time of the killing.</i>

213
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,401
<i>To quote forensic investigators:</i>

214
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,843
<i>The evidence is irrefutable.</i>

215
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:01,648
<i>Prime suspect Joseph Doucett
was the victim's former husband</i>

216
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:05,049
<i>and father of the surviving child.</i>

217
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:09,404
<i>That's all from Stephanie Lee, here
on the scene. Back to you, Michael.</i>

218
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,281
<i>Remember,</i>

219
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:33,326
<i>your enemy is most vulnerable
just before he strikes.</i>

220
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:45,051
<i>This area is extremely dangerous.
Don't let your guard down for a second.</i>

221
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,488
<i>They're everywhere.</i>

222
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,569
<i>This is really big.</i>

223
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,560
<i>We need to think about
what our next move will be.</i>

224
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,280
<i>We must figure out a plan
and execute it.</i>

225
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,290
<i>More importantly,
we need to get you two together.</i>

226
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:04,122
<i>- You have to speak with him.</i>
<i>- Unfortunately, it didn't work.</i>

227
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,604
<i>He's still alive.</i>

228
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,565
<i>We're going to have to try
something else.</i>

229
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,963
<i>I don't know. That seems risky.</i>

230
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:17,484
<i>If those two guys
are who we think they are...</i>

231
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,727
<i>I am sorry.</i>

232
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,530
<i>Six, seven, eight.</i>

233
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,361
<i>Up, down.
Let's take it down, down, slow.</i>

234
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,688
<i>Down, down, slow.</i>

235
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,245
<i>Down, down, slow.</i>

236
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,811
<i>Take it lower.</i>

237
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,280
<i>That's it, bring it up.</i>

238
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,408
<i>Down, down, slow.</i>

239
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,489
<i>Down, down, slow.</i>

240
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,889
<i>Arch your back. That's it.</i>

241
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,370
<i>That's it.</i>

242
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:44,882
<i>Recover before we get back into it.</i>

243
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:49,688
<i>I, William Jefferson Clinton,
do solemnly swear</i>

244
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,764
<i>I will faithfully execute
the office of president...</i>

245
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,843
Come on this way.

246
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,926
Mm. Mm, mm.

247
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,890
You're the king.

248
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,881
Don't ever leave me.

249
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,560
Don't ever leave me.

250
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,928
Oh, I won't touch your babies.

251
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,963
I won't touch your babies.

252
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,326
I'll keep you
nice and comfy here.

253
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,847
Yes, you protect those babies.

254
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,849
You protect those babies.

255
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,408
Where are you?

256
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,281
Where are you?

257
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,247
Aah! No!

258
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:51,603
No, no, no!

259
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,609
No!

260
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,365
I'm sorry.

261
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:59,086
I'm sorry.

No.

<i>July 30th, 1994.</i>

<i>Donna Hawthorne is brutally raped
and beaten to death</i>

270

<i>by her ex-husband, Joseph Doucett.</i>

00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,683
<i>It's an open-and-shut case,
but there's just one problem.</i>

272
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,611
<i>The killer has disappeared.</i>

273
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:41,282
<i>For five years
Joe Doucett has eluded justice.</i>

<i>I'm James Prestley.</i>

276

<i>Tonight, we examine
this mystery of crime.</i>

277

<i>What can you tell us about Mia?</i>

278
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:55,604
<i>We adopted Mia
shortly after the tragedy.</i>

279

<i>Neither her mother
or this Doucett murderer</i>

280
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,848
<i>had any living relatives</i>

281
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,646

Blessed.</i>

282
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,726
<i>Yeah.</i>

283
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:11,528
<i>We were blessed to have this angel
come into our lives.</i>

284
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:14,007
<i>- Does Mia know what happened?</i>
<i>- No.</i>

285
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:18,207
<i>I mean, she knows she's adopted
and that her real mother is gone</i>

286
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,731
<i>but no more than that.</i>

287
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:22,361
<i>We're waiting until she's older
to tell her.</i>

288
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:25,723

<i>"Dear daughter, dear Mia,</i>

293
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:04,364
I saw you on TV today.
You looked very pretty.

294
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:08,531
When you played your cello,
it was so beautiful.

295
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,050
I'm glad that you're happy.

296

00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,610
<i>And today, I pledge to fight
against the impulses</i>

Good.</i>

314
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:15,523

00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:08,166
<i>And once I'm free,
I will get these letters to you, somehow.</i>

353
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,725
<i>All I ask, Mia, is that you read them
before you judge me.</i>

354
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,291
<i>I beg you.</i>

355
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,244
<i>Please.</i>

356
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,125
<i>Your loving father."</i>

357
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,843
<i>Over 20 years on the air.</i>

358
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,804
<i>This season we look back</i>

359
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,924
<i>at the greatest mysteries of crime
in our history.</i>

360
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,201
<i>Tonight,</i>

361
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:10,847
<i>the murder of Donna Hawthorne.
Tell me about your mother.</i>

362
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,242
<i>I don't remember my mother,</i>

363
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,125
<i>but I know I loved her.</i>

364
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,682
<i>I know it in my heart
and my soul.</i>

365
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,166
<i>And your father?</i>

366
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,727
<i>I don't remember him, either.</i>

367
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:24,565
<i>I'm sorry, that's not what I was asking.</i>

368
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,529
<i>I hate him for what he did.</i>

369
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:31,281
<i>No, there's a part of me
that hates him for what he did</i>

370
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:34,689
<i>but there's another part
that wants to understand,</i>

371
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,849
<i>that wants to ask why.</i>

372
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:41,483
<i>Your father's
been missing for 20 years.</i>

373
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,449
<i>I don't know if you presume he's dead</i>

374
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:49,124
<i>but if I could somehow bring him here,
do you think you could forgive him?</i>

375
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,885
<i>Uh...</i>

376
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,761
<i>I could try.</i>

377
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:07,045
<i>Mia Roos is a beautiful
and very talented young woman</i>

378
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:11,842
<i>but what's most impressive about her
is her gentle and compassionate spirit.</i>

379
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:16,608
<i>I only hope that she's able to find
some kind of closure one day.</i>

380
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:21,203
<i>This mystery may remain unsolved,
but one thing is clear.</i>

381
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:24,165
<i>Justice always prevails.</i>

382
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,488
<i>I'm James Prestley.</i>

383
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,960
<i>God bless you.</i>

384
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,451
Hey.

385
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,444
Hey.

386
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,803
Hey, slow down a second.

387
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,690
Stop.

388
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,450
Get the fuck off of me!
Hey!

389
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,890
Leave the lady alone.

390
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,045
Leave her the fuck alone.

391
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:41,085
Stop! Stop! Wait!

392
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:47,607
Please! No! No!

393
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,331
No!

394
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:56,201
Stop! Stop!

395
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:59,721
Stop! Please!

396
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,806
Please!

397
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,248
Let him know I stopped by, all right?

398
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,449
Hey. Where is she?

399
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,726
Tell me where she is!

400
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,684
- Don't hurt me!
- Where is she?

401
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,166
Hey! Let him go!

402
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,050
Jesus, let go of him!

403
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,809
Jesus, Johnny, are you okay?

404
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:40,290
If you wanna see the doctor,
respect the rules, okay?

405
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,323
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

406
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,807
I thought he was someone else.
You okay?

407
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:48,487
Is everything all right?
Yeah, yeah, everything's fine.

408
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:52,844
That must be yours. Johnny takes things
that don't belong to him sometimes.

409
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:57,329
I'm really sorry about that. Hey, I'm
Dr. Tom Melby. I run the clinic.

410
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,681
I'm Joe Doakes.

411
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,611
Johnny, can we give
Mr. Doakes his umbrella back?

412
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,006
- Please?
- No.

413
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,282
You sure? No' he can keep it-

414
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:14,724
Sir? Uh, Joe? Um, uh...

415
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:19,044
Sorry. If you think that you might need
any medical help

416
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:22,210
or, you know, if you just...
If you just wanna talk to

417
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,681
someone, my name
is Marie Sebastian.

418
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,882
Please, take that.

419
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,564
We're closed!

420
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,521
Are you deaf?
I said, we're closed!

421
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,569
Chucky.

422
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:50,051
Do I know you?

423
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,447
It's Joe.

424
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,487
Joe?

425
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,124
Joe?

426
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,445
Come in.

427
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,209
<i>Twenty years in the same room?</i>

428
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,688
<i>Jesus Christ,
I would have lost my mind.</i>

429
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:22,283
Ahh. Why?

430
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:27,368
Why would somebody do that to you?
What could you have possibly done?

431
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:31,206
Here, I think you could use this.

432
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,445
No, I'm fine with coffee.
Well, what are you gonna do, Joe?

433
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,127
Hello?

434
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:53,887
<i>Hello, Joseph. How was
your first day of freedom?</i>

435
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,570
Who is this?
<i>"I believe</i>

436
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:59,162
<i>that we are solely responsible
for our choices,</i>

437
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,727
<i>and we have to accept
the consequences</i>

438
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:05,521
<i>of every deed, word and thought
throughout our lifetime. "</i>

439
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:09,522
That was written
by Elisabeth Kübler-Ross, Joseph.

440
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:14,487
And now, I want you to look at every

441
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,808
<i>deed, word and thought</i>

442
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:21,682
<i>in the course
of your miserable existence.</i>

443
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:24,684
<i>Heh. There's more coming.</i>

444
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,564
<i>A formal proposal</i>

445
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:31,971
<i>that if you are successful, Joseph,
I think you will find peace.</i>

446
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,640
<i>I believe you may even find happiness.</i>

447
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:39,283
<i>Perhaps with that lovely daughter
of yours, Mia.</i>

448
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,649
Mia has nothing to do with this.
<i>Anyway, I'll be in touch.</i>

449
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,368
Was that him? Let me see.

450
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:54,523
Blocked. What'd he say?

451
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,641
I need your help, Chucky.

452
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:04,083
Okay, Daniel Newcombe.

453
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,005
Probably gonna be a lot
of Daniel Newcombes.

454
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,965
He owned a bunch
of car dealerships.

455
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,521
Daniel Newcombe Fine Motor Cars.

456
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:13,727
Well...

457
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:17,327
"Local businessman killed
in mid-air collision."

458
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,602
We can take him off the list.

459
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,410
You know, if you
don't mind me saying,

460
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:25,121
that's a very long list.
I know.

461
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,725
Bernard Sharkey.
Yeah.

462
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,684
Advanced, uh...

463
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,441
Advanced Advertising.

464
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,404
"Never Say Die Senior Citizen Club."

465
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,761
- That's him?
- Yeah.

466
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,166
Why is he on the list?

467
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,966
Because he was my boss.
Is there an address?

468
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:41,248
Uh, yeah. This guy?
Okay.

469
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,528
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You can check him out.

470
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:47,247
What'd he do?
Oh, it's what I did, not what he did.

471
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,601
Save him.
Mm-hm.

472
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,280
What do you have to do?
Just write it in there?

473
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:55,604
Yeah. You write whatever you want in there
and then you hit enter. That's all.

474
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,723
I can do the rest.
No, I'm good.

475
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:00,531
No, why don't you go to sleep?
You sure?

476
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,530
Yeah.
All right.

477
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,650
Joe.

478
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,001
Got some coffee.

479
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,408
Joe! Joe!

480
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,204
Hey! Hey, man!

481
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,801
Come on.

482
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,327
Hey, man! Hey!

483
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,844
<i>911 operator, what's your emer...?</i>

484
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,526
He gonna be all right?

485
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:03,441
Yeah, he'll be fine. He just needs to rest.
Guy's exhausted.

486
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,841
He's also malnourished
and dehydrated.

487
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,050
What happened to him?

488
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:11,011
He showed up last night
completely out of the blue.

489
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:15,165
I haven't seen the guy in 20 years.
I didn't even recognize him at first.

490
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:20,524
Comes inside, we sit down,
he starts telling me this crazy story.

491
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,324
What's the story?

492
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:26,485
How do you know him?
I don't.

493
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,967
You don't.
Well, what's the story?

494
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:31,731
I said enough already.
I don't know who you are.

495
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,127
Come on, Chucky!

496
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,645
It's 9:00 already!
Shit.

497
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,330
Okay, I gotta open the joint.

498
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:40,850
Okay. I'm gonna stick around
and make sure he's all right for a while.

499
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,642
Hold your horses.

500
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:16,442
<i>Dear daughter, dear Mia,</i>

501
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:20,766
<i>I have been unjustly held in this
god-awful place for almost 20 years.</i>

502
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:24,487
<i>When I'm free of this place,
and I will be free of it,</i>

503
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,887
<i>my purpose will be simple and pure.</i>

504
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:29,367
<i>I intend to prove my love for you.</i>

505
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:32,000
<i>To do this,
I must find the man who put me here.</i>

506
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,247
<i>I am your father.</i>

507
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,771
<i>Now it is my duty,</i>

508
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,008
<i>now it is my responsibility</i>

509
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,446
<i>to take care of you.</i>

510
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:41,723
<i>To love you, Mia.
Please give me that chance.</i>

511
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:47,285
<i>The world can be a cold, ugly place,
and people can be cruel and deceitful.</i>

512
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,687
<i>But never let that change who you are.</i>

513
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:53,049
<i>One day I will be there
to share it with you.</i>

514
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:55,891
<i>Love, Daddy.</i>

515
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,765
You read them?

516
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,883
You read my letters?

517
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:03,003
You had no right!

518
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,043
Who the fuck are you?

519
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:07,846
Chucky called me
because you were in bad shape.

520
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:11,647
I'm all right now, you can get out.
No, you're far from all right.

521
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,649
What are you doing here?

522
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:16,885
I apologize for reading your letters.

523
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,525
You didn't call the police?

524
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,768
No, I didn't.
Why?

525
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:26,290
I believe you.
Why?

526
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:31,243
I believe that you've been
locked up for a long time.

527
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:35,407
Okay? I believe you want to be
a father to your daughter.

528
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:36,726
Don't touch me.

529
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:39,321
And that you want to
prove your love to her.

530
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:42,171
Okay.
I said, don't touch me.

531
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,683
Unh! Okay.

532
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,247
What if I thought
you knew too much, huh?

533
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:49,562
Reading my letters.

534
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:53,647
What if I felt like
I needed to kill you right now?

535
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,851
Then I suppose I'd be dead.

536
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:01,085
Joe,

537
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:05,001
please take your hands off me.

538
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,167
If you are trying
to find your daughter

539
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:22,127
and clear your name, I could help you.
Or let me take you to people who can.

540
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:25,847
There are social workers,
legal aid, even oops I trust.

541
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,201
No, I don't need your help.

542
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,206
Bernard Sharkey.

543
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:40,404
Oh. Bernard. He's up the stairs.
It's nice of y'all to come.

544
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,364
He doesn't get many visitors.

545
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,450
Thank you.
Bye. Enjoy.

546
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,762
Sorry, boss.

547
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:15,522
How do you know that's not him?
He seems happy.

548
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:19,049
The one who called me doesn't know
what happy means.

549
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:27,411
What?
I need Yellow Pages.

550
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:30,206
Where are all the payphones?
No. Okay. Hold on.

551
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:32,488
What are you looking for?
A restaurant.

552
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:35,211
Okay.
It's called Dragon something.

553
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,249
There. Here.

554
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:47,367
Five dollar.

555
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:51,849
Sir, buy something
for your girlfriend. Only $5.

556
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:54,042
Buy anything, $5.

557
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:28,203
Ugh.

558
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:40,731
I have to go. I have a shift,
I can't just not show up.

559
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,530
I put my number in your phone.

560
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,007
I'll be free all day tomorrow.
Thank you.

561
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:36,050
The usual, sir?
Yep. Thank you.

562
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,848
- Yeah.
- Put it on the bill.

563
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:41,327
Have a good day.
See you tomorrow.

564
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,968
Where's my next order?

565
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:07,240
Sir. Excuse me, sir. Sir!

566
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:33,166
Hey.

567
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:58,571
You know the drill.
Put it on the table.

568
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:02,089
Thirty-nine across.
"Alter ego of Edmond Dantès."

569
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:04,845
The Count of Monte Cristo.

570
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:20,484
Hello. It's time to feed the pets.

571
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:23,684
<i>F-O-O-D. F-O-O-D.</i>

572
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:26,845
Goddamn,
these motherfuckers don't do shit.

573
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:29,930
Hey, what's up with the...? Unh!

574
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:34,523
Let me up out of here, motherfucker. Me
and you, man-to-man. Come on. Let's go.

575
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:36,046
Shit.

576
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:38,447
You want some get back,
then let me get up.

577
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:41,490
Me and you can go at it, motherfucker.
How about it?

578
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:42,727
Hold still.

579
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:45,329
What the fuck are you doing?

580
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:47,609
What the fuck are you doing?

581
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:50,611
What the fuck are you doing?
Shut the fuck up.

582
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:53,282
There we go.

583
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,161
Are you ready?

584
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:59,762
Might wanna think about
what you're doing.

585
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:03,045
I've been thinking about it
for the last 20 years.

586
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:04,567
Wait. What...?

587
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:06,324
Hold still.
Cocksucker.

588
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:11,646
Ow! Ow! Motherfucker. Ow!

589
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:13,526
Shit.

590
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:17,685
Heh, heh.
You no dick, ass-licking son of a bitch!

591
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:19,928
Fuck you.
No, fuck you.

592
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:24,040
Oh! You booger-eating,
piss-drinking motherfucker.

593
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:28,811
If you stop now,
you may get out of here alive.

594
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:32,882
I'm gonna keep going

595
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:36,323
till I can pull your head off
with my bare hands.

596
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:37,760
Okay?

597
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:40,611
Listen to me. Listen to me.

598
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:43,531
I only run this place, all right?

599
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:46,166
I was hired to keep you here.

600
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:47,407
Who hired you?

601
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:50,806
I can't tell you that.
Then do me a favor

602
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:52,121
and shut the fuck up.

603
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:13,920
Who hired you?

604
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:17,408
I don't know his fucking name!

605
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:20,406
Who hired you?
No, no, no.

606
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:23,289
I swear. I swear it's the truth.

607
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:26,450
It's the truth. I never ask their names.

608
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:29,081
They never tell.

609
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:37,287
Oh, goddamn you, motherfucker!

610
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:41,688
God...! Oh, goddamn!

611
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:46,841
Oh, no. Oh, please. Please.

612
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:54,523
I know you're gonna tell me something.
I don't know shit.

613
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:58,520
I swear before God and eight
motherfucking white people, all right?

614
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:01,200
Look. Look.
No, no, no.

615
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:03,880
No, no, no.

616
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:05,849
The tapes. The tapes.
Where?

617
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:08,526
Over there in the cabinet.
Go, look.

618
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:13,450
First one. Right there.
Go look. Right there.

619
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:15,449
Right there, right there.

620
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:17,369
First cabinet.

621
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:20,086
Second shelf, third tray, first cassette.

622
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:24,170
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That one. That one.

623
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:25,964
"Tape one. Doucett."

624
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:29,323
Go ahead, play it. Listen to it.

625
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:35,481
I don't know who he is.
I never get names.

626
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:37,330
I swear.

627
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:40,403
<i>Sir, for a very long time,</i>

628
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:43,325
<i>we have served
a very elite group of clients.</i>

629
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:46,683
<i>Now, I surmise that you've encountered
one such individual.</i>

630
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:49,247
<i>That's the only way
you received this number.</i>

631
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:50,801
<i>Correct.</i>

632
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:56,444
Sir, this business existed
long before my tenure

633
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:59,530
and will continue long after I'm gone.

634
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:03,726
<i>Never has a released guest
made its existence known</i>

635
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:05,450
<i>to the outside world.</i>

636
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:07,603
- You've convinced me.
<i>- Good.</i>

637
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:09,768
How long will we have the pleasure

638
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:13,726
of entertaining this Mr. Doucett
as a guest?

639
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:15,285
<i>Twenty years.</i>

640
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:30,727
Get your asses up here now.

641
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,051
Open the door!

642
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:39,810
- See?
- Chaney!

643
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,126
I told you.

644
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:42,606
Well, do we?

645
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:45,764
- You tell those motherfuckers...
- Tell them what?

646
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:49,447
Aah! Get the fuck away from the door!

647
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:51,330
Move away from the fucking door!

648
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:54,610
You hear me say get away?
Get away from the door.

649
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,370
Back the fuck up! Back up!

650
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:58,164
All right!

651
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:00,562
Easy. Easy now. Back up!

652
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:03,889
Easy. Easy.

653
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:06,560
You're not gonna get away
with this, Joe.

654
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:10,207
Back up.
Easy. Easy. Easy, Joe.

655
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:12,528
Now!
Get him!

656
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:17,241
- Get his ass! He killed Marco?
- Yeah, yeah, they killed Marco.

657
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:50,687
Son of a bitch.

658
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:00,891
Fuck!

659
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:08,523
Oh, my God.

660
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:11,161
You must take care of yourself.

661
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:13,124
The fun is only just beginning.

662
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:24,165
Joe.

663
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:25,686
What the fuck happened?

664
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:27,086
Come on.

665
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:28,560
Come on, Joe.

666
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:47,527
Hello?

667
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:55,686
Marie, he needs to stay
down for at least a week.

668
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:59,726
Keep movement to a minimum because
we don't wanna tear out those sutures.

669
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:03,845
He lost a lot of blood, but if he
stays down, he should be all right.

670
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,651
Half a centimeter difference
on some lacerations,

671
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:08,848
it could've been a different story.

672
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:11,328
I really appreciate this, Tom.

673
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:14,000
You should let me take him
to the hospital.

674
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:16,362
Why not? Well, you can't.

675
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:23,244
Somebody tried to kill him. Isn't that
something we should call the police over?

676
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:25,482
Well, I'm asking you not to.

677
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:29,287
He isn't a stray dog or a
bird with a broken wing, Marie.

678
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:31,608
I know that you love your lost causes

679
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:37,361
but sometimes we meet people who can
get us to engage in old thinking.

680
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:41,326
So, what, you think I'm using again?
Is that what you think?

681
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:44,250
Fuck you.

682
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:04,404
Come in.

683
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:10,166
Hey. Just wanted to see
if you were feeling all right.

684
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:20,801
I just wanna take a look at that wound on
your back really quickly, if that's okay.

685
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,445
Just turn around here.

686
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:24,608
Unh.
Sorry.

687
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:26,446
Okay.

688
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:31,528
Well, it looks like the bleeding
has stopped, so that's a good sign.

689
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:38,248
I can't tell you what to do.
And I can't tell Marie either.

690
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:42,289
But I can tell you this.
She's been through a lot.

691
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:46,690
And if there's one thing that she
doesn't need any more of from anyone,

692
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:48,370
it's pain.

693
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:51,761
Please don't hurt her.

694
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:02,803
He likes you.

695
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:08,727
Do you like him?

696
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:14,765
Uh, no.
That was a long time ago.

697
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:19,006
Well, he still likes you.

698
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:22,845
I got your suit cleaned for you.

699
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:29,403
They didn't, um...
They didn't patch up the hole.

700
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:36,210
Can I help you? Here.

701
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:55,683
Well, I think you should go.

702
00:59:56,320 --> 00:59:58,402
Come on, go.

703
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:03,929
Come on, get out of here.

704
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:06,210
Go.
Are you serious?

705
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:09,324
Don't come back. Go.

706
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:11,170
Come on, go.

707
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:20,408
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
last call for alcohol.

708
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:24,890
Speak up or
forever hold your peace.

709
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:32,730
Hello?

710
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:35,165
Hello.

711
01:00:57,120 --> 01:01:00,567
Hello. I thought it was time we met.

712
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:04,326
Aah! Hey!

713
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:07,884
Hey! What the...?

714
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:10,447
Cool. Be cool.
All right, all right.

715
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:15,206
Kill me now

716
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:19,844
and die seconds later
never knowing why.

717
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:24,886
Stop it!

718
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:29,007
I have your daughter.
If you'd like to see her alive again,

719
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:31,811
I hope we can continue
without the violence.

720
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:36,483
May I see your list?

721
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:45,930
No.

722
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:49,964
It's of no use to you, trust me.

723
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:52,886
I have a proposition
for you, Joseph.

724
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:57,405
If you should accept and succeed,
you will be greatly rewarded.

725
01:01:57,600 --> 01:02:01,321
Firstly, with a video tape
recording

726
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:04,444
of the rape and murder
of your wife,

727
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:06,768
Donna Hawthorne.
<i>No! No!</i>

728
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:08,325
Oh, God, no.

729
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:12,368
- No. I don't wanna watch it.
<i>- No!</i>

730
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:14,449
<i>Please.</i>
Turn it off.

731
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:18,087
<i>Say goodbye. Say goodbye.</i>

732
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:22,691
- Turn it off. Turn it off.
- Very well.

733
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:30,127
Secondly,
my handwritten confession

734
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:35,691
to that crime and
your kidnapping and imprisonment.

735
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:40,922
Thirdly, and this
is my favorite one,

736
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:44,609
20 million dollars in diamonds.

737
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:51,567
Lastly, and again,
this is only if you should succeed,

738
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:55,931
I will put a bullet through my brain,

739
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:58,367
and you can watch.

740
01:02:58,560 --> 01:03:00,801
Answer two questions.

741
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:05,770
One, who am I?

742
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:11,729
And two,
why did I imprison you for 20 years?

743
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:16,290
If you provide satisfactory answers
to both of these questions

744
01:03:16,520 --> 01:03:21,924
in little more than 46 hours
from now, you win.

745
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:26,807
Refusal of the challenge
brings the same result as failure.

746
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,287
You stay a fugitive from justice,

747
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:33,326
you get no reward, no closure,

748
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:36,444
and I kill your daughter.

749
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:39,331
If you or anyone you know
should go to the police

750
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:42,723
or try to warn Mia,
the consequences will be severe.

751
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:47,482
Especially for her. If you doubt
the extent of my will or my reach,

752
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:51,002
I suggest you look in
on your friend Marie.

753
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:57,244
That is a live broadcast.
My proposition, yes or no?

754
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:01,167
Yes.

755
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:05,160
It's 629 Cooper
Street, and you'd better hurry.

756
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:18,250
Marie.

757
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:21,123
Marie. Marie.

758
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:26,970
Hey, Joe.

759
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:33,650
I was gonna let Cortez here
have some fun with her.

760
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:36,320
But now that you're here,

761
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:38,927
the bitch can wait.

762
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:43,041
- Let's get him up on the table.
- Come on.

763
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:46,130
Let's go. Let's go.

764
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:48,727
Pull him up.

765
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:58,605
The last person
that got the better of me,

766
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:03,604
I tracked her funky ass down

767
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:08,044
and tortured her for 16 fucking days.

768
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:11,449
Now, compared
to what I'm about to do to you,

769
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:14,962
that was like an ant
fucking an elephant.

770
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:30,405
Yes?

771
01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:32,969
I'm afraid I can't do that.

772
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:35,925
Reparations must be made.

773
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:39,206
Indeed it was you
who gave me this address

774
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:41,164
and I appreciate that, but...

775
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:47,407
No. No, there's nothing you can
give me that will stop me...

776
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:50,331
"Go to the door."

777
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:04,611
- Cortez.
- Yo.

778
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:06,484
Cortez.

779
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:09,285
Move.

780
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:16,562
Oh, well, maybe I <i>can...</i>

781
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:20,523
I thank you for your generosity, sir.
Damn.

782
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:24,486
And thank you
for appreciating my sacrifice.

783
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:28,522
Yes, sir. You have a good evening too.

784
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:34,204
You are a lucky motherfucker,
you know that?

785
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:37,686
Let's go.

786
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:52,125
I'm sorry.

787
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:56,888
I'm sorry.

788
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:00,884
Hey. Hey. Hey.

789
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:03,646
It's okay. It's okay.

790
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:08,364
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

791
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:11,482
I have a friend downtown,
so I can, um...

792
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:15,043
I can stay with her.
I don't feel safe here anymore.

793
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:25,529
Hello?

794
01:08:28,040 --> 01:08:31,362
Every time he calls,
the same music plays.

795
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:49,126
Uh, Evergreen Academy.

796
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:51,922
Have you ever heard of that?

797
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,570
The prep school I went to.

798
01:09:00,160 --> 01:09:03,084
This is so weird, I can't find anything.

799
01:09:05,280 --> 01:09:07,123
Here's something.

800
01:09:07,480 --> 01:09:08,720
Who's Edwina Burke?

801
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:14,003
She was the headmistress.
She might know something.

802
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:32,328
I used to drink a lot.

803
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:38,125
Yeah, well, I used to drink, and I also
did a shitload of other stuff, but...

804
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:44,526
Tonight was actually... It was the first
time that I wanted to use again.

805
01:09:48,280 --> 01:09:50,487
I'm glad you're here.

806
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:22,609
Uh, Miss Burke? Edwina Burke
from Evergreen Academy?

807
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:26,050
Yes.
I was wondering if I could talk to you

808
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:28,965
about a former student?
Joe Doucett.

809
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:32,921
- Come in.
<i>- I hope I'm not disturbing you.</i>

810
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:37,370
<i>Not at all. I was just
making some tea. Please, sit.</i>

811
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:44,844
Joseph Doucett.

812
01:10:45,080 --> 01:10:49,051
Do you remember him?
Of course.

813
01:10:49,240 --> 01:10:54,406
We had many students gain notoriety,
but he was our only murderer.

814
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:58,008
Thank God.
Well, what if I told you

815
01:10:58,200 --> 01:11:01,966
that Joe Doucett is innocent
and another man killed his wife?

816
01:11:02,160 --> 01:11:04,401
Someone he knew at Evergreen.

817
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:06,967
Why don't you tell me
who you are?

818
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:10,848
I'm sorry.
My name's Marie Sebastian.

819
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:13,805
Have you heard
of the Innocence Project?

820
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:18,329
The Innocence Project
works with convicted felons.

821
01:11:18,520 --> 01:11:21,410
Joseph disappeared 20 years ago.

822
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:24,923
Excuse me.

823
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:47,243
You really think
he didn't do it?

824
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:50,683
We have evidence
that suggests he was framed.

825
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:54,405
That comes as some relief.

826
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:57,126
He was a very handsome boy.

827
01:11:57,320 --> 01:12:00,688
Terrible student,
but Donna adored him

828
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:03,207
but he never appreciated that or her.

829
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:06,802
He was the kind of boy who
thought very highly of himself

830
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,206
and no one else.

831
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:12,366
In fact, he could be quite cruel
to the others.

832
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:15,086
Always with a grin, as if it were a joke.

833
01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:20,522
I always felt he was a bit of a lost soul.

834
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:25,848
You said you thought
it might be another student?

835
01:12:26,040 --> 01:12:29,249
- I'm assuming Joe had enemies?
- Many.

836
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:32,047
But for one to do something so horrible?

837
01:12:32,240 --> 01:12:35,483
That would require
a very deep level of hatred.

838
01:12:35,680 --> 01:12:37,967
Well, was there someone?

839
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:41,127
Anyone like that?

840
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:43,683
I honestly don't remember.

841
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:48,046
I drove by the academy
this morning.

842
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:49,800
What happened?

843
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:51,286
They took it from him.

844
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:54,211
My father built it brick by brick.

845
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:57,768
The board of directors sold it
to some faceless corporation

846
01:12:57,960 --> 01:13:01,123
and the gates have been locked
ever since.

847
01:13:01,320 --> 01:13:02,526
It's all still there.

848
01:13:02,720 --> 01:13:06,645
Files, records,
the entire history of the school,

849
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:08,326
abandoned.

850
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:12,520
Bye.
Marie.

851
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:17,521
When you first arrived, you said
you believe Joe is innocent

852
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:19,245
not was.

853
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:21,130
I assumed he was dead.

854
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:27,249
Thank you.

855
01:13:35,720 --> 01:13:38,610
God, you went to school here?

856
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:40,040
A long time ago.

857
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:46,001
Let's come back tonight.
Okay.

858
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:23,807
Hello?
I didn't know him back then.

859
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,809
I don't even recognize the name.

860
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:27,968
Your friends?
Maybe they know him.

861
01:14:28,160 --> 01:14:31,801
I haven't seen those assholes
in years. I doubt they'd talk to me.

862
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,924
I hated everything about
that fucking place, except you.

863
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:38,249
<i>I'm sorry, Joe.</i>
No, there's nothing to be sorry about.

864
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:40,442
Let me see what I can find out.
Okay?

865
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:41,687
All right.

866
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:53,729
We should change your bandage.

867
01:14:57,240 --> 01:15:00,084
Need help?
Yeah, please.

868
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:25,124
Sister?

869
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:33,563
<i>The party you have
called is not available. Leave a message.</i>

870
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:37,083
<i>Joe, it's Chucky. Call
me as soon as you get this.</i>

871
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:41,205
<i>It's not about him, it's about her.
The whore, remember?</i>

872
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:43,562
<i>Jesus, Joe, call me.</i>

873
01:16:49,160 --> 01:16:50,321
Chucky?

874
01:16:51,680 --> 01:16:52,806
Chucky?

875
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:07,209
You called her a whore.

876
01:17:08,280 --> 01:17:09,691
You called her a whore!

877
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:14,930
Whore! Whore! Whore!

878
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:05,727
Adrian Pryce.
Adrian Pryce.

879
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:07,649
I got it.

880
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:15,525
"As we begin our preparation
for the new year, I'd like to call attention

881
01:18:15,680 --> 01:18:20,641
to the arrival of a new legacy student
from the Pryce family, Amanda Pryce."

882
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:22,689
Will you check for Amanda?

883
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:24,524
Nineteen eighty-six.

884
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:27,444
I got it.

885
01:18:28,720 --> 01:18:31,644
Amanda Pryce.
"It has come to my attention

886
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:34,969
that the Pryce family
is relocating to Luxembourg."

887
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:42,601
Do you remember her?

888
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:50,045
Now, hold on.

889
01:18:50,240 --> 01:18:53,369
Freshwomen should be in their rooms.
This is a serious infraction.

890
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:56,444
Give it back to me.
Hey, Joe, leave her alone.

891
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:59,211
If she wants to go, let her go.
Donna, shut up.

892
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:02,609
This is sexy. Very sexy.
Huh, Chucky?

893
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:05,047
Give it back to me.
Aw. What a fucking freak.

894
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:08,569
Here, douche bag. GIRL 1: Disgusting.

895
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:10,486
- Hey.
- Come on.

896
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:13,320
Joe, let her through.

897
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,241
What dorm number are you in?

898
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:21,723
- Come on, let her go.
- Aw...

899
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:26,485
- Really?
- That bitch.

900
01:19:26,680 --> 01:19:28,045
Chucky, shut the fuck up.

901
01:19:28,280 --> 01:19:30,160
You gonna let her talk to me like that?

902
01:19:30,280 --> 01:19:31,440
I don't care, I'm drunk.

903
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:43,047
Now, let's get back.

904
01:20:44,440 --> 01:20:45,726
I can't be missed.

905
01:21:07,720 --> 01:21:09,643
Here you go.

906
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:17,646
There. "Family Tragedy
in Luxembourg."

907
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:20,411
<i>We are in the midst
of a most unpleasant mess.</i>

908
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:23,644
<i>The crime scene indicates
a double murder, suicide,</i>

909
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:26,491
<i>and one
seriously injured young man.</i>

910
01:21:26,680 --> 01:21:29,411
<i>The names cannot be released
at this time</i>

911
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:31,967
<i>awaiting the family identification.</i>

912
01:21:40,200 --> 01:21:43,010
"Son Tells Tale of Murder."

913
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:46,443
That's him. The man in
the greenhouse that night.

914
01:21:47,720 --> 01:21:49,404
He was her father.

915
01:22:04,360 --> 01:22:09,002
Chucky, where are you? Call me.

916
01:22:32,840 --> 01:22:35,889
Shh. Shh, Shh, Shh.

917
01:22:49,480 --> 01:22:52,404
If he kills you, you're not
gonna see your daughter.

918
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:54,125
Okay? And if you kill him,

919
01:22:54,360 --> 01:22:57,489
you're still not going to
see your daughter.

920
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:02,002
Just don't go.

921
01:23:03,880 --> 01:23:05,166
I don't have a choice.

922
01:23:06,240 --> 01:23:08,129
Please.

923
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:12,448
I don't want you to go.

924
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:16,324
Listen to me.

925
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:20,490
You promise me
you'll stay in this room.

926
01:23:21,640 --> 01:23:23,085
Hey.

927
01:23:23,280 --> 01:23:25,203
Don't call anyone,

928
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:27,767
don't talk to anyone.

929
01:23:38,560 --> 01:23:40,164
You stay.

930
01:23:44,120 --> 01:23:46,202
Will you promise?

931
01:23:47,800 --> 01:23:49,484
Yes.

932
01:24:11,040 --> 01:24:14,249
<i>This is Dr. Tom Melby.</i>
Listen carefully to what I tell you.

933
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:17,768
<i>Is Marie okay?</i>
Write this down, you'll need directions.

934
01:24:23,040 --> 01:24:25,566
I'm ready. Tell me where to go.

935
01:24:45,040 --> 01:24:46,690
Where's Mia?

936
01:25:15,680 --> 01:25:16,727
Where's Mia?

937
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:24,290
There.

938
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:29,247
Where? Where is she?

939
01:25:30,720 --> 01:25:32,324
Here.

940
01:25:33,160 --> 01:25:36,528
Quite close by, actually.

941
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:40,768
But you will not see her,

942
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:44,521
you will not save her
until I have your answers.

943
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:48,851
Please put that away. She will
suffer great pain if you do not.

944
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:54,849
Your reward.

945
01:25:55,360 --> 01:25:58,170
As I said, I'm a man of my word.

946
01:25:59,040 --> 01:26:00,724
So who am I?

947
01:26:01,080 --> 01:26:02,844
Adrian Doyle Pryce.

948
01:26:03,560 --> 01:26:06,040
Why did I imprison you
for 20 years?

949
01:26:06,240 --> 01:26:09,084
You blame me for what happened.
Elaborate.

950
01:26:09,280 --> 01:26:14,320
I saw your sister with a man,
down at the greenhouse.

951
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:18,007
"They were fucking.
They were fucking."

952
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:22,408
Isn't that what you told everyone?
Yes.

953
01:26:23,320 --> 01:26:25,322
I told Donna.

954
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:28,161
I told Chucky,
I told half of Evergreen.

955
01:26:30,280 --> 01:26:32,487
Gossip spreads like the plague.

956
01:26:32,680 --> 01:26:35,763
Amanda's a whore! Whore! Whore!
Stop it!

957
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:39,766
Whore! Whore! Whore!
Leave me alone!

958
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,526
- Chucky! Stop it now!
- Whore! Whore! Whore!

959
01:26:42,720 --> 01:26:45,166
Chucky! Stop it now!
I didn't do anything!

960
01:26:45,520 --> 01:26:49,684
You have no idea how difficult it was
for Amanda then.

961
01:26:49,880 --> 01:26:54,044
The torture that she endured,
all because of you.

962
01:26:55,640 --> 01:26:56,766
Continue.

963
01:26:56,960 --> 01:26:59,645
I didn't know it was your father
until today.

964
01:27:00,640 --> 01:27:04,201
The school must have found out
what was going on,

965
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:08,325
and he got your family out of
the States as fast as possible.

966
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:12,569
I'm only guessing,
but running didn't help.

967
01:27:12,760 --> 01:27:14,922
He must've been afraid
of what was coming.

968
01:27:15,120 --> 01:27:18,124
You know nothing of my father.

969
01:27:18,680 --> 01:27:21,126
He knew no fear, only love.

970
01:27:21,480 --> 01:27:23,562
Arthur Pryce was a great man.

971
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,367
He will always be a great man.

972
01:27:29,080 --> 01:27:31,082
What we had together...

973
01:27:32,680 --> 01:27:36,287
was beautiful and special and pure.

974
01:27:38,160 --> 01:27:42,722
<i>My father did what he did
to honor and preserve that.</i>

975
01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:45,764
Father.

976
01:28:45,720 --> 01:28:47,563
Father.

977
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:05,286
Daddy.

978
01:29:05,520 --> 01:29:07,409
<i>My father loved my mother.</i>

979
01:29:07,560 --> 01:29:09,483
Daddy.

980
01:29:11,400 --> 01:29:14,483
<i>He loved my sister.</i>

981
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:19,845
<i>And he loved me.</i>

982
01:29:20,080 --> 01:29:24,483
You see, Joseph,
my sister Amanda and I thought

983
01:29:24,640 --> 01:29:27,564
that what we had with my father
would last forever.

984
01:29:30,120 --> 01:29:32,885
That nobody could take it from us.

985
01:29:33,040 --> 01:29:34,371
And yet, you did.

986
01:29:34,840 --> 01:29:36,524
And, yes,

987
01:29:37,520 --> 01:29:41,047
that is why I imprisoned you
for 20 years.

988
01:29:47,240 --> 01:29:49,527
It seems you've won, Mr. Doucett.

989
01:29:50,120 --> 01:29:51,485
Take me to Mia.

990
01:29:51,680 --> 01:29:54,206
Yes, of course.

991
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:15,800
Do you know what I find
fascinating, Joseph?

992
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:19,368
All this time,
you never stopped to ask

993
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:23,206
the most fundamental question
of all.

994
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:28,843
Why did I let you go?

995
01:30:55,840 --> 01:30:58,320
Mind your head.

996
01:31:11,600 --> 01:31:16,447
Introducing one of the
longest-running shows on television

997
01:31:16,640 --> 01:31:19,849
but it had only a single viewer.

998
01:31:21,560 --> 01:31:23,244
You.

999
01:31:47,560 --> 01:31:51,087
<i>We adopted Mia
shortly after the tragedy.</i>

1000
01:31:51,280 --> 01:31:54,409
<i>Neither her mother
or this Doucett murderer</i>

1001
01:31:54,560 --> 01:31:56,847
<i>had any living relatives.</i>

1002
01:31:57,040 --> 01:32:00,249
<i>So we were lucky enough to...
Blessed.</i>

1003
01:32:01,240 --> 01:32:02,480
<i>Yes, we were blessed.</i>

1004
01:32:32,560 --> 01:32:33,971
Isn't it amazing?

1005
01:32:34,160 --> 01:32:37,846
People just believe whatever
they see on television.

1006
01:32:41,400 --> 01:32:43,687
Thank you, Ashley.
You can go.

1007
01:32:49,360 --> 01:32:50,850
What...?

1008
01:32:52,040 --> 01:32:56,921
- Joseph. Ha-ha-ha.
- No. No. Mia.

1009
01:32:57,840 --> 01:32:59,410
Mia!

1010
01:32:59,800 --> 01:33:01,689
Mia!

1011
01:33:01,880 --> 01:33:03,689
Oh, Joseph.

1012
01:33:03,880 --> 01:33:07,601
Joseph, that is not
your daughter.

1013
01:33:07,800 --> 01:33:12,681
Ashley is a musician
and very well paid actress

1014
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:18,011
that I've had in my employ since
she was 10 years old. Ha-ha-ha.

1015
01:33:18,200 --> 01:33:20,407
Oh, goodness.

1016
01:33:23,280 --> 01:33:24,566
Enough with the games.

1017
01:33:24,760 --> 01:33:26,842
You tell me where she is.
You tell me.

1018
01:33:27,480 --> 01:33:32,042
Answer the question
you never asked.

1019
01:33:33,040 --> 01:33:35,611
Why did I let you go?

1020
01:33:38,240 --> 01:33:41,767
You tell me. You tell me.

1021
01:33:44,280 --> 01:33:46,851
You know the answer, Joseph.

1022
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:51,925
In your heart of hearts,
you know

1023
01:33:52,120 --> 01:33:54,964
the plain and simple truth.

1024
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:06,847
<i>- Mia. Mia.</i>
- It took a while...

1025
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:11,244
<i>Mia. Where are you going?</i>
To change her name...

1026
01:34:11,840 --> 01:34:14,127
her records...

1027
01:34:16,760 --> 01:34:19,889
to find the right parents.

1028
01:34:21,280 --> 01:34:24,250
An insensitive mother,

1029
01:34:25,200 --> 01:34:30,286
a loving father
taken from her too soon.

1030
01:34:30,480 --> 01:34:34,804
It took 20 years to create her.

1031
01:34:35,560 --> 01:34:38,723
A sensitive, caring woman,

1032
01:34:38,920 --> 01:34:41,321
eager to help those in need

1033
01:34:41,480 --> 01:34:45,883
because she herself had overcome

1034
01:34:46,040 --> 01:34:49,283
such a troubled past.

1035
01:34:49,720 --> 01:34:54,009
The kind of woman
who couldn't help

1036
01:34:54,200 --> 01:34:59,240
but fall in love
with a man like you...

1037
01:34:59,880 --> 01:35:03,282
Joseph Doucett.

1038
01:35:09,680 --> 01:35:11,250
No!

1039
01:35:11,440 --> 01:35:14,762
No, no, no! God!

1040
01:35:14,960 --> 01:35:18,089
No, God, no, please, no!

1041
01:35:23,920 --> 01:35:25,490
Please, God, no!

1042
01:35:30,440 --> 01:35:35,162
- Joe? Joe?
- No way, no way, no!

1043
01:35:35,320 --> 01:35:36,810
Aah. No.

1044
01:35:37,040 --> 01:35:39,441
No, no, no.

1045
01:35:39,640 --> 01:35:43,565
No, no, no.
You can't hurt her.

1046
01:35:43,960 --> 01:35:45,086
Who is this?

1047
01:35:45,280 --> 01:35:47,760
Leave her out of it, please. Please.

1048
01:35:47,960 --> 01:35:50,725
Who is this?
Please, please, please.

1049
01:35:50,920 --> 01:35:52,206
No, don't hurt her.

1050
01:35:52,520 --> 01:35:54,648
Hurt me. Hurt me.

1051
01:35:57,160 --> 01:35:58,764
Kill me. Yes, yes, yes.

1052
01:35:58,960 --> 01:36:01,281
Yes. Kill me. Please.
Shh.

1053
01:36:01,880 --> 01:36:06,408
Shh. I don't want to kill you, Joseph.
Please kill me.

1054
01:36:06,600 --> 01:36:09,888
This is why I let you go.

1055
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:11,881
Shh.

1056
01:36:14,200 --> 01:36:19,650
So that I could experience
this moment with you.

1057
01:36:20,720 --> 01:36:24,691
So that you could
truly understand what I had,

1058
01:36:24,920 --> 01:36:28,447
and what you took from me.

1059
01:36:45,240 --> 01:36:47,925
Heaven make me free of it.

1060
01:36:48,120 --> 01:36:51,442
The rest is silence.

1061
01:37:15,680 --> 01:37:19,924
<i>"Dear Marie, you
will never see me again.</i>

1062
01:37:24,560 --> 01:37:26,562
<i>I'm gone from your life forever.</i>

1063
01:37:28,400 --> 01:37:30,971
<i>I have done something terrible.</i>

1064
01:37:31,880 --> 01:37:33,848
<i>Something unforgivable.</i>

1065
01:37:34,760 --> 01:37:36,683
<i>And for it, I must be punished.</i>

1066
01:37:38,680 --> 01:37:41,251
<i>For a short while, I was happy...</i>

1067
01:37:42,840 --> 01:37:44,808
<i>because of you.</i>

1068
01:37:45,720 --> 01:37:48,451
<i>And I will cherish
that happiness forever.</i>

1069
01:37:50,480 --> 01:37:52,926
<i>Marie, I will love you, always.</i>

1070
01:37:55,960 --> 01:37:58,247
<i>But you must forget me.</i>

1071
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:13,925
<i>Do not waste one more moment
of your life thinking about me.</i>

1072
01:38:14,760 --> 01:38:18,003
<i>I want you to be with someone
who will care for you,</i>

1073
01:38:18,240 --> 01:38:21,323
<i>watch over you, bring you joy,</i>

1074
01:38:21,520 --> 01:38:23,522
<i>not pain.</i>

1075
01:38:27,320 --> 01:38:31,928
<i>I want you to find happiness
with a good man</i>

1076
01:38:32,520 --> 01:38:34,124
<i>who has a good heart.</i>

1077
01:38:36,840 --> 01:38:38,330
<i>A man unlike me.</i>

1078
01:38:40,800 --> 01:38:42,768
<i>Goodbye.</i>

1079
01:38:44,280 --> 01:38:46,328
<i>Joe."</i>
