1
00:00:38,989 --> 00:00:41,116
Yes, Marlin.

2
00:00:41,158 --> 00:00:43,251
No, I see it. It's beautiful.

3
00:00:43,294 --> 00:00:45,819
So, Coral, when you said
you wanted an ocean view...

4
00:00:45,863 --> 00:00:50,027
you didn't think you'd get
the whole ocean, did you?

5
00:00:50,067 --> 00:00:54,868
Oh, yeah.
A fish can breathe out here.

6
00:00:54,905 --> 00:00:56,839
Did your man deliver,
or did he deliver?

7
00:00:56,874 --> 00:00:59,172
- My man delivered.
- And it wasn't so easy.

8
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:02,509
Because a lot of other clownfish
had their eyes on this place.

9
00:01:02,546 --> 00:01:04,980
You better believe they did...
every single one of them.

10
00:01:05,015 --> 00:01:07,040
You did good.

11
00:01:07,084 --> 00:01:09,712
And the neighborhood
is awesome.

12
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:21,391
So, you do like it, don't you?

13
00:01:21,432 --> 00:01:24,890
No, no. I do, I do.
I really do like it.

14
00:01:24,935 --> 00:01:27,870
But, Marlin, I know that
the drop off is desirable...

15
00:01:27,905 --> 00:01:30,169
with the great schools
and the amazing view...

16
00:01:30,207 --> 00:01:32,276
but do we really need
so much space?

17
00:01:32,309 --> 00:01:35,107
Coral, honey, these are our kids
we're talking about.

18
00:01:35,146 --> 00:01:37,307
They deserve the best.
Look, look, look.

19
00:01:37,348 --> 00:01:39,578
They'll wake up,
poke their little heads out...

20
00:01:39,617 --> 00:01:42,684
and they see a whale!
Right by their bedroom window.

21
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,018
You'll wake the kids.

22
00:01:45,055 --> 00:01:46,852
Oh, right, right.

23
00:01:50,594 --> 00:01:55,361
Aw, look. They're dreaming.

24
00:01:55,399 --> 00:01:57,560
We still have to name them.

25
00:01:57,601 --> 00:01:59,364
You want to name
all of them right now?

26
00:01:59,403 --> 00:02:02,668
All right, we'll name
this half Marlin Junior...

27
00:02:02,706 --> 00:02:04,833
and this half Coral Junior.

28
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:07,435
- OK, we're done.
- I like Nemo.

29
00:02:07,478 --> 00:02:10,242
Nemo. We'll name one Nemo...

30
00:02:10,281 --> 00:02:12,841
but I'd like most of them
to be Marlin Junior.

31
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:14,248
Just think,
in a couple of days...

32
00:02:14,285 --> 00:02:17,777
- we're going to be parents.
- Yeah.

33
00:02:17,821 --> 00:02:19,448
What if they don't like me?

34
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:21,014
- Marlin.
- No, really.

35
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:26,018
There's over 400 eggs.
Odds are, one will like you.

36
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,360
What?

37
00:02:30,401 --> 00:02:34,030
- You remember how we met?
- I try not to.

38
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:35,538
Well, I remember.
"Excuse me, miss..."

39
00:02:35,573 --> 00:02:38,041
"can you check and see
if I have a hook in my lip?"

40
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:40,441
You got a little closer
because it was wiggling.

41
00:02:40,477 --> 00:02:43,605
- Get away, get away!
- Here he is. Cutie's here.

42
00:02:45,482 --> 00:02:47,575
Where did everybody go?

43
00:02:54,358 --> 00:02:56,451
Coral, get inside the house.

44
00:02:57,995 --> 00:03:00,395
No, Coral, don't.
They'll be fine.

45
00:03:00,431 --> 00:03:03,025
Just get inside...
You, right now.

46
00:03:05,803 --> 00:03:07,668
No!

47
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:27,452
Coral!

48
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:34,931
Coral?

49
00:03:37,101 --> 00:03:38,432
Coral?

50
00:03:45,309 --> 00:03:46,571
Coral?

51
00:03:49,013 --> 00:03:50,344
Coral?

52
00:03:56,353 --> 00:03:58,048
Coral?

53
00:04:20,778 --> 00:04:22,609
There, there, there.

54
00:04:22,646 --> 00:04:25,137
It's OK. Daddy's here.

55
00:04:26,383 --> 00:04:28,044
Daddy's got you.

56
00:04:30,888 --> 00:04:35,416
I promise, I will never
let anything happen to you...

57
00:04:35,459 --> 00:04:37,222
Nemo.

58
00:05:13,697 --> 00:05:16,132
First day of school!

59
00:05:16,133 --> 00:05:18,931
Wake up, wake up!
First day of school.

60
00:05:18,969 --> 00:05:21,460
I don't want to go to school...
five more minutes.

61
00:05:21,505 --> 00:05:22,767
Not you, Dad, me.

62
00:05:22,806 --> 00:05:24,205
- OK?
- Get up, get up.

63
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:26,937
It's time for school,
time for school.

64
00:05:26,977 --> 00:05:28,535
All right, I'm up.

65
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,009
- Nemo!
- First day of school!

66
00:05:32,049 --> 00:05:34,210
Nemo, don't move.

67
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:35,650
You'll never get out
of there yourself.

68
00:05:35,686 --> 00:05:37,847
I'll do it.

69
00:05:37,888 --> 00:05:39,856
- You feel a break?
- No.

70
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:41,619
Sometimes you can't tell
'cause fluid rushes to the area.

71
00:05:41,658 --> 00:05:43,853
- Are you woozy?
- No.

72
00:05:43,894 --> 00:05:46,158
- How many stripes do I have?
- I'm fine.

73
00:05:46,196 --> 00:05:47,993
- Answer the stripe question.
- Three.

74
00:05:48,031 --> 00:05:49,498
No! See?
Something's wrong with you.

75
00:05:49,533 --> 00:05:52,331
I have one, two, three...
That's all I have?

76
00:05:52,369 --> 00:05:55,270
You're OK. How's the lucky fin?

77
00:05:55,305 --> 00:05:58,103
- Lucky.
- Let's see.

78
00:05:59,576 --> 00:06:01,066
Are you sure you want to go
to school this year?

79
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:04,012
There's no problem if you don't.
You can wait 5 or 6 years.

80
00:06:04,047 --> 00:06:05,912
Come on, Dad,
it's time for school.

81
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:08,611
Forgot to brush.

82
00:06:08,652 --> 00:06:10,643
Do you want this anemone
to sting you?

83
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:13,087
- Yes.
- Brush.

84
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:14,784
- OK, I'm done.
- You missed a spot.

85
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:16,786
- Where?
- There.

86
00:06:16,827 --> 00:06:19,796
Right there. And here and here.

87
00:06:28,772 --> 00:06:29,932
All right, we're excited.

88
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:31,736
The first day of school.
Here we go.

89
00:06:31,775 --> 00:06:33,743
We're ready to learn
to get some knowledge.

90
00:06:33,777 --> 00:06:36,177
What's the one thing we have
to remember about the ocean?

91
00:06:36,213 --> 00:06:38,647
- It's not safe.
- That's my boy.

92
00:06:38,682 --> 00:06:40,946
First, we check to see
that the coast is clear.

93
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:43,384
We go out... and back in.

94
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:45,718
And then we go out...
and back in.

95
00:06:45,756 --> 00:06:48,782
And then one more time...
out and back in.

96
00:06:48,826 --> 00:06:50,657
And sometimes, if you want
to do it four times...

97
00:06:50,694 --> 00:06:53,060
- Dad...
- All right, come on, boy.

98
00:06:55,766 --> 00:06:58,860
Maybe while I'm at school,
I'll see a shark.

99
00:06:58,902 --> 00:07:01,564
- I highly doubt that.
- Have you ever met a shark?

100
00:07:01,605 --> 00:07:03,266
No, and I don't plan to.

101
00:07:03,307 --> 00:07:06,504
- How old are sea turtles?
- I don't know.

102
00:07:06,543 --> 00:07:08,238
Sandy Plankton
from next door...

103
00:07:08,278 --> 00:07:11,180
he says that sea turtles live
to be about 100 years old.

104
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:13,615
He says that sea turtles live
to be about 100 years old.

105
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:15,914
If I ever meet a sea turtle,
I'll ask him.

106
00:07:15,953 --> 00:07:17,887
After I'm done
talking to the shark, OK?

107
00:07:17,921 --> 00:07:21,490
Hold on. Wait to cross.

108
00:07:21,558 --> 00:07:23,753
Hold my fin.

109
00:07:23,794 --> 00:07:25,125
Dad, you're not
going to freak out...

110
00:07:25,162 --> 00:07:27,153
like you did at
the petting zoo, are you?

111
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:29,961
That snail was about to charge.

112
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,434
I wonder where
we're supposed to go.

113
00:07:32,469 --> 00:07:33,959
Bye, Mom!

114
00:07:34,004 --> 00:07:36,097
I'll pick you up after school.

115
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:40,935
Come on, you guys, stop it!
Give it back!

116
00:07:40,978 --> 00:07:43,970
Come on, we'll try over there.

117
00:07:45,315 --> 00:07:47,374
Excuse me, is this where
we meet his teacher?

118
00:07:47,417 --> 00:07:49,942
Well, look who's out
of the anemone.

119
00:07:49,987 --> 00:07:51,187
Yes. Shocking, I know.

120
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:52,984
- Marty, right?
- Marlin.

121
00:07:53,023 --> 00:07:54,183
- Bob.
- Ted.

122
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:56,215
Bill. Hey, you're a clownfish.

123
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:58,820
You're funny, right?
Tell us a joke.

124
00:07:58,862 --> 00:08:00,159
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

125
00:08:00,197 --> 00:08:03,098
Well, actually,
that's a common misconception.

126
00:08:03,133 --> 00:08:05,658
Clownfish are no funnier
than any other fish.

127
00:08:05,702 --> 00:08:07,693
- Come on, clownie.
- Do something funny.

128
00:08:07,738 --> 00:08:10,206
All right, I know one joke.

129
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,301
There's a mollusk, see?
And he walks up to a sea...

130
00:08:14,344 --> 00:08:16,403
He doesn't walk up,
he swims up.

131
00:08:16,446 --> 00:08:18,311
Actually,
the mollusk isn't moving.

132
00:08:18,348 --> 00:08:21,909
He's in one place,
and then the sea cucumber...

133
00:08:21,952 --> 00:08:23,419
Well, they... I'm mixed up.

134
00:08:23,453 --> 00:08:26,183
There was a mollusk
and a sea cucumber.

135
00:08:26,223 --> 00:08:27,824
None of them were walking,
so forget that I...

136
00:08:27,825 --> 00:08:31,055
Sheldon! Get out of
Mr. Johannsen's yard now!

137
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:33,460
All right, you kids!

138
00:08:33,497 --> 00:08:36,557
Where'd you go?

139
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,761
Dad, can I go play, too? Can I?

140
00:08:38,802 --> 00:08:41,794
I would feel better if
you'd play on the sponge beds.

141
00:08:46,376 --> 00:08:48,344
That's where I would play.

142
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:52,414
- What's wrong with his fin?
- He looks funny.

143
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:54,815
Hey, what'd I do?

144
00:08:54,851 --> 00:08:56,819
Be nice.
It's his first time at school.

145
00:08:56,853 --> 00:08:59,549
He was born with it.
We call it his lucky fin.

146
00:08:59,656 --> 00:09:01,851
- Dad...
- See this tentacle?

147
00:09:01,892 --> 00:09:04,019
It's actually shorter
than all my other tentacles...

148
00:09:04,061 --> 00:09:06,188
but you can't really tell.

149
00:09:06,229 --> 00:09:08,663
Especially when
I twirl them like this.

150
00:09:08,699 --> 00:09:10,758
I'm H-2-O intolerant.

151
00:09:10,801 --> 00:09:12,769
I'm obnoxious.

152
00:09:14,404 --> 00:09:17,237
Let's name the zones,
the zones, the zones

153
00:09:17,274 --> 00:09:20,437
Let's name
the zones of the open sea

154
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:21,671
Mr. Ray!

155
00:09:21,712 --> 00:09:24,613
- Come on, Nemo.
- You better stay with me.

156
00:09:24,648 --> 00:09:26,513
Mesopelagic, bathyal,
abyssalpelagic

157
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:29,986
All the rest are too deep
for you and me to see

158
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:33,353
I wonder where
my class has gone?

159
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:35,119
We're under here!

160
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:37,023
Oh, there you are.

161
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:38,618
Climb aboard, explorers.

162
00:09:38,662 --> 00:09:39,959
Oh, knowledge exploring

163
00:09:39,997 --> 00:09:41,487
is, oh, so lyrical

164
00:09:41,531 --> 00:09:43,965
When you think thoughts
that are empirical

165
00:09:44,001 --> 00:09:45,161
Dad, you can go now.

166
00:09:45,202 --> 00:09:48,296
- Hello. Who is this?
- I'm Nemo.

167
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:52,001
Nemo, all new explorers
must answer a science question.

168
00:09:52,042 --> 00:09:54,840
- OK.
- You live in what kind of home?

169
00:09:54,878 --> 00:09:56,573
An anemon-none.

170
00:09:56,613 --> 00:09:58,604
A nemenem-menome.

171
00:09:58,649 --> 00:10:01,675
OK, don't hurt yourself.
Welcome aboard, explorers.

172
00:10:01,718 --> 00:10:03,652
Just so you know,
he's got a little fin.

173
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:05,348
I find if he's having
trouble swimming...

174
00:10:05,389 --> 00:10:07,357
I let him take a break,
10, 15 minutes.

175
00:10:07,391 --> 00:10:09,825
Dad, it's time
for you to go now.

176
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,919
Don't worry. We're gonna
stay together as a group.

177
00:10:11,962 --> 00:10:14,362
OK, class,
optical orbits up front.

178
00:10:14,398 --> 00:10:17,390
And remember, we keep
our supraesophogeal ganglion...

179
00:10:17,434 --> 00:10:19,868
to ourselves.
That means you, Jimmy.

180
00:10:20,003 --> 00:10:21,868
Aw, man!

181
00:10:21,905 --> 00:10:23,930
Bye, Nemo!

182
00:10:23,974 --> 00:10:25,373
Bye, Dad!

183
00:10:25,409 --> 00:10:27,070
Bye, son!

184
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,076
Be safe.

185
00:10:31,114 --> 00:10:33,674
You're doing pretty well
for a first-timer.

186
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:36,049
You can't hold on to them
forever, can you?

187
00:10:36,086 --> 00:10:38,316
I had a tough time with
my oldest out at the drop off.

188
00:10:38,355 --> 00:10:40,619
They got to grow up...
The drop off?

189
00:10:40,657 --> 00:10:43,524
They're going to the drop off?
What are you, insane?

190
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,859
Why don't we fry them up now
and serve them with chips?

191
00:10:46,897 --> 00:10:48,159
Hey, Marty, calm down.

192
00:10:48,198 --> 00:10:50,462
Don't tell me
to be calm, pony boy.

193
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,798
Pony boy?

194
00:10:52,836 --> 00:10:55,703
For a clownfish,
he really isn't that funny.

195
00:10:55,739 --> 00:10:57,138
Pity.

196
00:10:59,076 --> 00:11:01,636
Let's name the species,
the species, the species

197
00:11:01,678 --> 00:11:02,975
Let's name the species
that live in the sea

198
00:11:04,214 --> 00:11:06,011
There's

199
00:11:06,049 --> 00:11:08,108
Porifera, coelenterata,
hydrozoa, scyphozoa

200
00:11:08,151 --> 00:11:10,210
Anthozoa, ctenophora,
bryozoas, three

201
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:12,915
Gastropoda, arthropoda,
echinoderma

202
00:11:12,956 --> 00:11:14,253
And some fish like you and me

203
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:15,622
Come on, sing with me.

204
00:11:22,866 --> 00:11:24,731
Just the girls this time.

205
00:11:24,768 --> 00:11:26,736
Oh, seaweed is cool

206
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,032
Seaweed is fun

207
00:11:28,071 --> 00:11:29,538
it makes its food

208
00:11:32,843 --> 00:11:34,868
OK, the drop off.

209
00:11:34,911 --> 00:11:37,175
All right, kids,
feel free to explore...

210
00:11:37,214 --> 00:11:38,374
but stay close.

211
00:11:38,415 --> 00:11:40,610
Stromalitic cyanobacteria! Gather.

212
00:11:41,952 --> 00:11:44,682
An entire ecosystem contained
in one infinitesimal speck.

213
00:11:44,721 --> 00:11:46,382
There are as many protein pairs
contained in this...

214
00:11:46,423 --> 00:11:48,857
Come on, let's go.

215
00:11:48,892 --> 00:11:50,257
Come on, sing with me!

216
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:52,557
There's porifera, coelenterata

217
00:11:52,596 --> 00:11:54,063
Hydrozoa, scyphozoa

218
00:11:54,097 --> 00:11:55,665
Anthozoa, ctenophora,
bryozoas, three

219
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:58,725
Hey, guys, wait up!

220
00:12:03,673 --> 00:12:05,766
Cool.

221
00:12:07,444 --> 00:12:09,071
Saved your life!

222
00:12:09,112 --> 00:12:11,444
Aw, you guys made me ink.

223
00:12:12,883 --> 00:12:14,316
What's that?

224
00:12:15,752 --> 00:12:18,778
I know what that is.
Sandy Plankton saw one.

225
00:12:18,822 --> 00:12:21,916
He said it was called a butt.

226
00:12:23,426 --> 00:12:25,724
That's a pretty big butt.

227
00:12:27,197 --> 00:12:30,394
Oh, look at me.
I'm going to touch the butt.

228
00:12:32,936 --> 00:12:35,734
Oh, yeah?
Let's see you get closer.

229
00:12:35,772 --> 00:12:37,399
OK.

230
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,931
Beat that.

231
00:12:39,976 --> 00:12:42,501
Come on, Nemo.
How far can you go?

232
00:12:42,546 --> 00:12:45,014
My dad says it's not safe.

233
00:12:45,048 --> 00:12:47,983
- Nemo! No!
- Dad?

234
00:12:48,018 --> 00:12:49,451
You were about
to swim into open water.

235
00:12:49,486 --> 00:12:50,714
No, I wasn't...

236
00:12:50,754 --> 00:12:52,585
Good thing I was here.
If I hadn't shown up...

237
00:12:52,622 --> 00:12:54,886
- He wasn't going to go.
- He was too afraid.

238
00:12:54,925 --> 00:12:56,222
No, I wasn't.

239
00:12:56,259 --> 00:12:57,692
This does not
concern you, kids...

240
00:12:57,727 --> 00:13:00,093
and you're lucky
I don't tell your parents.

241
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:01,427
You know you can't swim well.

242
00:13:01,464 --> 00:13:03,398
I can swim fine, Dad, OK?

243
00:13:03,433 --> 00:13:06,334
No, it's not OK.
You shouldn't be near here.

244
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:08,769
OK, I was right. You'll start
school in a year or two.

245
00:13:08,805 --> 00:13:11,535
No, Dad! Just because
you're scared of the ocean...

246
00:13:11,575 --> 00:13:12,742
Clearly, you're not ready...

247
00:13:12,776 --> 00:13:13,936
and you're not coming back
until you are.

248
00:13:13,977 --> 00:13:15,239
You think
you can do these things...

249
00:13:15,278 --> 00:13:17,178
but you just can't, Nemo!

250
00:13:18,515 --> 00:13:20,107
I hate you.

251
00:13:21,318 --> 00:13:23,946
There's

252
00:13:23,987 --> 00:13:25,818
Nothing to see.
Gather. Over there.

253
00:13:25,856 --> 00:13:27,118
Excuse me.
Is there anything I can do?

254
00:13:27,157 --> 00:13:29,216
I am a scientist, sir.
Is there any problem?

255
00:13:29,259 --> 00:13:31,352
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to interrupt things.

256
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:34,227
He isn't a good swimmer,
and it's a little too soon...

257
00:13:34,264 --> 00:13:35,993
for him to be out here
unsupervised.

258
00:13:36,032 --> 00:13:37,795
I can assure you,
he's quite safe with me.

259
00:13:37,834 --> 00:13:40,803
I'm sure he is,
but you have a large class...

260
00:13:40,837 --> 00:13:43,670
and he can get lost from sight
if you're not looking.

261
00:13:43,707 --> 00:13:44,907
I'm not saying
you're not looking.

262
00:13:44,941 --> 00:13:47,876
Oh, my gosh!
Nemo's swimming out to sea!

263
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:50,941
Nemo!

264
00:13:52,349 --> 00:13:54,044
What do you think you're doing?

265
00:13:54,084 --> 00:13:56,882
You'll get stuck out there...

266
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:00,412
and I'll have to get you
before another fish does.

267
00:14:00,523 --> 00:14:02,354
Get back here!

268
00:14:02,392 --> 00:14:05,384
I said get back here now!

269
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:10,263
Stop! You take
one more move, mister...

270
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,165
Don't you dare!

271
00:14:12,202 --> 00:14:14,261
If you put one fin
on that boat...

272
00:14:14,304 --> 00:14:15,794
Are you listening to me?

273
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:19,468
Don't touch the bo... Nemo!

274
00:14:19,509 --> 00:14:21,136
He touched the butt.

275
00:14:21,177 --> 00:14:23,907
You paddle your little tail
right back here, Nemo.

276
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:25,107
That's right.

277
00:14:25,148 --> 00:14:26,843
You are in big trouble,
young man.

278
00:14:26,883 --> 00:14:28,680
Do you hear me? Big...

279
00:14:30,487 --> 00:14:32,455
Big...

280
00:14:35,692 --> 00:14:37,751
Daddy! Help me!

281
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:40,763
I'm coming, Nemo!

282
00:14:42,065 --> 00:14:43,999
Get under me, kids!

283
00:14:44,034 --> 00:14:45,433
Oh! No!

284
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:47,163
Dad!

285
00:14:47,203 --> 00:14:49,603
Daddy!

286
00:14:52,842 --> 00:14:55,709
Oh! Nemo!

287
00:14:58,148 --> 00:15:00,139
Nemo!

288
00:15:00,183 --> 00:15:03,812
Nemo, no! Nemo!

289
00:15:03,853 --> 00:15:06,822
Nemo! Nemo! No!

290
00:15:08,725 --> 00:15:11,216
No!

291
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:21,660
Nemo! Nemo!

292
00:15:31,915 --> 00:15:33,177
Hold on.

293
00:15:45,962 --> 00:15:47,190
Oh, no.

294
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:49,824
No. No, it's gone. It's gone.

295
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:51,163
No, no, it can't be gone.

296
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:53,533
No, no! Nemo!

297
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:55,170
Nemo! Nemo!

298
00:15:55,171 --> 00:15:56,763
Nemo! Nemo!

299
00:15:56,806 --> 00:15:59,036
No!

300
00:15:59,142 --> 00:16:01,736
Nemo! Nemo!

301
00:16:01,778 --> 00:16:04,576
No! No, please, no!

302
00:16:07,384 --> 00:16:08,578
No, no!

303
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,511
Has anybody seen a boat?

304
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:14,386
Please! A white boat!

305
00:16:14,424 --> 00:16:16,085
They took my son!

306
00:16:16,126 --> 00:16:18,627
My son! Help me, please.

307
00:16:18,628 --> 00:16:20,528
- Look out!
- What?

308
00:16:22,999 --> 00:16:26,594
Oh, oh. Sorry.
I didn't see you.

309
00:16:26,636 --> 00:16:29,935
- Sir? Are you OK?
- He's gone, he's gone.

310
00:16:29,973 --> 00:16:31,406
There, there. It's all right.

311
00:16:31,441 --> 00:16:32,703
- He's gone.
- It'll be OK.

312
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:36,303
No, no. They took him away.
I have to find the boat.

313
00:16:36,346 --> 00:16:38,405
A boat? Hey, I've seen a boat.

314
00:16:38,448 --> 00:16:40,746
- You have?
- It passed by not too long ago.

315
00:16:40,784 --> 00:16:43,150
- A white one?
- Hi. I'm Dory.

316
00:16:43,186 --> 00:16:44,380
Where? Which way?

317
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:46,582
It went this way.

318
00:16:46,623 --> 00:16:48,022
It went this way. Follow me.

319
00:16:48,058 --> 00:16:51,425
Thank you. Thank you,
thank you so much.

320
00:16:51,461 --> 00:16:52,587
No problem.

321
00:17:17,587 --> 00:17:19,179
Hey...

322
00:17:19,222 --> 00:17:20,621
Wait!

323
00:17:26,729 --> 00:17:28,822
- Will you quit it?
- What?

324
00:17:28,865 --> 00:17:31,629
I'm trying to swim here.
Ocean isn't big enough for you?

325
00:17:32,001 --> 00:17:33,866
You got a problem, buddy?

326
00:17:33,903 --> 00:17:36,599
Do you? Do you?
You want a piece of me?

327
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:38,504
I'm scared now. What?

328
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:41,135
- Wait a minute.
- Stop following me, OK?

329
00:17:41,177 --> 00:17:44,305
What? You're showing me
where the boat went.

330
00:17:44,347 --> 00:17:45,949
A boat? Hey, I've seen a boat.

331
00:17:46,182 --> 00:17:49,379
It passed by not too long ago.
It went this way.

332
00:17:49,419 --> 00:17:50,818
It went this way. Follow me.

333
00:17:50,854 --> 00:17:52,981
Wait a minute.
What is going on?

334
00:17:53,022 --> 00:17:55,320
You already told me
which way the boat was going.

335
00:17:55,358 --> 00:17:58,555
I did? Oh, no.

336
00:17:58,595 --> 00:18:00,893
If this is some kind of
practical joke, it's not funny.

337
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:03,228
And I know funny.
I'm a clownfish.

338
00:18:03,266 --> 00:18:06,667
No, it's not. I know it's not.
I'm so sorry.

339
00:18:06,703 --> 00:18:09,672
See, I suffer from
short-term memory loss.

340
00:18:09,706 --> 00:18:13,540
Short-term memory loss.
I don't believe this.

341
00:18:13,576 --> 00:18:15,441
No, it's true. I forget things
almost instantly.

342
00:18:15,478 --> 00:18:19,437
It runs in my family.
At least, I think it does.

343
00:18:19,482 --> 00:18:23,509
Where are they?

344
00:18:28,258 --> 00:18:29,691
Can I help you?

345
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:32,354
Something's wrong
with you... really.

346
00:18:32,395 --> 00:18:34,260
You're wasting my time.

347
00:18:34,297 --> 00:18:36,356
I have to find my son.

348
00:18:39,636 --> 00:18:41,160
Hello.

349
00:18:41,204 --> 00:18:43,195
Well, hi!

350
00:18:43,239 --> 00:18:46,265
Name's Bruce.

351
00:18:46,309 --> 00:18:48,072
It's all right. I understand.

352
00:18:48,111 --> 00:18:51,842
Why trust a shark, right?

353
00:18:58,922 --> 00:19:02,016
So, what's a couple
of bites like you...

354
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:03,719
doing out so late, eh?

355
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,785
We're not doing anything.
We're not even out.

356
00:19:05,828 --> 00:19:08,058
Great!
Then how'd you morsels...

357
00:19:08,097 --> 00:19:11,362
like to come to a little
get-together I'm having?

358
00:19:11,401 --> 00:19:12,595
You mean, like a party?

359
00:19:12,635 --> 00:19:16,696
Yeah, right. A party.
What do you say?

360
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:18,900
I love parties.
That sounds like fun.

361
00:19:18,942 --> 00:19:21,342
Parties are fun,
and it's tempting, but...

362
00:19:21,377 --> 00:19:25,279
Oh, come on, I insist.

363
00:19:25,315 --> 00:19:28,512
OK. That's all that matters.

364
00:19:31,154 --> 00:19:33,315
Hey, look, balloons.
It is a party.

365
00:19:33,356 --> 00:19:35,688
Mind your distance, though.

366
00:19:35,725 --> 00:19:38,387
Those balloons
can be a bit dodgy.

367
00:19:38,428 --> 00:19:40,726
You wouldn't want
one of them to pop.

368
00:19:54,677 --> 00:19:57,305
Anchor! Chum!

369
00:19:57,347 --> 00:20:00,145
There you are, Bruce. Finally.

370
00:20:00,183 --> 00:20:02,845
- We got company.
- It's about time, mate.

371
00:20:02,885 --> 00:20:04,353
We've already gone
through the snacks...

372
00:20:04,387 --> 00:20:05,945
and I'm still starving.

373
00:20:05,989 --> 00:20:08,184
We almost had a feeding frenzy.

374
00:20:08,224 --> 00:20:09,953
Come on,
let's get this over with.

375
00:20:11,194 --> 00:20:12,786
Right, then.

376
00:20:12,829 --> 00:20:15,127
The meeting has officially
come to order.

377
00:20:15,164 --> 00:20:16,654
Let us all say the pledge.

378
00:20:16,699 --> 00:20:21,193
I am a nice shark,
not a mindless eating machine.

379
00:20:21,237 --> 00:20:23,865
If I am to change this image...

380
00:20:23,906 --> 00:20:26,340
I must first change myself.

381
00:20:26,376 --> 00:20:29,106
Fish are friends, not food.

382
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:30,476
Except stinkin' dolphins.

383
00:20:30,513 --> 00:20:33,539
Dolphins. Yeah.
They think they're so cute.

384
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:35,312
"Look at me.
I'm a flippin' little dolphin."

385
00:20:35,351 --> 00:20:37,012
"Let me flip for you.
Ain't I something?"

386
00:20:37,053 --> 00:20:39,647
Right, then.
Today's meeting is Step 5...

387
00:20:39,689 --> 00:20:41,350
Bring a Fish Friend.

388
00:20:41,391 --> 00:20:42,881
Do you all have your friends?

389
00:20:42,925 --> 00:20:44,085
Got mine.

390
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:48,088
- Hey, there.
- How about you, Chum?

391
00:20:48,131 --> 00:20:52,659
Oh, I... seem to have
misplaced my friend.

392
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:55,635
That's all right, Chum.

393
00:20:55,672 --> 00:20:57,196
I had a feeling
this would be a difficult step.

394
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,764
You can help yourself
to one of my friends.

395
00:20:58,808 --> 00:21:02,266
Thanks, mate.
A little chum for Chum?

396
00:21:02,312 --> 00:21:03,973
I'll start the testimonies.

397
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:06,243
Hello. My name is Bruce.

398
00:21:06,282 --> 00:21:07,544
Hello, Bruce.

399
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:09,744
It has been three weeks
since my last fish.

400
00:21:09,786 --> 00:21:13,222
On my honor, or may I be
chopped up and made into soup.

401
00:21:13,256 --> 00:21:16,020
- You're an inspiration!
- Amen.

402
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:18,693
Right, then. Who's next?

403
00:21:18,728 --> 00:21:20,025
Pick me, pick me.

404
00:21:20,063 --> 00:21:21,928
Yes. The little
Sheila down the front.

405
00:21:21,964 --> 00:21:24,023
Come on up here.

406
00:21:25,001 --> 00:21:26,866
Hi. I'm Dory.

407
00:21:26,903 --> 00:21:29,303
- Hello, Dory.
- And well...

408
00:21:29,339 --> 00:21:32,502
I don't think
I've ever eaten a fish.

409
00:21:32,542 --> 00:21:36,103
- That's incredible.
- Good on you, mate.

410
00:21:36,145 --> 00:21:38,170
I'm glad
I got that off my chest.

411
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:39,545
All right, anyone else?

412
00:21:39,582 --> 00:21:42,176
How about you, mate?
What's your problem?

413
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:44,448
Me? I don't have a problem.

414
00:21:44,487 --> 00:21:45,852
Oh, OK.

415
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:47,480
Denial.

416
00:21:47,523 --> 00:21:49,354
Just start with your name.

417
00:21:49,392 --> 00:21:52,088
OK. Hello.

418
00:21:52,128 --> 00:21:55,222
My name is Marlin.
I'm a clownfish.

419
00:21:55,264 --> 00:21:58,290
- A clownfish? Really?
- Tell us a joke.

420
00:21:58,334 --> 00:22:00,063
I love jokes.

421
00:22:00,103 --> 00:22:03,095
I actually do know one
that's pretty good.

422
00:22:03,139 --> 00:22:05,164
There was this mollusk...

423
00:22:05,208 --> 00:22:07,540
and he walks up
to a sea cucumber.

424
00:22:07,577 --> 00:22:09,408
Normally, they don't talk,
sea cucumbers...

425
00:22:09,445 --> 00:22:11,413
but in a joke,
everyone talks...

426
00:22:11,447 --> 00:22:14,507
so the sea mollusk
says to the cucumber...

427
00:22:16,219 --> 00:22:18,813
Daddy!

428
00:22:18,855 --> 00:22:20,186
Nemo!

429
00:22:20,223 --> 00:22:23,249
Nemo! Nemo! I don't get it.

430
00:22:23,292 --> 00:22:25,192
For a clownfish,
he's not that funny.

431
00:22:25,228 --> 00:22:27,059
No, no, no, no. He's my son.

432
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:29,155
He was taken by these divers.

433
00:22:29,198 --> 00:22:31,894
Oh, my. You poor fish.

434
00:22:31,934 --> 00:22:33,902
Humans... think they own
everything.

435
00:22:33,936 --> 00:22:35,198
Probably American.

436
00:22:35,238 --> 00:22:39,339
Now, there is a father...
Looking for his little boy.

437
00:22:39,409 --> 00:22:41,900
What do these markings mean?

438
00:22:41,944 --> 00:22:44,276
I never knew my father!

439
00:22:44,313 --> 00:22:46,713
- Group hug.
- We're all mates here, mate.

440
00:22:46,749 --> 00:22:47,977
I can't read human.

441
00:22:48,017 --> 00:22:49,279
We got to find a fish
that can read this.

442
00:22:49,318 --> 00:22:51,286
- Hey, look, sharks.
- No, no, no, Dory!

443
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,447
- Guys, guys.
- No, Dory.

444
00:22:53,489 --> 00:22:54,820
That's mine. Give it to me.

445
00:22:54,857 --> 00:22:56,324
Gimme!

446
00:22:56,359 --> 00:22:58,327
Oh, I'm sorry. Are you OK?

447
00:22:58,428 --> 00:22:59,759
I'm so sorry.

448
00:22:59,796 --> 00:23:01,923
You really clocked me there.
Am I bleeding?

449
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:07,461
Dory, are you OK...

450
00:23:07,503 --> 00:23:08,304
That's good.

451
00:23:08,305 --> 00:23:11,034
That's good.

452
00:23:11,073 --> 00:23:12,973
Intervention!

453
00:23:13,009 --> 00:23:15,603
- Just a bite.
- Hold it together, mate!

454
00:23:15,645 --> 00:23:18,273
Remember, Bruce,
fish are friends, not food!

455
00:23:18,314 --> 00:23:21,216
- Food!
- Dory, look out!

456
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:24,811
I'm having fish tonight!

457
00:23:24,854 --> 00:23:26,446
Remember the steps, mate!

458
00:23:32,261 --> 00:23:34,525
Just one bite!

459
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,366
G'day. Grr!

460
00:23:42,405 --> 00:23:43,667
There's no way out!

461
00:23:43,706 --> 00:23:45,469
There's got to be a way
to escape!

462
00:23:47,677 --> 00:23:49,010
Who is it?

463
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:50,376
Dory, help me find a way out!

464
00:23:50,413 --> 00:23:52,938
Sorry. Come back later.
We're trying to escape.

465
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:57,550
- There's got to be a way out!
- Here's something.

466
00:23:57,587 --> 00:24:00,317
"Es-cap-e."
I wonder what that means.

467
00:24:00,356 --> 00:24:01,880
Funny. It's spelled
just like "escape."

468
00:24:01,924 --> 00:24:03,186
Let's go.

469
00:24:03,226 --> 00:24:06,320
Here's Brucey!

470
00:24:06,362 --> 00:24:08,057
Wait a minute. You can read?

471
00:24:08,097 --> 00:24:10,088
I can read?
That's right. I can read!

472
00:24:10,132 --> 00:24:12,259
Well, then, here.
Read this now.

473
00:24:14,303 --> 00:24:17,067
He really doesn't mean it.
He never even knew his father.

474
00:24:17,106 --> 00:24:18,334
Don't fall off the wagon!

475
00:24:22,411 --> 00:24:24,847
Oh, no, it's blocked!

476
00:24:29,085 --> 00:24:30,382
No, Bruce, focus.

477
00:24:30,419 --> 00:24:32,546
Sorry about Bruce, mate.

478
00:24:32,588 --> 00:24:35,250
He's really a nice guy.

479
00:24:35,291 --> 00:24:36,519
I need to get that mask.

480
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,151
You want that mask? OK.

481
00:24:38,194 --> 00:24:40,958
No, no, no, no, no, no!

482
00:24:40,997 --> 00:24:43,522
Quick, grab the mask!

483
00:24:47,904 --> 00:24:50,236
Oh, no. Bruce?

484
00:24:50,273 --> 00:24:51,900
What?

485
00:24:53,209 --> 00:24:56,474
Swim away! Swim away!

486
00:24:56,512 --> 00:24:58,241
Aw, is the party over?

487
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:09,524
Nice.

488
00:25:12,619 --> 00:25:13,779
Dad?

489
00:25:16,623 --> 00:25:17,817
Daddy?

490
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,614
Barbara.

491
00:25:42,649 --> 00:25:44,480
Prep for his anterior crown,
would you, please?

492
00:25:44,518 --> 00:25:46,952
And I'm going to need
a few more cotton rolls.

493
00:25:46,987 --> 00:25:48,614
OK.

494
00:25:50,357 --> 00:25:52,086
Hello, little fella.

495
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,520
Beauty, isn't he?

496
00:25:54,561 --> 00:25:55,892
I found that guy
struggling for life...

497
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:57,624
out on the reef,
and I saved him.

498
00:25:57,664 --> 00:25:59,757
So, has that Novocaine
kicked in yet?

499
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:02,997
I think so.
We're ready to roll.

500
00:26:04,237 --> 00:26:05,761
Bubbles!

501
00:26:08,742 --> 00:26:10,334
My bubbles.

502
00:26:10,377 --> 00:26:11,742
He likes bubbles.

503
00:26:11,778 --> 00:26:15,475
No!

504
00:26:23,256 --> 00:26:24,484
Bonjour.

505
00:26:24,524 --> 00:26:28,324
Slow down, little fella.
There's nothing to worry about.

506
00:26:28,361 --> 00:26:31,592
- He's scared to death.
- I want to go home.

507
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:33,656
Do you know where my dad is?

508
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:36,464
Honey, your dad's probably
back at the pet store.

509
00:26:36,503 --> 00:26:37,663
Pet store?

510
00:26:37,704 --> 00:26:40,400
Yeah, you know, like,
I'm from Bob's Fish Mart.

511
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,998
- Pet Palace.
- Fish-O-Rama.

512
00:26:42,042 --> 00:26:43,509
- Mail order.
- Ebay.

513
00:26:43,543 --> 00:26:46,239
- So, which one is it?
- I'm from the ocean.

514
00:26:46,279 --> 00:26:48,213
The ocean. The ocean?

515
00:26:50,183 --> 00:26:52,879
He hasn't been decontaminated.
Jacques!

516
00:26:52,919 --> 00:26:54,250
- Oui.
- Clean him!

517
00:26:54,287 --> 00:26:55,811
Oui.

518
00:26:55,856 --> 00:26:58,290
- Ocean.
- La mer. Bon.

519
00:27:00,126 --> 00:27:02,253
Voila. He is clean.

520
00:27:04,731 --> 00:27:07,996
The big blue. What's it like?

521
00:27:08,034 --> 00:27:12,061
- Big and blue?
- I knew it.

522
00:27:12,105 --> 00:27:15,302
If there's anything you need,
just ask your Auntie Deb.

523
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:18,436
Or if I'm not around,
you can talk to my sister Flo.

524
00:27:18,478 --> 00:27:20,241
Hi. How are you?

525
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,804
Don't listen to anything
my sister says.

526
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:23,679
She's nuts.

527
00:27:23,717 --> 00:27:24,809
We got a live one.

528
00:27:24,851 --> 00:27:27,877
- Can't hear you, Peach.
- I said we got a live one.

529
00:27:27,921 --> 00:27:29,889
- Boy, oh, boy.
- What do we got?

530
00:27:29,923 --> 00:27:31,447
Root canal... and by the looks
of those x-rays...

531
00:27:31,491 --> 00:27:32,958
it's not going to be pretty.

532
00:27:34,728 --> 00:27:36,161
- Dam and clamp installed?
- Yep.

533
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:37,993
- What did he use to open?
- Gator-Glidden drill.

534
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:39,692
He seems to favor
that one lately.

535
00:27:39,733 --> 00:27:42,668
I can't see, Flo.

536
00:27:42,702 --> 00:27:44,829
You're getting a little too...

537
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:46,065
Now he's doing
the Schilder technique.

538
00:27:46,106 --> 00:27:47,505
He's using a Hedstrom file.

539
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:49,736
That's not a Hedstrom file.
That's a K-Flex.

540
00:27:49,776 --> 00:27:52,404
It has a teardrop cross-section.
Clearly a Hedstrom.

541
00:27:52,445 --> 00:27:53,935
- No, no, K-Flex.
- Hedstrom.

542
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:55,675
- K-Flex!
- Hedstrom!

543
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:57,774
There I go.
A little help, over here.

544
00:27:57,884 --> 00:27:59,681
I'll go deflate him.

545
00:28:02,122 --> 00:28:04,283
All right. Go ahead and rinse.

546
00:28:04,324 --> 00:28:07,657
Oh, the human mouth
is a disgusting place.

547
00:28:10,096 --> 00:28:12,030
- Hey, Nigel.
- What did I miss?

548
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:13,225
Root canal... a doozy.

549
00:28:13,266 --> 00:28:14,893
Root canal?
What did he use to open?

550
00:28:14,935 --> 00:28:16,960
- Gator-Glidden drill.
- He's favoring that one.

551
00:28:17,003 --> 00:28:19,995
Hope he doesn't get surplus
sealer at the portal terminus.

552
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:23,134
- Hello. Who's this?
- New guy.

553
00:28:23,176 --> 00:28:24,507
The dentist
took him off the reef.

554
00:28:24,544 --> 00:28:26,910
An outie. From my neck
of the woods, eh?

555
00:28:26,947 --> 00:28:28,437
Sorry if I ever took
a snap at you.

556
00:28:28,481 --> 00:28:29,880
Fish gotta swim,
birds gotta eat.

557
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:31,611
Hey! No, no, no, no!

558
00:28:31,651 --> 00:28:33,243
They're not your fish.
They're my fish.

559
00:28:33,286 --> 00:28:36,084
Come on, go. Go on, shoo!

560
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:39,085
Aw, the picture broke.

561
00:28:39,125 --> 00:28:41,184
This here's Darla.
She's my niece.

562
00:28:41,227 --> 00:28:42,694
She's going to be
eight this week.

563
00:28:42,729 --> 00:28:44,196
Hey, little fella.

564
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:45,993
Say hello to your new mummy.

565
00:28:46,032 --> 00:28:48,500
She'll be here Friday
to pick you up.

566
00:28:48,535 --> 00:28:50,366
You're her present.

567
00:28:50,403 --> 00:28:52,462
It's our little secret.

568
00:28:52,505 --> 00:28:54,029
Well, Mr. Tucker,
while that sets up...

569
00:28:54,074 --> 00:28:56,042
I'm going to see a man
about a wallaby.

570
00:28:57,877 --> 00:28:59,777
Oh, Darla.

571
00:28:59,813 --> 00:29:01,678
What? What's wrong with her?

572
00:29:01,715 --> 00:29:04,411
She wouldn't stop
shaking the bag.

573
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:08,217
- Poor Chuckles.
- He was her present last year.

574
00:29:08,254 --> 00:29:10,620
Hitched a ride
on the porcelain express.

575
00:29:12,492 --> 00:29:14,687
She's a fish killer.

576
00:29:14,728 --> 00:29:16,992
I can't go with that girl.

577
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:18,793
I have to get back to my dad.

578
00:29:18,832 --> 00:29:22,734
Daddy! Help me!

579
00:29:22,769 --> 00:29:23,929
Oh, he's stuck.

580
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:26,165
Nobody touch him.

581
00:29:28,441 --> 00:29:30,409
Nobody touch him.

582
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:37,582
Can you help me?

583
00:29:37,617 --> 00:29:39,584
No. You got yourself in there.

584
00:29:39,653 --> 00:29:41,314
You can get yourself out.

585
00:29:41,354 --> 00:29:43,618
- Gill...
- I want to see him do it.

586
00:29:43,657 --> 00:29:47,491
Calm down. Alternate wiggling
your fins and your tail.

587
00:29:47,527 --> 00:29:50,325
I can't. I have a bad fin.

588
00:29:50,363 --> 00:29:52,524
Never stopped me.

589
00:29:56,603 --> 00:29:59,163
Just think about
what you need to do.

590
00:30:03,143 --> 00:30:04,667
Come on.

591
00:30:08,882 --> 00:30:10,076
Perfect.

592
00:30:10,116 --> 00:30:11,481
- Yay!
- You did it!

593
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:13,281
Good squirming.

594
00:30:13,319 --> 00:30:16,914
From the ocean...
just like you, Gill.

595
00:30:16,956 --> 00:30:18,116
Yeah.

596
00:30:18,158 --> 00:30:20,524
I've seen that look before.

597
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,221
What are you thinking about?

598
00:30:22,262 --> 00:30:24,025
I'm thinking...

599
00:30:24,064 --> 00:30:27,625
tonight, we give the kid
a proper reception.

600
00:30:27,667 --> 00:30:29,328
So, kid,
you got a name or what?

601
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:32,065
Nemo. I'm Nemo.

602
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:36,675
Nemo. Nemo.

603
00:30:41,881 --> 00:30:43,576
Are you gonna eat that?

604
00:30:55,128 --> 00:30:58,791
Careful with that hammer.

605
00:31:01,301 --> 00:31:04,065
No, no.

606
00:31:04,104 --> 00:31:06,334
What does it say? Dory!

607
00:31:06,372 --> 00:31:07,999
A sea monkey has my money.

608
00:31:08,041 --> 00:31:10,305
Wake up. Get up. Come on.

609
00:31:10,343 --> 00:31:11,310
Come on!

610
00:31:11,344 --> 00:31:13,574
- Yes, I'm a natural blue.
- Get up!

611
00:31:13,613 --> 00:31:16,844
Look out! Sharks eat fish!

612
00:31:38,938 --> 00:31:40,997
Dusty.

613
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,564
The mask. Where's the mask?

614
00:31:44,244 --> 00:31:46,144
No! No, not the mask!

615
00:31:46,179 --> 00:31:48,704
Get it! Get the mask!
Get the mask! Get it!

616
00:31:52,886 --> 00:31:55,377
Hoo doot doo doot doot doo doot

617
00:31:56,856 --> 00:31:58,414
La la la la la la

618
00:31:58,458 --> 00:32:00,187
it just keeps going on,
doesn't it?

619
00:32:00,226 --> 00:32:02,626
Echo! Echo!

620
00:32:02,662 --> 00:32:03,890
Hey, what you doing?

621
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:05,192
It's gone. I've lost the mask.

622
00:32:05,231 --> 00:32:07,256
- Did you drop it?
- You dropped it!

623
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,892
That was my only chance
of finding my son.

624
00:32:08,935 --> 00:32:11,233
Now it's gone.

625
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:17,708
Hey, Mr. Grumpy Gills...

626
00:32:17,744 --> 00:32:19,336
when life gets you down,
know what you got to do?

627
00:32:19,379 --> 00:32:21,813
- I don't want to know.
- Just keep swimming.

628
00:32:21,848 --> 00:32:25,284
Just keep swimming,
swimming, swimming

629
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:27,548
What do we do? We swim, swim

630
00:32:27,587 --> 00:32:28,815
Dory, no singing.

631
00:32:28,855 --> 00:32:30,652
Ho ho ho ho ho ho

632
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:33,284
I love to swim

633
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:35,760
When you want to swim

634
00:32:35,795 --> 00:32:37,786
See, I'm going to get
stuck now with that song.

635
00:32:37,831 --> 00:32:42,067
- Now it's in my head.
- Sorry.

636
00:32:42,068 --> 00:32:43,501
Dory, do you see anything?

637
00:32:43,536 --> 00:32:45,265
- Something's got me.
- That was me. I'm sorry.

638
00:32:45,305 --> 00:32:48,672
- Who's that?
- Who could it be? It's me.

639
00:32:48,708 --> 00:32:51,973
Are you my conscience?

640
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:54,639
Yeah, yeah.
I'm your conscience.

641
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:57,582
We haven't spoken for a while.
How are you?

642
00:32:57,617 --> 00:32:59,881
- Can't complain.
- Yeah? Good.

643
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:01,648
Now, Dory,
I want you to tell me...

644
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:03,417
Do you see anything?

645
00:33:03,456 --> 00:33:07,051
I see a... I see a light.

646
00:33:07,093 --> 00:33:09,653
- A light?
- Yeah. Over there.

647
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:13,154
- Hey, conscience, am I dead?
- No. I see it, too.

648
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,831
What is it?

649
00:33:22,876 --> 00:33:27,677
It's so pretty.

650
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:32,515
I'm feeling... happy...

651
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:36,044
which is a big deal for me.

652
00:33:36,089 --> 00:33:37,579
I want to touch it.

653
00:33:39,192 --> 00:33:41,592
Hey, come back.
Come on back here.

654
00:33:41,628 --> 00:33:43,186
I'm gonna get you

655
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:44,992
I'm gonna get you.

656
00:33:45,031 --> 00:33:46,293
I'm gonna swim with you

657
00:33:46,332 --> 00:33:47,697
I'm gonna get you.

658
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:50,601
I'm gonna be your best friend

659
00:33:50,637 --> 00:33:51,797
Good feeling's gone.

660
00:33:58,645 --> 00:34:01,409
I can't see!
I don't know where I'm going!

661
00:34:03,316 --> 00:34:05,284
- The mask!
- What mask?

662
00:34:05,318 --> 00:34:07,616
OK, I can't see a thing.

663
00:34:09,022 --> 00:34:11,320
- Oh, gee.
- Hey, look, a mask.

664
00:34:11,357 --> 00:34:13,018
Read it!

665
00:34:13,059 --> 00:34:14,686
I'm sorry,
but if you could just...

666
00:34:14,727 --> 00:34:16,662
bring it a little closer,
I kind of need the light.

667
00:34:16,696 --> 00:34:19,631
That's great.
Keep it right there.

668
00:34:19,666 --> 00:34:22,396
- Just read it!
- OK, OK.

669
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:25,461
Mr. Bossy. "P."

670
00:34:25,505 --> 00:34:28,474
OK. "P. Sher..."

671
00:34:28,508 --> 00:34:31,602
"Sher... P. Sher..."
P. Shirley? P..."

672
00:34:33,513 --> 00:34:35,811
Oh. The first line's
"P. Sherman."

673
00:34:35,848 --> 00:34:38,043
"P. Sherman"
doesn't make any sense!

674
00:34:38,084 --> 00:34:40,314
OK. Second line. "42."

675
00:34:40,353 --> 00:34:42,321
Don't eat me. Don't eat me.

676
00:34:44,057 --> 00:34:45,649
Light, please!

677
00:34:47,026 --> 00:34:49,586
"Walla... walla..."

678
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:52,530
Waah! Waah! Waah!

679
00:34:52,565 --> 00:34:54,328
The second line's
"42 Wallaby Way."

680
00:34:54,367 --> 00:34:57,165
That's great.
Speed read. Take a guess.

681
00:34:57,203 --> 00:34:58,830
No pressure. No problem.
There's a lot of pressure.

682
00:34:58,871 --> 00:35:01,396
Pressure! Take a guess
now with pressure!

683
00:35:01,441 --> 00:35:04,535
- "Sydney"! It's "Sydney"!
- Duck!

684
00:35:06,546 --> 00:35:09,947
I'm dead.
I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead.

685
00:35:09,983 --> 00:35:11,348
I died. I'm dead.

686
00:35:19,726 --> 00:35:21,523
We did it, we did it

687
00:35:21,561 --> 00:35:23,256
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

688
00:35:23,296 --> 00:35:25,127
No eating here tonight, whoo!

689
00:35:25,164 --> 00:35:26,529
Eating here tonight

690
00:35:26,566 --> 00:35:27,863
No, no, no, eating here tonight

691
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,367
- Dory.
- You on a diet

692
00:35:29,402 --> 00:35:32,235
Dory! What did the mask say?

693
00:35:32,271 --> 00:35:34,102
P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

694
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:36,267
I remembered what it said!

695
00:35:36,309 --> 00:35:38,800
I usually forget things,
but I remembered it!

696
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:40,506
Wait. Where is that?

697
00:35:40,546 --> 00:35:42,980
I don't know.
But who cares? I remembered.

698
00:35:43,016 --> 00:35:44,210
Raar!

699
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:46,480
P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

700
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:48,544
I remembered it again!

701
00:36:15,248 --> 00:36:18,240
Nemo.

702
00:36:19,919 --> 00:36:22,615
Nemo

703
00:36:22,655 --> 00:36:25,522
Suivez-moi.

704
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:29,252
Follow me.

705
00:37:15,174 --> 00:37:16,766
Hahoo wahoo yahoo ho

706
00:37:16,809 --> 00:37:19,175
Hahoo wahoo yahoo ho

00:37:19,212 --> 00:37:21,305
Hahoo ho ho wahoo ha hee

00:37:21,347 --> 00:37:23,542
Ha ho wahee ha ho ho ho

709
00:37:23,583 --> 00:37:24,777
Hoo!

710
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:28,515
State your name.

711
00:37:28,554 --> 00:37:30,647
Nemo.

712
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:33,022
Brother Bloat, proceed.

713
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:38,062
Nemo, newcomer
of orange and white...

714
00:37:38,097 --> 00:37:39,462
you have been called forth...

715
00:37:39,499 --> 00:37:42,059
to the summit of
Mount Wannahockaloogie...

716
00:37:42,101 --> 00:37:47,403
to join with us in
the fraternal bonds of tankhood.

717
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:50,341
We want you in our club, kid.

718
00:37:50,376 --> 00:37:51,570
- Really?
- If...

719
00:37:51,611 --> 00:37:54,876
you are able to swim through...

720
00:37:54,914 --> 00:37:59,374
the Ring of Fire!

721
00:38:02,889 --> 00:38:04,720
Turn on the Ring of Fire!

722
00:38:04,757 --> 00:38:06,384
You said you could do it.

723
00:38:06,425 --> 00:38:08,017
The Ring of Fire!

724
00:38:10,396 --> 00:38:12,523
Bubbles, let me... Oh!

725
00:38:12,565 --> 00:38:15,329
Ha hwa ha ho ho ho

726
00:38:15,368 --> 00:38:17,700
Ha hwa ha ho ho ho

727
00:38:17,737 --> 00:38:20,069
Ha hwa ha ho ho ho

728
00:38:20,106 --> 00:38:23,200
Isn't there another way?
He's just a boy!

729
00:38:33,586 --> 00:38:38,683
From this moment on,
you will be known as Sharkbait.

730
00:38:38,724 --> 00:38:40,055
Sharkbait, oo-ha-ha!

731
00:38:40,092 --> 00:38:41,855
Welcome, Brother Sharkbait.

732
00:38:41,894 --> 00:38:43,122
Sharkbait, oo-ha-ha!

733
00:38:43,162 --> 00:38:45,187
- Enough with the Sharkbait.
- Sharkbait!

734
00:38:45,231 --> 00:38:47,096
Ba-ba-do.

735
00:38:47,133 --> 00:38:48,691
Sharkbait's
one of us now, agreed?

736
00:38:48,734 --> 00:38:50,793
- Agreed.
- We can't send him to his death.

737
00:38:50,836 --> 00:38:52,929
Darla's coming in five days.

738
00:38:52,972 --> 00:38:54,530
So, what are we going to do?

739
00:38:54,574 --> 00:38:57,134
I'll tell you
what we're gonna do...

740
00:38:57,176 --> 00:38:58,734
we're gonna get him
out of here.

741
00:38:58,778 --> 00:39:01,303
- We'll help him escape.
- Escape? Really?

742
00:39:01,347 --> 00:39:02,814
We're all gonna escape.

743
00:39:02,848 --> 00:39:05,476
Gill, please.
Not another escape plan.

744
00:39:05,518 --> 00:39:07,543
Sorry,
but they just never work.

745
00:39:07,587 --> 00:39:09,121
Why should this
be any different?

746
00:39:09,155 --> 00:39:12,613
- Because we've got him.
- Me?

747
00:39:12,658 --> 00:39:14,426
- You see that filter?
- Yeah.

748
00:39:14,427 --> 00:39:17,863
You're the only one who can get
in and out of that thing.

749
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:21,060
We need you to take
a pebble inside there...

750
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:22,328
and jam the gears.

751
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:24,336
You do that,
and this tank's gonna get...

752
00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:26,338
filthier and filthier
by the minute.

753
00:39:26,372 --> 00:39:28,704
Pretty soon, the dentist'll
have to clean the tank...

754
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:31,642
and when he does, he'll take us
out of the tank...

755
00:39:31,677 --> 00:39:33,235
put us in individual baggies...

756
00:39:33,279 --> 00:39:35,076
then we'll roll ourselves
down the counter...

757
00:39:35,114 --> 00:39:36,775
out the window,
off the awning...

758
00:39:36,816 --> 00:39:38,477
into the bushes,
across the street...

759
00:39:38,517 --> 00:39:40,985
and into the harbor!

760
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:43,955
It's foolproof. Who's with me?

761
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:45,389
- Aye!
- Aye!

762
00:39:45,424 --> 00:39:46,857
I think you're nuts.

763
00:39:48,027 --> 00:39:50,860
No offense, kid,
but you're not the best swimmer.

764
00:39:50,896 --> 00:39:53,296
He's fine. He can do this.

765
00:39:53,332 --> 00:39:56,790
So, Sharkbait,
what do you think?

766
00:39:56,836 --> 00:40:01,773
Let's do it.

767
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:04,743
I'm going to P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

768
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:06,074
Where are you going?

769
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:07,773
I'm going to P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

770
00:40:07,813 --> 00:40:09,440
If you ask where I'm going...

771
00:40:09,482 --> 00:40:11,211
I'll tell you
that's where I'm going.

772
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:12,717
It's P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

773
00:40:12,752 --> 00:40:14,515
Where? I'm sorry,
I didn't hear you.

774
00:40:14,553 --> 00:40:16,111
P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

775
00:40:16,155 --> 00:40:18,953
Excuse me.

776
00:40:18,991 --> 00:40:20,788
Hi. Do you know how to get...

777
00:40:20,826 --> 00:40:23,795
Hello? Wait. Can you tell me...

778
00:40:23,829 --> 00:40:28,163
Hey! Hold it!
I'm trying to talk to you!

779
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:31,567
Fellas, come back here.
One quick question.

780
00:40:31,604 --> 00:40:36,007
I need to...
And they're gone again.

781
00:40:36,042 --> 00:40:37,805
P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

782
00:40:37,843 --> 00:40:39,504
Why do I have to tell you
over and over again?

783
00:40:39,545 --> 00:40:41,536
I'll tell you again.
I don't get tired of it...

784
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:42,740
OK, all right.

785
00:40:42,782 --> 00:40:44,477
Here's the thing.

786
00:40:44,517 --> 00:40:50,012
I think it's best
if I carry on from here by...

787
00:40:50,056 --> 00:40:51,421
by myself.

788
00:40:51,457 --> 00:40:52,651
OK.

789
00:40:52,692 --> 00:40:54,387
You know, alone.

790
00:40:54,427 --> 00:40:56,452
Without... without...
I mean, not without you.

791
00:40:56,495 --> 00:40:59,862
But I don't
want you... with me.

792
00:40:59,899 --> 00:41:02,231
Am I...

793
00:41:02,268 --> 00:41:03,428
I don't want to hurt
your feelings.

794
00:41:03,469 --> 00:41:06,267
- You want me to leave?
- I mean, not... Yes.

795
00:41:06,305 --> 00:41:08,739
I just can't afford
any more delays...

796
00:41:08,774 --> 00:41:11,971
and you're one of those fish
that cause delays.

797
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:13,638
Sometimes it's a good thing.

798
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:16,705
There's a whole group of fish.
They're delay fish.

799
00:41:16,749 --> 00:41:18,307
You mean...

800
00:41:18,351 --> 00:41:20,012
You mean you don't like me?

801
00:41:20,052 --> 00:41:21,849
No, of course I like you.

802
00:41:21,887 --> 00:41:24,583
It's because I like you
I don't want to be with you.

803
00:41:24,623 --> 00:41:26,784
It's a complicated emotion.

804
00:41:26,826 --> 00:41:30,523
Don't cry. I like you.

805
00:41:30,563 --> 00:41:34,932
Hey, you!
Lady, is this guy bothering you?

806
00:41:34,967 --> 00:41:36,901
I don't remember. Were you?

807
00:41:36,936 --> 00:41:38,836
No, no, no, no, no.
We're just...

808
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:40,634
Do you guys know
how I can get to...

809
00:41:40,673 --> 00:41:43,005
Look, pal, we're talking
to the lady, not you.

810
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:44,634
Hey, hey. You like impressions?

811
00:41:46,746 --> 00:41:49,078
Just like in rehearsals,
gentlemen.

812
00:41:49,115 --> 00:41:50,673
So what are we? Take a guess.

813
00:41:50,716 --> 00:41:52,013
I've seen one of those.

814
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:54,246
I'm a fish with a nose
like a sword.

815
00:41:54,286 --> 00:41:56,254
- Wait, wait...
- It's a swordfish!

816
00:41:56,288 --> 00:41:59,357
Hey, clown boy,
let the lady guess.

817
00:41:59,358 --> 00:42:00,916
Where's the butter?

818
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,359
It's on the tip of my tongue!

819
00:42:02,395 --> 00:42:04,386
- Lobster.
- Saw that!

820
00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:06,261
Lots of legs!
Live in the ocean.

821
00:42:06,298 --> 00:42:07,697
- Clam!
- Close enough!

822
00:42:07,733 --> 00:42:09,223
Oh, it's a whale of a tale

823
00:42:09,268 --> 00:42:10,735
I'll tell you, lad...

824
00:42:10,770 --> 00:42:11,759
They're good.

825
00:42:11,804 --> 00:42:13,101
Will somebody please
give me directions?!

826
00:42:13,139 --> 00:42:15,505
"Will somebody please
give me directions?!"

827
00:42:15,541 --> 00:42:17,566
I'm serious!

828
00:42:17,610 --> 00:42:19,601
"Blah blah blah, me, me, blah!"

829
00:42:19,645 --> 00:42:20,839
"Blah blah blah, me, me, me!"

830
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,370
Thank you.

831
00:42:22,415 --> 00:42:24,906
Oh, dear. Hey! Hey, come back!

832
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:27,586
- Hey, what's the matter?
- What's the matter?

833
00:42:27,653 --> 00:42:29,621
While they're doing their
silly little impressions...

834
00:42:29,655 --> 00:42:33,785
I am miles from home with a fish
that can't remember her name!

835
00:42:33,826 --> 00:42:35,123
I bet that's frustrating.

836
00:42:35,161 --> 00:42:36,594
Meanwhile, my son is out there.

837
00:42:36,629 --> 00:42:38,620
- Your son Chico?
- Nemo?

838
00:42:38,664 --> 00:42:40,063
But it doesn't matter
because no fish...

839
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:42,067
in this entire ocean
is going to help me.

840
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:45,867
Well, I'm helping you.

841
00:42:45,905 --> 00:42:47,236
Wait right here.

842
00:42:48,474 --> 00:42:51,068
- Guys!
- Is he bothering you again?

843
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:52,634
No, no. He's a good guy.

844
00:42:52,678 --> 00:42:54,879
Go easy on him.
He's lost his son Fabio.

845
00:42:54,947 --> 00:42:57,814
Any of you heard of P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney?

846
00:42:57,917 --> 00:43:00,545
Sydney? Oh, sure!

847
00:43:00,586 --> 00:43:02,315
Ted here's got relatives
in Sydney.

848
00:43:02,354 --> 00:43:03,981
- Don't you, Ted?
- Sure do!

849
00:43:04,023 --> 00:43:05,513
Oh! Hey! They know Sydney!

850
00:43:06,759 --> 00:43:08,249
You wouldn't know how
to get there, would you?

851
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:10,262
You want to follow the E.A.C.

852
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:12,992
That's the East
Australian Current.

853
00:43:13,032 --> 00:43:14,659
Big current. Can't miss it.

854
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:17,669
It's in... that direction.

855
00:43:17,703 --> 00:43:19,603
And then you follow that
for about...

856
00:43:19,638 --> 00:43:21,401
I don't know.
What do you guys think?

857
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:22,600
About three leagues?

858
00:43:22,641 --> 00:43:25,610
That little baby will put you
right past Sydney.

859
00:43:25,644 --> 00:43:28,078
- Ta-da!
- That's great!

860
00:43:28,113 --> 00:43:29,307
Dory, you did it!

861
00:43:29,348 --> 00:43:31,179
Oh, please,
I'm just your little helper.

862
00:43:31,217 --> 00:43:33,549
- Helping along. That's me.
- Fellas, thank you.

863
00:43:33,586 --> 00:43:37,215
Don't mention it!
Just loosen up, OK, buddy?

864
00:43:37,256 --> 00:43:40,248
Oh, you guys.
You really nailed him. Bye.

865
00:43:40,292 --> 00:43:42,123
Oh, hey, ma'am. One more thing.

866
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:45,722
When you come to this trench,
swim through it, not over it.

867
00:43:45,764 --> 00:43:47,664
Trench...
through it, not over it.

868
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:50,396
I'll remember. Hey, hey!

869
00:43:51,837 --> 00:43:54,101
Hey, wait up, partner! Hold on!

870
00:43:54,139 --> 00:43:56,869
Wait, wait, wait!
I gotta tell you something.

871
00:43:59,645 --> 00:44:01,943
Nice trench.

872
00:44:03,682 --> 00:44:06,674
Hello!

873
00:44:09,388 --> 00:44:12,016
- OK, let's go.
- No, no. Bad trench.

874
00:44:12,057 --> 00:44:13,718
Come on, we'll swim over
this thing.

875
00:44:13,759 --> 00:44:15,886
Partner.
Little red flag going up.

876
00:44:15,928 --> 00:44:19,557
Something's telling me
to swim through it, not over it.

877
00:44:19,598 --> 00:44:21,225
Are you looking at this thing?

878
00:44:21,267 --> 00:44:22,757
It's got death
written all over it.

879
00:44:22,801 --> 00:44:25,634
I really, really, really
think we should swim through.

880
00:44:25,671 --> 00:44:27,901
And I'm really, really done
talking about this. Over we go.

881
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:29,908
- Trust me on this.
- Trust you?

882
00:44:29,942 --> 00:44:31,807
Yes, trust.
It's what friends do.

883
00:44:31,844 --> 00:44:33,744
Look! Something shiny!

884
00:44:33,779 --> 00:44:35,542
- Where?
- It just swam over the trench.

885
00:44:35,581 --> 00:44:41,286
- Come on, we'll follow it!
- OK!

886
00:44:41,287 --> 00:44:43,949
Boy, it sure is clear up here.

887
00:44:43,989 --> 00:44:47,447
Exactly. And look at that...
there's the current.

888
00:44:47,493 --> 00:44:50,087
We should be there in no time.

889
00:44:50,129 --> 00:44:51,926
Hey, little guy.

890
00:44:51,964 --> 00:44:53,727
You wanted to go
through the trench.

891
00:44:53,766 --> 00:44:55,791
I shall call him Squishy,
and he shall be mine.

892
00:44:55,834 --> 00:44:57,995
And he shall be my Squishy.
Come here, Squishy.

893
00:44:58,103 --> 00:44:59,536
Come here, little Squishy.

894
00:45:02,608 --> 00:45:05,475
- That's a jellyfish!
- Bad Squishy!

895
00:45:05,511 --> 00:45:07,308
Shoo, shoo! Get away!

896
00:45:07,346 --> 00:45:09,644
- Let me see that.
- Don't touch it.

897
00:45:09,682 --> 00:45:12,014
I won't touch it.
I just want to look.

898
00:45:12,051 --> 00:45:14,076
Hey! How come
it didn't sting you?

899
00:45:14,119 --> 00:45:15,643
It did. It's just that...

900
00:45:15,688 --> 00:45:17,383
Hold still.

901
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:18,890
I live in this anemone...

902
00:45:18,924 --> 00:45:20,789
and I'm used
to these kind of stings.

903
00:45:22,027 --> 00:45:24,018
It doesn't look bad.
You'll be fine.

904
00:45:24,063 --> 00:45:25,792
But now we know, don't we...

905
00:45:25,831 --> 00:45:28,026
that we don't want
to touch these again.

906
00:45:28,067 --> 00:45:31,093
Let's be thankful this time
it was just a little one.

907
00:45:33,572 --> 00:45:34,834
Don't move.

908
00:45:36,675 --> 00:45:39,576
- This is bad, Dory.
- Hey, watch this!

909
00:45:39,612 --> 00:45:41,273
Boing! Boing!

910
00:45:41,313 --> 00:45:42,541
Dory!

911
00:45:42,581 --> 00:45:44,913
You can't catch me

912
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:46,417
Don't bounce on the tops!

913
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:49,580
They will... not sting you!

914
00:45:49,622 --> 00:45:52,284
- The tops don't sting you!
- Two in a row! Beat that!

915
00:45:52,324 --> 00:45:55,259
Dory, listen to me.
I have an idea... a game.

916
00:45:55,294 --> 00:45:56,761
- A game?
- Yes.

917
00:45:56,862 --> 00:45:59,524
- I love games! Pick me!
- Here's the game.

918
00:45:59,565 --> 00:46:03,023
Whoever can hop the fastest
out of these jellyfish wins!

919
00:46:03,068 --> 00:46:04,695
- OK.
- Rules, rules, rules!

920
00:46:04,737 --> 00:46:07,297
You can't touch the tentacles.
Only the tops.

921
00:46:07,339 --> 00:46:09,204
Something about tentacles.
Got it. Go!

922
00:46:09,241 --> 00:46:12,176
Wait! Not something about 'em,
it's all about 'em!

923
00:46:12,211 --> 00:46:13,405
- Whee!
- Wait, Dory!

924
00:46:13,445 --> 00:46:15,546
Gotta go faster
if you want to win!

925
00:46:15,581 --> 00:46:16,741
Dory!

926
00:46:16,782 --> 00:46:18,750
Boing, boing, boing!

927
00:46:18,784 --> 00:46:21,651
Wait a minute! Dory!

928
00:46:21,687 --> 00:46:23,211
Whee!

929
00:46:23,255 --> 00:46:26,520
We're cheating death now.
That's what we're doing.

930
00:46:26,558 --> 00:46:28,219
But we're having fun
at the same time.

931
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:29,693
I can do this. Just be careful.

932
00:46:29,728 --> 00:46:31,628
Yeah, careful I don't
make you cry when I win!

933
00:46:31,664 --> 00:46:32,824
I don't think so!

934
00:46:36,268 --> 00:46:37,428
Give it up, old man.

935
00:46:37,469 --> 00:46:39,733
You can't fight evolution.
I was built for speed.

936
00:46:39,772 --> 00:46:41,740
The question is, Dory,
are you hungry?

937
00:46:41,774 --> 00:46:43,105
- Hungry?
- Yeah.

938
00:46:43,142 --> 00:46:45,872
'Cause you're about
to eat my bubbles!

939
00:46:45,911 --> 00:46:48,072
Duck to the left! Right there!

940
00:46:50,449 --> 00:46:52,883
The clownfish is the winner!

941
00:46:52,918 --> 00:46:55,978
We did it! Look at us!

942
00:46:56,021 --> 00:46:57,548
Dory?

943
00:46:59,783 --> 00:47:01,182
Oh, no.

944
00:47:02,252 --> 00:47:04,550
Dory! Dory!

945
00:47:04,588 --> 00:47:06,681
Dory!

946
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:10,889
Dory!

947
00:47:15,065 --> 00:47:17,795
Am I disqualified?

948
00:47:17,834 --> 00:47:19,802
No, you're doing fine!
You're actually winning!

949
00:47:19,836 --> 00:47:22,964
But you gotta stay awake.
Where does P. Sherman live?

950
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:25,907
P. Sherman...
Wallaby Way, Sydney...

951
00:47:25,943 --> 00:47:27,706
That's it!

952
00:47:28,946 --> 00:47:31,642
- Wallaby Way...
- Stay awake!

953
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:33,980
Stay awake! Stay awake!

954
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:37,783
Stay... awake!

955
00:47:40,324 --> 00:47:43,589
- Awake.
- P. Sherman.

956
00:47:43,627 --> 00:47:46,619
- Awake.
- 42 Wallaby Way.

957
00:47:46,663 --> 00:47:50,633
Wake up. Nemo...

958
00:48:05,349 --> 00:48:07,715
You miss your dad,
don't you, Sharkbait?

959
00:48:07,751 --> 00:48:09,119
Yeah.

960
00:48:09,152 --> 00:48:13,145
You're lucky to have someone
out there looking for you.

961
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:15,351
He's not looking for me.

962
00:48:15,392 --> 00:48:18,759
He's scared of the ocean.

963
00:48:18,795 --> 00:48:20,353
Peach, any movement?

964
00:48:20,430 --> 00:48:23,331
He's had four cups of coffee.
It's gotta be soon.

965
00:48:23,367 --> 00:48:24,891
Keep on him.

966
00:48:27,304 --> 00:48:30,137
My first escape...
landed on dental tools.

967
00:48:30,173 --> 00:48:31,606
I was aiming for the toilet.

968
00:48:31,642 --> 00:48:32,836
Toilet?

969
00:48:32,876 --> 00:48:35,470
All drains
lead to the ocean, kid.

970
00:48:35,512 --> 00:48:38,777
How many times have
you tried to get out?

971
00:48:38,815 --> 00:48:40,407
I've lost count.

972
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:42,384
Fish aren't meant
to be in a box, kid.

973
00:48:42,419 --> 00:48:44,080
It does things to you.

974
00:48:44,121 --> 00:48:46,248
Bubbles! Bubbles!

975
00:48:46,289 --> 00:48:48,655
Potty break! He grabbed
the "Reader's Digest."

976
00:48:48,692 --> 00:48:52,093
- We have 4.2 minutes!
- That's your cue, Sharkbait.

977
00:48:52,129 --> 00:48:54,427
- You can do it, kid.
- We gotta be quick.

978
00:48:54,665 --> 00:48:57,099
Once you get in, swim to
the bottom of the chamber...

979
00:48:57,134 --> 00:48:58,897
and I'll talk you
through the rest.

980
00:48:58,935 --> 00:49:01,733
- OK.
- It'll be a piece of kelp.

981
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:11,545
Nicely done!

982
00:49:11,581 --> 00:49:13,310
- Can you hear me?
- Yeah!

983
00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:15,841
Here comes the pebble.

984
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:18,314
Ptoo.

985
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:23,589
Now, do you see
a small opening?

986
00:49:25,095 --> 00:49:28,258
Inside it,
you'll see a rotating fan.

987
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:32,826
Wedge that pebble into the fan
to stop it turning.

988
00:49:37,574 --> 00:49:39,872
- Careful, Sharkbait!
- I can't do it!

989
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:41,434
Gill, this isn't a good idea.

990
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:43,241
He'll be fine. Try again!

991
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:45,976
OK.

992
00:49:46,016 --> 00:49:48,484
That's it, Sharkbait.

993
00:49:48,518 --> 00:49:50,816
Nice and steady.

994
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:54,848
I got it! I got it!

995
00:49:54,891 --> 00:49:57,621
- He did it!
- That's great, kid!

996
00:49:57,661 --> 00:49:59,856
Now swim up the tube and out.

997
00:50:17,147 --> 00:50:19,877
Oh, no! Gill!

998
00:50:19,916 --> 00:50:21,110
- Sharkbait!
- Oh, my gosh!

999
00:50:21,151 --> 00:50:22,379
Get him outta there!

1000
00:50:22,419 --> 00:50:24,944
- What do we do?
- Oh, no!

1001
00:50:24,988 --> 00:50:26,956
Stay calm, kid.
Just don't panic!

1002
00:50:27,991 --> 00:50:29,390
Help me!

1003
00:50:29,426 --> 00:50:31,792
Sharkbait, grab hold of this!

1004
00:50:35,298 --> 00:50:37,266
- No! No! No!
- Feed me more!

1005
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:40,235
- That's it!
- Sharkbait! Grab it!

1006
00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:42,966
I got it!

1007
00:50:43,006 --> 00:50:44,803
Pull!

1008
00:50:51,481 --> 00:50:54,177
Gill, don't make him
go back in there.

1009
00:50:55,418 --> 00:50:59,445
No. We're done.

1010
00:51:12,502 --> 00:51:14,197
Dude.

1011
00:51:14,237 --> 00:51:17,297
Dude.

1012
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:21,834
Focus, dude. Dude.

1013
00:51:23,547 --> 00:51:25,139
Oh, he lives. Hey, dude!

1014
00:51:25,182 --> 00:51:28,549
What happened?

1015
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:30,644
Saw the whole thing, dude.

1016
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:32,552
First, you were all,
like, "Whoa!"...

1017
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:34,216
and then we were
all, like, "Whoa!"...

1018
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:36,157
and then you were,
like, "Whoa."

1019
00:51:36,193 --> 00:51:37,626
What are you talking about?

1020
00:51:37,661 --> 00:51:41,097
You, mini-man.
Takin' on the jellies.

1021
00:51:41,131 --> 00:51:43,964
You got serious
thrill issues, dude.

1022
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,262
Awesome.

1023
00:51:45,302 --> 00:51:48,499
Oh, my stomach.

1024
00:51:48,538 --> 00:51:50,506
Oh, man. No hurlin'
on the shell, dude, OK?

1025
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:51,734
Just waxed it.

1026
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:54,005
So, Mr. Turtle...

1027
00:51:54,044 --> 00:51:56,410
Dude. Mr. Turtle is my father.

1028
00:51:56,446 --> 00:51:57,879
The name's Crush.

1029
00:51:57,914 --> 00:52:00,246
Crush? Really?

1030
00:52:00,283 --> 00:52:04,947
OK, Crush. I need to
the East Australian Current.

1031
00:52:04,988 --> 00:52:06,216
E.A.C.?

1032
00:52:06,256 --> 00:52:08,190
Oh, dude.

1033
00:52:08,225 --> 00:52:10,591
You're ridin' it, dude!

1034
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:13,255
Check it out!

1035
00:52:34,184 --> 00:52:36,049
OK, grab shell, dude!

1036
00:52:36,086 --> 00:52:38,454
Grab wh-a-a-at?!

1037
00:52:47,230 --> 00:52:49,892
Righteous! Righteous!

1038
00:52:49,933 --> 00:52:54,670
- Yeah!
- Stop!

1039
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:57,139
So...

1040
00:52:57,173 --> 00:53:00,700
What brings you on this fine day
to the E.A.C.?

1041
00:53:00,744 --> 00:53:03,338
Dory and I need
to get to Sydney.

1042
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:05,610
Dory! Is she all right?

1043
00:53:05,649 --> 00:53:07,446
Oh, little blue.

1044
00:53:08,551 --> 00:53:10,143
She is sub-level, dude.

1045
00:53:14,291 --> 00:53:16,851
Dory! Dory! Dory!

1046
00:53:16,893 --> 00:53:18,622
Dory.

1047
00:53:20,363 --> 00:53:23,196
I'm so sorry.

1048
00:53:23,233 --> 00:53:26,566
This is all my fault.
It's my fault.

1049
00:53:26,603 --> 00:53:31,573
Twenty-nine, thirty!
Ready or not, here I come!

1050
00:53:31,574 --> 00:53:33,599
There you are!

1051
00:53:37,781 --> 00:53:40,147
Dory?

1052
00:53:40,183 --> 00:53:42,014
Nice wave!

1053
00:53:45,822 --> 00:53:47,656
Up you go!

1054
00:53:57,701 --> 00:54:00,295
- Oh, my goodness!
- Kill the motor, dude.

1055
00:54:00,337 --> 00:54:03,670
Let us see what Squirt does
flying solo.

1056
00:54:12,148 --> 00:54:15,140
That was so cool!

1057
00:54:15,185 --> 00:54:16,982
Hey, Dad, did you see that?

1058
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:19,352
Did you see me?
Did you see what I did?

1059
00:54:19,389 --> 00:54:22,358
You so totally rock, Squirt!

1060
00:54:22,392 --> 00:54:23,916
So give me some fin.

1061
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:25,359
Noggin.

1062
00:54:25,395 --> 00:54:26,760
- Dude.
- Dude.

1063
00:54:26,796 --> 00:54:28,195
Oh... intro.

1064
00:54:28,231 --> 00:54:30,131
Jellyman, offspring.

1065
00:54:30,166 --> 00:54:32,225
Offspring, Jellyman.

1066
00:54:32,268 --> 00:54:35,795
- Jellies?! Sweet.
- Totally.

1067
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:39,070
Apparently, I must've done
something you liked... dudes.

1068
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:41,543
You rock, dude!

1069
00:54:41,578 --> 00:54:46,311
Curl away, my son.
It's awesome, Jellyman.

1070
00:54:46,349 --> 00:54:48,010
The little dudes are just eggs.

1071
00:54:48,051 --> 00:54:49,814
We leave 'em
on a beach to hatch...

1072
00:54:49,853 --> 00:54:51,115
and then, coo-coo-cachoo...

1073
00:54:51,154 --> 00:54:53,554
they find their way back
to the big ol' blue.

1074
00:54:53,590 --> 00:54:55,922
- All by themselves?
- Yeah.

1075
00:54:55,959 --> 00:54:58,951
But, dude, how do you know
when they're ready?

1076
00:54:58,995 --> 00:55:00,223
Well, you never really know.

1077
00:55:00,263 --> 00:55:03,664
But when they know,
you'll know, you know? Ha.

1078
00:55:07,904 --> 00:55:09,337
Hey, look, everybody.

1079
00:55:09,372 --> 00:55:12,068
I know that dude!
It's the Jellyman!

1080
00:55:12,108 --> 00:55:14,133
Go on. Jump on him!

1081
00:55:14,177 --> 00:55:17,374
- Turtle pile!
- Wait, wait, wait!

1082
00:55:17,414 --> 00:55:19,473
- Are you funny?
- Where's your shell?

1083
00:55:19,516 --> 00:55:21,575
- I need to breathe!
- Are you running away?

1084
00:55:21,618 --> 00:55:23,279
Did you really cross
the jellyfish forest?

1085
00:55:23,319 --> 00:55:25,287
- Did they sting you?
- One at a time!

1086
00:55:25,321 --> 00:55:26,982
Mr. Fish, did you die?

1087
00:55:27,023 --> 00:55:29,548
Sorry, I was
a little vague on the details.

1088
00:55:29,592 --> 00:55:30,752
So, where are you going?

1089
00:55:30,794 --> 00:55:32,659
You see, my son was taken.

1090
00:55:32,695 --> 00:55:35,528
My son was taken away from me.

1091
00:55:35,565 --> 00:55:37,829
- No way.
- What happened?

1092
00:55:37,867 --> 00:55:40,028
No, no, kids.
I don't want to talk about it.

1093
00:55:40,070 --> 00:55:42,402
Aww! Please?

1094
00:55:42,439 --> 00:55:43,770
Please?

1095
00:55:43,807 --> 00:55:46,542
Well, OK.

1096
00:55:46,543 --> 00:55:50,377
I live on this reef
a long, long way from here.

1097
00:55:50,413 --> 00:55:52,438
This is gonna be good.
I can tell.

1098
00:55:52,482 --> 00:55:54,882
And my son Nemo...

1099
00:55:54,918 --> 00:55:56,886
See, he was mad at me.

1100
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:58,547
And maybe he wouldn't
have done it...

1101
00:55:58,588 --> 00:56:00,078
if I hadn't been
so tough on him.

1102
00:56:00,123 --> 00:56:01,351
I don't know.

1103
00:56:01,391 --> 00:56:03,382
Anyway, he swam out in
the open water to this boat...

1104
00:56:03,426 --> 00:56:06,293
and when he was out there,
these divers appeared...

1105
00:56:06,329 --> 00:56:08,957
and I tried to stop them,
but the boat was too fast.

1106
00:56:08,998 --> 00:56:10,761
So, we swam out in the ocean
to follow them...

1107
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:13,132
They couldn't stop 'em.
And then Nemo's dad...

1108
00:56:13,169 --> 00:56:15,933
he swims out to the ocean,
and they bump into...

1109
00:56:15,972 --> 00:56:17,269
three ferocious sharks.

1110
00:56:17,307 --> 00:56:19,400
He scares away the sharks
by blowing 'em up!

1111
00:56:19,442 --> 00:56:20,773
Golly, that's amazing.

1112
00:56:20,810 --> 00:56:22,437
And then dives
thousands of feet...

1113
00:56:22,479 --> 00:56:24,208
straight down into the dark.

1114
00:56:24,247 --> 00:56:25,714
It's wicked dark down there.

1115
00:56:25,748 --> 00:56:27,443
You can't see a thing.
How's it going, Bob?

1116
00:56:27,484 --> 00:56:29,145
And the only thing
they can see down there...

1117
00:56:29,185 --> 00:56:30,914
is the light from
this big, horrible creature...

1118
00:56:30,954 --> 00:56:32,922
with razor-sharp teeth.
Nice parry, old man.

1119
00:56:32,956 --> 00:56:34,321
And then he has
to blast his way...

1120
00:56:34,357 --> 00:56:35,984
So, these two little fish
have been...

1121
00:56:36,025 --> 00:56:39,561
searching the ocean for days
on the East Australian Current.

1122
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:41,894
Which means that he may be
on his way here right now.

1123
00:56:41,931 --> 00:56:43,455
That should put him
in Sydney Harbor...

1124
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:44,797
In a matter of days.
I mean, it sounds like...

1125
00:56:44,834 --> 00:56:46,825
this guy is gonna
stop at nothing...

1126
00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:49,634
till he finds his son.
I sure hope he makes it.

1127
00:56:49,672 --> 00:56:52,664
That's one dedicated father,
if you ask me.

1128
00:56:58,281 --> 00:57:00,215
Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!

1129
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:05,552
Mine! Mine! Mine!
Mine! Mine! Mine!

1130
00:57:05,588 --> 00:57:07,283
Mine! Mine! Mine!
Mine! Mine! Mine!

1131
00:57:07,323 --> 00:57:10,724
Would you just shut up?!

1132
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:12,227
You're rats with wings!

1133
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:13,752
Bloke's been looking
for his boy Nemo.

1134
00:57:13,796 --> 00:57:16,128
- Nemo?!
- He was taken off the reef...

1135
00:57:16,166 --> 00:57:19,192
- Take it! You happy?
- Mine! Mine! Mine!

1136
00:57:19,235 --> 00:57:22,033
Hey, say that again!
Something about Nemo.

1137
00:57:22,071 --> 00:57:23,231
Mine! Mine! Mine!

1138
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:24,763
Whoooa...

1139
00:57:26,009 --> 00:57:27,567
Mine?

1140
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:29,840
Last I heard, he's heading
towards the harbor.

1141
00:57:29,879 --> 00:57:32,313
Brilliant!

1142
00:57:45,195 --> 00:57:47,196
Is he doing OK?

1143
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:50,460
Whatever you do,
Don't mention D-a-r...

1144
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:53,367
It's OK. I know who
you're talking about.

1145
00:58:01,377 --> 00:58:02,708
Gill?

1146
00:58:05,181 --> 00:58:06,910
Gill?

1147
00:58:06,950 --> 00:58:09,612
Hey, Sharkbait.

1148
00:58:09,652 --> 00:58:11,882
I'm sorry I couldn't stop the...

1149
00:58:11,921 --> 00:58:14,082
No, I'm the one
who should be sorry.

1150
00:58:14,123 --> 00:58:16,751
I was so ready to get out...

1151
00:58:16,793 --> 00:58:19,557
so ready to taste that ocean...

1152
00:58:19,596 --> 00:58:23,032
I was willing to put you
in harm's way to get there.

1153
00:58:23,066 --> 00:58:27,025
Nothing should be worth that.

1154
00:58:27,070 --> 00:58:30,301
I'm sorry I couldn't get you
back to your father, kid.

1155
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:36,911
All right. Hey, hey, hey...

1156
00:58:36,946 --> 00:58:38,573
What the...

1157
00:58:38,615 --> 00:58:42,346
That's one way to pull a tooth.

1158
00:58:42,385 --> 00:58:44,478
Darn kids.

1159
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:47,512
Good thing I pulled the
right one, eh, Prime Minister?

1160
00:58:47,557 --> 00:58:49,115
Hey.

1161
00:58:49,158 --> 00:58:51,149
Oh, Nigel!
You just missed an extraction.

1162
00:58:51,194 --> 00:58:53,822
Has he loosened
the periodontal ligament yet?

1163
00:58:53,863 --> 00:58:55,922
What am I talking about?
Where's Nemo?

1164
00:58:56,032 --> 00:58:58,296
- I've got to speak with him.
- What is it?

1165
00:58:58,334 --> 00:59:00,427
Your dad's been fighting
the entire ocean...

1166
00:59:00,470 --> 00:59:03,098
- looking for you.
- My father? Really?

1167
00:59:03,139 --> 00:59:07,269
He's traveled hundreds of miles,
battling sharks and jellyfish...

1168
00:59:07,310 --> 00:59:09,801
Sharks? That can't be him.

1169
00:59:09,846 --> 00:59:12,440
What was his name?
Some sort of sport fish.

1170
00:59:12,482 --> 00:59:14,643
- Tuna? Trout?
- Marlin?

1171
00:59:14,684 --> 00:59:16,515
Marlin! The little clownfish
from the reef.

1172
00:59:16,552 --> 00:59:19,146
It's my dad!
He took on a shark!

1173
00:59:19,188 --> 00:59:21,520
I heard he took on three.

1174
00:59:21,557 --> 00:59:24,390
- Three sharks?
- That's 4,800 teeth!

1175
00:59:24,427 --> 00:59:26,520
After you were taken
by Diver Dan over there...

1176
00:59:26,562 --> 00:59:28,792
your dad followed the boat
like a maniac.

1177
00:59:28,831 --> 00:59:30,196
Really?

1178
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:32,030
He's swimming,
giving it all he's got...

1179
00:59:32,068 --> 00:59:34,127
and then three gigantic
sharks capture him...

1180
00:59:34,170 --> 00:59:36,434
and he blows them up
and dives thousands of feet...

1181
00:59:36,472 --> 00:59:39,305
and gets chased by a monster
with huge teeth!

1182
00:59:39,342 --> 00:59:41,970
He ties this demon to a rock,
and what's his reward?

1183
00:59:42,011 --> 00:59:44,377
He gets to battle
an entire jellyfish forest!

1184
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:47,611
Now he's with a bunch of
sea turtles on the E.A. C...

1185
00:59:47,650 --> 00:59:51,142
and the word is he's headed
this way right now... to Sydney!

1186
00:59:51,187 --> 00:59:52,552
What a good daddy!

1187
00:59:52,588 --> 00:59:55,148
He was looking for you
after all, Sharkbait.

1188
00:59:58,661 --> 01:00:00,288
He's swimming to the filter!

1189
01:00:00,330 --> 01:00:01,820
- Sharkbait!
- Not again!

1190
01:00:03,366 --> 01:00:06,301
Sharkbait!

1191
01:00:06,336 --> 01:00:07,701
No!

1192
01:00:07,737 --> 01:00:08,931
You got your whole life
ahead of you!

1193
01:00:08,971 --> 01:00:11,371
- We'll help you, kid!
- Get him out!

1194
01:00:15,678 --> 01:00:17,339
Get him out of there!

1195
01:00:17,380 --> 01:00:19,007
Come on, kid! Grab the end!

1196
01:00:19,048 --> 01:00:21,642
Sharkbait!

1197
01:00:21,684 --> 01:00:23,709
- No!
- Can you hear me?

1198
01:00:23,753 --> 01:00:25,243
Nemo! Can you hear me?

1199
01:00:25,288 --> 01:00:27,313
Yeah, I can hear you.

1200
01:00:27,357 --> 01:00:29,291
Sharkbait, you did it!

1201
01:00:29,325 --> 01:00:33,125
Sharkbait, you're...
covered with germs!

1202
01:00:33,162 --> 01:00:35,230
That took guts, kid.

1203
01:00:35,231 --> 01:00:37,722
All right, gang,
we have less than 48 hours...

1204
01:00:37,767 --> 01:00:39,064
before Darla gets here.

1205
01:00:39,102 --> 01:00:40,797
This tank'll get
plenty dirty in that time...

1206
01:00:40,837 --> 01:00:43,670
but we have to help it along
any way we can.

1207
01:00:43,706 --> 01:00:45,970
- Jacques? No cleaning.
- I shall resist.

1208
01:00:46,008 --> 01:00:48,670
Everybody else,
be as gross as possible.

1209
01:00:48,711 --> 01:00:49,939
Think dirty thoughts.

1210
01:00:49,979 --> 01:00:52,174
We're gonna make
this tank so filthy...

1211
01:00:52,215 --> 01:00:54,740
the dentist
will have to clean it.

1212
01:00:54,784 --> 01:00:56,877
Good work!

1213
01:01:03,426 --> 01:01:05,951
All right, we're here, dudes!

1214
01:01:05,995 --> 01:01:09,192
Get ready!
Your exit's coming up, man!

1215
01:01:09,232 --> 01:01:10,722
Where? I don't see it!

1216
01:01:10,767 --> 01:01:13,201
Right there!
I see it! I see it!

1217
01:01:13,236 --> 01:01:16,364
The swirling vortex of terror?

1218
01:01:16,406 --> 01:01:18,704
- That's it, dude.
- Of course it is.

1219
01:01:18,741 --> 01:01:22,768
OK, first,
find your exit buddy.

1220
01:01:22,812 --> 01:01:25,303
Do you have your exit buddy?

1221
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:26,576
Yes!

1222
01:01:26,616 --> 01:01:31,349
Squirt give you a rundown
of proper exiting technique.

1223
01:01:31,387 --> 01:01:34,914
Good afternoon!
We'll have a great jump today!

1224
01:01:34,957 --> 01:01:38,654
OK, crank a hard cutback
as you hit the wall.

1225
01:01:38,694 --> 01:01:41,629
There's a screaming bottom turn,
so watch out!

1226
01:01:41,664 --> 01:01:44,929
Remember...
rip it, roll it, and punch it!

1227
01:01:44,967 --> 01:01:48,095
He's trying to speak to me,
I know it!

1228
01:01:48,137 --> 01:01:51,368
You're really cute, but I don't
know what you're saying!

1229
01:01:51,407 --> 01:01:52,669
Say the first thing again.

1230
01:01:52,708 --> 01:01:55,233
OK, Jellyman! Go, go, go!

1231
01:02:09,592 --> 01:02:12,186
That was... fun!

1232
01:02:12,228 --> 01:02:14,492
I actually enjoyed that.

1233
01:02:14,530 --> 01:02:16,157
Hey, look, turtles!

1234
01:02:16,199 --> 01:02:19,134
Most excellent!

1235
01:02:19,168 --> 01:02:20,931
Now turn your
fishy tails around...

1236
01:02:20,970 --> 01:02:24,167
and swim straight on
through to Sydney!

1237
01:02:24,207 --> 01:02:26,368
No worries, man!

1238
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:28,468
No worries!
Thank you, dude Crush!

1239
01:02:28,511 --> 01:02:31,071
- Bye!
- Bye, Jellyman!

1240
01:02:31,113 --> 01:02:33,411
You tell your little dude
I said hi, OK?

1241
01:02:33,449 --> 01:02:34,609
See ya later, dudes!

1242
01:02:34,650 --> 01:02:36,379
Bye, everyone!

1243
01:02:36,419 --> 01:02:38,751
Nemo would have loved this.

1244
01:02:38,788 --> 01:02:42,121
Hey! Crush, I forgot!

1245
01:02:42,158 --> 01:02:43,716
How old are you?

1246
01:02:43,759 --> 01:02:47,957
150, dude!
And still young! Rock on!

1247
01:02:47,997 --> 01:02:52,024
150! 150!
I gotta remember that.

1248
01:02:58,074 --> 01:03:00,702
- We going in there?
- Yep.

1249
01:03:00,743 --> 01:03:02,802
P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney?

1250
01:03:02,845 --> 01:03:08,477
Yep. We're gonna
just swim straight.

1251
01:03:08,518 --> 01:03:11,282
Just keep swimming,
just keep swimming

1252
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:12,480
Dory...

1253
01:03:21,264 --> 01:03:23,892
Boy, this is taking awhile.

1254
01:03:23,933 --> 01:03:25,628
How about we play a game?

1255
01:03:25,668 --> 01:03:26,930
OK.

1256
01:03:26,969 --> 01:03:30,029
OK, I'm thinking
of something orange...

1257
01:03:30,072 --> 01:03:31,562
and it's small...

1258
01:03:31,607 --> 01:03:33,905
- It's me.
- Right!

1259
01:03:33,943 --> 01:03:37,504
It's orange and small...

1260
01:03:37,547 --> 01:03:38,844
It's me.

1261
01:03:38,881 --> 01:03:40,781
All righty, Mr. Smartypants.

1262
01:03:40,816 --> 01:03:43,984
And it's orange and small
and white stripes...

1263
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:46,250
Me. And the next one,
just a guess, me.

1264
01:03:46,289 --> 01:03:48,814
- That's just scary.
- Wait, wait, wait.

1265
01:03:48,858 --> 01:03:50,689
I have definitely seen
this floating speck before.

1266
01:03:50,726 --> 01:03:52,250
That means
we've passed it before...

1267
01:03:52,295 --> 01:03:53,660
and that means
we're going in circles...

1268
01:03:53,696 --> 01:03:55,254
and that means
we're not going straight!

1269
01:03:55,364 --> 01:03:57,457
- Hey, hey!
- Get to the surface.

1270
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:59,092
We'll figure it out
up there. Let's go!

1271
01:03:59,135 --> 01:04:01,330
- Hey! Relax.
- What?

1272
01:04:01,370 --> 01:04:03,964
Take a deep breath.

1273
01:04:05,908 --> 01:04:08,209
Now, let's ask somebody
for directions.

1274
01:04:08,244 --> 01:04:10,269
Fine. Who do you
want to ask, the speck?

1275
01:04:10,313 --> 01:04:12,679
- There's nobody here!
- There has to be someone.

1276
01:04:12,715 --> 01:04:15,582
It's the ocean, silly.
We're not the only two in here.

1277
01:04:15,618 --> 01:04:17,950
Let's see. OK, no one there.

1278
01:04:17,987 --> 01:04:22,447
Nope. Nada.

1279
01:04:23,859 --> 01:04:25,656
There's somebody.
Hey! Excuse...

1280
01:04:25,695 --> 01:04:27,526
Dory, Dory, Dory!
Now it's my turn.

1281
01:04:27,563 --> 01:04:29,155
I'm thinking of something
dark and mysterious.

1282
01:04:29,198 --> 01:04:31,564
It's a fish we don't know.
If we ask it directions...

1283
01:04:31,601 --> 01:04:33,626
it could ingest us
and spit out our bones!

1284
01:04:33,669 --> 01:04:36,137
What is it with men
and asking for directions?

1285
01:04:36,172 --> 01:04:37,969
I don't want to play
the gender card right now.

1286
01:04:38,007 --> 01:04:39,941
Let's play
the "Let's Not Die" card.

1287
01:04:39,976 --> 01:04:41,876
- You want to get out of here?
- Of course I do.

1288
01:04:41,911 --> 01:04:45,176
How are we gonna do that
unless we give it a shot?

1289
01:04:45,214 --> 01:04:47,205
Dory, you don't
fully understand...

1290
01:04:47,249 --> 01:04:49,240
Come on. Trust me on this.

1291
01:04:57,326 --> 01:05:01,162
All right.

1292
01:05:01,163 --> 01:05:04,428
Excuse me! Little fella?

1293
01:05:04,467 --> 01:05:08,403
Hello! Don't be rude. Say Hi.

1294
01:05:08,437 --> 01:05:10,462
Ha. Hello.

1295
01:05:10,506 --> 01:05:12,030
- His son Bingo...
- Nemo.

1296
01:05:12,074 --> 01:05:15,100
- Nemo was taken to...
- Sydney.

1297
01:05:15,144 --> 01:05:18,341
Sydney! And it's
really, really important...

1298
01:05:18,381 --> 01:05:20,315
that we get there
as fast as we can...

1299
01:05:20,349 --> 01:05:22,442
so can you help us out?

1300
01:05:22,485 --> 01:05:26,012
Come on, little fella. Come on.

1301
01:05:26,055 --> 01:05:29,286
Dory, I'm a little fella.

1302
01:05:29,325 --> 01:05:32,827
I don't think
that's a little fella.

1303
01:05:32,828 --> 01:05:36,730
Oh! Big fella. Whale. OK.

1304
01:05:36,766 --> 01:05:39,234
Maybe he only speaks whale.

1305
01:05:39,268 --> 01:05:42,499
Mooo! Weee neeed...

1306
01:05:42,538 --> 01:05:46,634
- Dory?
- Tooo fiind his son.

1307
01:05:46,676 --> 01:05:49,338
What are you doing?
Are you sure you speak whale?

1308
01:05:49,378 --> 01:05:52,746
Can youuuu give us
diiirectionsss?

1309
01:05:52,815 --> 01:05:55,147
Dory! Heaven knows
what you're saying!

1310
01:05:55,184 --> 01:05:58,779
- See, he's swimming away.
- Cooome baaack.

1311
01:05:58,821 --> 01:06:01,085
He's not coming back.
You offended him.

1312
01:06:01,123 --> 01:06:02,317
Maybe a different dialect.

1313
01:06:02,358 --> 01:06:05,555
Dory!

1314
01:06:05,594 --> 01:06:08,859
This is not whale.
You're speaking upset stomach.

1315
01:06:08,898 --> 01:06:11,098
- Maybe I should try humpback.
- Don't.

1316
01:06:12,635 --> 01:06:15,604
- You actually sound sick.
- Maybe louder?

1317
01:06:15,638 --> 01:06:17,105
- Rah! Rah!
- Don't do that!

1318
01:06:17,139 --> 01:06:18,868
Too much orca.
Didn't it sound orca-ish?

1319
01:06:18,908 --> 01:06:20,239
It doesn't sound orca.

1320
01:06:20,276 --> 01:06:22,073
It sounds like nothing
I've ever heard.

1321
01:06:24,647 --> 01:06:26,514
It's just as well.
He might be hungry.

1322
01:06:26,615 --> 01:06:29,607
Whales don't eat clownfish.
They eat krill.

1323
01:06:29,652 --> 01:06:33,179
- Swim away!
- Oh, look, krill!

1324
01:06:34,590 --> 01:06:38,060
Move, Dory, move!

1325
01:06:44,166 --> 01:06:46,930
Look at that.
Would you look at that?

1326
01:06:46,969 --> 01:06:50,928
Filthy. Absolutely filthy.

1327
01:06:50,973 --> 01:06:53,965
All thanks to you, kid.
You made it possible.

1328
01:06:54,009 --> 01:06:56,034
Jacques, I said no cleaning.

1329
01:06:56,145 --> 01:06:57,908
I am ashamed.

1330
01:06:57,947 --> 01:07:00,415
Look! Scum angel!

1331
01:07:04,620 --> 01:07:06,554
Bubbles! I love the bubbles!

1332
01:07:08,624 --> 01:07:12,253
Flo? Has anybody seen Flo?

1333
01:07:12,294 --> 01:07:14,922
9:00 and cue dentist.

1334
01:07:14,964 --> 01:07:17,228
Hello, Barbara. Sorry I'm late.

1335
01:07:17,266 --> 01:07:19,962
OK, here we go. Here we go, OK.

1336
01:07:20,002 --> 01:07:21,731
Little Davey Reynolds...

1337
01:07:21,771 --> 01:07:23,363
Walks to the counter,
drops the keys...

1338
01:07:23,405 --> 01:07:25,498
Bloat, that's disgusting!

1339
01:07:25,541 --> 01:07:27,566
Tastes pretty good to me.

1340
01:07:27,610 --> 01:07:29,373
- Urrrp!
- Eww!

1341
01:07:29,411 --> 01:07:32,278
Don't you people realize
we are swimming in our own...

1342
01:07:32,314 --> 01:07:33,406
Here he comes!

1343
01:07:35,451 --> 01:07:38,750
Crikey. What a state.

1344
01:07:40,222 --> 01:07:44,352
Barbara, what's my earliest
appointment tomorrow?

1345
01:07:44,393 --> 01:07:47,328
- 10:00, luv.
- Leave it open, would you?

1346
01:07:47,363 --> 01:07:49,695
I've gotta clean the fish tank
before Darla gets here.

1347
01:07:49,732 --> 01:07:51,825
Did you hear that, Sharkbait?

1348
01:07:51,867 --> 01:07:55,564
Yay! He's gonna clean the tank!

1349
01:07:55,604 --> 01:07:57,367
We're gonna be clean!

1350
01:07:57,406 --> 01:07:59,067
You ready to see your dad, kid?

1351
01:07:59,108 --> 01:08:01,042
Of course you are.

1352
01:08:01,076 --> 01:08:03,704
I wouldn't be surprised
if he's out there...

1353
01:08:03,746 --> 01:08:06,913
in the harbor
waiting for you right now.

1354
01:08:07,016 --> 01:08:09,382
Yeah.

1355
01:09:24,386 --> 01:09:26,115
Here comes the big one.

1356
01:09:26,154 --> 01:09:28,679
Come on! You gotta try this!

1357
01:09:28,724 --> 01:09:31,989
- Will you just stop it?
- Why? What's wrong?

1358
01:09:32,027 --> 01:09:34,325
We're in a whale,
don't you get it?

1359
01:09:34,363 --> 01:09:35,523
- Whale?
- A whale!

1360
01:09:35,564 --> 01:09:38,294
You had to ask for help!
And now we're stuck here!

1361
01:09:38,333 --> 01:09:41,097
A whale. I speak whale.

1362
01:09:41,136 --> 01:09:43,468
No, you're insane!
You can't speak whale!

1363
01:09:43,505 --> 01:09:46,702
I have to get out!
I have to find my son!

1364
01:09:46,742 --> 01:09:52,146
I have to tell him
how old sea turtles are!

1365
01:10:03,158 --> 01:10:05,991
Hey...

1366
01:10:06,028 --> 01:10:08,292
you OK?

1367
01:10:14,369 --> 01:10:17,361
There, there. It's all right.

1368
01:10:17,406 --> 01:10:19,340
It'll be OK.

1369
01:10:19,374 --> 01:10:21,604
No. No, it won't.

1370
01:10:21,643 --> 01:10:23,873
Sure it will. You'll see.

1371
01:10:23,912 --> 01:10:30,044
No. I promised him I'd never
let anything happen to him.

1372
01:10:30,085 --> 01:10:33,486
That's a funny thing
to promise.

1373
01:10:33,522 --> 01:10:34,887
What?

1374
01:10:34,923 --> 01:10:37,357
You can't never let
anything happen to him.

1375
01:10:37,392 --> 01:10:39,826
Then nothing
would ever happen to him.

1376
01:10:42,864 --> 01:10:45,628
Not much fun for little Harpo.

1377
01:10:54,476 --> 01:10:56,307
What's going on?

1378
01:10:56,345 --> 01:10:58,643
Don't know. I'll ask him.

1379
01:11:01,183 --> 01:11:07,213
- Dory...
- Whaaat's goooing onnn?

1380
01:11:13,261 --> 01:11:14,853
I think he says we've stopped.

1381
01:11:14,896 --> 01:11:18,161
Of course we've stopped.
Stop trying to speak whale.

1382
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:20,998
You'll make things worse.
What is that noise?

1383
01:11:25,107 --> 01:11:27,905
Oh, no. Look what you did.

1384
01:11:27,943 --> 01:11:32,903
The water's going down.
It's going down!

1385
01:11:36,618 --> 01:11:38,051
Really? You sure about that?

1386
01:11:38,086 --> 01:11:40,145
Look! Already it's half empty!

1387
01:11:40,188 --> 01:11:41,951
I'd say it's half full.

1388
01:11:41,990 --> 01:11:43,457
Stop that! It's half empty!

1389
01:11:46,528 --> 01:11:49,725
OK, that one
was a little tougher.

1390
01:11:49,765 --> 01:11:52,634
He either said we should go
to the back of the throat...

1391
01:11:52,701 --> 01:11:54,862
or he wants a root beer float.

1392
01:11:54,903 --> 01:11:56,530
Of course he wants us
to go there!

1393
01:11:56,571 --> 01:11:58,505
That's eating us!

1394
01:11:58,540 --> 01:12:01,509
How do I taste, Moby?
Do I taste good?

1395
01:12:01,543 --> 01:12:03,807
Tell him I'm not interested
in being lunch!

1396
01:12:03,845 --> 01:12:06,313
- OK. Heee...
- Stop talking to him!

1397
01:12:12,487 --> 01:12:13,647
What is going on?

1398
01:12:13,689 --> 01:12:15,987
I'll check. Whaaat...

1399
01:12:16,024 --> 01:12:18,788
No more whale!
You can't speak whale!

1400
01:12:18,827 --> 01:12:21,159
- Yes, I can!
- No, you can't!

1401
01:12:21,196 --> 01:12:24,757
You think you can do these
things, but you can't, Nemo!

1402
01:12:29,771 --> 01:12:32,604
- OK.
- Dory! Oof!

1403
01:12:35,177 --> 01:12:38,772
He says it's time to let go.

1404
01:12:38,814 --> 01:12:40,782
Everything's gonna be
all right.

1405
01:12:40,816 --> 01:12:42,477
How do you know?

1406
01:12:42,517 --> 01:12:45,611
How do you know something bad
isn't gonna happen?

1407
01:12:45,654 --> 01:12:47,554
I don't!

1408
01:13:08,176 --> 01:13:12,943
We're alive!

1409
01:13:14,015 --> 01:13:16,882
Look! Sy-d-ney... Sydney!

1410
01:13:16,918 --> 01:13:19,352
Sydney! Sydney again!

1411
01:13:21,356 --> 01:13:23,824
You were right, Dory!
We made it!

1412
01:13:23,859 --> 01:13:26,794
We're gonna find my son!

1413
01:13:29,364 --> 01:13:32,798
Thaaank yoouuu, sirrr!

1414
01:13:32,901 --> 01:13:35,369
I wish I could speak whale.

1415
01:13:35,403 --> 01:13:37,701
All we gotta do is find
the boat that took him.

1416
01:13:37,739 --> 01:13:40,833
- Right!
- We can do this!

1417
01:13:54,456 --> 01:13:56,754
Morning.

1418
01:13:56,792 --> 01:14:00,057
It's morning, everyone!
Today's the day!

1419
01:14:00,095 --> 01:14:02,256
The sun is shining,
the tank is clean...

1420
01:14:02,297 --> 01:14:05,357
and we are getting out...
The tank is clean.

1421
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:07,960
The tank is clean!

1422
01:14:08,003 --> 01:14:09,595
But how?

1423
01:14:09,638 --> 01:14:12,334
Boss must've installed it
while we were sleeping.

1424
01:14:12,374 --> 01:14:15,832
- What are we gonna do?
- What's it say, Peach?

1425
01:14:17,212 --> 01:14:18,543
I can't hear you, Peach.

1426
01:14:18,580 --> 01:14:21,014
The Aquascum 2003 is
an all-purpose, self-cleaning...

1427
01:14:21,049 --> 01:14:23,017
maintenance-free,
salt water purifier...

1428
01:14:23,051 --> 01:14:26,043
that is guaranteed to extend
the life of your aquarium fish.

1429
01:14:26,087 --> 01:14:27,315
Stop it!

1430
01:14:27,355 --> 01:14:28,845
The Aquascum
is programmed to scan...

1431
01:14:28,890 --> 01:14:31,188
your tank environment
every five minutes?!

1432
01:14:31,226 --> 01:14:32,921
Scan? What does that mean?

1433
01:14:37,799 --> 01:14:39,300
Temperature... 82 degrees...

1434
01:14:39,401 --> 01:14:41,062
PH balance... normal.

1435
01:14:41,102 --> 01:14:43,502
Nice.

1436
01:14:43,538 --> 01:14:48,100
Curse you, Aquascum!

1437
01:14:48,143 --> 01:14:50,236
That's it for the escape plan.
It's ruined.

1438
01:14:50,278 --> 01:14:51,711
Then what are
we gonna do about...

1439
01:14:51,746 --> 01:14:53,714
Darla!

1440
01:14:53,782 --> 01:14:56,376
Stay down, kid!

1441
01:14:56,418 --> 01:14:58,386
False alarm.

1442
01:14:58,420 --> 01:15:00,513
My nerves can't take
much more of this.

1443
01:15:00,555 --> 01:15:02,785
What'll we do
when that brat gets here?

1444
01:15:02,824 --> 01:15:05,054
- I'm thinking.
- Oh! Gill!

1445
01:15:05,093 --> 01:15:08,256
- Nemo! I'm coming!
- Help me! Help me!

1446
01:15:08,296 --> 01:15:12,198
Swim down! Come on, kid!

1447
01:15:12,234 --> 01:15:13,724
- Everybody jump in!
- Swim down!

1448
01:15:13,768 --> 01:15:15,065
- That's it!
- What the...?

1449
01:15:15,103 --> 01:15:18,368
- Yay!
- Good work!

1450
01:15:18,406 --> 01:15:19,930
Gill!

1451
01:15:19,975 --> 01:15:21,567
- Nemo!
- Sharkbait!

1452
01:15:21,610 --> 01:15:25,011
- Roll, kid!
- Lean! Lean!

1453
01:15:29,484 --> 01:15:31,918
Whoops.
That would've been a nasty fall.

1454
01:15:31,953 --> 01:15:34,547
Gill! Don't let me go belly-up!

1455
01:15:34,589 --> 01:15:36,887
Just calm down, Nemo.
You won't go belly-up.

1456
01:15:36,925 --> 01:15:39,325
I promise. You're gonna be OK.

1457
01:15:42,297 --> 01:15:44,322
Darla!

1458
01:15:47,802 --> 01:15:51,533
Do any of these boats
look familiar to you?

1459
01:15:51,573 --> 01:15:53,473
No, but the boat
has to be here somewhere.

1460
01:15:53,508 --> 01:15:55,635
Come on, Dory.
We're gonna find it.

1461
01:15:55,677 --> 01:15:58,407
I'm totally excited.
Are you excited?

1462
01:15:58,446 --> 01:16:00,209
Dory, wake up.
Wake up, come on.

1463
01:16:00,248 --> 01:16:02,079
Duck!

1464
01:16:02,117 --> 01:16:05,518
That's not a duck.
It's a... pelican!

1465
01:16:14,863 --> 01:16:18,128
No! I didn't come this far
to be breakfast!

1466
01:16:25,640 --> 01:16:28,108
Hey, Nigel.
Would you look at that?

1467
01:16:28,143 --> 01:16:29,508
What? What?

1468
01:16:29,544 --> 01:16:32,411
Sun's barely up and Gerald's
had more than he can handle.

1469
01:16:32,447 --> 01:16:35,075
Yeah. Reckon somebody
ought to help the poor guy.

1470
01:16:35,116 --> 01:16:37,107
Yeah, right. Yeah.

1471
01:16:37,152 --> 01:16:40,781
Don't everybody
fly off at once.

1472
01:16:43,892 --> 01:16:46,827
All right, Gerald.
Fish got your tongue?

1473
01:16:46,861 --> 01:16:49,764
Love a duck!

1474
01:16:49,864 --> 01:16:51,559
I gotta find my son Nemo!

1475
01:16:51,599 --> 01:16:54,693
Nemo? He's that fish!

1476
01:16:54,736 --> 01:16:57,296
The one that's been fighting
the whole ocean!

1477
01:16:57,339 --> 01:16:59,807
I know where your son...

1478
01:17:01,443 --> 01:17:03,138
Wait! Come back! Stop!

1479
01:17:03,178 --> 01:17:05,408
Dory, keep going! He's crazy!

1480
01:17:05,447 --> 01:17:07,210
I got something to tell you!

1481
01:17:11,553 --> 01:17:13,043
Mine.

1482
01:17:17,125 --> 01:17:20,652
Don't make any sudden moves.

1483
01:17:20,695 --> 01:17:24,961
Hop inside my mouth
if you want to live.

1484
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:28,629
Hop in your mouth?
How does that make me live?

1485
01:17:28,670 --> 01:17:29,830
Mine?

1486
01:17:29,871 --> 01:17:33,505
Because
I can take you to your son.

1487
01:17:33,541 --> 01:17:36,203
- Yeah, right.
- No. I know your son.

1488
01:17:36,244 --> 01:17:38,940
He's orange with
a gimpy fin on one side.

1489
01:17:38,980 --> 01:17:40,140
That's Nemo!

1490
01:17:40,181 --> 01:17:42,843
Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!

1491
01:17:44,386 --> 01:17:46,877
Fasten your seat belts!

1492
01:17:48,023 --> 01:17:50,150
Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!

1493
01:17:50,225 --> 01:17:52,250
Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!

1494
01:18:08,576 --> 01:18:10,771
Everybody hold on!

1495
01:18:14,149 --> 01:18:16,640
Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!

1496
01:18:22,757 --> 01:18:25,385
Too loud! Too loud for me!

1497
01:18:25,427 --> 01:18:27,657
Twinkle, twinkle, little star

1498
01:18:27,695 --> 01:18:30,562
Find a happy place!
Find a happy place!

1499
01:18:30,598 --> 01:18:33,123
Darla, your uncle
will see you now.

1500
01:18:35,170 --> 01:18:37,695
All right, let's see
those pearly whites.

1501
01:18:37,739 --> 01:18:42,039
Raah! I'm a piranha.
They're in the Amazon.

1502
01:18:42,077 --> 01:18:45,513
And a piranha's a fish,
just like your present.

1503
01:18:46,881 --> 01:18:48,644
I get fishy, fishy

1504
01:18:48,683 --> 01:18:51,777
Oh, no. Poor little guy.

1505
01:18:51,820 --> 01:18:53,651
- He's dead.
- Sharkbait!

1506
01:18:53,688 --> 01:18:54,882
Yay! Fishy, fishy, fishy!

1507
01:18:54,923 --> 01:18:56,515
Must've left your present
in the car, sweetie.

1508
01:18:56,558 --> 01:18:58,856
I'll go and get it.

1509
01:18:58,893 --> 01:19:00,622
- He's still alive!
- He's not dead!

1510
01:19:00,662 --> 01:19:02,687
What's happening?
Why is he playing dead?

1511
01:19:02,730 --> 01:19:04,595
He's gonna get flushed
down the toilet.

1512
01:19:04,632 --> 01:19:07,032
- He's gonna get out of here!
- He's gonna get flushed!

1513
01:19:07,068 --> 01:19:08,831
What a smart little guy!

1514
01:19:08,870 --> 01:19:10,428
Oh, no! Not the trash can!

1515
01:19:10,472 --> 01:19:11,769
Nemo! No!

1516
01:19:11,806 --> 01:19:15,207
- Hey! I found his dad!
- Where's Nemo?

1517
01:19:15,243 --> 01:19:16,608
- Dentist!
- He's over there!

1518
01:19:16,644 --> 01:19:20,045
What's a dentist?
Nigel, get in there!

1519
01:19:20,081 --> 01:19:24,040
- I can't go in there!
- Yes, you can! Charge!

1520
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:27,044
What the...?

1521
01:19:28,323 --> 01:19:30,917
Darla, sweetie, look out!

1522
01:19:34,329 --> 01:19:36,490
Hold still!

1523
01:19:36,531 --> 01:19:38,465
Easy! Easy!

1524
01:19:39,767 --> 01:19:40,995
Hold still!

1525
01:19:41,035 --> 01:19:44,198
Nobody's going to hurt you!
Oof!

1526
01:19:50,278 --> 01:19:52,678
Nemo.

1527
01:19:52,714 --> 01:19:53,976
Oh, my goodness.

1528
01:19:54,015 --> 01:19:55,915
Gotcha! Keep down!

1529
01:19:55,950 --> 01:19:57,212
Nemo!

1530
01:19:57,252 --> 01:19:58,981
Daddy?

1531
01:19:59,020 --> 01:20:02,854
Out with you! And stay out!

1532
01:20:02,891 --> 01:20:04,222
Daddy?

1533
01:20:04,259 --> 01:20:05,658
Fishy?

1534
01:20:05,693 --> 01:20:08,821
Fishy! Wake up!

1535
01:20:08,863 --> 01:20:10,023
Oh, no!

1536
01:20:10,064 --> 01:20:12,589
To the top of
Mount Wannahockaloogie!

1537
01:20:12,634 --> 01:20:15,034
Why are you sleeping?

1538
01:20:15,069 --> 01:20:17,503
- Hurry!
- Bloat!

1539
01:20:20,575 --> 01:20:22,668
Ring of Fire!

1540
01:20:23,678 --> 01:20:27,239
Fishy!

1541
01:20:28,716 --> 01:20:30,775
Crikey! All the animals
have gone mad!

1542
01:20:32,587 --> 01:20:35,147
Aaah! Get it out!

1543
01:20:35,190 --> 01:20:37,750
- Smack her in the head!
- Go, Gill, go!

1544
01:20:37,792 --> 01:20:39,783
Fish in my hair!

1545
01:20:39,827 --> 01:20:41,192
Gill!

1546
01:20:41,229 --> 01:20:45,723
Sharkbait...
tell your dad I said hi.

1547
01:20:50,772 --> 01:20:52,034
Go get 'em!

1548
01:20:57,045 --> 01:20:58,774
- He did it!
- Yay!

1549
01:20:58,813 --> 01:21:01,748
- I'm so happy!
- Is he gonna be OK, Gill?

1550
01:21:01,783 --> 01:21:04,013
Don't worry.
All drains lead to the ocean.

1551
01:21:04,052 --> 01:21:05,781
Fishy!

1552
01:21:13,328 --> 01:21:15,660
Daddy!

1553
01:21:51,466 --> 01:21:54,299
I'm so sorry.

1554
01:21:55,470 --> 01:21:56,937
Truly, I am.

1555
01:21:56,938 --> 01:21:57,768
Truly, I am.

1556
01:22:15,123 --> 01:22:17,318
- Hey.
- Dory...

1557
01:22:17,358 --> 01:22:19,417
if it wasn't for you...

1558
01:22:19,460 --> 01:22:22,258
I never would've even
made it here.

1559
01:22:22,297 --> 01:22:24,288
So, thank you.

1560
01:22:26,401 --> 01:22:28,130
Hey, wait a minute.

1561
01:22:28,169 --> 01:22:30,729
Wait. Where are you going?

1562
01:22:30,772 --> 01:22:34,333
It's over, Dory.
We were too late.

1563
01:22:34,375 --> 01:22:39,142
Nemo's gone,
and I'm going home now.

1564
01:22:39,180 --> 01:22:41,671
No. No, you can't.

1565
01:22:43,518 --> 01:22:45,281
Stop!

1566
01:22:46,888 --> 01:22:48,651
Please don't go away.

1567
01:22:48,690 --> 01:22:50,624
Please?

1568
01:22:50,658 --> 01:22:53,422
No one's ever stuck with me
for so long before.

1569
01:22:53,461 --> 01:22:57,022
And if you leave, I just...

1570
01:22:57,065 --> 01:22:58,999
I remember things
better with you.

1571
01:22:59,033 --> 01:23:02,025
I do. Look... P. Sherman, 42...

1572
01:23:02,070 --> 01:23:05,005
42...

1573
01:23:05,039 --> 01:23:07,803
I remember it.
I do. It's there.

1574
01:23:07,842 --> 01:23:09,935
I know it is because
when I look at you...

1575
01:23:09,977 --> 01:23:11,410
I can feel it.

1576
01:23:11,446 --> 01:23:17,248
I look at you
and I... I'm home.

1577
01:23:19,087 --> 01:23:20,679
Please...

1578
01:23:20,722 --> 01:23:23,350
I don't want that to go away.

1579
01:23:23,391 --> 01:23:25,757
I don't want to forget.

1580
01:23:27,095 --> 01:23:31,156
I'm sorry, Dory, but I do.

1581
01:23:42,443 --> 01:23:45,708
- Manna from heaven.
- Sweet nectar of life!

1582
01:23:45,747 --> 01:23:47,806
Hey! Hey! Hey!

1583
01:23:47,849 --> 01:23:51,250
- This is our spot!
- Get outta here!

1584
01:23:52,587 --> 01:23:54,680
Hey! Hey! Hey!

1585
01:23:54,789 --> 01:23:56,256
Yeah, that's it, fella.

1586
01:23:56,290 --> 01:23:57,917
Just keep on swimmin'.
You got that.

1587
01:23:57,959 --> 01:23:59,984
Too right, mate!

1588
01:24:00,027 --> 01:24:01,324
Oh! I got a live one here!

1589
01:24:01,362 --> 01:24:02,795
Have you seen my dad?

1590
01:24:02,830 --> 01:24:05,060
Gotcha! Hey! Hey!
Come back here!

1591
01:24:05,099 --> 01:24:06,589
You let him go!

1592
01:24:06,634 --> 01:24:08,769
Hey! Hey!

1593
01:24:08,770 --> 01:24:13,264
Dad! Dad!

1594
01:24:13,307 --> 01:24:14,934
Dad!

1595
01:24:28,322 --> 01:24:31,382
Excuse me.

1596
01:24:31,426 --> 01:24:32,654
Are you all right?

1597
01:24:32,693 --> 01:24:35,321
I don't know where I am.
I don't know what's going on.

1598
01:24:35,363 --> 01:24:38,230
I think I lost somebody,
but I can't remember.

1599
01:24:38,266 --> 01:24:42,362
It's OK.
I'm looking for someone, too.

1600
01:24:42,403 --> 01:24:44,837
Hey, we can look together.

1601
01:24:44,872 --> 01:24:47,204
I'm Dory.

1602
01:24:47,241 --> 01:24:48,401
I'm Nemo.

1603
01:24:48,443 --> 01:24:51,810
Nemo? That's a nice name.

1604
01:25:00,755 --> 01:25:03,690
- Dad!
- Dad!

1605
01:25:03,724 --> 01:25:05,783
Wait a minute.
Is it your dad or my dad?

1606
01:25:05,827 --> 01:25:08,295
- My dad.
- Got it. Dad!

1607
01:25:08,329 --> 01:25:10,593
- Where are we, anyway?
- Dad! Dad!

1608
01:25:10,631 --> 01:25:14,533
Oh. Syl... Shi... Sydney.

1609
01:25:14,569 --> 01:25:18,835
P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

1610
01:25:18,873 --> 01:25:20,636
Nemo!

1611
01:25:20,675 --> 01:25:23,041
It's you! You're Nemo!

1612
01:25:23,077 --> 01:25:24,738
Yes, yes, I'm Nemo!

1613
01:25:24,779 --> 01:25:27,373
You're Nemo!
You were dead. I saw you.

1614
01:25:27,415 --> 01:25:29,315
And here you are! I found you.

1615
01:25:29,350 --> 01:25:32,080
You're not dead.
And your father... Your father!

1616
01:25:32,119 --> 01:25:34,485
You know my father?!
Where is he?

1617
01:25:34,522 --> 01:25:37,355
This way!
He went this way. Quick!

1618
01:25:37,391 --> 01:25:39,018
Hey, hey, hey!

1619
01:25:39,060 --> 01:25:40,220
Hey! Hey!

1620
01:25:40,261 --> 01:25:41,751
Have you seen
an orange fish swim by?

1621
01:25:41,796 --> 01:25:44,162
- It looks just like him!
- But bigger!

1622
01:25:44,198 --> 01:25:45,426
Yeah, I saw him, bluey.

1623
01:25:45,466 --> 01:25:46,933
But I'm not tellin' you
where he went...

1624
01:25:46,968 --> 01:25:52,506
and there's no way
you're gonna make me.

1625
01:25:52,507 --> 01:25:53,667
Mine.

1626
01:25:53,774 --> 01:25:56,538
All right! I'll talk!

1627
01:25:56,577 --> 01:26:03,283
He went to the fishing grounds!

1628
01:26:03,284 --> 01:26:05,149
Hey, look out!

1629
01:26:05,186 --> 01:26:07,677
I'm sorry.
I'm just trying to get home.

1630
01:26:08,723 --> 01:26:12,454
Dad! Dad!

1631
01:26:12,493 --> 01:26:13,892
Nemo?

1632
01:26:13,928 --> 01:26:16,396
- Daddy!
- Nemo?

1633
01:26:16,430 --> 01:26:18,399
- Dad!
- Nemo's alive!

1634
01:26:18,466 --> 01:26:20,457
Dory? Nemo!

1635
01:26:20,501 --> 01:26:21,695
Daddy!

1636
01:26:21,736 --> 01:26:24,034
Nemo! I'm coming, Nemo!

1637
01:26:24,071 --> 01:26:27,734
- Dad!
- Nemo! Thank goodness.

1638
01:26:27,775 --> 01:26:30,710
It's all right, son.
It's gonna be OK.

1639
01:26:30,745 --> 01:26:33,614
Turn around!
You're going the wrong way!

1640
01:26:36,117 --> 01:26:37,482
Look out!

1641
01:26:37,518 --> 01:26:40,146
Oh, my...

1642
01:26:56,871 --> 01:27:00,432
Help! He-e-elp!

1643
01:27:00,474 --> 01:27:02,066
- Dory!
- Come on!

1644
01:27:02,109 --> 01:27:03,508
Help! Help!

1645
01:27:03,544 --> 01:27:06,274
Help! Get us out!

1646
01:27:06,314 --> 01:27:08,111
No, no, no! Dory!

1647
01:27:08,149 --> 01:27:11,141
- Dad, I know what to do!
- Nemo! No!

1648
01:27:11,185 --> 01:27:13,915
We have to tell all the fish
to swim down together!

1649
01:27:13,955 --> 01:27:16,651
- Get out of there now!
- I know this will work!

1650
01:27:16,691 --> 01:27:18,625
No, I am not
gonna lose you again!

1651
01:27:18,659 --> 01:27:22,095
There's no time!
It's the only way to save Dory!

1652
01:27:23,397 --> 01:27:24,864
I can do this.

1653
01:27:26,033 --> 01:27:28,160
You're right.

1654
01:27:28,202 --> 01:27:30,033
I know you can.

1655
01:27:30,071 --> 01:27:32,972
- Lucky fin!
- Now, go! Hurry!

1656
01:27:33,007 --> 01:27:35,805
Tell all the fish to swim down!

1657
01:27:35,843 --> 01:27:39,210
Well? You heard my son!
Come on!

1658
01:27:40,715 --> 01:27:43,343
Dory, you have
to tell everybody to...

1659
01:27:43,384 --> 01:27:44,908
Swim down together!

1660
01:27:44,952 --> 01:27:47,216
Do you understand
what I'm saying to you?

1661
01:27:47,254 --> 01:27:49,518
Swim down!

1662
01:27:53,861 --> 01:27:55,089
Everybody swim down!

1663
01:27:55,129 --> 01:27:57,654
Come on, you have to swim down!

1664
01:27:57,698 --> 01:28:00,394
Down! Swim down!

1665
01:28:02,503 --> 01:28:06,132
Swim down! Swim down!

1666
01:28:13,848 --> 01:28:16,248
Don't give up! Keep swimming!

1667
01:28:16,283 --> 01:28:18,717
Just keep swimming!

1668
01:28:22,957 --> 01:28:24,584
That's it!

1669
01:28:27,528 --> 01:28:29,519
It's working!

1670
01:28:31,966 --> 01:28:34,992
Keep swimming! Keep swimming!

1671
01:28:35,036 --> 01:28:37,163
Just keep swimming!
Keep swimming!

1672
01:28:37,204 --> 01:28:38,671
Come on, Dad!

1673
01:28:38,706 --> 01:28:41,197
- You're doing great, son!
- That's my dad.

1674
01:28:41,242 --> 01:28:43,540
Let's get to the bottom!
Keep swimming!

1675
01:28:43,577 --> 01:28:46,102
Just keep swimming,
just keep swimming

1676
01:28:46,147 --> 01:28:48,342
Almost there! Keep swimming!

1677
01:28:51,919 --> 01:28:53,250
Keep swimming!

1678
01:28:55,556 --> 01:28:56,682
Keep swimming!

1679
01:29:07,101 --> 01:29:08,568
- Oof!
- Hey!

1680
01:29:08,602 --> 01:29:12,197
- Dory! Where's Nemo?
- There!

1681
01:29:13,908 --> 01:29:16,968
Oh, no. Nemo!

1682
01:29:22,917 --> 01:29:24,817
Nemo?

1683
01:29:26,487 --> 01:29:28,785
Nemo?

1684
01:29:28,823 --> 01:29:32,816
It's OK. Daddy's here.
Daddy's got you.

1685
01:29:37,264 --> 01:29:38,424
Daddy?

1686
01:29:38,466 --> 01:29:39,990
Oh, thank goodness.

1687
01:29:40,034 --> 01:29:43,731
Dad... I don't hate you.

1688
01:29:43,771 --> 01:29:45,602
Oh, no, no, no.

1689
01:29:45,639 --> 01:29:48,301
I'm so sorry, Nemo.

1690
01:29:57,551 --> 01:30:00,418
- Hey, guess what?
- What?

1691
01:30:00,454 --> 01:30:03,946
Sea turtles... I met one.

1692
01:30:03,991 --> 01:30:08,189
And he was 150 years old.

1693
01:30:08,229 --> 01:30:12,393
- 150?
- Yep.

1694
01:30:12,433 --> 01:30:17,268
Sandy Plankton said
they only live to be 100.

1695
01:30:17,304 --> 01:30:18,862
Sandy Plankton?

1696
01:30:18,906 --> 01:30:20,897
Do you think I would
cross the entire ocean...

1697
01:30:20,941 --> 01:30:23,034
and not know as much
as Sandy Plankton?

1698
01:30:23,077 --> 01:30:25,739
He was 150! Not 100!

1699
01:30:25,780 --> 01:30:29,648
Who is this Sandy Plankton
who knows everything?

1700
01:30:31,352 --> 01:30:34,952
Time for school!
Get up! Let's go!

1701
01:30:34,989 --> 01:30:38,083
- I'm gonna win!
- No, you're not!

1702
01:30:38,125 --> 01:30:41,891
- I did it!
- Aw, my own son beats me!

1703
01:30:41,929 --> 01:30:44,397
Climb aboard, explorers.

1704
01:30:44,431 --> 01:30:47,559
The sea cucumber looks over
to the mollusk and says...

1705
01:30:47,601 --> 01:30:50,468
"With fronds like these,
who needs anemones?"

1706
01:30:52,173 --> 01:30:54,403
Hello, Nemo. Who's this?

1707
01:30:54,508 --> 01:30:57,966
- Exchange student.
- I'm from the E.A.C., dude!

1708
01:30:58,012 --> 01:31:00,640
- Sweet!
- Totally.

1709
01:31:00,681 --> 01:31:02,649
Seriously, Marty.

1710
01:31:02,683 --> 01:31:04,651
Did you really do all
the things you say you did?

1711
01:31:04,685 --> 01:31:06,380
Pardon me.

1712
01:31:06,420 --> 01:31:09,116
Hello.

1713
01:31:09,156 --> 01:31:10,817
Don't be alarmed.

1714
01:31:10,858 --> 01:31:14,624
We wanted to make sure our
newest member got home safely.

1715
01:31:14,662 --> 01:31:16,994
- Thanks, guys.
- See you next week.

1716
01:31:17,031 --> 01:31:20,489
- Keep up with the program.
- Remember, fish are friends...

1717
01:31:20,534 --> 01:31:22,900
Not food! Bye!

1718
01:31:22,937 --> 01:31:24,802
Hold on, here we go!

1719
01:31:24,839 --> 01:31:26,534
Next stop... knowledge!

1720
01:31:26,574 --> 01:31:29,042
Bye, son! Have fun!

1721
01:31:29,076 --> 01:31:30,373
Bye, Dad!

1722
01:31:30,411 --> 01:31:33,847
Oh! Mr. Ray, wait.
I forgot something.

1723
01:31:38,519 --> 01:31:41,147
Love you, Dad.

1724
01:31:41,188 --> 01:31:43,179
I love you, too, son.

1725
01:31:45,459 --> 01:31:48,860
Dad? You can let go now.

1726
01:31:48,896 --> 01:31:52,627
Sorry. Go have an adventure.

1727
01:31:52,666 --> 01:31:54,896
Good-bye! See ya later, dudes!

1728
01:31:55,002 --> 01:31:57,436
- Bye, Elmo!
- Nemo.

1729
01:31:57,471 --> 01:32:00,929
- Bye, Nemo!
- See you after school, Dory!

1730
01:32:00,975 --> 01:32:03,875
Bye, Dad!

1731
01:32:03,878 --> 01:32:05,971
Bye, son.

1732
01:32:22,997 --> 01:32:25,989
Barbara, I don't understand it.

1733
01:32:26,033 --> 01:32:28,399
Here this thing has
a lifetime guarantee...

1734
01:32:28,435 --> 01:32:29,663
and it breaks!

1735
01:32:29,703 --> 01:32:32,001
I had to clean the tank myself,
take all the fish out...

1736
01:32:32,039 --> 01:32:34,405
put 'em in bags, and...

1737
01:32:34,441 --> 01:32:36,932
Where'd the fish go?

1738
01:32:41,782 --> 01:32:43,511
- Come on, Peach!
- Hurry!

1739
01:32:43,550 --> 01:32:45,381
- You can do it!
- That's it.

1740
01:32:45,419 --> 01:32:46,852
Just a little further.

1741
01:32:46,887 --> 01:32:49,117
That's the shortest
red light I've ever seen!

1742
01:32:49,156 --> 01:32:51,386
Come on, Peach!

1743
01:33:00,734 --> 01:33:02,531
Now what?

1744
01:33:10,035 --> 01:33:13,163
Somewhere

1745
01:33:13,205 --> 01:33:15,366
Beyond the sea

1746
01:33:15,407 --> 01:33:20,538
Somewhere, waitin' for me

1747
01:33:20,579 --> 01:33:25,516
My lover stands on golden sands

1748
01:33:25,551 --> 01:33:27,951
And watches the ships

1749
01:33:27,987 --> 01:33:32,014
That go sailin'

1750
01:33:32,057 --> 01:33:34,992
Somewhere

1751
01:33:35,027 --> 01:33:37,359
Beyond the sea

1752
01:33:37,396 --> 01:33:42,493
She's there watchin' for me

1753
01:33:42,534 --> 01:33:47,369
if I could fly
like birds on high

1754
01:33:47,406 --> 01:33:50,102
Then straight to her arms

1755
01:33:50,142 --> 01:33:53,805
I'll go sailin'

1756
01:33:53,846 --> 01:33:56,906
It's far

1757
01:33:56,949 --> 01:33:59,611
Beyond the stars

1758
01:33:59,652 --> 01:34:03,588
It's near, beyond the moon

1759
01:34:04,590 --> 01:34:08,026
I know

1760
01:34:08,060 --> 01:34:10,187
Beyond a doubt

1761
01:34:10,229 --> 01:34:12,197
My heart

1762
01:34:12,231 --> 01:34:15,758
Will lead me there soon

1763
01:34:15,801 --> 01:34:18,770
We'll meet

1764
01:34:18,804 --> 01:34:21,329
Beyond the shore

1765
01:34:21,373 --> 01:34:26,242
We'll kiss just like before

1766
01:34:26,278 --> 01:34:31,113
Happy we'll be beyond the sea

1767
01:34:31,150 --> 01:34:33,482
And never again

1768
01:34:33,519 --> 01:34:37,387
I'll go sailin'

1769
01:35:09,154 --> 01:35:13,682
I know

1770
01:35:13,726 --> 01:35:16,354
Beyond a doubt

1771
01:35:16,395 --> 01:35:18,295
My heart

1772
01:35:18,330 --> 01:35:22,027
Will lead me there soon

1773
01:35:22,067 --> 01:35:24,831
Oh, we'll meet,
I know we'll meet

1774
01:35:24,870 --> 01:35:27,270
Beyond the shore

1775
01:35:27,306 --> 01:35:32,437
We'll kiss just as before

1776
01:35:32,478 --> 01:35:37,438
Happy we will be beyond the sea

1777
01:35:37,483 --> 01:35:39,610
And never again

1778
01:35:39,651 --> 01:35:43,280
I'll go sailin'

1779
01:35:45,324 --> 01:35:47,690
No more sailin'

1780
01:35:49,061 --> 01:35:52,428
So long, sailin', sailin'

1781
01:35:52,464 --> 01:35:54,762
No more sailin'

1782
01:35:56,368 --> 01:36:00,361
Good-bye, farewell, my friend

1783
01:36:00,405 --> 01:36:02,168
No more sailin'

1784
01:36:04,276 --> 01:36:06,039
So long

1785
01:36:06,078 --> 01:36:08,205
Sailin'

1786
01:36:08,247 --> 01:36:09,908
No more sailin'

1787
01:36:13,252 --> 01:36:14,947
No more

1788
01:36:14,987 --> 01:36:16,818
Farewell

1789
01:36:18,791 --> 01:36:20,656
Auf wiedersehen

1790
01:36:20,692 --> 01:36:24,059
Adieu to you and you

1791
01:36:29,735 --> 01:36:31,726
No more sailin'

1792
01:36:33,505 --> 01:36:35,063
No more

1793
01:36:35,107 --> 01:36:39,908
No more sailin'

1794
01:36:41,847 --> 01:36:45,749
No more, no more

1795
01:36:47,886 --> 01:36:54,052
No more sailin'

1796
01:36:58,931 --> 01:37:00,728
No more

1797
01:37:02,601 --> 01:37:04,330
One more time

1798
01:37:05,737 --> 01:37:13,166
No more sailin'
