2
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,280
He was the most extraordinary man
I ever knew.

3
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,480
Did you know him well?

4
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,280
I knew him.

5
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:37,160
Well, nil nisi bonum.

6
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,280
But did he really deserve...

7
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,680
...a place in here?

8
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,760
Lord Allenby, could you give
a few words about Lawrence?

9
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,920
What, more words?

10
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,480
The revolt in the desert...

11
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,160
...played a decisive part
in the Middle Eastern campaign.

12
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:11,040
Yes, sir, but about
Colonel Lawrence himself.

13
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,480
No, no. I didn't know him well,
you know.

14
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:21,440
Mr. Bentley, you know as much
about Lawrence as anybody.

15
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,320
Yes, it was my privilege to know him.

16
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,040
And to make him known to the world.

17
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,520
He was a poet, a scholar
and a mighty warrior.

18
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,760
Thank you.

19
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,440
He was also the most shameless
exhibitionist since Barnum and Bailey.

20
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,520
You, sir. Who are you?

21
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,880
My name is Jackson Bentley.

22
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:46,120
I overheard your last remark
and take the gravest exception.

23
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,480
- He was a great man.
- Did you know him?

24
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,680
No, I can't claim to have known him.

25
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,280
I had the honour to shake his hand
in Damascus.

26
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,040
Knew him? I never knew him.

27
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,600
He had some minor function
on my staff in Cairo.

28
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,040
Michael George Hartley...

29
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,480
...this is a nasty, dark little room.

30
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,680
That's right.

31
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,080
We are not happy in it.

32
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,960
I am. It's better than
a nasty, dark little trench.

33
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,480
- Then you're a big noble fellow.
- That's right.

34
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,440
Here is William Potter
with my newspaper.

35
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,080
- Here you are, tosh.
- Thanks.

36
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,080
Would you care for one of
Corporal Hartley's cigarettes?

37
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,720
- Is it there?
- Of course.

38
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,480
Headlines.

39
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:55,040
But I bet it isn't mentioned
in the Times.

40
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,880
"Bedouin tribes attack
Turkish stronghold."

41
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:04,320
I bet that no one in this
headquarters even knows it happened.

42
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:08,080
Or would care if it did.
Allow me to ignite your cigarette.

43
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,480
- Mr. Lawrence?
- Yes.

44
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,880
- Flimsy, sir.
- Thank you.

45
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,800
You'll do that once too often.
It's only flesh and blood.

46
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,680
Michael George Hartley,
you're a philosopher.

47
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,680
And you're balmy!

48
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:46,080
- It damn well hurts!
- Certainly, it hurts.

49
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,040
What's the trick, then?

50
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:52,160
The trick, William Potter,
is not minding that it hurts.

51
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,240
By the way, if Captain Gibbon
should enquire for me...

52
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,680
...tell him I've gone
for a chat with the general.

53
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,440
- He's balmy.
- He's all right.

54
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,600
Lawrence.

55
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,520
Yes?

56
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,480
You're supposed to be...

57
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,160
Do you usually wear your cap
in the mess?

58
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,960
Always.

59
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,320
You should be on duty.
Where are you going?

60
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,880
Mustn't talk shop,
Freddie, not in the mess.

61
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,920
I'm going for a powwow
with the general.

62
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,480
I'm not asking as your superior,
but as the secretary of this mess.

63
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,080
We don't want chaps in here
who should be on duty.

64
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,680
Where are you going?

65
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,280
I must say, Lawrence!

66
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:40,200
- Sorry.
- You're a clown, Lawrence.

67
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,680
Ah, well, we can't all be lion tamers.

68
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,200
Sorry.

69
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,880
It's an intrigue, Dryden.

70
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,200
I do not propose to let
an overweening, crass lieutenant...

71
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,800
...thumb his nose at his commander
and get away with it.

72
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:00,160
It doesn't sound as though
he'd be any great loss, sir.

73
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:03,640
Don't try that, Dryden.
There's a principle involved.

74
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,280
There is, indeed.

75
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,400
He's of no use here in Cairo.

76
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,560
He might be in Arabia.
He knows his stuff, sir.

77
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,280
Knows the books, you mean.

78
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,480
I've already sent out
Colonel Brighton, who's a soldier.

79
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,360
If Brighton thinks we should send
some arms, we will.

80
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,080
Well, what more do you want?

81
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:25,280
That there would be no question
of Lieutenant Lawrence...

82
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,320
...giving military advice.

83
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,400
By God, I should hope not.

84
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:33,960
It's just that the Arab Bureau would
like its own man on the spot to...

85
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,200
To what?

86
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,800
To make our own appraisal
of the situation.

87
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:41,920
I'll tell you, it's my considered
opinion and that of my staff...

88
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,800
...that time spent on the Bedouin
will be time wasted.

89
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,320
They're a nation of sheep-stealers.

90
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,320
They did attack Medina.

91
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,800
And the Turks made mincemeat
of them.

92
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,280
We don't know that.

93
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:58,840
We know that they didn't take it.
A storm in a teacup, a sideshow.

94
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:03,320
In my opinion, this whole theatre
of operations is a sideshow.

95
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,760
The real war's being fought against
Germans, not Turks.

96
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,720
Not here, but on
the Western front in the trenches.

97
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,280
Your Bedouin Army,
or whatever it calls itself...

98
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,000
...would be a sideshow of a sideshow.

99
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,760
Big things have small beginnings, sir.

100
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:22,000
Does the Arab Bureau
want a big thing in Arabia?

101
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,520
Does the bureau think they'll sit down
under us when this war is over?

102
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:31,480
The bureau thinks the job of
the moment, sir, is to win the war.

103
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,240
Don't tell me my duty, Mr. Dryden.

104
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,080
- Lawrence, sir.
- Send him in.

105
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,040
Good morning, sir.

106
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,680
Salute.

107
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:47,000
If you're insubordinate,
I shall put you under arrest.

108
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,920
- It's my manner.
- Your what?

109
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,880
My manner. It looks insubordinate,
but it isn't.

110
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,960
I can't make out whether you're
bad-mannered or just half-witted.

111
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:59,080
- I have the same problem, sir.
- Shut up.

112
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,560
The Arab Bureau thinks you
would be of use to them in Arabia.

113
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,360
Why, I can't imagine.

114
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,920
You can't perform
your present duties properly.

115
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:11,880
"I cannot fiddle, but I can make
a great state from a little city."

116
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,200
- What?
- Themistocles, sir.

117
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,880
- A Greek philosopher.
- I know you've been well-educated.

118
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,280
It says so in your dossier.

119
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,440
You're the kind of creature
I can't stand, Lawrence.

120
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,680
But I suppose I could be wrong.

121
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,920
All right, Dryden.
You can have him for six weeks.

122
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,480
Who knows? It might even
make a man of him. Come in!

123
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,680
Yes, what is it?

124
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,520
The convoy will be in
Port Said tomorrow night.

125
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,640
- Is that certain?
- Yes, sir.

126
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,800
There doesn't seem to be
any artillery.

127
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,680
But there must be artillery!

128
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,680
Sir, this is something
of an expedition.

129
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:00,960
He has to get to Yenbo, find a guide,
find the Arabs and then get back.

130
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,680
He can't do that in six weeks.

131
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,880
- Two months, then.
- Three.

132
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:11,240
All right, three. Now, will you
let me do some work, Mr. Dryden?

133
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,080
Thank you, sir.

134
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:18,680
I'd like to say, sir,
that I am grateful for this.

135
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,680
Shut up and get out.

136
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,880
Sir?

137
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:36,400
How can I fight a bloody war
without bloody artillery?

138
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,120
- How did you do it?
- Might better ask why I bothered to.

139
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,680
- Because I'm the man for the job.
- I just wonder about that.

140
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,720
Of course I am.
What is the job, by the way?

141
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,600
Find Prince Feisal.

142
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,560
Good. And when I've found him?

143
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,680
Find out what kind of a man he is.

144
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:59,480
Find out what his intentions are.
Not his immediate intentions.

145
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,080
That is Colonel Brighton's business,
not yours.

146
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:06,440
I mean, his intentions
in Arabia altogether.

147
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,040
That's new.

148
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,880
Where are they now?

149
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,840
Anywhere within 300 miles of Medina.

150
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,520
They're Hashemite Bedouins.

151
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:22,240
They can cross 60 miles of desert
in a day.

152
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,400
Thanks. This is going to be fun.

153
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:28,640
Lawrence, only two kinds of creature
get fun in the desert:

154
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:32,280
Bedouins and gods,
and you're neither. Take it from me.

155
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:35,680
For ordinary men,
it's a burning fiery furnace.

156
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,480
No, Dryden. It's going to be fun.

157
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,280
It is recognized that you have
a funny sense of fun.

158
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,880
Here you may drink.

159
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,680
One cup.

160
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,680
You do not drink?

161
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,280
No.

162
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,240
I'll drink when you do.

163
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,160
I am Bedu.

164
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:20,680
Truly, now, you are a British officer?

165
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,280
Yes.

166
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,480
From Cairo?

167
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,280
Yes.

168
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,880
- You did not ride from Cairo?
- No.

169
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,880
Thank heaven. It's 900 miles.
I came by boat.

170
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,840
And before?

171
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,880
From Britain?

172
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,480
Yes.

173
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,080
Truly?

174
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,920
From Oxfordshire.

175
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,280
Is that a desert country?

176
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:53,400
No. A fat country. Fat people.

177
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,080
You are not fat?

178
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,880
No.

179
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,880
I'm different.

180
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,080
Here...

181
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,240
...take it.

182
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,400
First I take you to Lord Feisal,
then you give it to me.

183
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,080
Take it now.

184
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,480
Bedu food.

185
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,480
Good.

186
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,880
More?

187
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,880
- Bedu.
- Where?

188
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,440
From here to Lord Feisal's camp
is Harith country.

189
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,880
Yes, I know.

190
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,920
- I am not Harith.
- No.

191
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,680
Hazimi, of the Beni Salem.

192
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:09,720
Put the right foot in tight.
Lock it with your left foot.

193
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,480
When you are ready to go...

194
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:14,680
...hit her on the shoulder
and say, "Hut-hut-hut."

195
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,080
Today will be difficult,
but tomorrow, good riding.

196
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,840
I think we reach Masturah Well
tomorrow. Yes.

197
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:58,520
And from Masturah Well to
Lord Feisal's camp, one day more.

198
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:59,840
Now!

199
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,680
Good?

200
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,640
It's all right.

201
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,840
This is a Harith well.

202
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,680
The Harith are a dirty people.

203
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,280
Turks?

204
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,760
Bedu.

205
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,040
Who is he?

206
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,080
He is dead.

207
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,880
Yes.

208
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,160
Why?

209
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,280
This is my well.

210
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,360
I have drunk from it.

211
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,000
You are welcome.

212
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,920
He was my friend.

213
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,880
- That?
- Yes, that.

214
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,640
- This pistol yours?
- No, his.

215
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,880
His?

216
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,680
Mine.

217
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,080
Then I will use it.

218
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,800
Your friend...

219
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,840
...was a Hazimi of the Beni Salem.

220
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,480
I know.

221
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,920
I am Ali ibn el Kharish.

222
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,440
I have heard of you.

223
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,640
So...

224
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,680
...what was a Hazimi doing here?

225
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,280
He was taking me to help
Prince Feisal.

226
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:08,080
- You've been sent from Cairo.
- Yes.

227
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:11,880
I have been in Cairo for my schooling.

228
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:15,080
I can both read and write.

229
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:22,480
My Lord Feisal already
has an Englishman.

230
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,480
What is your name?

231
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,840
My name is for my friends.

232
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:35,080
None of my friends is a murderer.

233
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,880
You are angry, English.

234
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,080
He was nothing.

235
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,040
The well is everything.

236
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:54,880
The Hazimi may not drink
at our wells.

237
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,640
He knew that.

238
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,040
Salaam.

239
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,160
Sherif Ali.

240
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,440
So long as the Arabs fight
tribe against tribe...

241
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,120
...so long will they be
a little people...

242
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,680
...a silly people.

243
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:15,200
Greedy, barbarous and cruel,
as you are.

244
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,760
Come.

245
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,280
I will take you to Feisal.

246
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,480
I do not want your company, sherif.

247
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,880
Wadi Safra is another day from here.

248
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,120
You will not find it,
and you will die.

249
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:45,080
I will find it with this.

250
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:55,240
Good army compass.

251
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,640
How if I take it?

252
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,320
Then you would be a thief.

253
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,760
Have you no fear, English?

254
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:05,080
My fear is my concern.

255
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,880
Truly.

256
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,640
God be with you, English.

257
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:01,960
As I walk along the Bois de Boulogne
With an independent air

258
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,040
You can hear the girls declare

259
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:07,000
He must be a millionaire

260
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:30,440
I'm the man who broke the bank
At Monte Carlo

261
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,600
Hey, you!

262
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:10,240
- I've been waiting for you.
- Did you know I was coming?

263
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,640
I knew someone was coming.
Feisal told me.

264
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,200
How did he know?

265
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:17,200
Not much happens within 50 miles
of Feisal that he doesn't know.

266
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,360
I'll give him that. No escort?

267
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,000
My guide was killed
at the Masturah Well.

268
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:25,000
- Turks?
- No, an Arab.

269
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,560
Bloody savages.

270
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:32,200
- This is Wadi Safra, isn't it?
- Yes, they're over there.

271
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,880
Just a minute.
What's your name and who sent you?

272
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:39,000
Lawrence. I've been seconded
to the Arab Bureau.

273
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,800
What are you to do
for the Arab Bureau?

274
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,800
Well, it's rather vague, sir.
I'm to appreciate the situation.

275
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:53,200
Well, that won't be difficult.
The situation's bloody awful.

276
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,440
Their morale, if they ever had any,
which I doubt...

277
00:31:56,680 --> 00:32:00,480
...the Turks knocked out of them
in front of Medina, with howitzers.

278
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:03,040
They're fading away by dozens
every night.

279
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,800
What I want to say is this:

280
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:07,600
Wherever you are
and whoever you are with...

281
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,600
...you're a British officer.
Here's an order.

282
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:13,400
When we get into that camp,
you're to keep your mouth shut.

283
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:17,400
- Do you understand what I'm saying?
- I understand what you're saying.

284
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,360
You'll make your appreciation
and get back to...

285
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,600
Oh, my God.

286
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,000
Not again.

287
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:57,720
I've told him!
God knows I've told him.

288
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,960
"Move South," I've said.
"You're still in range."

289
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:06,200
They simply will not understand
what modern weapons do!

290
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:34,920
Stand and fight. Stand and fight.

291
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,200
Fire back at them.

292
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:53,280
- Who are you?
- Lieutenant Lawrence, sir.

293
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,120
Seconded to the Arab Bureau.

294
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:58,480
This is a bloody mess, sir.
We'll have to move south.

295
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:01,000
Yes, colonel, 50 miles south.

296
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:04,000
You were right and I was wrong.

297
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,240
We must take some thought
for the wounded.

298
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:09,600
- We can take care of them at Yenbo.
- Lf they can get to Yenbo.

299
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,240
They can hardly come with us.

300
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:15,640
No. They must try to reach Yenbo.
Lieutenant?

301
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,600
Lawrence.

302
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:20,200
You understand,
Lieutenant Lawrence...

303
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:25,280
...my people are unused to
explosives and machines.

304
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:29,560
First the guns, and now this.

305
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,200
Cigarette?

306
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,800
I'm sorry.

307
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,920
Cigarette, Your Excellency?

308
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,040
Umph off.

309
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:42,600
Please, Your Excellency.
Just one for two?

310
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:00,640
Hold it, Jenkins!

311
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,200
Jenkins!

312
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,800
Lawrence?

313
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,360
You have no servant.

314
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,000
- I don't need a servant.
- No?

315
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:26,840
We can do everything. Light fires,
cook food, wash clothes.

316
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,960
- Yes, everything.
- I don't doubt it.

317
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:32,160
- It will be very nice for you.
- I can't afford it.

318
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:54,440
Recite, then, as much of the Koran
as may be easy to you.

319
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:58,560
Recite, then, as much of the Koran
as may be easy to you.

320
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:02,360
God knoweth that there be
some among you sick...

321
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:08,360
...while others travel through the
Earth in quest for the bounties of God.

322
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:13,720
Others do battle in His cause.

323
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:18,080
Recite, therefore,
as much as may be easy.

324
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:21,400
And observe the prayers.

325
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:27,760
This will be best and richest
in the recompense.

326
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:32,600
Seek ye the forgiveness of God.

327
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:38,200
Verily, God is forgiving, merciful...

328
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,800
Greetings, Ali.

329
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,720
- My lord.
- Sherif Ali.

330
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:46,000
Lieutenant Lawrence, you have met
Sherif Ali, I think.

331
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,600
Yes, my lord.

332
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,200
And now, Selim, "The Brightness."

333
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,640
"By the noonday brightness...

334
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,920
...and by the night
when it darkeneth...

335
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:00,480
...thy Lord hath not forsaken thee...

336
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:03,040
...neither hath He been displeased.

337
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:07,360
And surely the future shall be better
for thee than the past."

338
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:11,000
"And in the end shall your Lord be
bounteous to thee...

339
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,400
...and thou be satisfied."

340
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,600
So?

341
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,640
Yes, colonel.

342
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:23,560
- I want a decision, sir.
- You want me to fall back on Yenbo.

343
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:26,400
Well, you're not doing
much good here, sir.

344
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:30,360
I'm sorry to rub it in, sir,
but we can't supply you here.

345
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,480
You could supply us through Aqaba!

346
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,400
Aqaba!

347
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:37,720
If you can get ahold of Aqaba,
we can supply you.

348
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,840
- But you can't!
- You could.

349
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,760
You mean, the navy?

350
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:46,840
The Turks have 12-inch guns
at Aqaba, sir.

351
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,960
Can you imagine what that means?

352
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,880
Yes, I can imagine.

353
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:55,120
Put that out of your mind, sir.
The navy's got other things to do.

354
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,760
Oh, yes. Protecting the Suez Canal.

355
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,960
The one essential sector of this front
is and must be the canal.

356
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,960
You can see that, sir, surely.

357
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:07,000
I see that the canal is
an essential British interest.

358
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,120
It is of little consequence to us.

359
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,560
I must ask you not to speak like that.

360
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:14,360
British and Arab interests are
one and the same.

361
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,280
Possibly.

362
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:21,040
Upon my word, sir, you're ungrateful.

363
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,800
Fall back on Yenbo and we will
give you equipment.

364
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,080
Give you arms, advice,
training, everything.

365
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:29,120
- Guns?
- A modern rifle for every man.

366
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:32,120
No. Guns. Artillery.

367
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:35,480
Guns like the Turkish guns at Medina.

368
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:38,600
Yes, give us guns
and keep the training.

369
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:42,400
Your men need training
far more than guns, sir.

370
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,200
English will teach
Bedu to fight?

371
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:48,400
We will teach them, Sherif Ali,
to fight a modern mechanized army.

372
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:53,920
Yes, lieutenant?
What do you think about Yenbo?

373
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:00,320
I think it is far from Damascus.

374
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:03,840
We'll have you in Damascus, sir.
Never fear.

375
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:06,920
Have you been in Damascus,
Mr. Lawrence?

376
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:08,840
Yes, my lord.

377
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,360
It is beautiful, is it not?

378
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,280
- Very.
- That will do, Lawrence.

379
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:17,440
Dreaming won't get you to Damascus,
but discipline will.

380
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:22,520
Look, Great Britain is a small
country, much smaller than yours.

381
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,960
Small population compared with some.

382
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:28,160
It's small, but it's great. And why?

383
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:31,160
- Because it has guns.
- Because it has discipline.

384
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,600
Because it has a navy,
because of this...

385
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,360
...the English go
where they please...

386
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:38,080
...and strike where they please.
This makes them great.

387
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,360
- Right.
- Mr. Lawrence, that will do!

388
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,760
Lawrence is not your military adviser.

389
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:45,040
But I would like to hear his opinion.

390
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,560
Damn it!
Who do you take your orders from?

391
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:51,080
From Lord Feisal, in Feisal's tent.

392
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:56,360
Old fool! Why turn from him to him?
They are master and man.

393
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:00,960
My lord, I think...

394
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:04,000
I think your book is right.

395
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:08,520
The desert is an ocean
in which no oar is dipped.

396
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,680
On this ocean, the Bedu go
where they please...

397
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,320
...and strike where they please.

398
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,720
This is the way the Bedu has
always fought.

399
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:17,760
You're famed through the world
for fighting this way.

400
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:20,000
And this is the way you should
fight now.

401
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,760
I don't know.

402
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,160
I'm sorry, sir, but you're wrong.

403
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:28,920
Fall back on Yenbo, the Arab Rising
becomes one unit in the British army.

404
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:31,200
- What is this to you?
- You're a traitor.

405
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:33,440
No, colonel.

406
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:36,800
He is a young man,
and young men are passionate.

407
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,000
They must say their say.

408
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:45,880
But wiser people must decide.
I know you are right.

409
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:48,480
Very well. When shall we move?
The sooner the better.

410
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:51,200
You'll lose another 50 men tonight.

411
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:55,000
You tread heavily...

412
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,560
...but you speak the truth.

413
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:03,480
I will give you my answer tomorrow.
And now...

414
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:05,600
...it is late.

415
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:23,040
Colonel Brighton means
to put my men...

416
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:25,960
...under European officers,
does he not?

417
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,000
In effect, my lord, yes.

418
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:30,200
And I must do it...

419
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:34,400
...because the Turks have
European guns.

420
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:37,160
But I fear to do it...

421
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:40,160
...upon my soul I do.

422
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:46,040
The English have a great hunger for
desolate places.

423
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:49,280
I fear they hunger for Arabia.

424
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,400
Then you must deny it to them.

425
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:55,040
You are an Englishman.
Are you not loyal to England?

426
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:58,480
To England and to other things.

427
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:01,240
To England and Arabia both?

428
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:03,200
And is that possible?

429
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:13,720
I think you are another of these
desert-Ioving English.

430
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:16,000
Doughty, Stanhope...

431
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:18,760
...Gordon of Khartoum.

432
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,160
No Arab loves the desert.

433
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:26,200
We love water and green trees.
There is nothing in the desert.

434
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:29,600
And no man needs nothing.

435
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:36,000
Or is it that you think we are
something you can play with...

436
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:39,680
...because we are a little people,
a silly people...

437
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:44,000
...greedy, barbarous and cruel?

438
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:47,440
Or do you know, lieutenant,
in the Arab city of Cordoba...

439
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:50,040
...were two miles of lighting
in the streets...

440
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:51,880
...when London was a village.

441
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:54,840
Yes, you were great.

442
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:57,120
Nine centuries ago.

443
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:59,440
Time to be great again, my lord.

444
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:02,800
Which is why my father made this war
upon the Turks.

445
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:06,640
My father, Mr. Lawrence,
not the English.

446
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:10,000
But my father is old...

447
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,600
...and I...

448
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:17,760
...I long for the vanished
gardens of Cordoba.

449
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:22,400
However, before the gardens
must come the fighting.

450
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:27,400
To be great again, it seems that we
need the English...

451
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:28,640
...or...

452
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:30,200
Or?

453
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:34,200
What no man can provide,
Mr. Lawrence.

454
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:36,800
We need a miracle.

455
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:35,480
Aqaba.

456
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:40,160
Aqaba.

457
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,560
From the land.

458
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:45,160
You are mad.

459
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:49,800
To come to Aqaba by land we should
have to cross the Nefud Desert.

460
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:51,200
That's right.

461
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:53,600
The Nefud cannot be crossed.

462
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:55,600
I'll cross it if you will.

463
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:59,800
You? It takes more than a compass,
Englishman.

464
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:02,720
The Nefud is the worst place
God created.

465
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:06,760
I can't answer for the place.
Only for myself.

466
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:08,600
Fifty men?

467
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:11,320
Fifty? Against Aqaba?

468
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:13,840
If 50 men came out of the Nefud...

469
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:16,960
...they would be 50 men
other men might join.

470
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:20,000
The Howeitat are there, I hear.

471
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:23,200
The Howeitat are brigands.
They'll sell themselves to anyone.

472
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:25,600
- Good fighters, though.
- Good...

473
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:29,760
Yes. There are guns at Aqaba.

474
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:34,000
They face the sea, Sherif Ali,
and cannot be turned around.

475
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:37,760
From the landward side,
there are no guns at Aqaba.

476
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:42,840
With good reason. It cannot be
approached from the landward side.

477
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:45,600
Certainly the Turks don't dream of it.

478
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:50,800
Aqaba's over there.

479
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:55,360
It's only a matter of going.

480
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:58,720
You are mad.

481
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:08,000
And where are you going, lieutenant?

482
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:11,200
With 50 of my men.

483
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:13,920
To work your miracle.

484
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:18,400
Blasphemy is a bad beginning
for such a journey.

485
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:21,560
- Who told you?
- Ali did.

486
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:23,360
Why not you?

487
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:27,800
You are falling back from Yenbo, sir?

488
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:30,240
Yes, I must.

489
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:33,400
But I will spare these to you.

490
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:38,200
Did Ali break confidence to tell me?

491
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:42,600
Sherif Ali owes you his allegiance,
my lord.

492
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:45,880
Yet you did not tell
Colonel Brighton.

493
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:47,080
No.

494
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:00,400
Since you do know...

495
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:04,280
...we can claim to arrive
in the name of Feisal of Mecca.

496
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:07,800
Yes, Lieutenant Lawrence,
you may claim it.

497
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:11,560
But in whose name do you ride?

498
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:36,640
Sherif, I caught them.
They have tracked us.

499
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,000
They were here. I caught them.

500
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:41,960
Why are you here? Boy!

501
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:44,040
To serve Lord Lawrence, sherif.

502
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:46,760
This is true, Lawrence.
They do wish it.

503
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,800
You have been tracking us.

504
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:51,560
- You were told to stay.
- No, sherif.

505
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:53,760
Our camel strayed. We followed her.

506
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:56,840
She led us here to be
Lord Lawrence's servants.

507
00:53:57,080 --> 00:53:59,560
- It is the will of Allah.
- Blasphemy.

508
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:01,000
Don't do that.

509
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:05,960
No, Lawrence, these are not servants.
These are outcasts, parent-less.

510
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:09,160
Be warned. They are not suitable.

511
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:13,000
They sound very suitable.
You can ride with the baggage.

512
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:17,880
These are not servants.
These are worshippers.

513
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:24,440
One shilling, every week?

514
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:26,200
That is fair.

515
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:28,120
- Each?
- No.

516
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:29,880
- That is too much.
- All right.

517
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:42,160
They will be lucky for you.
Allah favours the compassionate.

518
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:56,720
There is the railway.

519
00:54:57,560 --> 00:55:00,360
And that is the desert.

520
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:05,320
From here until the other side,
no water but what we carry.

521
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:08,680
For the camels, no water at all.

522
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:11,360
If the camels die...

523
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:13,960
...we die.

524
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:17,520
And in 20 days they will start to die.

525
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:25,960
There's no time to waste, then,
is there?

526
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:53,600
I was thinking.

527
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:55,440
You were drifting.

528
00:57:57,360 --> 00:58:00,840
Yes. It will not happen again.

529
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:04,680
Be warned, you were drifting.

530
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:07,240
It will not happen again.

531
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:08,680
That water is wasted.

532
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:16,080
From now on,
we must travel by night...

533
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:19,120
...and rest while it is
too hot to travel.

534
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:21,680
A few hours each day.

535
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:25,320
Why don't we start now?

536
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:28,040
No. We will rest now.

537
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:30,800
Three hours.

538
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,320
Fine.

539
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:34,280
I'll wake you.

540
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:48,720
Do we rest here?

541
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:52,000
There is no rest now short of water.

542
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:54,200
The other side of that.

543
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:57,400
And how much of that is there?

544
01:01:57,680 --> 01:01:59,200
I'm not sure.

545
01:02:00,280 --> 01:02:04,400
But however much, it must be crossed
before tomorrow's sun gets up.

546
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:07,600
This is the sun's anvil.

547
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:37,600
Have we done it?

548
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:40,840
No, but we're off the anvil.

549
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:43,160
Thank God for that anyway.

550
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:45,200
Yes, thank Him.

551
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:48,880
Lawrence, I do not think you know
how you have tempted Him.

552
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:50,360
I know.

553
01:03:53,560 --> 01:03:55,000
We've done it.

554
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:56,760
God willing.

555
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:00,760
When do we reach the wells?

556
01:04:01,120 --> 01:04:04,160
God willing, midday.

557
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:07,880
- Then we've done it.
- Thank Him, Lawrence. Thank Him.

558
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:12,960
Gasim's.

559
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:18,360
What's happened to him?

560
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:20,560
God knows.

561
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:23,960
Why don't you stop?

562
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:27,760
For what? He will be dead by midday.

563
01:04:32,840 --> 01:04:34,560
We must go back.

564
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:37,560
What for, to die with Gasim?

565
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:40,960
In one hour comes the sun.

566
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:46,840
In God's name, understand!
We cannot go back!

567
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:48,360
I can.

568
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:50,760
Take the boys.

569
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:58,760
If you go back, you kill yourself,
is all.

570
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:01,160
Gasim you have killed already.

571
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:02,920
Get out of my way.

572
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:06,960
Gasim's time is come, Lawrence.
It is written.

573
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:08,440
Nothing is written!

574
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:12,760
Go back, then!

575
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:16,360
What did you bring us here for
with your blasphemous conceit?

576
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:19,160
English blasphemer!

577
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:21,720
Aqaba?

578
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:23,920
Was it Aqaba?

579
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:27,360
You will not be at Aqaba, English!

580
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:30,840
Go back, blasphemer...

581
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:33,320
...but you will not be at Aqaba.

582
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:35,320
I shall be at Aqaba.

583
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:37,520
That is written.

584
01:05:38,120 --> 01:05:39,360
In here.

585
01:05:48,840 --> 01:05:50,520
English!

586
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:52,360
English!

587
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:12,040
Lawrence! Daud!

588
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:17,200
Nothing is written.

589
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:49,560
Al Lawrence.

590
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:55,200
Farraj.

591
01:14:56,280 --> 01:14:57,400
Wash.

592
01:15:33,080 --> 01:15:34,680
Al Lawrence.

593
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:39,560
Truly, for some men nothing is written
unless they write it.

594
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:46,920
Not Al Lawrence. Just Lawrence.

595
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:49,760
- AI Lawrence is better.
- True.

596
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:54,160
Your father too, just Mr. Lawrence?

597
01:16:00,240 --> 01:16:02,920
My father is Sir Thomas Chapman.

598
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:05,800
- Is that a lord?
- A kind of lord.

599
01:16:06,120 --> 01:16:08,760
Then when he dies,
you too will be a lord.

600
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:10,160
No.

601
01:16:12,240 --> 01:16:13,960
You have an elder brother.

602
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:20,360
But then, I do not understand this.
Your father's name is Chapman.

603
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:23,720
He didn't marry my mother.

604
01:16:25,160 --> 01:16:26,760
I see.

605
01:16:27,240 --> 01:16:28,560
I'm sorry.

606
01:16:30,440 --> 01:16:34,200
It seems to me that you are free to
choose your own name, then.

607
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:39,080
Yes, I suppose I am.

608
01:16:40,360 --> 01:16:42,000
Al Lawrence is best.

609
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:48,760
All right, I'll settle for
Al Lawrence.

610
01:17:17,240 --> 01:17:20,160
They are the robes of a sherif
of the Beni Wejh.

611
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:33,960
Very fine.

612
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:39,760
- Great honour.
- The honour is to us. Salaam, sherif.

613
01:17:40,040 --> 01:17:42,320
- Is it permitted?
- Surely.

614
01:17:47,320 --> 01:17:52,160
He for whom nothing is written may
write himself a clan.

615
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:02,960
They are good for riding. Try.

616
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:52,080
What are you doing, Englishman?

617
01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:54,920
As you see.

618
01:19:56,160 --> 01:19:57,120
Are you alone?

619
01:19:57,600 --> 01:19:59,080
Almost.

620
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:09,760
Are you with those dogs
drinking at my well?

621
01:20:09,960 --> 01:20:11,320
Yours?

622
01:20:14,760 --> 01:20:16,520
I am Auda Abu Tayi.

623
01:20:18,200 --> 01:20:20,920
I've heard of another man
of that name.

624
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:23,400
Other? What other?

625
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:27,800
The Auda I'd heard of wouldn't need to
summon help to look after his wells.

626
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:33,240
He must be a great hero.

627
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:35,080
He is.

628
01:20:35,320 --> 01:20:38,360
He wouldn't refuse water to men
coming out of Nefud Desert.

629
01:20:38,720 --> 01:20:40,680
Now, would he not?

630
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:45,920
No, that must be some other man.

631
01:20:48,280 --> 01:20:50,120
Here is my help.

632
01:21:14,920 --> 01:21:17,440
Son, what fashion is this?

633
01:21:18,760 --> 01:21:22,280
- Harith, Father.
- What manner of Harith?

634
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:24,200
A Beni Wejh sherif.

635
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:26,560
And is he Harith?

636
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:28,920
No, Father, English.

637
01:21:32,040 --> 01:21:33,320
Son...

638
01:21:34,120 --> 01:21:36,120
...they are stealing our water.

639
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:38,760
Tell them we are coming.

640
01:21:39,480 --> 01:21:40,520
Tell them.

641
01:22:47,560 --> 01:22:49,160
- Empty that!
- Do not!

642
01:22:51,320 --> 01:22:53,440
It is Auda of the Howeitat who speaks.

643
01:22:54,200 --> 01:22:56,120
It is Ali of the Harith who answers.

644
01:23:11,680 --> 01:23:12,920
Harith.

645
01:23:13,760 --> 01:23:14,880
Ali.

646
01:23:15,560 --> 01:23:17,720
Does your father still steal?

647
01:23:19,720 --> 01:23:20,880
No.

648
01:23:22,440 --> 01:23:25,280
Does Auda take me for
one of his own bastards?

649
01:23:26,440 --> 01:23:29,480
No. There is no resemblance.

650
01:23:30,320 --> 01:23:32,640
Alas, you resemble your father.

651
01:23:33,080 --> 01:23:35,840
- Auda flatters me.
- You are easily flattered.

652
01:23:36,360 --> 01:23:38,720
I knew your father well.

653
01:23:39,200 --> 01:23:40,920
Did you know your own?

654
01:23:44,160 --> 01:23:48,720
We are 50, you are two.
How if we shot you down?

655
01:23:49,200 --> 01:23:52,120
Why, then you have a blood feud
with the Howeitat.

656
01:23:53,400 --> 01:23:56,280
- Do you desire it?
- Not the generals in Cairo...

657
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:59,760
...nor the sultan himself desire that.

658
01:24:02,760 --> 01:24:03,880
Call off your men.

659
01:24:09,240 --> 01:24:11,760
This honours the unworthy.

660
01:24:12,040 --> 01:24:14,080
I've only just begun to teach him.

661
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:18,400
And what are you teaching him today?
Howeitat hospitality?

662
01:24:18,640 --> 01:24:20,560
Be not clever with me, English.

663
01:24:22,200 --> 01:24:25,360
- Who is he?
- A friend of Prince Feisal's.

664
01:24:34,520 --> 01:24:37,520
- So you desire my hospitality?
- Yes.

665
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:39,200
Is he your tongue?

666
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:41,600
We do desire it.

667
01:24:44,640 --> 01:24:47,600
Then it is given, if you will take it.

668
01:24:49,080 --> 01:24:50,840
I'm at my summer camp, a poor place.

669
01:24:51,080 --> 01:24:55,640
Well, to me it seems a poor place.
Some men find it marvellous.

670
01:24:56,360 --> 01:25:00,600
Tomorrow, maybe I will allow the
Turks to buy you, friends of Feisal.

671
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:03,000
But...

672
01:25:03,480 --> 01:25:04,760
...dine with me.

673
01:25:06,080 --> 01:25:07,480
Dine with Auda, English.

674
01:25:08,280 --> 01:25:10,640
Dine with the Howeitat, Harith.

675
01:25:11,400 --> 01:25:15,960
It is my pleasure that you dine
with me in Wadi Rumm!

676
01:27:49,080 --> 01:27:52,600
This thing you work against Aqaba...

677
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:55,280
...what profit do you hope from it?

678
01:27:55,480 --> 01:27:57,960
We work it for Feisal of Mecca.

679
01:27:58,200 --> 01:28:00,200
The Harith do not work for profit.

680
01:28:01,320 --> 01:28:04,920
Well, if it is in a man to be
a servant, Sherif Ali...

681
01:28:05,400 --> 01:28:07,800
...he could find worse masters
than Feisal.

682
01:28:08,120 --> 01:28:10,840
But I...
I cannot serve.

683
01:28:11,680 --> 01:28:14,600
You permit the Turks to stay in Aqaba.

684
01:28:14,840 --> 01:28:16,760
Yes, it is my pleasure.

685
01:28:21,560 --> 01:28:24,880
We do not work this thing for Feisal.

686
01:28:25,400 --> 01:28:26,360
No?

687
01:28:27,360 --> 01:28:29,920
- For the English, then?
- For the Arabs.

688
01:28:30,520 --> 01:28:31,880
The Arabs?

689
01:28:32,640 --> 01:28:36,760
The Howeitat, Ageyil, Ruala,
Beni Sahkr, these I know.

690
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:38,880
I have even heard of the Harith.

691
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:40,960
But the Arabs?

692
01:28:41,400 --> 01:28:43,480
What tribe is that?

693
01:28:45,080 --> 01:28:49,080
They're a tribe of slaves.
They serve the Turks.

694
01:28:49,280 --> 01:28:51,240
Well, they are nothing to me.

695
01:28:51,480 --> 01:28:53,280
My tribe is the Howeitat.

696
01:28:53,480 --> 01:28:55,760
Who work only for profit.

697
01:28:55,960 --> 01:28:57,520
Who work at Auda's pleasure.

698
01:28:57,720 --> 01:29:00,240
And Auda's pleasure is
to serve the Turks.

699
01:29:00,440 --> 01:29:01,560
Serve?

700
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:03,000
I serve?

701
01:29:03,200 --> 01:29:05,760
It is the servant who takes money.

702
01:29:10,840 --> 01:29:12,480
I am Auda Abu Tayi.

703
01:29:12,760 --> 01:29:14,520
- Does Auda serve?
- No!

704
01:29:14,680 --> 01:29:17,720
- Does Auda Abu Tayi serve?
- No!

705
01:29:22,200 --> 01:29:26,120
I carry 23 great wounds,
all got in battle.

706
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:29,920
75 men have I killed with
my own hands, in battle.

707
01:29:30,120 --> 01:29:34,160
I scatter, I burn my enemies tents.
I take away their flocks and herds.

708
01:29:34,360 --> 01:29:38,280
The Turks pay me a golden treasure,
yet I am poor!

709
01:29:38,520 --> 01:29:42,480
Because I am a river to my people.

710
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:51,960
Is that service?

711
01:29:52,480 --> 01:29:53,720
No.

712
01:30:00,160 --> 01:30:03,520
And yet now it seems Auda
has grown old.

713
01:30:03,720 --> 01:30:06,320
And lost his taste for fighting.

714
01:30:06,520 --> 01:30:10,520
It is well you say it in my tent,
thou old tulip.

715
01:30:10,720 --> 01:30:14,360
Yet this is a tulip
that the Turks could not buy.

716
01:30:14,520 --> 01:30:16,280
Why should they wish to?

717
01:30:18,360 --> 01:30:19,360
Now...

718
01:30:19,960 --> 01:30:23,960
I will tell you what they pay me,
and you will tell me if this is...

719
01:30:24,160 --> 01:30:26,360
...a servant's wages.

720
01:30:26,520 --> 01:30:30,360
They pay me, month by month...

721
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:34,480
...100 golden guineas.

722
01:30:35,640 --> 01:30:38,680
150, Auda.

723
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:41,720
- Who told you that?
- I have long ears.

724
01:30:41,880 --> 01:30:44,120
And a long tongue between them.

725
01:30:44,280 --> 01:30:47,520
100, 150, what matters?
It's a trifle.

726
01:30:47,720 --> 01:30:51,360
A trifle which they take
from a great box they have.

727
01:30:51,560 --> 01:30:53,480
In Aqaba.

728
01:30:54,680 --> 01:30:57,280
- In Aqaba?
- Where else?

729
01:30:58,160 --> 01:31:00,920
You trouble me like women.

730
01:31:01,240 --> 01:31:04,280
Friends, we've been foolish.
Auda will not come to Aqaba.

731
01:31:04,920 --> 01:31:06,000
- For money?
- No.

732
01:31:06,360 --> 01:31:07,480
- For Feisal?
- No!

733
01:31:07,680 --> 01:31:10,640
Nor to drive away the Turks.

734
01:31:11,360 --> 01:31:13,160
He will come...

735
01:31:14,040 --> 01:31:16,280
...because it is his pleasure.

736
01:31:18,200 --> 01:31:21,680
Thy mother mated with a scorpion.

737
01:31:23,040 --> 01:31:26,360
Make God your agent!

738
01:31:27,640 --> 01:31:29,720
Aqaba!

739
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:31,520
Aqaba!

740
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:48,480
God be with you.

741
01:31:51,320 --> 01:31:52,920
God be with you.

742
01:32:05,880 --> 01:32:08,280
God be with you.

743
01:32:08,720 --> 01:32:10,680
God be with you.

744
01:34:59,040 --> 01:35:00,440
Yes.

745
01:35:00,760 --> 01:35:01,760
Aqaba.

746
01:35:03,320 --> 01:35:05,880
Tomorrow we will go and get it.

747
01:35:07,040 --> 01:35:09,880
- Do you think we shall?
- Yes.

748
01:35:10,040 --> 01:35:12,680
If you are right about the guns.

749
01:35:39,480 --> 01:35:42,080
He killed. He dies.

750
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:44,880
This is the end of Aqaba.

751
01:35:47,480 --> 01:35:49,240
One of our men
murdered Auda's man.

752
01:35:49,400 --> 01:35:50,360
Why?

753
01:35:50,560 --> 01:35:53,480
Theft? Blood feud?
It makes no matter why.

754
01:35:53,920 --> 01:35:55,080
Ali!

755
01:35:55,480 --> 01:35:57,240
It is an ancient wound.

756
01:35:57,440 --> 01:36:00,280
I didn't come here to watch
a tribal bloodbath.

757
01:36:04,600 --> 01:36:06,640
It is the law, Lawrence.

758
01:36:06,840 --> 01:36:09,080
The law says the man must die.

759
01:36:09,960 --> 01:36:12,880
If he dies, will that
content the Howeitat?

760
01:36:13,880 --> 01:36:15,080
Yes.

761
01:36:18,400 --> 01:36:19,920
Sherif Ali!

762
01:36:20,120 --> 01:36:23,000
If none of Lord Auda's men harms
any of yours...

763
01:36:23,360 --> 01:36:26,480
...will that content the Harith?
- Yes.

764
01:36:32,360 --> 01:36:34,880
Then I will execute the law.

765
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:37,880
I have no tribe.

766
01:36:39,080 --> 01:36:41,280
And no one is offended.

767
01:36:53,240 --> 01:36:54,200
Gasim.

768
01:36:58,520 --> 01:36:59,880
Did you do it?

769
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:27,320
Well, Lawrence...

770
01:37:34,520 --> 01:37:35,840
What ails the Englishman?

771
01:37:36,080 --> 01:37:39,360
That that he killed was the man
he brought out of the Nefud.

772
01:37:39,560 --> 01:37:41,480
It was written, then.

773
01:37:42,320 --> 01:37:44,240
Better to have left him.

774
01:37:47,720 --> 01:37:50,880
It was execution, Lawrence.
No shame in that.

775
01:37:51,320 --> 01:37:53,480
Besides, it was necessary.

776
01:37:54,520 --> 01:37:56,640
You gave life and you took it.

777
01:37:57,200 --> 01:37:58,680
The writing is still yours.

778
01:38:34,360 --> 01:38:36,360
Auda Abu Tayi!

779
01:41:44,360 --> 01:41:46,520
The miracle is accomplished.

780
01:41:47,480 --> 01:41:49,040
Garlands for the conqueror.

781
01:42:09,320 --> 01:42:12,320
Tribute for the prince.
Flowers for the man.

782
01:42:13,120 --> 01:42:14,720
I'm none of those things, Ali.

783
01:42:14,960 --> 01:42:17,480
- What, then?
- Don't know.

784
01:42:18,520 --> 01:42:19,760
Thanks.

785
01:42:21,280 --> 01:42:23,320
My God, I love this country.

786
01:42:24,920 --> 01:42:25,880
What!

787
01:42:26,920 --> 01:42:28,680
No gold in Aqaba!

788
01:42:29,960 --> 01:42:32,320
Auda, I found it!

789
01:42:41,160 --> 01:42:42,720
That's a pity.

790
01:42:46,120 --> 01:42:48,560
Ali, get a message
down the coast to Yenbo.

791
01:42:48,760 --> 01:42:51,160
Tell Feisal to find boats,
any boats...

792
01:42:51,360 --> 01:42:54,400
...and bring the Arab army here
to Aqaba, quickly.

793
01:42:54,600 --> 01:42:55,680
And you?

794
01:42:56,480 --> 01:42:58,880
I'm going to tell the generals...

795
01:42:59,360 --> 01:43:01,120
...in Cairo.

796
01:43:01,320 --> 01:43:03,520
Yes, cross Sinai.

797
01:43:03,800 --> 01:43:04,800
Come on!

798
01:43:05,120 --> 01:43:06,400
Sinai?

799
01:43:06,880 --> 01:43:08,160
Yes.

800
01:43:08,640 --> 01:43:12,160
- With these?
- They'll be all right with me.

801
01:43:17,240 --> 01:43:21,200
Look, Ali. If any of your Bedouin
arrived in Cairo and said:

802
01:43:21,520 --> 01:43:24,240
"We've taken Aqaba,"
the generals would laugh.

803
01:43:24,960 --> 01:43:26,240
I see.

804
01:43:26,800 --> 01:43:29,840
In Cairo you will put off
these funny clothes.

805
01:43:30,080 --> 01:43:34,080
You'll wear trousers and tell stories
of our quaintness and barbarity...

806
01:43:34,720 --> 01:43:36,880
...and then they will believe you.

807
01:43:37,440 --> 01:43:39,480
You're an ignorant man.

808
01:43:58,800 --> 01:44:00,200
Paper.

809
01:44:01,080 --> 01:44:02,800
Paper!

810
01:44:05,480 --> 01:44:08,000
There is no gold in Aqaba.

811
01:44:09,080 --> 01:44:10,840
No gold.

812
01:44:12,200 --> 01:44:14,080
No great box!

813
01:44:18,120 --> 01:44:20,360
Did Auda come to Aqaba for gold?

814
01:44:20,920 --> 01:44:23,120
For my pleasure, as you said.

815
01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:26,720
But gold is honorable...

816
01:44:27,800 --> 01:44:30,360
...and Lawrence promised gold.

817
01:44:31,400 --> 01:44:32,520
Lawrence lied.

818
01:44:34,400 --> 01:44:35,800
See, Auda.

819
01:44:38,360 --> 01:44:40,400
"The Crown of England...

820
01:44:41,480 --> 01:44:43,840
...promises to pay...

821
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:49,040
...5000 golden guineas...

822
01:44:49,520 --> 01:44:54,040
...to Auda Abu Tayi."

823
01:44:55,160 --> 01:44:59,280
Signed in His Majesty's absence...

824
01:44:59,560 --> 01:45:00,920
...by...

825
01:45:02,560 --> 01:45:03,720
...me.

826
01:45:04,800 --> 01:45:06,840
In 10 days...

827
01:45:07,560 --> 01:45:09,560
...I'll be back with the gold.

828
01:45:10,640 --> 01:45:15,200
With gold, with guns, with everything.

829
01:45:15,320 --> 01:45:16,840
Ten days.

830
01:45:18,080 --> 01:45:19,640
You'll cross Sinai?

831
01:45:19,960 --> 01:45:21,240
Why not?

832
01:45:21,960 --> 01:45:23,640
Moses did.

833
01:45:26,200 --> 01:45:28,280
And you will take the children?

834
01:45:29,520 --> 01:45:30,880
Moses did.

835
01:45:31,120 --> 01:45:32,720
Moses was a prophet...

836
01:45:33,240 --> 01:45:35,720
...and beloved of God.

837
01:45:40,840 --> 01:45:44,800
He said there was gold here.
He lied.

838
01:45:46,080 --> 01:45:48,800
He is not perfect.

839
01:45:58,560 --> 01:46:00,880
Lord, can we not rest?

840
01:46:01,080 --> 01:46:04,080
I told you, no rest till
they know that I have Aqaba.

841
01:46:06,280 --> 01:46:07,880
Have you two slept in beds?

842
01:46:08,120 --> 01:46:09,320
Farraj?

843
01:46:09,920 --> 01:46:11,160
Daud?

844
01:46:12,320 --> 01:46:13,960
With sheets?

845
01:46:15,800 --> 01:46:19,120
Tomorrow the finest sheets
in the finest room and hotel in Cairo.

846
01:46:19,360 --> 01:46:20,600
I promise.

847
01:46:20,880 --> 01:46:23,400
Then it shall be so, lord.

848
01:46:43,720 --> 01:46:45,040
Look!

849
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:53,080
Pillar of fire.

850
01:46:56,160 --> 01:46:58,080
No, lord. Dust.

851
01:47:45,920 --> 01:47:47,360
My compass.

852
01:47:49,120 --> 01:47:50,360
No matter.

853
01:47:50,800 --> 01:47:54,360
If we ride west,
we must strike the canal.

854
01:47:54,640 --> 01:47:55,960
Due west.

855
01:48:16,320 --> 01:48:17,720
Come on!

856
01:48:49,800 --> 01:48:52,320
Lawrence!

857
01:49:04,520 --> 01:49:05,760
Farraj!

858
01:49:15,600 --> 01:49:18,360
Farraj, don't! Don't!

859
01:49:19,400 --> 01:49:20,760
Don't!

860
01:50:52,280 --> 01:50:53,440
Why do you walk?

861
01:50:56,080 --> 01:50:57,920
But why, lord?

862
01:51:08,760 --> 01:51:10,000
But why, lord?

863
01:51:10,200 --> 01:51:13,520
There is room for both.
It serves no purpose.

864
01:51:38,200 --> 01:51:40,600
Lawrence, look!

865
01:52:46,720 --> 01:52:48,680
It's all right, Farraj.

866
01:52:48,880 --> 01:52:50,360
It's all right.

867
01:53:59,320 --> 01:54:01,160
Who are you?

868
01:54:03,160 --> 01:54:05,760
Who are you?

869
01:54:39,720 --> 01:54:42,200
- Daud!
- We're here, sir.

870
01:54:59,640 --> 01:55:01,160
You taking him in there?

871
01:55:02,240 --> 01:55:03,560
Yes.

872
01:55:23,240 --> 01:55:24,600
Here!

873
01:55:26,440 --> 01:55:28,680
Here. You!

874
01:55:30,160 --> 01:55:33,520
And where the hell do you think
you're going to, Mustapha?

875
01:55:34,240 --> 01:55:35,680
We are thirsty.

876
01:55:37,400 --> 01:55:39,760
- Mr. Lawrence, is it?
- Yes.

877
01:55:40,200 --> 01:55:43,160
- Are you going to the officers' bar?
- Yes.

878
01:55:44,360 --> 01:55:46,560
You can't take him in there, sir.

879
01:55:50,040 --> 01:55:52,520
What do you think you look like?

880
01:56:10,440 --> 01:56:12,000
No, no. You must go.

881
01:56:12,200 --> 01:56:13,720
No, no. Go, effendi, go!

882
01:56:15,480 --> 01:56:18,160
Get out! You must get out! Get out!

883
01:56:19,720 --> 01:56:23,800
We want two large glasses
of lemonade.

884
01:56:24,040 --> 01:56:27,720
- This is a bar for British officers.
- We are not particular.

885
01:56:32,840 --> 01:56:36,600
- Are you off your head?
- No. Oddly enough I'm not.

886
01:56:36,840 --> 01:56:40,320
- Just clear out of here, will you?
- Get that boy out of here.

887
01:56:40,600 --> 01:56:43,200
Corporal, we'll have
this one out anyway.

888
01:56:43,840 --> 01:56:46,280
- Get that wog out of here.
- Clear off.

889
01:56:48,320 --> 01:56:49,960
What's going on?

890
01:56:52,800 --> 01:56:56,560
- It's Lawrence, sir.
- Lemonade with ice.

891
01:56:57,840 --> 01:56:59,360
Explain yourself.

892
01:57:00,040 --> 01:57:01,720
We've taken Aqaba.

893
01:57:02,240 --> 01:57:04,800
- Taken Aqaba? Who has?
- We have.

894
01:57:05,040 --> 01:57:09,360
Our side in this war has.
The wogs have.

895
01:57:10,040 --> 01:57:11,360
We have.

896
01:57:13,080 --> 01:57:14,840
He likes your lemonade.

897
01:57:15,160 --> 01:57:17,040
You mean the Turks have gone?

898
01:57:17,320 --> 01:57:20,120
No, they're still there
but they've no boots.

899
01:57:20,640 --> 01:57:24,560
Prisoners, sir. We took them
prisoners. The entire garrison.

900
01:57:25,080 --> 01:57:27,160
That's not true. We killed some.

901
01:57:27,400 --> 01:57:31,160
Too many, really.
I'll manage it better next time.

902
01:57:32,440 --> 01:57:35,240
There's been a lot of killing
one way or another.

903
01:57:37,240 --> 01:57:40,600
Cross my heart and hope to die,
it's all perfectly true.

904
01:57:40,840 --> 01:57:43,480
- It isn't possible.
- Yes, it is.

905
01:57:43,840 --> 01:57:45,560
I did it.

906
01:57:50,600 --> 01:57:52,200
You'd better talk to Allenby.

907
01:57:52,440 --> 01:57:55,120
- General Allenby?
- He's in command. Murray's gone.

908
01:57:55,320 --> 01:57:57,520
That's a step in the right direction.

909
01:57:58,240 --> 01:58:00,880
First I want a room.
With a bed, with sheets.

910
01:58:01,160 --> 01:58:03,760
- Yes, of course.
- It's for him.

911
01:58:05,400 --> 01:58:08,200
Right. You want a bed yourself,
don't you?

912
01:58:08,440 --> 01:58:10,360
See Allenby first, though.

913
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:12,560
Will he see me?

914
01:58:13,320 --> 01:58:14,760
I think so.

915
01:58:15,480 --> 01:58:16,960
Do that, then.

916
01:58:21,640 --> 01:58:24,160
- I'd better shave.
- Yes, you had.

917
01:58:24,360 --> 01:58:26,880
You'd better get into
some trousers too.

918
01:58:37,560 --> 01:58:39,360
"Undisciplined.

919
01:58:41,160 --> 01:58:43,040
Unpunctual.

920
01:58:44,120 --> 01:58:46,000
Untidy.

921
01:58:47,760 --> 01:58:49,800
Several languages.

922
01:58:51,040 --> 01:58:52,960
Knowledge of music...

923
01:58:53,800 --> 01:58:55,480
...literature.

924
01:58:56,520 --> 01:58:58,400
Knowledge of...

925
01:58:59,720 --> 01:59:01,400
Knowledge of..."

926
01:59:04,520 --> 01:59:07,360
You're an interesting man,
there's no doubt about it.

927
01:59:07,960 --> 01:59:10,960
- Who told you to take Aqaba?
- Nobody.

928
01:59:11,240 --> 01:59:13,800
- Sir.
- Sir.

929
01:59:14,040 --> 01:59:15,320
Then why did you?

930
01:59:15,520 --> 01:59:17,920
- Aqaba's important.
- Why is it important?

931
01:59:18,120 --> 01:59:20,560
- It's the Turkish route to the canal.
- Not anymore.

932
01:59:20,760 --> 01:59:24,760
- They're coming through Beersheba.
- I know, but we've gone to Gaza.

933
01:59:24,960 --> 01:59:29,360
- So?
- So that left Aqaba behind your right.

934
01:59:29,920 --> 01:59:30,920
True.

935
01:59:31,120 --> 01:59:35,560
And it will be further behind your
right when you go for Jerusalem.

936
01:59:36,400 --> 01:59:38,680
Am I going for Jerusalem?

937
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:40,160
Yes.

938
01:59:42,400 --> 01:59:43,800
Very well.

939
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:46,200
Aqaba behind my right.

940
01:59:46,400 --> 01:59:49,160
It threatened EI' Arish and Gaza.

941
01:59:50,560 --> 01:59:51,760
Anything else?

942
01:59:51,960 --> 01:59:53,160
Yes.

943
01:59:53,440 --> 01:59:55,800
Aqaba's linked with Medina.

944
01:59:56,280 --> 01:59:59,200
Do you think we should shift them
out of Medina now?

945
01:59:59,440 --> 02:00:02,840
No. I think you should
leave them there.

946
02:00:03,040 --> 02:00:04,960
You acted without orders, you know.

947
02:00:05,640 --> 02:00:09,720
Shouldn't officers use
their initiative at all times?

948
02:00:09,880 --> 02:00:12,160
Not really. It's awfully dangerous.

949
02:00:12,360 --> 02:00:14,600
Yes, I know.

950
02:00:14,840 --> 02:00:16,360
Already?

951
02:00:16,600 --> 02:00:17,760
Yes.

952
02:00:19,440 --> 02:00:21,960
I'm promoting you major.

953
02:00:22,920 --> 02:00:25,080
I don't think that's a very good idea.

954
02:00:25,280 --> 02:00:28,240
I didn't ask you.
I want you to go back...

955
02:00:28,440 --> 02:00:31,960
...and carry on the good work.

956
02:00:32,440 --> 02:00:35,160
No. Thank you, sir.

957
02:00:35,640 --> 02:00:39,440
- Why not?
- Well, I, it's...

958
02:00:39,640 --> 02:00:40,960
Let me see now...

959
02:00:42,600 --> 02:00:46,200
I killed two people.
I mean, two Arabs.

960
02:00:46,360 --> 02:00:48,520
One was a boy.

961
02:00:48,720 --> 02:00:50,120
That was...

962
02:00:51,640 --> 02:00:53,440
...yesterday.

963
02:00:53,640 --> 02:00:55,600
I led him into a quicksand.

964
02:00:55,840 --> 02:00:57,440
The other was a man.

965
02:00:57,760 --> 02:00:59,640
That was...

966
02:00:59,800 --> 02:01:02,160
...before Aqaba, anyway.

967
02:01:02,800 --> 02:01:05,400
I had to execute him with my pistol.

968
02:01:05,880 --> 02:01:08,800
There was something about it
I didn't like.

969
02:01:09,040 --> 02:01:12,040
- Well, naturally.
- No. Something else.

970
02:01:14,200 --> 02:01:16,480
That's all right.
Let it be a warning.

971
02:01:16,680 --> 02:01:18,680
No. Something else.

972
02:01:20,280 --> 02:01:21,800
What, then?

973
02:01:22,680 --> 02:01:24,920
I enjoyed it.

974
02:01:32,120 --> 02:01:35,520
Rubbish. Rubbish and nerves.
You're tired.

975
02:01:37,200 --> 02:01:40,680
What do you mean coming dressed
like that? Amateur theatricals?

976
02:01:40,920 --> 02:01:42,520
Yes. Entirely.

977
02:01:42,760 --> 02:01:45,760
Let me see that hat thing
or whatever it is.

978
02:01:46,040 --> 02:01:48,000
Fascinating gear they wear.

979
02:01:48,240 --> 02:01:50,400
How would I look in this, Harry?

980
02:01:50,600 --> 02:01:53,960
- Damn ridiculous, sir.
- Here, you keep it.

981
02:01:54,840 --> 02:01:58,760
What I'm trying to say
is I don't think I'm fit for it.

982
02:01:58,960 --> 02:02:01,720
Really? What do you think, Dryden?

983
02:02:02,720 --> 02:02:07,120
Before he did it, sir, I'd have said
it couldn't be done.

984
02:02:07,440 --> 02:02:10,320
- Brighton?
- I know what he thinks.

985
02:02:11,440 --> 02:02:14,640
I think you should recommend
a decoration, sir.

986
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:17,760
I don't think it matters
what his motives were.

987
02:02:17,960 --> 02:02:20,960
It was a brilliant bit of soldiering.

988
02:02:22,440 --> 02:02:24,240
- Mr. Perkins!
- Sir!

989
02:02:24,440 --> 02:02:26,960
Let's have a drink, gentlemen.

990
02:02:30,840 --> 02:02:34,120
- You've heard about this, Mr. Perkins?
- Yes, sir.

991
02:02:34,320 --> 02:02:38,440
- What do you think about it?
- Bloody marvellous, sir. Well done.

992
02:02:38,640 --> 02:02:41,560
- Thank you, Mr. Perkins.
- Sir!

993
02:02:47,040 --> 02:02:48,560
Come on, then.

994
02:02:52,040 --> 02:02:53,760
You're a clever man, sir.

995
02:02:54,040 --> 02:02:57,520
No, but I know a good thing
when I see one.

996
02:02:57,760 --> 02:03:00,360
That's fair, surely?

997
02:03:20,040 --> 02:03:24,920
If I need a breakthrough to Jerusalem,
I must concentrate, not dissipate.

998
02:03:25,160 --> 02:03:27,360
- Bravo.
- You know better?

999
02:03:46,120 --> 02:03:48,840
I fight like Clausewitz,
then you fight like Saxe.

1000
02:03:49,080 --> 02:03:51,360
We should do very well indeed,
shouldn't we?

1001
02:04:26,440 --> 02:04:28,760
Easy, gentlemen, please.

1002
02:04:29,920 --> 02:04:32,040
- Give us something to drink.
- Of course, sir.

1003
02:04:32,520 --> 02:04:35,960
I'm here at the invitation
of Major Lawrence.

1004
02:04:36,720 --> 02:04:37,840
Tracy.

1005
02:04:39,640 --> 02:04:41,440
Shall we go outside?

1006
02:04:52,120 --> 02:04:55,320
So you hold bound the Turkish
desert army?

1007
02:04:55,520 --> 02:04:56,520
Yes.

1008
02:04:56,760 --> 02:04:56,800
With 1000 Arabs?

1009
02:04:56,800 --> 02:04:58,960
With 1000 Arabs?

1010
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:03,000
1000 Arabs means 1000 knives.

1011
02:05:03,200 --> 02:05:05,120
Delivered anywhere, day or night.

1012
02:05:05,640 --> 02:05:07,240
It means 1000 camels.

1013
02:05:07,520 --> 02:05:11,640
That means 1000 packs of high
explosives and 1000 crack rifles.

1014
02:05:12,120 --> 02:05:15,760
We can cross Arabia while
Johnny Turk is still turning round.

1015
02:05:16,320 --> 02:05:18,160
I'll smash his railways.

1016
02:05:18,360 --> 02:05:20,800
While he mends,
I'll smash them somewhere else.

1017
02:05:21,040 --> 02:05:23,720
In 13 weeks I can have
Arabia in chaos.

1018
02:05:23,960 --> 02:05:26,240
You are going back, then?

1019
02:05:28,960 --> 02:05:30,160
Yes.

1020
02:05:30,520 --> 02:05:32,760
Of course I'm going back.

1021
02:05:36,920 --> 02:05:39,280
Well, if we can see it,
so can the Turk.

1022
02:05:39,520 --> 02:05:43,600
If he finds he's using four divisions
to fend off a handful of bandits...

1023
02:05:43,800 --> 02:05:44,920
...he'll withdraw.

1024
02:05:45,120 --> 02:05:47,760
He daren't withdraw.
Arabia's part of his empire.

1025
02:05:47,960 --> 02:05:50,400
If he gets out now,
he'll never get back again.

1026
02:05:50,640 --> 02:05:53,040
- I wonder who will.
- No one will.

1027
02:05:53,640 --> 02:05:55,800
Arabia's for the Arabs now.

1028
02:06:01,560 --> 02:06:03,760
That's what I've told them anyway.

1029
02:06:04,200 --> 02:06:05,960
That's what they think.

1030
02:06:06,400 --> 02:06:09,520
- That's why they're fighting.
- Oh, surely.

1031
02:06:12,360 --> 02:06:14,560
They've only one suspicion.

1032
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:19,160
That we'll let them drive the Turks
out and then move in ourselves.

1033
02:06:19,400 --> 02:06:23,720
I've told them that that's false,
that we have no ambitions in Arabia.

1034
02:06:23,920 --> 02:06:24,920
Have we?

1035
02:06:25,440 --> 02:06:27,520
I'm not a politician, thank God.

1036
02:06:27,720 --> 02:06:30,720
Have we any ambition
in Arabia, Dryden?

1037
02:06:31,640 --> 02:06:33,840
Difficult question, sir.

1038
02:06:35,760 --> 02:06:39,400
I want to know, sir,
if I can tell them in your name...

1039
02:06:39,600 --> 02:06:42,840
...that we've no ambitions in Arabia.

1040
02:06:43,880 --> 02:06:45,320
Certainly.

1041
02:07:02,120 --> 02:07:05,440
2000 small arms, not enough.
I need five.

1042
02:07:05,640 --> 02:07:06,760
Right.

1043
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:10,240
Money. It'll have to be sovereigns.
They don't like paper.

1044
02:07:11,200 --> 02:07:14,440
- Instructors for the Lewis guns.
- Right.

1045
02:07:14,640 --> 02:07:16,160
More money.

1046
02:07:16,440 --> 02:07:19,520
- How much more?
- 25,000 now. A lot more later.

1047
02:07:19,720 --> 02:07:22,320
- Dryden?
- It can be done, sir.

1048
02:07:22,520 --> 02:07:25,240
A couple of armoured cars.

1049
02:07:25,440 --> 02:07:26,760
Right.

1050
02:07:27,480 --> 02:07:28,960
Field artillery.

1051
02:07:31,040 --> 02:07:32,360
Right.

1052
02:07:35,160 --> 02:07:37,360
I'll give you every
blessed thing I can...

1053
02:07:37,560 --> 02:07:40,360
...because I know you'll use it.
Congratulations.

1054
02:07:40,560 --> 02:07:43,160
Thank you for your hospitality,
gentlemen.

1055
02:08:17,400 --> 02:08:19,160
Congratulations!

1056
02:08:29,040 --> 02:08:32,000
Are you really going to give them
artillery, sir?

1057
02:08:32,200 --> 02:08:33,960
I was wondering that, sir.

1058
02:08:34,200 --> 02:08:36,280
Might be difficult to get it back.

1059
02:08:36,520 --> 02:08:39,920
Give them artillery and you've made
them independent.

1060
02:08:40,120 --> 02:08:42,000
Then I can't give it to them, can I?

1061
02:08:42,240 --> 02:08:44,080
- For you to say.
- No, it's not.

1062
02:08:44,320 --> 02:08:46,960
I've got orders to obey, thank God.

1063
02:08:47,160 --> 02:08:49,080
Not like that poor devil.

1064
02:08:49,560 --> 02:08:51,040
He's riding the whirlwind.

1065
02:08:51,240 --> 02:08:53,400
Let's hope we're not.

1066
02:09:40,160 --> 02:09:43,240
Excuse me, friend.
Who do these bags belong to?

1067
02:09:43,760 --> 02:09:44,960
To Prince Feisal.

1068
02:09:45,160 --> 02:09:47,840
- You're not Prince Feisal?
- No.

1069
02:09:48,080 --> 02:09:49,360
You know him though?

1070
02:09:49,560 --> 02:09:52,880
He is my master. I am his servant.

1071
02:09:55,960 --> 02:09:57,200
Can you read?

1072
02:10:05,520 --> 02:10:09,840
Chicago Courier is my paper,
but my work is syndicated in America.

1073
02:10:10,080 --> 02:10:13,480
I understood so from your letter,
Mr. Bentley.

1074
02:10:27,080 --> 02:10:28,200
Now...

1075
02:10:29,360 --> 02:10:33,160
- Where can I find Major Lawrence?
- Is that what you have come for?

1076
02:10:33,360 --> 02:10:35,400
Not altogether, sir, no.

1077
02:10:35,680 --> 02:10:39,840
Well, Mr. Bentley, you will find
Major Lawrence with my army.

1078
02:10:40,040 --> 02:10:43,000
That's what I meant, sir.
Where can I find your army?

1079
02:10:43,280 --> 02:10:44,400
I don't know.

1080
02:10:45,040 --> 02:10:47,600
- Last week they were near El Ghira.
- Ghira?

1081
02:10:47,840 --> 02:10:51,520
Yes, I fear you have a long journey.
Can you ride a camel?

1082
02:10:52,440 --> 02:10:54,920
- I've never tried.
- Take a mule.

1083
02:10:55,480 --> 02:10:57,480
Avoid Mellaha, the Turks are there.

1084
02:10:57,880 --> 02:11:00,360
In Mellaha now? They move fast.

1085
02:11:00,560 --> 02:11:01,800
They do.

1086
02:11:02,040 --> 02:11:05,080
But not so fast as we do,
you will find.

1087
02:11:05,400 --> 02:11:06,800
Myself...

1088
02:11:07,400 --> 02:11:09,240
...I am going to Cairo.

1089
02:11:09,440 --> 02:11:11,320
- As you know.
- Yes.

1090
02:11:11,560 --> 02:11:13,960
There's work for me there
of a different kind.

1091
02:11:14,480 --> 02:11:15,640
Yes.

1092
02:11:19,080 --> 02:11:21,360
I understand you've
been given no artillery.

1093
02:11:21,800 --> 02:11:24,240
- That is so.
- You're handicapped?

1094
02:11:24,440 --> 02:11:26,400
It restricts us to small things.

1095
02:11:26,600 --> 02:11:27,840
It's intended to.

1096
02:11:30,440 --> 02:11:31,960
Do you know General Allenby?

1097
02:11:32,960 --> 02:11:36,280
Watch out for Allenby.
He's a slim customer.

1098
02:11:36,560 --> 02:11:39,160
- Excuse me?
- A clever man.

1099
02:11:39,400 --> 02:11:42,200
Slim customer. It's very good.

1100
02:11:42,440 --> 02:11:46,840
I'll certainly watch out for him.
You're being very sympathetic.

1101
02:11:47,080 --> 02:11:50,440
Your Highness, we Americans were
once a colonial people.

1102
02:11:50,640 --> 02:11:52,960
We naturally feel
sympathetic to any people...

1103
02:11:53,160 --> 02:11:55,280
...who struggle for their freedom.

1104
02:11:55,480 --> 02:11:57,600
Very gratifying.

1105
02:12:00,240 --> 02:12:04,400
Also, my interests are the same
as yours. You want your story told.

1106
02:12:04,600 --> 02:12:06,800
I badly want a story to tell.

1107
02:12:07,040 --> 02:12:10,640
Ah, now you are talking turkey,
are you not?

1108
02:12:11,280 --> 02:12:14,040
I will give you a guide and a letter.

1109
02:12:14,240 --> 02:12:16,120
And before I leave here...

1110
02:12:16,360 --> 02:12:18,600
...which must be presently...

1111
02:12:18,800 --> 02:12:22,200
...I will have some facts and figures
put on paper for you.

1112
02:12:23,880 --> 02:12:27,040
You know that we are
destroying the Turkish railways.

1113
02:12:27,240 --> 02:12:28,320
I do, sir.

1114
02:12:28,520 --> 02:12:31,360
Major Lawrence is in charge
of all this, is he?

1115
02:12:31,560 --> 02:12:33,960
My army is made up of tribes.

1116
02:12:34,160 --> 02:12:37,040
The tribes are led
by the tribal leaders.

1117
02:12:37,240 --> 02:12:40,280
Your people do think very highly
of Major Lawrence?

1118
02:12:40,480 --> 02:12:43,400
Oh, yes. And the rightly.

1119
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:47,200
In this country, Mr. Bentley...

1120
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:51,280
...the man who gives victory
in battle is prized...

1121
02:12:51,480 --> 02:12:54,000
...beyond every other man.

1122
02:12:54,680 --> 02:12:57,680
One figure I can give you
from my head...

1123
02:12:57,880 --> 02:13:01,400
...because it never leaves my head.

1124
02:13:01,880 --> 02:13:05,760
Since starting this campaign
four months ago, we have lost...

1125
02:13:06,680 --> 02:13:09,000
...37 wounded...

1126
02:13:11,440 --> 02:13:14,640
...156 dead.

1127
02:13:16,160 --> 02:13:20,760
You remark the disproportion between
our dead and wounded.

1128
02:13:20,960 --> 02:13:22,200
Yeah.

1129
02:13:22,480 --> 02:13:23,840
Four times as many.

1130
02:13:24,040 --> 02:13:28,600
That's because those too wounded
to bring away, we ourselves kill.

1131
02:13:28,800 --> 02:13:31,200
We leave no wounded for the Turks.

1132
02:13:31,640 --> 02:13:35,160
- You mean?
- We leave no wounded for the Turks.

1133
02:13:35,640 --> 02:13:38,880
In their eyes, we are not
soldiers but rebels.

1134
02:13:39,080 --> 02:13:43,400
Rebels, wounded or whole, are
not protected by the Geneva Code...

1135
02:13:43,600 --> 02:13:45,440
...and are treated harshly.

1136
02:13:46,080 --> 02:13:47,160
How harshly?

1137
02:13:47,400 --> 02:13:50,200
More harshly than I hope
you can imagine.

1138
02:13:50,920 --> 02:13:51,920
I see.

1139
02:13:52,120 --> 02:13:55,200
Our own prisoners are taken care of
until the British...

1140
02:13:55,400 --> 02:13:59,080
...can relieve us of them,
according to the Code.

1141
02:13:59,280 --> 02:14:03,160
- I should like you to notice that.
- Yes, sir.

1142
02:14:04,160 --> 02:14:06,680
Is that the influence
of Major Lawrence?

1143
02:14:07,080 --> 02:14:08,440
Why should you suppose?

1144
02:14:08,640 --> 02:14:11,000
It's just that I heard
in Cairo that...

1145
02:14:11,200 --> 02:14:13,560
...Major Lawrence has
a horror of bloodshed.

1146
02:14:13,760 --> 02:14:15,360
That is exactly so.

1147
02:14:15,560 --> 02:14:18,920
With Major Lawrence,
mercy is a passion.

1148
02:14:19,240 --> 02:14:22,000
With me, it is merely good manners.

1149
02:14:22,200 --> 02:14:26,160
You may judge which motive
is the more reliable.

1150
02:14:26,760 --> 02:14:30,040
- And now, perhaps...
- Oh, sure, sure.

1151
02:14:33,960 --> 02:14:35,560
Thank you, sir.

1152
02:14:35,760 --> 02:14:37,440
Can you manage the letter...?

1153
02:14:37,680 --> 02:14:40,440
I'll do everything I have said...

1154
02:14:40,640 --> 02:14:44,040
...if you will tell me truly
the nature of your interest...

1155
02:14:44,280 --> 02:14:46,560
...in my people and Major Lawrence.

1156
02:14:48,400 --> 02:14:51,400
It's very simple, sir.
I'm looking for a hero.

1157
02:14:51,600 --> 02:14:54,040
Indeed.
You do not seem a romantic man.

1158
02:14:54,320 --> 02:14:55,320
Oh, no.

1159
02:14:55,560 --> 02:14:59,200
But influential men back home believe
it's time for America...

1160
02:14:59,400 --> 02:15:02,040
...to lend her weight to
the struggle against Germany.

1161
02:15:02,240 --> 02:15:04,120
And Turkey.

1162
02:15:04,440 --> 02:15:08,560
I've been sent to find material to
show our people that this war is...

1163
02:15:09,080 --> 02:15:11,400
- Enjoyable?
- Hardly that, sir.

1164
02:15:11,600 --> 02:15:14,520
But to show it in its
more adventurous aspects.

1165
02:15:14,720 --> 02:15:18,160
You look for a figure who
will draw your country towards war.

1166
02:15:19,680 --> 02:15:21,440
All right. Yes.

1167
02:15:22,040 --> 02:15:23,600
Lawrence is your man.

1168
02:16:01,840 --> 02:16:02,840
Stop!

1169
02:16:21,440 --> 02:16:23,000
Stop it!

1170
02:16:23,760 --> 02:16:25,120
Stop it!

1171
02:16:32,960 --> 02:16:34,360
Come on, men!

1172
02:17:40,760 --> 02:17:42,000
Lawrence!

1173
02:18:01,880 --> 02:18:03,800
Good God! God!

1174
02:18:48,240 --> 02:18:52,840
Jiminy! Never seen a man killed
with a sword before.

1175
02:18:53,120 --> 02:18:55,240
Why don't you take a picture?

1176
02:18:55,640 --> 02:18:56,840
Wish I had.

1177
02:19:00,920 --> 02:19:03,000
How is it with thee, Lawrence?

1178
02:19:05,160 --> 02:19:06,160
Am I in this?

1179
02:19:07,120 --> 02:19:08,760
Did you take his picture?

1180
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:10,200
Yeah.

1181
02:19:14,440 --> 02:19:18,440
You are using up your nine lives
very quickly.

1182
02:19:20,840 --> 02:19:22,800
Charming company you keep.

1183
02:19:23,040 --> 02:19:24,240
Auda?

1184
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:29,840
He's a bit old-fashioned. He thinks
these things will steal his virtue.

1185
02:19:30,200 --> 02:19:32,160
He thinks you're a kind of thief.

1186
02:19:32,400 --> 02:19:34,440
It's all right to take your picture?

1187
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:36,440
- All right.
- Okay.

1188
02:19:36,640 --> 02:19:38,040
Just walk.

1189
02:20:35,800 --> 02:20:37,840
Major Lawrence!

1190
02:20:38,440 --> 02:20:41,040
Yes, sir, that's my baby.

1191
02:20:48,720 --> 02:20:51,240
This looting has got to stop!

1192
02:20:51,480 --> 02:20:52,760
It is customary.

1193
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:56,440
It's theft. And theft makes thieves.

1194
02:20:56,680 --> 02:20:58,840
I would not say that to Auda.

1195
02:20:59,320 --> 02:21:01,960
- It is their payment, colonel.
- Payment.

1196
02:21:02,200 --> 02:21:04,840
Truly. Are not British soldiers paid?

1197
02:21:05,720 --> 02:21:08,880
- They don't go home when being paid.
- They are not free to.

1198
02:21:13,480 --> 02:21:17,400
Well, there's another lot you've
seen the last of.

1199
02:21:17,680 --> 02:21:19,240
They'll come back.

1200
02:21:20,040 --> 02:21:22,880
He says they'll come back.
Will they?

1201
02:21:23,120 --> 02:21:25,240
Not this year, Lawrence.

1202
02:21:25,920 --> 02:21:30,160
Look, Lawrence, how many men do
you think you'll have left? 200?

1203
02:21:30,400 --> 02:21:33,040
- Less.
- Well, then?

1204
02:21:33,400 --> 02:21:35,640
I said, they'll come back.

1205
02:21:36,320 --> 02:21:37,440
You badly hurt?

1206
02:21:38,920 --> 02:21:40,600
Not hurt at all.

1207
02:21:40,840 --> 02:21:44,840
Didn't you know? They can only
kill me with a golden bullet.

1208
02:21:59,920 --> 02:22:03,640
It is for children.
I have set myself to learn again.

1209
02:22:04,040 --> 02:22:07,440
- What are you learning from this?
- Politics.

1210
02:22:08,120 --> 02:22:12,400
You'll be a democracy in this country?
You gonna have a parliament?

1211
02:22:13,040 --> 02:22:15,240
I will tell you that
when I have a country.

1212
02:22:17,440 --> 02:22:18,680
Did I answer well?

1213
02:22:19,040 --> 02:22:23,040
You answered without
saying anything. That's politics.

1214
02:22:24,240 --> 02:22:25,880
You learn quickly.

1215
02:22:27,120 --> 02:22:29,240
I have a good teacher.

1216
02:22:31,720 --> 02:22:33,040
Yeah.

1217
02:22:40,480 --> 02:22:42,240
- How's your hurt?
- Fine.

1218
02:22:42,440 --> 02:22:47,080
Before I return to the fleshpots,
which I shall be very glad to do...

1219
02:22:47,320 --> 02:22:50,200
...may I put two questions to you,
straight?

1220
02:22:50,480 --> 02:22:53,680
I'd be interested to hear you put
a question straight.

1221
02:22:53,920 --> 02:22:55,000
One.

1222
02:22:55,480 --> 02:22:59,240
What, in your opinion, do these people
hope to gain from this war?

1223
02:22:59,520 --> 02:23:01,840
They hope to gain their freedom.

1224
02:23:03,120 --> 02:23:04,120
Freedom.

1225
02:23:05,320 --> 02:23:08,040
"They hope to gain their freedom."

1226
02:23:08,280 --> 02:23:11,800
- There's one born every minute.
- They're going to get it.

1227
02:23:12,520 --> 02:23:14,640
I'm going to give it to them.

1228
02:23:16,240 --> 02:23:21,840
- The second question?
- Well, I was going to ask...

1229
02:23:22,320 --> 02:23:26,120
...what is it that attracts you
personally to the desert?

1230
02:23:28,040 --> 02:23:30,040
It's clean.

1231
02:23:32,720 --> 02:23:34,200
Well, now...

1232
02:23:35,040 --> 02:23:37,080
...that's a very illuminating answer.

1233
02:23:37,440 --> 02:23:39,000
May I...

1234
02:23:39,640 --> 02:23:42,040
...take one farewell picture?

1235
02:23:42,800 --> 02:23:45,720
I gave Math Budad two lamps for it.

1236
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:48,840
One clock for two lamps.

1237
02:23:49,320 --> 02:23:50,480
A fair bargain.

1238
02:23:50,720 --> 02:23:53,240
Fair? I robbed him.

1239
02:24:04,200 --> 02:24:05,640
Trash.

1240
02:24:06,720 --> 02:24:09,080
I must find something honorable.

1241
02:24:09,320 --> 02:24:10,840
Honorable?

1242
02:24:11,400 --> 02:24:15,040
The year is running out, Brighton.

1243
02:24:19,240 --> 02:24:22,120
I must find something honorable.

1244
02:26:47,440 --> 02:26:49,560
Now you may blow up my train.

1245
02:26:49,800 --> 02:26:51,440
And what will you do now?

1246
02:26:51,680 --> 02:26:56,040
Now I go home.
They will carry my toys.

1247
02:26:56,800 --> 02:26:58,680
They will carry my toys too, see?

1248
02:26:59,080 --> 02:27:02,040
Major Lawrence will campaign
this winter.

1249
02:27:02,280 --> 02:27:05,520
But you got what you wanted,
so you're going home, is that it?

1250
02:27:05,720 --> 02:27:10,160
Of course. When Lawrence has got
what he wants, he will go home.

1251
02:27:10,400 --> 02:27:12,840
When you've got what you want,
you will go home.

1252
02:27:13,080 --> 02:27:14,640
No, I shan't, Auda.

1253
02:27:15,400 --> 02:27:16,760
Then you are a fool.

1254
02:27:17,400 --> 02:27:20,280
Maybe. But I am not a deserter.

1255
02:27:21,320 --> 02:27:23,440
Give thanks to God, Brighton...

1256
02:27:23,680 --> 02:27:26,640
...that when He made you a fool,
He gave you a fool's face.

1257
02:27:27,840 --> 02:27:29,840
You are an impudent rascal.

1258
02:27:31,320 --> 02:27:35,440
I must go, Lawrence, before I
soil myself with a fool's blood.

1259
02:27:45,440 --> 02:27:47,080
Like talking to a brick wall.

1260
02:27:55,400 --> 02:27:57,960
So what will you do now?
What can you do?

1261
02:27:58,600 --> 02:28:00,240
I'll go north.

1262
02:28:01,520 --> 02:28:03,280
That's what Allenby wants.

1263
02:28:03,520 --> 02:28:07,440
Allenby wanted the Arab army
behind Deraa.

1264
02:28:07,680 --> 02:28:09,840
Then that's where I'll take it.

1265
02:28:10,800 --> 02:28:15,480
Tell Allenby to hurry up, or we'll be
in Deraa before he's in Jerusalem.

1266
02:28:15,720 --> 02:28:16,840
Won't we?

1267
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:49,000
Train, Farraj.

1268
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:51,440
Yeah, Lawrence.

1269
02:29:19,480 --> 02:29:21,240
Hide yourself, my friend.

1270
02:29:30,080 --> 02:29:31,440
Detonator.

1271
02:29:44,400 --> 02:29:46,040
All right, fetch another.

1272
02:29:46,240 --> 02:29:49,840
- Pardon, Lawrence. I put...
- Plenty of time. Fetch another.

1273
02:29:55,080 --> 02:29:56,440
Farraj?

1274
02:30:06,280 --> 02:30:09,240
- What happened?
- Detonator. A detonator!

1275
02:30:22,200 --> 02:30:24,560
He cannot ride, Lawrence. Look.

1276
02:30:33,680 --> 02:30:36,440
If they take him alive,
you know what they'll do to him.

1277
02:30:48,320 --> 02:30:50,640
Daud will be angry with you.

1278
02:30:51,640 --> 02:30:53,440
Salute him for me.

1279
02:31:12,400 --> 02:31:14,040
What will you do now?

1280
02:31:15,400 --> 02:31:16,840
Go north.

1281
02:31:17,080 --> 02:31:18,440
With twenty?

1282
02:31:19,280 --> 02:31:21,640
What would
you recommend me to do?

1283
02:31:23,320 --> 02:31:25,240
What would you recommend?

1284
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:32,240
He hasn't 1 l10 so many men, sir.

1285
02:31:32,440 --> 02:31:34,240
He's lied, in fact.

1286
02:31:35,520 --> 02:31:39,080
Yes and no. He doesn't claim to have
done anything he hasn't done.

1287
02:31:39,320 --> 02:31:41,840
Then there is an Arab north army.

1288
02:31:43,320 --> 02:31:47,640
- No, sir, he has lied about that.
- Any idea why?

1289
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:51,840
- It's his army, I suppose.
- It's Prince Feisal's army.

1290
02:31:53,200 --> 02:31:55,640
Do you think he's gone native, Harry?

1291
02:31:56,920 --> 02:31:58,440
No.

1292
02:31:59,440 --> 02:32:03,000
He would if he could, I think.

1293
02:32:04,720 --> 02:32:08,040
- Not my line of country.
- It doesn't matter. Just curious.

1294
02:32:08,720 --> 02:32:10,840
What matters is I believed it.

1295
02:32:11,120 --> 02:32:12,760
The Turks believe it.

1296
02:32:13,000 --> 02:32:16,240
They are offering 20,000 pounds
for him.

1297
02:32:18,120 --> 02:32:19,800
Good heavens.

1298
02:32:20,280 --> 02:32:23,800
- Shouldn't say he had long to live.
- Whatever else, he's a brave man...

1299
02:32:24,040 --> 02:32:28,240
Surely, surely. If he's still going north
with 50 men, he doesn't lack guts.

1300
02:32:29,400 --> 02:32:32,040
I wonder if they'd offer that much
for me.

1301
02:32:33,680 --> 02:32:37,640
What about next year?
Will they still come back?

1302
02:32:37,880 --> 02:32:39,760
I wouldn't be surprised.

1303
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:43,480
- They think he's a kind of prophet.
- They do or he does?

1304
02:32:58,440 --> 02:33:00,920
- Now may I speak?
- Yes.

1305
02:33:01,520 --> 02:33:04,560
One more failure and you will find
yourself alone.

1306
02:33:05,920 --> 02:33:09,240
- I do not include myself.
- I do not include the others.

1307
02:33:09,520 --> 02:33:11,640
So say they love you.

1308
02:33:12,040 --> 02:33:14,440
The more reason to be thrifty
with them.

1309
02:33:14,640 --> 02:33:17,640
Give them something to do
that can be done. But you, no.

1310
02:33:17,840 --> 02:33:19,920
They must move mountains,
walk on water.

1311
02:33:20,160 --> 02:33:23,240
That's right. That's right.

1312
02:33:23,840 --> 02:33:26,200
Who are you to know
what can be done?

1313
02:33:26,680 --> 02:33:30,160
If we'd done what you thought could
be done, we'd be in Yenbo now.

1314
02:33:30,720 --> 02:33:35,000
Whatever I ask them to do can
be done. They know that if you don't.

1315
02:33:37,000 --> 02:33:39,840
Do you think I'm just anybody?

1316
02:33:40,320 --> 02:33:41,640
Do you?

1317
02:33:44,720 --> 02:33:47,920
My friends, who will walk on water
with me?

1318
02:33:51,240 --> 02:33:55,440
- Who will come with me into Deraa?
- Deraa is garrisoned.

1319
02:33:55,640 --> 02:33:57,640
Will you take 20 against 2000?

1320
02:33:57,880 --> 02:34:01,440
- I'll go by myself if I have to.
- Why?

1321
02:34:01,680 --> 02:34:03,480
Because I told the English generals...

1322
02:34:03,720 --> 02:34:07,200
...the Arab revolt would be in Deraa
when they'd be in Jerusalem.

1323
02:34:07,640 --> 02:34:09,640
Or perhaps you are here...

1324
02:34:10,240 --> 02:34:12,120
...for the English generals.

1325
02:34:14,080 --> 02:34:15,640
Who says this?

1326
02:34:15,920 --> 02:34:17,240
Rumour.

1327
02:34:18,480 --> 02:34:20,880
That is not an argument.

1328
02:34:21,120 --> 02:34:23,240
Oh, argument.

1329
02:34:23,440 --> 02:34:26,680
This afternoon I will take
the Arab revolt into Deraa...

1330
02:34:26,920 --> 02:34:29,240
...while the Arabs argue.

1331
02:34:31,080 --> 02:34:34,080
Can you pass for an Arab
in an Arab town?

1332
02:34:34,440 --> 02:34:38,040
Yes. If one of you would lend me
some dirty clothes.

1333
02:34:46,920 --> 02:34:48,120
It's madness.

1334
02:34:51,440 --> 02:34:53,160
What are you looking for?

1335
02:34:53,400 --> 02:34:55,760
Some way to announce myself.

1336
02:34:56,000 --> 02:34:57,840
Be patient with him, God.

1337
02:35:10,720 --> 02:35:14,800
- Do you not see how they look at you?
- Peace, Ali, I am invisible.

1338
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:16,240
Halt!

1339
02:35:16,480 --> 02:35:17,640
Walk on.

1340
02:35:17,840 --> 02:35:19,640
- Halt!
- Walk on.

1341
02:35:20,720 --> 02:35:22,840
You and you.

1342
02:36:44,480 --> 02:36:45,480
You.

1343
02:37:01,360 --> 02:37:03,280
You have blue eyes.

1344
02:37:04,160 --> 02:37:08,200
- I say you have blue eyes.
- Yes, effendi.

1345
02:37:08,440 --> 02:37:11,560
- Are you Circassian?
- Yes, effendi.

1346
02:37:12,440 --> 02:37:13,920
How old are you?

1347
02:37:14,160 --> 02:37:17,040
Twenty-seven, effendi.

1348
02:37:17,280 --> 02:37:19,080
I think.

1349
02:37:19,320 --> 02:37:23,640
You look older.
You have had a lot of experience.

1350
02:37:24,880 --> 02:37:26,880
It's an interesting face.

1351
02:37:31,320 --> 02:37:33,680
I am surrounded by cattle.

1352
02:37:34,320 --> 02:37:37,840
He wouldn't know an interesting face
from a sow's belly.

1353
02:37:38,800 --> 02:37:42,640
I have been is Deraa now
for three and a half years.

1354
02:37:42,840 --> 02:37:47,080
If they posted me to the dark side
of the moon, I could not be more...

1355
02:37:47,240 --> 02:37:49,040
...isolated.

1356
02:37:50,880 --> 02:37:53,360
You haven't the least idea
what I'm talking about.

1357
02:37:53,640 --> 02:37:55,240
No, effendi.

1358
02:37:57,720 --> 02:37:59,040
Have you?

1359
02:38:00,240 --> 02:38:01,440
No.

1360
02:38:02,120 --> 02:38:03,880
That would be too...

1361
02:38:04,120 --> 02:38:05,640
...lucky.

1362
02:38:29,120 --> 02:38:30,800
Where did you get that?

1363
02:38:32,640 --> 02:38:36,640
- It's old, effendi.
- No, this is recent.

1364
02:38:38,640 --> 02:38:40,760
- You are a deserter.
- No, effendi.

1365
02:38:41,000 --> 02:38:42,800
Yes, you are a deserter.

1366
02:38:43,880 --> 02:38:46,040
But from which army?

1367
02:38:48,440 --> 02:38:50,600
Not that it matters at all.

1368
02:38:50,920 --> 02:38:53,160
A man cannot be always in uniform.

1369
02:39:04,160 --> 02:39:06,080
Your skin is very fair.

1370
02:39:24,160 --> 02:39:25,400
Beat him.

1371
02:40:56,040 --> 02:40:57,360
To me!

1372
02:42:55,040 --> 02:42:56,520
Sleep.

1373
02:42:58,080 --> 02:42:59,560
Sleep.

1374
02:43:10,840 --> 02:43:12,160
Eat.

1375
02:43:17,480 --> 02:43:18,680
Eat.

1376
02:43:22,440 --> 02:43:25,160
You have a body, like other men.

1377
02:43:33,560 --> 02:43:34,520
Good.

1378
02:43:35,680 --> 02:43:37,400
Then sleep.

1379
02:43:50,320 --> 02:43:51,520
Better?

1380
02:43:52,080 --> 02:43:54,720
Much better. You were right.

1381
02:43:54,960 --> 02:43:57,040
Rest, rest. Can you not learn?

1382
02:43:57,960 --> 02:43:59,920
Oh, I've learned all right.

1383
02:44:05,480 --> 02:44:07,120
I'm going, Ali.

1384
02:44:08,160 --> 02:44:10,160
- Why?
- Why?

1385
02:44:11,400 --> 02:44:12,640
Heavens.

1386
02:44:12,880 --> 02:44:14,120
Why?

1387
02:44:15,000 --> 02:44:17,120
I've come to the end of myself,
I suppose.

1388
02:44:17,360 --> 02:44:19,320
And the end of the Arab revolt?

1389
02:44:19,560 --> 02:44:22,560
I'm not the Arab revolt, Ali.
I'm not even Arab.

1390
02:44:22,800 --> 02:44:25,720
A man can be whatever he wants.
You said.

1391
02:44:25,960 --> 02:44:28,840
I'm sorry. I thought it was true.

1392
02:44:29,080 --> 02:44:30,920
You proved it.

1393
02:44:31,160 --> 02:44:33,240
Look, Ali. Look.

1394
02:44:33,520 --> 02:44:37,120
That's me. What colour is it?
That's me.

1395
02:44:37,880 --> 02:44:40,080
And there's nothing I can do about it.

1396
02:44:40,280 --> 02:44:42,840
A man can do whatever he wants.
You said.

1397
02:44:44,560 --> 02:44:45,960
He can...

1398
02:44:46,160 --> 02:44:48,920
...but he can't want what he wants.

1399
02:44:49,840 --> 02:44:52,920
This is the stuff that decides what
he wants.

1400
02:44:55,640 --> 02:44:59,280
You may as well know.
I would've told them anything.

1401
02:44:59,480 --> 02:45:03,280
I would've told them who I am.
I would've told them where you were.

1402
02:45:03,480 --> 02:45:06,160
- I tried to.
- So would any man.

1403
02:45:06,360 --> 02:45:09,720
Well, any man is what I am.

1404
02:45:10,680 --> 02:45:14,520
And I'm going back to Allenby to
ask him for a job...

1405
02:45:14,800 --> 02:45:16,720
...that any man can do.

1406
02:45:17,040 --> 02:45:18,840
Allenby's in Jerusalem.

1407
02:45:19,120 --> 02:45:21,720
- I'll make easy stages.
- You?

1408
02:45:23,200 --> 02:45:26,520
Oh, yes. Easy stages.

1409
02:45:28,240 --> 02:45:32,560
Look, Ali, I think I see
a way of being just...

1410
02:45:32,800 --> 02:45:34,360
...ordinarily...

1411
02:45:35,000 --> 02:45:36,360
...happy.

1412
02:45:40,000 --> 02:45:41,560
Can I take this?

1413
02:45:42,160 --> 02:45:44,000
It is not clean.

1414
02:45:44,240 --> 02:45:47,160
No, but it's warm.

1415
02:45:47,520 --> 02:45:48,760
And these...

1416
02:45:48,960 --> 02:45:52,760
...having led them here,
have you no care for them?

1417
02:45:54,200 --> 02:45:59,200
You lead them. They're yours.
Trust your own people.

1418
02:46:01,320 --> 02:46:03,440
And let me go back to mine.

1419
02:46:31,400 --> 02:46:34,360
- I say, don't forget those form fives.
- All right.

1420
02:46:40,000 --> 02:46:41,760
Mind if I join you?

1421
02:46:42,560 --> 02:46:44,160
Honoured, sir.

1422
02:46:46,400 --> 02:46:49,560
- Good to be back.
- We heard you were, sir.

1423
02:46:50,120 --> 02:46:52,560
- What's doing out there?
- Where?

1424
02:46:52,800 --> 02:46:54,960
- Arabia?
- Well, yes, sir.

1425
02:46:55,200 --> 02:46:58,400
Nothing much. Wrong time of year.
What's doing here?

1426
02:46:58,680 --> 02:47:00,960
We're settling in.
We built a squash court.

1427
02:47:01,160 --> 02:47:02,560
Jolly good.

1428
02:47:03,360 --> 02:47:07,160
Well, I have to go up there.

1429
02:47:08,120 --> 02:47:10,520
It's borrowed. Someone pinched mine.

1430
02:47:10,720 --> 02:47:12,400
Bloody wogs.

1431
02:47:13,760 --> 02:47:15,560
Yes, probably.

1432
02:47:16,280 --> 02:47:18,520
Jolly good about the squash court.

1433
02:47:21,160 --> 02:47:23,560
Lays it on a bit thick, doesn't he?

1434
02:47:36,280 --> 02:47:37,480
Morning.

1435
02:47:37,640 --> 02:47:39,360
- Good morning, sir.
- Good to be back.

1436
02:47:39,640 --> 02:47:42,560
- I'll believe you, sir.
- No, really it is.

1437
02:47:45,720 --> 02:47:47,000
Hello.

1438
02:47:47,560 --> 02:47:50,560
Morning. You're to go right in.

1439
02:48:02,120 --> 02:48:03,520
Lawrence.

1440
02:48:05,240 --> 02:48:07,640
Or is it Major Lawrence?

1441
02:48:08,320 --> 02:48:09,640
Sir.

1442
02:48:15,200 --> 02:48:16,960
Well, general, I will leave you.

1443
02:48:17,240 --> 02:48:20,000
Major Lawrence doubtless
has reports to make...

1444
02:48:20,280 --> 02:48:23,920
...about my people
and their weakness...

1445
02:48:24,160 --> 02:48:28,760
...and the need to keep them
in the British interest.

1446
02:48:31,160 --> 02:48:34,520
And the French interest too.
We must not forget the French.

1447
02:48:34,720 --> 02:48:36,680
I told you, sir, no such treaty exists.

1448
02:48:36,960 --> 02:48:41,240
Yes, general, you have lied
most bravely, but not convincingly.

1449
02:48:41,440 --> 02:48:43,360
I know this treaty does exist.

1450
02:48:43,600 --> 02:48:45,440
Treaty, sir?

1451
02:48:47,520 --> 02:48:49,440
He does it better than you, general.

1452
02:48:49,720 --> 02:48:52,840
But then, of course,
he is almost an Arab.

1453
02:49:06,440 --> 02:49:08,000
You really don't know?

1454
02:49:10,240 --> 02:49:12,120
Then what the devil's this?

1455
02:49:13,120 --> 02:49:16,840
It's my request
for release from Arabia, sir.

1456
02:49:17,080 --> 02:49:18,400
For what reason?

1457
02:49:18,560 --> 02:49:20,760
You sure you haven't heard
of the Sykes-Picot Treaty?

1458
02:49:20,960 --> 02:49:22,280
No.

1459
02:49:23,000 --> 02:49:26,040
- I can guess.
- Don't guess. Tell him.

1460
02:49:27,800 --> 02:49:29,120
Well, now...

1461
02:49:29,560 --> 02:49:32,440
Mr. Sykes is an English civil servant.

1462
02:49:32,680 --> 02:49:35,640
Monsieur Picot is
a French civil servant.

1463
02:49:35,840 --> 02:49:39,880
Mr. Sykes and Monsieur Picot met,
and they agreed that after the war...

1464
02:49:40,120 --> 02:49:43,360
...France and England should
share the Turkish Empire.

1465
02:49:43,640 --> 02:49:45,280
Including Arabia.

1466
02:49:45,560 --> 02:49:49,440
They signed an agreement,
not a treaty, sir.

1467
02:49:49,640 --> 02:49:52,640
An agreement to that effect.

1468
02:49:53,240 --> 02:49:56,680
There may be honour among thieves,
but there's none in politicians.

1469
02:49:56,920 --> 02:49:59,560
And let's have
no displays of indignation.

1470
02:49:59,800 --> 02:50:02,800
You may not have known,
but you certainly had suspicions.

1471
02:50:03,320 --> 02:50:06,520
If we've told lies,
you've told half-lies.

1472
02:50:06,680 --> 02:50:10,960
And a man who tells lies, like me,
merely hides the truth.

1473
02:50:11,200 --> 02:50:15,760
But a man who tells half-lies
has forgotten where he put it.

1474
02:50:16,280 --> 02:50:19,440
The truth is I'm an ordinary man.

1475
02:50:19,960 --> 02:50:22,240
You might have told me that, Dryden.

1476
02:50:23,640 --> 02:50:25,560
And I want an ordinary job, sir.

1477
02:50:25,840 --> 02:50:28,040
That's my reason for resigning.

1478
02:50:29,280 --> 02:50:30,840
It's personal.

1479
02:50:31,040 --> 02:50:33,160
- Personal?
- Yes, sir.

1480
02:50:33,400 --> 02:50:36,400
Personal?
You're a serving officer in the field.

1481
02:50:36,600 --> 02:50:39,840
And as it happens, a damned
important one. Are you mad?

1482
02:50:40,080 --> 02:50:43,160
No, and if you don't mind,
I'd rather not go mad.

1483
02:50:43,400 --> 02:50:45,360
That's my reason too.

1484
02:50:45,520 --> 02:50:50,360
Look, I'm making my big push
on Damascus the 16th of next month...

1485
02:50:50,560 --> 02:50:52,440
...and you are part of it.

1486
02:50:52,920 --> 02:50:56,440
Can you understand that? You're
an important part of the big push!

1487
02:50:56,680 --> 02:51:00,400
I don't want to be part
of your big push!

1488
02:51:01,120 --> 02:51:03,080
What about your Arab friends?

1489
02:51:03,280 --> 02:51:06,960
I have no Arab friends!
I don't want Arab friends!

1490
02:51:07,160 --> 02:51:09,280
What in hell do you want, Lawrence?

1491
02:51:09,520 --> 02:51:14,400
I've told you, I just want
my ration of common humanity.

1492
02:51:14,640 --> 02:51:17,440
- Lawrence.
- Yes?

1493
02:51:20,080 --> 02:51:22,680
Nothing. Sorry I interrupted, sir.

1494
02:51:22,960 --> 02:51:24,960
That's all right.
Thank you, Mr. Dryden.

1495
02:51:25,200 --> 02:51:26,840
Thank you, sir.

1496
02:51:27,880 --> 02:51:30,000
Why don't we?

1497
02:51:32,480 --> 02:51:34,240
There's blood on your back.

1498
02:51:35,440 --> 02:51:38,440
- Do you want a doctor?
- No.

1499
02:51:39,560 --> 02:51:41,640
Tell me what happened.

1500
02:51:46,400 --> 02:51:48,440
Say, what goes on in there?

1501
02:51:49,200 --> 02:51:51,040
- Nothing.
- Oh, come on!

1502
02:51:51,280 --> 02:51:54,560
- No, really. Nothing at all.
- Is the man in trouble?

1503
02:51:54,760 --> 02:51:58,560
I expect so. We all have troubles.
Life's a vale of troubles.

1504
02:51:58,800 --> 02:52:02,520
Let me know if the man's in trouble.
I've got a claim in that man.

1505
02:52:02,760 --> 02:52:06,040
- What claim?
- I've made that boy a hero.

1506
02:52:06,280 --> 02:52:08,880
When the war's over,
he can be anything he wants.

1507
02:52:09,120 --> 02:52:13,240
Yes. Well, at the moment
he wants to be somebody else.

1508
02:52:13,720 --> 02:52:16,440
Will you kindly allow me to pass?

1509
02:52:17,000 --> 02:52:19,360
Walk away, Dryden, walk away.

1510
02:52:19,600 --> 02:52:22,280
Always walking away, aren't you?

1511
02:52:22,520 --> 02:52:24,000
Well, I'll tell you.

1512
02:52:24,200 --> 02:52:27,040
It's a clash of temperament
that's going on in there.

1513
02:52:27,240 --> 02:52:30,040
Inevitably, one of them's half-mad...

1514
02:52:30,280 --> 02:52:32,920
...and the other, wholly unscrupulous.

1515
02:52:33,720 --> 02:52:36,640
I believe your name will
be a household word...

1516
02:52:37,120 --> 02:52:40,640
...when you'd have to go to the
war museum to find who Allenby was.

1517
02:52:41,480 --> 02:52:44,240
You're the most extraordinary man
I ever met.

1518
02:52:44,840 --> 02:52:46,240
Leave me alone.

1519
02:52:46,520 --> 02:52:48,920
- Leave me alone.
- That's a feeble thing to say.

1520
02:52:49,160 --> 02:52:51,640
- I know I'm not ordinary.
- That's not what I'm saying.

1521
02:52:51,880 --> 02:52:54,520
All right, I'm extraordinary.

1522
02:52:56,440 --> 02:52:57,480
What of it?

1523
02:52:57,840 --> 02:53:00,440
Not many people have
a destiny, Lawrence.

1524
02:53:00,640 --> 02:53:03,640
It's a terrible thing
for a man to flunk it if he has.

1525
02:53:03,840 --> 02:53:05,880
Are you speaking from experience?

1526
02:53:06,160 --> 02:53:07,480
No.

1527
02:53:07,640 --> 02:53:09,440
You're guessing, then.

1528
02:53:10,520 --> 02:53:11,840
Suppose you're wrong.

1529
02:53:12,080 --> 02:53:15,000
Why suppose that?
We both know I'm right.

1530
02:53:15,800 --> 02:53:18,640
- Yes. I said, yes.
- After all...

1531
02:53:21,120 --> 02:53:23,040
- The 16th?
- Can you do it?

1532
02:53:23,200 --> 02:53:25,240
I'll give you a lot of money.

1533
02:53:25,520 --> 02:53:28,240
- Artillery?
- I can't.

1534
02:53:29,400 --> 02:53:32,240
They won't be coming for money,
not the best of them.

1535
02:53:32,520 --> 02:53:34,640
They'll be coming for Damascus.

1536
02:53:35,680 --> 02:53:37,600
Which I'm going to give them.

1537
02:53:38,320 --> 02:53:40,000
That's all I want.

1538
02:53:41,040 --> 02:53:43,840
All you want is someone
holding down the Turkish Right.

1539
02:53:44,040 --> 02:53:48,120
But I'm going to give them Damascus.
We'll get there before you do.

1540
02:53:48,400 --> 02:53:51,440
And when we've got it, we'll keep it.

1541
02:53:51,680 --> 02:53:53,920
Tell the politicians
to burn their paper now.

1542
02:53:54,160 --> 02:53:55,440
Fair enough.

1543
02:53:55,920 --> 02:53:58,720
Fair? What's fair got to do with it?

1544
02:53:59,400 --> 02:54:01,240
It's going to happen.

1545
02:54:01,920 --> 02:54:03,920
I shall want quite a lot of money.

1546
02:54:04,600 --> 02:54:06,200
All there is.

1547
02:54:06,720 --> 02:54:08,240
Not that much.

1548
02:54:11,400 --> 02:54:14,040
The best of them
won't come for money.

1549
02:54:15,840 --> 02:54:17,200
They'll come for me.

1550
02:54:34,920 --> 02:54:36,120
No pictures!

1551
02:54:36,400 --> 02:54:38,640
It's not for you, it's for Major Lawrence.

1552
02:54:38,840 --> 02:54:42,840
He doesn't mind having his picture
taken. He doesn't mind at all.

1553
02:54:43,080 --> 02:54:45,240
Well, there's only one Lawrence.

1554
02:54:49,520 --> 02:54:52,000
Have you met Major Lawrence
since he's come back?

1555
02:54:52,280 --> 02:54:53,520
Yes.

1556
02:54:53,680 --> 02:54:55,960
- Changed, hasn't he?
- No.

1557
02:54:56,120 --> 02:54:58,920
Oh, I'd say he had.
Different man, I'd say.

1558
02:55:03,480 --> 02:55:07,000
What did that Turkish general
do to him in Deraa?

1559
02:55:07,680 --> 02:55:12,240
He was the same man after Deraa.
The same man, humbled.

1560
02:55:13,880 --> 02:55:16,320
What did the English general
do to him in Jerusalem?

1561
02:55:16,600 --> 02:55:18,200
Search me. Ask Lawrence.

1562
02:55:18,400 --> 02:55:20,280
- I did.
- What did he say?

1563
02:55:20,520 --> 02:55:22,000
He laughed.

1564
02:55:22,520 --> 02:55:25,040
He told me to gather the Harith here.

1565
02:55:25,560 --> 02:55:27,040
He offered me money.

1566
02:55:27,320 --> 02:55:28,800
Did you take it?

1567
02:55:29,560 --> 02:55:32,080
No. But many did.

1568
02:56:08,240 --> 02:56:11,200
- What is this?
- This is my bodyguard.

1569
02:56:11,880 --> 02:56:14,400
There is not a man
without a price on his head.

1570
02:56:14,640 --> 02:56:18,120
- There's a price on my head too.
- But these are murderers.

1571
02:56:18,360 --> 02:56:20,240
The sheiks will hang these men.

1572
02:56:20,520 --> 02:56:22,200
These men are mine.

1573
02:56:22,680 --> 02:56:26,840
Lawrence, these things know
nothing of the Arab revolt.

1574
02:56:27,160 --> 02:56:30,480
- You, Ghitan of Aleppo.
- Sherif?

1575
02:56:30,680 --> 02:56:33,520
- Where do we ride?
- Damascus, sherif.

1576
02:56:33,760 --> 02:56:35,600
Aye, but for what?

1577
02:56:35,760 --> 02:56:37,880
Sherif, for Lawrence.

1578
02:56:40,880 --> 02:56:44,040
- You have bought these things.
- I bought half the men here, Ali.

1579
02:56:44,280 --> 02:56:46,920
That is different.
These are not ordinary men.

1580
02:56:47,160 --> 02:56:50,000
I don't want ordinary men. Hut!

1581
02:56:53,840 --> 02:56:55,600
Damascus!

1582
02:56:55,840 --> 02:56:57,840
Damascus! Damascus!

1583
02:56:58,080 --> 02:57:01,000
Damascus! Damascus!

1584
02:57:33,480 --> 02:57:36,920
Very well, gentlemen. The cavalry's
gone through Mazril and Deraa.

1585
02:57:37,160 --> 02:57:40,640
Very good, by the way.
Very good indeed. Now your turn.

1586
02:57:40,840 --> 02:57:44,360
If the enemy's retreating in
any order, which we'll assume...

1587
02:57:44,520 --> 02:57:45,520
Certainly.

1588
02:57:45,680 --> 02:57:47,360
He can't be far from Mallud...

1589
02:57:48,000 --> 02:57:52,120
...in which case I can have him
within range by 0900 hours tomorrow.

1590
02:57:52,360 --> 02:57:54,280
Splendid. Philip.

1591
02:57:54,680 --> 02:57:57,240
These are the last infantry supports
going up now.

1592
02:57:57,480 --> 02:58:00,880
But Mallud, we could have
the fusiliers there by Wednesday.

1593
02:58:01,560 --> 02:58:04,840
That'll do for now.
The guns are what matter.

1594
02:58:05,000 --> 02:58:06,240
Any questions?

1595
02:58:06,680 --> 02:58:10,600
This Arab army on the right, sir,
what's it consist of?

1596
02:58:11,080 --> 02:58:13,200
Irregular cavalry, sir. About 2000.

1597
02:58:13,400 --> 02:58:15,200
Where are they now?

1598
02:58:15,880 --> 02:58:20,600
- Can only know by being with them.
- Then get with them. I want to know.

1599
02:58:20,880 --> 02:58:23,080
Pound them, Charley.

1600
02:58:23,680 --> 02:58:25,000
Pound them.

1601
02:58:35,160 --> 02:58:37,840
God help the men who lie under that.

1602
02:58:38,080 --> 02:58:39,640
They're Turks.

1603
02:58:39,840 --> 02:58:41,440
God help them.

1604
02:59:22,440 --> 02:59:26,000
Well, he's got the bit
between his teeth all right.

1605
02:59:26,280 --> 02:59:27,520
Cocky?

1606
02:59:27,720 --> 02:59:29,400
More than cocky, sir.

1607
02:59:29,680 --> 02:59:32,840
He's got the bit
between his teeth all right.

1608
02:59:33,080 --> 02:59:36,400
I tell you, sir, I think
he'll get to Damascus before we do.

1609
02:59:37,040 --> 02:59:38,800
- Unless...
- Unless?

1610
02:59:39,000 --> 02:59:42,720
Well, there's a Turkish column
in front of him, out of Mazril.

1611
02:59:42,960 --> 02:59:45,840
- What do the Turks have in Mazril?
- A brigade, sir.

1612
02:59:48,720 --> 02:59:50,800
I wonder where they are now.

1613
03:01:28,720 --> 03:01:29,840
No prisoners.

1614
03:01:33,200 --> 03:01:35,200
Damascus, Lawrence.

1615
03:01:44,720 --> 03:01:47,440
Lawrence, not this.

1616
03:01:48,120 --> 03:01:51,960
Go round.
Damascus, Lawrence, Damascus.

1617
03:01:52,680 --> 03:01:54,200
No prisoners.

1618
03:02:03,920 --> 03:02:05,440
This was Talaal's village.

1619
03:02:09,520 --> 03:02:11,440
Talaal!

1620
03:02:21,040 --> 03:02:22,200
Talaal!

1621
03:02:30,880 --> 03:02:32,800
No prisoners!

1622
03:02:33,280 --> 03:02:34,320
No prisoners!

1623
03:02:45,720 --> 03:02:46,960
God.

1624
03:02:50,560 --> 03:02:51,840
God.

1625
03:02:53,680 --> 03:02:55,040
God!

1626
03:05:06,680 --> 03:05:09,720
Enough.
Enough! Make them stop!

1627
03:06:43,120 --> 03:06:44,320
Major!

1628
03:06:44,920 --> 03:06:46,520
Major Lawrence!

1629
03:06:51,960 --> 03:06:53,520
Jesus wept.

1630
03:07:08,480 --> 03:07:09,680
Jesus wept.

1631
03:07:11,520 --> 03:07:13,480
Does it surprise you, Mr. Bentley?

1632
03:07:14,080 --> 03:07:16,720
Surely you know
the Arabs are a barbarous people.

1633
03:07:16,960 --> 03:07:18,720
Barbarous and cruel.

1634
03:07:19,480 --> 03:07:21,320
Who but they?

1635
03:07:21,720 --> 03:07:23,000
Who but they?

1636
03:07:25,240 --> 03:07:27,520
Oh, you rotten man.

1637
03:07:28,520 --> 03:07:32,760
Here, let me take
your rotten bloody picture.

1638
03:07:34,760 --> 03:07:36,760
For the rotten bloody newspapers.

1639
03:08:02,200 --> 03:08:05,520
These were cut last night,
Lawrence, in Damascus.

1640
03:08:05,960 --> 03:08:07,600
Damascus!

1641
03:08:07,800 --> 03:08:09,560
Take them to Sherif Ali.

1642
03:08:09,800 --> 03:08:11,160
Tell him.

1643
03:08:12,120 --> 03:08:13,720
Remind him.

1644
03:08:14,560 --> 03:08:17,560
- Is Allenby in Damascus?
- Near.

1645
03:08:18,360 --> 03:08:20,560
Tell Sherif Ali that.

1646
03:08:21,760 --> 03:08:23,520
They are not ripe.

1647
03:08:29,240 --> 03:08:31,160
General salute!

1648
03:08:31,360 --> 03:08:33,560
Present arms!

1649
03:08:47,320 --> 03:08:49,120
Port arms!

1650
03:08:51,800 --> 03:08:53,600
Lawrence is behind it, sir.

1651
03:08:53,800 --> 03:08:56,560
The whole town is plastered
with the Arab flag.

1652
03:09:02,600 --> 03:09:04,320
- When?
- A day and a night, sir.

1653
03:09:04,520 --> 03:09:06,360
They've been here a day and a night.

1654
03:09:06,560 --> 03:09:08,960
They've occupied the town.
They've done it.

1655
03:09:09,240 --> 03:09:12,960
He's set up his own headquarters
in the town hall.

1656
03:09:13,840 --> 03:09:15,560
What else beside the town hall?

1657
03:09:15,840 --> 03:09:18,560
Telephone exchange,
post office, powerhouse...

1658
03:09:18,840 --> 03:09:21,120
...hospitals, fire station.
Everything, sir.

1659
03:09:21,320 --> 03:09:24,160
They call themselves
the Arab National Council...

1660
03:09:24,320 --> 03:09:25,920
...and they're in the town hall.

1661
03:09:26,200 --> 03:09:28,960
Well, they're your pigeon, Harry.

1662
03:09:30,600 --> 03:09:32,000
What should we do about it?

1663
03:09:32,200 --> 03:09:34,520
Get them out of it, sir, quick time.

1664
03:09:35,360 --> 03:09:37,120
How about that, Dryden?

1665
03:09:38,840 --> 03:09:41,440
Not unless you want
a full-scale rising.

1666
03:09:42,200 --> 03:09:45,080
- What, then?
- When will Feisal be in Damascus?

1667
03:09:45,320 --> 03:09:47,240
By special train in two days' time.

1668
03:09:47,520 --> 03:09:48,760
Two days.

1669
03:09:48,920 --> 03:09:52,160
Two days is what you asked for.
I can't keep him out any longer.

1670
03:09:52,440 --> 03:09:54,400
- Isn't it enough?
- Yes.

1671
03:09:54,600 --> 03:09:57,880
- Ample, I should think.
- We can't just do nothing.

1672
03:09:58,120 --> 03:10:01,600
Why not? It's usually best.
Get us something to drink, Tracey.

1673
03:10:01,840 --> 03:10:05,920
And Tracey, all troops to remain
quartered until further orders.

1674
03:10:06,280 --> 03:10:07,840
Does that apply to technical units?

1675
03:10:08,120 --> 03:10:10,120
Technical units particularly.

1676
03:10:10,400 --> 03:10:11,680
Yes, sir.

1677
03:10:12,200 --> 03:10:13,600
Medicals too, sir?

1678
03:10:13,840 --> 03:10:15,960
I'm afraid so, Harry.

1679
03:10:16,280 --> 03:10:17,920
Medicals too.

1680
03:10:56,640 --> 03:10:58,120
We here...

1681
03:10:58,360 --> 03:11:01,120
...are neither Harith nor Howeitat...

1682
03:11:01,320 --> 03:11:04,360
...nor any other tribe, but Arabs...

1683
03:11:04,640 --> 03:11:07,960
...of the Arab Council,
acting for Prince Feisal.

1684
03:11:08,200 --> 03:11:10,120
He insulted me.

1685
03:11:11,240 --> 03:11:15,160
Sherif Ali said that the telephones
are in the care of the Howeitat...

1686
03:11:15,400 --> 03:11:18,120
...and they have ceased to work.
And this is true.

1687
03:11:18,560 --> 03:11:22,120
They will not work because
they are given no electricity.

1688
03:11:22,360 --> 03:11:25,760
The electricity is
in the care of the Harith.

1689
03:11:28,120 --> 03:11:30,360
If you answer,
there will be bloodshed.

1690
03:11:31,240 --> 03:11:34,560
You speak to me of bloodshed?

1691
03:11:37,200 --> 03:11:40,960
I ask pardon of Auda Abu Tayi.

1692
03:11:41,200 --> 03:11:42,680
Humbly?

1693
03:11:42,840 --> 03:11:44,200
Humbly, Harith?

1694
03:11:44,440 --> 03:11:46,360
Yes, humbly.

1695
03:11:46,720 --> 03:11:48,760
This is a new trick.

1696
03:11:49,720 --> 03:11:51,320
Why is there no electricity?

1697
03:11:52,240 --> 03:11:54,880
I have been to that
electrical house, Lawrence.

1698
03:11:55,120 --> 03:11:57,880
There are three large machines.

1699
03:11:58,120 --> 03:12:00,360
He means generators!

1700
03:12:00,840 --> 03:12:01,960
So.

1701
03:12:02,360 --> 03:12:04,000
One of them is burning.

1702
03:12:04,240 --> 03:12:07,240
They are of an incredible size,
but helpless.

1703
03:12:07,520 --> 03:12:10,160
It is so of all machines.

1704
03:12:10,360 --> 03:12:14,200
Let them burn.
What need of telephones?

1705
03:12:16,760 --> 03:12:19,800
- The need is absolute.
- Then we need English engineers.

1706
03:12:20,040 --> 03:12:23,560
No. Take English engineers
and you take English government.

1707
03:12:23,800 --> 03:12:24,960
Take...

1708
03:12:28,920 --> 03:12:30,120
Fire has broken out.

1709
03:12:30,320 --> 03:12:31,800
- Where?
- The Jinsibi district.

1710
03:12:32,040 --> 03:12:34,800
- It is not a district that matters.
- It will spread!

1711
03:12:35,040 --> 03:12:36,680
Then use the fire brigade!

1712
03:12:36,920 --> 03:12:39,680
We have tried,
but there is no force in the water.

1713
03:12:39,920 --> 03:12:41,320
Then you must carry it.

1714
03:12:41,600 --> 03:12:45,760
- The Ruala do not carry water.
- What else are they good for?

1715
03:12:57,560 --> 03:13:00,960
We will hear petitions this afternoon.

1716
03:13:03,720 --> 03:13:05,360
This afternoon!

1717
03:13:28,120 --> 03:13:31,960
- I'll take this up after the war.
- Surely we should do something, sir.

1718
03:13:32,160 --> 03:13:35,960
- It's an old man's sport.
- Are you an old man, sir?

1719
03:13:36,160 --> 03:13:38,960
All I can say is, sir,
it's a heavy responsibility.

1720
03:13:40,360 --> 03:13:41,600
Sorry, sir.

1721
03:13:43,760 --> 03:13:45,360
Maybe it's the bulb.

1722
03:13:49,880 --> 03:13:50,960
No, sir.

1723
03:13:51,360 --> 03:13:52,960
It's the power.

1724
03:14:07,520 --> 03:14:08,880
They're leaving.

1725
03:14:09,560 --> 03:14:11,160
That's it, then.

1726
03:14:11,680 --> 03:14:13,680
Marvellous-Iooking beggars,
aren't they?

1727
03:14:34,040 --> 03:14:36,800
Leave it, Lawrence. Come with me.

1728
03:14:37,040 --> 03:14:38,960
- Come where?
- Back.

1729
03:14:43,200 --> 03:14:45,360
I know your heart.

1730
03:14:53,440 --> 03:14:55,000
What is it?

1731
03:14:56,000 --> 03:14:57,560
Is it this?

1732
03:15:00,200 --> 03:15:03,160
I tell you, this is nothing.

1733
03:15:15,840 --> 03:15:17,440
Is it the blood?

1734
03:15:18,200 --> 03:15:21,160
The desert has dried up more blood
than you could think of.

1735
03:15:22,640 --> 03:15:26,840
I pray that I may never
see the desert again.

1736
03:15:27,880 --> 03:15:29,120
Hear me, God.

1737
03:15:30,760 --> 03:15:34,400
You will come.
There is only the desert for you.

1738
03:15:50,600 --> 03:15:51,840
What about you?

1739
03:15:52,800 --> 03:15:56,240
No, I shall stay here
and learn politics.

1740
03:15:58,640 --> 03:16:00,000
A very low occupation.

1741
03:16:00,480 --> 03:16:03,360
I had not thought of it
when I met you.

1742
03:16:12,000 --> 03:16:14,760
You have tried very hard
to give us Damascus.

1743
03:16:14,960 --> 03:16:16,800
It's what I came for.

1744
03:16:20,160 --> 03:16:21,360
And then...

1745
03:16:23,680 --> 03:16:25,000
...it would be something.

1746
03:16:25,200 --> 03:16:26,400
Yes.

1747
03:16:27,040 --> 03:16:28,160
Much.

1748
03:16:46,440 --> 03:16:48,800
- He is your friend?
- Take your hand away.

1749
03:16:49,000 --> 03:16:50,240
- You love him.
- I fear him.

1750
03:16:50,440 --> 03:16:52,200
Then why do you weep?

1751
03:16:52,520 --> 03:16:54,560
If I fear him, who love him...

1752
03:16:54,760 --> 03:16:57,600
...how must he fear himself,
who hates himself?

1753
03:16:57,960 --> 03:17:00,960
Take your hand away, Howeitat!

1754
03:17:03,240 --> 03:17:06,440
So you are not yet entirely politician.

1755
03:17:06,600 --> 03:17:07,640
Not yet.

1756
03:17:07,880 --> 03:17:12,040
Well, these are new tricks,
and I am an old dog.

1757
03:17:12,560 --> 03:17:14,400
And Allah be thanked.

1758
03:17:14,880 --> 03:17:16,200
I'll tell thee what...

1759
03:17:16,480 --> 03:17:19,680
...being an Arab will be thornier
than you suppose, Harith.

1760
03:17:40,280 --> 03:17:43,440
In all my years,
I've never seen anything like it.

1761
03:17:43,760 --> 03:17:46,440
It comes within the jurisdiction
of the Arab Council.

1762
03:17:46,640 --> 03:17:50,840
Under the circumstances, I think
I must take over. Immediately.

1763
03:17:51,080 --> 03:17:53,960
Under any circumstances at all,
you must obey your orders.

1764
03:17:54,240 --> 03:17:55,720
No, sir, I will not.

1765
03:17:56,640 --> 03:17:58,160
Control yourself.

1766
03:17:58,640 --> 03:18:01,640
Now, go over to the town hall
and see what they say.

1767
03:18:02,560 --> 03:18:04,760
We did what we could
in the civic hospitals.

1768
03:18:04,960 --> 03:18:07,680
But you forgot
the Turkish Military Hospital.

1769
03:18:08,040 --> 03:18:12,320
It has 600 beds. There are
about 2000 Turkish wounded in it.

1770
03:18:12,960 --> 03:18:17,360
All of whom are the responsibility
of your precious Arab Council.

1771
03:18:23,840 --> 03:18:25,200
What's it like?

1772
03:19:38,920 --> 03:19:40,880
This is outrageous!

1773
03:19:41,960 --> 03:19:43,760
Outrageous!

1774
03:19:46,880 --> 03:19:48,560
Outrageous!

1775
03:19:49,600 --> 03:19:51,720
You filthy little wog!

1776
03:20:01,800 --> 03:20:05,720
My friend Lawrence,
if I may call him that.

1777
03:20:05,960 --> 03:20:08,320
"My friend Lawrence."

1778
03:20:08,560 --> 03:20:12,960
How many men will claim the right
to use that phrase? How proudly.

1779
03:20:13,160 --> 03:20:15,720
He longs for the greenness
of his native land.

1780
03:20:15,960 --> 03:20:20,840
He pines for the Gothic cottages
of Surrey, is it not?

1781
03:20:21,080 --> 03:20:24,560
Already in imagination,
he catches trout...

1782
03:20:24,800 --> 03:20:28,160
...and all the activities
of the English gentleman.

1783
03:20:28,400 --> 03:20:31,720
That's me you're describing, sir,
not Colonel Lawrence.

1784
03:20:32,600 --> 03:20:34,720
You're promoted colonel.

1785
03:20:34,920 --> 03:20:37,280
Yes. What for?

1786
03:20:37,480 --> 03:20:40,560
Take the honour, colonel.
Be a little kind.

1787
03:20:40,760 --> 03:20:44,720
As a colonel, you'll have a cabin
to yourself on the boat home.

1788
03:20:45,280 --> 03:20:47,480
Then, thank you.

1789
03:20:51,520 --> 03:20:52,720
Well, then...

1790
03:20:53,280 --> 03:20:54,280
...Godspeed.

1791
03:20:54,760 --> 03:20:58,520
There's nothing further here
for a warrior.

1792
03:20:58,800 --> 03:21:02,720
We drive bargains. Old men's work.

1793
03:21:02,960 --> 03:21:05,200
Young men make wars,
and the virtues of war...

1794
03:21:05,360 --> 03:21:07,160
...are the virtues of young men.

1795
03:21:07,400 --> 03:21:10,720
Courage and hope for the future.

1796
03:21:10,920 --> 03:21:13,520
Then old men make the peace.

1797
03:21:14,560 --> 03:21:17,360
And the vices of peace
are the vices of old men.

1798
03:21:17,560 --> 03:21:19,920
Mistrust and caution.

1799
03:21:20,800 --> 03:21:22,560
It must be so.

1800
03:21:38,320 --> 03:21:42,720
What I owe you is beyond evaluation.

1801
03:21:52,080 --> 03:21:55,600
The powerhouse, the telephone
exchange, these I concede.

1802
03:21:55,840 --> 03:21:57,520
The pumping plant I must retain.

1803
03:21:57,720 --> 03:22:00,160
If you retain it,
there will be no water.

1804
03:22:00,400 --> 03:22:03,960
- I shall be glad of assistance.
- Then you must bring down your flag.

1805
03:22:04,200 --> 03:22:07,920
I shall not, and if your men
attempt it, my men will resist it.

1806
03:22:08,160 --> 03:22:09,760
- Have you men?
- Enough of that.

1807
03:22:09,960 --> 03:22:12,280
It's a thing that
makes an ugly incident.

1808
03:22:12,600 --> 03:22:14,360
I'm sure your government...

1809
03:22:14,600 --> 03:22:18,320
...does not wish to appear at the peace
conference as an aggressor.

1810
03:22:20,480 --> 03:22:21,920
I say!

1811
03:22:23,280 --> 03:22:25,120
It's Lawrence, isn't it?

1812
03:22:27,360 --> 03:22:29,520
May I shake your hand, sir?

1813
03:22:30,600 --> 03:22:33,120
Just want to be able
to say I'd done it, sir.

1814
03:22:36,600 --> 03:22:38,720
Haven't we met before?

1815
03:22:38,960 --> 03:22:40,480
Don't think so, sir.

1816
03:22:40,680 --> 03:22:43,320
No, no, sir, I should remember that.

1817
03:22:48,320 --> 03:22:52,320
It is widely known the Arab Council
took power in my name.

1818
03:22:52,520 --> 03:22:54,440
They have no power. It's illusory.

1819
03:22:54,720 --> 03:22:57,040
Illusions can be very powerful.

1820
03:22:57,400 --> 03:22:58,920
Particularly...

1821
03:22:59,800 --> 03:23:02,320
...when they take this form.

1822
03:23:04,360 --> 03:23:07,240
The world is delighted
at the picture of Damascus...

1823
03:23:07,480 --> 03:23:09,360
...liberated by the Arab army.

1824
03:23:09,880 --> 03:23:12,800
Led, may I remind you,
by a British-serving officer.

1825
03:23:13,320 --> 03:23:18,160
Ah, yes. But then Lawrence
is a sword with two edges.

1826
03:23:18,400 --> 03:23:21,320
We are equally glad
to be rid of him, are we not?

1827
03:23:24,800 --> 03:23:26,920
I thought I was a hard man, sir.

1828
03:23:27,720 --> 03:23:29,920
You are merely a general.

1829
03:23:32,400 --> 03:23:33,840
I must be a king.

1830
03:23:36,720 --> 03:23:38,520
Excuse me, sir.

1831
03:23:52,560 --> 03:23:53,760
Well?

1832
03:23:54,600 --> 03:23:55,960
Well...

1833
03:23:56,360 --> 03:23:59,160
...it seems we're to have
a British waterworks...

1834
03:23:59,360 --> 03:24:01,520
...with an Arab flag on it.

1835
03:24:01,720 --> 03:24:03,560
Do you think it was worth it?

1836
03:24:03,760 --> 03:24:06,280
Not my business.
Thank God I'm a soldier.

1837
03:24:06,600 --> 03:24:07,760
Yes, sir.

1838
03:24:08,000 --> 03:24:09,560
So you keep saying.

1839
03:24:09,760 --> 03:24:11,320
You, I suspect...

1840
03:24:11,800 --> 03:24:15,520
...are chief architect
of this compromise.

1841
03:24:15,960 --> 03:24:18,920
- What do you think?
- Me, Your Highness?

1842
03:24:19,600 --> 03:24:23,680
On the whole, I wish
I'd stayed in Tunbridge Wells.

1843
03:25:00,200 --> 03:25:03,120
Well, sir. Going home.

1844
03:25:05,360 --> 03:25:06,920
Home, sir.

1845
03:25:13,680 --> 03:25:17,120
Goodbye, Dolly, I must leave you

1846
03:25:17,360 --> 03:25:20,400
Though it breaks my heart to go
