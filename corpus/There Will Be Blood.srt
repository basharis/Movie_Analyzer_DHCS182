1
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:57,654
No!

2
00:05:31,297 --> 00:05:33,561
There she is. There she is.

3
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:44,399
There she is.

4
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:35,063
Ladies and gentlemen,

5
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:39,337
I've traveled over half our state
to be here tonight.

6
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:41,970
I couldn't get away sooner
because my new well was coming in

7
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:44,982
at Coyote Hills
and I had to see about it.

8
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:48,076
That well is now flowing
at 2,000 barrels

9
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:51,383
and it's paying me an income
of $5,000 a week.

10
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:55,356
I have two others drilling
and I have 16 producing at Antelope,

11
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:59,897
so, ladies and gentlemen,
if I say I'm an oilman, you will agree.

12
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:05,397
Now, you have a great chance here,

13
00:15:05,537 --> 00:15:08,404
but bear in mind you could lose it all
if you're not careful.

14
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,906
Out of all men that beg for a chance
to drill your lots,

15
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:14,240
maybe one in twenty will be oilmen.

16
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:15,574
The rest will be speculators,

17
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:18,206
that's men trying to get between
you and the oilmen

18
00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:21,912
to get some of the money that ought,
by rights, come to you.

19
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:24,956
Even if you find one that has money
and means to drill,

20
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,524
he'll maybe know nothing about drilling.

21
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:29,594
He'll have to hire the job out
on contract,

22
00:15:29,728 --> 00:15:32,526
and then you're depending
on a contractor,

23
00:15:32,631 --> 00:15:33,689
who'll rush the job through

24
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:35,892
so he can get another contract
just as quick as he can.

25
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:37,559
This is the way that this works.

26
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:40,935
What is your offer? We're wasting time.

27
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,207
Please!

28
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:47,378
I do my own drilling.

29
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:51,915
And the men that work for me,
work for me, and they are men I know.

30
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:55,748
I make it my business to be there
and to see their work.

31
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:58,948
I don't lose my tools in the hole
and spend months fishing for them.

32
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:00,217
I don't botch the cementing off

33
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:03,887
and let water in the hole
and ruin the whole lease.

34
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:06,020
I'm a family man.

35
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:10,761
I run a family business. This is my son
and my partner, H.W. Plainview.

36
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:16,571
We offer you the bond of family
that very few oilmen can understand.

37
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:21,604
I'm fixed like no other company
in this field

38
00:16:21,747 --> 00:16:24,910
and that's because
my Coyote Hills well has just come in.

39
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:27,484
I have a string of tools
all ready to put to work.

40
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:29,713
I can load a rig onto trucks
and have them here in a week.

41
00:16:29,855 --> 00:16:32,915
I have business connections,
so I can get the lumber for the derricks.

42
00:16:33,058 --> 00:16:36,824
Such things go by friendship
in a rush like this.

43
00:16:36,962 --> 00:16:40,796
And this is why I can guarantee
to start drilling

44
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:43,868
and to put up the cash to back my word.

45
00:16:43,969 --> 00:16:45,527
I assure you, ladies and gentlemen,

46
00:16:45,637 --> 00:16:48,936
no matter what the others
promise to do,

47
00:16:49,074 --> 00:16:52,475
when it comes to the showdown,
they won't be there.

48
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:56,715
Sit down! Sit down, you have no right...

49
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,744
Let us discuss what the man has to say.

50
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:02,844
-Prescott, do you trust this man?
-Let's discuss what he has to say.

51
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:06,413
-There's logic to what he's saying.
-How does he know? My lot is there!

52
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:11,388
Two or three years,
it could be ten years!

53
00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:14,625
-We gain nothing by losing our heads!
-Look at that well out there!

54
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:16,257
Nobody's losing their heads.

55
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:19,796
You have no business being here!

56
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:23,241
Sit that woman down, sir!

57
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:26,275
You can sit down.

58
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:28,880
Mr. Plainview! Please, Mr. Plainview.

59
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:31,973
No, Mr. Plainview!
No, where are you going?

60
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:35,178
-I don't need the lease. Thank you.
-But we need you.

61
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:37,517
Too much confusion.
Thank you for your time.

62
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:39,284
No, no, there's no confusion.

63
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:43,088
I wouldn't take the lease
if you gave it to me as a gift.

64
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:56,536
Mr. Bankside,
I'm not going to waste your time.

65
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:59,110
I'd certainly appreciate it
if you didn't waste mine.

66
00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:03,944
Now, if you wish to sign with me, we
can have a well drilling within 10 days.

67
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:07,450
Your lot is further north
from the discovery well up here.

68
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:10,144
That means
we'll probably have to dig deeper.

69
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:12,655
And if there's as much oil here
as I think there is,

70
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:15,783
it'll be harder to reach, but once
we find it, we can take it right out.

71
00:18:15,894 --> 00:18:20,490
We have to act quickly, because
very soon these fields will be dry.

72
00:18:20,632 --> 00:18:22,930
I need you to know what you want to do.

73
00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:26,061
Now, because of the distance
from the discovery well,

74
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:28,435
I'll pay you a smaller royalty
than you'd get down there

75
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:32,374
but I'm prepared to give you
a $1,000 bonus on your lot.

76
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:34,036
What kind of royalty
are you talking about?

77
00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:38,583
One-sixth, plus a guarantee
to start drilling within 10 days.

78
00:18:38,684 --> 00:18:41,915
Now, that's something
you won't find anywhere else.

79
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:52,797
What age are your children, ma'am?

80
00:18:52,931 --> 00:18:54,626
Ten and twelve.

81
00:18:55,767 --> 00:18:59,635
Mr. Plainview, a question, sir.
Where is your wife?

82
00:19:01,773 --> 00:19:04,606
She died in childbirth, Mrs. Bankside.

83
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:08,009
So it's just me and my son now.

84
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:16,752
It's coming in, boss!

85
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:18,486
Hear it?

86
00:19:44,783 --> 00:19:46,478
Mr. Plainview?

87
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:47,813
Yes?

88
00:19:50,055 --> 00:19:52,148
Are you Daniel Plainview?

89
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:55,185
Yes.

90
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,830
What can I do for you?

91
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:02,463
You look for oil.

92
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,169
That's right.

93
00:20:05,304 --> 00:20:08,330
What do you pay for a place that has it?

94
00:20:08,473 --> 00:20:11,465
-Well, that depends.
-What does it depend on?

95
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:15,343
On a lot of things.

96
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:21,275
If I told you I knew a place that had oil
where land could be bought cheaply,

97
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:24,150
what do you think that would be worth?

98
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:29,389
I think that you should let me know
what you know

99
00:20:29,494 --> 00:20:32,622
and then we'll try
and work something out.

100
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:36,793
-Can I sit down?
-Please.

101
00:20:47,946 --> 00:20:50,244
What church do you belong to?

102
00:20:55,954 --> 00:20:57,251
I...

103
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:02,916
I enjoy all faiths. I don't belong
to one church in particular.

104
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:07,054
I like them all. I like everything.
Where are you from?

105
00:21:07,165 --> 00:21:11,033
That would be telling you.
That's what I want to sell you.

106
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:16,165
What are you doing in Signal Hill?

107
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,675
We have oil,
and it seeps through the ground.

108
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:20,335
Do you want to pay me
to know where it is?

109
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:21,503
Just 'cause there's something
on the ground

110
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:23,376
doesn't mean
there's anything beneath it.

111
00:21:23,482 --> 00:21:26,212
Why did Standard Oil buy up land?

112
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:30,652
Is it in California?

113
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:34,718
-Maybe.
-How much land did they buy?

114
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:38,261
I'd like it better
if you didn't think I was stupid.

115
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:49,037
Why did you come to me?

116
00:21:49,174 --> 00:21:53,474
-You just brought this well in.
-That's right.

117
00:21:53,578 --> 00:21:57,878
Yes, so just give me $500 in cash
right now

118
00:21:58,016 --> 00:22:00,450
and I'll tell you where it is.

119
00:22:00,552 --> 00:22:02,816
I'll tell you what I'll do, son.
I'll give you $100 now,

120
00:22:02,921 --> 00:22:07,551
and if it proves to be a promising lease,
then give you a $1,000 bonus.

121
00:22:07,693 --> 00:22:09,627
Six hundred dollars.

122
00:22:12,464 --> 00:22:15,331
Tell me one thing to help me decide.
What else have you got up there?

123
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:17,129
What do you grow?

124
00:22:17,235 --> 00:22:20,966
We have a big ranch,
but it's mostly rocks.

125
00:22:21,073 --> 00:22:23,541
Plant things.
Nothing will grow but weeds.

126
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:24,869
What makes you think it's up?

127
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:28,070
Is there sulfur around?
Or alkali deposits?

128
00:22:28,213 --> 00:22:31,239
Alkali nearby. I don't know sulfur.

129
00:22:37,823 --> 00:22:39,620
Is that your son?

130
00:22:40,058 --> 00:22:41,355
Yes.

131
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:43,956
-Hi.
-Hi.

132
00:22:47,165 --> 00:22:49,998
-Who are you?
-I'm Fletcher Hamilton.

133
00:22:50,135 --> 00:22:52,103
Nice to meet you, son.
What's your name?

134
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:53,831
What do you do?

135
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,933
I work with Mr. Plainview.

136
00:22:57,642 --> 00:22:59,371
Here's $500, son.

137
00:22:59,511 --> 00:23:03,345
You tell me something worth hearing,
this money's yours.

138
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:11,187
I come from a town called Little Boston
in Isabella County.

139
00:23:13,358 --> 00:23:17,795
This is us, here.
Spur station here at Little Boston.

140
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:20,888
The Sunday ranch
is what you're looking for.

141
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:23,229
There's a sheep trail
that takes you there.

142
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:26,304
It's a mile out of town headed west,
not far.

143
00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:30,340
Just through a small pass here
near the base of the hills.

144
00:23:30,475 --> 00:23:34,172
You'll pass a church
and just follow the sheep trail.

145
00:23:34,312 --> 00:23:38,442
-Where's Standard buying up?
-Here and here.

146
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:43,053
-Your family name is Sunday, yes?
-That's right.

147
00:23:43,155 --> 00:23:44,622
How many's in your family?

148
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:47,953
My father and mother and sisters
and my brother Eli.

149
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:50,755
-How many sisters do you have?
-Two.

150
00:23:50,862 --> 00:23:53,194
-What's your name?
-Paul.

151
00:23:53,298 --> 00:23:56,529
Does any of your family know
about the oil that you say is there?

152
00:23:56,635 --> 00:23:58,068
I don't know.

153
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:00,764
My uncle always said
there was oil there,

154
00:24:00,906 --> 00:24:03,374
but I don't know what they heard
or what they think.

155
00:24:03,475 --> 00:24:04,908
What do you grow?

156
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:10,175
It's goats. It's a goat farm.
I told you, nothing grows but weeds.

157
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:12,773
-ls there water?
-It's salty.

158
00:24:12,918 --> 00:24:16,285
You drill a well,
it's hard not to get saltwater.

159
00:24:18,156 --> 00:24:21,557
The oil is there. I'm telling you.

160
00:24:26,198 --> 00:24:29,395
-I want to go now, so...
-You can stay tonight.

161
00:24:29,534 --> 00:24:33,595
-No, I want to go now. I want to leave.
-Listen, Paul.

162
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:40,241
If I travel all the way out there
and I find that you've been lying to me,

163
00:24:40,378 --> 00:24:42,972
I'm going to find you and I'm going
to take more than my money back.

164
00:24:43,081 --> 00:24:45,311
Is that all right with you?

165
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:47,647
-Yes, sir.
-All right, then.

166
00:24:48,386 --> 00:24:52,516
-Nice luck to you. God bless.
-And to you, young man.

167
00:26:31,957 --> 00:26:33,948
-There's someone coming.
-Thank you, Mary.

168
00:26:43,702 --> 00:26:47,229
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

169
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:53,039
My name's Daniel Plainview.
This is my son, H.W.

170
00:26:53,912 --> 00:26:56,676
-Are you hunting?
-Hunting for quail.

171
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:59,648
We're told there might be a good place
to camp up near the Sunday ranch.

172
00:26:59,751 --> 00:27:01,582
This is the Sunday ranch.
You can camp here.

173
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:04,416
-Thank you. Do you have water?
-Yes.

174
00:27:05,423 --> 00:27:07,414
We heard there was an earthquake
up here a few days ago.

175
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:09,390
-ls that right?
-Yes.

176
00:27:10,261 --> 00:27:13,924
-Your family?
-Yeah, all fine. Thank you.

177
00:27:15,567 --> 00:27:19,003
-We have goat's milk, if you'd like.
-That would be fine.

178
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:22,006
Now,

179
00:27:23,908 --> 00:27:27,969
if we set our tent away over there,
we'd be out of your way over there.

180
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:29,341
That's fine.

181
00:27:29,447 --> 00:27:31,642
Ruth! Help these men
and bring them some water.

182
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:33,183
No! H.W.

183
00:27:35,086 --> 00:27:38,544
Mr. Plainview,
would you like that milk now?

184
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:42,751
-That would be fine. Thank you.
-Mary! Bring them some milk.

185
00:27:42,894 --> 00:27:44,327
My family will help you set up your tent.

186
00:27:44,429 --> 00:27:46,659
No, please.
We set ourselves on this camping trip.

187
00:27:46,765 --> 00:27:48,426
We have to do the camping.

188
00:27:48,566 --> 00:27:49,931
Hurry up!

189
00:27:52,904 --> 00:27:56,897
-Do you have bread?
-We have potatoes.

190
00:27:57,042 --> 00:27:58,669
Potatoes would be nice, thank you.

191
00:27:58,777 --> 00:28:00,244
I'll have them boil you up
some potatoes.

192
00:28:00,378 --> 00:28:02,676
That's all right.
I thought maybe we'd make a fire.

193
00:28:02,781 --> 00:28:05,011
I wanted to work with my son
on making a fire.

194
00:28:05,116 --> 00:28:07,050
All right. My son, Eli, will bring you
some wood.

195
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:09,210
Thank you so much for your hospitality,
Mr. Sunday.

196
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:11,379
-Yes.
-And we'll be out of your way.

197
00:28:11,489 --> 00:28:14,219
-We're just hunting for quail.
-Yes.

198
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:18,355
-I'm sorry we don't have any bread.
-No, no, no.

199
00:28:18,463 --> 00:28:21,261
Corn doesn't fill out in the hills here.
It's mostly rock.

200
00:28:21,399 --> 00:28:24,197
We don't have room to raise the grain.

201
00:28:27,939 --> 00:28:29,998
Thank you, young lady.

202
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:56,860
My name is Eli.

203
00:28:58,203 --> 00:29:00,171
Yes, you're Eli Sunday.

204
00:29:01,172 --> 00:29:02,571
Welcome.

205
00:29:06,277 --> 00:29:07,972
-H.W.
-Eli.

206
00:29:13,284 --> 00:29:16,378
-You're hunting quail?
-That's right.

207
00:29:20,658 --> 00:29:25,152
-We will bring dinner.
-Thank you. Thank you so much.

208
00:30:47,245 --> 00:30:48,439
Dad!

209
00:30:49,147 --> 00:30:50,876
Dad, look at my shoe.

210
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:20,003
That's earthquake oil. Set loose.

211
00:31:43,534 --> 00:31:44,831
So...

212
00:31:46,437 --> 00:31:47,631
So?

213
00:31:48,506 --> 00:31:49,871
So, so.

214
00:31:50,675 --> 00:31:53,974
If there's anything here,
we take it to the sea.

215
00:31:55,113 --> 00:31:58,844
What we do is we build a pipeline
to Port Hueneme or Santa Paula,

216
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:00,474
it's about 100 miles,

217
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:04,487
and we do a deal with Union Oil.
This is what we do.

218
00:32:05,023 --> 00:32:07,992
Then we don't need the railroads
and their shipping costs anymore.

219
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:09,491
You see?

220
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:13,354
Yeah.

221
00:32:13,498 --> 00:32:16,156
-You see that?
-Yeah.

222
00:32:17,235 --> 00:32:19,465
Then we're making money.
We're making the real money.

223
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:21,401
What we should be making.
Not just...

224
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:23,905
Not just throwing it away
on shipping costs.

225
00:32:24,042 --> 00:32:26,169
Otherwise, it's just mud.

226
00:32:30,415 --> 00:32:32,975
How much are we going to pay them?

227
00:32:33,851 --> 00:32:35,341
Who's that?

228
00:32:38,056 --> 00:32:39,853
The Sunday family.

229
00:32:40,425 --> 00:32:43,292
I'm not going to give them oil prices.

230
00:32:45,863 --> 00:32:48,127
I'll give them quail prices.

231
00:32:53,871 --> 00:32:55,498
If we could take a few minutes,

232
00:32:55,606 --> 00:32:58,734
there's something I'd very much
like to talk with you about.

233
00:32:58,876 --> 00:33:02,209
Mother, would you take the girls
outside, please?

234
00:33:14,425 --> 00:33:17,189
I believe in plain speaking, so...

235
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:20,991
This is a beautiful ranch.
I love hunting for quail.

236
00:33:21,866 --> 00:33:24,926
My boy has been sick, you know.
He needs fresh air.

237
00:33:25,036 --> 00:33:28,267
Doctors all say
he needs plentiful fresh air.

238
00:33:30,108 --> 00:33:31,075
So,

239
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:37,637
what would you say would be
a fair price for this lot, Abel?

240
00:33:38,783 --> 00:33:41,343
-To buy this place?
-That's right.

241
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:48,154
Take a moment.

242
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:55,761
-I'm sorry. I don't know.
-Six dollars an acre.

243
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:59,303
Six dollars? Thank you, Eli.

244
00:33:59,437 --> 00:34:03,134
And then with the improvements
to the ranch over the years at $500...

245
00:34:03,274 --> 00:34:05,799
I'd like to offer you $3,700
for this ranch.

246
00:34:05,943 --> 00:34:08,503
-That's $3,700.
-No.

247
00:34:09,447 --> 00:34:11,745
The Lord has sent this man here, Eli.

248
00:34:11,849 --> 00:34:13,339
Yes, I believe He has.

249
00:34:13,484 --> 00:34:17,545
-My offer to you is $3,700.
-What is it that brought you here, sir?

250
00:34:18,756 --> 00:34:20,417
The Good Lord's guidance.

251
00:34:20,525 --> 00:34:21,856
-Now, of course, within that...
-What about our oil?

252
00:34:21,959 --> 00:34:23,620
...we're going to develop a lease.

253
00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:28,421
-What's that?
-What about our oil?

254
00:34:29,834 --> 00:34:31,267
What about it?

255
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:33,564
We have oil here.
That's worth something.

256
00:34:33,671 --> 00:34:36,105
Do you have someone
who can drill for it?

257
00:34:36,207 --> 00:34:38,141
-Do you think there's oil here?
-I know there is.

258
00:34:38,276 --> 00:34:40,301
It's very expensive to drill.

259
00:34:40,445 --> 00:34:42,606
To get it up and out of the ground.
You ever tried that before?

260
00:34:42,713 --> 00:34:44,772
-How much is it?
-Costly.

261
00:34:44,882 --> 00:34:47,942
Well, our oil sits right up
on top of the ground.

262
00:34:48,986 --> 00:34:50,715
I believe that's called seepage.

263
00:34:50,855 --> 00:34:52,345
Doesn't necessarily mean
there's anything underneath.

264
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:54,651
-What would you give us for it?
-I don't know.

265
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:57,694
-Something you don't know.
-That's right.

266
00:35:00,998 --> 00:35:02,966
What would you like, Eli?

267
00:35:04,702 --> 00:35:07,000
Ten thousand dollars.

268
00:35:09,207 --> 00:35:10,674
For what?

269
00:35:12,643 --> 00:35:14,338
For my church.

270
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,778
That's good.

271
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:30,590
That's a good one.

272
00:35:32,263 --> 00:35:33,230
Well...

273
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:38,094
If we decide to drill for oil
and if the well begins to produce,

274
00:35:38,202 --> 00:35:39,897
I'll give your church
a $5,000 signing bonus.

275
00:35:40,004 --> 00:35:40,971
Ten thousand.

276
00:35:41,072 --> 00:35:43,563
Do you want to find someone else
that's going to come here and drill, Eli?

277
00:35:43,674 --> 00:35:46,768
Make the investment and do
all the hard work that goes into it?

278
00:35:46,911 --> 00:35:50,779
I can just as easily hunt for quail
on another ranch as I can here, so...

279
00:35:50,915 --> 00:35:55,545
Though I'll happily be a supporter
of your church for as long as I can.

280
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:57,450
For the bonus only.

281
00:35:59,257 --> 00:36:03,057
Now, as it happens, I do have some
connections in the drilling business

282
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:07,723
who might help get us started.
How do you feel about this, Abel?

283
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:09,732
Yes. What Eli says.

284
00:36:09,867 --> 00:36:13,030
Well, good! Let's draw up
some contracts and let's...

285
00:36:13,137 --> 00:36:15,037
Let's give it a try.

286
00:36:16,407 --> 00:36:19,240
Appreciate your help with this, Eli.

287
00:36:30,555 --> 00:36:32,182
-Good afternoon.
-Good afternoon.

288
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:33,587
-Real estate?
-Yes.

289
00:36:33,724 --> 00:36:35,715
Yes, I'd like to talk to you.

290
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:40,354
I'm looking for some land.
I just bought the Sunday ranch.

291
00:36:40,498 --> 00:36:44,525
And, well, where's the map?

292
00:36:45,102 --> 00:36:47,536
Where are the hills
behind the Sunday ranch?

293
00:36:47,672 --> 00:36:51,335
That's here. It's the Bandy tract.
He has over 600 acres.

294
00:36:51,442 --> 00:36:55,503
Bandy, 600.

295
00:36:55,646 --> 00:37:02,108
-What about this?
-A.C. Maude, Blodget, Redlick, Carr.

296
00:37:03,821 --> 00:37:06,813
-What's it held at?
-Six dollars an acre.

297
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:08,855
Six.

298
00:37:08,993 --> 00:37:10,620
What about this?

299
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:14,323
That's the Belvins,
and that could be got, I'm sure.

300
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:18,930
Can everything around here be got?

301
00:37:19,704 --> 00:37:21,171
Sure.

302
00:37:45,496 --> 00:37:48,954
Paul Sunday turned out
to be a good friend of ours.

303
00:37:49,667 --> 00:37:51,259
That's right.

304
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:57,597
Well, you get here just as soon
as you can. Bring Fred English.

305
00:37:58,976 --> 00:38:00,409
Good enough.

306
00:38:01,078 --> 00:38:02,807
Thank you, porter.

307
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:08,044
-H.W., how are you?
-Fine, and you?

308
00:38:08,152 --> 00:38:10,052
-Pretty good. Where's your dad?
-He's inside.

309
00:38:10,154 --> 00:38:11,553
You fellas are a long way
from Signal Hill.

310
00:38:11,656 --> 00:38:13,624
-Hello, Plainview.
-Hello, Gene.

311
00:38:13,758 --> 00:38:16,249
-Good to see you.
-Charlie.

312
00:38:16,394 --> 00:38:20,922
-On your way somewhere else?
-Passing through. Looking around.

313
00:38:21,065 --> 00:38:23,556
-Funny to see you.
-Funny, isn't it?

314
00:38:23,701 --> 00:38:26,431
You boys are a regular family business.

315
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:28,231
You boys are a little late.

316
00:38:28,372 --> 00:38:32,399
-What did you find?
-I found some interesting prospects.

317
00:38:32,543 --> 00:38:33,771
Did you hear Standard bought up?

318
00:38:33,911 --> 00:38:36,505
-Mostly in the north, so far.
-That's what I hear.

319
00:38:36,614 --> 00:38:40,050
I'm gonna tell you, Gene,
if you're gonna make a play, look east.

320
00:38:40,184 --> 00:38:45,417
I'd rather it be you than someone else.
This mud around here has been taken.

321
00:38:45,556 --> 00:38:49,083
It must be easy when you have such
a cute face to carry around with you.

322
00:38:49,226 --> 00:38:52,286
-Telling me how handsome my son is?
-Well, that I am.

323
00:38:52,396 --> 00:38:55,559
That's very nice. Thank you.
Good luck, Gene.

324
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:58,168
-Take care.
-Like I said, go east.

325
00:38:58,269 --> 00:38:59,361
H.W.

326
00:39:00,404 --> 00:39:03,066
I'll be your lawyer
if you need to draw up a contract.

327
00:39:03,207 --> 00:39:07,473
Make sure you don't get swindled, boy.
Get half what your dad's making.

328
00:39:17,755 --> 00:39:19,347
How's that?

329
00:39:34,305 --> 00:39:36,466
What are those men doing?

330
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:41,334
They're just guys
that are working for us.

331
00:39:41,479 --> 00:39:43,777
They're just looking around.

332
00:39:45,983 --> 00:39:48,213
How much money can we make?

333
00:39:52,256 --> 00:39:54,622
I don't know. It depends.

334
00:39:58,829 --> 00:40:00,922
One thousand dollars?

335
00:40:08,773 --> 00:40:12,539
Mary said that her father beats her
if she doesn't pray.

336
00:40:19,116 --> 00:40:21,550
Mary, she's the smaller one?

337
00:40:24,221 --> 00:40:25,745
Yes, she is.

338
00:40:39,537 --> 00:40:42,062
-Everyone here?
-Very successful.

339
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:43,864
But?

340
00:40:44,008 --> 00:40:47,375
There were a few vacant lots
and one holdout.

341
00:40:47,511 --> 00:40:49,138
-Who?
-William Bandy.

342
00:40:49,246 --> 00:40:51,305
...eight. Who's he?

343
00:40:51,415 --> 00:40:52,814
He's an old man
who homesteaded here.

344
00:40:52,917 --> 00:40:56,045
Lives with his grandson.
He said he'd like to speak with you.

345
00:40:56,187 --> 00:40:57,347
Is he here?

346
00:40:57,488 --> 00:41:00,514
No, he'd like you to come visit with him.

347
00:41:00,658 --> 00:41:02,353
He's boosting his price.

348
00:41:02,493 --> 00:41:06,293
He said he'd like to speak
with whoever is doing the buying.

349
00:41:06,397 --> 00:41:09,662
Well, let him wait. He'll come around.
Let's go.

350
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:18,674
Ladies and gentlemen?

351
00:41:19,677 --> 00:41:21,702
Ladies and gentlemen.

352
00:41:21,846 --> 00:41:25,213
Thank you so much
for visiting with us this evening.

353
00:41:25,349 --> 00:41:28,910
Now, I've traveled across half our state
to be here and to see about this land.

354
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:33,479
Now, I daresay some of you
might have heard

355
00:41:33,624 --> 00:41:37,458
some of the more extravagant rumors
about what my plans are,

356
00:41:37,561 --> 00:41:40,325
so I just thought
you'd like to hear it from me.

357
00:41:40,464 --> 00:41:43,331
This is the face. It's no great mystery.

358
00:41:46,203 --> 00:41:50,162
I'm an oilman, ladies and gentlemen,

359
00:41:51,041 --> 00:41:54,442
I have numerous concerns
spread across this state.

360
00:41:54,545 --> 00:41:57,946
I have many wells flowing
at many thousand barrels per day,

361
00:41:58,048 --> 00:42:01,017
so I like to think of myself as an oilman.

362
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:03,816
As an oilman, I hope that you'll forgive

363
00:42:03,921 --> 00:42:06,822
just good old-fashioned plain speaking.

364
00:42:08,459 --> 00:42:11,986
Now, this work that we do
is very much a family enterprise.

365
00:42:12,129 --> 00:42:14,791
I work side by side
with my wonderful son, H. W.

366
00:42:14,899 --> 00:42:18,130
I think one or two of you
might have met him already.

367
00:42:18,235 --> 00:42:22,001
And I encourage my men
to bring their families, as well.

368
00:42:22,139 --> 00:42:26,098
Of course, it makes for an ever
so much more rewarding life for them.

369
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:30,169
Family means children,
and children means education.

370
00:42:30,314 --> 00:42:33,977
So, wherever we set up camp,
education is a necessity,

371
00:42:34,118 --> 00:42:36,313
and we're just so happy
to take care of that.

372
00:42:36,453 --> 00:42:38,819
So let's build a wonderful school
in Little Boston.

373
00:42:38,956 --> 00:42:41,151
These children are the future
that we strive for,

374
00:42:41,292 --> 00:42:44,386
and so they should have
the very best of things.

375
00:42:44,495 --> 00:42:46,486
Now, something else,

376
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:50,464
and please don't be insulted
if I speak about this. Bread.

377
00:42:50,601 --> 00:42:52,569
Let's talk about bread.

378
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:56,603
Now, to my mind, it's an abomination
to consider

379
00:42:56,740 --> 00:43:00,938
that any man, woman, or child
in this magnificent country of ours

380
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:04,536
should have to look upon
a loaf of bread as a luxury.

381
00:43:05,349 --> 00:43:08,910
We're going to dig water wells here,
and water wells means irrigation.

382
00:43:09,053 --> 00:43:11,419
Irrigation means cultivation.

383
00:43:11,555 --> 00:43:15,423
We're going to raise crops here where
before it just simply wasn't possible.

384
00:43:15,559 --> 00:43:17,959
You're going to have more grain
than you'll know what to do with,

385
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:21,030
and bread will be coming right
out of your ears, ma'am.

386
00:43:21,131 --> 00:43:26,433
New roads, agriculture,
employment, education.

387
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:28,538
These are just a few of the things
we can offer you,

388
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:30,607
and I assure you,
ladies and gentlemen,

389
00:43:30,741 --> 00:43:32,902
that if we do find oil here,

390
00:43:33,043 --> 00:43:36,444
and I think there's a very good chance
that we will,

391
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:41,074
this community of yours
will not only survive, it will flourish.

392
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:46,346
I'd be happy to answer any questions
that you might have. Yes?

393
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:48,982
Will the new road lead to the church?

394
00:43:49,093 --> 00:43:53,530
That'll be the first place that it leads.
Thank you, Eli. Anyone else?

395
00:43:54,198 --> 00:43:56,496
Well, if anything comes up,
I'm pretty easy to find.

396
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:57,862
You just come visit with me.

397
00:43:57,968 --> 00:43:59,993
Thank you so much for your time,
and good night.

398
00:44:38,542 --> 00:44:43,502
What a privilege to carry

399
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:47,515
everything to God in prayer!

400
00:44:48,485 --> 00:44:52,046
What a privilege to carry...

401
00:45:09,406 --> 00:45:11,271
Just follow the new road
right to the church.

402
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:13,605
The new road will lead you there.

403
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:15,372
Hello, brother, my name is Eli.

404
00:45:15,512 --> 00:45:19,039
The Church of the Third Revelation
welcomes you.

405
00:45:19,183 --> 00:45:20,878
Hello, brother, my name is Eli.

406
00:45:21,018 --> 00:45:23,316
The Church of the Third Revelation
welcomes you.

407
00:45:23,454 --> 00:45:26,480
Just follow the new road
right to the church.

408
00:45:35,332 --> 00:45:38,893
Jesus knows our every weakness

409
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:43,673
Take it to the Lord in prayer

410
00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:49,072
Are we weak and heavy-laden

411
00:45:50,114 --> 00:45:53,106
Cumbered with a load of care?

412
00:45:54,351 --> 00:45:57,445
Precious Savior still our refuge

413
00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:02,084
Take it to the Lord in prayer...

414
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:17,164
-Daniel, may I speak with you?
-Yes, come in.

415
00:46:19,309 --> 00:46:22,278
I'll bring them up when they arrive.

416
00:46:22,412 --> 00:46:24,607
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

417
00:46:24,748 --> 00:46:26,648
How is all the work coming?

418
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:28,217
Everything's good.

419
00:46:28,318 --> 00:46:31,446
-All the men are provided for?
-Of course.

420
00:46:33,524 --> 00:46:35,389
Spirits seem high.

421
00:46:37,861 --> 00:46:41,297
Is there anything
that you need from me?

422
00:46:44,401 --> 00:46:48,633
-Anything the church can do for you?
-I don't believe so. No. Thank you.

423
00:46:48,772 --> 00:46:51,104
I understand you've asked the people
to gather around

424
00:46:51,241 --> 00:46:52,833
and watch the well begin tomorrow.
Is that right?

425
00:46:52,943 --> 00:46:54,911
-That's right.
-I will bless the well.

426
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:59,376
Before you begin,
you should introduce me.

427
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:02,043
You'll see me walk up
towards the oil well, and when l...

428
00:47:02,152 --> 00:47:03,210
The derrick.

429
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:07,120
You'll see me walk up,
and then you could say my name.

430
00:47:07,257 --> 00:47:09,384
When you walk up?

431
00:47:09,493 --> 00:47:13,395
Yes. You'll see me walk up,
and then you could say,

432
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:18,628
"The proud son of these hills
who tended his Father's flock,"

433
00:47:18,869 --> 00:47:21,269
and then you could say my name.

434
00:47:22,573 --> 00:47:24,131
That's fine.

435
00:47:25,142 --> 00:47:28,543
-And what happens then?
-Well, then we start the drill.

436
00:47:31,715 --> 00:47:35,344
It's a simple blessing, Daniel,
but an important one.

437
00:47:35,485 --> 00:47:38,454
It's just a few words. It won't take long.

438
00:47:39,556 --> 00:47:42,650
-What time?
-What time's good for you, Eli?

439
00:47:42,793 --> 00:47:45,591
-4:00.
-Well, let's make it 4:00 then.

440
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:50,428
-My thanks for your visit.
-Good day. Thank you.

441
00:48:05,849 --> 00:48:07,817
Afternoon, everyone.

442
00:48:09,152 --> 00:48:10,744
Come with me.

443
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:19,617
I thank you all so much
for visiting with us at this time.

444
00:48:19,763 --> 00:48:21,560
I've had the pleasure of
meeting some of you

445
00:48:21,665 --> 00:48:23,496
and I hope very much
in the months to come,

446
00:48:23,634 --> 00:48:26,797
I'll be able to visit with
each and every one of you.

447
00:48:26,937 --> 00:48:29,599
I'm better at digging holes in the
ground than making speeches,

448
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:31,264
so let's forget the speech
for this evening,

449
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:33,308
just make it a simple blessing.

450
00:48:33,443 --> 00:48:35,206
You see, one man doesn't prospect
from the ground.

451
00:48:35,312 --> 00:48:39,248
It takes a whole community of
good people, such as yourselves,

452
00:48:39,349 --> 00:48:42,341
and this is good. We stay together.

453
00:48:42,452 --> 00:48:44,215
We pray together, we work together,

454
00:48:44,321 --> 00:48:47,290
and if the Good Lord smiles kindly
on our endeavor,

455
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:49,892
we share in the wealth together.

456
00:48:52,329 --> 00:48:54,388
Now, before we spud in
Mary's Well Number One,

457
00:48:54,498 --> 00:48:57,661
named for the lovely
Miss Mary Sunday, here by my side,

458
00:48:57,768 --> 00:49:00,760
a proud daughter of these hills,

459
00:49:00,904 --> 00:49:04,601
I'd just like to say God bless these
honest labors of ours, and, of course,

460
00:49:04,741 --> 00:49:06,766
God bless you all.

461
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:08,002
Amen.

462
00:49:08,111 --> 00:49:09,408
Now go.

463
00:49:14,384 --> 00:49:16,147
Won't be a minute.

464
00:49:19,222 --> 00:49:21,190
Fast as you can, H.W.

465
00:49:24,695 --> 00:49:26,822
Are you ready to do this?

466
00:49:36,673 --> 00:49:39,141
That's it, ladies and gentlemen!

467
00:49:43,046 --> 00:49:47,142
Al Rose has very generously provided
some refreshments for this occasion

468
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:49,980
out of his own pocket. Thank you, Al.

469
00:49:50,721 --> 00:49:55,158
If you'll all just care to help yourselves,
I'll be back in a minute.

470
00:51:08,131 --> 00:51:09,655
Mary.

471
00:51:11,334 --> 00:51:12,961
Mary Sunday.

472
00:51:15,806 --> 00:51:18,536
-Do you like your new dress?
-Yes. Thank you.

473
00:51:18,642 --> 00:51:21,543
You're welcome. I thought you'd like it.

474
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:24,937
-Are you happy I came here?
-Yes.

475
00:51:26,650 --> 00:51:30,347
Your daddy doesn't hit you anymore,
does he? Does he now?

476
00:51:31,221 --> 00:51:33,086
Better not, right?

477
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:35,748
I'll take care of you.

478
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:41,991
No more hitting, right?
No more hitting. Now go.

479
00:51:42,132 --> 00:51:45,158
Go and play some more
and don't come back.

480
00:51:54,311 --> 00:51:55,744
Daniel?

481
00:51:59,416 --> 00:52:03,580
It's okay, H.W. Go back to sleep.
Go on. Go back to sleep.

482
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:07,283
Daniel.

483
00:52:09,693 --> 00:52:10,887
Daniel.

484
00:52:13,830 --> 00:52:15,092
Daniel!

485
00:52:16,666 --> 00:52:17,860
Daniel!

486
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:19,230
What?

487
00:52:21,104 --> 00:52:23,197
Lost a man down the well.

488
00:52:27,744 --> 00:52:29,871
-What man?
-Joe Gundha.

489
00:52:31,882 --> 00:52:33,941
-Did I know him?
-No.

490
00:52:34,451 --> 00:52:35,509
What happened?

491
00:52:43,193 --> 00:52:44,592
Pick it up.

492
00:52:45,262 --> 00:52:46,854
Set the brake.

493
00:52:46,963 --> 00:52:49,261
-Tie it down.
-Tie it on.

494
00:52:53,870 --> 00:52:55,201
Shit!

495
00:52:57,274 --> 00:53:00,072
God damn it. Where's the body?

496
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:03,402
-They're fishing it out now.
-All right.

497
00:53:06,783 --> 00:53:09,411
-Where's the bit?
-It's on the deck.

498
00:53:52,963 --> 00:53:55,796
Clean him up. Put some clothes on him.

499
00:53:56,933 --> 00:53:58,195
And...

500
00:53:59,836 --> 00:54:01,394
Set up a tent.

501
00:54:01,504 --> 00:54:05,463
Anyone goes down into the cellar,
you tell somebody. Yes?

502
00:54:06,109 --> 00:54:07,508
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

503
00:54:11,448 --> 00:54:13,473
Shut down till midday.

504
00:54:44,781 --> 00:54:50,185
And I had a vision.
Yes, last night, I had a vision

505
00:54:50,287 --> 00:54:53,188
and I felt God's breath
move through me.

506
00:54:56,826 --> 00:55:00,922
And it rolled down into my stomach.

507
00:55:02,932 --> 00:55:04,797
It sloshed around.

508
00:55:06,202 --> 00:55:10,070
And my stomach spoke in a whisper,
not a shout,

509
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:17,508
"Touch this woman with your hands
and caress her." Yes.

510
00:55:21,885 --> 00:55:24,046
My dear Mrs. Hunter,

511
00:55:25,221 --> 00:55:27,553
you have arthritis, don't you?

512
00:55:27,691 --> 00:55:29,682
-Yes, I do, Eli.
-Yes.

513
00:55:29,793 --> 00:55:33,388
The devil is in your hands,
and I will suck it out.

514
00:55:34,564 --> 00:55:39,024
Now, I will not cast this ghost out
with a fever

515
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:44,197
for the new spirit inside me has shown
me I have a new way to communicate.

516
00:55:46,676 --> 00:55:48,701
It is a gentle whisper.

517
00:55:55,085 --> 00:55:57,451
Get out of here, ghost.

518
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:02,355
Get out of here, ghost.

519
00:56:04,394 --> 00:56:05,827
Get out.

520
00:56:06,429 --> 00:56:09,330
Get out of here, ghost.

521
00:56:11,701 --> 00:56:14,864
Get out of here, ghost.

522
00:56:15,004 --> 00:56:18,906
-...and enter this woman's body now.
-Get out of here, ghost.

523
00:56:19,008 --> 00:56:23,843
Get out of here. Don't you dare turn
around and come back.

524
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:26,743
For if you do,

525
00:56:26,850 --> 00:56:32,345
all the armies of my boot
will kick you in the teeth

526
00:56:32,489 --> 00:56:35,981
and you will be cast up
and thrown in the dirt

527
00:56:36,126 --> 00:56:38,492
and thrust back to perdition!

528
00:56:38,628 --> 00:56:42,325
And as long as I have teeth,
I will bite you,

529
00:56:42,465 --> 00:56:46,424
and if I have no teeth, I will gum you!

530
00:56:46,536 --> 00:56:50,267
And as long as I have fists,
I will bash you!

531
00:56:50,373 --> 00:56:55,106
Now, get out of here, ghost!
Get out of here, ghost!

532
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:58,271
Get out of here, ghost!

533
00:57:01,451 --> 00:57:03,043
And it left!

534
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:05,811
-Hallelujah!
-Hallelujah!

535
00:57:07,357 --> 00:57:09,791
-Praise the Lord and his holy days!
-Praise God!

536
00:57:09,926 --> 00:57:13,362
-Amen! Thank you.
-Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, God.

537
00:57:14,631 --> 00:57:16,792
My dear Mrs. Hunter.

538
00:57:20,403 --> 00:57:22,132
Dance with me.

539
00:57:29,379 --> 00:57:31,711
-Thanks for coming.
-It was a wonderful sermon.

540
00:57:31,815 --> 00:57:34,215
-Will I see you tomorrow?
-Yes.

541
00:57:39,222 --> 00:57:40,189
Eli.

542
00:57:42,759 --> 00:57:45,557
Had a tragedy at the well last night.

543
00:57:46,796 --> 00:57:48,491
Yes, I heard.

544
00:57:48,598 --> 00:57:50,998
Joe Gundha was a man
of considerable faith.

545
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:55,332
So if you wish to say a few words,
his burial is at noon tomorrow.

546
00:57:55,438 --> 00:57:58,271
Daniel, this accident
could have been avoided.

547
00:57:58,408 --> 00:58:00,501
It is terrible to think of that well

548
00:58:00,610 --> 00:58:02,475
-working away out there...
-These men work in 12-hour shifts.

549
00:58:02,579 --> 00:58:03,568
-...unblessed.
-They need their rest.

550
00:58:03,713 --> 00:58:05,442
If they don't have it,
they start to make stupid mistakes.

551
00:58:05,548 --> 00:58:08,312
I've seen the men drinking. Don't you
think that has something to do with this?

552
00:58:08,418 --> 00:58:09,885
We need these men well-rested
to bring in this well.

553
00:58:10,019 --> 00:58:12,180
They can't get that if they're up here
listening to your gospel,

554
00:58:12,288 --> 00:58:14,415
and then the well can't produce
and blow gold all over the place.

555
00:58:14,557 --> 00:58:16,525
I wish I had more time with Joe Gundha.

556
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:17,853
More could have been done.

557
00:58:17,994 --> 00:58:22,988
Then the well can't produce
and blow gold all over the place.

558
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:31,637
Now, would you see to it
that his personal possessions

559
00:58:31,741 --> 00:58:33,868
find their way
back to his family, please?

560
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:35,477
Thank you.

561
00:58:36,012 --> 00:58:39,140
Heard you were planning
some renovations.

562
00:58:39,249 --> 00:58:42,218
Yes, our congregation
is growing strongly.

563
00:58:42,886 --> 00:58:47,346
-We need more room.
-That was one goddamn hell of a show.

564
00:58:48,491 --> 00:58:51,016
We were happy to have you, Daniel.

565
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:46,370
Gas, gas, gas!

566
01:00:55,451 --> 01:00:58,545
Lights out! Wait here. Wait here.
Lights out!

567
01:01:08,698 --> 01:01:10,495
Put that fire out!

568
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:41,126
Is he hurt? H.W.!
Hand him down to me!

569
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:47,932
-Hand him down!
-Here.

570
01:01:52,075 --> 01:01:54,168
-Got him?
-I've got him!

571
01:02:01,484 --> 01:02:02,849
Oh, God.

572
01:02:18,267 --> 01:02:19,666
Come on.

573
01:02:31,814 --> 01:02:33,372
Open the door.

574
01:02:48,197 --> 01:02:50,927
Let go. There you go. You're safe.
You're safe.

575
01:02:51,901 --> 01:02:55,735
You're safe now. I got you here.
You're safe. Let go, son.

576
01:02:57,106 --> 01:02:59,973
Tell me where it hurts.
Tell me where it hurts. Tell me where...

577
01:03:00,109 --> 01:03:01,576
-Did you see this?
-No.

578
01:03:01,677 --> 01:03:02,735
Tell me where it hurts.

579
01:03:02,845 --> 01:03:05,405
Where does it hurt you?
Where does it hurt you?

580
01:03:05,515 --> 01:03:09,178
-I can't hear my voice.
-Were you hit in the head?

581
01:03:09,886 --> 01:03:14,414
Were you hit in the head? Tell me!
You have to tell me if you were!

582
01:03:14,524 --> 01:03:16,549
I can't hear my voice.

583
01:03:25,535 --> 01:03:28,265
I have to go and deal with this now.
You wait here for me.

584
01:03:28,371 --> 01:03:32,205
You understand? You wait here for me.
I'll be back. I'll be back in a minute.

585
01:03:32,308 --> 01:03:33,468
-Wait here.
-Don't leave!

586
01:03:33,609 --> 01:03:38,046
I'm going to take care of you. Wait.
Stay here, son. I'm going to fix this.

587
01:03:38,147 --> 01:03:39,045
-Don't leave!
-You're going to be fine!

588
01:03:39,148 --> 01:03:40,137
Wait for me here!

589
01:03:40,249 --> 01:03:43,241
-Hold him down. Hold him down.
-Don't leave!

590
01:03:45,488 --> 01:03:48,116
Got to break the cables, Daniel!

591
01:03:48,257 --> 01:03:50,122
Get me a hammer!

592
01:03:56,432 --> 01:03:58,263
Get me a hammer!

593
01:04:00,837 --> 01:04:02,532
Here you go.

594
01:04:27,864 --> 01:04:29,195
Get back!

595
01:05:06,836 --> 01:05:08,133
-Michael!
-Sir!

596
01:05:08,237 --> 01:05:10,671
Take Dave and two of the fellas,
pick up some hoses...

597
01:05:10,773 --> 01:05:14,709
Billy, protect the roof.
Don't wait before it gets too hot.

598
01:05:37,099 --> 01:05:39,727
What are you looking
so miserable about?

599
01:05:39,869 --> 01:05:42,702
There's a whole ocean of oil
under our feet!

600
01:05:42,838 --> 01:05:45,500
No one can get at it except for me.

601
01:06:32,221 --> 01:06:33,813
H.W. okay?

602
01:06:34,824 --> 01:06:36,382
No, he isn't.

603
01:06:38,661 --> 01:06:40,993
-Where is he?
-Mess room.

604
01:08:20,196 --> 01:08:23,825
That's enough now.
That's enough, H.W. That's enough.

605
01:08:26,502 --> 01:08:29,528
Do you hear me?
Can you hear me in there?

606
01:08:35,311 --> 01:08:37,006
That's enough.

607
01:08:49,358 --> 01:08:52,122
-Grab his legs.
-I have his legs.

608
01:08:52,228 --> 01:08:54,128
-No. Nope.
-No, lad.

609
01:08:59,802 --> 01:09:01,463
Give me that.

610
01:09:05,708 --> 01:09:06,766
Steady. That's it.

611
01:09:06,876 --> 01:09:09,276
-Easy, boy. Easy.
-Soon be over.

612
01:09:09,378 --> 01:09:13,144
Yeah, and that's good.
Now the other side. Turn him over.

613
01:09:17,086 --> 01:09:18,053
Almost done.

614
01:09:21,590 --> 01:09:23,057
That's it.

615
01:09:23,926 --> 01:09:26,724
Come here. It's over. It's over.

616
01:11:33,022 --> 01:11:35,650
Who do we know in San Francisco

617
01:11:37,226 --> 01:11:39,990
or Los Angeles, who could work with...

618
01:11:42,531 --> 01:11:46,262
You know, we could...
Someone, a teacher for H.W.

619
01:11:50,606 --> 01:11:52,938
How could you figure out that?

620
01:11:53,809 --> 01:11:57,802
Now, call...
God damn it, what's his name?

621
01:11:57,947 --> 01:12:00,245
Bob Brody in San Francisco?

622
01:12:01,417 --> 01:12:04,477
Call Bob Brody
and get someone down here.

623
01:12:11,093 --> 01:12:12,993
I'll do it right away.
