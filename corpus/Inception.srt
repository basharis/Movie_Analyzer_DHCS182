1
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,235
Damm it

2
00:07:00,529 --> 00:07:01,615
Turn around.

3
00:07:02,086 --> 00:07:03,393
Put the gun down, Sun

4
00:07:12,254 --> 00:07:13,341
Please.

5
00:07:24,994 --> 00:07:27,589
And now the envelope, Mr. Cobb.

6
00:07:27,815 --> 00:07:28,894
You said

7
00:07:29,915 --> 00:07:31,319
or you knew all along?

8
00:07:31,912 --> 00:07:37,052
Who came to rob me
or that every time we sleep?

9
00:07:39,841 --> 00:07:43,108
I wonder who hired him.

10
00:07:45,877 --> 00:07:48,990
In the dream, that threaten Down
You can not, is mal?

11
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:51,529
Depends výhružce.

12
00:07:52,762 --> 00:07:55,251
Death, he only wakes up ...

13
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,496
But the pain,

14
00:08:00,491 --> 00:08:02,520
headache.

15
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:06,349
And judging by the decor that
Now in his head, Arthur.

16
00:08:18,896 --> 00:08:22,122
--What is happening is still very early!
I know, but the dream is deteriorating.

17
00:08:22,175 --> 00:08:24,496
I'll try to keep it still uspaného.

18
00:08:24,793 --> 00:08:26,068
I almost was.

19
00:08:57,536 --> 00:08:59,092
Stop it!

20
00:09:01,451 --> 00:09:02,217
SECRET

21
00:09:25,404 --> 00:09:27,153
We think it worked.
Wake him.

22
00:09:48,423 --> 00:09:49,718
He did not want to wake up!

23
00:09:54,698 --> 00:09:56,372
Give him a kick.
--What?

24
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:57,770
Throw it in water.

25
00:10:42,447 --> 00:10:43,347
Is out.

26
00:10:48,656 --> 00:10:50,100
Are you ready?

27
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:54,991
Neither the security did not know anything about that post.
How did you find?

28
00:10:55,723 --> 00:10:59,376
For a man of his position does not
easy to hide the love nest ...

29
00:10:59,476 --> 00:11:02,000
Especially when it was
invited a married woman.

30
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,432
"She never ...
--And yet here we are.

31
00:11:05,175 --> 00:11:07,247
Better hurry, they are close.

32
00:11:07,282 --> 00:11:08,847
You get what you want.

33
00:11:08,882 --> 00:11:09,959
This is not true.

34
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:13,024
You left there is a significant
information, is not it?

35
00:11:13,307 --> 00:11:15,957
You hid, because you
knowing that stealing it.

36
00:11:16,654 --> 00:11:18,493
Why are you doing?

37
00:11:18,528 --> 00:11:20,308
Test.

38
00:11:20,831 --> 00:11:22,390
--What is the test?
It does not matter.

39
00:11:22,738 --> 00:11:23,926
You failed.

40
00:11:23,961 --> 00:11:26,847
Were extracted
any of your information.

41
00:11:26,848 --> 00:11:29,202
But you was too obvious.

42
00:12:10,131 --> 00:12:11,128
It's over.

43
00:12:11,407 --> 00:12:12,700
Send me a deadline.

44
00:12:12,988 --> 00:12:14,694
I think you understand, Mr. Saito.

45
00:12:14,729 --> 00:12:18,746
The Corporation hired us
admit failure.

46
00:12:19,046 --> 00:12:20,817
We have only a few days.

47
00:12:24,379 --> 00:12:26,505
I guess I'll have to
make it easier.

48
00:12:28,071 --> 00:12:29,642
Say what you know!

49
00:12:29,677 --> 00:12:31,351
Immediately tell us!

50
00:12:35,423 --> 00:12:37,734
This carpet
I always hated.

51
00:12:37,834 --> 00:12:43,185
And his strange and ugly
raffishness and omšelost.

52
00:12:44,229 --> 00:12:46,581
I certainly was wool.

53
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:53,067
Now certainly
lying on the polyester.

54
00:12:57,059 --> 00:13:02,043
Which means I'm
on the carpet of his apartment.

55
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:08,407
Confirmed his reputation, Mr. Cobb.
We're still in a dream.

56
00:13:15,242 --> 00:13:16,988
--How you doing?
--Wrong.

57
00:13:22,315 --> 00:13:24,424
A dream within a dream?

58
00:13:25,462 --> 00:13:26,632
I was amazed.

59
00:13:27,863 --> 00:13:31,773
But in my dream you
play by my rules.

60
00:13:32,522 --> 00:13:35,311
--Yes, but you know that Mr. Saito ...
--This is not your dream.

61
00:13:35,411 --> 00:13:36,540
It's mine.

62
00:13:47,395 --> 00:13:50,035
Idiot with the carpet you're fucked.
--How would I know?

63
00:13:50,299 --> 00:13:53,602
You're the architect.
--If nezaboril your nose!

64
00:13:53,711 --> 00:13:54,735
Enough.

65
00:13:55,658 --> 00:13:59,442
--What the hell was that?
--I have everything under control.

66
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,020
So I do not want to see if you do.

67
00:14:01,021 --> 00:14:03,427
At this time we do not.

68
00:14:03,462 --> 00:14:07,062
In Kyoto vystopím.
--You can search the entire train.

69
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:11,399
I do not like trains.
Every man for himself now.

70
00:15:25,746 --> 00:15:28,985
"Yes, Hello?
--Hi, Dad.

71
00:15:29,689 --> 00:15:31,386
Kids, Hello!

72
00:15:31,737 --> 00:15:33,289
How are you?

73
00:15:33,961 --> 00:15:36,091
--Ok.
"I guess.

74
00:15:36,126 --> 00:15:37,608
Ok?

75
00:15:38,452 --> 00:15:41,290
--Who said good? Is this James?
--Yes.

76
00:15:41,911 --> 00:15:43,932
You come home, Dad?

77
00:15:44,936 --> 00:15:47,343
I can not, honey.

78
00:15:47,962 --> 00:15:49,887
We talked about it, remember?

79
00:15:47,962 --> 00:15:49,887
We talked about it, remember?

80
00:15:52,494 --> 00:15:55,919
I said I was gone,
because I work.

81
00:15:55,954 --> 00:15:57,084
Yeah?

82
00:15:57,119 --> 00:15:59,646
The grandmother said she had not returned.

83
00:16:01,322 --> 00:16:02,490
Phillip, are you?

84
00:16:03,306 --> 00:16:05,938
Give me a grandmother on the phone.

85
00:16:05,973 --> 00:16:07,813
Shakes his head.

86
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:12,501
We hope that they are wrong.

87
00:16:13,849 --> 00:16:15,310
Father?

88
00:16:15,351 --> 00:16:16,637
Yes Jamie,?

89
00:16:16,672 --> 00:16:18,315
Mom is with you?

90
00:16:21,135 --> 00:16:23,268
I told you ...

91
00:16:24,109 --> 00:16:26,947
Mom was not with us.

92
00:16:27,912 --> 00:16:29,382
Why?
Well--Child, Say goodbye.

93
00:16:33,765 --> 00:16:37,148
I send you some gifts for grandpa.

94
00:16:37,149 --> 00:16:38,294
And forgive me ...

95
00:16:48,414 --> 00:16:50,677
The helicopter is on the roof.

96
00:16:57,965 --> 00:16:59,189
Are you okay?

97
00:16:59,363 --> 00:17:01,356
Yes, I'm fine.
Why?

98
00:17:01,391 --> 00:17:04,995
In the dream showed Mal

99
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:07,075
Sorry for the lower leg.
That will not happen again.

100
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:10,528
Getting worse?
An apology is not enough?

101
00:17:11,023 --> 00:17:13,474
Nash--s Where?
Still--appeared. Let's wait?

102
00:17:13,475 --> 00:17:19,074
There, he went to the COBOL
two hours ago. They know that we have failed.

103
00:17:13,475 --> 00:17:19,074
There, he went to the COBOL
two hours ago. They know that we have failed.

104
00:17:22,229 --> 00:17:24,229
--Where are you?
--Buenos Aires.

105
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:29,708
--I have some work to do. And you?
--The E.U..

106
00:17:30,441 --> 00:17:32,075
Say Hello there.

107
00:17:38,062 --> 00:17:41,980
Sold you.
He came to the company asking for his life.

108
00:17:43,785 --> 00:17:46,113
I offer you a reward.

109
00:17:49,103 --> 00:17:51,466
I do not do that.

110
00:18:04,162 --> 00:18:05,634
What we do with it?

111
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:07,096
I am nothing.

112
00:18:07,984 --> 00:18:10,614
But I can not speak
Engineering for the Cobol.

113
00:18:24,576 --> 00:18:26,378
What you want from us?

114
00:18:27,129 --> 00:18:28,217
Inspiration.

115
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,506
--Is it possible?
--Of course not.

116
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:36,289
When you are able to steal the idea
mind, why you can not even put it?

117
00:18:36,324 --> 00:18:38,561
Well, now you inspire the idea.

118
00:18:38,596 --> 00:18:40,766
Say, "I do not think of elephants."

119
00:18:40,801 --> 00:18:41,985
What do you think? "

120
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,051
For elephants.

121
00:18:43,086 --> 00:18:46,370
Yes, but it is not your idea
knowing that I gave to you.

122
00:18:46,405 --> 00:18:51,579
Mind always know the origin of ideas.
Inspiration can not be falsified.

123
00:18:51,614 --> 00:18:52,589
This is not true.

124
00:18:55,452 --> 00:18:58,082
"You can?
Give me a choice?

125
00:18:58,984 --> 00:19:01,319
Because the COBOL
I can help.

126
00:19:01,354 --> 00:19:03,340
So you have a choice.

127
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:05,466
And I chose to leave, sir.

128
00:19:10,226 --> 00:19:12,388
Tell the group to go.

129
00:19:10,226 --> 00:19:12,388
Tell the group to go.

130
00:19:21,653 --> 00:19:23,480
How would you like to go home?

131
00:19:24,146 --> 00:19:27,526
For America.
Their children.

132
00:19:28,433 --> 00:19:29,862
This can not.

133
00:19:29,897 --> 00:19:31,599
Nobody can do.

134
00:19:31,634 --> 00:19:33,360
inspiration as well.

135
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:34,579
Cobb, c'mon.

136
00:19:38,766 --> 00:19:40,237
As this is a complicated
thought to be?

137
00:19:40,238 --> 00:19:41,469
Very simple.

138
00:19:41,504 --> 00:19:45,578
Nothing is simple when you have someone
implanted in his mind.

139
00:19:45,613 --> 00:19:52,757
My rival is a very old man.
Coming soon die and the son inherits the business.

140
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:57,716
I have decided
sell his father's empire.

141
00:19:58,542 --> 00:20:00,589
Not to let it be.
--Wait.

142
00:20:03,088 --> 00:20:06,364
If you're going to try ...
If possible,

143
00:20:06,399 --> 00:20:08,522
I guarantee it.

144
00:20:08,557 --> 00:20:10,159
How do I know that you also make a deal?

145
00:20:10,194 --> 00:20:11,926
No.

146
00:20:12,546 --> 00:20:13,877
But I'll do it.

147
00:20:14,272 --> 00:20:15,839
So ...

148
00:20:16,544 --> 00:20:18,785
Decide on possible hope

149
00:20:19,323 --> 00:20:23,426
or older with no remorse?

150
00:20:23,603 --> 00:20:25,739
Waiting for a lonely death.

151
00:20:28,933 --> 00:20:31,033
Gather your team.

152
00:20:31,199 --> 00:20:33,152
Time and choose carefully.

153
00:20:41,551 --> 00:20:43,903
I know how much you want to go home.

154
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:47,597
But that does not take us.

155
00:20:47,632 --> 00:20:49,864
Lead.

156
00:20:49,899 --> 00:20:52,436
--Just have to go deeper.
I do not know.

157
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:56,228
I have achieved.

158
00:20:57,330 --> 00:20:58,859
Who did you do?

159
00:21:03,939 --> 00:21:05,250
Why fly to Paris?

160
00:21:07,237 --> 00:21:09,248
We need a new architect.

161
00:21:25,859 --> 00:21:28,211
You never had an office like this?

162
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:32,432
The chamber, there is no place
to think.

163
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:36,733
Not for you
dangerous to be here?

164
00:21:38,546 --> 00:21:42,515
Issue of criminals between France and the E.U.
bureaucrats is a nightmare. They do not like him.

165
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:45,632
In your case, you will surely find.

166
00:21:45,667 --> 00:21:50,844
Look, I wish you
this could pass for children.

167
00:21:50,879 --> 00:21:55,955
animals want things
to prove that the loss of a parent?

168
00:21:56,708 --> 00:21:59,082
Just do what I do and
Because you taught me.

169
00:21:59,896 --> 00:22:01,549
I taught you to be a thief.

170
00:22:01,584 --> 00:22:05,104
Ucils me to control the human mind.
And after what happened

171
00:22:05,204 --> 00:22:08,503
Now I can legally use.

172
00:22:14,001 --> 00:22:15,496
What are you doing here, Don?

173
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:19,689
I think I found my way home.

174
00:22:19,724 --> 00:22:24,099
Too much work for
influential people.

175
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:27,949
People who can delete
my permanent record.

176
00:22:29,226 --> 00:22:30,429
But I need your help.

177
00:22:31,216 --> 00:22:34,454
You're here to bring the
avert my best students.

178
00:22:34,489 --> 00:22:37,341
You know what to offer.
Must decide for yourself.

179
00:22:37,376 --> 00:22:40,324
--Money.
--Not only that, remember?

180
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:48,826
Chance to build a cathedral and the city
that could not exist in reality.

181
00:22:49,485 --> 00:22:54,532
So you want to take you to your
fantasy followed by another person.

182
00:22:54,567 --> 00:23:00,371
May not enter. Fair
elaborate and explain them spácum.

183
00:23:00,406 --> 00:23:02,148
Suggests that it is himself.

184
00:23:03,689 --> 00:23:05,743
mal does not allow me.

185
00:23:12,029 --> 00:23:14,985
Snap back to reality, Sun

186
00:23:15,698 --> 00:23:17,787
Please.

187
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:24,667
My children, grandchildren,
waiting for his father. That is the reality.

188
00:23:24,702 --> 00:23:28,822
And this latest work
I stand with them.

189
00:23:28,823 --> 00:23:32,727
I was there,
I knew otherwise.

190
00:23:35,518 --> 00:23:38,615
I need an architect as well
as good as I was.

191
00:23:43,052 --> 00:23:44,854
I have someone better.

192
00:23:44,955 --> 00:23:45,955
Ariadne?

193
00:23:48,861 --> 00:23:50,847
I would like to introduce you
Mr. Cobb.

194
00:23:48,861 --> 00:23:50,847
I would like to introduce you
Mr. Cobb.

195
00:23:52,763 --> 00:23:57,326
Mr. Cobb is for you
employment.

196
00:23:57,630 --> 00:24:00,169
--Employment?
--Not quite.

197
00:23:57,630 --> 00:24:00,169
--Employment?
--Not quite.

198
00:24:03,049 --> 00:24:04,505
You do not want me first
sth about?

199
00:24:05,197 --> 00:24:07,756
Before doing so, I know
you have.

200
00:24:07,791 --> 00:24:08,706
Why?

201
00:24:08,741 --> 00:24:11,419
It's not exactly legal.

202
00:24:13,874 --> 00:24:18,742
Draw a maze in two minutes,
whose solution will take a minute.

203
00:24:20,408 --> 00:24:21,308
Stop.

204
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:25,120
Again.

205
00:24:27,243 --> 00:24:28,376
Stop.

206
00:24:32,176 --> 00:24:33,328
You need to do better.

207
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,313
That's better.

208
00:25:08,782 --> 00:25:13,388
When we awake, we use only
a small part of the brain's capacity.

209
00:25:13,423 --> 00:25:17,589
"When we sleep, it's the opposite.
--What do you mean?

210
00:25:17,624 --> 00:25:19,779
Imagine it as a
designing buildings.

211
00:25:19,914 --> 00:25:24,658
You create each detail. But sometimes it
as would be suggested itself.

212
00:25:24,693 --> 00:25:25,889
--Know what I mean?
--Yes.

213
00:25:25,924 --> 00:25:30,130
--How it to appear.
Auto inspiration.

214
00:25:30,334 --> 00:25:38,255
In the dream, we do it constantly.
We create and perceive the world.

215
00:25:38,355 --> 00:25:42,260
Mind does well there,
do not realize.

216
00:25:42,657 --> 00:25:45,214
And we're right in the middle.

217
00:25:45,249 --> 00:25:49,330
--How? --Here is the creative part
for what you need.

218
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:51,536
You create a world of dreams.

219
00:25:52,011 --> 00:25:54,155
Bring it to our body

220
00:25:54,739 --> 00:25:56,774
and he filled my subconscious.

221
00:25:57,588 --> 00:26:02,251
How could it be possible to create
many details, then everything fell realistically?

222
00:26:02,286 --> 00:26:06,163
In the dream we all seem real, right?

223
00:26:06,509 --> 00:26:10,301
Only when you wake
realize, as were special.

224
00:26:11,485 --> 00:26:16,398
You never knew you
Top remembered dream?

225
00:26:16,433 --> 00:26:19,468
You were always right
middle of the action, right?

226
00:26:19,503 --> 00:26:22,463
--Probably.
--And how did we get here?

227
00:26:22,498 --> 00:26:24,089
We come from ...

228
00:26:24,785 --> 00:26:28,207
Think Ariadne,
How did we get here?

229
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:31,328
Where exactly are we?

230
00:26:34,513 --> 00:26:37,784
--We are in a dream?
"You're lying in our office.

231
00:26:37,819 --> 00:26:40,745
Calm down, this is the first lesson.

232
00:27:19,045 --> 00:27:20,685
Although it is only a dream
Why protect your face?

233
00:27:21,559 --> 00:27:23,171
It is never just a dream.

234
00:27:23,206 --> 00:27:28,051
Fragments in the face of insane pain.
Headache is real.

235
00:27:28,086 --> 00:27:30,748
Therefore, the Army began to develop.
For military training.

236
00:27:30,783 --> 00:27:34,387
Soldiers were able to kill and
only by touch.

237
00:27:34,815 --> 00:27:37,284
Why you need an architect?

238
00:27:37,319 --> 00:27:39,431
Someone has to dream design.

239
00:27:37,319 --> 00:27:39,431
Someone has to dream design.

240
00:27:43,044 --> 00:27:46,249
Five minutes?

241
00:27:46,284 --> 00:27:48,451
We talked for an hour.

242
00:27:48,844 --> 00:27:51,857
During sleep
brain works faster.

243
00:27:51,892 --> 00:27:54,160
So, time passes slowly.

244
00:27:54,195 --> 00:27:56,619
Five minutes in the real world
Is the time in a dream.

245
00:27:54,195 --> 00:27:56,619
Five minutes in the real world
Is the time in a dream.

246
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:12,021
This is the basic peripherals.
Library, coffee, almost everything.

247
00:28:12,056 --> 00:28:13,322
Who are these people?

248
00:28:13,357 --> 00:28:15,875
Projection of my subconscious.
--Your?

249
00:28:13,357 --> 00:28:15,875
Projection of my subconscious.
--Your?

250
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:24,398
You can talk to
My subconscious.

251
00:28:24,498 --> 00:28:26,342
It then extracts information.

252
00:28:26,729 --> 00:28:27,878
What else are you doing?

253
00:28:28,762 --> 00:28:32,851
Create something safe,
as safe or phone.

254
00:28:32,951 --> 00:28:36,294
The subconscious mind will automatically
filled with information that he wants to protect.

255
00:28:36,329 --> 00:28:39,079
"Okay?
--There and steal it?

256
00:28:36,329 --> 00:28:39,079
"Okay?
--There and steal it?

257
00:28:42,452 --> 00:28:46,762
I thought the dream is primarily
visual, but it's basically a feeling.

258
00:28:47,449 --> 00:28:51,256
What happens when
pohrajete you with physics?

259
00:29:32,834 --> 00:29:36,294
--These are things?
That's true.

260
00:30:01,418 --> 00:30:03,193
Why look at me?

261
00:30:03,228 --> 00:30:06,406
Because my subconscious feels
someone who creates this world.

262
00:30:06,441 --> 00:30:10,304
The more you change,
the subconscious will be more aggressive.

263
00:30:10,822 --> 00:30:11,778
Aggressive?

264
00:30:11,813 --> 00:30:14,297
It's natural protection.

265
00:30:14,332 --> 00:30:17,285
As the white blood cells attack the virus.

266
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,685
Attack us?
No..

267
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:21,463
Just for you.

268
00:30:26,529 --> 00:30:29,546
Nice, but really you
She has not changed much.

269
00:30:34,219 --> 00:30:36,799
Let me
unconscious in the bedroom.

270
00:30:36,834 --> 00:30:39,828
It is the subconscious control over it.

271
00:31:32,961 --> 00:31:34,660
Really impressive.

272
00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:47,913
I know this bridge.

273
00:31:48,397 --> 00:31:50,143
It's true.

274
00:31:50,178 --> 00:31:52,345
Yes, I pass here every day to school.

275
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:56,204
Never Do not create in its memory.
Always the latest news!

276
00:31:56,239 --> 00:31:57,990
You must know
based on things they know.

277
00:31:58,025 --> 00:31:59,453
Use only the details.

278
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:02,292
Streetlight, a telephone booth.
Never in the entire region.

279
00:32:02,327 --> 00:32:03,229
Why not?

280
00:32:03,264 --> 00:32:08,419
Since the stop
distinguish reality from dreams.

281
00:32:08,454 --> 00:32:09,417
It has happened to you?

282
00:32:09,452 --> 00:32:12,099
Look, this is not a game, right?

283
00:32:12,631 --> 00:32:14,169
Then you need me,
I formed a dream?

284
00:32:14,686 --> 00:32:15,934
Give your room.

285
00:32:17,053 --> 00:32:17,933
Get out!

286
00:32:17,053 --> 00:32:17,933
Get out!

287
00:32:24,332 --> 00:32:25,782
mal!

288
00:32:25,817 --> 00:32:27,084
Wake me!

289
00:32:30,734 --> 00:32:32,076
Are you okay?

290
00:32:34,099 --> 00:32:36,084
Because I could not wake up?

291
00:32:37,197 --> 00:32:40,928
Nedobehl longer. Otherwise
You can wake up only to death.

292
00:32:40,929 --> 00:32:43,010
Explain totem.
--What?

293
00:32:43,045 --> 00:32:44,705
Totem is small --

294
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:48,217
This is your subconscious
beautiful woman annoying!

295
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:51,117
So you see Ms. Cobb?

296
00:32:51,152 --> 00:32:52,178
It was his wife?

297
00:32:52,213 --> 00:32:56,766
Yes Totem is so small
object that only you know,

298
00:32:56,801 --> 00:32:59,450
'What nobody needs to know.
--Like a coin?

299
00:32:59,485 --> 00:33:02,005
None unikátnejšího something.

300
00:33:02,613 --> 00:33:04,641
Ping as a hub.

301
00:33:06,884 --> 00:33:13,040
You can not borrow it, which is its meaning.
I just know that your balance and weight.

302
00:33:13,496 --> 00:33:17,894
When we look at your totem, you will
I know you dream of someone.

303
00:33:22,015 --> 00:33:28,313
I do not know if I can not see, or ignore,
But Cobb has serious problems

304
00:33:28,413 --> 00:33:30,271
trying to hide there.

305
00:33:28,413 --> 00:33:30,271
trying to hide there.

306
00:33:39,689 --> 00:33:41,289
She returns.

307
00:33:41,324 --> 00:33:44,025
Nobody learned so quickly.

308
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:48,443
The reality of today will not suffice.
Returns.

309
00:33:49,397 --> 00:33:52,731
Explain you then maze.
--Where you going?

310
00:33:53,011 --> 00:33:56,490
Visit Eames.
"But he is in Mombasa.

311
00:33:56,741 --> 00:33:59,250
--It is around the corner.
Must--risk.

312
00:33:59,285 --> 00:34:02,191
It is full of good--thieves.
--We need more than that.

313
00:34:03,913 --> 00:34:05,248
We need to counterfeiters.

314
00:34:14,078 --> 00:34:16,302
You rub all you want
But nerozmnoží.

315
00:34:16,844 --> 00:34:17,831
You never know.

316
00:34:19,033 --> 00:34:20,310
Come for a drink.

317
00:34:23,085 --> 00:34:24,017
You pay.

318
00:35:21,018 --> 00:35:23,129
So what's the idea
you need to give?

319
00:35:23,229 --> 00:35:27,172
Heir of large companies should
dissolve the empire of her father.

320
00:35:27,272 --> 00:35:31,454
It stretches very political
motivation and ambition of antitrust.

321
00:35:31,455 --> 00:35:39,985
Lots of emotions and prejudices of the body ...
You would have to begin to complete the foundations.

322
00:35:40,168 --> 00:35:41,744
What is it?

323
00:35:41,779 --> 00:35:43,508
Relationship with his father.

324
00:35:46,053 --> 00:35:47,831
--You have a chemist?
--No, not yet.

325
00:35:47,866 --> 00:35:54,830
Okay, there's a man, Yusuf,
what confuses its own revenue.

326
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:57,598
--Will you marry me for it?
--First, get rid of the monitor.

327
00:35:58,662 --> 00:36:00,961
--The man at the bar.
Cobol Engineering.

328
00:36:01,061 --> 00:36:03,820
Place a reward for me.
You do not know whether dead or alive?

329
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,855
I have no idea.
See if it starts firing.

330
00:36:05,856 --> 00:36:10,820
Let's get together for half an hour here.
--Here?

331
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,713
The last place to look.

332
00:36:17,104 --> 00:36:17,788
Fred!

333
00:36:18,189 --> 00:36:19,432
Simmonds Fredy?

334
00:36:19,467 --> 00:36:20,809
--What?
--Yes you are!

335
00:36:24,311 --> 00:36:25,789
Well, probably not.

336
00:36:25,917 --> 00:36:27,284
This does not seem to you huh?

337
00:37:06,735 --> 00:37:08,252
A cup of coffee.

338
00:38:19,419 --> 00:38:20,976
You need a taxi, Mr. Cobb?

339
00:38:22,112 --> 00:38:25,739
--What do you do in Mombasa?
, Protect your investment.

340
00:38:29,772 --> 00:38:32,778
--So you finally got caught?
But somebody else.

341
00:38:41,298 --> 00:38:43,185
Cobb said he will return.

342
00:38:44,259 --> 00:38:48,046
--I do not want to go back.
But nothing compares to it.

343
00:38:48,081 --> 00:38:49,254
It's just ...

344
00:38:51,047 --> 00:38:52,544
pure creation.

345
00:38:52,856 --> 00:38:55,787
Let's see
architecture paradoxical?

346
00:38:55,823 --> 00:38:59,061
You have to learn a few tricks, if
To create complex worlds.

347
00:38:59,679 --> 00:39:02,757
Sorry.
--What are the tricks?

348
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:08,847
Unable to create forms.
Make a closed loop.

349
00:39:08,848 --> 00:39:13,301
Like this ...
Endless stairs.

350
00:39:16,165 --> 00:39:17,167
See?

351
00:39:21,655 --> 00:39:22,886
Paradox.

352
00:39:22,897 --> 00:39:27,900
Similar loops help
hide the borders of dreams.

353
00:39:27,901 --> 00:39:33,043
--How great can it be?
--From a walk to entire cities.

354
00:39:33,044 --> 00:39:36,678
But it must be quite complicated,
we hide from projections.

355
00:39:36,679 --> 00:39:38,176
--So the Maze?
--Maze.

356
00:39:38,276 --> 00:39:39,750
Or, even better.

357
00:39:39,850 --> 00:39:42,205
Where we are
projection get?

358
00:39:42,722 --> 00:39:43,623
Exactly.

359
00:39:44,582 --> 00:39:46,383
My subconscious behaves
pretty decent.

360
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:50,849
Just wait, you will also rebel.
Nobody can resist when he dig in his head.

361
00:39:51,505 --> 00:39:53,305
Cobb could not create it?

362
00:39:55,632 --> 00:39:57,541
Do not know if you can, but do not want.

363
00:39:57,721 --> 00:39:59,852
He says it's safer,
he does not know the details.

364
00:40:00,053 --> 00:40:01,893
Why?
"I do not tell me.

365
00:40:02,651 --> 00:40:03,814
I think because of mal

366
00:40:04,344 --> 00:40:06,610
His ex--?
Not the former.

367
00:40:06,645 --> 00:40:08,577
Are they still together?
No..

368
00:40:10,967 --> 00:40:12,003
Is dead.

369
00:40:13,884 --> 00:40:16,496
You saw only a projection.

370
00:40:20,561 --> 00:40:24,026
--How was it?
"She was amazing.

371
00:40:27,892 --> 00:40:32,604
Are you looking for a pharmacy to prepare
compost in your order.

372
00:40:33,288 --> 00:40:35,304
And go with us in the field.

373
00:40:35,339 --> 00:40:37,707
I do not do that, Mr. Cobb.

374
00:40:38,167 --> 00:40:41,477
We want substance
our specific needs.

375
00:40:41,512 --> 00:40:42,799
What are they?

376
00:40:42,834 --> 00:40:44,115
stability.

377
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:47,049
A dream within a dream?
Thus, two levels ...

378
00:40:49,876 --> 00:40:50,991
Three.

379
00:40:51,194 --> 00:40:52,546
It is impossible.

380
00:40:52,581 --> 00:40:57,086
The level is very unstable.
--Can.

381
00:40:57,563 --> 00:41:01,649
We have to use a tranquilizer.
No, a heavy sedative.

382
00:41:03,298 --> 00:41:05,504
--How many team members?
Five.

383
00:41:05,988 --> 00:41:07,329
Six.

384
00:41:08,548 --> 00:41:12,558
I'll go with you to know
who have completed the task.

385
00:41:12,559 --> 00:41:16,003
There is no place for tourists,
Mr. Saito.

386
00:41:16,038 --> 00:41:18,253
This time will be.

387
00:41:19,339 --> 00:41:23,158
This is a good start.
I use daily.

388
00:41:23,193 --> 00:41:25,804
--What?
Let me show you.

389
00:41:29,248 --> 00:41:31,248
Maybe you do not want to see.

390
00:41:33,735 --> 00:41:35,401
Please.

391
00:41:45,278 --> 00:41:48,410
Have ... Twelve subscribers.
How do you prove it?

392
00:41:48,411 --> 00:41:50,460
They come here every day,
to dream of a common dream.

393
00:41:52,825 --> 00:41:55,515
See? Very stable.

394
00:42:01,066 --> 00:42:04,057
--How long are they connected?
--A few hours.

395
00:42:04,092 --> 00:42:05,730
Every day.

396
00:42:05,731 --> 00:42:10,744
One time in a dream?
About forty hours per day.

397
00:42:10,779 --> 00:42:13,463
--Why do they do?
--Tell him, Mr. Cobb.

398
00:42:15,162 --> 00:42:18,110
After some time, is
only one way to dream.

399
00:42:18,145 --> 00:42:22,437
"You have dreams, Mr. Cobb?
Dream--come here every day?

400
00:42:22,472 --> 00:42:23,555
No.

401
00:42:25,967 --> 00:42:27,976
They come here to awaken.

402
00:42:29,517 --> 00:42:32,467
Dream became reality.

403
00:42:33,932 --> 00:42:35,906
You have the right to require that, otherwise?

404
00:42:38,128 --> 00:42:40,046
Let's see what you can do.

405
00:42:51,585 --> 00:42:53,410
You know how to find me.

406
00:42:55,383 --> 00:42:57,225
You know what to do.

407
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:03,936
Fair, right?

408
00:43:19,274 --> 00:43:21,314
You're right, Mr. Cobb?

409
00:43:22,561 --> 00:43:23,432
Yes.

410
00:43:24,441 --> 00:43:26,109
Fine.

411
00:43:34,814 --> 00:43:38,750
Robert Fischer, heir
energy conglomerate.

412
00:43:38,850 --> 00:43:40,539
And what you have with this
Robert Fischer?

413
00:43:40,574 --> 00:43:42,085
This is not your thing.

414
00:43:42,429 --> 00:43:46,634
Mr. Saito, the
no ordinary spy.

415
00:43:47,133 --> 00:43:52,104
Calls for inspiration and I hope
you understand the seriousness of this requirement.

416
00:43:53,293 --> 00:43:56,675
We planted a seed in your mind that
men who grow up in the idea.

417
00:43:56,775 --> 00:44:02,874
The idea is to define.
He can change his personality.

418
00:44:03,252 --> 00:44:07,071
We're the last company that makes
the monopoly of global energy.

419
00:44:07,381 --> 00:44:09,252
And you can not stay long.

420
00:44:09,637 --> 00:44:12,685
Coming soon will be marked
power supply for half the world.

421
00:44:13,824 --> 00:44:15,930
Thus, if in fact
new superpower.

422
00:44:17,183 --> 00:44:20,314
World needs, Robert
Fischer changed his position.

423
00:44:21,238 --> 00:44:25,628
And here we have on.
What is the relationship with your father?

424
00:44:25,704 --> 00:44:31,554
--Said to be a little tricky.
--We need more than just talk.

425
00:44:31,571 --> 00:44:33,421
Organize my approach to this one man?

426
00:44:33,596 --> 00:44:34,533
Browning.

427
00:44:35,167 --> 00:44:38,594
Right elder Fischer,
Fischer sponsored youth.

428
00:44:38,685 --> 00:44:42,286
This should not be difficult
You just need a good reference.

429
00:44:42,321 --> 00:44:46,674
Referrals are my
specialty, Mr. Saito.

430
00:44:47,759 --> 00:44:50,771
She walked me patience.
Get rid of them.

431
00:44:50,871 --> 00:44:55,288
Joschka Fischer, Maurice Browning
always trying to avoid court.

432
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:03,037
You want to check it myself
directly with Maurice?

433
00:45:03,694 --> 00:45:06,891
"I think it is not necessary.
--No, I think we should.

434
00:45:28,546 --> 00:45:29,768
How is he?

435
00:45:30,896 --> 00:45:33,261
I would not bother you if
It was not necessary, but ...

436
00:45:57,536 --> 00:45:59,735
It must be your precious memories.

437
00:46:00,276 --> 00:46:04,658
I put him to bed.
Also recorded.

438
00:46:09,489 --> 00:46:12,345
We need to talk about
legal issues.

439
00:46:12,533 --> 00:46:14,981
--Not now.
"But it's important.

440
00:46:19,466 --> 00:46:25,517
As Maurice Fischer loses power
Peter Browning receives it.

441
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:28,578
I had many opportunities
Browning observed.

442
00:46:28,636 --> 00:46:32,854
Learn to imitate his speech,
studying the sign ...

443
00:46:32,855 --> 00:46:36,715
Thus, the first level, I dream
I am a Browning.

444
00:46:37,679 --> 00:46:40,282
The nadhodím Fischer
mind to think about it.

445
00:46:40,557 --> 00:46:46,365
When we get a deeper level, their own
Browning design he recalls.

446
00:46:46,641 --> 00:46:49,339
--He can create the idea?
--Exactly.

447
00:46:50,234 --> 00:46:52,836
Only then will be stable,
must create it.

448
00:46:53,643 --> 00:46:55,624
Eames, I'm impressed.

449
00:46:56,266 --> 00:46:59,693
I greatly appreciate your disdain,
Thanks Arthur.

450
00:47:21,410 --> 00:47:23,073
You connect with yourself?

451
00:47:23,108 --> 00:47:26,691
No, I did some testing.

452
00:47:27,183 --> 00:47:29,131
I did not know anyone there.

453
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:31,693
I finished my totem.

454
00:47:31,728 --> 00:47:33,451
View.

455
00:47:35,429 --> 00:47:40,227
"You learn quickly.
An elegant solution for the recognition of reality.

456
00:47:40,783 --> 00:47:42,196
It was his idea?

457
00:47:42,231 --> 00:47:45,504
No, really evil thought

458
00:47:46,543 --> 00:47:50,360
This was her. When he turned
in a dream, never stop.

459
00:47:50,516 --> 00:47:53,487
Just more spin.

460
00:47:54,647 --> 00:48:00,272
Arthur told me he died.
--As he continues with the labyrinth?

461
00:47:54,647 --> 00:48:00,272
Arthur told me he died.
--As he continues with the labyrinth?

462
00:47:54,647 --> 00:48:00,272
Arthur told me he died.
--As he continues with the labyrinth?

463
00:48:06,205 --> 00:48:10,210
At the lowest level will be
Hospital, where he finds his father Fisher.

464
00:48:12,005 --> 00:48:14,105
I should have
request for this area ...

465
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:18,311
No, do not show me the details.
Only one person should know who sleeps map.

466
00:48:18,892 --> 00:48:20,970
Why it should be?

467
00:48:21,005 --> 00:48:25,048
Because there are our projections.
We do not want to know the details.

468
00:48:26,635 --> 00:48:30,694
You mean like when you bring mal?
Can not get rid of it, right?

469
00:48:32,573 --> 00:48:34,809
--Yes.
So netvoríš.

470
00:48:34,844 --> 00:48:39,700
When you know the details, he knows it too.
Sabotaged the entire operation.

471
00:48:40,457 --> 00:48:42,271
Cobb--know the rest?
--No, I do not know.

472
00:48:42,306 --> 00:48:44,967
You should be warned
you could do worse.

473
00:48:45,002 --> 00:48:46,601
Nothing will get worse.

474
00:48:48,298 --> 00:48:51,109
I just need to get home
Nothing else was irrelevant.

475
00:48:52,726 --> 00:48:54,410
Why can not you home?

476
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:59,728
Because he thinks he killed her.

477
00:49:03,131 --> 00:49:05,666
--Thanks.
--For what?

478
00:49:05,899 --> 00:49:07,416
Nepta that if I did.

479
00:49:08,216 --> 00:49:13,299
"Divide the empire from his father."
That was never Fischer did not.

480
00:49:14,884 --> 00:49:17,581
Therefore, we must find a way
How to give it.

481
00:49:17,616 --> 00:49:21,060
The subconscious mind is driven by emotion.

482
00:49:21,095 --> 00:49:25,211
We must find ways
how to translate that emotion.

483
00:49:25,246 --> 00:49:27,745
How do you want to convert the business to the emotions?

484
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:29,255
Now it should come.

485
00:49:29,290 --> 00:49:33,454
We can use the relationship with his father Roberto.

486
00:49:33,489 --> 00:49:38,474
We suggest that the destruction of his father
Empire is an appropriate revenge.

487
00:49:38,510 --> 00:49:42,247
No, positive emotions
have much more power.

488
00:49:42,282 --> 00:49:44,295
We need reconciliation, catharsis.

489
00:49:46,085 --> 00:49:49,906
We must do everything
Robert had a positive emotion.

490
00:49:49,941 --> 00:49:51,210
So try to be ...

491
00:49:52,204 --> 00:49:56,690
"My father wanted me alone accounted
if not, just go in his footsteps. "

492
00:49:57,182 --> 00:49:59,759
--Can run.
-- "It"?

493
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:03,762
--We need more than that.
--Thanks for your feedback, Arthur.

494
00:50:03,859 --> 00:50:06,006
Excuse me, I want something specific.

495
00:50:07,107 --> 00:50:08,379
Specific.

496
00:50:08,388 --> 00:50:11,545
Whispers of the individual is not
issues, should solve the mind.

497
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:13,383
Should be sown and let it grow.

498
00:50:15,306 --> 00:50:18,521
At the highest level
open relationship with his father.

499
00:50:18,967 --> 00:50:21,970
Say something like
"I will not go into his father's footsteps."

500
00:50:22,114 --> 00:50:24,171
At the next level
priživíme the idea.

501
00:50:24,397 --> 00:50:27,090
"This will create something for himself."

502
00:50:27,093 --> 00:50:30,222
At the lowest level
sharper pull gauge.

503
00:50:30,257 --> 00:50:32,523
-- "My father wants me to follow him?
--Exactly.

504
00:50:33,801 --> 00:50:37,923
At the third level, we agree
the slightest disturbance.

505
00:50:37,988 --> 00:50:40,311
Sedatives.

506
00:50:40,446 --> 00:50:46,074
To deal with three levels, will
extémne need strong sedatives.

507
00:50:57,751 --> 00:50:58,954
Good night.

508
00:50:59,677 --> 00:51:04,211
Cobb, prepare it
three levels.

509
00:51:04,422 --> 00:51:06,269
It accelerates the activity of the brain.

510
00:51:06,305 --> 00:51:08,315
We get more time at each level.

511
00:51:08,350 --> 00:51:11,224
Brain activity in a dream
about twenty times faster.

512
00:51:11,844 --> 00:51:13,339
If you dream a dream within a dream ...

513
00:51:13,851 --> 00:51:16,951
He is constantly growing.
Three dreams of ten hours.

514
00:51:17,051 --> 00:51:18,890
Sorry, mathematics
not my forte.

515
00:51:17,051 --> 00:51:18,890
Sorry, mathematics
not my forte.

516
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:22,684
Week of first level.

517
00:51:23,732 --> 00:51:25,637
The second half of the year.

518
00:51:26,468 --> 00:51:28,084
--The third --
--Ten years!

519
00:51:31,341 --> 00:51:33,366
Who wants to live
in ten years, a dream?

520
00:51:33,906 --> 00:51:35,167
Depends on the dream.

521
00:51:35,202 --> 00:51:37,847
And how do we leave?

522
00:51:38,282 --> 00:51:41,002
We find something more elegant,
a shot in the head, yes?

523
00:51:41,037 --> 00:51:42,486
Kick.

524
00:51:42,942 --> 00:51:45,934
--What is it?
--This is a kick.

525
00:51:48,818 --> 00:51:51,673
Feel that you fall.

526
00:51:51,708 --> 00:51:55,193
Well, wake up.
She'll feel more sedation?

527
00:51:55,194 --> 00:51:56,414
I arrange.

528
00:51:56,449 --> 00:51:59,426
I mixed them
the inner ear is working.

529
00:51:59,526 --> 00:52:04,124
All you deeply,
still feel the fall.

530
00:52:04,964 --> 00:52:06,354
I pushed.

531
00:52:08,103 --> 00:52:11,948
It is crucial to synchronize
Kicks at all levels.

532
00:52:12,548 --> 00:52:15,189
You can use the music.

533
00:52:24,155 --> 00:52:27,801
scheduled surgery,
or dentistry. Nothing.

534
00:52:27,904 --> 00:52:30,630
--He's not going to knee surgery?
--Nothing.

535
00:52:30,665 --> 00:52:32,383
No chance
he would sleep.

536
00:52:32,483 --> 00:52:34,869
And what we need at least
ten hours of sleep.

537
00:52:34,904 --> 00:52:39,587
The flight from Sydney to Los Angeles.
One of the longest in the world.

538
00:52:39,623 --> 00:52:41,517
He flies them every two weeks.

539
00:52:42,318 --> 00:52:43,843
Must be a private jet.

540
00:52:44,987 --> 00:52:47,991
This may have an unexpected failure.

541
00:52:48,389 --> 00:52:50,628
--We need 747
Why?

542
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:54,026
You have a cockpit on top.
The first class is way ahead.

543
00:52:54,126 --> 00:52:55,865
Nobody passes through it.

544
00:52:55,965 --> 00:52:59,320
We will have zkoupit
Bribery and one stewardess.

545
00:52:59,462 --> 00:53:01,159
I bought airline.

546
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:04,357
It seemed easier.

547
00:53:06,376 --> 00:53:08,015
It seems that we won
his ten hours.

548
00:53:09,736 --> 00:53:12,686
Ariadne, excellent work,
incidentally.

549
00:54:04,247 --> 00:54:06,070
You know what to do.

550
00:54:09,454 --> 00:54:12,520
Remember when you me
asked for her hand?

551
00:54:13,729 --> 00:54:15,524
Absolutely.

552
00:54:16,988 --> 00:54:20,225
You say you dream about it ...

553
00:54:21,885 --> 00:54:26,139
How to grow old together.

554
00:54:26,422 --> 00:54:27,776
Still, we can.

555
00:54:34,508 --> 00:54:36,076
Here you should not be.

556
00:54:40,526 --> 00:54:43,937
I wanted to see what the
"Tests" in the night doing.

557
00:54:43,972 --> 00:54:48,979
--This has nothing to do.
--Sure you do. We share your dreams with you.

558
00:54:49,014 --> 00:54:52,894
These sun
These are my dreams.

559
00:55:04,488 --> 00:55:06,155
Why are you doing?

560
00:55:06,688 --> 00:55:08,933
It's the only way
I can still dream.

561
00:55:11,163 --> 00:55:13,246
Why is
both of you?

562
00:55:14,033 --> 00:55:16,750
In dreams, we're always together.

563
00:55:31,065 --> 00:55:32,519
These are not just dreams.

564
00:55:34,949 --> 00:55:37,503
These are the memories. You said
should not be used.

565
00:55:37,538 --> 00:55:39,057
I know.

566
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:41,384
Trying to keep her alive.

567
00:55:42,175 --> 00:55:43,707
Do not let her go.

568
00:55:44,073 --> 00:55:45,757
You do not understand.

569
00:55:46,101 --> 00:55:49,793
These are the memories,
I have to change.

570
00:55:51,551 --> 00:55:53,205
What is hidden below?

571
00:55:53,721 --> 00:55:57,297
There is one thing
for me, you understand.

572
00:56:05,535 --> 00:56:07,362
Your house?

573
00:56:05,535 --> 00:56:07,362
Your house?

574
00:56:10,337 --> 00:56:12,178
Where is he?

575
00:56:13,032 --> 00:56:14,774
More.

576
00:56:20,118 --> 00:56:23,931
This is my son, James.
Something dug. On earthworms.

577
00:56:25,648 --> 00:56:31,957
This is Phillip. I would call them,
I last saw them ...

578
00:56:33,268 --> 00:56:37,768
smile and beautiful
but it is too late.

579
00:56:38,524 --> 00:56:40,666
Now or never, Cobb.

580
00:56:45,297 --> 00:56:50,692
And then I started to panic.
I know I'll regret that moment,

581
00:56:51,383 --> 00:56:53,776
when I've last seen.

582
00:57:00,898 --> 00:57:03,396
Everything we do,
it will not change at this time.

583
00:57:05,186 --> 00:57:07,229
They called it ...

584
00:57:08,318 --> 00:57:09,678
and they are gone.

585
00:57:12,155 --> 00:57:15,265
If I get home
And never see.

586
00:57:16,130 --> 00:57:17,108
In the real world.

587
00:57:59,098 --> 00:58:00,694
What are you doing here?

588
00:58:01,810 --> 00:58:03,890
--I ...
"I know who you are.

589
00:58:04,435 --> 00:58:05,597
What are you doing here?

590
00:58:14,819 --> 00:58:16,790
I'm just trying to understand ...

591
00:58:17,202 --> 00:58:18,771
How could you understand?

592
00:58:20,267 --> 00:58:22,803
You know what being in love?

593
00:58:24,095 --> 00:58:27,401
Being half a whole?

594
00:58:27,793 --> 00:58:29,184
No.

595
00:58:30,267 --> 00:58:32,631
Let me tell you a riddle.

596
00:58:34,145 --> 00:58:36,396
Waiting for the train.

597
00:58:37,737 --> 00:58:40,143
Train that will take him now.

598
00:58:42,199 --> 00:58:47,951
I hope he will take you anywhere you want.
But you can be sure.

599
00:58:48,671 --> 00:58:50,435
But no matter.

600
00:58:51,836 --> 00:58:54,624
Why do you care,
where you can catch the train?

601
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:56,491
Because we'll be together.

602
00:58:58,032 --> 00:58:59,793
How did you get here
could bring, Don?

603
00:58:59,828 --> 00:59:00,965
What place is this?

604
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:04,446
Suite Hotel,
where we celebrated the birthday.

605
00:59:04,481 --> 00:59:05,792
What happened here?

606
00:59:07,722 --> 00:59:10,272
You promised!

607
00:59:10,888 --> 00:59:13,239
I just take it, I'll be back.

608
00:59:13,274 --> 00:59:16,752
You promised we'll be together!

609
00:59:16,787 --> 00:59:17,937
I will be back again.

610
00:59:17,972 --> 00:59:20,225
I promise.

611
00:59:37,555 --> 00:59:42,061
You think you can simply
stuck in their memories?

612
00:59:43,781 --> 00:59:45,981
Do you think it will live?

613
00:59:46,484 --> 00:59:50,877
Come on. Maurice Fischer
just died in Sydney.

614
00:59:51,653 --> 00:59:53,487
--When is the funeral?
--On Thursday.

615
00:59:53,522 --> 00:59:56,606
--Los Angeles.
Robert with a coffin--fly on Tuesday.

616
00:59:56,641 --> 00:59:57,991
--We have to hurry.
--Claro.

617
00:59:58,990 --> 01:00:00,543
I'll fly with you. "

618
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:02,683
I can not, I promised my father.

619
01:00:02,718 --> 01:00:05,709
You need someone there,
who understands their problems.

620
01:00:08,541 --> 01:00:14,209
And if not me, then you should
Arthur shows what I saw.

621
01:00:19,488 --> 01:00:21,625
Make another ticket.

622
01:00:25,983 --> 01:00:28,652
If you get on the plane
and you do not keep our agreement,

623
01:00:28,752 --> 01:00:32,160
After closing the landing to my life.

624
01:00:33,305 --> 01:00:40,621
Complete your task, I will call the aircraft,
and you will not have problems.

625
01:00:55,177 --> 01:00:55,942
Sorry.

626
01:00:55,977 --> 01:00:57,430
Yes, sorry.

627
01:01:32,897 --> 01:01:35,864
Sorry, but I think this is yours.
You had to leave.

628
01:01:35,899 --> 01:01:37,890
Want something to drink?

629
01:01:37,925 --> 01:01:39,017
Ice water, please.
"Me too.

630
01:01:44,771 --> 01:01:46,396
Thank you.

631
01:01:46,432 --> 01:01:51,440
Not coincidentally, the relationship
Maurice Fischer famous?

632
01:01:52,095 --> 01:01:55,898
Yes it is ...
It was my father.

633
01:01:56,399 --> 01:02:00,087
It was an inspiring man.
His loss I'm sorry.

634
01:02:03,508 --> 01:02:05,188
--Here.
--Thanks.

635
01:02:06,956 --> 01:02:09,149
For his father.

636
01:02:09,515 --> 01:02:11,163
Rip.

637
01:03:20,345 --> 01:03:22,270
Q: Could you pee before you fly?
--Sorry.

638
01:03:22,271 --> 01:03:25,888
Very champagne--free?
--Great fun.

639
01:03:26,059 --> 01:03:28,149
At least he will need a taxi.

640
01:03:40,666 --> 01:03:42,122
You're an idiot?

641
01:03:42,157 --> 01:03:44,215
Skirt.

642
01:04:01,821 --> 01:04:03,100
Gotta go. Taxi!

643
01:04:11,151 --> 01:04:13,284
--What do you do?
"I thought it was free.

644
01:04:11,151 --> 01:04:13,284
--What do you do?
"I thought it was free.

645
01:04:14,821 --> 01:04:16,826
Absolutely not. You ...

646
01:04:20,526 --> 01:04:21,430
Great.

647
01:04:26,819 --> 01:04:27,981
Come on.

648
01:04:39,295 --> 01:04:42,376
There is U.S. $ 500
portfolio is more expensive.

649
01:04:42,411 --> 01:04:44,175
Take me at least
where I wanted.

650
01:04:42,411 --> 01:04:44,175
Take me at least
where I wanted.

651
01:04:54,237 --> 01:04:55,692
Cover us!

652
01:05:58,761 --> 01:05:59,503
Stop it!

653
01:06:06,624 --> 01:06:07,666
Are you okay?

654
01:06:08,140 --> 01:06:12,909
Yes, I'm fine.
Fischer, too. He took comfort.

655
01:06:12,910 --> 01:06:14,003
Saito?

656
01:06:33,075 --> 01:06:34,513
Make it back!

657
01:06:38,596 --> 01:06:40,288
--Death? "
"I do not know.

658
01:06:42,404 --> 01:06:44,667
--Where were you?
He hit us trains.

659
01:06:44,716 --> 01:06:47,349
--What a train in the street?
"I have not given you there!

660
01:06:47,711 --> 01:06:50,444
Where there are married?
--Can you tell me what's going on?

661
01:06:50,479 --> 01:06:53,568
These were not normal
projections are training!

662
01:06:53,815 --> 01:06:54,858
As they have the training?

663
01:06:54,958 --> 01:06:59,337
Fischer learned Extractor
unconsciously avoid infestation.

664
01:06:59,338 --> 01:07:02,457
So they are armed.
I had to find out.

665
01:07:02,868 --> 01:07:04,820
--And why not?
--Peace.

666
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:09,187
Do not tell me to calm me.
It was your responsibility!

667
01:07:09,306 --> 01:07:11,706
Able to examine it
Fischer's past.

668
01:07:11,741 --> 01:07:13,747
We're not ready
for this event!

669
01:07:13,748 --> 01:07:17,300
Experience
'll be more careful!

670
01:07:17,319 --> 01:07:19,333
This was part of the plan.
He dies!

671
01:07:19,433 --> 01:07:21,874
"I'll spare you the pain.
--Do not shoot!

672
01:07:22,437 --> 01:07:23,388
No!

673
01:07:23,423 --> 01:07:25,548
He is in agony, only to wake him.

674
01:07:25,583 --> 01:07:28,093
No, wake up.

675
01:07:29,193 --> 01:07:31,697
When you die in a dream, wake up.

676
01:07:31,732 --> 01:07:35,123
Not this time. With this dose
Sedation me awake.

677
01:07:36,148 --> 01:07:37,889
What happens when we die here?

678
01:07:37,924 --> 01:07:39,112
You fall in the desert.

679
01:07:39,147 --> 01:07:40,650
--Are you serious?
The Waste Land?

680
01:07:40,651 --> 01:07:44,312
Raw desert dreams.
--And what?

681
01:07:44,313 --> 01:07:47,412
Only remnants of the subconscious
that's all there is.

682
01:07:47,612 --> 01:07:51,868
Remains unconscious man
there was only one of us.

683
01:07:52,399 --> 01:07:54,443
What is you.

684
01:07:54,807 --> 01:07:58,803
How long can we stay?
Not run--up to the sedatives --

685
01:07:58,903 --> 01:08:01,792
How long?
Decades, perhaps forever.

686
01:08:01,827 --> 01:08:03,288
He was there, ask him.

687
01:08:08,876 --> 01:08:09,938
Thanks.

688
01:08:10,296 --> 01:08:14,364
We're stuck in the mind of Fischer,
haunted by his army,

689
01:08:14,464 --> 01:08:18,745
and if they kill us, will remain in
Desert, until our brains neshnijou.

690
01:08:30,058 --> 01:08:31,992
You knew about the risk?

691
01:08:32,027 --> 01:08:34,029
--And all that tell us?
"There's nothing to threaten us.

692
01:08:34,064 --> 01:08:36,254
We did not have the
middle of a firefight.

693
01:08:36,289 --> 01:08:38,896
Nemels law.
--The only way to reach the third level.

694
01:08:39,410 --> 01:08:42,661
--And you know it.
"I believed him.

695
01:08:42,696 --> 01:08:44,823
Believe? How much you gave me,
half of you?

696
01:08:44,858 --> 01:08:46,937
No. I gave it everything.

697
01:08:47,121 --> 01:08:49,838
--He said he tried it.
Experienced? Who, with mal?

698
01:08:50,011 --> 01:08:54,135
This nevyvedlo--lot!
--I did it just because their children.

699
01:08:54,136 --> 01:08:56,019
You brought us through
war without an exit.

700
01:08:56,054 --> 01:08:58,829
This is a way to leave.
Let us conclude our work

701
01:08:58,842 --> 01:09:03,040
As he goes quickly and
We were expelled.

702
01:09:03,075 --> 01:09:06,951
Forget it. Can not go anywhere.
We kept odsedím here.

703
01:09:07,489 --> 01:09:12,648
Fischer guard around us.
At this level is 10 flight hours per week.

704
01:09:12,649 --> 01:09:16,706
We guarantee that
Here we all die.

705
01:09:17,239 --> 01:09:20,140
The only option is to continue
as soon as possible.

706
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:25,121
The fall is our only way.

707
01:09:26,062 --> 01:09:27,724
Prepare yourself.

708
01:09:27,885 --> 01:09:31,745
Let's try a little to deteriorate.

709
01:09:34,905 --> 01:09:39,134
I have insurance against kidnapping
10 million. Will it lightly.

710
01:09:39,135 --> 01:09:40,173
Shut up!

711
01:09:40,208 --> 01:09:44,558
In the office, his father
is a personal insurance.

712
01:09:44,593 --> 01:09:45,942
We want to know the combination.

713
01:09:46,466 --> 01:09:51,613
I do not know about the safe.
--That does not mean you do not know the code.

714
01:09:52,668 --> 01:09:54,156
Tell us.

715
01:09:55,172 --> 01:09:56,507
I know him.

716
01:10:01,651 --> 01:10:04,305
Source told us something more.

717
01:10:04,427 --> 01:10:06,768
What is this source?

718
01:10:07,924 --> 01:10:10,990
Worth $ 500.
--What's inside?

719
01:10:11,562 --> 01:10:14,882
Money, cards, cards.
And this.

720
01:10:20,568 --> 01:10:21,366
It will be for anything?

721
01:10:22,871 --> 01:10:26,274
Maybe. Your turn.
You have one hour.

722
01:10:26,309 --> 01:10:27,796
Time?

723
01:10:28,354 --> 01:10:30,806
I had to have all night.

724
01:10:30,841 --> 01:10:33,577
The Saito had
a bullet hole on his chest.

725
01:10:33,962 --> 01:10:36,333
You have one hour. Learn
useful, please.

726
01:10:39,156 --> 01:10:40,509
What?

727
01:10:41,004 --> 01:10:42,573
Our source.

728
01:10:46,358 --> 01:10:47,543
Uncle Peter.

729
01:10:49,001 --> 01:10:50,407
If you stop.

730
01:10:51,515 --> 01:10:53,656
Tu combination.
"I do not know.

731
01:10:51,515 --> 01:10:53,656
Tu combination.
"I do not know.

732
01:10:55,515 --> 01:10:58,868
I do not know. Let me
talk to him and I'll find out.

733
01:11:01,508 --> 01:11:02,713
You have one hour.

734
01:11:03,422 --> 01:11:04,075
So start talking.

735
01:11:08,830 --> 01:11:10,018
Are you okay?

736
01:11:14,276 --> 01:11:16,803
The bastards me
processed by two days.

737
01:11:18,633 --> 01:11:22,519
Get access to offices
his father and wants to open the safe.

738
01:11:23,505 --> 01:11:25,906
I thought the combination I know,
But this is not true.

739
01:11:25,941 --> 01:11:27,376
Furthermore, I know.

740
01:11:28,435 --> 01:11:29,331
What?

741
01:11:29,755 --> 01:11:33,442
Maurice told me that after he dies,
you just opened.

742
01:11:33,477 --> 01:11:35,443
He never told me
any combination.

743
01:11:36,284 --> 01:11:37,818
Maybe said ...

744
01:11:37,819 --> 01:11:39,390
I just know it's a combination.

745
01:11:40,894 --> 01:11:43,384
--So what?
I do not know, something that applies

746
01:11:43,419 --> 01:11:46,954
to their common experiences.

747
01:11:50,238 --> 01:11:54,094
We just have a lot of
common experiences.

748
01:11:55,100 --> 01:12:01,826
Perhaps, after his mother died.
"You know what I said then?

749
01:12:03,316 --> 01:12:08,401
"Robert, you have nothing to say."

750
01:12:09,392 --> 01:12:14,012
--He was upset by it.
"I was eleven!

751
01:12:14,744 --> 01:12:17,848
--How is he?
"My great pain.

752
01:12:17,948 --> 01:12:22,909
Elsewhere, it will improve.
And if you die?

753
01:12:24,150 --> 01:12:28,135
In the worst case
wakes up with an empty brain.

754
01:12:28,614 --> 01:12:32,578
Cobb, will keep our agreement.

755
01:12:32,891 --> 01:12:38,266
I appreciate that but after waking
not even need to know that some were.

756
01:12:38,903 --> 01:12:40,951
The forest becomes your reality.

757
01:12:41,013 --> 01:12:45,060
Will you be there so long,
she gets older.

758
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:57,314
complete remorse.

759
01:13:04,132 --> 01:13:07,972
--They will kill us because of that.
Only one of us wants to --

760
01:13:08,007 --> 01:13:12,680
I heard that we
sheds in the car in a river.

761
01:13:13,472 --> 01:13:17,063
--What is safe?
--Something for you.

762
01:13:17,619 --> 01:13:21,542
Maurice has always said
is a precious gift for you.

763
01:13:22,556 --> 01:13:23,466
Testament.

764
01:13:23,911 --> 01:13:32,472
Maurice is a lawyer.
--It removes it. Divide into small businesses.

765
01:13:32,572 --> 01:13:35,613
That would be the end
our whole empire.

766
01:13:36,316 --> 01:13:41,893
Destroy my inheritance?
Why would something like this?

767
01:13:46,513 --> 01:13:48,004
He loved you, Robert.

768
01:13:49,138 --> 01:13:52,210
--As a special ...
--In a special mode.

769
01:13:54,037 --> 01:13:58,375
In the end he called me.

770
01:13:59,659 --> 01:14:05,969
Barely spoke. But he gave
effort to tell me one last thing.

771
01:14:08,857 --> 01:14:18,022
I leaned over and detected
I have only one word ...

772
01:14:21,342 --> 01:14:23,859
"Disappointed."

773
01:14:28,931 --> 01:14:33,339
What awaits us in the desert?
You can convince the rest of the team,

774
01:14:33,439 --> 01:14:36,527
but they do not know the whole truth.

775
01:14:36,710 --> 01:14:42,050
--What truth?
--Mind your can summon the train.

776
01:14:42,250 --> 01:14:46,368
Barely surviving
in his subconscious.

777
01:14:46,424 --> 01:14:50,703
And that, to deepen their
Fischer, who go deep inside you.

778
01:14:52,484 --> 01:14:54,707
And maybe we do not like,
what they think.

779
01:14:59,043 --> 01:15:09,461
We work together
Research on the dream of a dream.

780
01:15:10,120 --> 01:15:14,984
But we did not know
time there fluently much more slowly.

781
01:15:15,564 --> 01:15:24,798
When you're long in the subconscious
forget what is real.

782
01:15:15,564 --> 01:15:24,798
When you're long in the subconscious
forget what is real.

783
01:15:35,556 --> 01:15:39,954
It took years,
but we build it.

784
01:15:42,018 --> 01:15:46,842
How long were you there?
--About fifty years.

785
01:15:50,278 --> 01:15:51,455
Jeez.

786
01:15:53,537 --> 01:15:55,346
How did you do that?

787
01:15:55,359 --> 01:15:59,120
The first years were not
as bad as if he were God.

788
01:15:59,220 --> 01:16:04,997
But it was not fair.
I could not live like this.

789
01:16:05,948 --> 01:16:14,068
--And what happened to her?
--Something hidden inside.

790
01:16:15,985 --> 01:16:20,955
Law, who requested anonymity.
She wanted to forget it.

791
01:16:24,073 --> 01:16:26,389
Wasteland has become a reality.

792
01:16:28,269 --> 01:16:29,784
What happened when you woke up?

793
01:16:30,633 --> 01:16:38,974
After so many decades, when he wakes up
old souls in young bodies ...

794
01:16:40,615 --> 01:16:43,938
I've seen is something.
She would not admit it.

795
01:16:45,730 --> 01:16:51,340
She was enthusiastic about the idea.

796
01:16:51,895 --> 01:16:56,759
This simple
I thought everything had changed.

797
01:16:58,604 --> 01:17:05,798
Believe that reality is not true,
they should wake up again.

798
01:17:07,145 --> 01:17:11,912
To be able to return home
must be killed.

799
01:17:19,130 --> 01:17:22,819
--What are your children?
"I thought we were designing.

800
01:17:22,930 --> 01:17:25,730
This right for our children
We're waiting somewhere.

801
01:17:25,830 --> 01:17:29,284
I'm your mother, you know the difference!

802
01:17:29,319 --> 01:17:33,458
--When is a dream, why did not he speak?
--Because you know what you eat!

803
01:17:33,820 --> 01:17:39,541
It was clear that there is nothing
do it no matter how they try.

804
01:17:42,635 --> 01:17:47,482
Failed to kill,
she loved me too.

805
01:17:48,453 --> 01:17:51,669
Developed a plan for our anniversary.

806
01:18:18,509 --> 01:18:20,765
--Darling what are you doing?
Join me.

807
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:25,825
Go back inside.
Yeah? Back.

808
01:18:25,860 --> 01:18:26,337
No.

809
01:18:27,648 --> 01:18:29,937
And you jump with me.

810
01:18:30,387 --> 01:18:33,669
No, I'm not falling.
Listen to me.

811
01:18:34,911 --> 01:18:42,973
When I jump, wake up.
Die, then go back inside.

812
01:18:43,073 --> 01:18:45,416
talk--Let 's.
--We've talked a lot.

813
01:18:49,368 --> 01:18:51,985
Go to the edge
or go straight.

814
01:18:57,297 --> 01:19:03,958
talk--Let 's.
--I ask you to go with me.

815
01:19:07,098 --> 01:19:10,066
I can not, you know it.

816
01:19:10,483 --> 01:19:16,786
Think of our children.
For James, Phillip.

817
01:19:17,512 --> 01:19:20,379
When neskocíš,
as they will not.

818
01:19:21,110 --> 01:19:24,302
--What do you mean?
"I left a letter with a lawyer.

819
01:19:24,402 --> 01:19:27,178
I write it as
I fear for my safety.

820
01:19:30,209 --> 01:19:31,985
How can you threaten death.

821
01:19:34,844 --> 01:19:37,262
--Why did you do?
"I love you, Dom

822
01:19:37,983 --> 01:19:42,334
--Why did you ...?
--So I got rid of guilt.

823
01:19:42,685 --> 01:19:45,578
You could go back home to
our children real.

824
01:19:46,069 --> 01:19:50,993
--Mal, listen. Look at me.
--Waiting for a train ...

825
01:19:51,028 --> 01:19:55,239
--Damn it, stop it!
--Train, which will take you far.

826
01:19:51,028 --> 01:19:55,239
--Damn it, stop it!
--Train, which will take you far.

827
01:20:00,052 --> 01:20:03,740
--Damn, look at me!
"But no matter.

828
01:20:05,188 --> 01:20:07,384
Because we'll be together.

829
01:20:10,091 --> 01:20:12,804
None Christ Jesus!

830
01:20:16,106 --> 01:20:19,900
She had three psychiatrists
confirm that it is healthy.

831
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:24,010
I could not tell them,
what comes from his madness.

832
01:20:24,476 --> 01:20:30,234
--I flew ...
--Now or never, Cobb.

833
01:20:42,639 --> 01:20:46,189
I left there and the kids
had to start somewhere else.

834
01:20:46,830 --> 01:20:53,943
The thought set.
Unable to what happened.

835
01:20:55,386 --> 01:21:02,487
If we succeed here,
You have to forgive and deal with it.

836
01:21:03,515 --> 01:21:05,826
"You have to do it.
No..

837
01:21:05,861 --> 01:21:13,032
And for others, why not
no idea how you have to take risks.

838
01:21:18,249 --> 01:21:20,748
--We have to hurry.
--Time ".

839
01:21:21,380 --> 01:21:27,194
Look, I know
any combination. Not consciously.

840
01:21:27,838 --> 01:21:31,843
Now someone
is prepared in the vault.

841
01:21:31,943 --> 01:21:34,745
Tell him that the first six
numbers, what you think.

842
01:21:34,746 --> 01:21:36,827
"I do not know.
--Come on!

843
01:21:36,916 --> 01:21:38,664
I said come on!

844
01:21:39,028 --> 01:21:43,210
.. 5th 2 .. 8 .. 491

845
01:21:47,834 --> 01:21:51,200
"You'll have to try harder.
Pick--up.

846
01:21:57,472 --> 01:22:00,906
We increased the price of life.
Can you hear me?

847
01:22:07,060 --> 01:22:11,415
--So? --His relationship with his father
is worse than we thought.

848
01:22:11,515 --> 01:22:14,856
--Go to help?
This greater catharsis.

849
01:22:17,087 --> 01:22:23,198
--What is with them?
--Working on it. --Click Add.

850
01:22:24,012 --> 01:22:26,446
We need to get there.

851
01:23:03,746 --> 01:23:05,590
Do not be afraid to dream big, baby.

852
01:23:23,495 --> 01:23:28,018
--We have to turn them against the Godfather.
Destroy the only functional relationship?

853
01:23:28,380 --> 01:23:32,879
Nah, we find the godfather
and atonement with the father.

854
01:23:33,338 --> 01:23:35,364
Indeed we must Fischer
pay more than Saito.

855
01:23:36,605 --> 01:23:40,604
As you walk down, it gets worse.
"Maybe it's time for Mr. Charles.

856
01:23:42,042 --> 01:23:43,534
"Who is Mr. Charles?
--Bad idea.

857
01:23:43,569 --> 01:23:47,632
When we got to the hotel
Fischer keeps attacking us.

858
01:23:47,732 --> 01:23:50,540
Used as Charles Stein.
So, have you tried this?

859
01:23:50,640 --> 01:23:55,251
Yes, and it did not work. Body
realized he was sleeping and destroy us.

860
01:23:55,351 --> 01:23:56,689
Well it will be fun!

861
01:23:57,491 --> 01:24:01,753
--We need a distraction.
--Use again the lovely lady.

862
01:24:02,215 --> 01:24:06,155
Listen, be careful. Downstairs
It will be terrible to play with us.

863
01:24:11,107 --> 01:24:14,952
We care
Synchronize the kick.

864
01:24:15,060 --> 01:24:17,513
I go to the music in time
the rest is up to you.

865
01:24:18,391 --> 01:24:19,706
--Are you ready?
--Can!

866
01:24:21,521 --> 01:24:22,781
Sweet dreams.

867
01:24:23,297 --> 01:24:29,300
I'm boring you? I told you
its history, but you probably do not care.

868
01:24:31,197 --> 01:24:34,472
I am now in my head.

869
01:24:35,367 --> 01:24:37,142
Here comes Mr. Charles.

870
01:24:41,752 --> 01:24:43,991
Mr. Fischer, right?

871
01:24:44,729 --> 01:24:47,361
Glad to see you again.
Rob Green marketing.

872
01:24:49,328 --> 01:24:51,604
--And you?
On--leave.

873
01:24:55,606 --> 01:24:57,507
If you got bored with.

874
01:25:01,744 --> 01:25:06,146
Vypekla you or have your
only six phone numbers?

875
01:25:08,212 --> 01:25:12,126
In addition, she stole his wallet.

876
01:25:16,698 --> 01:25:19,608
--Hell happened ...
$ --500?

877
01:25:19,609 --> 01:25:23,055
Do not worry
My people came after it.

878
01:25:23,418 --> 01:25:25,460
Who or what is Mr. Charles?

879
01:25:25,560 --> 01:25:28,794
Way to navigate Fischer
against his own subconscious.

880
01:25:29,325 --> 01:25:32,806
--How does he do?
Body say, that dream.

881
01:25:32,906 --> 01:25:35,218
What can summon a lot of
unwanted attention.

882
01:25:35,636 --> 01:25:42,283
Cobb did not want, right?
--At least you see how often violates the rules.

883
01:25:45,255 --> 01:25:47,961
--Mr Saito, I can stop it?
Excuse me, but ...

884
01:25:50,476 --> 01:25:53,618
"You're alive.
--Very funny, Mr Eames.

885
01:26:00,438 --> 01:26:05,355
Turbulence in plane?
No, it was close. Auto.

886
01:26:14,420 --> 01:26:18,004
--How do you say your name?
--Rob Green marketing.

887
01:26:19,175 --> 01:26:20,735
But this is obviously not true.

888
01:26:22,587 --> 01:26:25,809
Mr. Charles
remember me?

889
01:26:26,472 --> 01:26:28,561
I have to worry about security.

890
01:26:29,275 --> 01:26:34,245
Get off at different floors.
Reject the portfolio, looking for her.

891
01:26:35,537 --> 01:26:37,487
We need more time to ensure Cobb.

892
01:26:41,383 --> 01:26:46,331
Security, yes?
You work for a hotel?

893
01:26:46,431 --> 01:26:51,129
No, I read with great
specific type of security.

894
01:26:52,694 --> 01:26:55,670
Security awareness.
--You talk about dreams?

895
01:26:57,130 --> 01:27:02,527
The extraction?
"I'm here to protect you.

896
01:27:15,705 --> 01:27:21,283
I'm here to protect you
accidental infections of your mind.

897
01:27:21,748 --> 01:27:23,627
You're safe here.

898
01:27:25,293 --> 01:27:26,761
They go for you.

899
01:27:45,136 --> 01:27:46,871
special time, eh?

900
01:27:52,151 --> 01:27:53,211
Can you feel it?

901
01:27:55,295 --> 01:27:59,587
--What is happening?
Cobb--Fischer said only that dream.

902
01:27:59,588 --> 01:28:05,435
Subconscious now looking for a sleeper.
Then me. Quickly, kiss me.

903
01:28:10,684 --> 01:28:14,467
Still, watching.
The attempt of the cost that.

904
01:28:15,496 --> 01:28:17,289
We must go.

905
01:28:32,975 --> 01:28:36,492
Can you feel it? This is what you
was committed, Mr. Fisher.

906
01:28:36,592 --> 01:28:40,469
Feel time zláštnost
changes in gravity.

907
01:28:41,007 --> 01:28:44,216
Nothing out this is not true.
You're in a dream.

908
01:28:48,720 --> 01:28:54,271
The best you can when you
Remember how you came to the hotel.

909
01:28:56,018 --> 01:28:59,927
Well, I ...
--Breathe, remember the training.

910
01:29:03,295 --> 01:29:05,083
You will find that you're in a dream
and I'll protect you.

911
01:29:11,484 --> 01:29:13,571
--Not true?
"I'm not.

912
01:29:14,707 --> 01:29:21,720
Protect your subconscious
extracting attack.

913
01:29:22,265 --> 01:29:25,297
And it is now
happening, Mr. Fisher.

914
01:29:33,977 --> 01:29:37,732
"You can go out?
Follow me.

915
01:29:59,850 --> 01:30:01,463
What are you doing?

916
01:30:01,783 --> 01:30:06,342
Did you take. If you want
help you to calm down.

917
01:30:08,913 --> 01:30:11,183
I need your cooperation.

918
01:30:22,830 --> 01:30:28,559
--If you dream that I wake up, right?
"I would not, Mr. Fisher.

919
01:30:28,594 --> 01:30:33,316
Surely you have given sedatives.
You do not wake up.

920
01:30:34,736 --> 01:30:39,096
You were in my dreams.
You know what I mean ...

921
01:30:41,111 --> 01:30:47,306
Remember the training,
what I said?

922
01:30:59,257 --> 01:31:01,837
--This room is directly below 528?
--Yes.

923
01:31:11,394 --> 01:31:15,969
Think about what you
Down you remember the dream?

924
01:31:17,253 --> 01:31:21,925
Lots of shooting ...
It rained.

925
01:31:22,937 --> 01:31:24,226
Uncle Peter!

926
01:31:25,425 --> 01:31:27,751
Kidnapped us.
--Where did you accomplish?

927
01:31:31,622 --> 01:31:34,810
Led us in the van.
--This explains the changes in gravity.

928
01:31:34,910 --> 01:31:36,888
Now you're in the van.
Let us remember more.

929
01:31:37,633 --> 01:31:45,282
Somehow, he was associated with a safe.
I do not remember.

930
01:31:45,382 --> 01:31:50,140
Like remembering a dream
Awakening, he wants to years of practice.

931
01:31:50,468 --> 01:31:55,365
Browning and you sleep because
You want to steal something from your head.

932
01:31:55,465 --> 01:31:58,766
I need you
concentrate and remember what it is.

933
01:31:59,627 --> 01:32:02,334
--What is it, Mr. Fisher?
--Combination!

934
01:32:02,910 --> 01:32:05,511
They wanted to know the top six
numbers, which makes me wonder.

935
01:32:05,546 --> 01:32:07,996
Trying to extract numbers
from your subconscious.

936
01:32:07,997 --> 01:32:10,880
They could say anything.
Now we're in a hotel ...

937
01:32:13,035 --> 01:32:16,927
Let's try the room number.
How was that number?

938
01:32:17,027 --> 01:32:18,967
Try to remember
It is very important.

939
01:32:19,031 --> 01:32:25,449
--5 ... 2 .. It was a long number.
--Enough for now.

940
01:32:25,673 --> 01:32:26,887
Fifth floor.
Roger.

941
01:32:27,335 --> 01:32:31,102
--You can use a timer?
No, the trigger alone.

942
01:32:31,664 --> 01:32:35,111
When you sleep at 528
I'll give you a kick.

943
01:32:35,211 --> 01:32:37,494
--How do you know when?
--Highlights of my music.

944
01:32:37,495 --> 01:32:40,929
When a car breaks down barriers
on the bridge, I can not make a mistake.

945
01:32:41,203 --> 01:32:44,124
We need a good
synchronized kicking.

946
01:32:44,658 --> 01:32:50,417
Very early he kicks us
late again down.

947
01:32:50,576 --> 01:32:53,714
Why?
Because auto--flight in freefall.

948
01:32:55,189 --> 01:32:57,748
Gravity does not kick.
--Claro.

949
01:33:02,995 --> 01:33:04,685
These are my people.

950
01:33:30,294 --> 01:33:33,081
Charles Sir!
--Do you recognize this, Mr. Fisher?

951
01:33:34,110 --> 01:33:37,917
--Did you sleep.
After all, we are in a dream.

952
01:33:38,017 --> 01:33:41,284
Again.
--Do you dream in a dream?

953
01:33:43,352 --> 01:33:45,636
"You've changed.
--What?

954
01:33:45,671 --> 01:33:51,040
Sorry, I confuse you.

955
01:33:52,717 --> 01:33:54,470
Surely with a piece?

956
01:33:57,109 --> 01:33:58,641
This is Fischer
projection of Browning.

957
01:33:58,741 --> 01:34:00,251
Their behavior may know
if she ever suspected.

958
01:34:00,331 --> 01:34:05,678
Why? Why We Fischer
instructed to take it as an obstacle.

959
01:34:11,871 --> 01:34:14,100
--Peter?
"You said it kidnapped along?

960
01:34:14,135 --> 01:34:19,182
--He had two days, tortured him.
"You saw that torture?

961
01:34:27,178 --> 01:34:30,581
You're the kidnapper sent?
--Robert ...

962
01:34:31,533 --> 01:34:35,134
You tried to open the safe,
will have a big?

963
01:34:35,734 --> 01:34:39,766
I gave all of us
your life. I will not let you destroy it.

964
01:34:39,801 --> 01:34:42,136
I do not want to destroy their heritage,
Why would I do?

965
01:34:42,546 --> 01:34:46,524
I could not let it
succumbing to the last race of his father.

966
01:34:47,445 --> 01:34:52,255
--Trick?
--This will be his last crime.

967
01:34:52,256 --> 01:35:00,284
Says you're worthy of his legacy,
you wanted to build something yourself.

968
01:36:34,363 --> 01:36:35,393
Cobb?

969
01:36:37,982 --> 01:36:38,959
What's down there?

970
01:36:37,982 --> 01:36:38,959
What's down there?

971
01:36:44,827 --> 01:36:47,037
I mean, what's wrong with you?

972
01:39:23,277 --> 01:39:24,914
Have you seen this? "

973
01:39:44,184 --> 01:39:48,334
Eames, his dream, to have
attention to safety.

974
01:39:48,434 --> 01:39:50,528
Zašplhá--Who?
--I do not.

975
01:39:50,769 --> 01:39:55,143
We have to divide.
--I do not propose here.

976
01:39:55,243 --> 01:39:57,335
"You're with me.
--I mastered it.

977
01:39:58,273 --> 01:40:02,599
Reaching the top of the building.
Fisher, you go with it.

978
01:40:05,365 --> 01:40:07,918
Leave it on, I
all the time to listen.

979
01:40:08,338 --> 01:40:11,987
Windows are on top big enough
I'll be able to cover the south tower.

980
01:40:12,719 --> 01:40:14,374
Are you going there?
No..

981
01:40:14,474 --> 01:40:18,356
To discover the truth about his father
Browning it means to you.

982
01:40:20,009 --> 01:40:21,380
Come on Fisher.

983
01:41:16,957 --> 01:41:18,126
Start the Clock!

984
01:41:52,366 --> 01:41:53,539
Hope you're ready.

985
01:42:02,648 --> 01:42:04,138
It's still early.

986
01:42:10,990 --> 01:42:14,409
Cobb, hear it? Noticed
It was twenty minutes ago.

987
01:42:14,509 --> 01:42:18,703
"I thought it was a breeze.
"I hear it, is music.

988
01:42:18,803 --> 01:42:21,860
--What do we do?
Hurry.

989
01:42:27,387 --> 01:42:29,089
You have ten seconds to jump.

990
01:42:31,398 --> 01:42:33,428
So Arthur has three minutes.

991
01:42:37,474 --> 01:42:39,244
--Who are we?
Sixty minutes.

992
01:42:39,344 --> 01:42:42,638
--I have it in an hour?
It should be across the courtyard.

993
01:42:42,738 --> 01:42:44,915
So they need a shortcut.

994
01:42:56,989 --> 01:43:00,976
--It is a maze.
We entered the hall.

995
01:43:26,157 --> 01:43:28,463
Eames Altered something?
I do not know if I can say that.

996
01:43:28,498 --> 01:43:30,934
--There could be hardly appear.
--No time! Has anything changed?

997
01:43:32,154 --> 01:43:35,749
Added fan under the main hall.
--Ok, explain it to them.

998
01:44:10,858 --> 01:44:11,890
Paradox.

999
01:45:22,195 --> 01:45:24,110
--What?
--Kopanec.

1000
01:45:24,809 --> 01:45:27,742
--Cobb, we lose it?
--Served.

1001
01:45:28,885 --> 01:45:33,261
Would not it be better to have a dream about a beach?

1002
01:45:36,912 --> 01:45:40,667
--What do we do now?
--Finish this before the next kick.

1003
01:45:40,967 --> 01:45:43,009
--That will be when?
--When the car crashes into the water.

1004
01:46:11,406 --> 01:46:13,926
As you kick without gravity?

1005
01:46:17,251 --> 01:46:19,818
Arthur has a couple of minutes,
we are about twenty.

1006
01:46:43,098 --> 01:46:44,335
Are you okay?

1007
01:46:57,522 --> 01:46:59,693
Something's wrong,
as if they knew anything about.

1008
01:47:02,282 --> 01:47:04,733
In little time to fix it, yes?

1009
01:48:46,907 --> 01:48:48,530
Before us is secure?

1010
01:48:48,565 --> 01:48:52,282
What should secure window?
--Not too hard.

1011
01:48:52,613 --> 01:48:54,521
Inside, he finds Fischer.

1012
01:48:56,961 --> 01:49:00,018
--This is the projection of your subconscious?
--Yes.

1013
01:49:00,053 --> 01:49:03,232
--Nenicíš your mind?
--There are only projections.

1014
01:49:30,721 --> 01:49:33,362
Near us, the entire army.

1015
01:49:59,964 --> 01:50:01,430
I'm here.

1016
01:50:50,527 --> 01:50:53,240
--Someone is there.
Fischer is a trap!

1017
01:50:55,418 --> 01:50:57,127
A little down.

1018
01:51:04,645 --> 01:51:06,847
Cobb, no she is not real!

1019
01:51:07,675 --> 01:51:10,123
--How do you know? "
--It 'projections!

1020
01:51:10,709 --> 01:51:12,904
Fischer is real!

1021
01:51:24,287 --> 01:51:26,436
Eames, immediately to the safe
Barely got here!

1022
01:52:09,904 --> 01:52:12,243
--What happened?
Mal--killed Fisher.

1023
01:52:15,194 --> 01:52:16,194
Nice shot.

1024
01:52:17,983 --> 01:52:20,957
It makes sense to revive him
his mind is already in the desert.

1025
01:52:21,383 --> 01:52:22,918
It's over.

1026
01:52:24,157 --> 01:52:27,204
--This is the whole, no?
It is, after all.

1027
01:52:27,886 --> 01:52:29,188
Sorry.

1028
01:52:32,378 --> 01:52:35,375
Well, you are not the only ones
see the family, right?

1029
01:52:36,036 --> 01:52:39,133
Too bad it did not open.
I would like to see what's there.

1030
01:52:39,969 --> 01:52:41,409
Prepare specifications.

1031
01:52:43,880 --> 01:52:47,864
There is also an option.
Just as we have nowhere to Fischer.

1032
01:52:47,899 --> 01:52:49,589
We do not have time.

1033
01:52:49,941 --> 01:52:51,885
No, there is no time to spare.

1034
01:52:53,835 --> 01:52:59,550
And when we meet and listen to music,
give him a kick electroshock.

1035
01:52:59,650 --> 01:53:03,091
We'll make it there.

1036
01:53:03,415 --> 01:53:07,910
We stayed there and listen
music tee hospital, all

1037
01:53:08,010 --> 01:53:10,359
and it wakes us all.

1038
01:53:12,160 --> 01:53:16,404
Worth a try.
But Saito is keeping guard.

1039
01:53:17,185 --> 01:53:21,966
Saito dies.
--Cobb, we have to try.

1040
01:53:23,739 --> 01:53:26,862
But if the return
before the kick, I'm done with you.

1041
01:53:26,962 --> 01:53:28,988
He's right, he can go.

1042
01:53:34,664 --> 01:53:38,832
"You can do this? mal will be there.
"I know where I can find it.

1043
01:53:39,594 --> 01:53:44,242
Fischer will be with her. Will want
I came here for him.

1044
01:53:44,493 --> 01:53:46,928
He wants me there with him.

1045
01:54:14,073 --> 01:54:14,995
Are you okay?

1046
01:54:22,149 --> 01:54:24,758
, This is your world?
--It.

1047
01:54:25,572 --> 01:54:27,261
Their waste.

1048
01:55:17,504 --> 01:55:23,408
Saito, I need to keep
guards prepare the charges.

1049
01:55:23,508 --> 01:55:26,209
Now I have a good proposal.

1050
01:55:29,174 --> 01:55:30,253
Neblbnete.

1051
01:56:03,240 --> 01:56:05,279
Everything you build?
That's incredible.

1052
01:56:05,742 --> 01:56:06,948
We had to years.

1053
01:56:08,630 --> 01:56:10,969
I started with memories.

1054
01:56:17,605 --> 01:56:18,720
This way.

1055
01:57:00,578 --> 01:57:04,603
This is our neighborhood.
Places in the past.

1056
01:57:05,263 --> 01:57:06,579
Our first apartment.

1057
01:57:07,483 --> 01:57:10,669
Until then, the building next door
Then he moved.

1058
01:57:10,769 --> 01:57:12,386
When Mal pregnant
We live here.

1059
01:57:12,408 --> 01:57:14,666
All you have to build
just the memories?

1060
01:57:14,701 --> 01:57:17,299
I said
We had a lot of time.

1061
01:57:17,977 --> 01:57:22,078
--What is it?
--The house of my childhood.

1062
01:57:22,890 --> 01:57:25,998
--Will there?
No..

1063
01:57:27,008 --> 01:57:30,171
We always wanted to live in a house
we love skyscrapers.

1064
01:57:30,271 --> 01:57:32,846
Here we have both.

1065
01:58:13,831 --> 01:58:18,332
Fisher--Getting back?
--We need to find some kick.

1066
01:58:18,667 --> 01:58:19,728
Maybe?

1067
01:58:22,655 --> 01:58:27,136
Listen, something you should know about me.
Inspiration ...

1068
01:58:40,139 --> 01:58:43,068
The idea is like a virus.
Parasite.

1069
01:58:44,740 --> 01:58:49,865
Highly contagious.
Grow from small seeds.

1070
01:58:51,024 --> 01:58:54,852
Or you define, or destroy.

1071
01:58:58,704 --> 01:59:03,583
Even the slightest idea how
"The world is not real"

1072
01:59:04,571 --> 01:59:07,648
can change everything.

1073
01:59:09,684 --> 01:59:15,589
You're so sure of your world.
Do you think this is true?

1074
01:59:17,922 --> 01:59:19,857
Or is it also
lost, as I was?

1075
01:59:21,796 --> 01:59:23,470
I do not know what is real.

1076
01:59:25,471 --> 01:59:27,474
You have terrible doubts?

1077
01:59:28,599 --> 01:59:31,155
Not feeling the victim, Don?

1078
01:59:31,593 --> 01:59:35,340
You're running around the world
Anonymous corporations?

1079
01:59:35,767 --> 01:59:38,349
Like when the projection
pursuit of a bed, right?

1080
01:59:40,255 --> 01:59:45,202
Admit it.
No longer believe in reality.

1081
01:59:45,826 --> 01:59:51,149
So now you choose.
Stay and pick me up.

1082
02:00:18,104 --> 02:00:21,954
You know I gotta go back
for children, which you left.

1083
02:00:23,037 --> 02:00:25,497
--Since you left us.
"You're wrong!

1084
02:00:26,088 --> 02:00:28,171
"I'm not mistaken.
"You're confused.

1085
02:00:29,747 --> 02:00:35,180
Our children are here. And you
I saw your face again.

1086
02:00:36,122 --> 02:00:38,917
Yes, but see
As in the real world.

1087
02:00:52,787 --> 02:00:57,103
You're mistaken.
Hear what you say.

1088
02:00:57,138 --> 02:01:00,691
These are our children.
Look.

1089
02:01:01,692 --> 02:01:06,487
--James, Phillip?
--Stop, they are not our children.

1090
02:01:06,522 --> 02:01:08,771
Repeating,
because you believed.

1091
02:01:08,806 --> 02:01:10,844
No, I know!
--And if you're wrong?

1092
02:01:10,879 --> 02:01:13,560
And if I'm real?

1093
02:01:14,664 --> 02:01:20,100
Repeat what you know
But what do you believe?

1094
02:01:21,531 --> 02:01:23,215
What do you think? "

1095
02:01:24,930 --> 02:01:26,307
Guilt.

1096
02:01:27,416 --> 02:01:29,212
I feel guilty, Mal

1097
02:01:30,548 --> 02:01:34,748
No matter what I do,
or how I'm desperate,

1098
02:01:34,848 --> 02:01:39,062
I am confused as ...
That the fault is still there.

1099
02:01:39,162 --> 02:01:42,887
--Reminds me of the truth.
--What truth?

1100
02:01:45,863 --> 02:01:50,262
That the idea of challenging
Indeed, I vnuknul.

1101
02:01:54,259 --> 02:01:56,963
You planted the idea
in my mind?

1102
02:01:58,832 --> 02:02:00,601
What are you talking about?

1103
02:02:01,392 --> 02:02:07,419
I know that inspiration can
because I have already done.

1104
02:02:07,716 --> 02:02:10,631
--My wife.
Why?

1105
02:02:11,548 --> 02:02:15,623
We're lost in the desert.
We needed to escape.

1106
02:02:16,313 --> 02:02:18,276
But she did not agree.

1107
02:02:21,630 --> 02:02:26,658
Something hidden.
Somewhere inside of me.

1108
02:02:28,181 --> 02:02:31,699
True, who requested anonymity.
They wanted to forget.

1109
02:02:33,187 --> 02:02:35,130
Could not free himself.

1110
02:02:38,036 --> 02:02:46,422
And so I started searching.
Ultimately, I find this hidden place.

1111
02:02:47,084 --> 02:02:50,653
Robbed there
and planted the idea.

1112
02:02:51,683 --> 02:02:55,843
A simple idea
everything changed.

1113
02:03:00,719 --> 02:03:03,332
That our world is not real.

1114
02:03:15,988 --> 02:03:18,972
And death is the only way out.

1115
02:03:26,359 --> 02:03:28,006
Waiting for the train.

1116
02:03:30,579 --> 02:03:32,866
On the train that will take you far.

1117
02:03:34,477 --> 02:03:37,120
You expect that will take you anywhere you want.

1118
02:03:38,574 --> 02:03:40,903
Can not be sure.

1119
02:03:41,905 --> 02:03:46,014
But it does not matter.
Tell me why!

1120
02:03:46,101 --> 02:03:48,082
Because we'll be together!

1121
02:03:52,271 --> 02:03:58,086
I should have known that
the idea will grow even more.

1122
02:04:01,724 --> 02:04:04,767
When she returned to reality ...

1123
02:04:07,164 --> 02:04:09,810
Also believed that the world is not real.

1124
02:04:12,877 --> 02:04:15,357
And death is the only way out.

1125
02:04:15,358 --> 02:04:18,339
Mai, Jesus Christ!

1126
02:04:18,974 --> 02:04:21,936
You infected my mind?
"I wanted to save.

1127
02:04:22,332 --> 02:04:23,803
You deceived me?

1128
02:04:24,766 --> 02:04:29,875
You can still keep his promise,
can still be together.

1129
02:04:30,130 --> 02:04:33,664
Right here. In a world
we built together.

1130
02:06:31,421 --> 02:06:34,059
Here it is!
Have to go back.

1131
02:06:34,786 --> 02:06:39,408
--Make sure that everything was fine.
"You can stay here with her.

1132
02:06:41,078 --> 02:06:45,227
I will not stay. Saito died
so here somewhere.

1133
02:06:45,262 --> 02:06:47,030
I must find him.

1134
02:06:49,103 --> 02:06:52,386
I will not be with you,
because they do not exist.

1135
02:06:52,802 --> 02:06:55,260
The only way we can be together.

1136
02:06:58,362 --> 02:07:03,381
I would like, but ...

1137
02:07:05,241 --> 02:07:11,793
I can not imagine you in all your vysnít
complexity. Perfection and imperfection.

1138
02:07:11,847 --> 02:07:14,434
You'll be fine.
--Look for yourself.

1139
02:07:16,267 --> 02:07:20,592
You're just a shadow of my real woman.

1140
02:07:21,345 --> 02:07:27,004
I can not do better.
But still not enough.

1141
02:07:27,655 --> 02:07:29,777
Is this enough?
Is this real?

1142
02:07:31,381 --> 02:07:32,590
--What are you doing?
Zachranuju us.

1143
02:07:42,498 --> 02:07:43,505
No, no!

1144
02:07:45,227 --> 02:07:46,698
Open it, do it.

1145
02:08:36,226 --> 02:08:40,003
--I was disappointed ...
--I know, Dad.

1146
02:08:47,768 --> 02:08:52,044
I know you're disappointed,
I'm not like you.

1147
02:08:54,210 --> 02:08:58,337
No, I was disappointed,

1148
02:09:00,559 --> 02:09:01,966
you are so difficult.

1149
02:10:47,912 --> 02:10:50,758
It was a kick, you jump!

1150
02:11:05,288 --> 02:11:08,396
Meet Saito, and come back!
"I'll do it!

1151
02:11:48,601 --> 02:11:52,864
--Remember when you asked me a hand?
--Yes.

1152
02:11:52,899 --> 02:11:56,535
You say you dream
they grow old together.

1153
02:11:59,258 --> 02:12:00,619
But growing old together.

1154
02:12:02,664 --> 02:12:05,113
We age, remember?

1155
02:12:09,797 --> 02:12:12,290
I miss you so,
until it is unbearable ...

1156
02:12:14,834 --> 02:12:16,984
But we have already spent your time.

1157
02:12:18,180 --> 02:12:19,868
I told you about it.

1158
02:12:22,355 --> 02:12:24,366
And now I must go home.

1159
02:13:15,447 --> 02:13:16,660
Sorry, Robert.

1160
02:13:44,370 --> 02:13:47,396
He just wanted me
be on your own.

1161
02:13:48,879 --> 02:13:54,662
Not only was his heir.
And me, uncle.

1162
02:14:04,845 --> 02:14:07,647
--What happened?
Cobb--stay there.

1163
02:14:07,651 --> 02:14:09,975
--Why mal?
No, to find Saito.

1164
02:14:12,275 --> 02:14:13,455
Dissipates.

1165
02:14:16,426 --> 02:14:17,663
No, I can handle it.

1166
02:14:34,143 --> 02:14:36,444
You've come to kill me?

1167
02:14:40,472 --> 02:14:42,723
I'm waiting for someone.

1168
02:14:47,184 --> 02:14:49,664
For someone in the middle
forgotten dreams ...

1169
02:14:52,689 --> 02:14:54,156
Cobb?

1170
02:14:56,242 --> 02:15:01,128
Not possible.
Together, they were young.

1171
02:15:02,718 --> 02:15:07,880
"I'm an old man.
Full--censorship.

1172
02:15:11,371 --> 02:15:15,520
Waiting for a lonely death.

1173
02:15:17,198 --> 02:15:18,936
I returned to you.

1174
02:15:22,777 --> 02:15:26,491
Remember me tell you something ...

1175
02:15:29,698 --> 02:15:31,936
Something you already knew.

1176
02:15:29,698 --> 02:15:31,936
Something you already knew.

1177
02:15:42,143 --> 02:15:50,313
--To be satisfied with our agreement.
He dragged his chance to finish.

1178
02:15:56,354 --> 02:16:03,246
Come back, we can
to be young again.

1179
02:16:07,380 --> 02:16:09,177
Come back to me.

1180
02:16:12,478 --> 02:16:14,127
Back.

1181
02:16:23,854 --> 02:16:29,094
They are landing, sir. We
in Los Angeles for twenty minutes.

1182
02:16:29,095 --> 02:16:30,888
hot towel?
Need immigration form?

1183
02:16:33,404 --> 02:16:34,445
Thank you.

1184
02:16:35,190 --> 02:16:38,296
--Towel, sir?
No..

1185
02:16:38,396 --> 02:16:42,508
Need immigration form?
--Thanks.

1186
02:17:52,011 --> 02:17:55,063
Welcome home, Mr. Cobb.
--Thanks.

1187
02:18:39,940 --> 02:18:41,305
Welcome home.

1188
02:19:11,477 --> 02:19:12,879
Look who's here.

1189
02:19:20,628 --> 02:19:22,638
--Kids!
--Daddy!

1190
02:19:22,738 --> 02:19:25,104
Hello
