Joanie, if you had actually read the story,

Well, they say when they flood
the house and tear it to shreds

that destruction is a form of creation,

208
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,609

00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,931
I'd like to hear about your friend Frank.

354
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,963
Sam Bylen.

355
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,722
[Clears throat]

356
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,689
Donald Darko.

357
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,241
Daye Dennis.

358
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,760
Hey, you fuck.

359
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,525
Did you tell them I flooded the school?

360
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:50,970
- I didn't say shit.
- They think I did it.

361
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:54,203
If you're innocent, you have nothing to worry about.

362
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,925
Fuck you! Know what I think?

363
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:02,121
I think you did it.

364
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:09,122
[Coughs]

365
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:20,408
Beer and pussy. That's all I need.

366
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,926
We gotta find ourselves a Smurfette.

367
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,162
- Smurfette?
- Mm-hm.

368
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,090
Not some tight-assed Middlesex chick.

369
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:31,562
A cute little blonde that'll get
down and dirty with the guys.

370
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:35,850
- Like Smurfette does.
- Smurfette doesn't fuck.

371
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:41,645
Smurfette fucks the other smurfs.
Why did Papa Smurf make her?

372
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:44,690
Because all the other smurfs were getting too horny.

373
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:47,531
Not Vanity. I heard he was a homosexual.

374
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:51,889
OK, she fucks them while Vanity watches. OK?

375
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:55,646
What about Papa Smurf?
He must get in on the action.

376
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:58,371
He does. He films the gangbang.

377
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:01,330
Later on he beats off to the tape.

378
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:07,122
First of all, Papa Smurf didn't create
Smurfette. Gargamel did.

379
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:11,728
She was sent in as Gargamel's spy,
to destroy the smurf village.

380
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:16,124
But the overwhelming goodness
of smurf life transformed her.

381
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,965
And as for the whole gangbang scenario,

382
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,566
it just couldn't happen.

383
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:24,809
Smurfs are asexual.
They don't even have...

384
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:28,248
reproductive organs under those little white pants.

385
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:33,606
That's what's so illogical about being a smurf.

386
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,365
What's the point of living

387
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:38,647
if you don't have a click?

388
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:45,369
Dammit, Donnie, why you gotta get
so smart on us?

389
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,603
- [Car horn]
- Grandma Death.

390
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:51,729
Excuse me! Excuse me!

391
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:58,051
Stay off the road, Miss Sparrow.
I'll have to call social services.

392
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:01,881
I hate that Miss Farmer.
She's such a fucking bitch.

393
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:04,042
Yeah.

394
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,690
- How old is Grandma Death?
- 101.

395
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,766
She does the same thing every day.

396
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:16,687
Just walks back and forth,
back and forth to the mailbox.

397
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,480
And nothing ever in there.

398
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,840
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

399
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,127
She's going back to the box.

400
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,009
We may still have mail.

401
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:34,560
- Mail, mail.
- Here it is.

402
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,723
This could be it. Oh!

403
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:40,491
No dice, Grandma. Sorry.

404
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,608
Someone ought to write that bitch.

405
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,121
<i>[TV announcer] Authorities continued their search</i>

406
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:48,409
<i>for a suspect in the school vandalism.</i>

407
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:53,168
<i>The school has asked for donations
to help restore its mascot,</i>

408
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,720
<i>known only as the Mongrel.</i>

409
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:04,011
In cooperation with the county police,

410
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:08,529
we have begun investigating
the cause of the flooding

411
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:12,161
and our suspects include
several of our own students.

412
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:16,802
I want to know why this filth
is being taught to our children.

413
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,128
[Breathing heavily]

414
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:30,165
Kitty, I would appreciate
if you would wait...

415
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:34,131
Dr. Cole, not only am I a teacher,

416
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:37,562
but I am also a parent of a Middlesex child.

417
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:43,329
I am the only person here who
transcends the parent-teacher bridge.

418
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:49,006
<i>[Frank] Don't worry.</i>

419
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:51,642
<i>You got away with it.</i>

420
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:55,247
I have in my hand Graham Greene's The Destructors.

421
00:37:55,320 --> 00:38:00,201
This short story is part of
my daughter's English assignment.

422
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:04,842
In this story, several children
destroy an elderly man's house

423
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,809
from inside out.

424
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,962
How can you do that?

425
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:27,322
[Laughs nervously]

426
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,362
And how do they do this?

427
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:36,321
They flood the house
by breaking through a water main.

428
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,523
<i>[Frank] I can do anything I want.</i>

429
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,569
<i>And so can you.</i>

430
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:47,002
We pay good money for this school.
It's our children.

431
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:50,641
I think this garbage should be removed.

432
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,609
Excuse me.

433
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:55,530
What's the real issue?
The PTA doesn't ban books.

434
00:38:55,640 --> 00:39:01,761
The PTA is here to acknowledge
that pornography is being taught.

435
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:07,529
- It's meant to be ironic.
- You need to go back to grad school.

436
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:10,080
Why did you make me flood the school?

437
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:17,366
They are in great danger.

438
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,762
Kitty, do you even know who Graham Greene is?

439
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:24,242
I think we have all seen Bonanza.

440
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:31,483
Well, uh... while we are on other topics...

441
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:33,881
Where did you come from?

442
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:38,080
Do you believe in time travel?

443
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,921
[Samantha] Who are you talking to?

444
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,167
I was just taking my pills, Sam.

445
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,407
<i>[TV] It is time to breathe.</i>

446
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,927
<i>Thank you, Jim Cunningham.</i>

447
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,121
<i>Thank you, Jim Cunningham.</i>

448
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,563
<i>Now let us begin lifeline exercise NO.1.</i>

449
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,961
Please press stop <i>now.</i>

450
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:26,728
As you can see, the lifeline is divided
into two polar extremes.

451
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,201
Fear and love.

452
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:33,211
Fear is in the negative energy spectrum

453
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,807
and love is in the positive energy spectrum.

454
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,201
- Duh!
- Excuse me?

455
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:43,166
"Duh" is a product of fear.

456
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:49,008
Now, on each card is a character dilemma

457
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:51,646
which applies to the lifeline.

458
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,480
Please... Take this.

459
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,449
Thank you.

460
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:01,410
Please read each character dilemma aloud

461
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:05,969
and place an X on the lifeline
in the appropriate place.

462
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:08,122
Cherita?

463
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:19,489
"Juanita has an important math test today."

464
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:24,009
"She has known about the test for
several weeks but has not studied."

465
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:27,402
"In order to keep from failing her test,

466
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:31,485
Juanita decides that she will cheat
on the math test."

467
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:37,087
Good. Good. Very good.

468
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,487
Um, Mr. Darko.

469
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:49,885
"Ling Ling finds a wallet filled with money."

470
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:54,807
"She takes the wallet to the address
inside but keeps the money."

471
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:58,726
[Sighs] I'm sorry, Miss Farmer.
I don't get this.

472
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:01,844
Place an X in the appropriate place.

473
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:05,402
No, I know what to do. I don't get this.

474
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:08,165
You can't lump things into two categories.

475
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:11,926
The lifeline is divided that way.

476
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:13,610
Life isn't that simple.

477
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:17,924
Who cares if Ling Ling returns
the wallet and keeps the money?

478
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,685
It has nothing to do with fear or love.

479
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:23,411
Fear and love are the deepest human emotions.

480
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:26,166
OK. But you're not listening to me.

481
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:29,050
Other things need to be taken into account.

482
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:32,090
Like the whole spectrum of human emotion.

483
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:36,683
You can't lump everything into two
categories and deny everything else.

484
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:41,049
If you don't complete the assignment,
you'll get a zero for the day.

485
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,604
Donald.

486
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:51,281
Let me preface this by saying that your Iowa Test scores

487
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:55,160
are... intimidating.

488
00:42:57,240 --> 00:43:01,086
So... let's go over this again.

489
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:04,607
What exactly did you say to Mrs. Farmer?

490
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,962
I'll tell you what he said.

491
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:12,971
He asked me to forcibly insert
the exercise card into my anus.

492
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:15,088
[Laughs then coughs]

493
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:23,930
[woman] These are modern times.
My political attitudes are forthright.

494
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:29,723
If there's a vice presidential candidate
worthy of my vote, it's Dan Quayle.

495
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:34,488
Nobody cares about responsibility,
morality, family values...

496
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:40,368
Kitty...

497
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:42,329
Excuse us, please.

498
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:50,485
He's suspended from after-school
activities for six months.

499
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:58,128
Ever since this jet engine fiasco
I don't know what's gotten into him.

500
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:02,603
Rose, our daughters have been on
the dance team together for two years

501
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:04,808
and I respect you as a woman.

502
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:10,250
But after witnessing your son's
behaviour, I have doubts about your...

503
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:14,650
Our paths through life must be righteous.

504
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:18,008
I urge you to go home and look in the mirror,

505
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:21,806
and pray that your son
doesn't succumb to the path of fear.

506
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:31,970
[Elizabeth] Do you remember
that weird gym teacher Mrs. Farmer?

507
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:34,810
Yeah.

508
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:38,851
My brother told her to shove a book
up her ass today.

509
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:42,925
And then my parents just bought him
all this new shit.

510
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:47,204
I know. I wish a jet engine would fall in my room.

511
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:52,564
<i>[Frank] I can show you the way.</i>

512
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,482
[Bells chime]

513
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:00,968
Yeah.

514
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:03,122
[Boys laugh]

515
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:07,242
- Dr. Monnitoff?
- Donnie.

516
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:11,086
Um, I know this is gonna sound kinda weird, but uh...

517
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:15,489
do you know anything about time travel?

518
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:23,851
Ah! A wormhole with an Einstein-Rosen bridge,

519
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:29,245
which is theoretically a wormhole
in space controlled by man.

520
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:34,251
So, according to Hawking,

521
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:37,642
a wormhole may be able to provide a short cut

522
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:40,724
for jumping between
two distant regions of space time.

523
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:42,490
So to travel back in time,

524
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:46,042
you have to have a spaceship
that can travel faster than light.

525
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:49,283
- Theoretically.
- And be able to find a wormhole.

526
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:51,687
The principles of time travel are there.

527
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:53,842
You've got a vessel, a portal.

528
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:56,611
The vessel can be anything.
Probably a spacecraft.

529
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:59,405
- Like a DeLorean.
- Any metal craft.

530
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:05,487
I love that movie, the way they shot it.
It's so futuristic, you know.

531
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:10,569
Listen... don't tell anybody I gave you this.

532
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:13,405
The woman who wrote this used to teach here.

533
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:16,689
She was a nun many years before that.

534
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:21,766
Then overnight she became
this entirely different person.

535
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:25,367
She up and left the church, she wrote this book.

536
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:27,721
She started teaching science.

537
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:29,882
Right here in Middlesex.

538
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:33,161

539
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:36,728
Roberta Sparrow?

540
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,882
That's right.

541
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,241
[Laughs] Come on.

542
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:44,322
Roberta Sparrow.

543
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:05,968
Roberta Sparrow...

544
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,602
Grandma Death.

545
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:13,205
<i>It's called The Philosophy Of Time Travel.</i>

546
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:16,886
What does philosophy have to do with time travel?

547
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:20,646
- Let me see.
- Guess who wrote it.

548
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:22,768
Roberta Sparrow?

549
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,968
Huh! She wrote a book!

550
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:27,361
Grandma Death wrote a book.

551
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:30,042
That's a terrible nickname.

552
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:33,247
We almost hit her with the car.

553
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:38,323
She lives in that piece of crap house
and you know she's loaded.

554
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:40,681
- She's...
- You're right.

555
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:43,923
She used to be known for her gem collection.

556
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:50,043
Kids... used to go up there
and try to steal stuff from her.

557
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:52,808
She became a total recluse.

558
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:58,009
I didn't know she was alive
till we damn near knocked her down.

559
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:05,410
[Donny] She was standing in the road, frozen,

560
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:10,321
so I got out of the car and
walked over to see if she was OK.

561
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,926
She leaned over and whispered in my ear.

562
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:16,806
- What did she say?
- Frank wants me to talk to her.

563
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:20,362
He asked me if I knew about time travel.

564
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:24,604
She wrote a book about it,
so it can't be a coincidence.

565
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:30,127
What did Roberta Sparrow say to you?

566
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:35,602
She said every creature on earth dies alone.

567
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:41,848
How did that make you feel?

568
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,571
It reminded me of my dog Callie.

569
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:52,361
She died when I was eight.

570
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:56,001
She crawled underneath the porch.

571
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:01,807
To die?

572
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:05,968
To be alone.

573
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:09,327
Do you feel alone right now?

574
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:16,682
I...

575
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:21,923
I'd like to believe I'm not, but I just...

576
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:25,810
I've just never seen any proof, so I...

577
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:28,446
I just don't debate it any more.

578
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:31,683
I could spend my whole life debating it over and over

579
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:34,201
and I still wouldn't have any proof,

580
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:37,608
so I just... I just don't debate it any more.

581
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:40,206
[Laughs] It's absurd.

582
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:45,922
The search for God is absurd?

583
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:50,647
It is if everyone dies alone.

584
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,525
Does that scare you?

585
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:59,522
I don't want to be alone.

586
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:15,326
His tapes have made me realise

587
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:20,566
that for the last 39 years I have been
a prisoner of my own fear.

588
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:23,448
- Fear?
- [Sighs]

589
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:26,808
Rose, you have got to meet this Jim Cunningham.

590
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:29,921

and take all the pain and darkness

- Images?
- Yeah. Like a Hawaiian sunset

that remind you how beautiful...

00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:36,090
Yeah.

- I... Sorry...
- Donnie, wait. I just...

619
00:53:55,480 --> 00:54:01,567
I just want it to be at a time when it...

620
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:05,611
- When what?
- When it reminds me of...

621
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:10,363
When it reminds you how beautiful the world can be?

622
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:12,249

Thank you for seeing us at such late notice.

625
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:32,084
We both felt it was time to come in and discuss...

626
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:34,885
What I think is going on with your son?

627
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,287
Yes.

628
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:40,807
Um... Well, he's uh...

629
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:46,444
You know about his past,
and he was suspended from school

630
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:48,682
for insulting his gym teacher.

631
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:53,368
I'm not sure that's a good example.
He had just cause to insult...

632
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:57,684
Rose, let me just lay out
what I believe is happening here.

633
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:04,162
Donnie's aggressive behaviour...

634
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:08,566
his increased detachment from reality...

635
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:12,685
seem to stem from his inability to cope

636
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:16,924
with the forces in the world
that he perceives to be threatening.

637
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:24,491
Has he ever told you about his friend Frank?

638
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:31,527
Frank?

639
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:33,483
The giant bunny rabbit.

640
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:36,209
What?

641
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:45,849
I don't recall him ever having mentioned a rabbit.

642
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:50,926
Donnie is experiencing what is called
a daylight hallucination.

643
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:58,480
This is a common occurrence
among paranoid schizophrenics.

644
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:02,642
What can we do?

645
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:06,930
I would like to do more hypnotherapy.

646
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:11,401
And increase his medication.

647
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:17,922
[Thunderclap]

648
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:23,604
Whatever will help him, really,
because that's why we're here.

649
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:28,766
We just would like him to experience some... relief.

650
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:33,687
So if you think that more medication will do that,

651
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:38,129
then I think we should give it a try.

652
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:41,531
[Bells chime]

653
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:52,928
Donnie Darko.

654
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:57,848
I know.

655
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:00,651

657
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:09,930
- Good morning, you Mongrels.
- Good morning.

658
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,083
Is that all the gusto you can muster?
Good morning!

659
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:15,328
Good morning.

660
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:17,721
Now, that's a tiny bit better.

661
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:23,204
But I can sense some students
who are afraid to say good morning.

662
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:25,408
[Students] Good morning!

663
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:27,448
That's what I like to hear!

664
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:30,530
Entirely too many
young men and women today

665
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:33,649
are completely paralysed by their fears.

666
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:38,601
They surrender their bodies
to the temptation and destruction

667
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:41,769
of drugs, alcohol and premarital sex.

668
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:46,730
Now, I'm gonna tell you a little story today.

669
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:48,968
It's a heartbreakingly sad story

670
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:53,329
about a young man
whose life was completely destroyed

671
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:55,607
by these instruments of fear.

672
00:57:55,720 --> 00:58:01,090
A young man searching for love
in all the wrong places.

673
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:04,207
His name was Frank.

674
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:13,369
Um, my stepsister...
I sometimes worry that she eats too much.

675
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:16,091
- Shut up, Kim.
- Sweetheart, please.

676
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:20,643
- What can I do when I grow up?
- That's a hard one.

677
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:22,802
How do I learn how to fight?

678
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:25,884
"How do I learn how to fight?"

679
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:30,284
Son, violence is a product of fear.

680
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:33,529
- Learn to truly love yourself.
- OK.

681
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:35,967
- Get up here.
- OK.

682
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:38,202
All right.

683
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:43,403
- Good morning.
- [Jim] Good morning.

684
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:46,490
Um, how much are they paying you
to be here?

685
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,525
Excuse me?

686
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:53,324
What is your name, son?

687
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:55,289
Gerald.

688
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:58,443
Gerald, I think you're afraid.

689
00:58:58,520 --> 00:59:03,970
Are you telling us this so we buy your
book? It's the worst advice I heard.

690
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:05,929
You see how sad this is?

691
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:11,769
Want your sister to lose weight? Tell
her to get off the couch and exercise.

692
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:15,009
No-one knows what to do when they grow up.

693
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:18,766
It takes a while to find that out. Right, Jim?

694
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:20,888
And you.

695
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:22,962
Yeah, you.

696
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:26,129
You sick of some jerk picking on you?

697
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:29,602
Maybe you should lift weights or do karate.

698
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:32,485

01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:10,289
It gives me great pleasure to
announce that the school dance team

879
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:14,769
has been invited to perform
on Ed McMahon's Star Search '88

880
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:17,571

883
01:17:57,160 --> 01:17:59,925
- Rose.
- Kitty.

884
01:18:00,720 --> 01:18:05,567
I'm sure you're aware of the horrible
allegations against Jim Cunningham.

885
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:09,087
I saw it on TV.
Something about a kiddie porn...

886

Oh, please! Don't use those words!

887
01:18:13,320 --> 01:18:17,405
It's obviously a conspiracy
to destroy an innocent man.

888
01:18:17,480 --> 01:18:22,441
I am going to spearhead the
Jim Cunningham defence campaign.

889
01:18:24,240 --> 01:18:28,564
Rose, I have to appear
at his arraignment tomorrow morning.

890
01:18:28,760 --> 01:18:32,810
The girls are scheduled to leave
for Los Angeles in the morning.

891
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:37,204
As their coach, I was the
obvious choice to chaperone them...

892
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:40,170
But now you can't go.

893
01:18:40,240 --> 01:18:41,890

- Hm.

894
01:18:41,960 --> 01:18:44,691

895

896
01:18:46,920 --> 01:18:50,163
