John!

Your foster parents are kind of dicks, huh?

50
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:31,767
I swear, I have had it with that goddamn kid.

51
00:13:31,986 --> 00:13:34,478
- He won't even answer me anymore.
- Honey, move.

52
00:13:34,697 --> 00:13:37,485
Would you get off your butt and help me?

53
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:40,408
- Todd!
- What?

54
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,863
He hasn't cleaned that room of his
in a month.

55
00:13:44,082 --> 00:13:46,995
Well, it's an emergency.
Hang on. I'll get right on it.

56
00:13:54,801 --> 00:13:56,542
- Come on!
- John!

57
00:13:56,761 --> 00:13:59,879
C'mon! Get your ass inside.
Do what your mother tells you.

58
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,723
She's not my mother, Todd.

59
00:14:30,503 --> 00:14:31,960
This next patient is interesting.

60
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:34,629
I've been following the case for years.

61
00:14:34,841 --> 00:14:36,833
A 29-year-old female,

62
00:14:39,262 --> 00:14:41,800
diagnosed as acute schizo-affective disorder.

63
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:44,051
The usual indicators: depression, anxiety,

64
00:14:44,267 --> 00:14:46,805
violent acting out, delusions of persecution.

65
00:14:53,484 --> 00:14:56,602
The delusional architecture is fairly unique.

66
00:14:56,821 --> 00:14:59,655
She believes that a machine
called the Terminator,

67
00:14:59,866 --> 00:15:03,867
which looked human, of course,
was sent back through time to kill her.

68
00:15:04,078 --> 00:15:05,194
That's original.

69
00:15:05,413 --> 00:15:08,121
And also, that the father of her child

70
00:15:08,332 --> 00:15:11,166
was a soldier sent back to protect her.

71
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:13,664
- No?
- He was from the future too.

72
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:18,671
The year 2029, if I remember correctly.

73
00:15:18,885 --> 00:15:20,751
And here we are.

74
00:15:21,596 --> 00:15:22,632
Morning, Sarah.

75
00:15:27,101 --> 00:15:30,936
Good morning, Dr Silberman. How's the knee?

76
00:15:32,857 --> 00:15:34,723
Fine, Sarah.

77
00:15:35,943 --> 00:15:41,109
She, er... stabbed me in the kneecap
with my pen a few weeks ago.

78
00:15:41,949 --> 00:15:43,281
Repeated escape attempts...

79
00:15:53,628 --> 00:15:55,711
Let's move on, shall we?

80
00:15:55,922 --> 00:15:59,547
Lewis, I don't like to see the patients
disrupting their rooms like this.

81
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,843
- See she takes her Thorazine.
- Sure. I'll take care of it.

82
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:28,402
Are you the legal guardian of John Connor?

83
00:16:29,163 --> 00:16:31,530
That's right, Officer. What's he done now?

84
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:35,083
- Could I speak with him, please?
- You could if he were here.

85
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:38,002
He took off on his bike this morning
so he could be anywhere.

86
00:16:38,214 --> 00:16:41,707
- Do you have a photograph of John?
- Yeah. Hold on.

87
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:47,012
You gonna tell me what this is about?

88
00:16:47,223 --> 00:16:49,089
I just need to ask him a few questions.

89
00:16:51,561 --> 00:16:54,554
He's a good-looking boy.
Do you mind if I keep this picture?

90
00:16:54,772 --> 00:16:58,015
No, go on. There was a guy here
this morning looking for him, too.

91
00:16:58,234 --> 00:16:59,941
Yeah, a big guy on a bike.

92
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:02,064
Has that got something to do with this?

93
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:08,325
No. I wouldn't worry about him.

94
00:17:09,662 --> 00:17:12,245
Thanks for your cooperation.

95
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:15,991
Please insert your stolen card now.

96
00:17:23,676 --> 00:17:25,258
PIN number.

97
00:17:26,637 --> 00:17:29,672
- Hurry up. This is taking too long.
- Go, baby. Go, baby.

98
00:17:31,392 --> 00:17:32,724
All right!

99
00:17:32,935 --> 00:17:36,428
- PIN number 9003.
- Where'd you learn this stuff from?

100
00:17:36,647 --> 00:17:39,060
From my mom. My real mom, I mean.

101
00:17:40,234 --> 00:17:43,352
Withdraw three-zero-zero bucks.

102
00:17:43,571 --> 00:17:46,279
Come on, baby. Come on! Come on!

103
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:48,573
- Yes!
- Hey, it worked.

104
00:17:48,784 --> 00:17:52,323
All right. Easy money. Come on!

105
00:17:54,957 --> 00:17:56,949
Yes! Piece of cake.

106
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:05,336
- Is that her?
- Yes.

107
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:09,591
- She's pretty cool, huh?
- No, she's a complete psycho.

108
00:18:09,805 --> 00:18:13,424
That's why she's at Pescadero.
It's a mental institute, okay?

109
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:17,681
She tried to blow up a computer factory,
but she got shot and arrested.

110
00:18:17,897 --> 00:18:19,354
No shit.

111
00:18:20,191 --> 00:18:22,478
She's a total loser.

112
00:18:22,693 --> 00:18:25,276
Come on. Let's go spend some money.

113
00:18:40,836 --> 00:18:44,375
It's like a giant strobe light

114
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,832
burning right through my eyes.

115
00:18:51,055 --> 00:18:53,297
Somehow, I can still see.

116
00:18:59,355 --> 00:19:01,142
Oh, God.

117
00:19:04,819 --> 00:19:07,903
We know the dream's the same every night.

118
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:11,444
- Why do I have to...
- Please continue.

119
00:19:15,371 --> 00:19:17,863
Children look like burnt paper.

120
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:21,082
Black.

121
00:19:22,044 --> 00:19:23,660
Not moving.

122
00:19:25,589 --> 00:19:28,423
And then the blast wave hits them.

123
00:19:37,393 --> 00:19:39,806
And they fly apart like leaves.

124
00:19:41,772 --> 00:19:46,938
Dreams of cataclysm,
the end of the world are very common.

125
00:19:48,946 --> 00:19:53,031
It's not a dream, you moron. It's real.

126
00:19:53,242 --> 00:19:56,986
- I know the date it happens.
- I'm sure it feels very real to you.

127
00:19:57,204 --> 00:20:02,290
On August 29, 1997, it's gonna feel
pretty fuckin' real to you, too!

128
00:20:03,586 --> 00:20:05,953
Anybody not wearing two-million sunblock

129
00:20:06,172 --> 00:20:08,664
is gonna have a real bad day. Get it?

130
00:20:09,175 --> 00:20:11,883
God! You think you're safe and alive.

131
00:20:12,094 --> 00:20:14,256
You're already dead. Everybody!

132
00:20:14,472 --> 00:20:16,885
Him. You. You're dead already.

133
00:20:17,099 --> 00:20:19,842
This whole place, everything you see is gone!

134
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:23,019
You're the one
living in a fucking dream, Silberman!

135
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:25,813
Cos I know it happened! It happened!

136
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:39,031
I feel much better now.

137
00:20:40,247 --> 00:20:41,988
Clearer.

138
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:47,545
Yes, your attitude has been
much improved lately.

139
00:20:56,764 --> 00:20:59,097
It's helped me to have a goal,

140
00:20:59,892 --> 00:21:02,350
something to look forward to.

141
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:03,597
What is that?

142
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:09,942
Well, you said that if I showed
improvement after six months,

143
00:21:10,152 --> 00:21:12,690
you would transfer me
to the minimum security wing

144
00:21:12,905 --> 00:21:15,989
and I could have visitors.

145
00:21:17,284 --> 00:21:20,573
Well, it's been six months and...

146
00:21:22,498 --> 00:21:24,615
I was looking forward to seeing my son.

147
00:21:25,835 --> 00:21:27,326
I see.

148
00:21:30,506 --> 00:21:35,592
Let's go back to what you were saying
about those Terminator machines.

149
00:21:35,803 --> 00:21:39,046
Now you think they don't exist?

150
00:21:39,265 --> 00:21:41,473
They don't exist.

151
00:21:41,684 --> 00:21:43,266
I know that now.

152
00:21:43,477 --> 00:21:45,264
But you've told me on many occasions

153
00:21:45,479 --> 00:21:48,813
about how you crushed one
in a hydraulic press.

154
00:21:50,192 --> 00:21:53,185
If I had, there would have been
some evidence.

155
00:21:53,404 --> 00:21:55,691
They would have found something
at the factory.

156
00:21:55,906 --> 00:21:57,898
I see.

157
00:21:58,117 --> 00:22:01,952
So, you don't believe any more
that the company covered it up?

158
00:22:04,123 --> 00:22:06,581
No. Why would they?

159
00:22:07,501 --> 00:22:09,743
Let's try a new position right there.

160
00:22:09,962 --> 00:22:14,127
The neuronal sensors are correct,
because it works.

161
00:22:14,341 --> 00:22:16,833
- Right.
- Those neurons are all centred.

162
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,712
Maybe the inhibitor circuits failed...

163
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:21,011
Mr Dyson?

164
00:22:21,849 --> 00:22:24,887
Mr Dyson, the materials team
is running another...

165
00:22:26,061 --> 00:22:27,597
- Mr Dyson.
- Yes?

166
00:22:27,813 --> 00:22:30,647
The materials team is running
another series this afternoon.

167
00:22:30,858 --> 00:22:33,692
You have to sign for the... Er... it.

168
00:22:33,903 --> 00:22:36,816
- You have to sign it out.
- Okay. Come on. I'll get it.

169
00:22:38,616 --> 00:22:39,652
Mr Dyson,

170
00:22:39,867 --> 00:22:41,699
I know I haven't been here long, but
I was wondering if you could tell me,

171
00:22:41,911 --> 00:22:44,073
- I mean, if you know...
- Know what?

172
00:22:44,288 --> 00:22:46,826
Well, if you know where "it" came from.

173
00:22:47,041 --> 00:22:50,330
I asked them that very same question
once. You know what they told me?

174
00:22:50,544 --> 00:22:51,705
"Don't ask."

175
00:22:58,427 --> 00:23:00,510
- Good morning, Mr Dyson.
- How's it going?

176
00:23:01,513 --> 00:23:02,799
Insert key.

177
00:23:03,015 --> 00:23:05,974
Left on three, two, one, turn.

178
00:23:09,897 --> 00:23:11,638
- How are the wife and kids?
- Great. Thanks.

179
00:23:11,857 --> 00:23:13,018
There you go.

180
00:23:40,844 --> 00:23:43,302
So, what do you think, Doctor?

181
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:46,131
I have shown improvement, haven't I?

182
00:23:47,518 --> 00:23:50,556
Well, Sarah, here's the problem.

183
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,096
I know how smart you are.

184
00:23:53,857 --> 00:23:55,814
I think you're just telling me
what I want to hear.

185
00:23:57,069 --> 00:23:59,652
I don't think you really believe
what you're telling me today.

186
00:23:59,947 --> 00:24:03,857
I think if I put you in minimum security,
you'll just try to escape again.

187
00:24:08,956 --> 00:24:11,539
You have to let me see my son.

188
00:24:12,501 --> 00:24:13,992
Please.

189
00:24:15,504 --> 00:24:16,790
Please.

190
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:21,959
He's in great danger. He's naked without me.

191
00:24:22,177 --> 00:24:23,918
If I could just make a phone call...

192
00:24:24,138 --> 00:24:27,051
Afraid not. Not for a while.

193
00:24:28,934 --> 00:24:31,267
I don't see any choice
but to recommend to the review board

194
00:24:31,478 --> 00:24:33,765
that you stay here for another six months.

195
00:24:37,109 --> 00:24:39,350
I'll kill you, you son of a bitch!

196
00:24:41,447 --> 00:24:44,690
- Get her off of me!
- You son of a bitch!

197
00:24:44,908 --> 00:24:47,150
10cc of sodium amobarbital, stat!

198
00:24:48,829 --> 00:24:51,446
- You don't know what you're doing!
- Get some restraints in here now!

199
00:24:54,209 --> 00:24:56,826
You don't know what you're doing!

200
00:25:01,258 --> 00:25:03,295
Model citizen.

201
00:25:42,674 --> 00:25:45,257
You just missed him.
He was here 15 minutes ago.

202
00:25:45,469 --> 00:25:47,051
He said he was going to the galleria?

203
00:25:47,262 --> 00:25:48,298
Yeah.

204
00:25:48,514 --> 00:25:50,130
The galleria?

205
00:26:36,186 --> 00:26:38,553
I'm gonna get some quarters.
I'll be back, all right?

206
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:56,237
- Oh, no!
- Girls, do you know John Connor?

207
00:26:56,456 --> 00:26:57,947
No.

208
00:27:00,127 --> 00:27:03,996
- Hey, do you know this guy?
- Nah, I don't know him.

209
00:27:10,596 --> 00:27:12,178
- John.
- Not now.

210
00:27:12,389 --> 00:27:15,223
Hey, there's this cop
scoping for you. Check it out.

211
00:27:18,687 --> 00:27:20,599
- He's right over there.
- Split, man.

212
00:27:20,814 --> 00:27:22,726
- Just go.
- Yeah.

213
00:27:27,988 --> 00:27:28,978
I saw that kid...

214
00:27:29,198 --> 00:27:30,314
Hey!

215
00:27:44,671 --> 00:27:46,378
Hey! You're not supposed to be in here!

216
00:28:04,566 --> 00:28:06,102
Hey!

217
00:28:12,241 --> 00:28:13,277
Get down.

218
00:29:24,438 --> 00:29:26,225
Mister, are you all right?

219
00:29:44,082 --> 00:29:45,118
Come on!

220
00:30:25,374 --> 00:30:26,706
Goddamn!

221
00:35:05,862 --> 00:35:08,229
Okay. Time out. Stop the bike.

222
00:35:08,448 --> 00:35:10,360
Time out. Come on, stop the bike.

223
00:35:24,214 --> 00:35:26,797
Holy shit.
Now, don't take this the wrong way.

224
00:35:27,008 --> 00:35:29,045
- But you are a Terminator, right?
- Yes.

225
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:33,095
- Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.
- No?

226
00:35:43,817 --> 00:35:47,902
Holy shit! You're really real.

227
00:35:50,323 --> 00:35:51,780
I mean...

228
00:35:54,452 --> 00:35:58,822
You're like a machine underneath,
right? But sort of alive outside?

229
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,827
I'm a cybernetic organism:

230
00:36:01,042 --> 00:36:03,580
living tissue over metal endoskeleton.

231
00:36:18,476 --> 00:36:20,513
This is intense.

232
00:36:20,729 --> 00:36:23,437
Get a grip, John. Okay.

233
00:36:26,109 --> 00:36:28,101
You're not here to kill me.

234
00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:32,233
I figured that part out for myself.
So what's the deal?

235
00:36:32,449 --> 00:36:35,032
My mission is to protect you.

236
00:36:35,243 --> 00:36:37,735
Yeah? Who sent you?

237
00:36:39,038 --> 00:36:40,028
You did.

238
00:36:40,248 --> 00:36:41,580
35 years from now,

239
00:36:41,791 --> 00:36:45,159
you reprogrammed me to be
your protector here, in this time.

240
00:36:45,378 --> 00:36:48,121
Oh, this is deep.

241
00:36:50,216 --> 00:36:53,254
So this other guy,
he's a Terminator like you, right?

242
00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:56,929
Not like me. A T-1000, advanced prototype.

243
00:36:58,641 --> 00:37:03,056
- More advanced than you are?
- Yes. A mimetic poly-alloy.

244
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:06,393
- What the hell does that mean?
- Liquid metal.

245
00:37:08,151 --> 00:37:09,267
Where are we going?

246
00:37:09,486 --> 00:37:12,687
We have to get out of the city
immediately and avoid the authorities.

247
00:37:13,490 --> 00:37:16,153
Listen, I got to stop by my house.
I want to pick up some stuff.

248
00:37:16,367 --> 00:37:20,327
Negative. The T-1000 would definitely
try to reacquire you there.

249
00:37:20,538 --> 00:37:23,201
- You sure?
- I would.

250
00:37:33,968 --> 00:37:36,551
Look, Todd and Janelle are dicks...

251
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:40,222
...but I gotta warn them.

252
00:37:40,433 --> 00:37:42,766
Shit! You got a quarter?

253
00:37:51,611 --> 00:37:54,479
- Hello.
- 'Janelle, it's me.'

254
00:37:54,697 --> 00:37:56,905
- John?
- 'Yeah. Is everything all right?'

255
00:37:57,116 --> 00:37:59,403
- Are you guys okay?
- 'Sure, honey, everything's okay.'

256
00:37:59,619 --> 00:38:02,612
- Are you all right?
- 'Yeah, I'm fine.'

257
00:38:02,831 --> 00:38:06,290
John, it's late.
I was beginning to worry about you.

258
00:38:06,501 --> 00:38:09,039
If you hurry home, we can sit down
and have dinner together.

259
00:38:09,254 --> 00:38:10,665
I'm making beef stew.

260
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,963
Something's wrong. She's never this nice.

261
00:38:13,174 --> 00:38:15,541
John, where are you?

262
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,503
What the hell is the goddamn dog barking at?

263
00:38:18,721 --> 00:38:21,839
Hey, shut up, you worthless piece of shit!

264
00:38:22,058 --> 00:38:23,390
The dog's really barking.

265
00:38:23,601 --> 00:38:25,684
You were gonna tell the kid
to get rid of that fucking mutt.

266
00:38:29,732 --> 00:38:32,149
John, honey, it's late.
Please don't make me worry.

267
00:38:32,369 --> 00:38:34,385
Could he already be there?

268
00:38:35,495 --> 00:38:38,943
- Honey, are you okay?
- I'm right here. I'm fine.

269
00:38:39,158 --> 00:38:40,649
'Are you sure you're all right?'

270
00:38:40,869 --> 00:38:43,657
- What's the dog's name?
- Max.

271
00:38:44,289 --> 00:38:46,497
Janelle, what's wrong with Wolfie?

272
00:38:46,708 --> 00:38:49,166
I can hear him barking. Is he okay?

273
00:38:49,377 --> 00:38:52,040
Wolfie's fine, honey. Wolfie's just fine.

274
00:38:53,381 --> 00:38:54,872
Where are you?

275
00:38:56,676 --> 00:38:58,542
Your foster parents are dead.

276
00:39:35,548 --> 00:39:37,540
No, no. I need a minute here.

277
00:39:37,759 --> 00:39:41,924
You're telling me that this thing
can imitate anything it touches?

278
00:39:42,138 --> 00:39:44,471
Anything it samples by physical contact.

279
00:39:44,682 --> 00:39:46,469
Get real.

280
00:39:46,684 --> 00:39:50,303
It could disguise itself
as a pack of cigarettes?

281
00:39:50,521 --> 00:39:52,183
No, only an object of equal size.

282
00:39:52,398 --> 00:39:54,811
Why not just become a bomb
or something to get me?

283
00:39:55,026 --> 00:39:57,063
It can't form complex machines.

284
00:39:57,278 --> 00:39:59,235
Guns and explosives
have chemicals, moving parts.

285
00:39:59,447 --> 00:40:00,733
It doesn't work that way.

286
00:40:00,949 --> 00:40:03,737
- But it can form solid metal shapes.
- Like what?

287
00:40:03,952 --> 00:40:05,944
Knives and stabbing weapons.

288
00:40:06,871 --> 00:40:09,204
These were taken
by a video surveillance camera

289
00:40:09,415 --> 00:40:12,783
at the West Highland Police Station in 1984.

290
00:40:14,295 --> 00:40:17,208
He killed 17 police officers that night.

291
00:40:18,841 --> 00:40:20,958
Men with families...

292
00:40:22,345 --> 00:40:23,927
...children.

293
00:40:25,431 --> 00:40:29,766
These were taken at a mall in Reseda today.

294
00:40:31,145 --> 00:40:35,059
Miss Connor, we know
you know who this guy is.

295
00:40:37,235 --> 00:40:41,525
Look, I just sat here and told you
that your son is missing.

296
00:40:41,739 --> 00:40:43,605
That the foster parents have been murdered.

297
00:40:43,825 --> 00:40:46,067
We know this guy's involved.

298
00:40:47,286 --> 00:40:51,121
Doesn't that mean anything to you?
Don't you care?

299
00:40:55,503 --> 00:41:01,625
- We're wasting our time. Let's go.
- Sorry, guys.

300
00:41:01,843 --> 00:41:06,045
She's grown more and more disconnected
from reality as time goes on.

301
00:41:06,264 --> 00:41:07,926
I'm afraid she can't help us now.

302
00:41:08,141 --> 00:41:11,805
If she clears at all and can
give us anything, I'll call you.

303
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:13,352
Sure.

304
00:41:13,563 --> 00:41:16,306
Douglas, take her back to her room, please.

305
00:41:16,524 --> 00:41:17,605
Yes, sir.

306
00:41:19,277 --> 00:41:21,314
Come on, sweetheart. Let's go.

307
00:41:21,529 --> 00:41:26,490
You see, we spent a lot of time
in Nicaragua and places like that.

308
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:32,238
For a while there, she was with
this crazy ex-Green Beret guy

309
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:33,656
running guns.

310
00:41:33,875 --> 00:41:36,709
Then there were some other guys.

311
00:41:36,919 --> 00:41:38,660
She'd shack up with anybody
she could learn from

312
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:42,089
so she could teach me how to be
this great military leader.

313
00:41:43,968 --> 00:41:45,880
Then she gets busted.

314
00:41:46,095 --> 00:41:49,588
It's like, "Sorry, kid. Your mom's
a psycho. Didn't you know?"

315
00:41:51,934 --> 00:41:55,803
It's like everything I'd been brought up
to believe was all made-up bullshit.

316
00:41:56,022 --> 00:41:58,435
I hated her for that.

317
00:42:01,778 --> 00:42:04,395
But everything she said was true.

318
00:42:05,782 --> 00:42:07,648
She knew.

319
00:42:09,911 --> 00:42:11,903
And nobody believed her.

320
00:42:13,748 --> 00:42:15,580
Not even me.

321
00:42:17,627 --> 00:42:19,368
Listen, we gotta get her out of there.

322
00:42:19,587 --> 00:42:22,921
Negative. The T-1000's
highest probability for success now

323
00:42:23,132 --> 00:42:26,041
will be to copy Sarah Connor and wait
for you to make contact with her.

324
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:28,217
Great. What happens to her?

325
00:42:28,429 --> 00:42:31,172
Typically, the subject
being copied is terminated.

326
00:42:31,390 --> 00:42:34,349
Shit! Why didn't you tell me?
We gotta go right now!

327
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,677
Negative. It's not a mission priority.

328
00:42:36,896 --> 00:42:38,888
Fuck you! She's a priority to me!

329
00:42:40,775 --> 00:42:43,609
Goddamn it! What's your problem? Damn it!

330
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:46,654
- Help! Help!
- This does not help our mission.

331
00:42:46,864 --> 00:42:49,197
Get this psycho off of me! Help!

332
00:42:49,408 --> 00:42:52,321
Help! I'm being kidnapped!
Get this psycho off of me!

333
00:42:52,537 --> 00:42:53,448
Let me go!

334
00:42:58,126 --> 00:43:01,745
- Why the hell did you do that?
- Because you told me to.

335
00:43:04,590 --> 00:43:06,252
What?

336
00:43:11,097 --> 00:43:13,054
You have to do what I say, huh?

337
00:43:13,266 --> 00:43:15,349
That's one of my mission parameters.

338
00:43:16,644 --> 00:43:20,137
Prove it. Stand on one foot.

339
00:43:22,358 --> 00:43:23,690
Yes!

340
00:43:25,903 --> 00:43:29,487
Cool. My own Terminator. Wow.

341
00:43:30,992 --> 00:43:33,700
- You okay, kid?
- Take a hike, bozo.

342
00:43:33,911 --> 00:43:38,326
- Let's get outta here, man.
- Fuck you, you little dipshit!

343
00:43:39,167 --> 00:43:40,749
Dipshit?

344
00:43:42,795 --> 00:43:44,787
Put your leg down.

345
00:43:45,006 --> 00:43:49,671
- Did you call <i>moi</i> a dipshit?
- Just trying to help this punk.

346
00:43:49,886 --> 00:43:52,128
Grab this guy.
I can't believe he called me...

347
00:43:52,346 --> 00:43:54,963
Agh! God! Get him off of me!

348
00:43:55,183 --> 00:43:58,221
Now who's the dipshit, you jock douche bag?

349
00:43:58,436 --> 00:43:59,643
Get off me!

350
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:06,976
No!

351
00:44:08,237 --> 00:44:10,524
Put the gun down, now!

352
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:13,904
- Get outta here!
- Come on. Let's split!

353
00:44:20,917 --> 00:44:22,749
Jesus! You were gonna kill that guy!

354
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,952
Of course. I'm a Terminator.

355
00:44:27,298 --> 00:44:29,836
Listen to me very carefully, okay?

356
00:44:30,051 --> 00:44:33,260
You're not a Terminator anymore, all right?

357
00:44:33,471 --> 00:44:35,554
You got that?

358
00:44:35,765 --> 00:44:38,098
You just can't go around killing people.

359
00:44:38,309 --> 00:44:39,174
Why?

360
00:44:40,144 --> 00:44:42,306
What do you mean, why? Cos you can't.

361
00:44:42,521 --> 00:44:43,352
Why?

362
00:44:43,564 --> 00:44:46,227
Because you just can't. Trust me on this.

363
00:44:52,281 --> 00:44:55,740
Look, I'm gonna go get my mom.

364
00:44:55,952 --> 00:44:59,366
And I order you to help me.

365
00:47:25,101 --> 00:47:26,137
Hi!

366
00:47:26,352 --> 00:47:30,392
- You have a Sarah Connor here?
- You're running late, aren't you?

367
00:47:30,606 --> 00:47:32,848
They've been in there for an hour.

368
00:47:33,067 --> 00:47:35,400
Hold on a second. I'll buzz you in.

369
00:47:37,279 --> 00:47:39,896
Oh, here come your friends now.

370
00:47:59,593 --> 00:48:01,505
Well, that was productive.

371
00:48:42,970 --> 00:48:45,963
- Hey, Gwen, you want some coffee?
- No, thanks.

372
00:48:46,724 --> 00:48:47,714
How 'bout a beer?

373
00:48:47,933 --> 00:48:49,344
Yeah, right!

374
00:49:13,417 --> 00:49:16,876
- Hey, I got a full house.
- That's good, Lewis.

375
00:49:17,087 --> 00:49:18,999
Must be my lucky day.

376
00:51:41,690 --> 00:51:44,057
I think you're right about number 24.

377
00:51:44,276 --> 00:51:46,984
Increase the medication to 250 milligrams.

378
00:51:47,196 --> 00:51:49,404
- Same time?
- Mm-hmm.

379
00:52:04,968 --> 00:52:06,382
You!

380
00:52:09,927 --> 00:52:11,714
You broke my arm.

381
00:52:11,929 --> 00:52:14,512
There are 215 bones in the human body.

382
00:52:14,723 --> 00:52:17,261
That's one. Now, don't move.

383
00:52:23,273 --> 00:52:24,935
What are you gonna do?

384
00:52:28,570 --> 00:52:30,607
Why do we stop now?

385
00:52:31,949 --> 00:52:35,659
You gotta promise me
you're not gonna kill anyone, right?

386
00:52:35,869 --> 00:52:38,327
- Right.
- Swear?

387
00:52:38,539 --> 00:52:39,905
What?

388
00:52:40,124 --> 00:52:43,117
Just put up your hand and say,
"I swear I won't kill anyone."

389
00:52:44,294 --> 00:52:48,163
- I swear I will not kill anyone.
- All right. Let's go.

390
00:52:55,347 --> 00:52:59,091
Visiting hours is 10:00 to 4:00,
Monday through Friday.

391
00:53:03,397 --> 00:53:07,141
- What the hell are you doing?
- You son of a bitch! You shot me!

392
00:53:08,819 --> 00:53:10,276
You crazy bastard!

393
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,817
Don't shoot me again. Don't kill me.

394
00:53:20,622 --> 00:53:22,113
He'll live.

395
00:53:36,972 --> 00:53:38,964
Son of a bitch!

396
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:41,762
Let's try to remain calm.

397
00:53:41,977 --> 00:53:43,764
Open it, or he'll be dead
before he hits the floor.

398
00:53:43,979 --> 00:53:45,891
There's no way, Connor. Let him go.

399
00:53:46,106 --> 00:53:48,223
- Open the door.
- It ain't gonna happen.

400
00:53:48,442 --> 00:53:50,274
Take it easy, Sarah. Easy.

401
00:53:50,486 --> 00:53:52,102
It won't work, Sarah. You're no killer.

402
00:53:52,321 --> 00:53:53,653
I don't believe you can do it.

403
00:53:53,864 --> 00:53:55,105
You're already dead, Silberman.

404
00:53:55,324 --> 00:53:56,735
Everybody dies. You know I believe it.

405
00:53:56,950 --> 00:54:00,569
- So don't fuck with me!
- Open the door. Open the door.

406
00:54:06,877 --> 00:54:09,085
Back off!

407
00:54:09,296 --> 00:54:10,582
Get back!

408
00:54:10,798 --> 00:54:12,585
I'll pump him full of this shit. I swear!

409
00:54:14,468 --> 00:54:16,004
Don't move!

410
00:54:17,346 --> 00:54:20,305
- Drop the shit!
- Do it! Do it!

411
00:54:20,891 --> 00:54:23,178
Get in the office. On the floor, face down.

412
00:54:23,393 --> 00:54:24,474
Not you!

413
00:54:24,686 --> 00:54:26,177
Open the door.

414
00:54:29,191 --> 00:54:31,433
On the floor. Hold it open. Face the wall!

415
00:54:48,669 --> 00:54:50,160
Get her! Get her!

416
00:55:16,405 --> 00:55:17,941
Sarah!

417
00:55:18,156 --> 00:55:20,990
- Hurry up! Open the door!
- The door's locked!

418
00:55:21,994 --> 00:55:23,951
Let's go! Open it!

419
00:55:24,162 --> 00:55:24,948
Get the other door!

420
00:55:26,582 --> 00:55:28,414
- She broke it off.
- Open it!

421
00:55:33,964 --> 00:55:36,126
Let's go around! Come on! Move it!

422
00:56:01,533 --> 00:56:02,819
No!

423
00:56:03,035 --> 00:56:04,367
No!

424
00:56:06,455 --> 00:56:09,414
- No!
- Mom, wait!

425
00:56:09,625 --> 00:56:10,911
Mom!

426
00:56:16,548 --> 00:56:20,087
- Come back here!
- No! No!

427
00:56:20,719 --> 00:56:21,800
No!

428
00:56:22,012 --> 00:56:23,503
- Help her!
- Wait here.

429
00:56:23,722 --> 00:56:25,213
Hurry up!

430
00:56:25,432 --> 00:56:27,389
He'll kill us all! He'll kill us all!

431
00:56:27,601 --> 00:56:28,682
Hold her.

432
00:56:30,395 --> 00:56:31,931
He'll kill us all!

433
00:56:53,585 --> 00:56:55,827
Mom, are you okay? Mom!

434
00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:02,837
Come with me if you want to live.

435
00:57:03,053 --> 00:57:05,261
It's okay, Mom. He's here to help. It's okay.

436
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:31,196
Go.

437
00:58:03,697 --> 00:58:06,064
What the fuck is it?
What the fuck is going on?

438
00:58:21,006 --> 00:58:22,338
Get down.

439
00:58:38,940 --> 00:58:40,647
No! Mom!

440
00:58:58,794 --> 00:59:00,160
Out of the car!

441
00:59:01,713 --> 00:59:02,749
Right now!

442
00:59:27,572 --> 00:59:29,234
Go!

443
00:59:39,668 --> 00:59:40,704
I'm out.

444
00:59:47,676 --> 00:59:49,417
- Come on.
- Here.

445
00:59:52,139 --> 00:59:54,051
Reload.

446
01:00:03,150 --> 01:00:04,982
Last one!

447
01:00:12,117 --> 01:00:13,733
Hang on.

448
01:00:40,103 --> 01:00:41,344
Ready!

449
01:00:46,943 --> 01:00:48,275
John!

450
01:00:55,368 --> 01:00:56,984
Here, drive.

451
01:01:50,674 --> 01:01:52,666
He's not back there.
There's nobody behind us.

452
01:01:52,884 --> 01:01:55,046
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

453
01:01:57,305 --> 01:02:00,594
- Can you even see anything?
- I see everything.

454
01:02:03,770 --> 01:02:05,227
Cool.

455
01:02:08,984 --> 01:02:10,520
Come here.

456
01:02:16,658 --> 01:02:18,274
I said I was okay.

457
01:02:19,244 --> 01:02:22,203
John, it was stupid of you to go there.

458
01:02:23,331 --> 01:02:25,448
God damnit! You have to be smarter than that.

459
01:02:25,667 --> 01:02:27,124
You almost got yourself killed.

460
01:02:28,503 --> 01:02:30,085
What were you thinking?

461
01:02:31,131 --> 01:02:33,623
You cannot risk yourself, even for me.

462
01:02:33,842 --> 01:02:35,174
Do you understand?

463
01:02:35,385 --> 01:02:39,550
You're too important. Do you understand?

464
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:43,549
But...

465
01:02:45,395 --> 01:02:48,979
I had to get you out of that place.
I'm sorry.

466
01:02:50,358 --> 01:02:52,566
I didn't need your help.
I can take care of myself.

467
01:02:59,909 --> 01:03:01,400
What's wrong with your eyes?

468
01:03:03,580 --> 01:03:04,912
Nothing.

469
01:03:14,924 --> 01:03:17,211
So, what's your story?

470
01:03:27,812 --> 01:03:28,848
You okay?

471
01:03:29,064 --> 01:03:30,475
Fine.

472
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:35,484
Say, that's a nice bike.

473
01:03:57,509 --> 01:03:59,626
Hey! Watch it, lug nuts.

474
01:04:07,477 --> 01:04:10,436
Listen, do you know what you're doing?

475
01:04:10,647 --> 01:04:13,481
I have detailed files on human anatomy.

476
01:04:14,442 --> 01:04:19,403
I bet! Makes you
a more efficient killer, right?

477
01:04:19,614 --> 01:04:20,650
Correct.

478
01:04:26,996 --> 01:04:28,703
Does it hurt when you get shot?

479
01:04:30,041 --> 01:04:33,125
I sense injuries.
The data could be called "pain".

480
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:37,626
John, help me with the light.

481
01:04:37,841 --> 01:04:39,673
- Will these heal up?
- Yes.

482
01:04:39,884 --> 01:04:44,299
Good. If you can't pass for a human,
you're not much good to us.

483
01:04:44,514 --> 01:04:47,473
How long do you live? I mean, last. Whatever.

484
01:04:47,684 --> 01:04:50,347
120 years with my existing power cell.

485
01:04:50,562 --> 01:04:53,396
Can you learn stuff that
you haven't been programmed with,

486
01:04:53,606 --> 01:04:55,268
so you can be...

487
01:04:56,359 --> 01:05:00,854
...you know, more human,
and not such a dork all the time?

488
01:05:03,366 --> 01:05:06,950
My CPU is a neural net processor,
a learning computer.

489
01:05:07,162 --> 01:05:10,872
The more contact I have with humans,
the more I learn.

490
01:05:11,082 --> 01:05:12,698
Cool.

491
01:05:44,157 --> 01:05:45,648
Are we learning yet?

492
01:05:58,671 --> 01:06:01,630
We have to get as far away
from the city as possible.

493
01:06:05,553 --> 01:06:07,385
Just head south.

494
01:06:15,939 --> 01:06:17,396
Keep it under 65.

495
01:06:17,607 --> 01:06:20,224
- We don't wanna be pulled over.
- Affirmative.

496
01:06:21,069 --> 01:06:25,939
No, no, no. You gotta listen
to the way people talk.

497
01:06:26,157 --> 01:06:29,571
You don't say "affirmative"
or some shit like that.

498
01:06:29,786 --> 01:06:31,948
You say, <i>"No problemo."</i>

499
01:06:32,163 --> 01:06:35,952
And if someone comes up to you
with an attitude, you say, "Eat me!"

500
01:06:36,167 --> 01:06:40,286
And if you want to shine them on,
it's <i>"Hasta la vista,</i> baby."

501
01:06:41,172 --> 01:06:42,913
<i>Hasta la vista,</i> baby.

502
01:06:43,967 --> 01:06:45,674
Yeah, or "Later, dick-wad."

503
01:06:45,885 --> 01:06:48,673
And if someone gets upset,
you say, "Chill out."

504
01:06:48,888 --> 01:06:53,303
- Or you can do combinations.
- Chill out, dick-wad.

505
01:06:54,227 --> 01:06:56,139
That's great. See? You're getting it.

506
01:06:56,354 --> 01:06:58,266
<i>No problemo.</i>

507
01:07:12,996 --> 01:07:14,783
Want some of my fries?

508
01:07:25,091 --> 01:07:28,584
- Need any help?
- No.

509
01:07:28,803 --> 01:07:32,171
- I got you!
- No, you didn't!

510
01:07:32,390 --> 01:07:34,222
I did! I came round here and I got you!

511
01:07:34,434 --> 01:07:38,098
No, you didn't!

512
01:07:38,980 --> 01:07:41,097
We're not gonna make it, are we?

513
01:07:43,901 --> 01:07:45,142
People, I mean.

514
01:07:48,156 --> 01:07:50,148
It's in your nature to destroy yourselves.

515
01:07:51,326 --> 01:07:53,943
Yeah. Major drag, huh?

516
01:07:54,162 --> 01:07:57,030
Break it up before
I wring both of your necks.

517
01:07:59,167 --> 01:08:03,502
I need to know how Skynet gets built,
who's responsible.

518
01:08:03,713 --> 01:08:07,172
The man most directly responsible
is Miles Bennett Dyson.

519
01:08:08,092 --> 01:08:09,208
Who is that?

520
01:08:09,427 --> 01:08:12,545
He's the director of special projects
at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation.

521
01:08:15,850 --> 01:08:17,466
Why him?

522
01:08:17,685 --> 01:08:21,387
In a few months he creates
a revolutionary type of microprocessor.

523
01:08:22,148 --> 01:08:25,391
- Go on. Then what?
- In three years,

524
01:08:25,610 --> 01:08:29,020
Cyberdyne will become the largest supplier
of military computer systems.

525
01:08:30,031 --> 01:08:32,819
All Stealth bombers are upgraded
with Cyberdyne computers,

526
01:08:33,034 --> 01:08:34,366
becoming fully unmanned.

527
01:08:34,577 --> 01:08:37,695
Afterwards, they fly
with a perfect operational record.

528
01:08:37,914 --> 01:08:40,281
The Skynet Funding bill is passed.

529
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:43,789
The system goes on-line on August 4, 1997.

530
01:08:44,003 --> 01:08:46,916
Human decisions are removed
from strategic defence.

531
01:08:47,131 --> 01:08:49,839
Skynet begins to learn at a geometric rate.

532
01:08:50,051 --> 01:08:54,216
It becomes self-aware at 02:14am
Eastern time, August 29.

533
01:08:55,390 --> 01:08:57,723
In a panic, they try to pull the plug.

534
01:08:59,060 --> 01:09:01,268
- Skynet fights back.
- Yes.

535
01:09:01,479 --> 01:09:03,971
It launches its missiles
against the targets in Russia.

536
01:09:04,190 --> 01:09:07,228
Why attack Russia?
Aren't they our friends now?

537
01:09:07,443 --> 01:09:09,685
Because Skynet knows
that the Russian counterattack

538
01:09:09,904 --> 01:09:11,691
will eliminate its enemies over here.

539
01:09:11,906 --> 01:09:13,397
Jesus!

540
01:09:16,828 --> 01:09:17,989
How much do you know about Dyson?

541
01:09:20,248 --> 01:09:21,989
I have detailed files.

542
01:09:23,376 --> 01:09:25,117
I wanna know everything.

543
01:09:26,546 --> 01:09:30,506
What he looks like,
where he lives, everything.

544
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:00,736
Wait in the car.

545
01:10:19,307 --> 01:10:21,173
Enrique!

546
01:10:21,392 --> 01:10:23,725
Are you here?

547
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:40,492
You're pretty jumpy, Connor.

548
01:10:42,914 --> 01:10:44,509
And you...

549
01:10:46,409 --> 01:10:48,756
are always like a snake.

550
01:10:50,838 --> 01:10:52,830
It's great to see you, Connor!

551
01:10:53,049 --> 01:10:54,085
I told you I would be back.

552
01:10:54,300 --> 01:10:57,008
I knew you would. It's good to see you.

553
01:10:57,220 --> 01:10:58,051
Jolanda!

554
01:10:58,262 --> 01:11:01,471
Get out here, we got company.
And bring some tequila.

555
01:11:01,682 --> 01:11:04,800
- Hey, big John. <i>¿Cómo te va?</i>
- What's up?

556
01:11:05,019 --> 01:11:06,726
CONTINUES IN SPANISH) Who's this big guy?

557
01:11:06,938 --> 01:11:11,899
He's cool, Enrique.
He's with me. He's, er... Uncle Bob.

558
01:11:12,109 --> 01:11:13,941
Uncle Bob, this is Enrique.

559
01:11:14,153 --> 01:11:16,566
Uncle Bob, huh?

560
01:11:17,156 --> 01:11:19,648
Okay. Okay!

561
01:11:21,035 --> 01:11:22,116
How are you?

562
01:11:22,328 --> 01:11:25,617
How are you? You've grown so much.

563
01:11:25,832 --> 01:11:27,323
Drink?

564
01:11:31,629 --> 01:11:32,870
Uncle Bob?

565
01:11:33,965 --> 01:11:37,959
Hey, Sarita! You're pretty famous,
all over the goddamn TV.

566
01:11:38,177 --> 01:11:40,315
Pictures of you, John, your big friend here.

567
01:11:40,430 --> 01:11:43,138
Cops are going nuts looking for you.

568
01:11:46,561 --> 01:11:47,677
I just came for my stuff.

569
01:11:47,895 --> 01:11:50,353
I need clothes, food and one of your trucks.

570
01:11:50,565 --> 01:11:52,522
How about the fillings
out of my fucking teeth?

571
01:11:52,733 --> 01:11:55,225
Now, Enrique!

572
01:11:56,279 --> 01:12:00,068
- You two, you're on weapons detail.
- Come on. Let's go.

573
01:12:20,970 --> 01:12:23,383
One thing about my mom...

574
01:12:25,224 --> 01:12:27,341
...she always plans ahead.

575
01:12:37,904 --> 01:12:38,860
Excellent.

576
01:12:49,707 --> 01:12:53,246
This is my best truck I got,
but the starter motor's gone.

577
01:12:53,461 --> 01:12:55,248
You got time to change it out?

578
01:12:55,463 --> 01:12:58,501
Yeah. I'm gonna wait till dark
to cross the border.

579
01:13:01,177 --> 01:13:05,466
See, I grew up in places like this,
so I just thought that's how people lived,

580
01:13:05,681 --> 01:13:10,176
riding around in helicopters,
learning how to blow shit up.

581
01:13:15,066 --> 01:13:16,682
That's definitely you.

582
01:13:28,329 --> 01:13:30,912
Most of the guys my mom
hung around with were geeks,

583
01:13:31,123 --> 01:13:34,787
but there was this one guy,
he was kinda cool.

584
01:13:35,002 --> 01:13:38,166
- He taught me engines.
- Hold here.

585
01:13:39,131 --> 01:13:41,544
Mom screwed it up, of course.

586
01:13:41,759 --> 01:13:43,796
She'd always tell 'em about Judgment Day

587
01:13:44,011 --> 01:13:46,378
and me being this world leader.

588
01:13:47,181 --> 01:13:51,175
- That'd be all she wrote.
- Torque wrench, please.

589
01:13:53,604 --> 01:13:54,685
Here.

590
01:13:55,731 --> 01:14:00,146
- I wish I could've met my real dad.
- You will.

591
01:14:00,361 --> 01:14:04,947
Yeah, I guess. When I'm, like, 45, I think.

592
01:14:06,242 --> 01:14:09,406
I sent him back through time to 1984.

593
01:14:10,246 --> 01:14:11,487
Man!

594
01:14:13,207 --> 01:14:15,494
He hasn't even been born yet.

595
01:14:17,253 --> 01:14:19,210
It messes with your head.

596
01:14:21,841 --> 01:14:24,458
- The other bolt.
- Oh. Here.

597
01:14:31,434 --> 01:14:34,848
Mom and him were only together for one night.

598
01:14:35,062 --> 01:14:40,228
She still loves him, I guess.
I see her crying sometimes.

599
01:14:40,443 --> 01:14:44,857
She denies it totally, of course,
like she got something stuck in her eye.

600
01:14:49,118 --> 01:14:50,609
Why do you cry?

601
01:14:51,746 --> 01:14:53,533
- You mean people?
- Yeah.

602
01:14:53,748 --> 01:14:56,206
I don't know. We just cry.

603
01:14:57,168 --> 01:14:59,501
You know, when it hurts.

604
01:15:05,801 --> 01:15:10,796
- Pain causes it?
- Er... no. It's different.

605
01:15:11,015 --> 01:15:13,974
It's when there's nothing wrong
with you, but you hurt anyways.

606
01:15:14,185 --> 01:15:15,996
- Get it?
- No.

607
01:15:16,979 --> 01:15:18,561
All right, my man!

608
01:15:18,773 --> 01:15:21,982
<i>- No problemo.</i>
- Give me five.

609
01:15:24,528 --> 01:15:26,440
Just put out your hand, like this.

610
01:15:27,823 --> 01:15:31,533
All right! Now hit me.
Give me five. Do the same thing.

611
01:15:31,944 --> 01:15:33,581
All right!

612
01:15:36,707 --> 01:15:39,040
Okay, that's good. Up high! High five!

613
01:15:40,169 --> 01:15:41,285
Five low.

614
01:15:42,204 --> 01:15:43,695
Too slow.

615
01:15:46,175 --> 01:15:48,292
I'm just kidding. One more time.

616
01:15:48,511 --> 01:15:50,594
Good. Now try it. Good!

617
01:15:50,805 --> 01:15:52,546
Now do me. Give me five.

618
01:15:54,266 --> 01:15:56,258
'Watching John with the machine,

619
01:15:56,477 --> 01:15:58,639
it was suddenly so clear.

620
01:15:58,854 --> 01:16:01,813
'The Terminator would never stop.

621
01:16:02,024 --> 01:16:05,688
'It would never leave him
and it would never hurt him,

622
01:16:05,903 --> 01:16:09,317
'never shout at him or get drunk and hit him

623
01:16:09,532 --> 01:16:11,819
'or say it was too busy
to spend time with him.

624
01:16:12,868 --> 01:16:17,579
'It would always be there
and it would die to protect him.

625
01:16:19,333 --> 01:16:22,326
'Of all the would-be fathers
who came and went over the years,

626
01:16:22,545 --> 01:16:26,880
'this thing, this machine,
was the only one who measured up.

627
01:16:27,883 --> 01:16:32,298
'In an insane world,
it was the sanest choice.'

628
01:17:05,337 --> 01:17:10,173
Come here, darling.

629
01:18:09,944 --> 01:18:12,152
Hey, let's try this one.

630
01:18:17,534 --> 01:18:19,070
There we go.

631
01:20:05,309 --> 01:20:07,722
She said you go south
with him like you planned.

632
01:20:07,936 --> 01:20:10,929
- She'll meet you tomorrow.
- Mom!

633
01:20:11,148 --> 01:20:12,889
Mom, wait!

634
01:20:28,374 --> 01:20:30,081
"No fate".

635
01:20:31,418 --> 01:20:33,626
"No fate, but what we make."

636
01:20:35,798 --> 01:20:37,414
My father told her this.

637
01:20:40,427 --> 01:20:45,013
I mean, I made him memorise it
in the future as a message to her.

638
01:20:46,266 --> 01:20:51,432
Never mind.
Now, okay, the whole thing goes...

639
01:20:51,647 --> 01:20:54,264
The future's not set.

640
01:20:54,483 --> 01:20:57,897
There's no fate,
but what we make for ourselves.

641
01:20:58,112 --> 01:21:02,607
- She intends to change the future.
- Yeah, I guess.

642
01:21:04,076 --> 01:21:05,783
Oh, shit!

643
01:21:05,994 --> 01:21:07,781
- Dyson.
- Yeah.

644
01:21:07,996 --> 01:21:11,364
Gotta be. Miles Dyson.

645
01:21:11,583 --> 01:21:13,449
She's gonna blow him away.

646
01:21:13,669 --> 01:21:15,535
Come on! Let's go!

647
01:21:15,754 --> 01:21:17,416
Let's go! Come on!

648
01:21:28,183 --> 01:21:31,176
- This is tactically dangerous.
- Drive faster.

649
01:21:31,395 --> 01:21:35,139
The T-1000 has the same files
that I do. It knows what I know.

650
01:21:35,357 --> 01:21:39,852
- It might anticipate this move.
- I don't care. We gotta stop her.

651
01:21:40,070 --> 01:21:42,437
Killing Dyson might prevent the war.

652
01:21:42,656 --> 01:21:44,363
I don't care!

653
01:21:44,575 --> 01:21:46,362
Haven't you learned anything yet?

654
01:21:46,577 --> 01:21:48,739
Haven't you figured out
why you can't kill people?

655
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:57,373
Danny, I told you to go to bed.
I'm not kidding.

656
01:21:57,588 --> 01:22:00,831
Just a couple of minutes, Mom!

657
01:22:09,308 --> 01:22:11,516
Danny, your time is up!

658
01:22:11,727 --> 01:22:14,515
Come brush your teeth and get to bed.

659
01:22:43,258 --> 01:22:44,465
Danny!

660
01:22:56,230 --> 01:22:59,974
- Daddy!
- Danny, just go! Go, Danny! Go!

661
01:23:01,693 --> 01:23:02,729
Miles?

662
01:23:06,490 --> 01:23:07,901
Miles!

663
01:23:08,116 --> 01:23:10,403
- Tarissa, run!
- Oh, my God!

664
01:23:17,626 --> 01:23:19,538
Tarissa, just take Danny and go. Run!

665
01:23:19,753 --> 01:23:20,869
Run!

666
01:23:21,088 --> 01:23:22,704
Oh, Jesus! Miles!

667
01:23:42,067 --> 01:23:44,150
- Daddy!
- Danny! Danny!

668
01:23:44,361 --> 01:23:47,854
- Nobody fucking move!
- Don't hurt my daddy!

669
01:23:48,073 --> 01:23:51,737
Get down on the floor, bitch. Get down now!

670
01:23:51,952 --> 01:23:53,693
Get out of the way.

671
01:23:53,912 --> 01:23:55,494
Don't hurt him!

672
01:23:57,207 --> 01:23:58,743
Get on the floor now!

673
01:24:01,044 --> 01:24:03,502
Just let the boy go.

674
01:24:03,714 --> 01:24:06,548
Shut up. Shut up. Shut up! Shut up!

675
01:24:06,758 --> 01:24:09,216
It's all your fault, motherfucker.

676
01:24:09,428 --> 01:24:11,545
- It's all your fault!
- What?

677
01:24:11,763 --> 01:24:13,755
I'm not gonna let you do it.

678
01:24:32,409 --> 01:24:33,525
Shhh!

679
01:24:37,789 --> 01:24:38,996
Shhh.

680
01:25:05,859 --> 01:25:08,226
Shit! We're too late!

681
01:25:12,449 --> 01:25:13,439
Check them.

682
01:25:17,162 --> 01:25:20,655
Look at me, Mom. Are you hurt?

683
01:25:21,625 --> 01:25:23,161
Look at me.

684
01:25:25,170 --> 01:25:27,127
I almost...

685
01:25:27,339 --> 01:25:29,251
I almost...

686
01:25:39,059 --> 01:25:43,099
It'll be okay. It's gonna be okay.
We'll figure something out. Okay?

687
01:25:45,065 --> 01:25:46,397
I promise.

688
01:25:50,278 --> 01:25:55,444
- You came here to stop me.
- Yeah, I did.

689
01:25:58,537 --> 01:26:00,324
I love you, John.

690
01:26:02,249 --> 01:26:04,332
I always have.

691
01:26:05,794 --> 01:26:07,626
I know.

692
01:26:14,094 --> 01:26:16,131
Deep penetration.

693
01:26:17,889 --> 01:26:19,676
No shattered bone.

694
01:26:19,891 --> 01:26:22,679
You hold here. The pressure
should stop the bleeding.

695
01:26:33,613 --> 01:26:36,777
- Who are you people?
- Show him.

696
01:26:40,078 --> 01:26:44,118
Danny, I want you to come with me
right now. Show me your room.

697
01:26:57,179 --> 01:27:00,297
Oh, God! No!

698
01:27:12,778 --> 01:27:15,065
Oh, my God!

699
01:27:24,331 --> 01:27:25,822
Oh, my God.

700
01:27:26,041 --> 01:27:28,499
Now, listen to me very carefully.

701
01:27:30,921 --> 01:27:34,289
Nuclear winter effects
caused massive cooling...

702
01:27:34,508 --> 01:27:38,548
'Dyson listened while
the Terminator laid it all down.

703
01:27:38,762 --> 01:27:42,346
'Skynet. Judgment Day.

704
01:27:42,557 --> 01:27:45,595
'The history of things to come.

'It's not every day that you find out

706
01:27:52,067 --> 01:27:54,650
'He took it pretty well.'

707
01:27:56,071 --> 01:27:58,654
I feel like I'm gonna throw up.

708
01:28:05,163 --> 01:28:09,749
You're judging me
on things I haven't even done yet.

709
01:28:13,505 --> 01:28:16,122
How were we supposed to know?

710
01:28:18,218 --> 01:28:19,834
Yeah!

711
01:28:20,053 --> 01:28:21,544
Right.

712
01:28:22,472 --> 01:28:25,556
How were you supposed to know?

713
01:28:25,767 --> 01:28:29,351
Fucking men like you built the hydrogen bomb.

714
01:28:29,563 --> 01:28:33,773
Men like you thought it up.

715
01:28:37,571 --> 01:28:40,609
You think you're so creative.

716
01:28:40,824 --> 01:28:43,862
You don't know what it's like
to really create something,

717
01:28:44,077 --> 01:28:47,661
to create a life,
to feel it growing inside you.

718
01:28:47,873 --> 01:28:50,115
All you know how to create
is death and destruction.

719
01:28:50,333 --> 01:28:51,699
Mom!

720
01:28:52,669 --> 01:28:56,288
We need to be a little more
constructive here. Okay?

721
01:28:56,506 --> 01:28:58,463
We still have to stop this
from happening, don't we?

722
01:28:58,675 --> 01:29:00,382
But I thought...

723
01:29:01,595 --> 01:29:05,430
Aren't we changing things right now,
changing the way it goes?

724
01:29:05,640 --> 01:29:09,179
That's right. There's no way
I'm gonna finish the new processor.

725
01:29:09,394 --> 01:29:12,057
Not now. Forget it. I'm out of it.

726
01:29:12,272 --> 01:29:15,856
- I'll quit Cyberdyne tomorrow.
- That's not good enough.

727
01:29:16,067 --> 01:29:19,060
- No one must follow your work.
- Right.

728
01:29:20,155 --> 01:29:23,990
All right, then we have to destroy
all the stuff at the lab:

729
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:28,615
the files, the disk drives,
everything, everything here.

730
01:29:29,456 --> 01:29:32,290
Everything. I don't care.

731
01:29:34,294 --> 01:29:35,080
The chip.

732
01:29:35,712 --> 01:29:37,248
- Do you know about the chip?
- What chip?

733
01:29:37,464 --> 01:29:38,955
They keep it in a vault at Cyberdyne.

734
01:29:39,174 --> 01:29:40,415
It must be from the other one like you.

735
01:29:40,634 --> 01:29:45,004
- The CPU from the first Terminator.
- Son of a bitch! I knew it!

736
01:29:45,221 --> 01:29:47,804
They told us not to ask where they got it.

737
01:29:48,016 --> 01:29:50,224
Those lying motherfuckers.

738
01:29:50,435 --> 01:29:52,097
It's scary stuff. Radically advanced.

739
01:29:52,312 --> 01:29:56,014
I mean, it was smashed, it didn't work,
but it gave us ideas,

740
01:29:56,232 --> 01:29:59,100
took us in new directions,
things we would've never th...

741
01:30:01,363 --> 01:30:03,355
All my work was based on it.

742
01:30:03,573 --> 01:30:05,235
It must be destroyed.

743
01:30:07,577 --> 01:30:10,536
Can you get us in? Past security?

744
01:30:10,747 --> 01:30:13,660
I think so, yeah. When?

745
01:30:17,712 --> 01:30:18,668
Now?

746
01:30:22,926 --> 01:30:25,589
'The future, always so clear to me,

'We were in uncharted territory now,

749
01:31:09,931 --> 01:31:14,426
Hi. Er... Carl, right?

750
01:31:16,187 --> 01:31:18,019
Friends from out of town.
I just thought I'd...

751
01:31:18,440 --> 01:31:19,271
Hi!

752
01:31:19,691 --> 01:31:21,557
...take 'em upstairs and show 'em around.

753
01:31:21,776 --> 01:31:24,940
Mr Dyson, you know the rules
concerning visitors in the lab.

754
01:31:25,155 --> 01:31:27,147
I need written authorisation...

755
01:31:28,366 --> 01:31:32,076
- I insist.
- Don't even think about it.

756
01:31:43,048 --> 01:31:44,584
Come on. It's okay.

757
01:31:46,009 --> 01:31:49,176
It takes two keys to open the vault.
They have to be turned simultaneously.

758
01:31:49,387 --> 01:31:52,050
The other one is in a locker
at the security station.

759
01:31:53,683 --> 01:31:54,924
Gibbons?

760
01:31:58,188 --> 01:32:02,853
Gibbons! Come on, man!
You can't leave the desk like that!

761
01:32:05,153 --> 01:32:06,394
Gibbons!

762
01:32:07,906 --> 01:32:09,192
Oh, shit.

763
01:32:27,175 --> 01:32:29,212
My card should access this.

764
01:32:32,931 --> 01:32:35,048
- What? What is it?
- Damn it.

765
01:32:36,309 --> 01:32:38,096
The silent alarm's been tripped.

766
01:32:44,234 --> 01:32:47,022
It's neutralised all the codes
in the entire building.

767
01:32:47,237 --> 01:32:50,821
Nothing will open anywhere now.
We have to abort.

768
01:32:52,075 --> 01:32:53,486
No.

769
01:32:55,203 --> 01:32:58,367
We go all the way. Okay?

770
01:33:00,667 --> 01:33:04,331
You guys get started on the lab.
I can open this.

771
01:33:04,546 --> 01:33:05,957
I think it's that guy from the mall.

772
01:33:06,172 --> 01:33:07,083
It is!

773
01:33:07,298 --> 01:33:09,460
It's him and the woman.

774
01:33:10,802 --> 01:33:13,636
Look, just send everything
you got in the area right now.

775
01:33:16,224 --> 01:33:19,467
I have a personal entry code
for the lab. It may still work.

776
01:33:24,149 --> 01:33:26,311
- It's no good.
- Let me try mine.

777
01:33:31,573 --> 01:33:33,530
John, fire in the hold!

778
01:33:45,712 --> 01:33:50,377
Wait! You can't go in there.
The fire set off the halon system.

779
01:33:57,682 --> 01:34:00,015
You have to wait until the gas clears.

780
01:34:02,645 --> 01:34:03,761
Put this on.

781
01:34:18,036 --> 01:34:20,278
All right, let's get to work.

782
01:34:41,684 --> 01:34:44,722

- Remote control.

you have to...

- Ready.

- Take this. They'll use gas.
- Come on.

821
01:40:07,885 --> 01:40:10,844
Get started on the door.
Miles, hand me the detonator.

01:47:14,687 --> 01:47:18,476
Listen. No matter what happens,
you stay under these vests.

- You got it?
- Yeah.

- It's him.

Goddamn! You all right...

852
01:50:06,400 --> 01:50:08,357
Come on, Mom, we gotta get out.

853
01:50:10,863 --> 01:50:12,604
- Take the shotgun.
- Okay.

854
01:50:16,660 --> 01:50:17,867
Are you hurt?

855
01:50:30,716 --> 01:50:34,505
- Holy shit! Come on, Mom. Come on!
- We need your truck.

856
01:50:35,220 --> 01:50:36,051
Hurry!

857
01:50:41,226 --> 01:50:44,060
- Come on. Hurry.
- Get in.

858
01:50:44,813 --> 01:50:47,806
Come on! Go!

859
01:50:53,947 --> 01:50:55,813
What the hell...

860
01:51:02,289 --> 01:51:04,451
- I'm bleeding bad.
- Keep pressure on it.

861
01:51:06,460 --> 01:51:07,746
Here. This'll work.

862
01:51:14,051 --> 01:51:15,792
He's gaining.

863
01:51:17,763 --> 01:51:20,551
- Step on it!
- This is the vehicle's top speed.

864
01:51:20,766 --> 01:51:22,803
I can run faster than this!

865
01:51:33,153 --> 01:51:34,439
Coming up, to the right.

866
01:51:37,115 --> 01:51:38,447
Watch it! Watch it!

867
01:52:01,390 --> 01:52:03,131
- Drive a minute.
- Where the hell are you going?

868
01:52:11,024 --> 01:52:12,560
Take the off-ramp.

869
01:52:22,619 --> 01:52:23,405
Shit!

870
01:52:27,457 --> 01:52:28,322
Hold on!

871
01:53:14,338 --> 01:53:15,124
Don't stop!

872
01:53:23,889 --> 01:53:25,050
Go straight!

873
01:53:27,142 --> 01:53:28,599
- Look out!
- Duck!

874
01:53:43,867 --> 01:53:45,358
Get the hell outta here!

875
01:53:51,333 --> 01:53:53,996
Get outta here! Let's go!

876
01:55:11,204 --> 01:55:13,366
<i>Hasta la vista,</i> baby.

877
01:56:03,465 --> 01:56:04,421
We don't have much time.

878
01:56:27,531 --> 01:56:28,317
Let's go.

879
01:56:29,616 --> 01:56:31,152
Come on, Mom. We gotta get outta here.

880
01:56:31,368 --> 01:56:33,325
Come on! Get up!

881
01:56:47,217 --> 01:56:48,628
Hand me the shotgun.

882
01:56:53,598 --> 01:56:55,715
Put your weight on me, Mom.

883
01:56:56,810 --> 01:56:58,426
Hurry!

884
01:57:02,148 --> 01:57:03,639
Come on, Mom.

885
01:57:10,240 --> 01:57:12,448
- Agh!
- Come on, Mom. Get up! Come on!

886
01:57:27,632 --> 01:57:29,419
This way. Come on.

887
01:57:40,854 --> 01:57:43,392
Wait! No. No. It's too hot.

888
01:57:43,607 --> 01:57:44,723
Go back.

889
01:57:53,074 --> 01:57:55,191
- Go. Run.
- No! We gotta stick together.

890
01:57:55,827 --> 01:57:57,284
John, you've got to go now.

891
01:57:57,495 --> 01:57:59,487
- John!
- Go! Now!

892
01:57:59,706 --> 01:58:01,038
No!

893
01:59:14,322 --> 01:59:15,938
Get up the steps.

894
01:59:17,951 --> 01:59:19,112
Go on.

895
01:59:25,583 --> 01:59:27,575
Come on, Mom. I got you. Come on.

896
01:59:53,194 --> 01:59:53,980
No!

897
02:00:02,245 --> 02:00:04,453
Grab the chain. Grab it.

898
02:00:05,832 --> 02:00:08,449
Grab it. Go. Go!

899
02:00:19,095 --> 02:00:22,088
Mom, come on! Mom! Mom!

900
02:00:22,307 --> 02:00:23,764
Come on!

901
02:00:24,684 --> 02:00:26,266
Mom!

902
02:00:26,478 --> 02:00:28,640
Mom! Mom! Mom!

903
02:01:04,724 --> 02:01:06,135
Agh!

904
02:01:11,773 --> 02:01:12,684
Call to John.

905
02:01:14,692 --> 02:01:15,808
No!

906
02:01:16,361 --> 02:01:17,568
I know this hurts.

907
02:01:18,571 --> 02:01:21,029
- Ugh!
- Call John.

908
02:01:38,466 --> 02:01:40,378
Call to John now.

909
02:01:42,512 --> 02:01:43,798
Fuck you!

910
02:04:55,621 --> 02:04:59,160
John? John!

911
02:05:00,543 --> 02:05:02,751
John? Help!

912
02:05:05,506 --> 02:05:06,872
John!

913
02:05:10,678 --> 02:05:12,340
John?

914
02:05:14,682 --> 02:05:16,014
John!

915
02:05:18,144 --> 02:05:19,351
John.

916
02:05:20,313 --> 02:05:21,804
John.

917
02:05:24,400 --> 02:05:26,016
- Mom.
- Help me.

918
02:05:27,320 --> 02:05:29,061
Help me.

919
02:05:30,615 --> 02:05:31,605
Help me.

920
02:05:31,824 --> 02:05:32,940
Get out of the way, John.

921
02:05:33,159 --> 02:05:34,024
Shoot!

922
02:06:17,787 --> 02:06:19,198
Mom!

923
02:06:28,965 --> 02:06:30,422
Get down!

924
02:07:02,165 --> 02:07:03,622
No!

925
02:08:04,810 --> 02:08:07,018
Get up. Come on.

926
02:08:09,232 --> 02:08:10,768
Holy shit!

927
02:08:10,983 --> 02:08:12,645
I need a vacation.

928
02:08:27,166 --> 02:08:30,830
- Is it dead?
- Terminated.

929
02:08:34,382 --> 02:08:35,964
Will this melt in there?

930
02:08:39,220 --> 02:08:40,802
Yes. Throw it in.

931
02:08:45,685 --> 02:08:46,516
<i>Adiós!</i>

932
02:08:48,562 --> 02:08:50,724
And the chip.

933
02:09:05,204 --> 02:09:06,615
It's over.

934
02:09:09,166 --> 02:09:10,202
No.

935
02:09:13,754 --> 02:09:15,120
There's one more chip.

936
02:09:20,136 --> 02:09:22,093
And it must be destroyed also.

937
02:09:27,768 --> 02:09:29,134
Here.

938
02:09:29,353 --> 02:09:33,347
I cannot self-terminate.
You must lower me into the steel.

939
02:09:38,988 --> 02:09:40,524
No.

940
02:09:41,824 --> 02:09:42,610
No.

941
02:09:45,995 --> 02:09:48,362
- I'm sorry, John. I'm sorry.
- No!

942
02:09:48,581 --> 02:09:50,573
No, it'll be okay. Stay with us.

943
02:09:50,791 --> 02:09:52,657
- It'll be okay.
- I have to go away.

944
02:09:52,877 --> 02:09:55,335
No, don't do it. Please, don't go.

945
02:09:55,546 --> 02:09:58,289
- I must go away, John.
- No!

946
02:09:58,966 --> 02:10:00,047
No, wait.

947
02:10:00,259 --> 02:10:03,002
- You don't have to do this.
- I'm sorry.

948
02:10:04,180 --> 02:10:06,217
No, don't do it! Don't go!

949
02:10:06,482 --> 02:10:08,218
It has to end here.

950
02:10:09,560 --> 02:10:12,724
I order you not to go! I order you not to go!

951
02:10:12,938 --> 02:10:14,429
I order you not to go!

952
02:10:20,988 --> 02:10:22,729
I know now why you cry.

953
02:10:25,242 --> 02:10:27,404
But it's something I can never do.

954
02:11:02,530 --> 02:11:04,112
Goodbye.

955
02:12:43,464 --> 02:12:45,831
'The unknown future rolls toward us.

02:12:46,550 --> 02:12:49,884
