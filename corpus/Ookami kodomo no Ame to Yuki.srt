1
00:00:40,998 --> 00:00:45,998
People might laugh
and say it's just a fairy tale.

2
00:00:46,461 --> 00:00:51,461
That these mysterious things
couldn't really happen.

3
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:33,670
But this is the true story of my mother.

4
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:39,222
The man that Mother loved...

5
00:01:39,223 --> 00:01:44,223
...was a wolf man.

6
00:02:05,916 --> 00:02:10,916
Mother was a student at
a university just outside of Tokyo.

7
00:02:11,505 --> 00:02:16,505
--Her tuition was paid for with
scholarships --This is what Socrates said:

8
00:02:20,889 --> 00:02:25,889
..."The wise men of the world
may have great knowledge of many things--

9
00:02:28,939 --> 00:02:33,939
but goodness, truth, beauty, and arete..."

10
00:02:34,111 --> 00:02:35,695
One day in early summer,

11
00:02:35,696 --> 00:02:38,906
Mother saw Father for the
first time at the university.

12
00:02:38,907 --> 00:02:42,702
Wearing a shirt with a stretched-out
collar, using no textbook--

13
00:02:42,703 --> 00:02:46,038
Mother said he was completely
different from the other students

14
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:51,039
as she watched him
from behind earnestly taking notes.

15
00:03:11,064 --> 00:03:16,064
Please wait.

16
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:22,033
This is the attendance sheet. If you don't
turn it in, you'll be marked absent.

17
00:03:22,034 --> 00:03:23,993
--So--
--I'm...

18
00:03:23,994 --> 00:03:25,578
...not a student here.

19
00:03:25,579 --> 00:03:26,662
What?

20
00:03:26,663 --> 00:03:31,663
If that bothers you, I won't come anymore.

21
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,999
Please, wait!

22
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,877
I don't care if you are a student or not,

23
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:19,840
but the lecture can be hard
to understand without a textbook.

24
00:04:19,841 --> 00:04:24,841
Do you want to share mine?

25
00:04:31,353 --> 00:04:36,353
"Hokushin Dry Cleaners"

26
00:04:39,277 --> 00:04:44,277
Thank you for waiting.

27
00:05:36,626 --> 00:05:40,004
I'll put this here, then.

28
00:05:40,005 --> 00:05:45,005
I'll take this.

29
00:05:51,308 --> 00:05:54,018
Here, thank you.

30
00:05:54,019 --> 00:05:58,022
The accusers in this case
were the poet Meletus,

31
00:05:58,023 --> 00:06:03,023
the politically powerful Anytus,
and the sophist Lycon.

32
00:06:04,112 --> 00:06:06,197
Meletus acted as their representative,

33
00:06:06,198 --> 00:06:11,198
but Anytus is said to have
pulled the strings from behind.

34
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:36,977
What do you think is fun?
What kind of food do you like?

35
00:06:36,978 --> 00:06:41,978
What were the people you loved
in the past like?

36
00:06:42,234 --> 00:06:44,944
Why are you called "Hana"?

37
00:06:44,945 --> 00:06:46,111
My name?

38
00:06:46,112 --> 00:06:47,947
Yeah.

39
00:06:47,948 --> 00:06:52,243
When I was born,
cosmos were blooming in the garden.

40
00:06:52,244 --> 00:06:55,704
They hadn't been planted by anyone,
but grew there naturally.

41
00:06:55,705 --> 00:06:58,916
My dad said that looking at them
made him think of my name.

42
00:06:58,917 --> 00:07:02,878
He wanted me to be a child
who always smiled, like the flowers.

43
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:04,964
Even when things got hard,

44
00:07:04,965 --> 00:07:07,967
to just keep smiling,
even if the smile became forced.

45
00:07:07,968 --> 00:07:12,968
Because then I could
overcome most things, he said.

46
00:07:15,141 --> 00:07:19,853
That's why during Dad's funeral,
I was smiling the whole time.

47
00:07:19,854 --> 00:07:24,854
But then, my relatives said that was
improper, and they were very angry with me.

48
00:07:27,696 --> 00:07:32,283
But... I suppose
it really was improper, wasn't it?

49
00:07:32,284 --> 00:07:37,284
It wasn't improper.

50
00:07:37,414 --> 00:07:38,026
I'm glad.

"Hakujuji"

53
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:10,070
Even in the same housing complex,
each room is completely different inside.

54
00:08:10,071 --> 00:08:15,071
Families with money, poor families,
big families, people living alone,

55
00:08:17,162 --> 00:08:22,162
families with babies,
elderly living alone...

56
00:08:31,885 --> 00:08:34,970
I bet it'd be nice to have my own house.

57
00:08:34,971 --> 00:08:39,971
To say, "I'm home" and take off my shoes, wash
my face and hands, and sink into a chair.

58
00:08:42,187 --> 00:08:44,021
That'd be nice.

59
00:08:44,022 --> 00:08:45,606
I'd build a bookcase.

60
00:08:45,607 --> 00:08:49,610
And once that bookcase was full of books,
I'd build a new bookcase.

61
00:08:49,611 --> 00:08:54,611
I'd be able to do whatever I wanted
because it'd be my own house.

62
00:08:58,244 --> 00:09:03,244
Then, I'll say "Welcome home," if you want.

63
00:09:12,258 --> 00:09:13,926
Hana.

64
00:09:13,927 --> 00:09:16,011
What is it?

65
00:09:16,012 --> 00:09:19,515
There's something I have to tell you.

66
00:09:19,516 --> 00:09:21,392
You can tell me anything.

67
00:09:21,393 --> 00:09:26,393
Actually--

68
00:09:32,654 --> 00:09:34,530
I'll tell you tomorrow.

69
00:09:34,531 --> 00:09:35,031
Okay.

76
00:10:44,684 --> 00:10:48,187
I'm sorry, Hana.

77
00:10:48,188 --> 00:10:53,188
I'm sorry.

78
00:10:57,447 --> 00:11:00,908
I've never told anyone before.

79
00:11:00,909 --> 00:11:02,576
I was scared.

80
00:11:02,577 --> 00:11:07,577
I was afraid you'd leave if I told you,
but I should have told you sooner.

81
00:11:08,792 --> 00:11:11,210
I should have <i>shown</i> you.

82
00:11:11,211 --> 00:11:12,503
Shown me?

83
00:11:12,504 --> 00:11:17,504
Close your eyes for a second.

84
00:11:21,012 --> 00:11:26,012
For longer than that.

85
00:11:29,979 --> 00:11:34,979
Can I open them yet?

86
00:12:01,135 --> 00:12:04,054
Hana,

87
00:12:04,055 --> 00:12:09,055
what do I look like to you?

88
00:12:11,396 --> 00:12:13,897
She found out that
transforming during the full moon

89
00:12:13,898 --> 00:12:18,569
and attacking people was just a legend.

90
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:23,570
"The world is full of things
I don't know," Mother thought.

91
00:12:28,037 --> 00:12:30,581
Were you surprised?

92
00:12:30,582 --> 00:12:33,750
Will you leave me now?

93
00:12:33,751 --> 00:12:35,586
But you're shaking.

94
00:12:35,587 --> 00:12:37,045
Are you afraid?

95
00:12:37,046 --> 00:12:40,507
I'm not afraid.

96
00:12:40,508 --> 00:12:45,508
Because it's you.

97
00:12:54,105 --> 00:12:57,733
Father was a descendant
of the Honshuu wolf,

98
00:12:57,734 --> 00:13:00,903
which had become extinct
about a hundred years ago.

99
00:13:00,904 --> 00:13:05,904
With both wolf and human blood,
he was the last of his kind.

100
00:13:06,868 --> 00:13:11,868
When Father was a child, his parents told him
about the history of his extinct ancestors.

101
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:17,502
They told him not to reveal the truth
to anyone, and then died.

102
00:13:17,503 --> 00:13:20,923
After that, he was taken in
by relatives who knew nothing of this

103
00:13:20,924 --> 00:13:24,301
and had a hard time as
he grew into an adult.

104
00:13:24,302 --> 00:13:29,302
After getting his driver's license,
he went to the city to look for work.

105
00:13:29,432 --> 00:13:34,432
Unknown and unheeded by men, Father said
that he had lived in hiding until now.

106
00:15:38,686 --> 00:15:40,187
"Natural Birth: Kind to your body and soul"

107
00:15:40,188 --> 00:15:45,188
"Hakuiuji"

108
00:17:30,715 --> 00:17:35,302
Mother gave birth to me
in that small apartment.

109
00:17:35,303 --> 00:17:37,179
It was snowing.

110
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:40,640
Not at the hospital,
without even a midwife,

111
00:17:40,641 --> 00:17:43,143
my parents delivered me by themselves.

112
00:17:43,144 --> 00:17:46,396
Mother was worried that
if I had been born as a wolf,

113
00:17:46,397 --> 00:17:51,397
the doctors would have been surprised.

114
00:17:56,407 --> 00:17:59,117
I'm glad she was born safely.

115
00:17:59,118 --> 00:18:02,787
This is just the beginning.

116
00:18:02,788 --> 00:18:04,998
Do you think she will be a kind child?

117
00:18:04,999 --> 00:18:07,584
She might be a smart kid.

118
00:18:07,585 --> 00:18:10,003
I wonder what kind of adult she will be?

119
00:18:10,004 --> 00:18:13,340
A nurse, a teacher, or a baker--

120
00:18:13,341 --> 00:18:15,842
whatever it is, I want her
to have a job she loves.

121
00:18:15,843 --> 00:18:19,930
I want her to have a happy,
healthy life free of troubles.

122
00:18:19,931 --> 00:18:23,808
Let's watch over her until she grows up.

123
00:18:23,809 --> 00:18:24,309
Yeah.

124
00:18:40,826 --> 00:18:45,038
My little brother was born
in the spring of the next year.

125
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:48,291
It was raining that day.

126
00:18:48,292 --> 00:18:53,292
Suddenly, Father was nowhere to be seen.

127
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:44,010
I don't know what Father
was thinking that day.

128
00:19:44,307 --> 00:19:48,810
Maybe he instinctively went
to hunt for food for his new baby.

129
00:19:48,811 --> 00:19:51,229
Maybe he wanted
something nutritious for Mother,

130
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:56,230
who was recovering from the birth.

131
00:21:51,976 --> 00:21:56,438
"Driver's License"

132
00:21:56,439 --> 00:22:01,439
"I'm leaving the kids to you,"
Mother thought she could hear him say.

133
00:22:07,825 --> 00:22:12,825
Leave them to me.
I'll make sure to raise them properly.

134
00:22:22,965 --> 00:22:27,965
Mother had a lot of trouble with us after
that, but I don't remember anything about it.

135
00:22:28,512 --> 00:22:29,512
Num nums.

136
00:22:29,513 --> 00:22:32,098
Wait a minute, Yuki. I'm making it now.

137
00:22:32,099 --> 00:22:32,932
Num nums!

138
00:22:32,933 --> 00:22:34,017
I said, it's almost done.

139
00:22:34,018 --> 00:22:34,893
Num nums!

140
00:22:34,894 --> 00:22:37,979
Yuki!

141
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:39,856
When I was angry or upset,

142
00:22:39,857 --> 00:22:43,234
my fur would bristle,
and I would turn into a wolf.

143
00:22:43,235 --> 00:22:48,235
Oh all right, you can have a biscuit first.

144
00:22:53,704 --> 00:22:55,246
Apparently, I was always hungry,

145
00:22:55,247 --> 00:23:00,084
crying for food from morning until night.

146
00:23:00,085 --> 00:23:05,085
Completely different from
my sickly brother, Ame, who ate little.

147
00:23:06,091 --> 00:23:09,093
Mother had to quit school
and leave her part-time job

148
00:23:09,094 --> 00:23:12,931
in order to take care of us.

149
00:23:12,932 --> 00:23:15,183
That was close...

150
00:23:15,184 --> 00:23:20,184
We lived on the small savings
Father had left behind.

151
00:23:29,657 --> 00:23:31,908
That was close...

152
00:23:31,909 --> 00:23:36,496
According to Mother, my brother
and I seemed like we weren't sure

153
00:23:36,497 --> 00:23:41,497
if we were supposed to be humans or wolves.

154
00:23:46,507 --> 00:23:50,051
"Pediatric Care"

155
00:23:50,052 --> 00:23:54,180
They got me...

156
00:23:54,181 --> 00:23:58,309
"Child Care Encyclopedia"

157
00:23:58,310 --> 00:24:02,564
she had no choice but to study on her own.

158
00:24:02,565 --> 00:24:05,358
Breastfeeding every two
hours, day and night.

159
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:07,944
When Ame wouldn't suck on his own,

160
00:24:07,945 --> 00:24:12,945
she learned to feed him
with cotton pads dipped in breast milk.

161
00:24:22,293 --> 00:24:25,628
But when he wouldn't
drink any milk or stop crying,

162
00:24:25,629 --> 00:24:27,547
she didn't know what to do

163
00:24:27,548 --> 00:24:32,548
except pat him on the back
and comfort him the whole night.

164
00:24:33,596 --> 00:24:38,596
As a result, Mother was
quickly becoming exhausted.

165
00:24:44,064 --> 00:24:46,107
I'm okay.

166
00:24:46,108 --> 00:24:48,318
Thanks to this, even if it
was just for a short time,

167
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:53,319
she could fall asleep at a moment's notice.

168
00:24:53,449 --> 00:24:55,074
Mommy?

169
00:24:55,075 --> 00:24:59,495
What is it?

170
00:24:59,496 --> 00:25:02,874
What really caused problems
was when we got sick.

171
00:25:02,875 --> 00:25:05,918
Yuki?

172
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:07,629
Yuki?

173
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:08,130
Yuki--!

174
00:25:19,058 --> 00:25:23,478
The pediatrician or the veterinarian--
she didn't know which one to take us to.

175
00:25:23,479 --> 00:25:26,939
My daughter swallowed
some desiccant by mistake--

176
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,191
She's two years old.

177
00:25:28,192 --> 00:25:31,694
Yes, she threw up.
There was no blood.

178
00:25:31,695 --> 00:25:36,695
It says "silica gel" on it.
Um, is it dangerous...?

179
00:25:37,117 --> 00:25:40,203
What? Her appetite?

180
00:25:40,204 --> 00:25:43,122
I'm hungry!

181
00:25:43,123 --> 00:25:46,626
Is that so? She's okay?

182
00:25:46,627 --> 00:25:51,627
She regretted not asking Father
about how he was raised as a child.

183
00:25:52,883 --> 00:25:53,841
I wanna go for a walk.

184
00:25:53,842 --> 00:25:54,842
Yuki, that's--

185
00:25:54,843 --> 00:25:55,927
Walk!

186
00:25:55,928 --> 00:25:59,138
You were sick just a little while ago. So--

187
00:25:59,139 --> 00:26:00,056
Walk!

188
00:26:00,057 --> 00:26:05,057
Okay, okay.
Now, put your ears away.

189
00:26:06,689 --> 00:26:10,149
Okay, let's go for a walk!

190
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:14,737
I said, put your ears away!

191
00:26:14,738 --> 00:26:15,238
Okay!

192
00:26:36,301 --> 00:26:38,302
Hello. Aw, how cute.

193
00:26:38,303 --> 00:26:43,303
He said you're cute. Isn't that nice?

194
00:26:45,227 --> 00:26:46,602
Oh, sorry!

195
00:26:46,603 --> 00:26:51,603
It's okay.

196
00:26:55,404 --> 00:27:00,404
But that wasn't the only problem.

197
00:27:04,455 --> 00:27:08,875
What time do you think it is?!
Shut him up!

198
00:27:08,876 --> 00:27:09,792
I'm very sorry.

199
00:27:09,793 --> 00:27:12,920
You keep making such
a racket night after night!

200
00:27:12,921 --> 00:27:14,797
I'm really very sorry.

201
00:27:14,798 --> 00:27:19,798
At least discipline your kids properly--!

202
00:27:20,179 --> 00:27:25,179
Shh... It's okay.

203
00:27:42,534 --> 00:27:47,079
The contract said pets
are not allowed here, didn't it?

204
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,164
I don't have any pets.

205
00:27:48,165 --> 00:27:51,834
Don't lie to me.
I know what's going on.

206
00:27:51,835 --> 00:27:54,003
If you think you can do whatever you want,

207
00:27:54,004 --> 00:27:59,004
then I'll have no choice
but to have you go elsewhere.

208
00:28:00,761 --> 00:28:02,136
You're caseworkers?

209
00:28:02,137 --> 00:28:06,599
Yes, we have some serious
misgivings about your children.

210
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,392
What do you mean?

211
00:28:08,393 --> 00:28:13,393
Our records show that they've
never had regular checkups or vaccines.

212
00:28:14,066 --> 00:28:16,776
It's all right. They're healthy.

213
00:28:16,777 --> 00:28:20,780
If that's the case, can
we at least see them?

214
00:28:20,781 --> 00:28:22,031
No, that's--

215
00:28:22,032 --> 00:28:23,157
Just a look will do.

216
00:28:23,158 --> 00:28:26,494
We just want to see if
what you're saying is true or not.

217
00:28:26,495 --> 00:28:28,037
You're not welcome--

218
00:28:28,038 --> 00:28:32,166
If you don't let us in, you could
be suspected of abuse or neglect!

219
00:28:32,167 --> 00:28:37,167
Please, leave!

220
00:29:14,751 --> 00:29:16,544
Hey--

221
00:29:16,545 --> 00:29:18,337
What is it, Mommy?

222
00:29:18,338 --> 00:29:21,007
What do you want to do from now on?

223
00:29:21,008 --> 00:29:24,135
Do you want to be human, or wolf?

224
00:29:24,136 --> 00:29:27,763
Huh?

225
00:29:27,764 --> 00:29:31,142
I'm thinking of moving.

226
00:29:31,143 --> 00:29:36,143
So that you can choose
whichever one you want.

227
00:29:53,332 --> 00:29:55,833
Ever since the town hall
started presenting unoccupied houses,

228
00:29:55,834 --> 00:29:59,045
people who want to live
in the country have been coming steadily,

229
00:29:59,046 --> 00:30:01,297
but they never last long.

230
00:30:01,298 --> 00:30:03,883
As you can see, there's nothing here.

231
00:30:03,884 --> 00:30:06,677
The elementary school and hospital
are both thirty minutes away by car.

232
00:30:06,678 --> 00:30:10,264
The junior high is two and a half hours
by bus and train, one way.

233
00:30:10,265 --> 00:30:11,849
That's five hours round trip!

234
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:16,850
No matter how much you want to raise
your children in a good environment--

235
00:30:17,189 --> 00:30:22,189
The town is a lot more convenient,
in my opinion.

236
00:30:34,122 --> 00:30:36,290
Wow...

237
00:30:36,291 --> 00:30:38,334
It's so big...

238
00:30:38,335 --> 00:30:41,170
And I know the rent is practically free,

239
00:30:41,171 --> 00:30:43,839
but you know, the cost of repairs
is nothing to laugh at.

240
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:48,135
Instead of calling it an unoccupied house--
oh, you can keep your shoes on--

241
00:30:48,136 --> 00:30:51,639
--it's more like an abandoned house.

242
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:56,310
But at least there's electricity,
and the mountain stream isn't dried out,

243
00:30:56,311 --> 00:30:58,187
and they said you could use
whatever is in the shed.

244
00:30:58,188 --> 00:31:00,064
That's a field, isn't it?

245
00:31:00,065 --> 00:31:02,984
Oh, this place isn't really suitable
for growing your own food.

246
00:31:02,985 --> 00:31:06,112
Animals come down from the mountains
and damage the crops.

247
00:31:06,113 --> 00:31:09,240
Even if you make the effort
to grow vegetables, they'll all get eaten.

248
00:31:09,241 --> 00:31:13,536
This place is full of unoccupied houses
because the humans are getting kicked out.

249
00:31:13,537 --> 00:31:15,329
Then, the neighbors are--?

250
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:20,330
Neighbors? There isn't anyone around for miles.
Shall we look at a different place?

251
00:31:21,878 --> 00:31:23,671
There might be a better
place near the village...

252
00:31:23,672 --> 00:31:24,588
I've decided.

253
00:31:24,589 --> 00:31:25,631
What?

254
00:31:25,632 --> 00:31:29,051
I've decided on this place.

255
00:31:29,052 --> 00:31:29,927
Why?

256
00:31:29,928 --> 00:31:32,179
Wow! What is this place?

257
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:37,180
Our new home.

258
00:31:44,067 --> 00:31:44,900
Oopsie daisy!

259
00:31:44,901 --> 00:31:49,901
It's slanted!

260
00:31:50,407 --> 00:31:54,326
Oh, hello Mr. Ant!

261
00:31:54,327 --> 00:31:59,327
Wow, what's this?!

262
00:32:02,461 --> 00:32:07,461
Stomp! Stomp!

263
00:32:15,098 --> 00:32:17,308
How is it? Do you like it?

264
00:32:17,309 --> 00:32:19,268
I like it!

265
00:32:19,269 --> 00:32:24,269
I want to go home.

266
00:32:27,819 --> 00:32:31,363
She said she wanted a place
with no neighbors close by.

267
00:32:31,364 --> 00:32:33,908
She was a little different,
if you know what I mean.

268
00:32:33,909 --> 00:32:34,825
What about her husband?

269
00:32:34,826 --> 00:32:35,576
I don't know...

270
00:32:35,577 --> 00:32:36,660
Her income?

271
00:32:36,661 --> 00:32:37,453
I'm not sure...

272
00:32:37,454 --> 00:32:40,122
Then how does she expect
to take care of her kids?

273
00:32:40,123 --> 00:32:45,123
Oh, Grandpa Nirasaki!
We'll be in your care from now on.

274
00:33:37,973 --> 00:33:40,141
Look, look! Mommy, look!

275
00:33:40,142 --> 00:33:40,642
Tada--!

276
00:33:46,314 --> 00:33:48,816
Come here, birdie--

277
00:33:48,817 --> 00:33:53,817
C'mon, come here--

278
00:34:14,593 --> 00:34:19,593
"Yuki - Age 5"
"Ame - Age 4"

279
00:34:53,924 --> 00:34:55,507
Thank you very much.

280
00:34:55,508 --> 00:35:00,508
Thank you.

281
00:35:02,307 --> 00:35:03,682
Good evening.

282
00:35:03,683 --> 00:35:06,435
Good evening.

283
00:35:06,436 --> 00:35:11,436
Hey, wait, is that her?

284
00:35:16,696 --> 00:35:21,696
Let's go--

285
00:35:31,836 --> 00:35:34,797
Smash!

286
00:35:34,798 --> 00:35:37,174
I guess we'll have to be
more frugal from now on.

287
00:35:37,175 --> 00:35:38,926
Frugal?

288
00:35:38,927 --> 00:35:43,927
I was just thinking that we should at least
be able to grow our own vegetables.

289
00:35:44,516 --> 00:35:47,935
I'll help!

290
00:35:47,936 --> 00:35:49,103
Wait here, okay?

291
00:35:49,104 --> 00:35:51,772
Okay.

292
00:35:51,773 --> 00:35:55,025
"Home Garden"

293
00:35:55,026 --> 00:35:55,901
These please.

294
00:35:55,902 --> 00:35:57,069
Okay.

295
00:35:57,070 --> 00:36:02,070
These, too.

296
00:36:02,367 --> 00:36:06,912
It's our little secret that
you two are wolf children.

297
00:36:06,913 --> 00:36:08,038
Right.

298
00:36:08,039 --> 00:36:12,126
If you were to suddenly become wolves,
everyone would be very surprised.

299
00:36:12,127 --> 00:36:15,421
So you cannot become wolves
in front of other people.

300
00:36:15,422 --> 00:36:16,880
Promise?

301
00:36:16,881 --> 00:36:18,424
Promise!

302
00:36:18,425 --> 00:36:20,217
And one more thing.

303
00:36:20,218 --> 00:36:24,054
If you meet other animals in the mountains,
you can't act like you are better than them.

304
00:36:24,055 --> 00:36:25,431
Why not?

305
00:36:25,432 --> 00:36:27,933
Because Daddy will feel sad about it.

306
00:36:27,934 --> 00:36:29,601
Okay?

307
00:36:29,602 --> 00:36:31,520
Okay!

308
00:36:31,521 --> 00:36:33,564
"'We'll never forgive you!' The angry
villagers chased after the wolf with guns."

309
00:36:33,565 --> 00:36:38,565
"'I'm sorry! I won't do it again, '
the boastful wolf cried as he ran away."

310
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:04,511
Oh no!

311
00:37:04,512 --> 00:37:05,637
Why?

312
00:37:05,638 --> 00:37:10,638
I don't know. I wonder what happened...

313
00:37:11,019 --> 00:37:13,228
Hello? Excuse me!

314
00:37:13,229 --> 00:37:14,563
What?

315
00:37:14,564 --> 00:37:17,816
Is it okay if I take
the fallen leaves from the woods?

316
00:37:17,817 --> 00:37:19,568
What did you say?

317
00:37:19,569 --> 00:37:21,195
The fallen leaves!

318
00:37:21,196 --> 00:37:24,907
No one would ask
for permission to take that stuff!

319
00:37:24,908 --> 00:37:29,078
Thank you very much!

320
00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:30,704
I wonder how long she'll last.

321
00:37:30,705 --> 00:37:34,833
She'll start talking about convenience
stores and karaoke soon enough.

322
00:37:34,834 --> 00:37:39,834
You got that right.

323
00:37:50,183 --> 00:37:52,059
I'll get it right this time...

324
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:53,852
Mom... my...

325
00:37:53,853 --> 00:37:55,437
What?

326
00:37:55,438 --> 00:37:56,230
Ame!

327
00:37:56,231 --> 00:37:57,356
What happened?

328
00:37:57,357 --> 00:37:58,607
You calico cat!

329
00:37:58,608 --> 00:38:01,652
You're weak even though you're a wolf,
so they've got it in for you.

330
00:38:01,653 --> 00:38:03,695
They're just scratches.
Nothing to worry about.

331
00:38:03,696 --> 00:38:05,489
You won't be able to survive like that!

332
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:06,323
Yuki.

333
00:38:06,324 --> 00:38:08,450
Do the "all better" thing.

334
00:38:08,451 --> 00:38:10,160
All better, all better.

335
00:38:10,161 --> 00:38:12,788
I wouldn't lose to a wild boar!

336
00:38:12,789 --> 00:38:13,997
You saw a wild boar?

337
00:38:13,998 --> 00:38:18,335
Yup, and a monkey and a serow.
But I wasn't scared at all.

338
00:38:18,336 --> 00:38:20,838
It was fun when they ran away
when I chased them.

339
00:38:20,839 --> 00:38:21,505
And--

340
00:38:21,506 --> 00:38:22,673
Yuki.

341
00:38:22,674 --> 00:38:24,508
And then when I peed--

342
00:38:24,509 --> 00:38:25,884
Do you remember your promise?

343
00:38:25,885 --> 00:38:28,720
That you wouldn't act like
you were better than the other animals?

344
00:38:28,721 --> 00:38:29,513
But--

345
00:38:29,514 --> 00:38:33,142
Please.

346
00:38:33,143 --> 00:38:36,019
Fine.

347
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:36,895
Thank you.

348
00:38:36,896 --> 00:38:40,858
Do the "all better" thing again.

349
00:38:40,859 --> 00:38:45,362
All better, all better.

350
00:38:45,363 --> 00:38:50,363
But, how do wolf children
become adults, anyway?

351
00:38:54,706 --> 00:38:56,331
Yuki, wait!

352
00:38:56,332 --> 00:38:57,332
Piggyback.

353
00:38:57,333 --> 00:38:58,417
Already?

354
00:38:58,418 --> 00:39:01,628
You're too slow! Hurry up!

355
00:39:01,629 --> 00:39:06,091
"Wolves start learning to hunt
at around four months old.

356
00:39:06,092 --> 00:39:09,595
First, they learn what hunting is
with mice and other small animals.

357
00:39:09,596 --> 00:39:13,098
As they get older,
they form teams with adult wolves..."

358
00:39:13,099 --> 00:39:13,849
We're a team!

359
00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:15,184
No, we're not.

360
00:39:15,185 --> 00:39:20,063
Fine, be that way.

361
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:21,899
Don't go too far!

362
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:24,693
I know!

363
00:39:24,694 --> 00:39:26,236
Let's go home...

364
00:39:26,237 --> 00:39:31,237
Ame, I wonder if this
wild grass is edible... Let's see...

365
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:48,162
I got it!

366
00:39:55,433 --> 00:39:55,933
Got it!

367
00:40:02,607 --> 00:40:07,607
Oh, look at that, Ame!

368
00:40:14,118 --> 00:40:16,245
All better, all better.

369
00:40:16,246 --> 00:40:20,457
Mommy, look at this! It's a cormorant!
There was a stream over there, and...

370
00:40:20,458 --> 00:40:23,001
Shh...

371
00:40:23,002 --> 00:40:24,044
Mommy...

372
00:40:24,045 --> 00:40:25,420
Hmm?

373
00:40:25,421 --> 00:40:29,216
Why is the wolf always the bad guy?

374
00:40:29,217 --> 00:40:32,344
You mean, in the picture books?

375
00:40:32,345 --> 00:40:36,682
Everyone hates them,
and they're always killed in the end...

376
00:40:36,683 --> 00:40:41,683
If that's the case,
I don't want to be a wolf.

377
00:40:43,439 --> 00:40:48,439
You're right. But you know,
Mommy likes wolves.

378
00:40:49,612 --> 00:40:54,612
Even if everyone else hates the wolf,
I'll take the wolf's side.

379
00:41:03,876 --> 00:41:07,421
Mommy! Mommy!

380
00:41:07,422 --> 00:41:08,422
What's wrong?

381
00:41:08,423 --> 00:41:09,631
They wilted again.

382
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:10,132
What?

383
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:19,641
Diseased... All of them? Don't tell me...

384
00:41:19,642 --> 00:41:21,852
Mommy...

385
00:41:21,853 --> 00:41:26,853
What's going to happen to us now?

386
00:41:28,985 --> 00:41:32,821
Mommy's no good like this.
I've got to learn more!

387
00:41:32,822 --> 00:41:35,741
Will you help me again?

388
00:41:35,742 --> 00:41:37,117
Sure.

389
00:41:37,118 --> 00:41:37,618
Thanks.

390
00:41:41,873 --> 00:41:42,873
Go inside.

391
00:41:42,874 --> 00:41:44,875
Okay.

392
00:41:44,876 --> 00:41:46,585
Hello!

393
00:41:46,586 --> 00:41:50,797
I was going to visit earlier,
but it got so busy around here...

394
00:41:50,798 --> 00:41:53,800
It's hard to grow your own food, isn't it?

395
00:41:53,801 --> 00:41:57,304
Even when I do what it says in the book,
I keep messing up.

396
00:41:57,305 --> 00:42:01,558
But this is a nice place, isn't it?
With nature all around us.

397
00:42:01,559 --> 00:42:03,310
Nature, ha!

398
00:42:03,311 --> 00:42:06,438
Plants don't grow overnight, you know.

399
00:42:06,439 --> 00:42:07,439
Huh?

400
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:10,275
At this rate, it'll be the same
no matter how many times you try.

401
00:42:10,276 --> 00:42:12,110
Isn't that what you think?

402
00:42:12,111 --> 00:42:14,196
T-That's...

403
00:42:14,197 --> 00:42:17,366
Don't smile! Why do you smile?

404
00:42:17,367 --> 00:42:22,367
Even if you smile,
you won't be able to do anything.

405
00:42:35,468 --> 00:42:38,178
That person's scary.

406
00:42:38,179 --> 00:42:42,641
No, it's Mommy's fault
for not knowing anything.

407
00:42:42,642 --> 00:42:46,978
Even though you're an adult?

408
00:42:46,979 --> 00:42:51,979
I should have asked
your Daddy about more things.

409
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:04,079
It's raining cats and dogs!

410
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:05,580
Hello...

411
00:43:05,581 --> 00:43:06,873
Um...

412
00:43:06,874 --> 00:43:08,500
Here, this is for you.

413
00:43:08,501 --> 00:43:09,584
What are they?

414
00:43:09,585 --> 00:43:11,044
Seed potatoes.

415
00:43:11,045 --> 00:43:14,548
You mean the ones you plant in the fields?

416
00:43:14,549 --> 00:43:17,509
Is there anything else
you can do with them?

417
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:21,513
Don't worry about what Dad said.
That's just how he is.

418
00:43:21,514 --> 00:43:26,184
No, it was my fault.

419
00:43:26,185 --> 00:43:29,104
Hello!

420
00:43:29,105 --> 00:43:30,397
Sorry.

421
00:43:30,398 --> 00:43:33,316
Don't worry about it.

422
00:43:33,317 --> 00:43:33,817
Here.

423
00:43:40,533 --> 00:43:44,619
Grandpa Nirasaki,
thank you for the seed potatoes.

424
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:49,620
Ah, are you trying to let them go to waste?

425
00:43:53,796 --> 00:43:58,796
You have to start over from the soil.

426
00:44:03,681 --> 00:44:06,141
You won't get anything
done hoeing like that.

427
00:44:06,142 --> 00:44:11,142
I'm sorry...

428
00:44:17,779 --> 00:44:19,738
Um, what about the fertilizer...?

429
00:44:19,739 --> 00:44:21,656
Did you use leaves when
you prepared the soil?

430
00:44:21,657 --> 00:44:22,407
Yes.

431
00:44:22,408 --> 00:44:27,408
Then you don't need fertilizer.

432
00:44:34,003 --> 00:44:36,338
When you're done, clear this field, too.

433
00:44:36,339 --> 00:44:41,339
I don't need such a big field. I just
need to grow enough for my kids and me.

434
00:44:43,513 --> 00:44:48,266
Did you hear me?

435
00:44:48,267 --> 00:44:48,767
Yes...

436
00:45:10,790 --> 00:45:14,501
Make ridges in the soil.

437
00:45:14,502 --> 00:45:18,255
Okay.

438
00:45:18,256 --> 00:45:20,382
Leave more space in between.

439
00:45:20,383 --> 00:45:24,010
Okay.

440
00:45:24,011 --> 00:45:26,054
That's too low. Make them higher.

441
00:45:26,055 --> 00:45:26,555
Okay.

442
00:46:07,513 --> 00:46:12,513
In a week, plant them cut-side down.
Don't water them. Just leave them!

443
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:19,520
Um, thank you for teaching me how to...

444
00:46:35,541 --> 00:46:40,541
Mommy, are you okay?

445
00:46:45,676 --> 00:46:49,095
Ow...

446
00:46:49,096 --> 00:46:50,388
Hello!

447
00:46:50,389 --> 00:46:51,598
Come with us.

448
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:52,140
Huh?

449
00:46:52,141 --> 00:46:54,142
It's okay, just come.

450
00:46:54,143 --> 00:46:54,559
What?

451
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:59,560
Come on, let's go.

452
00:47:01,150 --> 00:47:02,359
Hey--

453
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:03,985
Yes?

454
00:47:03,986 --> 00:47:05,904
If you plant chamomile
and cabbage together,

455
00:47:05,905 --> 00:47:08,448
bugs won't attack
and the flavors will be better.

456
00:47:08,449 --> 00:47:11,576
No, you want celery with your cabbage.

457
00:47:11,577 --> 00:47:14,162
No, no, it's better for
novices to use this.

458
00:47:14,163 --> 00:47:15,372
NO, no! no!

459
00:47:15,373 --> 00:47:18,124
You can't fill up a stomach on chamomile.

460
00:47:18,125 --> 00:47:20,877
You should plant them shallowly like this.

461
00:47:20,878 --> 00:47:23,880
No, you should water the hole
before you put anything in.

462
00:47:23,881 --> 00:47:27,092
No, no, you can water them later.
Plant them first.

463
00:47:27,093 --> 00:47:28,843
No, no, you're wrong.

464
00:47:28,844 --> 00:47:31,221
You should just sprinkle
the extra fertilizer like this.

465
00:47:31,222 --> 00:47:33,598
If you put too much,
it'll just bring more bugs.

466
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:36,309
No, give me that. You have to pile it on.

467
00:47:36,310 --> 00:47:38,478
No, you only need a little.

468
00:47:38,479 --> 00:47:40,814
If you do what this guy says,
you'll definitely fail.

469
00:47:40,815 --> 00:47:41,690
That's you!

470
00:47:41,691 --> 00:47:42,482
What?!

471
00:47:42,483 --> 00:47:45,443
What did you say?!

472
00:47:45,444 --> 00:47:46,903
Wood vinegar?

473
00:47:46,904 --> 00:47:49,239
It's made from the smoke
when charcoal is produced.

474
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:51,992
And poultry manure.
There are instructions inside.

475
00:47:51,993 --> 00:47:54,077
Thank you for coming all this way to help.

476
00:47:54,078 --> 00:47:55,120
No, no.

477
00:47:55,121 --> 00:47:57,831
Sorry about showing up
without warning like this.

478
00:47:57,832 --> 00:47:58,707
It's no problem.

479
00:47:58,708 --> 00:48:01,167
It's hard working the land
if you're not used to it, isn't it?

480
00:48:01,168 --> 00:48:04,170
I still have a lot I have to learn.

481
00:48:04,171 --> 00:48:06,089
There are a lot of city folks
who get discouraged

482
00:48:06,090 --> 00:48:08,550
and leave right after moving here.

483
00:48:08,551 --> 00:48:10,093
Other young people...?

484
00:48:10,094 --> 00:48:15,094
Oh no, these were retired old men. It was
hilarious how weak they were mentally.

485
00:48:18,310 --> 00:48:23,310
I don't know if it means anything if I say it, but
this isn't an easy place to live off the land.

486
00:48:23,315 --> 00:48:24,941
The drainage isn't very good.

487
00:48:24,942 --> 00:48:26,651
And we get a lot of snow.

488
00:48:26,652 --> 00:48:31,239
We have to help each other.

489
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:34,117
We thought you didn't want
anything to do with the neighbors.

490
00:48:34,118 --> 00:48:38,747
There are only a few young mothers around,
so it's nice to have someone else around.

491
00:48:38,748 --> 00:48:40,165
Let us know if you have any questions.

492
00:48:40,166 --> 00:48:42,375
Then“.

493
00:48:42,376 --> 00:48:44,794
What? You're living off your savings?

494
00:48:44,795 --> 00:48:46,796
But I need to start working soon.

495
00:48:46,797 --> 00:48:49,799
It's hard to find work around here.

496
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:53,636
Everyone leaves their kids
at the preschool and commutes to work.

497
00:48:53,637 --> 00:48:55,972
Right?

498
00:48:55,973 --> 00:48:57,974
What's a preschool?

499
00:48:57,975 --> 00:48:58,558
What?

500
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:00,518
Why don't Ame and I go?

501
00:49:00,519 --> 00:49:03,354
--Well, that's because...
--I want to go to preschool, too!

502
00:49:03,355 --> 00:49:03,897
No.

503
00:49:03,898 --> 00:49:04,481
I wanna go!

504
00:49:04,482 --> 00:49:05,023
No!

505
00:49:05,024 --> 00:49:10,024
I wanna go I wanna go I wanna go...!

506
00:49:10,863 --> 00:49:12,030
I wanna go!

507
00:49:12,031 --> 00:49:16,034
I wanna go to the preschool...!

508
00:49:16,035 --> 00:49:18,161
Yuki, hurry up and finish your food.

509
00:49:18,162 --> 00:49:20,997
I know it's supposed to be a secret...

510
00:49:20,998 --> 00:49:23,374
...but I can stay human.

511
00:49:23,375 --> 00:49:25,126
But you know...

512
00:49:25,127 --> 00:49:30,127
I can do it...

513
00:49:35,554 --> 00:49:37,806
Y-Yuki...!

514
00:49:37,807 --> 00:49:40,100
Hana, did you get a dog?

515
00:49:40,101 --> 00:49:43,103
Um, yeah...

516
00:49:43,104 --> 00:49:45,063
Isn't that a wolf?

517
00:49:45,064 --> 00:49:47,941
--What? N-No, that's...
--isn't it, dear?

518
00:49:47,942 --> 00:49:48,983
Don't be stupid!

519
00:49:48,984 --> 00:49:53,279
There are no wolves in Japan anymore. That's
a shepherd mixed with something else.

520
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:56,199
Right, Hana? Am I right? Am I right?

521
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:58,034
Oh? The dog's gone.

522
00:49:58,035 --> 00:50:00,161
Hello, Mrs. Nirasaki!

523
00:50:00,162 --> 00:50:03,039
Oh hello, Yuki. Aren't you friendly today.

524
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:05,917
Oh, you and the dog have matching clothes!

525
00:50:05,918 --> 00:50:08,378
That's cute.

526
00:50:08,379 --> 00:50:13,379
Yu... Yuki...

527
00:50:15,719 --> 00:50:20,719
What's wrong, Hana?

528
00:50:39,118 --> 00:50:42,245
Hello?

529
00:50:42,246 --> 00:50:42,746
Hello!

530
00:50:50,087 --> 00:50:53,256
I wonder where Grandpa Nirasaki is...

531
00:50:53,257 --> 00:50:55,383
Oh, these grew nicely.

532
00:50:55,384 --> 00:50:56,634
It was thanks to everyone's help.

533
00:50:56,635 --> 00:50:59,721
Ours were destroyed, so
this'll really help.

534
00:50:59,722 --> 00:51:01,097
Destroyed? By what?

535
00:51:01,098 --> 00:51:02,307
By a wild boar.

536
00:51:02,308 --> 00:51:03,641
Here, take this.

537
00:51:03,642 --> 00:51:05,185
This much--?

538
00:51:05,186 --> 00:51:06,561
The boar, that bastard...

539
00:51:06,562 --> 00:51:09,105
Oh, thank you for bringing this.

540
00:51:09,106 --> 00:51:12,650
It came and dug everything up
without making a sound.

541
00:51:12,651 --> 00:51:15,862
It came all the way down
to Sakai's fields this year.

542
00:51:15,863 --> 00:51:18,323
Here, take this in return.
Watch out, it's heavy.

543
00:51:18,324 --> 00:51:21,910
The only fields with
no animal damage are yours, Hana.

544
00:51:21,911 --> 00:51:24,204
It's strange, even though
you're so deep in the mountains.

545
00:51:24,205 --> 00:51:25,955
Do you have some kind of trick?

546
00:51:25,956 --> 00:51:27,415
No, I don't...

547
00:51:27,416 --> 00:51:29,417
Everyone wants to know how you did it.

548
00:51:29,418 --> 00:51:30,960
What's a trick?

549
00:51:30,961 --> 00:51:32,337
I need to pee!

550
00:51:32,338 --> 00:51:35,882
Yuki's a lively child, isn't she?

551
00:51:35,883 --> 00:51:37,091
Could it be...?

552
00:51:37,092 --> 00:51:38,426
What is it?

553
00:51:38,427 --> 00:51:41,054
Oh, no, never mind.

554
00:51:41,055 --> 00:51:43,473
Wow, thank you very much.

555
00:51:43,474 --> 00:51:44,182
Don't mention it.

556
00:51:44,183 --> 00:51:45,600
Thanks for the potatoes.

557
00:51:45,601 --> 00:51:47,101
It's been a while since we had eggs.

558
00:51:47,102 --> 00:51:48,561
I'm glad to help.

559
00:51:48,562 --> 00:51:50,605
Let me know when you run out!

560
00:51:50,606 --> 00:51:53,858
Oh my, isn't that cute!

561
00:51:53,859 --> 00:51:55,318
Hmm?

562
00:51:55,319 --> 00:51:56,527
What?

563
00:51:56,528 --> 00:51:57,487
Ready, lift.

564
00:51:57,488 --> 00:51:59,822
Oh, you don't have to give us
something so big...

565
00:51:59,823 --> 00:52:01,699
Don't worry about it.

566
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:03,618
It was just sitting in the storage shed.

567
00:52:03,619 --> 00:52:04,953
But--

568
00:52:04,954 --> 00:52:08,748
Please take it. If we bring it
back, Gramps'll get mad at us.

569
00:52:08,749 --> 00:52:10,166
Grandpa Nirasaki?

570
00:52:10,167 --> 00:52:12,585
He's always talking about you, Hana.

571
00:52:12,586 --> 00:52:13,670
Because he's fallen for her.

572
00:52:13,671 --> 00:52:15,546
Come on, he's already ninety.

573
00:52:15,547 --> 00:52:18,800
But he even told everyone
to help her and everything.

574
00:52:18,801 --> 00:52:22,595
Idiot! He said not to say anything
about that, remember?!

575
00:52:22,596 --> 00:52:27,596
So that's what it was...?

576
00:52:38,821 --> 00:52:43,821
I finally understand
why I needed a bigger field.

577
00:52:48,622 --> 00:52:50,081
I don't like it.

578
00:52:50,082 --> 00:52:51,332
What?

579
00:52:51,333 --> 00:52:56,333
Why are you always smiling and laughing?

580
00:52:58,716 --> 00:53:03,636
Don't laugh.

581
00:53:03,637 --> 00:53:08,637
What's so funny?

582
00:53:15,399 --> 00:53:20,399
We moved here trying
to get away from prying eyes...

583
00:53:20,487 --> 00:53:25,487
When did we end up in the care
of the people from the village?

584
00:53:26,243 --> 00:53:31,243
It was hard at first,
but I think we'll do fine here.

585
00:53:41,050 --> 00:53:46,050
Wow, look at that!

586
00:56:47,027 --> 00:56:48,986
M-Mommy--!

587
00:56:48,987 --> 00:56:50,947
Mommy--! Mom--

588
00:56:50,948 --> 00:56:51,572
Ame!

589
00:56:51,573 --> 00:56:54,575
Mom! Ame's fallen--!

590
00:56:54,576 --> 00:56:58,996
Mommy! Mommy--!

591
00:56:58,997 --> 00:57:01,499
Ame!

592
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:05,711
Ame! Ame!

593
00:57:05,712 --> 00:57:07,797
Ame“!

594
00:57:07,798 --> 00:57:09,799
Mom... my...

595
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:11,801
Ame!

596
00:57:11,802 --> 00:57:16,802
Mom... my...

597
00:57:27,859 --> 00:57:31,112
Ame... Ame!

598
00:57:31,113 --> 00:57:32,989
A-Ame!

599
00:57:32,990 --> 00:57:35,533
Open your eyes! Ame!

600
00:57:35,534 --> 00:57:37,243
Open your eyes!

601
00:57:37,244 --> 00:57:41,747
Ame, Ame, Ame...

602
00:57:41,748 --> 00:57:46,748
Open your eyes...

603
00:57:47,629 --> 00:57:50,256
Mommy... That's... too tight...

604
00:57:50,257 --> 00:57:51,924
Ame!!

605
00:57:51,925 --> 00:57:53,593
You know what?

606
00:57:53,594 --> 00:57:56,512
I found a crested kingfisher.

607
00:57:56,513 --> 00:58:01,513
It was a really nice-looking bird.
I felt like even I could catch it today.

608
00:58:03,478 --> 00:58:07,565
It was completely different
from how it usually feels.

609
00:58:07,566 --> 00:58:12,566
I wasn't scared. Suddenly,
I felt like I could do anything.

610
00:58:12,696 --> 00:58:16,657
So then, I--

611
00:58:16,658 --> 00:58:19,702
Why are you crying?

612
00:58:19,703 --> 00:58:24,703
What are we doing here?

613
00:58:27,628 --> 00:58:32,628
Mother said later that she had
never been more frightened in her life.

614
00:58:33,675 --> 00:58:38,675
After that incident, Ame seemed
like a completely different person.

615
00:58:42,142 --> 00:58:47,142
"Yuki - Age 6" "Ame
- Age 5" "Yuki - Age 5"

616
00:59:00,118 --> 00:59:01,243
However--

617
00:59:01,244 --> 00:59:02,703
No matter what happens--

618
00:59:02,704 --> 00:59:06,123
I won't turn into a wolf. I know already!

619
00:59:06,124 --> 00:59:06,874
Don't forget your promise!

620
00:59:06,875 --> 00:59:08,167
I'll be fine!

621
00:59:08,168 --> 00:59:10,670
Then remember,
"Piggy promise, promise kept."

622
00:59:10,671 --> 00:59:12,254
What's that?

623
00:59:12,255 --> 00:59:14,131
It's a charm to keep you
from becoming a wolf.

624
00:59:14,132 --> 00:59:15,508
A charm?

625
00:59:15,509 --> 00:59:18,719

00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:19,887

636
00:59:59,386 --> 01:00:01,887
It was the first time in my life

637
01:00:01,888 --> 01:00:04,890
that I had ever been surrounded
by so many people.

638
01:00:04,891 --> 01:00:07,017
--Don't push me!
--I had wanted to go so badly...

639
01:00:07,018 --> 01:00:09,645
--Stop pushing me!
--...but when it finally came down to it,

640
01:00:09,646 --> 01:00:14,646
I wasn't sure if I would be okay or not.

641
01:00:14,693 --> 01:00:19,693
But that was just at the beginning.

642
01:00:20,407 --> 01:00:21,991
Daddy, I'm off!

643
01:00:21,992 --> 01:00:23,993
I'm going now!

644
01:00:23,994 --> 01:00:26,162
Okay, be careful.

645
01:00:26,163 --> 01:00:26,663
I will!

646
01:00:32,043 --> 01:00:33,794
'Morning, Shino!

647
01:00:33,795 --> 01:00:34,962
Good morning, Yuki!

648
01:00:34,963 --> 01:00:36,422
I saved you a seat!

649
01:00:36,423 --> 01:00:37,590

01:00:39,426 --> 01:00:41,427
Who knows the answer to this question?

652
01:00:41,428 --> 01:00:46,140
--I do!
--I do! I do! I do! I do! I do!

653
01:00:46,141 --> 01:00:48,559

01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:53,560
--You can do it!
--Go, Yuki!

655
01:00:54,566 --> 01:00:56,567
Wow, Yuki!

656
01:00:56,568 --> 01:01:00,613

"Townspeople Division"

658
01:01:07,746 --> 01:01:10,372
This is...

659
01:01:10,373 --> 01:01:14,376
"Niikawa Nature Sanctuary"
"Nature Conservationist Assistant Wanted"

660
01:01:14,377 --> 01:01:19,377
"Hometown Nature"

661
01:01:22,344 --> 01:01:24,678
Thank you for waiting. Shall we go?

662
01:01:24,679 --> 01:01:27,389
My name is Tendo, and I
am a nature conservationist.

663
01:01:27,390 --> 01:01:30,059
Welcome to Niikawa Nature Sanctuary.

664
01:01:30,060 --> 01:01:32,937
I look forward to working with you.

665
01:01:32,938 --> 01:01:37,608
A nature conservationist's job
is not just to protect nature.

666
01:01:37,609 --> 01:01:41,403
Environmental education, field surveys,
the conservation of plants and animals--

667
01:01:41,404 --> 01:01:45,991
These three pillars of conservancy are made
possible by the support of volunteers.

668
01:01:45,992 --> 01:01:49,578
We do many different types of work,
so while we are specialists,

669
01:01:49,579 --> 01:01:52,623
we also need to be able to do
a little of everything.

670
01:01:52,624 --> 01:01:57,624
So, we are looking for someone who can help
the conservationist with all the work, but...

671
01:01:59,923 --> 01:02:04,923
Honestly speaking, we can't pay very much.
We can pay enough to cover training expenses

672
01:02:06,054 --> 01:02:08,180
for someone studying
to become a conservationist,

673
01:02:08,181 --> 01:02:10,599
but we can't afford much more than that.

674
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:14,186
A high schooler's part-time job
pays a lot more per hour.

675
01:02:14,187 --> 01:02:16,188
Even knowing all that...

676
01:02:16,189 --> 01:02:19,441
...do you still want to do it?

677
01:02:19,442 --> 01:02:24,442
Um... I heard that you have a wolf here...

678
01:02:27,242 --> 01:02:29,326
This is our timber wolf.

679
01:02:29,327 --> 01:02:30,953
He's very quiet.

680
01:02:30,954 --> 01:02:33,497
He's not that young anymore.

681
01:02:33,498 --> 01:02:35,583
Excuse me, Director--?

682
01:02:35,584 --> 01:02:40,584
Excuse me for a moment.

683
01:02:45,176 --> 01:02:49,054
Nice to meet you. I came
because I have something to ask you.

684
01:02:49,055 --> 01:02:51,056
He's a wolf's child.

685
01:02:51,057 --> 01:02:53,142
His father, the wolf, died.

686
01:02:53,143 --> 01:02:57,229
I'm his mother,
but I don't know how to raise a wolf.

687
01:02:57,230 --> 01:03:02,230
How did you learn the ways of the wolf?

688
01:03:03,403 --> 01:03:08,403
Will you tell us how
you were raised in the forest?

689
01:03:20,086 --> 01:03:23,380
Sorry about that.

690
01:03:23,381 --> 01:03:27,217
A wealthy person got
special permission to keep him as a pet,

691
01:03:27,218 --> 01:03:30,638
but when the owner died there was no one
to take him, so he came to live with us.

692
01:03:30,639 --> 01:03:33,933
Apparently, he was born in the Moscow Zoo.

693
01:03:33,934 --> 01:03:35,935
So he isn't from the wild?

694
01:03:35,936 --> 01:03:38,979
I think it's rare to see
wild wolves in zoos.

695
01:03:38,980 --> 01:03:42,608
If they're bred, the babies
are sent out to be fostered.

696
01:03:42,609 --> 01:03:47,488
There are also wild birds and raccoon dogs
who are brought here when they get hurt.

697
01:03:47,489 --> 01:03:52,489
After we treat them--

698
01:03:52,661 --> 01:03:54,995
I'm going to start coming here from now on.

699
01:03:54,996 --> 01:03:59,124
Ame, you'll be okay coming with me, right?

700
01:03:59,125 --> 01:04:02,169
I'll learn about
the mountains and nature as I work,

701
01:04:02,170 --> 01:04:06,215
and teach you the things I learn.

702
01:04:06,216 --> 01:04:08,384
It was my first time seeing a real one.

703
01:04:08,385 --> 01:04:09,885
A wolf?

704
01:04:09,886 --> 01:04:11,887
Was Daddy like that, too?

705
01:04:11,888 --> 01:04:13,889
No, not at all.

706
01:04:13,890 --> 01:04:14,932
I'm glad.

707
01:04:14,933 --> 01:04:16,558
Why?

708
01:04:16,559 --> 01:04:21,559
Because he seemed kind of sad, somehow.

709
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:27,440
I wanted to meet Daddy.

710
01:04:27,696 --> 01:04:31,991
Mommy wants to see him again, too.

711
01:04:31,992 --> 01:04:36,992
As Mother settled into her new job,
I was undergoing a huge shock.

712
01:04:37,539 --> 01:04:39,081
Bunko, yours is so nice!

713
01:04:39,082 --> 01:04:40,708
Keno, yours is pretty, too!

714
01:04:40,709 --> 01:04:42,710
I found a four-leaf clover!

715
01:04:42,711 --> 01:04:43,836
Me, too!

716
01:04:43,837 --> 01:04:46,672
Yuki, did you find anything?

717
01:04:46,673 --> 01:04:50,342
Yeah, look!

718
01:04:50,343 --> 01:04:55,343
I found out that no other girls
played with rat snakes for fun.

719
01:04:56,349 --> 01:04:58,767
Look, these used to be my mom's.

720
01:04:58,768 --> 01:05:00,269
They're so pretty.

721
01:05:00,270 --> 01:05:02,980
My parents bought this for me
for my last birthday.

722
01:05:02,981 --> 01:05:04,648
Lucky!

723
01:05:04,649 --> 01:05:06,650
Yuki, show us your treasure box, too!

724
01:05:06,651 --> 01:05:07,526
Okay!

725
01:05:07,527 --> 01:05:08,986
Ooh, what's inside?

726
01:05:08,987 --> 01:05:12,114
Look!

727
01:05:12,115 --> 01:05:17,115
I was also the only girl who collected
small animal bones and dried reptiles.

728
01:05:20,248 --> 01:05:24,126
The moment I realized
that other girls didn't do those things,

729
01:05:24,127 --> 01:05:26,462
I was so embarrassed.

730
01:05:26,463 --> 01:05:28,172
Hurry UP!

731
01:05:28,173 --> 01:05:30,507
That was when I decided.

732
01:05:30,508 --> 01:05:35,508
From then on, I was going to act
more graceful and ladylike.

733
01:05:38,933 --> 01:05:41,810
Don't laugh! I'm seriously
worrying about this!

734
01:05:41,811 --> 01:05:44,938
Why don't you just do what you want, Yuki?

735
01:05:44,939 --> 01:05:47,524
I don't want people looking at me funny!

736
01:05:47,525 --> 01:05:49,359
I guess it can't be helped.

737
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:49,860
Huh?

738
01:05:56,159 --> 01:06:01,159
When Mother made a new dress for me,
I remember being really happy.

739
01:06:02,665 --> 01:06:03,499
Good morning.

740
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:06,251
Thanks to the dress,
I was able to fit in with my class

741
01:06:06,252 --> 01:06:09,129
--and get along with my friends.
--Good morning!

742
01:06:09,130 --> 01:06:10,297
Good morning!

743
01:06:10,298 --> 01:06:12,424
Oh, Yuki, your dress is so cute!

744
01:06:12,425 --> 01:06:13,717
It's wonderful!

745
01:06:13,718 --> 01:06:16,053
--Lucky! --Heaven only knows
how much that dress helped me.

746
01:06:16,054 --> 01:06:18,055
--Okay! --Heaven only knows how
much that dress helped me.

747
01:06:18,056 --> 01:06:19,223
The next year,

748
01:06:19,224 --> 01:06:21,975
it was hard to get Ame to school.

749
01:06:21,976 --> 01:06:26,976
Get it? It's "Piggy promise, promise kept."

750
01:06:27,899 --> 01:06:32,899
School's this way!

751
01:06:38,159 --> 01:06:43,159
"Happy first day of school!"
"1st Grade"

752
01:06:43,623 --> 01:06:48,623
"Let's get along!"
"2nd Grade"

753
01:06:50,046 --> 01:06:55,046
"Full of energy!"
"1st Grade"

754
01:06:58,638 --> 01:07:03,638
"Let's be friends!"
"2nd Grade"

755
01:07:17,991 --> 01:07:22,991
"Please and Thank You"
"3rd Grade"

756
01:07:23,746 --> 01:07:28,746
"Let's fly together!"
"4th Grade"

757
01:07:30,003 --> 01:07:35,003
"Let's figure it out!"
"3rd Grade"

758
01:07:44,809 --> 01:07:46,059
Good morning.

759
01:07:46,060 --> 01:07:48,604
Oh, Ame, is it a school holiday?

760
01:07:48,605 --> 01:07:49,229
No.

761
01:07:49,230 --> 01:07:50,189
So you're skipping?

762
01:07:50,190 --> 01:07:52,733
Yeah.

763
01:07:52,734 --> 01:07:54,860
You can come here anytime.

764
01:07:54,861 --> 01:07:57,738
Sorry for always bringing him here.

765
01:07:57,739 --> 01:07:59,364
--Yes, this is the observation pond.
--Ah, you're going bird-watching.

766
01:07:59,365 --> 01:08:03,410
--You can see frogs that still have their tails.
--One moment, please. You'll find it...

767
01:08:03,411 --> 01:08:05,495
--Hana, can you help me for a sec?
--...over there on your right.

768
01:08:05,496 --> 01:08:05,996
Coming!

769
01:08:20,303 --> 01:08:22,054
Attention, everyone!

770
01:08:22,055 --> 01:08:25,766
Let me introduce a transfer student.
This is Sohei Fujii.

771
01:08:25,767 --> 01:08:27,517
Why don't you greet everyone?

772
01:08:27,518 --> 01:08:29,728
I'm Sohei. Nice to meet you.

773
01:08:29,729 --> 01:08:34,316
Nice to meet you!

774
01:08:34,317 --> 01:08:36,944
Hey, do you have dogs at your house?

775
01:08:36,945 --> 01:08:38,737
Huh? Why?

776
01:08:38,738 --> 01:08:43,408
You smell kind of like animals.

777
01:08:43,409 --> 01:08:44,451
We don't have any dogs.

778
01:08:44,452 --> 01:08:49,206
Really? That's weird.
I totally thought you had dogs.

779
01:08:49,207 --> 01:08:50,499
What is it?

780
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:52,626
Huh? Oh, the smell--

781
01:08:52,627 --> 01:08:54,378
Smell? What smell?

782
01:08:54,379 --> 01:08:59,379
Maybe it's just my imagination...

783
01:09:08,559 --> 01:09:10,435
Which one should I pick...?

784
01:09:10,436 --> 01:09:11,812
I'll go with this one!

785
01:09:11,813 --> 01:09:15,816
Aw man, seriously?

786
01:09:15,817 --> 01:09:17,150
Oh, Yuki!

787
01:09:17,151 --> 01:09:20,779
Yuki, you should come join us.
Sohei's funny.

788
01:09:20,780 --> 01:09:24,658
Oh, I have to return this book.

789
01:09:24,659 --> 01:09:26,660
What's up with her?

790
01:09:26,661 --> 01:09:29,788
She's not usually like that...

791
01:09:29,789 --> 01:09:31,707
Hey, Yuki, you know--

792
01:09:31,708 --> 01:09:33,583
Oh, Yuki--

793
01:09:33,584 --> 01:09:35,752
You know what?

794
01:09:35,753 --> 01:09:37,170
Hey. Yuki!

795
01:09:37,171 --> 01:09:38,380
Yuki--

796
01:09:38,381 --> 01:09:41,967
C'mon, Yuki--

797
01:09:41,968 --> 01:09:46,138
Tell me the truth!

798
01:09:46,139 --> 01:09:47,097
About what?

799
01:09:47,098 --> 01:09:49,599
Did I do something to you?

800
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:51,101
You didn't do anything.

801
01:09:51,102 --> 01:09:53,353
Do you dislike me
because I'm a transfer student?

802
01:09:53,354 --> 01:09:54,354
That's it, isn't it?

803
01:09:54,355 --> 01:09:55,605
I said, it's nothing.

804
01:09:55,606 --> 01:09:57,065
Then why are you avoiding me?

805
01:09:57,066 --> 01:09:58,734
I'm not avoiding you!

806
01:09:58,735 --> 01:10:00,736
Piggy promise, promise kept.

807
01:10:00,737 --> 01:10:02,738
Piggy promise, promise kept.

808
01:10:02,739 --> 01:10:05,324
--Piggy--
--Hey!

809
01:10:05,325 --> 01:10:06,450
Wait!

810
01:10:06,451 --> 01:10:08,076
Piggy promise, promise kept.

811
01:10:08,077 --> 01:10:09,828
Piggy promise, promise kept.

812
01:10:09,829 --> 01:10:11,371
Piggy promise, promise kept.

813
01:10:11,372 --> 01:10:16,372
Piggy promise, promise kept.

814
01:10:24,594 --> 01:10:27,179
Stop following me!

815
01:10:27,180 --> 01:10:29,264
Don't come any closer!

816
01:10:29,265 --> 01:10:30,682
What are you doing?

817
01:10:30,683 --> 01:10:32,476
Don't touch me!

818
01:10:32,477 --> 01:10:37,477
Yuki! Yuki!

819
01:10:47,742 --> 01:10:52,742
"Tsururindo"

820
01:11:08,012 --> 01:11:12,682
Sorry to bother you during work.

821
01:11:12,683 --> 01:11:15,227
Do you know how much
his head was bleeding?

822
01:11:15,228 --> 01:11:16,812
It was my ear.

823
01:11:16,813 --> 01:11:18,313
Yuki.

824
01:11:18,314 --> 01:11:23,314
She wouldn't talk no matter
what we asked her...

825
01:11:24,612 --> 01:11:29,574
Were you really the one who hurt him?

826
01:11:29,575 --> 01:11:34,575
Did you apologize?

827
01:11:35,081 --> 01:11:37,457
Apologize.

828
01:11:37,458 --> 01:11:42,458
I said, apologize.

829
01:11:51,347 --> 01:11:54,599
I'm sorry.

830
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:57,060
I'm very sorry for what my child has done.

831
01:11:57,061 --> 01:11:59,729
That's how it is, Mrs. Fujii.

832
01:11:59,730 --> 01:12:02,399
There is the school's insurance
for the medical bills, so--

833
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:07,400
Do you really think this can be
taken care of with just an apology?!

834
01:12:07,405 --> 01:12:11,032
What were you planning to do
if he lost his hearing?

835
01:12:11,033 --> 01:12:13,618
Parents are responsible
for their children's actions, aren't they?

836
01:12:13,619 --> 01:12:16,705
Would you go into debt
or sell your house to compensate us?

837
01:12:16,706 --> 01:12:18,915
Now, now, this isn't the place to--

838
01:12:18,916 --> 01:12:22,294
If you don't let me
hear what she's thinking, I'll--

839
01:12:22,295 --> 01:12:23,628
A wolf.

840
01:12:23,629 --> 01:12:25,422
What?

841
01:12:25,423 --> 01:12:29,551
It was a wolf that did it.

842
01:12:29,552 --> 01:12:31,178
A wolf did it.

843
01:12:31,179 --> 01:12:32,471
Sohei?

844
01:12:32,472 --> 01:12:34,473
What are you saying?

845
01:12:34,474 --> 01:12:36,183
Sohei!

846
01:12:36,184 --> 01:12:38,018
Sohei?

847
01:12:38,019 --> 01:12:39,728
Don't decide whose fault it is already!

848
01:12:39,729 --> 01:12:40,729
I know!

849
01:12:40,730 --> 01:12:42,272
She's been different lately--

850
01:12:42,273 --> 01:12:42,773
Sum it!

851
01:12:48,529 --> 01:12:53,529
That's what I thought.

852
01:12:58,539 --> 01:13:00,540
What happened to Sohei?

853
01:13:00,541 --> 01:13:01,917
He left early.

854
01:13:01,918 --> 01:13:03,210
Why?

855
01:13:03,211 --> 01:13:04,461
Because he got hurt.

856
01:13:04,462 --> 01:13:06,338
How did he get hurt?

857
01:13:06,339 --> 01:13:07,339
That's--

858
01:13:07,340 --> 01:13:09,382
Who hurt him?

859
01:13:09,383 --> 01:13:11,426
Um...

860
01:13:11,427 --> 01:13:11,885
Yuki!

861
01:13:11,886 --> 01:13:13,011
--Yuki!
--I thought it was her.

862
01:13:13,012 --> 01:13:14,679
--Thought so.
--What's wrong?

863
01:13:14,680 --> 01:13:16,014
I'm like a detective--

864
01:13:16,015 --> 01:13:21,015
Quiet! Everyone, quiet down!

865
01:13:22,355 --> 01:13:25,357
It didn't work.

866
01:13:25,358 --> 01:13:30,358
No matter how many times I tried the charm.

867
01:13:30,780 --> 01:13:35,534
Will I be chased out of school?

868
01:13:35,535 --> 01:13:40,535
Will we have to leave our house?

869
01:13:41,541 --> 01:13:45,335
I'm sorry...

870
01:13:45,336 --> 01:13:50,336
I'm sorry!

871
01:13:51,467 --> 01:13:55,262
Mom, I'm sorry!

872
01:13:55,263 --> 01:14:00,263
All better, all better.

873
01:14:15,157 --> 01:14:20,157
"School Bus"

874
01:14:39,432 --> 01:14:39,932
Sohei?

875
01:14:49,525 --> 01:14:54,525
Homework. From Sohei.

876
01:15:11,005 --> 01:15:16,005
From Sohei.

877
01:15:20,765 --> 01:15:24,309
Ow...

878
01:15:24,310 --> 01:15:27,312
Sohei!

879
01:15:27,313 --> 01:15:31,358
She went to play at Shino's house today.

880
01:15:31,359 --> 01:15:33,735
I see...

881
01:15:33,736 --> 01:15:38,736
Oh, wait a minute.

882
01:15:46,040 --> 01:15:48,416
You came a long way, didn't you?

883
01:15:48,417 --> 01:15:52,295
Thank you for coming by every day.

884
01:15:52,296 --> 01:15:57,296
I don't want Yuki to stop coming to school.

885
01:15:57,426 --> 01:16:02,426
You know, that day,
you said that a wolf did it, right?

886
01:16:02,473 --> 01:16:04,683
What did you mean by that?

887
01:16:04,684 --> 01:16:08,311
That was... I mean...

888
01:16:08,312 --> 01:16:13,312
You might not believe me, but that
day, I saw a wolf for a split second,

889
01:16:13,818 --> 01:16:18,818
and when I came to, I was bleeding.
So the wolf was the one who did it.

890
01:16:19,490 --> 01:16:22,117
I mean, it wasn't Yuki's fault.

891
01:16:22,118 --> 01:16:26,371
I know other kids
are saying stupid things, but...

892
01:16:26,372 --> 01:16:29,124
I see.

893
01:16:29,125 --> 01:16:32,210
Can I ask you one more thing?

894
01:16:32,211 --> 01:16:37,211
Do you hate wolves?

895
01:16:37,758 --> 01:16:40,969
Not really.

896
01:16:40,970 --> 01:16:45,970
Me neither.

897
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:06,202
Hey, you wanna see this?

898
01:17:06,203 --> 01:17:06,703
What?

899
01:17:12,209 --> 01:17:15,086
It's cool, isn't it? Wanna touch it?

900
01:17:15,087 --> 01:17:15,587
Here.

901
01:17:21,802 --> 01:17:23,219
Does it hurt?

902
01:17:23,220 --> 01:17:28,220
It itches.

903
01:17:28,768 --> 01:17:29,380
Let's go!

904
01:17:34,106 --> 01:17:36,024
I'm going now.

905
01:17:36,025 --> 01:17:37,650
Where are you going?

906
01:17:37,651 --> 01:17:38,818
I'm going to Sensei's place.

907
01:17:38,819 --> 01:17:40,195
Who's Sensei?

908
01:17:40,196 --> 01:17:42,989
Sensei... is Sensei.

909
01:17:42,990 --> 01:17:45,575
I see. Will you be okay by yourself?

910
01:17:45,576 --> 01:17:46,868
Yeah.

911
01:17:46,869 --> 01:17:47,911
Be careful.

912
01:17:47,912 --> 01:17:48,995
Okay.

913
01:17:48,996 --> 01:17:50,538
Don't stay out too late.

914
01:17:50,539 --> 01:17:51,039
Okay.

915
01:17:55,753 --> 01:17:56,961
Where's Yuki?

916
01:17:56,962 --> 01:17:58,671
She went back to school today.

917
01:17:58,672 --> 01:18:00,173
Oh, that's good.

918
01:18:00,174 --> 01:18:01,591
What about Ame?

919
01:18:01,592 --> 01:18:03,676
He comes and goes, I guess.

920
01:18:03,677 --> 01:18:05,678
That's fine.

921
01:18:05,679 --> 01:18:06,763
There's something to be said

922
01:18:06,764 --> 01:18:09,974
for a guy who stops
going to school in elementary school.

923
01:18:09,975 --> 01:18:11,976
Edison and I were both like that.

924
01:18:11,977 --> 01:18:14,145
There you go, saying such
irresponsible things again!

925
01:18:14,146 --> 01:18:16,397
Speaking of which,
does anyone live on the mountain?

926
01:18:16,398 --> 01:18:17,023
On the mountain?

927
01:18:17,024 --> 01:18:19,526
Ame said he was going to Sensei's place...

928
01:18:19,527 --> 01:18:21,861
I was sure he was talking
about Grandpa Nirasaki, but...

929
01:18:21,862 --> 01:18:23,863
I don't know about that...

930
01:18:23,864 --> 01:18:28,159
No one would go into the mountains
during the busy farming season.

931
01:18:28,160 --> 01:18:31,037
Sensei knows everything.

932
01:18:31,038 --> 01:18:33,039
He knows everything about the mountain.

933
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:36,417
I didn't think you'd make friends
with someone older than you.

934
01:18:36,418 --> 01:18:40,547
Bring him over to our house sometime.
I want to thank him, and--

935
01:18:40,548 --> 01:18:42,549
Sensei doesn't meet with humans.

936
01:18:42,550 --> 01:18:47,303
He doesn't come down to the village
like the wild boars and bears.

937
01:18:47,304 --> 01:18:52,304
But it's probably okay if it's you, Mom.

938
01:19:06,532 --> 01:19:11,532
Sensei is the master
of the entire mountain in these parts.

939
01:19:12,371 --> 01:19:17,371
Thank you for always taking care of Ame.

940
01:21:48,402 --> 01:21:53,402
"Hometown Nature"

941
01:21:59,079 --> 01:22:04,079
"Hometown Nature"

942
01:22:05,335 --> 01:22:07,503
You can take a bath now.

943
01:22:07,504 --> 01:22:09,922
Yuki, you should have
Sensei teach you, too.

944
01:22:09,923 --> 01:22:12,633
Your hunting will get a lot better.

945
01:22:12,634 --> 01:22:15,344
There's a trick to running
through the forest at full speed.

946
01:22:15,345 --> 01:22:18,389
And to reading the terrain, too.

947
01:22:18,390 --> 01:22:20,099
You'll learn a lot.

948
01:22:20,100 --> 01:22:22,351
How to find water and how
to read the weather,

949
01:22:22,352 --> 01:22:25,646
and marking your territory
and getting along with others--

950
01:22:25,647 --> 01:22:27,065
There's no way I'm going.

951
01:22:27,066 --> 01:22:27,857
Why not?

952
01:22:27,858 --> 01:22:30,318
What about you?
Why won't you come to school?

953
01:22:30,319 --> 01:22:32,528
Because the mountain's interesting.

954
01:22:32,529 --> 01:22:34,238
Because there's a lot I don't know.

955
01:22:34,239 --> 01:22:35,615
I don't need to know.

956
01:22:35,616 --> 01:22:36,407
Why not?

957
01:22:36,408 --> 01:22:40,161
Just come to school already.

958
01:22:40,162 --> 01:22:40,912
I don't want to.

959
01:22:40,913 --> 01:22:41,662
Why not?

960
01:22:41,663 --> 01:22:42,622
Because I'm a wolf.

961
01:22:42,623 --> 01:22:43,623
You're a human.

962
01:22:43,624 --> 01:22:48,624
I'm a wolf.

963
01:22:49,338 --> 01:22:51,923
I've already decided not to become a wolf.

964
01:22:51,924 --> 01:22:53,758
Why not?

965
01:22:53,759 --> 01:22:54,759
Hey, Why not?

966
01:22:54,760 --> 01:22:57,804
Because I'm human! Do you hear me?!
Because I'm human!

967
01:22:57,805 --> 01:22:59,055
But Why?

968
01:22:59,056 --> 01:23:00,807
Stop asking so many questions!

969
01:23:00,808 --> 01:23:03,351
You're a wolf, aren't you?
Why don't you act like one?

970
01:23:03,352 --> 01:23:05,686
Shut up! You don't know anything!

971
01:23:05,687 --> 01:23:07,188
About what?

972
01:23:07,189 --> 01:23:09,565
If you don't come to school tomorrow,
I'll never forgive you!

973
01:23:09,566 --> 01:23:10,441
I'm not going!

974
01:23:10,442 --> 01:23:11,692
I'll never forgive you!

975
01:23:11,693 --> 01:23:16,693
I'm not going!

976
01:23:19,326 --> 01:23:21,953
Wanna fight?

977
01:23:21,954 --> 01:23:25,748
What is it? What's that sound?

978
01:23:25,749 --> 01:23:30,749
Yuki! Ame!

979
01:23:33,632 --> 01:23:38,632
Stop it, both of you!

980
01:23:50,691 --> 01:23:55,691
Stop it, Yuki! Ame!

981
01:24:11,420 --> 01:24:12,378
Yuki...

982
01:24:12,379 --> 01:24:12,879
Ame...?

983
01:24:21,680 --> 01:24:22,180
Ame...

984
01:24:50,667 --> 01:24:55,667
Yuki and Ame are both
starting to walk their own paths.

985
01:24:56,381 --> 01:25:01,381
Even though that's what I wanted...
Why am I so uneasy?

986
01:25:04,681 --> 01:25:09,681
Why is that?

987
01:25:15,901 --> 01:25:20,901
My last summer in elementary school, there
were a number of record-breaking storms.

988
01:25:21,782 --> 01:25:26,410
Ame started to go
into the mountains all the time.

989
01:25:26,411 --> 01:25:31,411
He seemed to be very worried
about the effects of the heavy rains

990
01:25:31,792 --> 01:25:36,792
on Sensei and the plants
and animals of the mountains.

991
01:26:01,071 --> 01:26:04,448
Ame!

992
01:26:04,449 --> 01:26:07,034
Where have you been all this time?

993
01:26:07,035 --> 01:26:10,162
You're cold. Hang on,
I'll get the bath ready.

994
01:26:10,163 --> 01:26:13,958
Sensei... hurt his leg, and he can't move.

995
01:26:13,959 --> 01:26:18,959
He'll probably die soon.

996
01:26:19,756 --> 01:26:24,756
Someone has to take over all the things
he has been doing on the mountain.

997
01:26:28,098 --> 01:26:30,141
Ame.

998
01:26:30,142 --> 01:26:32,852
You can't go into the mountains anymore.
Do you understand?

999
01:26:32,853 --> 01:26:35,563
You're only ten years old.
You're still a child!

1000
01:26:35,564 --> 01:26:40,564
Even if a ten-year-old wolf is an adult,
you're still--

1001
01:26:51,872 --> 01:26:53,831
Please.

1002
01:26:53,832 --> 01:26:56,751
Please don't go into the mountains anymore.

1003
01:26:56,752 --> 01:27:01,752
Please... For me.

1004
01:27:03,425 --> 01:27:07,345
C'mon! Over here!

1005
01:27:07,346 --> 01:27:12,346
Shoot it! Pass it!

1006
01:27:13,977 --> 01:27:18,522
--By the way, did you know?
--Know what?

1007
01:27:18,523 --> 01:27:19,398
And?

1008
01:27:19,399 --> 01:27:21,150
They said Sohei's mom...

1009
01:27:21,151 --> 01:27:22,401
...is getting married!

1010
01:27:22,402 --> 01:27:24,195
--What?
--No way!

1011
01:27:24,196 --> 01:27:25,321
Why?

1012
01:27:25,322 --> 01:27:26,530
Probably because she's beautiful.

1013
01:27:26,531 --> 01:27:28,949
Then Sohei will have a new dad?

1014
01:27:28,950 --> 01:27:29,867
That's good.

1015
01:27:29,868 --> 01:27:33,371
But Sohei doesn't know about this yet.

1016
01:27:33,372 --> 01:27:34,538
What?

1017
01:27:34,539 --> 01:27:36,957
“No Way!
--Really?

1018
01:27:36,958 --> 01:27:41,003
You can't tell anyone about this!

1019
01:27:41,004 --> 01:27:44,715
All right! Yes!

1020
01:27:44,716 --> 01:27:49,716
How many points do we have now?

1021
01:28:39,271 --> 01:28:40,521
Good morning.

1022
01:28:40,522 --> 01:28:42,773
Today, it will be sunny during the day,

1023
01:28:42,774 --> 01:28:46,318
but heavy rain will start
in the evening and continue overnight.

1024
01:28:46,319 --> 01:28:48,988
--It's so humid! --Please use caution
if you go out during this time.

1025
01:28:48,989 --> 01:28:51,490
First, the meteorological report.

1026
01:28:51,491 --> 01:28:52,116
Yuki--

1027
01:28:52,117 --> 01:28:55,786
--Hm? --Today will start mostly sunny with high
atmospheric pressure within the prefecture,

1028
01:28:55,787 --> 01:28:59,039
--Stay with Mom. --but the weather
front will extend to the Sea of Japan,

1029
01:28:59,040 --> 01:29:02,710
--You'll miss the bus-- --causing stormy
weather from the evening into the night.

1030
01:29:02,711 --> 01:29:05,880
--You stay at home with her.
--And now for the regional forecast.

1031
01:29:05,881 --> 01:29:09,341
--Take care! --In the northwest region,
it will be sunny followed by rain,

1032
01:29:09,342 --> 01:29:12,636
with lightning in some parts.

1033
01:29:12,637 --> 01:29:16,056
The southwest region
will be sunny followed by rain.

1034
01:29:16,057 --> 01:29:19,435
--Ame? --The northeast region will
be sunny with scattered showers.

1035
01:29:19,436 --> 01:29:23,898
--Ame! --The southeast region will
be sunny with scattered showers.

1036
01:29:23,899 --> 01:29:28,899
--Don't forget your umbrellas
when you go out today.

1037
01:29:30,864 --> 01:29:35,576
So the problem is asking, how far
can the swallow fly in three hours?

1038
01:29:35,577 --> 01:29:39,246
First of all, do you know
what seventy km/h means?

1039
01:29:39,247 --> 01:29:41,040
If you take seventy km,

1040
01:29:41,041 --> 01:29:44,043
km/h means the number
of kilometers traveled per hour.

1041
01:29:44,044 --> 01:29:48,756
So in one hour,
the swallow can fly seventy kilometers.

1042
01:29:48,757 --> 01:29:51,383
The weather front along
the Sea of Japan is moving south,

1043
01:29:51,384 --> 01:29:54,887
and atmospheric conditions
have become extremely unstable.

1044
01:29:54,888 --> 01:29:56,013
Because of this,

1045
01:29:56,014 --> 01:30:00,559
there will be lightning and sudden gusts
accompanying the heavy rains.

1046
01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:04,438
Predicted rainfall is,
depending on the location,

1047
01:30:04,439 --> 01:30:08,025
over seventy mm per hour in the flat areas,
and near the mountains,

1048
01:30:08,026 --> 01:30:10,486
over one hundred mm per hour.

1049
01:30:10,487 --> 01:30:15,157
The weather station has issued
a heavy rain flood warning.

1050
01:30:15,158 --> 01:30:20,079
Use extreme caution due to possible landslides,
rises in river level, submersion of buildings,

1051
01:30:20,080 --> 01:30:23,666
as well as other damage.

1052
01:30:23,667 --> 01:30:27,336
And now, for today's
eleven o'clock weather alerts.

1053
01:30:27,337 --> 01:30:32,337
In the northwest region,
heavy rain, lightning, and flood warnings.

1054
01:30:46,481 --> 01:30:50,317
Have a seat, everyone. Sit down!

1055
01:30:50,318 --> 01:30:53,153
It looks like there will be
severe rainstorms soon,

1056
01:30:53,154 --> 01:30:55,406
so afternoon classes have been canceled.

1057
01:30:55,407 --> 01:30:55,907
Yay!

1058
01:31:03,164 --> 01:31:08,164
Until they come, gather in the gym
according to where you live.

1059
01:31:27,522 --> 01:31:32,522
A blackout?

1060
01:31:54,257 --> 01:31:59,257
I have to go.

1061
01:32:04,059 --> 01:32:07,978
I understand. I'll head over now.

1062
01:32:07,979 --> 01:32:11,982
Ame, let's go pick up Yuki together.

1063
01:32:11,983 --> 01:32:12,483
Ame?

1064
01:32:17,614 --> 01:32:18,822
Ame?

1065
01:32:18,823 --> 01:32:23,619
Where are you?

1066
01:32:23,620 --> 01:32:24,120
Ame!

1067
01:32:28,333 --> 01:32:28,833
Ame!

1068
01:32:33,296 --> 01:32:35,964
Ame!

1069
01:32:35,965 --> 01:32:36,465
Ame!

1070
01:32:42,305 --> 01:32:44,765
Where are you, Ame?!

1071
01:32:44,766 --> 01:32:45,266
Ame!

1072
01:33:10,417 --> 01:33:12,751
Takahiro?

1073
01:33:12,752 --> 01:33:13,252
Mommy!

1074
01:33:17,215 --> 01:33:19,216
Keiko!

1075
01:33:19,217 --> 01:33:21,009
Daddy!

1076
01:33:21,010 --> 01:33:26,010
♪ Yankee Doodle came to town-- ♪

1077
01:33:30,228 --> 01:33:33,021
My parents sure are late.

1078
01:33:33,022 --> 01:33:34,440
Don't worry.

1079
01:33:34,441 --> 01:33:36,024
But--

1080
01:33:36,025 --> 01:33:38,402
If we have to stay at the school overnight,

1081
01:33:38,403 --> 01:33:40,028
we can play cards all night.

1082
01:33:40,029 --> 01:33:41,113
Cards?

1083
01:33:41,114 --> 01:33:42,448
I wanna play.

1084
01:33:42,449 --> 01:33:44,032
Oh, that sounds like fun!

1085
01:33:44,033 --> 01:33:45,534
It'll be like camp!

1086
01:33:45,535 --> 01:33:46,952
I'll go get the cards from the classroom.

1087
01:33:46,953 --> 01:33:48,287
Okay.

1088
01:33:48,288 --> 01:33:50,289
Do you even know how to play cards?

1089
01:33:50,290 --> 01:33:52,082
I only know how to play Old Maid.

1090
01:33:52,083 --> 01:33:53,167
Stupid!

1091
01:33:53,168 --> 01:33:56,628
Don't fight, you two.

1092
01:33:56,629 --> 01:33:58,380
Shino!

1093
01:33:58,381 --> 01:33:59,882
Oh, Dad!

1094
01:33:59,883 --> 01:34:01,508
You're so late.

1095
01:34:01,509 --> 01:34:06,509
Sorry, sorry. It's a raging storm out there.
Yuki, we can take you home, too.

1096
01:34:07,098 --> 01:34:09,558
Oh yeah, let's go, Yuki.

1097
01:34:09,559 --> 01:34:11,268
But--

1098
01:34:11,269 --> 01:34:13,187
C'mon, hurry up.

1099
01:34:13,188 --> 01:34:17,274
Thank you for offering,
but I think my mom will be here soon.

1100
01:34:17,275 --> 01:34:18,901
You don't have to hold back.

1101
01:34:18,902 --> 01:34:20,360
Yeah.

1102
01:34:20,361 --> 01:34:23,071
I don't want to miss my mom when she comes.

1103
01:34:23,072 --> 01:34:26,158
That's true. We'll leave first, then.

1104
01:34:26,159 --> 01:34:27,284
Bye!

1105
01:34:27,285 --> 01:34:27,785
Bye.

1106
01:34:42,592 --> 01:34:45,052
Ame!

1107
01:34:45,053 --> 01:34:48,430
Where are you? Ame!

1108
01:34:48,431 --> 01:34:48,931
Ame!

1109
01:34:59,275 --> 01:35:01,735
Ame...

1110
01:35:01,736 --> 01:35:02,348
Where...?

1111
01:35:17,961 --> 01:35:22,961
Sou's taking a long time.

1112
01:35:22,966 --> 01:35:23,466
Yuki--

1113
01:35:32,517 --> 01:35:35,686
What, did Yuki go home already?

1114
01:35:35,687 --> 01:35:38,105
Attention everyone!

1115
01:35:38,106 --> 01:35:43,106
We'll take everyone that's left
home in the school's car.

1116
01:36:18,271 --> 01:36:20,480
Ame!

1117
01:36:20,481 --> 01:36:23,191
Ame!

1118
01:36:23,192 --> 01:36:23,692
Ame!

1119
01:36:29,032 --> 01:36:30,574
Wait!

1120
01:36:30,575 --> 01:36:35,575
Wait, Ame!

1121
01:37:35,556 --> 01:37:36,056
Ame...

1122
01:37:40,937 --> 01:37:45,937
Where are you...?

1123
01:37:58,204 --> 01:37:59,705
Why are you here?

1124
01:37:59,706 --> 01:38:02,165
Because...

1125
01:38:02,166 --> 01:38:04,001
...you were being slow.

1126
01:38:04,002 --> 01:38:07,713
Oh, no one's here.
Did everyone go home already?

1127
01:38:07,714 --> 01:38:11,466
I guess we're the only ones
not getting picked up.

1128
01:38:11,467 --> 01:38:16,263
I wonder if something happened to my mom.

1129
01:38:16,264 --> 01:38:17,180
It's cold.

1130
01:38:17,181 --> 01:38:21,518
Let's walk around.

1131
01:38:21,519 --> 01:38:22,477
Yuki.

1132
01:38:22,478 --> 01:38:26,815
Oh, wait for me!

1133
01:38:26,816 --> 01:38:29,484
What'll we do if no one
comes to pick us up?

1134
01:38:29,485 --> 01:38:31,153
We can just live at school.

1135
01:38:31,154 --> 01:38:32,654
We can't do that.

1136
01:38:32,655 --> 01:38:34,865
We can sleep in the
nurse's office at night.

1137
01:38:34,866 --> 01:38:36,033
What about food?

1138
01:38:36,034 --> 01:38:38,035
We can eat leftover cafeteria food.

1139
01:38:38,036 --> 01:38:41,371
What if no one ever comes to pick us up?
Will you live at school forever?

1140
01:38:41,372 --> 01:38:44,458
I just have to get a job.
Delivering newspapers or something.

1141
01:38:44,459 --> 01:38:47,127
You're just a kid. No
one's going to hire you.

1142
01:38:47,128 --> 01:38:50,338
I'll lie about my age.
I'll tell them that I'm in middle school.

1143
01:38:50,339 --> 01:38:55,339
Do I look like a middle schooler?

1144
01:38:56,137 --> 01:38:57,054
No.

1145
01:38:57,055 --> 01:38:57,555
Really?

1146
01:39:02,143 --> 01:39:07,143
I want to grow up faster.

1147
01:39:08,316 --> 01:39:08,816
Me too.

1148
01:40:32,400 --> 01:40:33,900
Ame...

1149
01:40:33,901 --> 01:40:38,321
He's probably shivering somewhere...

1150
01:40:38,322 --> 01:40:43,322
He's probably lost... crying...

1151
01:40:43,619 --> 01:40:48,619
I have to... protect... him...

1152
01:40:51,586 --> 01:40:56,586
I have to... protect...

1153
01:41:12,398 --> 01:41:17,398
Is anyone still here?

1154
01:41:25,953 --> 01:41:30,953
He's gone.

1155
01:41:31,125 --> 01:41:36,125
My heart's still pounding.
Hey, why did we hide?

1156
01:41:37,256 --> 01:41:37,756
Hey!

1157
01:41:48,142 --> 01:41:50,185
It's like the ocean.

1158
01:41:50,186 --> 01:41:53,355
I feel like it's going to suck me in.

1159
01:41:53,356 --> 01:41:57,442
Will we really end up living here secretly?

1160
01:41:57,443 --> 01:41:59,736
If our parents don't come,
then we have no choice, do we?

1161
01:41:59,737 --> 01:42:03,365
Why? Your morn will come for sure.

1162
01:42:03,366 --> 01:42:04,658
No, she won't.

1163
01:42:04,659 --> 01:42:09,659
Why not? She's...

1164
01:42:10,289 --> 01:42:13,541
My mom got married.

1165
01:42:13,542 --> 01:42:18,542
And she's having a baby. So once it's
born, I won't be needed anymore.

1166
01:42:21,676 --> 01:42:25,053
But she was so worried about you...

1167
01:42:25,054 --> 01:42:27,472
I'm fine with that, though.

1168
01:42:27,473 --> 01:42:31,601
I'll run away from home
and become a boxer or a wrestler.

1169
01:42:31,602 --> 01:42:33,812
I'll live like a lone wolf.

1170
01:42:33,813 --> 01:42:37,399
What do you think? Will it work?

1171
01:42:37,400 --> 01:42:39,526
You'll be defeated in a second.

1172
01:42:39,527 --> 01:42:41,278
You have no muscles.

1173
01:42:41,279 --> 01:42:42,320
I'll train.

1174
01:42:42,321 --> 01:42:47,321
I'll train and live on my own.

1175
01:42:56,419 --> 01:43:00,964
Sou, I want to be like you,

1176
01:43:00,965 --> 01:43:05,965
and be able to smile
even when I'm telling the truth.

1177
01:43:19,817 --> 01:43:21,735
Sou...

1178
01:43:21,736 --> 01:43:23,028
That day,

1179
01:43:23,029 --> 01:43:28,029
the wolf that hurt you was me...

1180
01:43:31,078 --> 01:43:36,078
It was me.

1181
01:43:36,667 --> 01:43:41,667
I kept thinking that I
had to say something.

1182
01:43:42,715 --> 01:43:47,715
It hurt to hold it in.

1183
01:43:49,138 --> 01:43:52,766
I already knew. I knew the whole time.

1184
01:43:52,767 --> 01:43:57,645
I didn't tell anyone your secret.

1185
01:43:57,646 --> 01:44:01,483
I won't tell. So...

1186
01:44:01,484 --> 01:44:06,484
...don't cry anymore.

1187
01:44:07,823 --> 01:44:12,823
I'm not crying, these are drops of rain.

1188
01:44:20,711 --> 01:44:25,711
Thank you.

1189
01:44:50,157 --> 01:44:54,828
Ame... Where did you go?

1190
01:44:54,829 --> 01:44:55,329
Ame?

1191
01:44:59,583 --> 01:45:01,835
Ame.

1192
01:45:01,836 --> 01:45:03,545
I was looking for you.

1193
01:45:03,546 --> 01:45:08,546
Come on, hurry back
so we can go pick up Yuki...

1194
01:45:13,848 --> 01:45:14,348
Hana.

1195
01:45:26,819 --> 01:45:29,904
I missed you so much!

1196
01:45:29,905 --> 01:45:32,740
It's been hard, hasn't it?

1197
01:45:32,741 --> 01:45:33,741
I'm sorry.

1198
01:45:33,742 --> 01:45:36,035
It's okay.

1199
01:45:36,036 --> 01:45:39,706
I was watching you the whole time.

1200
01:45:39,707 --> 01:45:41,458
Yeah, I know.

1201
01:45:41,459 --> 01:45:43,918
You raised our children well.

1202
01:45:43,919 --> 01:45:47,422
No, that's not true. I keep messing up.

1203
01:45:47,423 --> 01:45:49,007
It's true.

1204
01:45:49,008 --> 01:45:51,426
Yuki and Ame have both grown up fine.

1205
01:45:51,427 --> 01:45:54,345
That's not true. Because...

1206
01:45:54,346 --> 01:45:58,475
Oh... Ame...

1207
01:45:58,476 --> 01:46:03,476
That's right. Ame's gone.

1208
01:46:04,231 --> 01:46:05,857
Ame!

1209
01:46:05,858 --> 01:46:07,650
Ame's fine.

1210
01:46:07,651 --> 01:46:09,611
But...

1211
01:46:09,612 --> 01:46:11,070
He's fine.

1212
01:46:11,071 --> 01:46:15,533
He's already an adult.

1213
01:46:15,534 --> 01:46:17,368
An adult?

1214
01:46:17,369 --> 01:46:22,369
He's found his own world.

1215
01:47:02,748 --> 01:47:03,248
Ame?

1216
01:47:07,002 --> 01:47:07,546
Oh, Ame!

1217
01:47:13,592 --> 01:47:18,471
Are you going to leave?

1218
01:47:18,472 --> 01:47:20,598
But...

1219
01:47:20,599 --> 01:47:25,599
I still haven't been able
to do anything for you.

1220
01:47:26,021 --> 01:47:30,066
I still haven't...

1221
01:47:30,067 --> 01:47:35,067
But you're still...

1222
01:47:43,038 --> 01:47:43,538
Wait!

1223
01:47:47,084 --> 01:47:50,211
Ame!

1224
01:47:50,212 --> 01:47:50,712
Ame...!

1225
01:47:56,135 --> 01:47:56,635
Ame...!

1226
01:48:14,570 --> 01:48:17,864
Ame...

1227
01:48:17,865 --> 01:48:18,365
Ame...

1228
01:48:48,979 --> 01:48:51,814
Be well...

1229
01:48:51,815 --> 01:48:56,815
Live a good life!

1230
01:49:14,129 --> 01:49:14,673
Goodbye.

1231
01:49:28,268 --> 01:49:33,268
Mother said that she
would never forget that morning.

1232
01:49:33,982 --> 01:49:38,486
The freshly washed beech leaves...
The freshly washed spider webs...

1233
01:49:38,487 --> 01:49:41,614
The freshly washed sky...

1234
01:49:41,615 --> 01:49:46,615
Everything glittering under the sun...
Like the world had been reborn overnight.

1235
01:49:51,041 --> 01:49:56,041
That was what Mother thought.

1236
01:50:18,861 --> 01:50:23,861
"Municipal Junior High School
Entrance Ceremony"

1237
01:50:27,369 --> 01:50:32,369
Looking back on the twelve years
she spent raising us,

1238
01:50:32,416 --> 01:50:37,170
Mother smiled, saying that it was
over in a moment, like a fairy tale.

1239
01:50:37,171 --> 01:50:42,171
"Junior High"

1240
01:50:58,650 --> 01:51:03,650
Mother is living quietly
in that mountain house even now.

1241
01:51:28,806 --> 01:51:33,806
"Ame"
"The Forest is Alive"

1242
01:51:49,576 --> 01:51:54,576
<i>"I hope to meet you soon,"</i>

1243
01:51:56,500 --> 01:52:01,500
<i>I always prayed as I rubbed my belly</i>

1244
01:52:03,632 --> 01:52:08,632
<i>(Ooh ooh) What will you look like?</i>

1245
01:52:16,728 --> 01:52:21,728
<i>(Ooh ooh) What will you sound like?</i>

1246
01:52:31,952 --> 01:52:36,952
<i>I see my reflection in your big eyes</i>

1247
01:52:38,208 --> 01:52:43,208
<i>As teardrops spill onto your cheeks</i>

1248
01:52:44,965 --> 01:52:49,965
<i>(Num nums) Come here, the food's ready!</i>

1249
01:52:57,769 --> 01:53:02,769
<i>(Pitter patter) Come on,
let's go for a walk!</i>

1250
01:53:11,450 --> 01:53:16,450
<i>Your eyes swollen, you sit
with your arms around your knees</i>

1251
01:53:17,998 --> 01:53:22,998
<i>Tell me why you're crying,
tell me everything</i>

1252
01:53:24,671 --> 01:53:29,671
<i>Don't worry, I'm not going anywhere</i>

1253
01:53:30,886 --> 01:53:35,886
<i>No matter what happens, we'll be together</i>

1254
01:53:37,351 --> 01:53:42,351
<i>I love your smiling face</i>

1255
01:53:43,649 --> 01:53:48,649
<i>It makes me feel better, even when I'm down</i>

1256
01:53:50,030 --> 01:53:55,030
<i>(Lalala lalala) Come here, let's sing!</i>

1257
01:54:02,167 --> 01:54:07,167
<i>(Aroo aroo) Come on,
let's raise our voices together!</i>

1258
01:54:14,805 --> 01:54:19,805
<i>I want you to grow up brightly and freely</i>

1259
01:54:28,735 --> 01:54:33,735
<i>Running in the snow, counting clouds</i>

1260
01:54:34,491 --> 01:54:39,491
<i>Playing in the rain,
being blown by the wind</i>

1261
01:54:40,372 --> 01:54:45,372
<i>Buried under flowers, playing grass kazoos</i>

1262
01:54:46,044 --> 01:54:51,044
<i>On four feet, on two feet</i>

1263
01:54:52,009 --> 01:54:54,969
<i>A new morning</i>

1264
01:54:54,970 --> 01:54:57,680
<i>A new wind</i>

1265
01:54:57,681 --> 01:55:02,681
<i>Prepared just for you</i>

1266
01:55:03,437 --> 01:55:06,188
<i>A new morning</i>

1267
01:55:06,189 --> 01:55:09,025
<i>A new light</i>

1268
01:55:09,026 --> 01:55:14,026
<i>The world is yours for the taking</i>

1269
01:55:14,656 --> 01:55:17,491
<i>A new morning</i>

1270
01:55:17,492 --> 01:55:20,369
<i>A new rainbow</i>

1271
01:55:20,370 --> 01:55:25,370
<i>The world is full of mystery</i>

1272
01:55:26,084 --> 01:55:31,084
<i>Choosing one of two paths,
eyes fixed on</i> a <i>point far</i> away

1273
01:55:45,103 --> 01:55:50,103
<i>Is there nothing else I can do for you?</i>

1274
01:56:00,368 --> 01:56:05,368
<i>Whenever you decide to leave,
I will see you off with a smile</i>

1275
01:56:18,470 --> 01:56:23,470
<i>(Ooh ooh) But I'll still be a little sad</i>

1276
01:56:30,190 --> 01:56:35,190
<i>(Aroo aroo) Please, live a good life</i>
