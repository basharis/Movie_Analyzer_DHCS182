1
00:02:16,542 --> 00:02:18,625
- Evening, Mr. Godby.
- Wotcher.

2
00:02:19,542 --> 00:02:21,667
- Hello, Hello, Hello.
- Quite a stranger, aren't you?

3
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:24,708
- I couldn't get in yesterday.
- I wondered what had happened to you.

4
00:02:24,792 --> 00:02:26,792
- I had a bit of a dust up.
- What about?

5
00:02:26,833 --> 00:02:27,917
A chap got out
of first class...

6
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:30,958
with a third class ticket.

7
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,125
He wouldn't pay excess; turned
nasty. I had to send for Mr Saunders.

8
00:02:34,167 --> 00:02:36,167
- Fat lot of good he'd be.
- He ticked him off.

9
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:39,375
- Seeing's believing.
- He ticked him off proper.

10
00:02:39,458 --> 00:02:42,500
"Pay the balance at once" he says
"or I'll get the police. "

11
00:02:42,542 --> 00:02:45,625
You should've seen his face at
the word " police".

12
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:48,583
Changed his tune.
Paid up like lightening.

13
00:02:48,667 --> 00:02:50,750
Exactly, he couldn't
handle it himself.

14
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:52,875
He had to call the police.

15
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:54,917
He's not a bad lot, Saunders.

16
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:59,042
After all, he's only got one lung
and a wife with diabetes.

17
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:01,167
I thought something was wrong
when you didn't come.

18
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:04,333
I'd have come to explain, but
I had a date and had to run.

19
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:05,500
Indeed!

20
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:09,417
- A chap I know is getting married.
- Very interesting, I'm sure.

21
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:13,833
- What's up with you?
- I dont know what you mean.

22
00:03:14,667 --> 00:03:16,875
- You're a bit unfriendly.
- Beryl, hurry up.

23
00:03:17,792 --> 00:03:19,917
- Put some more coal in the stove.
- Yes, Mrs. Bagot.

24
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:23,208
I can't stand here wasting my time
in idle gossip, Mr. Godby.

25
00:03:24,042 --> 00:03:25,125
What about another cup?

26
00:03:25,167 --> 00:03:27,250
You can have another cup
when you finish that one.

27
00:03:27,292 --> 00:03:30,333
Beryl will give it to you.
I've got my accounts to do.

28
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:35,583
- I'd rather you gave it to me.
- Time and tide wait for no man.

29
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:40,667
- Laura! What a lovely surprise.
- Oh. Dolly!

30
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:44,833
I've been shopping till I'm dropping.
My throat's parched.

31
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:48,042
I'd have had tea in Spindle's but
didn't want to miss the train.

32
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:51,083
- Dear!
- This is Doctor Harvey.

33
00:03:51,292 --> 00:03:52,250
How do you do.

34
00:03:52,292 --> 00:03:56,500
Get me my cup of tea would you?
I can't drag my bones to the counter.

35
00:03:57,417 --> 00:03:58,500
No please...

36
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:04,625
What a nice looking man. Who is he?
You're a dark horse.

37
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:06,750
I'll phone Fred in the morning
and make mischief.

38
00:04:07,792 --> 00:04:10,917
This is a bit of luck.
I haven't seen you for ages.

39
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,042
I meant to pop in
but Tony had measles...

40
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:16,208
Then I'd that fuss over Phyllis.
You don't know.

41
00:04:16,292 --> 00:04:18,333
- She left me.
- Dreadful.

42
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:22,375
I never really liked her,
but Tony adored her.

43
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:26,500
I'll tell you later in the train.
Thank you.

44
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:29,875
There's certainly enough milk in it,
but it'll be refreshing.

45
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:35,875
- Oh dear. No sugar.
- It's in the spoon.

46
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:38,083
Of course.
What a fool I am.

47
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:42,125
Laura you're looking well.
If I knew you were coming...

48
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:46,333
we could've had lunch and a gossip.
I loathe shopping by myself.

49
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,583
- There's your train.
- Yes, I know.

50
00:04:50,667 --> 00:04:53,583
- Aren't you coming with us?
- No, I go in the opposite direction.

51
00:04:53,667 --> 00:04:54,833
- My practice is in Churley.
- I see.

52
00:04:55,667 --> 00:04:56,750
I'm a general practitioner.

53
00:04:56,875 --> 00:04:58,875
Dr. Harvey's going to Africa
next week.

54
00:04:58,917 --> 00:05:00,000
How thrilling.

55
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:05,125
...the 5.40 for Churley,
Leigh Green and Langdon.

56
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:06,292
- I must go.
- Yes, you must.

57
00:05:07,167 --> 00:05:08,333
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

58
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,958
He'll have to run or he'll miss it.
It's on the other platform.

59
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:27,083
Talking of missing trains reminds me
of the bridge at Broadham junction.

60
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:30,250
You've got to traipse up one side,
and down the other.

61
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:34,333
The other day I'd been to see
Bob's solicitor...

62
00:05:35,292 --> 00:05:40,500
I got to the station with only
half a minute to spare. I flew.

63
00:05:40,542 --> 00:05:43,833
I was with Tony and I'd bought
a new lampshade...

64
00:05:44,667 --> 00:05:45,917
I could've got it
here in Milford.

65
00:05:46,792 --> 00:05:49,000
It was enormous.

66
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:53,125
I couldn't see over it.
I nearly knocked a woman down.

67
00:05:54,167 --> 00:05:57,125
When I got home
it was battered to bits.

68
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:01,458
Is that our train?
Is that the Ketchworth train?

69
00:06:01,542 --> 00:06:03,583
- No, it's the express.
- The boat train.

70
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:05,667
That doesn't stop, does it?

71
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:08,625
- I want some chocolate, please.
- Milk or plain?

72
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:10,708
Plain, I think.

73
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,958
No, milk would be nicer.
Anything with nuts in it?

74
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,042
Nestle's nut milk.

75
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:17,167
One plain and one nut milk.

76
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:20,125
- Large or small?
- Large please.

77
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,667
Where is she?

78
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:34,792
I never noticed her go.

79
00:06:36,917 --> 00:06:39,042
I couldn't think where you'd
disappeared to.

80
00:06:40,042 --> 00:06:42,125
I wanted to see the express
go through.

81
00:06:43,167 --> 00:06:45,250
What's the matter?
Are you feeling ill?

82
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:48,333
- I feel a little sick.
- Come and sit down.

83
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:54,542
There's our train.

84
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:56,625
- Have you any brandy?
- It's out of hours.

85
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:58,792
- Surely if somebody's ill.
- I'm all right.

86
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:01,750
Brandy will buck you up.
Please.

87
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:02,958
Very well.

88
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:05,083
- How much?
- Tenpence please.

89
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:11,250
The train for Ketchworth
is now arriving at platform 3.

90
00:07:11,292 --> 00:07:13,292
We have to hurry.

91
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,750
This is a bit of luck.

92
00:07:25,792 --> 00:07:27,875
This train
is generally packed.

93
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I'm really worried about you.
You look terribly peaky.

94
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:35,167
I'm all right.
I just felt faint.

95
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:39,375
It happens. I did it once at Bobbie's
concert. He's never forgiven me.

96
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:43,542
He certainly was good looking.

97
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:46,500
- Who?
- Your friend. Dr. Whats-his-name.

98
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:50,708
- Yes, he's a nice creature.
- Have you known him long?

99
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:51,917
No, not very long.

100
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,917
- I hardly know him at all.
- My dear!

101
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,042
I've always loved doctors.

102
00:07:58,083 --> 00:08:01,083
I can well understand how it is that
women get neurotic...

103
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:04,292
I wish I could trust you.

104
00:08:05,417 --> 00:08:07,542
I wish you were
a wise kind friend...

105
00:08:08,542 --> 00:08:13,583
instead of a gossip I've known for
years and never really cared for.

106
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,875
I wish... I wish...

107
00:08:16,917 --> 00:08:19,875
Fancy him going to Africa.
Is he married?

108
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,042
- Yes.
- Any children?

109
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:23,125
Yes, 2 boys. He's
very proud of them.

110
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:26,167
Is he taking them with him?
Wife and children?

111
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:27,292
Yes, he is.

112
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:29,417
I suppose it's sensible...

113
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,583
starting life anew
in the wide open space but...

114
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,583
wild horses wouldn't drag me away
from England and home...

115
00:08:35,667 --> 00:08:37,708
and all the things I'm used to.

116
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:40,708
One has one's roots hasn't one?

117
00:08:40,792 --> 00:08:41,958
Yes, one has one's roots.

118
00:08:42,792 --> 00:08:43,875
I knew a girl
who went to Africa.

119
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:46,917
Her husband
worked in engineering...

120
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,083
She had the most dreadful time.

121
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:52,333
She got some awful kind of germ
and was ill for months...

122
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,250
I wish you'd stop talking.

123
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,458
I wish you'd stop prying and trying
to find things out.

124
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:02,708
I wish you were dead. No, not that.
That was silly and unkind.

125
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:06,833
- But I wish you'd stop talking.
- All her hair came out...

126
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:09,833
and she said the social life
was quite horrid...

127
00:09:09,917 --> 00:09:11,917
Provincial and
very nouveau riche.

128
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:14,042
- Oh Dolly.
- Are you feeling ill again?

129
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:16,167
A bit dizzy.

130
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:18,333
- I'll close my eyes for a bit.
- Poor darling...

131
00:09:18,417 --> 00:09:20,375
Here am I chatting away.

132
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:22,458
I won't say another word.

133
00:09:22,542 --> 00:09:26,458
If you drop off I'll wake you up
at the level crossing.

134
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:28,750
You can powder your nose
before we get out.

135
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:30,750
Thanks, Dolly.

136
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:37,042
This can't last.

137
00:09:39,167 --> 00:09:41,208
This misery can't last.

138
00:09:42,292 --> 00:09:44,417
I must remember that
and try to control myself.

139
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:47,542
Nothing lasts really...

140
00:09:48,417 --> 00:09:50,458
neither happiness nor despair.

141
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:52,667
Not even life lasts very long.

142
00:09:53,792 --> 00:09:56,875
There'll come a time when I shan't
mind about this anymore...

143
00:09:57,958 --> 00:10:02,042
when I can look back and say
cheerfully: "How silly I was".

144
00:10:04,167 --> 00:10:06,333
I don't want that time
to come ever.

145
00:10:08,292 --> 00:10:10,333
I want to remember
every minute...

146
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:12,542
always...

147
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,583
always, to the end of my days.

148
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:21,750
- Ketchworth!
- Wake up. Laura. We're here.

149
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:22,917
Ketchworth!

150
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:26,958
I could take you home.
It isn't out of my way.

151
00:10:27,167 --> 00:10:31,083
I'll go down Elmore Lane
and I'll be home in two minutes.

152
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:34,250
It's sweet of you but
I'm perfectly all right now.

153
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:37,375
- You're quite sure?
- Positive. Thank you.

154
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:41,667
Nonsense. I'll phone you
to see if you've had a relapse.

155
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,750
I shall disappoint you.
Good night.

156
00:10:43,792 --> 00:10:46,792
Goodnight. Give my love
to Fred and the children.

157
00:10:57,292 --> 00:10:59,250
Is that you Laura?

158
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:02,333
- Yes, dear.
- Thank goodness you're back.

159
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:04,500
- The place has been in an uproar.
- What's the matter?

160
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:06,542
Bobbie and Margaret,
fighting again.

161
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:08,750
They won't go to sleep
until you talk to them.

162
00:11:08,792 --> 00:11:10,875
Mummy?
Is that you Mummy?

163
00:11:10,917 --> 00:11:13,875
- Yes, Margaret.
- Come upstairs at once, Mummy.

164
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:15,042
I want to talk to you.

165
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:24,333
You're both very naughty.
You should be asleep.

166
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:26,500
- Now what is it?
- Well Mummy...

167
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:30,500
tomorrow's my birthday and
I want to go to the Circus.

168
00:11:30,542 --> 00:11:33,750
Tomorrow's not Margaret's birthday
and she wants to go to the Pantomime.

169
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:36,833
My birthday's in June. There aren't
any pantomimes in June.

170
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:40,875
It's too late to discuss it.
Now go to sleep at once...

171
00:11:40,917 --> 00:11:43,000
or you won't go to either.

172
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:44,083
Oh Mummy!

173
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:47,333
Why not take them to both? One in
the afternoon and one in the evening?

174
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:52,417
That's impossible. We'd get to bed
late, tired and fractious.

175
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:55,500
One on one day,
the other on the other.

176
00:11:56,542 --> 00:11:58,625
You accuse me
of spoiling the children.

177
00:11:58,667 --> 00:12:01,833
Their characters would be ruined
if it was up to you.

178
00:12:01,917 --> 00:12:03,958
All right, have it
your own way.

179
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:07,167
- Circus or Pantomime?
- Neither.

180
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,167
We'll thrash them, lock them
in the attic and go the pictures.

181
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:18,458
Oh Fred.

182
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:23,542
- What on earth's the matter?
- Nothing. It's nothing.

183
00:12:24,667 --> 00:12:26,875
Darling, what's wrong?
Tell me, please.

184
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:29,833
Really, it's nothing...

185
00:12:29,917 --> 00:12:31,958
I'm run down that's all.

186
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:35,250
I nearly fainted at
the refreshment room at Milford.

187
00:12:35,292 --> 00:12:37,292
Isn't it idiotic?

188
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:40,250
Dolly Messiter was
with me and she talked...

189
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:43,417
until I wanted to strangle her.
But she meant to be kind.

190
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:46,583
Isn't it awful about people
meaning to be kind.

191
00:12:46,667 --> 00:12:49,708
- Would you like to go to bed?
- No Fred, really.

192
00:12:50,792 --> 00:12:52,875
Come and sit
by the fire and relax.

193
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:55,083
You can help me
with the crossword.

194
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:58,167
You have the most peculiar
ideas of relaxation.

195
00:13:00,167 --> 00:13:02,167
- There you are, darling.
- Thank you.

196
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,333
But why a fainting spell?
I can't understand it.

197
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:09,458
Don't be silly. I've often had
fainting spells.

198
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,667
You remember
Bobbie's school concert...

199
00:13:11,542 --> 00:13:12,625
and Eileen's wedding...

200
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:15,792
and when you took me to the
Symphony concert at the Town Hall?

201
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:17,917
That was a nose bleed.

202
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:21,125
I suppose I must be that type of
woman. It's very humiliating.

203
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,167
There'd be no harm in
you seeing Dr. Graves.

204
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:26,167
It would be a waste of time.

205
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:29,417
- Now listen...
- Shut up. Don't make a fuss.

206
00:13:30,417 --> 00:13:34,583
I'd been shopping and was tired
and it was hot and I felt sick.

207
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:35,583
Nothing more than that.

208
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:38,833
- All right.
- Really nothing.

209
00:13:39,667 --> 00:13:41,792
Get on with your puzzle
and leave me in peace.

210
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:43,792
Have it your own way.

211
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:48,000
You're a poetry addict.
See if you can help me out.

212
00:13:48,042 --> 00:13:50,250
It's Keats. "I behold upon
the night starred face...

213
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:54,208
huge cloudy symbols of a high... "
7 letters.

214
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:58,417
"Romance", I think.
I'm almost sure.

215
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:01,625
"Huge cloudy symbols
of a high romance".

216
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:03,667
It'll be in the Oxford.

217
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:06,750
No, it's right. It fits in.

218
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,083
- Would music put you off?
- No, dear, I'd like it.

219
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:18,625
Fred...

220
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:20,792
Fred...

221
00:15:21,917 --> 00:15:23,833
dear Fred.

222
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:27,083
There's so much I want to say.

223
00:15:28,167 --> 00:15:32,375
You're the only one with the wisdom
and gentleness to understand...

224
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:36,375
if only it were somebody
else's story and not mine.

225
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:40,625
You are the only one in the world
that I can never tell.

226
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,625
Never, never.

227
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:47,958
Because even if I waited until we
were old and told you then...

228
00:15:48,917 --> 00:15:51,917
you'd look back over the years
and be hurt.

229
00:15:53,042 --> 00:15:55,167
I don't want you to be hurt.

230
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:57,333
You see...

231
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:00,375
we're a happily
married couple...

232
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:02,500
and must never forget that.

233
00:16:03,542 --> 00:16:05,500
This is my home.

234
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:07,750
You are my husband...

235
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:10,708
and my children
are upstairs in bed.

236
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:13,833
I am a happily
married woman...

237
00:16:14,917 --> 00:16:17,042
or I was until
a few weeks ago.

238
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:21,167
This is my whole world...

239
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:23,167
and it's enough...

240
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:25,500
or it was until a few weeks ago.

241
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:30,583
I've been so foolish.

242
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:33,583
I've fallen in love.

243
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:35,750
I'm an ordinary woman.

244
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:39,958
I didn't think such violent things
happened to ordinary people.

245
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:44,167
It all started
on an ordinary day...

246
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:47,333
in an ordinary place...

247
00:16:48,292 --> 00:16:50,417
The Refreshment Room
at Milford Junction.

248
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:56,542
I was having a cup of tea and reading
a book that I'd got from Boots.

249
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:58,667
My train wasn't due
for ten minutes.

250
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:02,875
I looked up and saw a man
come in from the platform.

251
00:17:03,917 --> 00:17:08,042
In an ordinary mac, and hat.
I didn't even see his face.

252
00:17:09,042 --> 00:17:10,292
He got his tea and turned...

253
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:13,250
and then I did see his face.
A nice face.

254
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,417
- Any sugar?
- In the spoon.

255
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:17,583
He passed by my table
on the way to his.

256
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,625
The woman
was going on as usual.

257
00:17:21,667 --> 00:17:23,708
I told you about her
the other day...

258
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:25,667
the one with the refined voice.

259
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,958
- Minnie hasn't touched her milk.
- Did you put it down for her?

260
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,042
Yes, but she never came for it.

261
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:33,083
- Fond of animals?
- In their place.

262
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:36,125
My landlady's mad for animals.

263
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:38,333
She's got two cats,
one manx, one ordinary...

264
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:42,292
three rabbits in the kitchen.
They belong to her little boy.

265
00:17:42,417 --> 00:17:44,667
And one of those daft looking
dogs with hair over its eyes.

266
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:49,667
- I don't know what breed you mean.
- I don't think it knows itself.

267
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:54,000
Go and clean Number 3, Beryl. I can
see the crumbs on it from here.

268
00:17:54,042 --> 00:17:58,125
And my other cup? I have to go.
The 5:40 will be here in a minute.

269
00:17:58,208 --> 00:18:01,083
- Who's on the gate?
- Young William.

270
00:18:27,292 --> 00:18:30,500
A glass of water please.
I've something in my eye.

271
00:18:32,542 --> 00:18:36,708
- Would you like me to have a look?
- Don't trouble. The water will do.

272
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,625
Bit of coal dust, I expect.

273
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:41,833
A man I knew lost an eye
by getting a bit of grit in it.

274
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:43,875
- Nasty, very nasty.
- Better?

275
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,125
- I'm afraid not. Oh!
- Can I help you?

276
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:49,083
No. Just something
in my eye.

277
00:18:49,167 --> 00:18:51,333
Pull your eyelid down..

278
00:18:52,167 --> 00:18:53,417
- And then blow your nose.
- Please let me look.

279
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:56,333
- I happen to be a doctor.
- It's very kind of you.

280
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:58,458
Turn round to the light please.

281
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:00,625
Now look up...

282
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,708
now look down...

283
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:07,958
Keep still. I see it.

284
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,167
- There!
- What a relief. It was agonising.

285
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:15,208
- It looks like a bit of grit.
- It was when the express went through.

286
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:18,250
- Thank you very much indeed.
- There we go. I must run.

287
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:20,375
- Lucky for me you were here.
- Anybody could have done it.

288
00:19:20,417 --> 00:19:23,542
- Never mind, you did, I'm grateful.
- That's my train. I must go. Goodbye.

289
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:25,458
Goodbye.

290
00:19:29,792 --> 00:19:31,750
That's how it all began.

291
00:19:31,917 --> 00:19:34,875
Just through me getting
a bit of grit in my eye.

292
00:19:35,917 --> 00:19:39,083
I completely forgot about it.
It didn't mean anything to me at all.

293
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:43,208
At least I didn't think it did.

294
00:19:48,583 --> 00:19:51,583
The next Thursday
I went into Milford as usual.

295
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:03,125
I changed my book at Boots.

296
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:06,292
Miss Lewis had at last managed to
get the new Kate O'brien for me.

297
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:09,333
She kept it hidden
under the counter for two days.

298
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:12,542
On the way out I bought two
new toothbrushes for the children.

299
00:20:13,417 --> 00:20:15,542
I like the smell of a chemist's.

300
00:20:15,667 --> 00:20:17,583
It's such a nice mixture
of nice things...

301
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:19,708
herbs and scent and soap.

302
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:24,833
Mrs. Leptwich was there, in one of
the silliest hats I've ever seen.

303
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:27,000
Fortunately she didn't look up.

304
00:20:27,042 --> 00:20:29,042
I got out without her
buttonholing me.

305
00:20:30,167 --> 00:20:31,333
Just as I stepped
onto the pavement...

306
00:20:32,167 --> 00:20:33,333
- Good morning.
- Oh, good morning.

307
00:20:33,417 --> 00:20:35,292
- How's the eye?
- Perfectly all right.

308
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:38,417
- How kind it was of you.
- It was nothing at all.

309
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:40,667
- It's clearing up I think.
- Yes, it's going to be nice.

310
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:44,708
- Well I must get to the hospital.
- And I must get to the grocer's.

311
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,917
- What exciting lives we lead.
- Goodbye.

312
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:52,083
That evening I had to run
to the station.

313
00:20:53,042 --> 00:20:57,167
I'd been to the Palladium.
It was a long film and I was late.

314
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:01,500
As I came to the platform, the
Churley train was just puffing out.

315
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:05,542
I looked up
as the carriages went by...

316
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:07,583
wondering if he was there.

317
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:10,708
I remember it crossed my mind,
but it was quite unimportant.

318
00:21:10,792 --> 00:21:12,792
I was thinking of other things.

319
00:21:12,917 --> 00:21:15,875
The present for your birthday
was worrying me rather.

320
00:21:16,042 --> 00:21:18,208
It was terribly expensive
but I knew you wanted it.

321
00:21:19,042 --> 00:21:20,208
And I'd sort of half taken
the plunge...

322
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:24,250
and left a deposit on it at Spink
& Robson's until next Thursday.

323
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:26,458
The next Thursday...

324
00:21:28,417 --> 00:21:31,750
I squared my conscience by thinking
how pleased you'd be and bought it.

325
00:21:32,542 --> 00:21:33,708
- Yes, I'll have it.
- Thank you, Madam.

326
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:36,875
It was extravagant but
I'd committed the crime...

327
00:21:36,917 --> 00:21:38,917
and I felt reckless and gay.

328
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:41,042
The sun was out.

329
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:44,083
Everyone looked
more cheerful than usual.

330
00:21:44,167 --> 00:21:48,333
There was a barrel organ at the
corner and I love barrel organs.

331
00:21:48,417 --> 00:21:51,458
It was playing "Let the great big
world keep turning".

332
00:21:51,542 --> 00:21:53,500
I gave the man sixpence...

333
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:55,583
and went to Kardomah
for lunch.

334
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:59,750
It was very full but two people got
up from a table just as I came in.

335
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:03,833
A bit of luck wasn't it?
Or was it?

336
00:22:04,042 --> 00:22:07,042
Just after I had given my order,
I saw him come in.

337
00:22:07,083 --> 00:22:10,208
He looked tired, and there was
nowhere for him to sit.

338
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:12,292
So I smiled and said:
Good morning.

339
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:15,375
Good morning.
Are you all alone?

340
00:22:15,458 --> 00:22:16,458
Yes, I am.

341
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,417
Could I share your table? It's very
full and there's nowhere else.

342
00:22:19,458 --> 00:22:20,625
Of course not.

343
00:22:24,708 --> 00:22:25,875
I'm afraid we haven't been
introduced properly.

344
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:28,958
- My name's Alec Harvey.
- How do you do.

345
00:22:29,042 --> 00:22:31,125
- Mine's Laura Jesson.
- Mrs. Or Miss?

346
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:35,125
Mrs. You're a doctor, aren't you?
You said so in the Refreshment Room.

347
00:22:35,208 --> 00:22:39,417
Yes. Not an interesting one, a G.P.
My practice is in Churley.

348
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:42,500
- Yes, sir?
- What did you plump for?

349
00:22:43,542 --> 00:22:45,625
The soup and fried sole.

350
00:22:45,667 --> 00:22:47,750
- Yes, I'll have the same.
- Anything to drink?

351
00:22:48,583 --> 00:22:50,667
No, thank you.
Would you like anything to drink?

352
00:22:50,917 --> 00:22:53,875
- No, just plain water, please.
- Plain water, please.

353
00:23:03,208 --> 00:23:04,458
Do look at the cellist.

354
00:23:12,708 --> 00:23:16,792
It really is dreadful, isn't it? But
we oughtn't laugh. They might see.

355
00:23:16,833 --> 00:23:18,875
There should be a society
for the prevention...

356
00:23:18,958 --> 00:23:21,958
of cruelty to musical instruments.
You don't play the piano, I hope.

357
00:23:22,042 --> 00:23:24,042
- I was forced to as a child.
- You haven't kept it up.

358
00:23:24,083 --> 00:23:27,125
- No, my husband isn't musical at all.
- Good for him.

359
00:23:27,208 --> 00:23:29,333
For all you know, I might have a
tremendous professional talent.

360
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:32,417
- Oh dear, no.
- Why are you so sure?

361
00:23:32,542 --> 00:23:34,500
You're too sane
and uncomplicated.

362
00:23:35,708 --> 00:23:38,833
I suppose it's a good thing,
but it does sound a little dull.

363
00:23:39,667 --> 00:23:40,833
You could never be dull.

364
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:45,917
- Do you come here every Thursday?
- Yes, I spend the day at the hospital.

365
00:23:46,042 --> 00:23:49,042
Stephen Lynn, the chief physician
graduated with me.

366
00:23:49,083 --> 00:23:52,167
I take over for him once a week.
He goes up to London...

367
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:54,458
- and I study the hospital patients.
- I see.

368
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:56,333
Do you?

369
00:23:56,458 --> 00:23:58,542
- Do I what?
- Come here every Thursday?

370
00:23:59,625 --> 00:24:01,708
Yes. I do the week's shopping.

371
00:24:02,583 --> 00:24:05,792
Change my library book, have lunch
and generally go to the pictures.

372
00:24:05,833 --> 00:24:07,958
Not a very exciting routine
but it makes a change.

373
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,958
Are you going to the pictures
this afternoon?

374
00:24:12,042 --> 00:24:13,000
Yes.

375
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,083
How extraordinary.
So am I.

376
00:24:16,292 --> 00:24:18,250
I thought you had to spend all day
at the hospital.

377
00:24:18,292 --> 00:24:21,500
Between us, I killed 2 patients
this morning...

378
00:24:22,333 --> 00:24:25,625
and Matron's displeased.
I simply daren't go back.

379
00:24:26,542 --> 00:24:27,542
How can you be so silly?

380
00:24:27,625 --> 00:24:29,750
I got through most
of my work this morning.

381
00:24:29,833 --> 00:24:32,958
Would you mind if I came
to the pictures with you?

382
00:24:34,917 --> 00:24:38,000
- Well, I...
- I'll sit downstairs and you upstairs.

383
00:24:38,042 --> 00:24:40,042
Upstairs is too expensive.

384
00:24:42,292 --> 00:24:44,417
The orchestra stopped as abruptly
as it had started...

385
00:24:44,458 --> 00:24:48,375
and we laughed again.
I had no premonitions...

386
00:24:48,458 --> 00:24:51,667
although I suppose I should've had.
It all seemed so natural and innocent.

387
00:24:52,708 --> 00:24:55,917
We finished lunch and the idiot of a
waitress had put the bill all on one.

388
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:58,792
- I really must insist.
- I couldn't possibly.

389
00:24:58,875 --> 00:25:01,083
Having forced my company on you,
it's only fair that I pay for it.

390
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:05,208
Please don't insist. I would much
rather we halved it. Please.

391
00:25:06,167 --> 00:25:09,333
- I shall give in gracefully.
- We halved it meticulously.

392
00:25:10,458 --> 00:25:12,542
We even halved the tip.

393
00:25:21,958 --> 00:25:22,958
Thank you.

394
00:25:25,083 --> 00:25:26,917
We have two choices.

395
00:25:26,958 --> 00:25:28,125
"The Loves of Cardinal Richelieu"
at the Palace, or...

396
00:25:29,042 --> 00:25:30,208
- "Love in a Mist" at the Palladium.
- You're very knowledgeable.

397
00:25:30,292 --> 00:25:33,417
There must be no argument about the
tickets. We each pay for ourselves.

398
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:36,458
You must think me a poor doctor if
I can't afford a couple of tickets!

399
00:25:36,542 --> 00:25:38,583
- I insist.
- I hoped you were going to treat me!

400
00:25:38,625 --> 00:25:41,583
- Which is it to be: Palace or Palladium?
- Palladium.

401
00:25:41,625 --> 00:25:44,792
I was once very sick on a steamer
called "Cardinal Richelieu".

402
00:26:29,542 --> 00:26:31,667
I feel awfully grand perched up here.
It was very extravagant of you.

403
00:26:31,708 --> 00:26:34,708
- It was a famous victory.
- Do you feel guilty at all? I do.

404
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:35,075
Guilty?

405
00:26:35,708 --> 00:26:37,833
You ought to more than me. You
neglected your work this afternoon.

406
00:26:37,958 --> 00:26:41,958
I worked this morning. A little
relaxation never harmed anyone.

407
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,167
Why should we feel guilty?

408
00:26:44,083 --> 00:26:47,125
- I don't know.
- How awfully nice you are.

409
00:27:00,917 --> 00:27:01,917
It can't be.

410
00:27:04,042 --> 00:27:05,958
It is.

411
00:27:09,208 --> 00:27:11,250
We walked
to the station together.

412
00:27:12,167 --> 00:27:14,417
Just as we reached the gate,
he put his hand under my arm.

413
00:27:15,375 --> 00:27:18,542
I didn't notice it then but
I remember it now.

414
00:27:18,625 --> 00:27:21,583
- What's she like, your wife?
- Madelaine?

415
00:27:21,667 --> 00:27:24,708
Small, dark,
rather delicate.

416
00:27:24,792 --> 00:27:26,833
How funny. I thought
she would've been fair.

417
00:27:26,875 --> 00:27:28,875
And your husband,
what's he like?

418
00:27:28,917 --> 00:27:30,917
Medium height,
brown hair...

419
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,167
kindly, unemotional
and not delicate at all.

420
00:27:33,208 --> 00:27:36,083
- You said that proudly.
- Did I?

421
00:27:36,125 --> 00:27:37,208
- Good evening.
- Evening.

422
00:27:38,208 --> 00:27:40,333
We've just got time for a cup
of tea before our trains go.

423
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:42,542
For the third time in a week
he brought...

424
00:27:43,417 --> 00:27:46,542
a man and wife home without
so much as a by your leave.

425
00:27:46,583 --> 00:27:49,625
- Two teas, please.
- Cake or pastry?

426
00:27:49,708 --> 00:27:51,792
- Cake or pastry?
- No thank you.

427
00:27:51,833 --> 00:27:54,875
- Are those Bath buns fresh?
- Certainly. Made this morning.

428
00:27:54,958 --> 00:27:56,042
Two please.

429
00:27:58,125 --> 00:28:00,083
That'll be sevenpence.

430
00:28:01,208 --> 00:28:04,250
- Take the tea to the table, Beryl.
- I'll carry the buns.

431
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,708
- You must eat one of these.
- Very fattening.

432
00:28:12,542 --> 00:28:13,625
I don't hold
with such foolishness.

433
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:17,833
- They do look good, I must say.
- One of my earliest passions in life.

434
00:28:17,917 --> 00:28:20,875
- What happened then Mrs Bagot?
- Well...

435
00:28:21,083 --> 00:28:22,167
It's all very fine...

436
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,208
expecting me to do this
that and the other.

437
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:30,333
But you can't expect me to be a cook
and housekeeper during the day...

438
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:32,583
and a loving wife in the evening.
Just because you feel like it.

439
00:28:33,417 --> 00:28:36,542
There are as good fish
in the sea...

440
00:28:36,625 --> 00:28:40,667
as ever came out of it.
I packed my boxes and left him.

441
00:28:40,708 --> 00:28:41,875
Didn't you never go back?

442
00:28:41,958 --> 00:28:46,000
Never. I went to my sister's
at Folkstone for a bit...

443
00:28:46,042 --> 00:28:49,208
then I opened
a tea shop in Hathe.

444
00:28:50,083 --> 00:28:51,167
And what happened to him?

445
00:28:51,208 --> 00:28:54,292
- Dad as a doornail in three years.
- Well, I never.

446
00:28:56,458 --> 00:28:58,542
Is tea bad for one?
Worse than coffee?

447
00:28:59,583 --> 00:29:01,708
If this is a professional interview
my fee is a guinee.

448
00:29:02,625 --> 00:29:05,708
- Why did you become a doctor?
- That's a long story...

449
00:29:05,917 --> 00:29:10,042
- Perhaps because I'm an idealist.
- All doctors should have ideals...

450
00:29:10,083 --> 00:29:13,167
- or their work would be unbearable.
- Don't encourage me to talk shop.

451
00:29:14,042 --> 00:29:16,125
Why not?
It's what interests you.

452
00:29:16,167 --> 00:29:17,250
Yes, it is.

453
00:29:17,333 --> 00:29:19,417
I'm terribly ambitious really.

454
00:29:19,458 --> 00:29:22,458
Not for myself,
for my special pigeon.

455
00:29:22,542 --> 00:29:24,542
- What's your special pigeon?
- Preventative medicine.

456
00:29:25,583 --> 00:29:28,625
- I see.
- I'm afraid you don't.

457
00:29:28,667 --> 00:29:31,708
- I was trying to be intelligent.
- Most good doctors...

458
00:29:31,792 --> 00:29:35,042
have private dreams.
It's the best part of them.

459
00:29:35,083 --> 00:29:38,208
But sometimes they get strangulated.
Am I boring you?

460
00:29:39,042 --> 00:29:41,167
No. I don't quite understand
but you're not boring me.

461
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:44,417
What I mean is this...
All good doctors must primarily...

462
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:46,333
be enthusiasts.

463
00:29:46,417 --> 00:29:50,583
They must like writers and painters,
have a sense of vocation.

464
00:29:51,625 --> 00:29:54,625
A deep-rooted desire
to do good.

465
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:55,750
Yes, I see that.

466
00:29:55,833 --> 00:29:58,875
Obviously one way of preventing
disease is worth 50 ways of curing.

467
00:29:58,917 --> 00:30:00,875
That's where my ideal comes in.

468
00:30:00,917 --> 00:30:03,000
Preventative medicine isn't
anything to do with medicine...

469
00:30:03,083 --> 00:30:07,167
but with living conditions,
hygiene and common sense.

470
00:30:07,333 --> 00:30:09,333
My speciality is pneumoconiosis.

471
00:30:10,333 --> 00:30:11,417
Oh dear.

472
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:14,458
Don't be alarmed.
It's simpler than it sounds.

473
00:30:14,583 --> 00:30:16,708
It's a slow process
of fibrosis of the lung...

474
00:30:17,542 --> 00:30:18,792
due to inhalation of dust.

475
00:30:19,708 --> 00:30:23,917
Here, there are splendid
opportunities, because of the mines.

476
00:30:23,958 --> 00:30:27,042
- You suddenly look much younger.
- Do I?

477
00:30:28,125 --> 00:30:31,333
- Almost like a little boy.
- What made you say that?

478
00:30:33,292 --> 00:30:34,375
I don't know...

479
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:36,458
Yes, I do.

480
00:30:37,417 --> 00:30:38,500
Tell me.

481
00:30:39,583 --> 00:30:43,625
No, I couldn't really. You were
saying about the coal mines...

482
00:30:44,667 --> 00:30:46,917
Yes, the inhalation
of coal dust.

483
00:30:48,917 --> 00:30:52,125
That's one form of the diseases,
called anthracosis.

484
00:30:54,125 --> 00:30:55,292
What are the others?

485
00:30:56,292 --> 00:30:58,208
Chalicosis...

486
00:30:58,333 --> 00:31:00,333
from metal dust.

487
00:31:00,375 --> 00:31:02,375
Steel works.

488
00:31:02,583 --> 00:31:04,583
Yes, of course, steel works.

489
00:31:05,583 --> 00:31:06,667
And silicosis.

490
00:31:08,625 --> 00:31:11,750
That's stone dust.
Gold mines.

491
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,875
I see.

492
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:19,000
- There's your train.
- Yes.

493
00:31:19,042 --> 00:31:21,167
- You mustn't miss it.
- No.

494
00:31:21,333 --> 00:31:24,333
- What's the matter?
- Nothing. Nothing at all really.

495
00:31:26,417 --> 00:31:28,500
It's been nice. I enjoyed the
afternoon enormously.

496
00:31:28,542 --> 00:31:31,708
So have I. Sorry for boring you
with medical words.

497
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:34,750
I feel stupid
not to understand more.

498
00:31:35,875 --> 00:31:37,833
Shall I see you again?

499
00:31:37,958 --> 00:31:39,875
You have to run.

500
00:31:39,958 --> 00:31:41,958
Mine's not due
for a few minutes.

501
00:31:42,042 --> 00:31:44,250
- Shall I see you again?
- Yes, of course.

502
00:31:45,083 --> 00:31:47,333
You could come to Ketchworth
one Sunday. We should be delighted.

503
00:31:48,167 --> 00:31:49,417
- Please... please.
- What is it?

504
00:31:50,292 --> 00:31:52,333
Next Thursday,
the same time.

505
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,542
- No, I couldn't possibly.
- Please.

506
00:31:55,708 --> 00:31:57,708
I ask you most humbly.

507
00:31:58,667 --> 00:31:59,833
You'll miss your train.

508
00:32:00,875 --> 00:32:01,958
All right.

509
00:32:02,917 --> 00:32:04,000
- Run.
- Goodbye.

510
00:32:04,042 --> 00:32:07,083
- I'll be there.
- Thank you.

511
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:39,375
I stood there and watched his train
draw out of the station.

512
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:42,458
I stared after it...

513
00:32:43,375 --> 00:32:45,583
until its tail light
had vanished into the darkness.

514
00:32:48,792 --> 00:32:50,875
I imagined him
getting out at Churley...

515
00:32:51,875 --> 00:32:56,000
giving up his ticket,
walking back through the streets...

516
00:32:57,042 --> 00:32:59,167
letting himself in his house
with his latchkey.

517
00:33:01,167 --> 00:33:03,375
His wife, Madeleine...

518
00:33:04,417 --> 00:33:06,500
would probably be
in the hall to meet him.

519
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:11,708
Or perhaps upstairs,
not feeling very well.

520
00:33:12,708 --> 00:33:15,667
"Small, dark
and rather delicate. "

521
00:33:16,833 --> 00:33:18,875
I wondered if he'd say:

522
00:33:19,042 --> 00:33:21,125
"I met such a nice woman
at the Kardomah...

523
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:24,125
We had lunch and
went to the pictures. "

524
00:33:27,125 --> 00:33:31,375
But suddenly I knew he wouldn't.
I knew he wouldn't say a word.

525
00:33:31,458 --> 00:33:34,667
Then the first awful feeling
of danger swept over me.

526
00:33:43,958 --> 00:33:47,167
I got in the first compartment I saw,
I wanted to get home quickly.

527
00:33:49,167 --> 00:33:52,250
I looked around to see if
anyone was looking at me.

528
00:33:53,208 --> 00:33:55,333
As if they could read
my thoughts.

529
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:58,583
No one was, except a clergyman.

530
00:33:59,542 --> 00:34:04,583
I felt myself blushing and opened
my book and pretended to read.

531
00:34:06,833 --> 00:34:10,042
When I got to Ketchworth, I'd decided
I wouldn't see Alec anymore.

532
00:34:10,917 --> 00:34:15,083
- Good evening Mrs. Jesson.
- It was silly, flirting with a stranger.

533
00:34:16,292 --> 00:34:17,375
Good evening.

534
00:34:18,208 --> 00:34:20,333
I walked home briskly
and cheerfully.

535
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:23,542
I'd been behaving like an idiot,
but no harm had been done.

536
00:34:26,625 --> 00:34:27,792
You met me in the hall.

537
00:34:28,667 --> 00:34:32,833
You looked worried. My heart sank.
Fred, what's the matter?

538
00:34:32,875 --> 00:34:35,000
It's all right, keep calm
and don't get upset.

539
00:34:35,083 --> 00:34:39,000
- What's wrong?
- Bobbie's been knocked down.

540
00:34:39,125 --> 00:34:41,250
It's not serious.
He was knocked against the curb...

541
00:34:41,333 --> 00:34:45,375
and he's got a slight concussion.
The doctor's with him now.

542
00:34:52,583 --> 00:34:54,708
It's all right.
Don't worry.

543
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:57,750
He'll be as right
as rain in a few hours.

544
00:34:58,875 --> 00:35:01,000
You're sure it's not serious?

545
00:35:01,083 --> 00:35:05,083
Quite sure.
It was a lucky escape.

546
00:35:05,167 --> 00:35:06,250
I've given him a sedative.

547
00:35:06,333 --> 00:35:09,333
Keep him at home
a couple of days.

548
00:35:09,417 --> 00:35:11,417
It must have been a shock...

549
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:14,667
I felt dreadful, looking at him
with that bandage on his head.

550
00:35:15,625 --> 00:35:18,625
I tried not to show it but
I was quite hysterical.

551
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:20,833
As if it were my fault...

552
00:35:20,917 --> 00:35:22,917
a sort of punishment...

553
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,083
an awful, sinister warning.

554
00:35:27,042 --> 00:35:30,083
An hour or two later,
everything was normal again.

555
00:35:30,167 --> 00:35:32,167
He began to enjoy
the whole thing...

556
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:34,417
and revelled in being
the centre of attraction.

557
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,458
Oh good.

558
00:35:37,375 --> 00:35:39,583
Remember how we spent the
evening planning his future?

559
00:35:41,583 --> 00:35:43,667
He's much too young to decide.

560
00:35:43,708 --> 00:35:45,708
Good life.
He's a feeling for it.

561
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:47,958
How can we know?

562
00:35:48,875 --> 00:35:50,917
He'll want to be an engine
driver next week.

563
00:35:50,958 --> 00:35:53,083
No, that was last week.

564
00:35:54,042 --> 00:35:57,208
It's so final, entering a child
for the Navy.

565
00:35:57,333 --> 00:36:01,375
- It's a healthy life.
- I know it's a good, healthy life...

566
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:04,458
He'll see the world, have
a wife in every port...

567
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,750
and call everybody " sir",
but what about us?

568
00:36:07,583 --> 00:36:08,667
What do you mean?

569
00:36:08,792 --> 00:36:10,917
- We'll hardly see him.
- Nonsense.

570
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:15,958
It isn't nonsense. He'll be
sent away a smooth-faced boy...

571
00:36:16,042 --> 00:36:19,167
and the next thing we know he'll
walk in with a beard and a parrot.

572
00:36:20,125 --> 00:36:23,167
You've rather a Victorian view
of the Navy.

573
00:36:23,375 --> 00:36:26,375
He's our only son and I'd like
to be there while he's growing up.

574
00:36:26,542 --> 00:36:31,583
We'll put him in an office and you
can put him on the 8:50 each morning.

575
00:36:32,583 --> 00:36:34,792
You are annoying.
You know I'd hate that.

576
00:36:34,875 --> 00:36:36,917
All right, have it your own way.

577
00:36:41,042 --> 00:36:42,042
Fred...

578
00:36:45,125 --> 00:36:47,208
I had lunch with a man
and we went to the movies.

579
00:36:47,292 --> 00:36:48,375
Good for you.

580
00:36:49,417 --> 00:36:51,500
He's awfully nice.
He's a doctor.

581
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:55,458
A very noble profession.

582
00:36:56,667 --> 00:36:57,750
Dear.

583
00:36:58,792 --> 00:37:01,917
It was Richard the Third who said:
"My kingdom for a horse", wasn't it?

584
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,833
Yes.

585
00:37:03,958 --> 00:37:06,958
I wish he hadn't.
It spoils everything.

586
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:10,250
We could ask him to dinner.

587
00:37:11,125 --> 00:37:12,208
By all means.

588
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:15,250
Who?

589
00:37:16,333 --> 00:37:18,500
Doctor Harvey. The one
I was telling you about.

590
00:37:19,417 --> 00:37:21,542
- Must it be dinner?
- You're never at home for lunch.

591
00:37:21,625 --> 00:37:22,708
Exactly.

592
00:37:24,708 --> 00:37:25,792
Oh Fred.

593
00:37:27,917 --> 00:37:29,917
Now what on earth's the matter?

594
00:37:31,083 --> 00:37:35,083
Nothing. It's only...
Oh Fred...

595
00:37:35,125 --> 00:37:37,208
I really don't see
what's so funny.

596
00:37:37,292 --> 00:37:41,292
I do... I'm not laughing at you,
I'm laughing at me.

597
00:37:42,375 --> 00:37:44,458
I'm the funny one.
I'm an absolute idiot.

598
00:37:44,542 --> 00:37:46,750
Worrying about things
that don't exist...

599
00:37:47,583 --> 00:37:49,667
and making mountains
out of molehills.

600
00:37:49,792 --> 00:37:51,917
I told you it was
nothing serious.

601
00:37:52,792 --> 00:37:56,000
- Nothing to get in a state about.
- I see that now. I really do.

602
00:38:06,333 --> 00:38:08,458
On Thursday
I went to meet Alec...

603
00:38:08,542 --> 00:38:11,583
more out of politeness
than anything else.

604
00:38:11,625 --> 00:38:14,750
It didn't seem important
but I had promised.

605
00:38:16,792 --> 00:38:18,792
I managed to get
the same table.

606
00:38:18,917 --> 00:38:21,958
I waited a bit
but he didn't come.

607
00:38:23,042 --> 00:38:25,250
The orchestra
was playing as usual.

608
00:38:26,125 --> 00:38:29,333
I looked at the cellist.
She seemed so funny last week.

609
00:38:29,375 --> 00:38:31,500
Today she didn't seem funny.

610
00:38:32,417 --> 00:38:34,458
She looked pathetic.

611
00:38:35,583 --> 00:38:38,750
After lunch,
I passed the hospital.

612
00:38:39,875 --> 00:38:42,875
I looked up at the windows
and wondered if he were there...

613
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
or if something awful
had happened.

614
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,250
I got to the station early.
I hadn't enjoyed the pictures.

615
00:38:50,333 --> 00:38:53,417
It was a noisy musical
and I'm so sick of them.

616
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:55,458
I'd come out before the end.

617
00:38:56,333 --> 00:38:58,375
As I took my tea to the table...

618
00:38:58,417 --> 00:39:00,458
I suddenly wondered if I'd
made a mistake...

619
00:39:00,542 --> 00:39:02,625
if he meant me
to meet him there.

620
00:39:18,292 --> 00:39:19,375
Albert Godby, how dare you!

621
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:22,500
- I couldn't resist.
- Keep your hands to yourself.

622
00:39:22,583 --> 00:39:25,542
You're blushing. You're
wonderful when you're angry.

623
00:39:25,583 --> 00:39:28,625
- An avenging angel.
- I'll give you avenging angel.

624
00:39:28,708 --> 00:39:29,792
Coming here, taking liberties.

625
00:39:29,917 --> 00:39:33,000
I thought after last Monday
you wouldn't mind.

626
00:39:33,042 --> 00:39:36,875
Never mind last Monday.
I'm on duty now.

627
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:39,167
What if Mr Saunders was
looking through the window.

628
00:39:40,042 --> 00:39:43,208
If he's in the habit, it's about time
he saw something worth looking at.

629
00:39:43,292 --> 00:39:47,417
- You ought to be ashamed!
- It's high spirits. Don't be mad.

630
00:39:47,458 --> 00:39:50,458
Indeed.
Take your tea and be quiet.

631
00:39:50,583 --> 00:39:53,708
- It's all your fault, really.
- I don't know what you mean.

632
00:39:54,667 --> 00:39:55,917
I was thinking of tonight.

633
00:39:56,750 --> 00:40:00,083
If you don't behave yourself there
won't be tonight or any night.

634
00:40:00,917 --> 00:40:03,125
- Give us a kiss.
- I'll do no such thing.

635
00:40:03,208 --> 00:40:05,208
- Come on, a quick one across the bar.
- Albert, stop it!

636
00:40:05,292 --> 00:40:07,333
- Come on.
- Let go!

637
00:40:07,375 --> 00:40:08,375
- Come on, love.
- Albert.

638
00:40:09,208 --> 00:40:11,292
Now look at my Banburys,
all over the floor.

639
00:40:12,583 --> 00:40:15,500
Just in time
or born in the vestry.

640
00:40:15,542 --> 00:40:18,625
You shut your mouth and help
Mr Godby pick up them cakes.

641
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,875
Come on, what are you
gaping at?

642
00:40:41,625 --> 00:40:44,667
As I left the Refreshment Room
I saw a train coming in.

643
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:47,833
His train.
He wasn't on the platform.

644
00:40:47,958 --> 00:40:51,042
And I suddenly felt panic at the
thought of not seeing him again.

645
00:40:58,417 --> 00:41:01,375
I'm so terribly sorry.
I couldn't let you know.

646
00:41:01,458 --> 00:41:04,625
- Your train, you'll miss it.
- The house surgeon had to operate.

647
00:41:11,875 --> 00:41:14,917
I was going to send a note but I
thought it might embarrass you.

648
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,958
Don't say any more.

649
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:24,417
Quickly! Quickly!
The whistle's gone.

650
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:30,708
I'm so glad I'd chance to explain.
I didn't think I'd see you again.

651
00:41:31,542 --> 00:41:32,708
How absurd.
Quickly! Quickly!

652
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:36,917
- Next Thursday.
- Yes. Next Thursday.

653
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:38,875
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

654
00:41:38,917 --> 00:41:41,083
Thursday! Goodbye!

655
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:47,333
The train for Ketchworth is about
to leave from Platform 3.

656
00:41:58,708 --> 00:42:00,708
The stars can change courses...

657
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:02,917
and the world
crash around us...

658
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,833
but there'll always be
Donald Duck.

659
00:42:04,917 --> 00:42:08,208
I do love him, his energy,
his blind frustrated rages.

660
00:42:10,083 --> 00:42:14,208
It's the big picture now. Here we go.
No more laughter, prepare for tears.

661
00:42:18,458 --> 00:42:19,625
It was a terribly bad picture.

662
00:42:20,625 --> 00:42:23,750
We crept out before the end,
rather furtively...

663
00:42:23,792 --> 00:42:25,875
as though we were
committing a crime.

664
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:29,042
The usherette looked at us
with stoney contempt.

665
00:42:30,917 --> 00:42:34,083
It was a lovely afternoon and it was
a relief to be in the fresh air.

666
00:42:34,167 --> 00:42:36,292
We decided to go
to the botanical gardens.

667
00:42:37,167 --> 00:42:39,458
I believe that
we'd all behave differently...

668
00:42:40,292 --> 00:42:42,375
if we lived
in a sunny climate.

669
00:42:42,542 --> 00:42:45,542
Not so withdrawn and shy
and difficult.

670
00:42:46,667 --> 00:42:48,750
Fred, it was a lovely afternoon.

671
00:42:48,833 --> 00:42:52,875
Some boys were sailing boats.
One looked like Bobbie.

672
00:42:52,917 --> 00:42:55,958
It should've given me a pang
of conscience, but it didn't.

673
00:42:56,042 --> 00:42:58,000
I was enjoying myself...

674
00:42:58,083 --> 00:43:00,125
enjoying every single minute.

675
00:43:00,167 --> 00:43:04,208
Alec said he was sick of staring at
the water and he wanted to be on it.

676
00:43:05,417 --> 00:43:09,500
All the boats were covered up
but we persuaded the man.

677
00:43:10,542 --> 00:43:12,583
He thought we were raving mad.

678
00:43:13,625 --> 00:43:14,792
Perhaps he was right.

679
00:43:14,917 --> 00:43:18,958
Alec rowed and I trailed
my hand in the water.

680
00:43:19,042 --> 00:43:21,958
It was cold
but a lovely feeling.

681
00:43:27,375 --> 00:43:29,458
You don't row very well,
do you?

682
00:43:30,333 --> 00:43:32,542
I'll be perfectly honest with you.
I don't row at all.

683
00:43:33,417 --> 00:43:35,583
Unless you want to go
round in circles...

684
00:43:35,625 --> 00:43:37,708
you'd better steer.

685
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:41,750
We had such fun.

686
00:43:41,875 --> 00:43:44,833
I felt gay and happy
and released.

687
00:43:45,083 --> 00:43:47,167
That's what's so shameful.

688
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:50,250
That's what would hurt you
so much if you knew...

689
00:43:51,208 --> 00:43:53,333
that I could feel so intensely...

690
00:43:53,417 --> 00:43:55,417
away from you...

691
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:57,458
with a stranger.

692
00:43:59,458 --> 00:44:01,542
Look out.
We can't get through.

693
00:44:01,583 --> 00:44:02,667
Pull on your left.

694
00:44:08,917 --> 00:44:11,000
I never could tell
left from right.

695
00:44:11,042 --> 00:44:13,042
I'm most awfully sorry.

696
00:44:36,125 --> 00:44:39,042
The British are always
nice to mad people.

697
00:44:39,167 --> 00:44:42,292
The boatman thinks we're dotty,
but look how sweet he's been.

698
00:44:43,292 --> 00:44:46,333
Tea, milk, even sugar.

699
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:53,625
Thank you.

700
00:45:07,167 --> 00:45:08,333
You know what's happened,
don't you?

701
00:45:11,458 --> 00:45:12,542
Yes.

702
00:45:13,583 --> 00:45:15,458
Yes, I do.

703
00:45:16,583 --> 00:45:18,708
I've fallen in love with you.

704
00:45:20,875 --> 00:45:21,958
Yes, I know.

705
00:45:26,125 --> 00:45:30,042
Tell me honestly. Please, tell me
honestly, if what I believe is true.

706
00:45:32,208 --> 00:45:34,333
- What do you believe?
- That it's the same for you.

707
00:45:35,292 --> 00:45:36,458
That you've fallen in love, too.

708
00:45:39,458 --> 00:45:40,625
- It sounds so silly.
- Why?

709
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:43,750
- I know you so little.
- It is true, though, isn't it?

710
00:45:46,792 --> 00:45:47,958
- It's true.
- Laura...

711
00:45:48,792 --> 00:45:51,917
No, please.
We must be sensible.

712
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,083
We mustn't behave like this.

713
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:55,208
We must forget what we've said.

714
00:45:55,292 --> 00:45:58,292
- Not yet.
- But we must.

715
00:46:00,417 --> 00:46:01,500
Listen.

716
00:46:02,417 --> 00:46:04,625
It's too late
to be sensible...

717
00:46:05,583 --> 00:46:07,583
Too late to forget what we said.

718
00:46:07,667 --> 00:46:09,708
Whether we said it or not
doesn't matter.

719
00:46:10,750 --> 00:46:12,958
We know. We've known
for a long time.

720
00:46:14,042 --> 00:46:18,125
How can you say that?
I've only known you 4 weeks.

721
00:46:19,083 --> 00:46:21,292
We only talked for the first time
last Thursday week.

722
00:46:22,167 --> 00:46:26,417
Last Thursday week.
Has it been a long time since then?

723
00:46:26,458 --> 00:46:28,458
Answer me truly.

724
00:46:28,625 --> 00:46:30,458
Yes.

725
00:46:30,542 --> 00:46:32,667
How often did you decide you were
never going to see me again?

726
00:46:33,833 --> 00:46:35,917
- Several times a day.
- So did I.

727
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:37,917
- Oh Alec.
- I love you.

728
00:46:38,792 --> 00:46:39,958
I love your wide eyes...

729
00:46:40,958 --> 00:46:42,125
and the way you smile...

730
00:46:43,083 --> 00:46:44,250
and your shyness...

731
00:46:45,250 --> 00:46:47,292
- the way you laugh at my jokes.
- Please don't.

732
00:46:47,333 --> 00:46:49,417
I love you. I love you.

733
00:46:50,417 --> 00:46:53,458
You love me too. We can't pretend
it hasn't happened. It has.

734
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:55,667
Yes, it has.

735
00:46:56,542 --> 00:46:58,750
I don't want to pretend
to you or anyone.

736
00:46:59,708 --> 00:47:00,875
But from now I have to.

737
00:47:01,750 --> 00:47:04,875
That's what's wrong, you see.
It spoils everything.

738
00:47:04,958 --> 00:47:07,083
That's why we must stop here
and now talking like this.

739
00:47:08,208 --> 00:47:11,208
Neither of us are free to love,
there's too much in the way.

740
00:47:13,208 --> 00:47:15,292
There's still time.

741
00:47:15,375 --> 00:47:18,583
If we control ourselves and behave
like sensible human beings...

742
00:47:20,542 --> 00:47:22,542
there's still time.

743
00:47:24,792 --> 00:47:26,833
There's no time at all.

744
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,083
- There's your train.
- Yes.

745
00:47:33,208 --> 00:47:36,125
I'll come to the platform
with you.

746
00:47:56,958 --> 00:47:59,083
No, Alec, not here.
Someone will see.

747
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:01,208
I love you so.

748
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:15,833
Could we turn that
down a bit, darling?

749
00:48:16,958 --> 00:48:18,875
Laura!

750
00:48:20,958 --> 00:48:24,167
- Yes, dear?
- You were miles away.

751
00:48:25,250 --> 00:48:27,208
Was I?

752
00:48:27,250 --> 00:48:30,292
Why not turn it down?
It really is deafening.

753
00:48:30,375 --> 00:48:31,458
Of course.

754
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:43,792
I shan't be long.
Then we'll go to bed.

755
00:48:43,958 --> 00:48:45,917
You look a bit tired.

756
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Don't hurry.
I'm perfectly happy.

757
00:48:56,542 --> 00:49:01,583
How can I say that,
"Don't hurry. I'm perfectly happy"?

758
00:49:03,625 --> 00:49:04,708
If only it were true!

759
00:49:05,792 --> 00:49:08,833
Not that anyone is
ever perfectly happy really...

760
00:49:09,042 --> 00:49:12,958
but to be contented,
to be at peace.

761
00:49:14,250 --> 00:49:19,292
It's a little while ago but it seems
like ages since that train left.

762
00:49:20,417 --> 00:49:22,542
Taking him away
into the darkness.

763
00:49:23,542 --> 00:49:25,458
I was happy then.

764
00:49:25,625 --> 00:49:29,625
As I went back through the subway,
I was walking on air.

765
00:49:30,667 --> 00:49:33,917
When I got into the train. I didn't
even pretend to read.

766
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,083
I didn't care if people were looking.
I had to think.

767
00:49:38,083 --> 00:49:41,250
I should've been wretched and
ashamed. But I wasn't.

768
00:49:42,167 --> 00:49:44,333
I felt suddenly wildly happy...

769
00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:48,417
like a romantic schoolgirl,
like a romantic fool.

770
00:49:49,458 --> 00:49:52,583
He said he loved me...

771
00:49:52,750 --> 00:49:57,750
and I said I loved him.
And it was true. It was true.

772
00:49:58,917 --> 00:50:01,125
I imagined being in his arms...

773
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,125
being with him in glamourous
circumstances.

774
00:50:05,167 --> 00:50:11,333
It was an absurd schoolgirl fantasy,
being wooed by one's dream man.

775
00:50:16,667 --> 00:50:19,708
I stared out of the window
into the dark...

776
00:50:19,875 --> 00:50:23,792
and watched the dim trees and
telegraph posts slip by...

777
00:50:24,042 --> 00:50:26,083
and through them
I saw Alec and me.

778
00:50:29,083 --> 00:50:31,083
Alec and me.

779
00:50:31,208 --> 00:50:34,333
Perhaps a little younger,
but just as much in love.

780
00:50:34,417 --> 00:50:36,458
And with nothing in the way.

781
00:50:41,625 --> 00:50:44,708
I saw us in Paris,
in a box at the opera.

782
00:50:45,667 --> 00:50:46,917
The orchestra was tuning up.

783
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:58,333
Then we were in Venice, in a gondola,
with sound of mandolins.

784
00:50:59,375 --> 00:51:04,500
I saw us travelling far away. All
the places I've always longed to go.

785
00:51:06,708 --> 00:51:10,750
I saw us on a ship looking
at the sea and the stars...

786
00:51:12,875 --> 00:51:17,042
standing on a tropical beach in the
moonlight, with palm tress sighing.

787
00:51:19,042 --> 00:51:23,375
Then the palm trees changed into
those willows by the canal.

788
00:51:24,458 --> 00:51:27,375
All the silly dreams disappeared.

789
00:51:27,583 --> 00:51:31,500
I got out at Ketchworth
and gave up my ticket...

790
00:51:31,708 --> 00:51:37,875
and walked home as usual, soberly,
and without any wings at all.

791
00:51:38,917 --> 00:51:42,000
When I was getting ready for dinner,
do you remember?

792
00:51:42,042 --> 00:51:44,042
You won't but I do.

793
00:51:45,083 --> 00:51:48,375
That was the first time I'd ever
lied to you.

794
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:56,500
It started then, the shame of the
whole thing, the guilt, the fear.

795
00:51:57,667 --> 00:52:00,708
- Good evening Mrs. Jesson.
- Hello, dear.

796
00:52:01,833 --> 00:52:03,875
- Had a good day?
- Yes, lovely.

797
00:52:05,083 --> 00:52:06,958
What did you do?

798
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,208
I shopped and had lunch and
went to the pictures.

799
00:52:09,250 --> 00:52:11,292
- All by yourself?
- Yes...

800
00:52:12,208 --> 00:52:15,417
- No, not exactly.
- What do you mean, not exactly.

801
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:20,583
I went to the pictures by myself but
I had lunch with Mary Norton.

802
00:52:20,667 --> 00:52:24,875
She couldn't come to the film. She had
to see her in-laws just near Milford.

803
00:52:25,833 --> 00:52:28,792
I walked her to the bus and came
home on my own.

804
00:52:28,875 --> 00:52:31,000
I haven't seen Mary Norton
for ages. How's she looking?

805
00:52:31,125 --> 00:52:33,208
Very well. A little fatter.

806
00:52:34,042 --> 00:52:36,250
Hurry up with all this beautifying.
I want my dinner.

807
00:52:37,167 --> 00:52:39,250
You go down.
I won't be five minutes.

808
00:53:02,292 --> 00:53:04,417
Ketchworth 37, please.

809
00:53:13,708 --> 00:53:17,833
Hello. Is Mrs. Norton there, please?
Yes. I'll hold on.

810
00:53:20,042 --> 00:53:22,167
- Hello.
- Hello is that you. Mary?

811
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:26,208
Laura! Fancy hearing from you.
I thought you were dead.

812
00:53:27,250 --> 00:53:29,292
No, I haven't seen
you for ages.

813
00:53:29,375 --> 00:53:34,417
Will you be a saint and back me up
in the most appalling domestic lie?

814
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:37,625
- As bad as all that?
- My life depends on it.

815
00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:40,833
Today I went to Milford
to do my shopping...

816
00:53:41,792 --> 00:53:44,958
with the intention of buying an
expensive present for Fred.

817
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,083
Robson's hadn't got
what I wanted...

818
00:53:48,125 --> 00:53:51,292
one of those clocks with barometers
and everything in one.

819
00:53:51,333 --> 00:53:56,458
But they had one at the Broadham
branch so I went to get it.

820
00:53:57,375 --> 00:54:00,708
- Go on.
- This is were the black lie comes in.

821
00:54:01,750 --> 00:54:06,875
Fred asked me about my day and
I said you and I had lunch together..

822
00:54:06,958 --> 00:54:10,000
then you'd gone to your in-laws'
and I'd gone to the pictures.

823
00:54:10,042 --> 00:54:12,042
If you run into him, don't let me
down, will you?

824
00:54:12,125 --> 00:54:16,208
- But darling, of course not.
- I'll do as much for you I promise.

825
00:54:16,292 --> 00:54:19,458
- Well let's really lunch one day.
- Yes, that'd be lovely.

826
00:54:20,292 --> 00:54:24,542
- What about next Thursday?
- No I can't. That's my Milford day.

827
00:54:24,583 --> 00:54:27,667
- What about Friday?
- Fine better make it here.

828
00:54:27,750 --> 00:54:30,917
- All right, perfect.
- You know what my cook's like?

829
00:54:31,792 --> 00:54:34,958
- It'll have to be early.
- Yes, all right.

830
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,917
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

831
00:54:51,542 --> 00:54:52,625
That week was misery.

832
00:54:54,792 --> 00:54:57,792
I was in a sort of trance.

833
00:54:59,875 --> 00:55:03,125
How odd you didn't notice you were
living with a stranger in the house.

834
00:55:06,208 --> 00:55:08,208
Thursday came at last.

835
00:55:08,375 --> 00:55:11,417
I'd arranged to meet Alec
outside the hospital at 12:30.

836
00:55:18,792 --> 00:55:20,792
- Hello.
- Hello.

837
00:55:20,917 --> 00:55:24,917
I thought you wouldn't come. I've
been thinking all week you wouldn't.

838
00:55:25,917 --> 00:55:28,125
I didn't mean to really,
but here I am.

839
00:55:34,375 --> 00:55:37,417
I hadn't been in the Royal since
Violet's wedding reception.

840
00:55:37,542 --> 00:55:39,542
It all seemed very grand.

841
00:55:39,667 --> 00:55:44,792
He ordered a bottle of champagne and
said we were only middle-aged once!

842
00:55:44,875 --> 00:55:47,958
We were very gay during lunch and
talked about quite ordinary things.

843
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:52,125
He was charming. You'd have liked
him if things had been different.

844
00:55:53,167 --> 00:55:55,292
As we were going out he said
he had a surprise for me...

845
00:55:56,125 --> 00:55:59,250
and that if I'd wait in the lounge
he'd show me what it was.

846
00:55:59,375 --> 00:56:04,500
He ran down the steps like an excited
schoolboy, not a respectable doctor.

847
00:56:06,625 --> 00:56:09,833
Suddenly out of the dining room came
Mary Norton and her rich cousin.

848
00:56:10,833 --> 00:56:14,875
They must've seen Alec and me,
the champagne and everything.

849
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,167
Laura! It was you after all.

850
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:20,042
Hermione said it was...

851
00:56:20,125 --> 00:56:23,375
I'm so short-sighted.
I peered but couldn't be sure.

852
00:56:23,417 --> 00:56:26,500
I never saw you at all. How awful.
I expect it was the champagne.

853
00:56:27,375 --> 00:56:30,500
I'm not used to champagne for
lunch or dinner...

854
00:56:30,583 --> 00:56:33,625
- but Alec insisted.
- Alec? Alec who, dear?

855
00:56:33,708 --> 00:56:36,958
Alec Harvey, of course. You remember
the Harveys. I've known them years.

856
00:56:37,792 --> 00:56:40,000
- No I don't think...
- He'll be back.

857
00:56:40,083 --> 00:56:42,125
You'll recognise him
when you peer closely.

858
00:56:42,167 --> 00:56:46,083
- He looks charming, very attentive.
- He's a dear.

859
00:56:46,167 --> 00:56:48,292
One of the nicest people in the world
and a wonderful doctor.

860
00:56:51,417 --> 00:56:54,625
- Alec, do you remember Mrs. Norton?
- I'm afraid I don't.

861
00:56:54,667 --> 00:56:59,667
It's no use Laura. We've never seen
each other before. I'm sure.

862
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:03,917
How absurd. I'm sure he and Madeleine
were at that dinner before Christmas.

863
00:57:04,875 --> 00:57:07,000
- Alec, this is Mrs. Rolandson.
- How do you do?

864
00:57:07,125 --> 00:57:09,042
- Horrid weather, isn't it?
- Yes.

865
00:57:09,125 --> 00:57:12,167
Of course, one can't expect spring
at this time of the year.

866
00:57:15,417 --> 00:57:20,458
We must be going. I'm taking Harmione
to see the in-laws, as moral support.

867
00:57:20,583 --> 00:57:21,667
- Goodbye, Doctor Harvey.
- Goodbye.

868
00:57:22,542 --> 00:57:25,750
Goodbye, my dear.
I do envy you your champagne.

869
00:57:25,917 --> 00:57:27,875
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

870
00:57:33,125 --> 00:57:35,208
- That was awful.
- Never mind.

871
00:57:35,250 --> 00:57:37,375
They'd watched us
all through lunch.

872
00:57:38,250 --> 00:57:40,500
Forget it. Come out
and look at the surprise.

873
00:57:42,333 --> 00:57:44,542
At the foot of the steps
was a litle two-seater car.

874
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:47,708
Alec had borrowed it from
Stephen Lynn for the afternoon.

875
00:57:48,667 --> 00:57:51,708
I tried hard to look pleased
but it wasn't any good.

876
00:57:51,875 --> 00:57:55,000
I kept thinking of those
two laughing and talking...

877
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,083
Laughing and talking. I couldn't
get them out of my mind.

878
00:58:00,292 --> 00:58:04,292
When we were out in the country,
a few miles beyond Brayfield...

879
00:58:04,458 --> 00:58:07,417
we stopped the car outside
a village and got out.

880
00:58:07,583 --> 00:58:09,625
There was a bridge and a stream.

881
00:58:10,542 --> 00:58:13,708
The sun was making an effort to come
out but not succeeding.

882
00:58:14,708 --> 00:58:17,875
We leaned on the parapet
and looked down into the water.

883
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,875
I shivered and Alec put
his asm around me.

884
00:58:21,042 --> 00:58:23,167
- Cold?
- No, not really.

885
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:25,125
Happy?

886
00:58:28,333 --> 00:58:30,292
No, not really.

887
00:58:31,458 --> 00:58:33,583
I know exactly what
you're going to say.

888
00:58:34,583 --> 00:58:36,542
That it isn't worth it...

889
00:58:37,583 --> 00:58:41,833
the lying outweighs the happiness
we might have together.

890
00:58:41,958 --> 00:58:43,833
Isn't that it?

891
00:58:44,917 --> 00:58:46,083
Something like that.

892
00:58:50,167 --> 00:58:53,292
I want to ask you something,
just to reassure myself.

893
00:58:53,375 --> 00:58:55,250
What?

894
00:58:56,375 --> 00:58:58,375
It is true for you isn't it?

895
00:58:58,542 --> 00:59:02,667
This overwhelming feeling.
Is a true for you as it is for me?

896
00:59:04,625 --> 00:59:05,708
It's true.

897
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,167
We must have stayed on
that bridge for a long time...

898
00:59:16,250 --> 00:59:19,375
because when we got back to
Stephen Lynn's it was getting dark.

899
00:59:21,417 --> 00:59:24,417
I felt as if I was
on the edge of a precipice.

900
00:59:24,583 --> 00:59:26,583
I think Alec felt that, too.

901
00:59:26,708 --> 00:59:29,750
We both knew how desperately
we loved each other.

902
00:59:32,875 --> 00:59:35,958
Alec had to leave the keys
in Stephen Lynn's flat...

903
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
and suggested
I came up with him.

904
00:59:38,125 --> 00:59:40,167
I refused rather too vehemently.

905
00:59:40,250 --> 00:59:44,292
Alec reminded me that Stephen wasn't
coming back till late, but I refused.

906
00:59:54,708 --> 00:59:56,917
I'm going back. I'm going
to miss my train.

907
00:59:57,958 --> 01:00:00,000
- Back where?
- To Stephen's flat.

908
01:00:01,042 --> 01:00:02,125
Oh Alec.

909
01:00:17,583 --> 01:00:20,792
I must go home,
I really must go.

910
01:00:42,625 --> 01:00:43,792
A cup of tea please.

911
01:00:53,167 --> 01:00:56,125
- Good afternoon.
- Afternoon lady.

912
01:00:56,167 --> 01:00:58,375
- Couple of whiskies please.
- Very sorry. It's out of hours.

913
01:00:59,208 --> 01:01:01,500
Sneak us a couple
under them old sandwiches.

914
01:01:02,375 --> 01:01:04,583
Them sandwiches are fresh
and I'll do no such thing.

915
01:01:04,625 --> 01:01:06,542
Come on, be a sport.

916
01:01:06,625 --> 01:01:08,750
You can have as much as
you want after 6 o'clock.

917
01:01:08,792 --> 01:01:11,750
My throat's like
a parrot cage. Listen.

918
01:01:12,875 --> 01:01:17,083
My license doesn't permit me to serve
alcohol out of hours. That's final!

919
01:01:17,125 --> 01:01:19,125
You wouldn't want to get me
into trouble, would you?

920
01:01:19,167 --> 01:01:23,167
Just give us the chance.
That's all we ask.

921
01:01:25,458 --> 01:01:26,458
Beryl!

922
01:01:28,375 --> 01:01:31,625
Ask Mr. Godby to come
for a moment will you?

923
01:01:31,708 --> 01:01:33,833
- Who's he when he's at home?
- You'll soon see...

924
01:01:34,667 --> 01:01:36,917
- Come in here, cheeking me...
- Come of it, mother, be a pal.

925
01:01:36,958 --> 01:01:39,000
You saucy upstart.

926
01:01:39,042 --> 01:01:43,208
- Who are you calling an upstart?
- You. Get out of here double quick...

927
01:01:44,042 --> 01:01:46,167
disturbing the customers
and making a nuisance of yourselves.

928
01:01:46,250 --> 01:01:49,333
- Where's the fire? Where's the fire?
- What's going on in here?

929
01:01:49,417 --> 01:01:51,500
Mr. Godby, these gentlemen
are annoying me.

930
01:01:52,333 --> 01:01:55,625
- We haven't done nothing, have we?
- Just asked for a couple of drinks.

931
01:01:56,583 --> 01:01:59,792
- They insulted me, Mr. Godby.
- We never did anything of the kind.

932
01:02:00,667 --> 01:02:02,750
- Just having a little joke.
- Hop it. Both of you.

933
01:02:02,833 --> 01:02:05,958
- We've got a right to stay here.
- You heard what I said. Hop it.

934
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Is this a free country
or a Sunday school?

935
01:02:09,042 --> 01:02:12,208
I checked your warrant. Your train's
in 1 minute, platform 2. Hop it!

936
01:02:12,292 --> 01:02:15,292
- Now, look here.
- Come on Johnnie.

937
01:02:15,333 --> 01:02:18,500
- Don't argue with the poor basket.
- Hop it.

938
01:02:23,625 --> 01:02:24,708
Cheerio Mother.

939
01:02:25,917 --> 01:02:29,000
And if them sandwiches are fresh,
you're Shirley Temple.

940
01:02:32,083 --> 01:02:35,208
- Thank you, Albert.
- What a nerve, talking like that.

941
01:02:35,250 --> 01:02:39,333
Be quiet, Beryl. Poor me out a nip
of three star. I'm quite upset.

942
01:02:39,375 --> 01:02:43,458
- I'll get back to the gate.
- I'll be seeing you later, Albert.

943
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:44,583
Okay!

944
01:02:50,750 --> 01:02:56,125
The train now arriving at Platform 3
is the 5:43 for Ketchworth.

945
01:03:00,250 --> 01:03:03,375
- I really must go.
- I'm going back to the flat.

946
01:03:04,292 --> 01:03:06,500
I must go home.
I really must go home.

947
01:03:06,542 --> 01:03:08,583
I'm going back to the flat.

948
01:03:11,667 --> 01:03:13,583
I'm going home.

949
01:03:36,750 --> 01:03:38,708
Excuse me,
I've forgotten something.

950
01:04:44,458 --> 01:04:46,333
Darling!

951
01:04:52,792 --> 01:04:54,708
It's raining.

952
01:04:55,792 --> 01:04:57,917
It started just as I turned
out of High street.

953
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,917
You had no umbrella
and your coat's wet.

954
01:05:01,042 --> 01:05:03,167
You mustn't catch cold.
That would never do.

955
01:05:07,375 --> 01:05:09,375
I look an absolute fright.

956
01:05:09,458 --> 01:05:12,375
- Let me put that down.
- Thank you.

957
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:17,667
I hope the fire will perk up.

958
01:05:18,750 --> 01:05:22,750
- I expect the wood was damp.
- Yes, I expect it was.

959
01:05:25,042 --> 01:05:26,958
Do sit down, darling.

960
01:05:33,375 --> 01:05:36,375
I got into the train and got out
again. Wasn't it idiotic?

961
01:05:36,542 --> 01:05:38,583
We're both very foolish.

962
01:05:44,750 --> 01:05:49,000
- Alec, I can't stay. Really.
- Just a little while, a little while.

963
01:05:52,167 --> 01:05:54,042
Quickly. Quickly. I must go.

964
01:05:54,125 --> 01:05:57,250
Here, through the kitchen.
There's a tradesman's staircase.

965
01:06:07,625 --> 01:06:09,750
- Is that you, Alec?
- Yes.

966
01:06:13,958 --> 01:06:16,042
- You're back early.
- Yes, I felt a cold coming on...

967
01:06:16,083 --> 01:06:18,125
so I denied myself
the pleasure...

968
01:06:18,167 --> 01:06:22,167
of dining with Roger Hinchly and
decided to come back.

969
01:06:22,375 --> 01:06:25,292
Inflamed membranes are
unsympathetic to a dialectic...

970
01:06:25,458 --> 01:06:29,667
- What will you do about food?
- I can ring down to the restaurant.

971
01:06:30,583 --> 01:06:32,708
We live in a modern age
and this is a service flat.

972
01:06:32,792 --> 01:06:36,917
- Yes, of course.
- It caters for all tastes.

973
01:06:43,125 --> 01:06:46,167
You've hidden depths
I never suspected.

974
01:06:46,208 --> 01:06:49,375
- Look here, Stephen, I...
- No explanations or apologies.

975
01:06:50,250 --> 01:06:53,417
I should apologise for
returning so inopportunely.

976
01:06:53,542 --> 01:06:56,667
It's quite obvious you were
interviewing a patient privately.

977
01:06:57,542 --> 01:07:01,792
Woman are frequently rather neurotic
creatures. Hospitals upset them.

978
01:07:01,917 --> 01:07:06,042
From the undignified
scuffling I heard...

979
01:07:06,125 --> 01:07:09,208
I gather she beat a hasty retreat
down the backstairs.

980
01:07:09,250 --> 01:07:13,250
I'm surprised at the farcical streak
in your nature, Alec.

981
01:07:13,292 --> 01:07:17,375
Such carryings on are unnecessary.
We've been friends for years...

982
01:07:17,458 --> 01:07:19,542
and I'm the most
broad-minded of men.

983
01:07:19,625 --> 01:07:25,792
I'm really sorry. I'm sure that the
situation must seem vulgar to you.

984
01:07:25,917 --> 01:07:27,917
Actually it isn't in the least.

985
01:07:28,792 --> 01:07:32,083
You're right. Explanations are
unnecessary between old friends.

986
01:07:33,042 --> 01:07:35,083
I must go now.
I'll collect my coat. Goodbye.

987
01:07:35,167 --> 01:07:40,458
Could you give me my latchkey? I only
have 2 and I'm afraid of losing them.

988
01:07:43,542 --> 01:07:47,667
- You're very angry, aren't you?
- No. Not angry. Just disappointed.

989
01:08:13,625 --> 01:08:15,750
I ran until I couldn't any longer.

990
01:08:15,833 --> 01:08:20,875
I leant against a lamp post
to get my breath in a side road...

991
01:08:20,958 --> 01:08:24,083
I knew it was stupid to run
but I couldn't help myself.

992
01:08:25,083 --> 01:08:29,375
I felt humiliated and defeated
and so dreadfully ashamed.

993
01:08:31,542 --> 01:08:34,500
After a moment or two
I pulled myself together...

994
01:08:35,625 --> 01:08:37,750
and walked towards the station.

995
01:08:38,667 --> 01:08:40,792
It was still raining
but not very much.

996
01:08:40,917 --> 01:08:43,833
I realised that I couldn't go home.

997
01:08:43,875 --> 01:08:47,083
Not until I regained control
and had time to think.

998
01:08:47,125 --> 01:08:50,042
Then I thought of you waiting
and dinner being spoilt.

999
01:08:50,125 --> 01:08:53,375
So I went found a tobacconist
and telephoned you.

1000
01:08:55,333 --> 01:08:56,500
Do you remember?

1001
01:09:21,292 --> 01:09:24,500
Hello Fred, is that you?
Yes. It's me, Laura.

1002
01:09:25,625 --> 01:09:28,708
Yes, everything's all right,
but I shan't be home to dinner.

1003
01:09:29,708 --> 01:09:30,875
I'm with Miss Lewis.

1004
01:09:31,750 --> 01:09:34,917
Miss Lewis, the librarian
I've told you about at Boots.

1005
01:09:35,917 --> 01:09:39,167
I can't explain because
she's outside the box now.

1006
01:09:40,125 --> 01:09:43,375
I met her a little while
ago in a terrible state.

1007
01:09:44,292 --> 01:09:47,542
Her mother's ill and I've promised
to stay until the doctor comes.

1008
01:09:49,542 --> 01:09:53,625
Yes, but she's always been kind
to me and I feel so sorry for her.

1009
01:09:54,667 --> 01:09:56,917
No, I'll get a sandwich.
Ask Ethel to leave me some soup...

1010
01:09:56,958 --> 01:09:58,958
in a saucepan in the kitchen.

1011
01:10:00,917 --> 01:10:02,167
Yes, of course,
as soon as I can.

1012
01:10:04,083 --> 01:10:05,250
All right. Goodbye.

1013
01:10:07,167 --> 01:10:10,375
It's awfully easy to lie, when you
know you are trusted implicitly.

1014
01:10:10,500 --> 01:10:14,417
So very easy,
and so very degrading.

1015
01:10:14,667 --> 01:10:17,542
I started walking without purpose.

1016
01:10:17,625 --> 01:10:19,750
I turned out of the High street
almost immediately.

1017
01:10:20,708 --> 01:10:22,792
I was terrified that
I might run into Alec.

1018
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:26,042
I was sure he'd come after me.

1019
01:10:27,167 --> 01:10:31,208
I walked for a long while. Finally, I
found myself at the war memorial.

1020
01:10:31,250 --> 01:10:33,333
Right at the other side of town.

1021
01:10:34,292 --> 01:10:37,375
It had stopped raining
and I felt stiflingly hot...

1022
01:10:37,583 --> 01:10:40,458
so I sat down on one of the seats.

1023
01:10:40,708 --> 01:10:42,708
There was nobody about
and I lit a cigarette.

1024
01:10:42,750 --> 01:10:45,833
I know how you disapprove
of women smoking in the street.

1025
01:10:45,917 --> 01:10:51,042
I do too, but I thought
it might help calm my nerves.

1026
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:55,125
I sat there for ages.
I don't know how long.

1027
01:10:56,167 --> 01:10:59,250
Then I noticed a policeman.

1028
01:11:00,333 --> 01:11:02,458
He was looking at me
rather suspiciously.

1029
01:11:03,583 --> 01:11:05,542
Presently he came up to me.

1030
01:11:06,667 --> 01:11:09,667
- Feeling all right, Miss?
- Yes, thank you.

1031
01:11:09,875 --> 01:11:14,000
- Waiting for someone?
- No, I'm not waiting for anybody.

1032
01:11:14,042 --> 01:11:18,083
Don't go and catch cold.
It's a damp night.

1033
01:11:18,208 --> 01:11:20,292
I'm going now.
I've got to catch a train.

1034
01:11:21,125 --> 01:11:23,208
You sure you feel
quite all right?

1035
01:11:23,250 --> 01:11:27,458
- Quite, Thank you. Good night.
- Good night, Miss.

1036
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:32,667
I walked away trying to look casual,
knowing he was watching me.

1037
01:11:32,750 --> 01:11:34,750
I felt like a criminal.

1038
01:11:34,875 --> 01:11:37,875
I walked rather quickly
back towards High street.

1039
01:11:38,958 --> 01:11:43,042
I got to the station fifteen minutes
before the last train to Ketchworth.

1040
01:11:43,125 --> 01:11:46,208
I realised that I'd been wandering
for over 3 hours..

1041
01:11:47,125 --> 01:11:49,250
but it didn't seem
any time at all.

1042
01:11:49,417 --> 01:11:51,417
Sten, you are awful!

1043
01:11:52,417 --> 01:11:54,500
- See you in the yard.
- All right.

1044
01:11:57,625 --> 01:12:00,667
- I'd like a glass of brandy, please.
- We're just closing.

1045
01:12:00,750 --> 01:12:02,750
Yes, I can see,
but you're not quite closed.

1046
01:12:02,833 --> 01:12:04,917
- Three Star?
- That'll do.

1047
01:12:10,125 --> 01:12:12,250
Have you got a piece of paper
and an envelope?

1048
01:12:12,333 --> 01:12:16,417
- You'll get that at the bookstall.
- The bookstall's closed.

1049
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:19,500
Please, it's important.
I'd be much obliged.

1050
01:12:19,583 --> 01:12:21,667
All right. Just a minute.

1051
01:12:38,375 --> 01:12:41,375
- Thank you very much.
- We close in a few minutes.

1052
01:12:41,417 --> 01:12:42,500
Yes, I know.

1053
01:13:15,792 --> 01:13:16,875
I've been looking
for you everywhere.

1054
01:13:17,792 --> 01:13:20,000
- Please go away.
- I've watched every train.

1055
01:13:20,083 --> 01:13:23,125
- I can't leave you like this.
- You must. It's better, really.

1056
01:13:24,042 --> 01:13:27,167
You're being dreadfully cruel.
It was an accident he came back.

1057
01:13:27,333 --> 01:13:30,333
He doesn't know you.
I suppose he laughed and you...

1058
01:13:30,500 --> 01:13:32,417
spoke of me as men
of the world.

1059
01:13:32,500 --> 01:13:35,500
We didn't speak of you but
of some nameless creature.

1060
01:13:35,583 --> 01:13:38,667
Why didn't you tell him? That we
were cheap and low and...

1061
01:13:38,708 --> 01:13:41,750
Stop it. Pull yourself together.
It's nothing of the sort.

1062
01:13:42,833 --> 01:13:44,000
We know we love each other.

1063
01:13:44,875 --> 01:13:48,042
- That's all that matters.
- It isn't all that matters...

1064
01:13:48,083 --> 01:13:51,167
self respect matters and decency.
I can't go on any longer.

1065
01:13:54,250 --> 01:13:57,375
Could you really say goodbye
and never see me again?

1066
01:13:59,458 --> 01:14:00,625
Yes, if you'd help me.

1067
01:14:11,125 --> 01:14:15,292
I love you Laura. I shall love you
always until the end of my life.

1068
01:14:18,292 --> 01:14:20,375
I can't look at you now
because I know something.

1069
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:23,583
This is the beginning of the end.

1070
01:14:24,417 --> 01:14:26,750
Not the end of my loving you,
but the end of our being together.

1071
01:14:27,792 --> 01:14:30,708
But please, not quite yet.

1072
01:14:32,875 --> 01:14:34,875
Very well, not quite yet.

1073
01:14:35,917 --> 01:14:39,208
I know how you feel about this
evening, about the sordidness of it.

1074
01:14:40,250 --> 01:14:44,375
I know about the strain of our
different lives, our lives apart.

1075
01:14:45,417 --> 01:14:48,500
The feeling of guilt is too strong.

1076
01:14:49,667 --> 01:14:52,667
Too great a price to pay for the
happiness we'd have together.

1077
01:14:54,833 --> 01:14:57,958
I know all this because
it's the same for me, too.

1078
01:15:01,083 --> 01:15:03,125
You can look at me now.
I'm all right.

1079
01:15:09,333 --> 01:15:12,542
Let's be very careful.
Let's prepare ourselves.

1080
01:15:13,625 --> 01:15:17,625
A sudden break now, however
admirable, would be too cruel.

1081
01:15:17,750 --> 01:15:20,833
We can't do such violence
to our hearts and minds.

1082
01:15:21,875 --> 01:15:22,958
Very well.

1083
01:15:26,125 --> 01:15:29,208
- I'm going away.
- I see.

1084
01:15:29,250 --> 01:15:32,167
- But not quite yet.
- Please, not quite yet.

1085
01:15:35,292 --> 01:15:37,500
- That's the 10: 10. It's closing time.
- Is it?

1086
01:15:37,583 --> 01:15:40,458
- I shall have to lock up.
- All right.

1087
01:15:52,958 --> 01:15:56,083
- Promise me something.
- What is it?

1088
01:15:56,208 --> 01:15:58,333
That however unhappy you are...

1089
01:15:59,208 --> 01:16:02,458
however much you think, you'll
meet me again next Thursday.

1090
01:16:02,583 --> 01:16:05,625
- Where?
- Outside the hospital. 12:30.

1091
01:16:06,667 --> 01:16:09,750
- All right, I promise.
- I've got to talk to you, to explain.

1092
01:16:09,792 --> 01:16:11,792
- About going away?
- Yes.

1093
01:16:11,875 --> 01:16:14,958
Where will you go? You can't
give up your practice.

1094
01:16:16,042 --> 01:16:19,042
I've had a job offer.
I wasn't going to tell you.

1095
01:16:19,125 --> 01:16:22,333
I wasn't going to take it,
but it's the only way out.

1096
01:16:23,292 --> 01:16:26,458
- Where?
- A long way away. Johannesburg.

1097
01:16:28,417 --> 01:16:29,500
Alec...

1098
01:16:29,625 --> 01:16:33,625
My brother's there. They're opening
a new hospital. They want me.

1099
01:16:34,875 --> 01:16:38,792
It's a fine opportunity.
I'll take Madeleine and the boys.

1100
01:16:39,875 --> 01:16:42,958
It's been torturing me, having
to decide one way or another.

1101
01:16:43,125 --> 01:16:46,083
I haven't told anybody,
not even Madeleine.

1102
01:16:47,125 --> 01:16:49,208
I couldn't bear the thought
of leaving you...

1103
01:16:50,333 --> 01:16:52,542
but now I see, it's got to happen
soon anyway.

1104
01:16:54,583 --> 01:16:56,542
It's almost happening already.

1105
01:17:05,958 --> 01:17:07,042
When will you go?

1106
01:17:09,042 --> 01:17:12,250
Almost immediately.
In about two weeks time.

1107
01:17:14,208 --> 01:17:15,375
Quite near isn't it.

1108
01:17:16,375 --> 01:17:18,458
Do you want me to stay? Do you
want me to turn down the offer?

1109
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:20,500
Don't be foolish, Alec.

1110
01:17:20,708 --> 01:17:25,667
- I'll do whatever you say.
- That's unkind of you.

1111
01:17:25,750 --> 01:17:30,875
The train for Ketchworth is now
arriving at Platform 3.

1112
01:17:47,583 --> 01:17:48,833
You're not angry with me,
are you?

1113
01:17:49,708 --> 01:17:53,917
No, I'm not angry. I don't think I'm
anything. I just feel tired.

1114
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:57,125
- Forgive me.
- Forgive you for what?

1115
01:17:58,083 --> 01:17:59,250
For everything.

1116
01:18:00,083 --> 01:18:01,250
For meeting you...

1117
01:18:02,250 --> 01:18:04,333
for taking the grit
out of your eye...

1118
01:18:05,292 --> 01:18:06,375
for loving you...

1119
01:18:06,458 --> 01:18:08,500
for bringing you
so much misery.

1120
01:18:10,708 --> 01:18:12,750
I'll forgive you,
if you'll forgive me.

1121
01:18:22,042 --> 01:18:23,125
Thursday!

1122
01:18:26,083 --> 01:18:27,250
All that was a week ago.

1123
01:18:28,208 --> 01:18:31,417
It's hardly credible
it should be so short a time.

1124
01:18:32,458 --> 01:18:34,542
Today was our last day together.

1125
01:18:34,583 --> 01:18:37,583
Our very last together
in all our lives.

1126
01:18:37,792 --> 01:18:40,875
I met him outside
the hospital at 12:30.

1127
01:18:41,792 --> 01:18:43,792
12:30 this morning.

1128
01:18:44,958 --> 01:18:46,917
That was only this morning.

1129
01:18:47,125 --> 01:18:50,208
We drove into the country again,
but this time he hired a car.

1130
01:18:51,083 --> 01:18:53,250
I lit cigarettes for him
as we went along.

1131
01:18:53,375 --> 01:18:58,417
We didn't talk much. I felt numbed
and hardly alive at all.

1132
01:18:58,583 --> 01:19:00,500
We had lunch in a village pub.

1133
01:19:02,750 --> 01:19:05,792
Afterwards we went
to the same bridge over the stream...

1134
01:19:06,792 --> 01:19:08,833
the bridge that we had
been to before.

1135
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:14,042
Those last few hours
went by so quickly.

1136
01:19:24,667 --> 01:19:27,708
As we walked through the station
I remember thinking...

1137
01:19:28,750 --> 01:19:30,833
"This is the last time with Alec.

1138
01:19:31,958 --> 01:19:34,875
I'll see it all again
but without Alec. "

1139
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
I tried not to think it...

1140
01:19:38,208 --> 01:19:41,208
not to let it spoil
our last moments together.

1141
01:20:07,250 --> 01:20:10,458
- Are you all right, darling?
- Yes, I'm all right.

1142
01:20:12,458 --> 01:20:14,583
I wish I could think
of something to say.

1143
01:20:15,708 --> 01:20:17,667
It doesn't matter,
not saying anything.

1144
01:20:17,750 --> 01:20:21,792
- I'll miss my train and wait for yours.
- I'd rather come to your platform.

1145
01:20:21,875 --> 01:20:22,958
Very well.

1146
01:20:26,125 --> 01:20:29,042
Do you think we'll ever
see each other again?

1147
01:20:30,125 --> 01:20:32,333
I don't know.
Not for years anyway.

1148
01:20:34,292 --> 01:20:36,333
The children will be grown up.

1149
01:20:37,458 --> 01:20:39,542
I wonder if they'll ever meet
and know each other.

1150
01:20:39,583 --> 01:20:41,708
Couldn't I write to you?

1151
01:20:42,583 --> 01:20:46,708
- No, Alec, please. We promised.
- All right, dear.

1152
01:20:46,875 --> 01:20:52,958
I do love you so much. I love you
with all my heart and soul.

1153
01:20:55,250 --> 01:20:57,292
I want to die.

1154
01:20:58,417 --> 01:21:00,417
If only I could die.

1155
01:21:00,458 --> 01:21:04,500
If you died you'd forget me.
I want to be remembered.

1156
01:21:05,667 --> 01:21:07,667
Yes I know. I do too.

1157
01:21:11,917 --> 01:21:16,083
- We've still got a few minutes.
- Laura! What a lovely surprise.

1158
01:21:16,917 --> 01:21:21,083
I've been shopping till I'm dropping.
My throat's parched.

1159
01:21:21,167 --> 01:21:25,333
I'd have had tea in Spindle's but
didn't want to miss the train. Dear!

1160
01:21:25,417 --> 01:21:27,458
- This is Doctor Harvey.
- How do you do.

1161
01:21:27,542 --> 01:21:32,667
Get me my cup of tea would you?
I can't drag my bones to the counter.

1162
01:21:32,708 --> 01:21:33,708
No please...

1163
01:21:33,833 --> 01:21:37,833
It was cruel of fate to be against
us right up to the last minute.

1164
01:21:37,875 --> 01:21:42,083
Dolly Messiter. Poor, well-meaning
irritating Dolly Messiter.

1165
01:21:42,167 --> 01:21:45,292
Crashing into those last precious
minutes we had together.

1166
01:21:46,292 --> 01:21:51,333
She chattered and fussed,
but I didn't hear. I felt dazed.

1167
01:21:51,417 --> 01:21:53,500
- Oh dear. No sugar.
- It's in the spoon.

1168
01:21:53,583 --> 01:21:57,667
Alec behaved so beautifully...
with such perfect politeness.

1169
01:21:57,708 --> 01:21:59,833
Noone could've guessed what
he was really feeling.

1170
01:22:00,833 --> 01:22:01,917
And then...

1171
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
- There's your train.
- Yes, I know.

1172
01:22:06,125 --> 01:22:09,083
- Aren't you coming with us?
- No, I go in the opposite direction.

1173
01:22:09,125 --> 01:22:11,125
- My practice is in Churley.
- I see.

1174
01:22:11,167 --> 01:22:14,333
- I'm a general practitioner.
- Dr. Harvey's going to Africa.

1175
01:22:14,417 --> 01:22:16,333
How thrilling.

1176
01:22:16,417 --> 01:22:23,833
The train on Platform 4 is the
5.40 for Churley, and Langdon.

1177
01:22:24,625 --> 01:22:25,708
- I must go.
- Yes.

1178
01:22:25,750 --> 01:22:26,917
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

1179
01:22:32,083 --> 01:22:35,125
I felt the touch of his hand
for a moment...

1180
01:22:36,167 --> 01:22:37,333
and then he walked away...

1181
01:22:39,375 --> 01:22:41,458
away out of my life forever.

1182
01:22:42,542 --> 01:22:44,500
He's got to get
to the other platform.

1183
01:22:44,583 --> 01:22:47,708
Talking of missing trains reminds me
of the bridge at Broadham junction.

1184
01:22:47,792 --> 01:22:50,792
Dolly went on talking,
but I wasn't listening.

1185
01:22:52,792 --> 01:22:55,000
I was listening for the sound
of his train.

1186
01:22:57,125 --> 01:22:58,208
Then it did.

1187
01:23:01,125 --> 01:23:02,375
I said to myself:
"He didn't go.

1188
01:23:03,333 --> 01:23:06,292
His courage failed
and he couldn't go.

1189
01:23:07,375 --> 01:23:10,625
He'll come back into the room
pretending he's forgotten something. "

1190
01:23:11,542 --> 01:23:12,708
I prayed for that.

1191
01:23:13,625 --> 01:23:15,750
Just so I could see him
for an instant.

1192
01:23:19,833 --> 01:23:21,958
But the minutes went by.

1193
01:23:23,167 --> 01:23:27,083
Is that the train? Is that
the Ketchwork train?

1194
01:23:27,167 --> 01:23:29,208
- No, it's the express.
- The boat train.

1195
01:23:29,292 --> 01:23:31,292
That doesn't stop, does it?

1196
01:23:31,458 --> 01:23:34,458
- I want some chocolate, please.
- Milk or plain?

1197
01:24:03,708 --> 01:24:06,792
I meant to do it, Fred.
I really meant to do it.

1198
01:24:07,875 --> 01:24:09,958
I stood there trembling,
right on the edge.

1199
01:24:12,083 --> 01:24:14,000
But I couldn't.

1200
01:24:14,250 --> 01:24:16,167
I wasn't brave enough.

1201
01:24:18,208 --> 01:24:22,375
I'd like to say it was you and the
children prevented me, but it wasn't.

1202
01:24:23,625 --> 01:24:25,667
I had no thoughts at all.

1203
01:24:27,625 --> 01:24:30,750
Only an overwhelming desire
not to feel anything ever again...

1204
01:24:31,958 --> 01:24:34,000
not to be unhappy anymore.

1205
01:24:34,917 --> 01:24:36,083
I turned...

1206
01:24:38,167 --> 01:24:40,250
and went back in
the Refreshment Room.

1207
01:24:47,583 --> 01:24:49,667
That's when I nearly fainted.

1208
01:25:30,042 --> 01:25:31,042
Laura.

1209
01:25:33,417 --> 01:25:35,250
Yes, dear.

1210
01:25:35,417 --> 01:25:37,417
Whatever your dream was...

1211
01:25:37,500 --> 01:25:39,625
it wasn't a very happy one,
was it?

1212
01:25:42,708 --> 01:25:43,792
No.

1213
01:25:44,750 --> 01:25:46,875
Is there anything
I can do to help?

1214
01:25:49,958 --> 01:25:52,000
Yes, Fred.
You always help.

1215
01:25:52,125 --> 01:25:54,167
You've been
a long way away.

1216
01:25:58,333 --> 01:26:00,417
Thank you
for coming back to me.
