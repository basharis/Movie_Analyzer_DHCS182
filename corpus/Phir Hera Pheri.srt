1
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,900
They say that in life when one
gains something...

2
00:01:11,901 --> 00:01:14,169
then they lose something too...

3
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:18,470
Something like this happened
with our 3 dear friends also.

4
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:24,579
This is Raju. His luck did change.

5
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:31,020
He did get a lot of money. But he
also lost his mother who was ill.

6
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,989
Did you recognize? He is Shyam.

7
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:41,990
He also got a lot of money. But in an
accident he lost his love... Anuradha.

8
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:49,609
And who can forget him! He
is Babu Rao Ganpat Rao Apte.

9
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:54,279
And even he got a lot of money.
As it is he had nothing to lose.

10
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,879
Except for his loincloth.

11
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:59,580
So... he lost his senses.

12
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:13,060
Oh my darling!

13
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:58,670
'Apply kohl in my eyes, beloved."

14
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:03,110
"Decorate anklets in
my leg, beloved."

15
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,289
'Apply kohl in my eyes, beloved."

16
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:12,959
"Decorate anklets in
my leg, beloved."

17
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:16,289
'Decorate me, beloved."

18
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:18,290
Of love...

19
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:25,300
"Make me taste the spicy
sauce of love, beloved."

20
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:04,939
Let the fenugreek from
my heart pour out.

21
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:09,430
And mix the chilies of desire in it.

22
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:15,949
After adding the cinnamon
of intoxication in it.

23
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:20,580
And make me taste it
with your fingers.

24
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:24,759
"Stop making me feel
so restless, beloved."

25
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,759
Of love...

26
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:33,760
"Make me taste the spicy
sauce of love, beloved."

27
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:47,179
'Apply kohl in my eyes, beloved."

28
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:50,789
'Decorate anklets in my leg, beloved."

29
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:54,789
'Apply kohl in my eyes, beloved."

30
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:58,259
'Decorate anklets in my leg, beloved."

31
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:01,799
'Decorate me, beloved."

32
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:07,139
Of love...

33
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:13,279
"Make me taste the spicy
sauce of love, beloved."

34
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,510
- "Hey, Babu-bhaiya!
- Hey, Babu-bhaiya!"

35
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:20,819
- See how much money he has with him.
- He is throwing cheques at her.

36
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,148
Don't take tension of the cheque.

37
00:05:22,149 --> 00:05:23,620
"There should be money in
the bank also, right?"

38
00:05:23,621 --> 00:05:25,250
All the money is in the house.

39
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:39,099
Oh Goddess Laxmi! Bless me.

40
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,439
Hail the telephone!

41
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,169
Hail wrong number!

42
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:44,909
Hail Devi Prasadaya!

43
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:48,109
Hail the rupee and money!

44
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:49,849
'What is this, Babu-bhaiya?"

45
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,379
Why are you sitting on the floor
like a sack of potatoes?

46
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:55,449
- What happened?
- Now we are rich people.

47
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:57,519
So should I sit in air
if we have become rich?

48
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,919
Sit comfortably.

49
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:03,129
Hey! Remove the shoes. One should not
wear shoes in the house and roam.

50
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:06,059
You also Babu-bhaiya... you'll
always remain poor man.

51
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,460
You will always have a cheap thinking.

52
00:06:07,461 --> 00:06:10,129
Rich men sleep on their
sofa with their shoes on.

53
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:11,869
Babu-bhaiya live with style.

54
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,869
Even eat your meals
with spoon and fork.

55
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:17,469
"Ok, how will you eat Indian
burger with spoon and fork?"

56
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:20,879
What is this? I left this
place 15 minutes ago...

57
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,479
and you're still in the same
clothes? Be rich. Rich!

58
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,219
A rich man changes his clothes
every 15 minutes.

59
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,150
He changes his house
every 30 minutes...

60
00:06:29,151 --> 00:06:30,889
and his business every one hour.

61
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,020
- "And changes his wife every 2 hours.
- Oh, God!"

62
00:06:33,021 --> 00:06:34,419
'Oh, God!"

63
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:38,359
Where do I have a wife? The
wife of my neighbours?

64
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,499
"Ok, ok. Forget all that. At
least change this phone."

65
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,900
You've spent all this money but kept...

66
00:06:42,901 --> 00:06:45,169
"...the same number, at
least change the model."

67
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:47,800
Don't touch the phone. Keep it down.

68
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:50,239
'Did I change you? No, right?"

69
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,370
Don't talk about changing this phone.

70
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:55,179
"If you want you change the name,
change the clothes."

71
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,910
Even change your father
if you want but...

72
00:06:56,911 --> 00:06:58,979
don't talk about changing this phone.

73
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:02,580
"This bungalow this car,
this money. These shoes."

74
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:05,250
Even our brief and vest
is because of this phone.

75
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:10,350
This is not just a phone. This
changes luck. Changes luck!

76
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,620
Hello!

77
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,529
Whose phone is it?

78
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:17,129
Kabeera... Kabeera speaking.

79
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:20,599
That... that... tell him that
Baburao has passed away...

80
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,938
'Raju, tell him that Baburao..."

81
00:07:21,939 --> 00:07:23,210
He won't listen to me.

82
00:07:23,211 --> 00:07:29,209
Hey that... that... that... ka...
ka... ka... Kabeera brother.

83
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:31,370
Hail Maharashtra!

84
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,949
Star fisheries... hey you!

85
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,220
You are fooling me.

86
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:37,949
Half of the fish died by
drowning in the water.

87
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,959
And half of the fish died of thirst.

88
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,390
And Baburao's loincloth
has also opened up.

89
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,390
Scoundrel! You open my loincloth!
You dare to open it.

90
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,969
'God, take away..."

91
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:54,730
not a rich guy like me... but take
away these two poor guys.

92
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:08,620
Oh God! The water is very cold.

93
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:19,059
Oh God! What to do about
this Babu-bhaiya?

94
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:22,260
If you give him a mug of
gold then too he'll...

95
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:23,998
We have made such a big swimming pool.

96
00:08:23,999 --> 00:08:26,468
Then why does he have to tie a
rope to a bucket to have bath?

97
00:08:26,469 --> 00:08:28,000
Now what respect will our
neighbors have for us?

98
00:08:28,001 --> 00:08:31,440
- Have I dug a well over here?!
- I will make him understand.

99
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:34,209
'Babu-bhaiya, what are you doing?"

100
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:38,009
The same that you've not done
for last 5 years. I am bathing.

101
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:40,079
Does one bathe like this?

102
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,549
Then how does one bathe?

103
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:44,489
"Why do you need to fetch a bucket
of water with a rope, Babu-bhaiya?"

104
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:47,489
Directly put the bucket in the
water and remove the water.

105
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:49,420
'Raju, he doesn't have common sense."

106
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:52,229
What should I say to them?
This is swimming pool.

107
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:54,028
Why do you need to put
the bucket in it?

108
00:08:54,029 --> 00:08:56,430
- Why don't you directly go in to it?
- How can I dive in to it?

109
00:08:56,431 --> 00:08:58,590
Go like this. Directly.

110
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:07,740
Hello yes... Who Devi Prasad?
Who are you?

111
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:11,940
Anuradha... Laxmi from
Chit fund? Yes say.

112
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,319
Money will be doubled in 21 days.

113
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,950
'No, no. I am interested in the scheme."

114
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:21,659
Yes... I am Devi Prasad only. You
just give me your address.

115
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:24,820
"No, no. For office purpose.
Yes you say."

116
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:30,669
"Jai Ambe Chambers, 27. The
last stop of 4 limited bus."

117
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:33,830
The building opposite that?
Ok... ok... bye.

118
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:40,700
The car has broken down. Will
have to go by the bus.

119
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,679
Ticket! Ticket! Ticket!

120
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,980
- Next stop
- Last stop.

121
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:51,349
"One thousand rupees. Brother,
for 10 rupees are you..."

122
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:53,619
giving me my whole salary?
Give me change.

123
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:55,420
- You must be having change.
- I don't have change.

124
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:57,160
Hurry up! I have to get
down at the next stop.

125
00:09:57,161 --> 00:09:59,699
Do one thing. Give the ticket
for her and her daughter also.

126
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,429
- She is not my daughter.
- Give the ticket for her husband.

127
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:04,098
- "He is not my husband.
- Ok, give..."

128
00:10:04,099 --> 00:10:05,468
me the tickets for both of us. Fine?

129
00:10:05,469 --> 00:10:07,638
Brother if you buy the ticket for all
the passenger in the bus also...

130
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:09,570
then too I won't be able to give
you a change for 1000 rupees.

131
00:10:09,571 --> 00:10:12,239
"Hurry up please, you do one thing
take this and give him a ticket too."

132
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,709
- "Please, hurry up my stop is coming...
- But... - Give the ticket."

133
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:18,379
- Keep this...
- Yes.

134
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:23,080
'Hey, madam. Give me my note at least."

135
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:27,389
'Listen madam, listen to me. Please."

136
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:29,550
'Madam, don't run."

137
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,129
- Madhuri-ji!
- My name is not Madhuri.

138
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:35,060
- Then what is your name?
- What do you have to do with that?

139
00:10:35,061 --> 00:10:38,599
I was asking because you also don't
have any work with me but...

140
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,599
you bought a ticket for me.

141
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,139
My stop was coming. So I was in
a hurry. Should I leave now?

142
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:45,270
You listen to me. Hey! Hey!
Give me one chance.

143
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,740
One chance... one minute. I'll
give you back your money.

144
00:10:47,741 --> 00:10:50,149
- No need.
- Come here please.

145
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,679
Please come here. How much is it for?

146
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,219
- 10 rupees each.
- Give me two.

147
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,150
- I don't want to eat.
- This is very famous over here.

148
00:10:56,151 --> 00:10:57,749
Just have it once and see it.

149
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:00,120
Why are you starring at
my face? Give me 2 fast.

150
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:03,920
Take this. It is very hot.

151
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,429
- Take this hot corn.
- Take this money.

152
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:09,560
"Sir, I don't have the
change for 1000 rupees."

153
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:11,628
You have such a big business
and you don't keep change?

154
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:12,830
Ask from someone.

155
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,439
"Sir, who will give change so early
in the morning for 50 rupees."

156
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,639
'Find it dude, ask him."

157
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,439
'You keep this, keep this. Keep."

158
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,210
"Now it is 30 rupees... listen
to me. Hey, give it!"

159
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:28,340
"What have you done, Nilima-ji? Now
I will have to give you 30 rupees."

160
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,389
See my name is not Nilima.

161
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,788
'And please, stop following me."

162
00:11:31,789 --> 00:11:33,788
How can I leave you like this?
I'll give you your money.

163
00:11:33,789 --> 00:11:35,190
I won't let you do this favor on me.

164
00:11:35,191 --> 00:11:37,789
There is the guy with ice-candy
stall. I'll get the change from him.

165
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:40,459
- But...
- Please come with me.

166
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:42,620
Hey... give us 2 Ice-candy.

167
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:50,100
He is too famous out here...

168
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:54,640
- Take this.
- I don't have change.

169
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,980
Give it back!

170
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,660
I hope you are enjoying it?

171
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:15,990
Stop... stop... thank you!

172
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:20,169
'Come, come."

173
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:21,370
- "Hey! How much?
- 60 rupees, sir. -"

174
00:12:21,371 --> 00:12:22,500
Take this.

175
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:24,708
"Thousand rupees note? I
don't have change, sir."

176
00:12:24,709 --> 00:12:26,240
What to do? You guys don't
keep change only.

177
00:12:26,241 --> 00:12:29,210
All poor people reside here. Whom
should I ask? Nobody has change.

178
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:31,249
What are you doing? ...60 rupees!

179
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,249
"Ok, now it's 110 rupees.
We'll do one thing."

180
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,849
There is a man with horse-cart. He
too is also famous. We will go there.

181
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:38,850
"Enough... I don't want my money.
Just stop following me, please."

182
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:41,220
How can this happen? I'll
give you your money.

183
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:44,259
'Laxmi Chit Fund Fort, Mumbai."

184
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,960
Are they constructing or
demolishing the building?

185
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,710
Do it immediately.

186
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,370
- Hello...
- Hello.

187
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,879
'Good morning, ma'am."

188
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,279
Who are you?

189
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,549
I am Devi Prasad.

190
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:12,619
Devi Prasad? But I know
Devi Prasad personally.

191
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:15,289
- His age must be...
- No... no... you have misunderstood me.

192
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:18,559
- Devi Prasad-ji has sent me.
- Ok. Please have a seat.

193
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,260
Thank you.

194
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:25,299
Tell me one thing. Will you
really double the money?

195
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,699
'Yes, that also in 21 days. Any doubt?"

196
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:30,569
Has Devi Prasad-ji not informed you?

197
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:34,579
"Yes, he told me but your office is
in an under construction building."

198
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:37,309
Where as it should have
been in a good place.

199
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:38,910
"Like Marine drive, Chowpaty,
those places."

200
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,810
Thank you for reminding.

201
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,519
'Mr. Bijlani, what is this?"

202
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:47,319
I got you 10 crore rupees
more from the market.

203
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,320
And you still have not
completed my building?

204
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:50,928
Next month Home minister
is going to come.

205
00:13:50,929 --> 00:13:52,830
Where do you think I
will get him seated?

206
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,760
Don't say it will be completed. It
should be completed... that's good.

207
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,760
Tell me one thing.

208
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:06,879
Will my money also get doubled?

209
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,780
"Sorry sir, our scheme
is for limited people."

210
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:14,349
I too am limited. I eat limited.
I drink limited.

211
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:17,349
I sleep limited. I stay
with limited people.

212
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:20,959
"In fact the bus in which I came,
it was also limited."

213
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,359
You are laughing.

214
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,959
Alright.

215
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,829
I'll give you one chance.

216
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:28,829
But our company's policy is
that we neither take more...

217
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:32,369
than 10 crore rupees nor do
we take less than 1 crore.

218
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:34,060
One crore...

219
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:39,930
- Where will I bring one crore from?
- What happened?

220
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:43,379
"No, I meant how will I bring
it? It's a big amount."

221
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,980
Now how will I bring it from the home?

222
00:14:44,981 --> 00:14:48,379
You will not come with the money.
You just give your address outside.

223
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:49,685
I'll come personally
to take the money.

224
00:14:49,686 --> 00:14:50,989
Yes.

225
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:54,290
You just sign this form
and get it ready.

226
00:14:54,990 --> 00:15:00,160
"I'll come and check your standard
of living, status and bank balance."

227
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:05,069
- Will nothing less then a crore do?
- I'm sorry.

228
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,670
- "Complete one crore?
- Yes, one crore."

229
00:15:06,671 --> 00:15:08,360
Good policy.

230
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:12,539
"Is this the estate agent? Yes, listen
Hand over the phone to Banwari."

231
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:17,949
"Banwari, I am Raju speaking. Ok,
listen I want a bungalow."

232
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:20,419
That also between a race
course and golf course.

233
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,419
And I want a private
pond in it which...

234
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:23,950
should have water-proof
fishes in it.

235
00:15:23,951 --> 00:15:28,180
And I also want a stadium and
a Multiplex to watch movies.

236
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:31,850
'Ok, I will call you later. Bye."

237
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:38,429
Hey Raju! Raju! Have you won
8-10 lotteries together?

238
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:43,439
"Poor people buy lotteries,
Babu-bhaiya. I do business."

239
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,939
What business? What is it?

240
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:46,870
I'll tell you.

241
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:51,449
"How did this Tata, Birla, Ambani
and Devi Prasad get rich?"

242
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:55,449
- I know the secret.
- Do they smoke cigarette?

243
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:57,250
"Not cigarette
Babu-bhaiya, it's secret.

244
00:15:57,251 --> 00:15:59,050
Secret?"

245
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:02,459
What they do is that they put
the entire money in Chit fund.

246
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:04,729
And after 21 days our
money will be doubled.

247
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:06,998
Again 21 days later the money
will increase four times.

248
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:09,060
- And 21 days later again the money...
- 8 times.

249
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:10,729
- After that...
- 16 times.

250
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:12,560
32 times.

251
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:16,430
That's why I am leaving 5-5
crores for each one of you.

252
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:20,078
"Babu-bhaiya, you don't come into
the sweet talks of this fraud."

253
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,480
"Forget the crores, this guy
will get us on the roads."

254
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:27,549
"No, dear. My right eye is
flickering since morning."

255
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:30,920
I feel that we surely will
become millionaire.

256
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:34,910
Had this been the case then every
blind man would have been a millionaire.

257
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:38,489
Lord Ganpati Bappa.

258
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:42,120
Hail Lord Vinayaka!

259
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:47,499
- "Give it, man. Give it.
- What should I give?"

260
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,500
You said you will give me five crores.

261
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:53,170
The moment you see a rich
man you start begging.

262
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,010
"Let me invest first, you people
bring the money."

263
00:16:55,011 --> 00:16:56,179
What?

264
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:58,648
Give 10-10 lakh rupees each
and sign on the form.

265
00:16:58,649 --> 00:17:00,518
- "No, I won't give it.
- Even I won't give."

266
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:01,780
I want 1 crore rupees.

267
00:17:01,781 --> 00:17:04,789
If I invest that 21 days later
I'll get 2 crore rupees.

268
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:07,789
'Read this, you are educated, right?"

269
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:10,550
'Read it. Read what is written, read."

270
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:15,799
"Yes, it is written that the
money will double in 21days."

271
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,598
Put one crore rupees
and it will double.

272
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,600
Is it written that it will double?
Give it over here.

273
00:17:19,601 --> 00:17:21,799
I have full trust in you.

274
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,500
I will give you my 10 lakh rupees.

275
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:31,500
'Come on, now you sign."

276
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:36,549
Something is fishy. Something is.

277
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:38,150
- What happened?
- Did you hear something?

278
00:17:38,151 --> 00:17:40,619
This guy always hears
something or the other.

279
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:43,220
There is no song on. No radio or T.V.

280
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:46,829
'You sign, man, sign, come on, sign."

281
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,559
Something is fishy. Something is.

282
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:51,569
- "I can hear. You all also...
- Sign, buddy. Come on!"

283
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:56,000
Please... sign...

284
00:17:57,110 --> 00:18:00,779
That is alright but we
have 30 lakhs rupees.

285
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,110
From where are we going to get
the rest of the 70 lakhs?

286
00:18:03,111 --> 00:18:05,579
- Do you people trust me?
- Yes.

287
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,179
I have full faith in God.

288
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:09,919
I will get 70 lakh rupees from
somewhere or the other.

289
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,189
Fine then? Ok.

290
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:14,119
He is a very nice person.

291
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:17,659
"Babu-bhaiya, you are falling
for the same trick again."

292
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:21,030
'Hey, don't curse it."

293
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:27,030
"Oh God, I just hope my
money gets doubled."

294
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:33,360
Raju!

295
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,380
Again the car has stopped.

296
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:47,050
Where will I get 70 lakhs from?

297
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,228
"Brother, it's itching very much.
If I could get some work..."

298
00:18:52,229 --> 00:18:53,860
Till the time your brother is
alive you don't have...

299
00:18:53,861 --> 00:18:56,060
to worry about any money.

300
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:59,630
If you take me as your bhai then your
promotion will happen quickly.

301
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:03,070
- Understood?
- Yes.

302
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:16,049
If you people have any problem
just remember bhai.

303
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:17,250
Whether you want money or anything.

304
00:19:17,251 --> 00:19:20,090
- Hey Chhotu.
- Coming sir...

305
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:22,550
Get a cup of tea.

306
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:26,560
- I don't have change.
- This is your tip.

307
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:28,929
- "1000 rupees?
- This is a tip, a tip."

308
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:30,669
A tip of thousand rupees?

309
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:33,100
'I'll pay for the tea later, now go."

310
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:36,430
How much pollution is
there in this country?

311
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:52,689
"Hey junior, send someone
to my bungalow."

312
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:56,120
Why don't you fit 3 to 4 AC's
here? It's so hot in here.

313
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,690
"Hey, sir. If you have
so much problem..."

314
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,258
then why don't you have
tea at a five star hotel?

315
00:20:01,259 --> 00:20:02,700
'Dear, we have become habituated."

316
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:05,099
There was a time when
even we were poor.

317
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:09,590
- We became millionaires overnight.
- How?

318
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:12,330
Millionaires in 25 days.

319
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,730
Millionaires in 25 days?

320
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:19,179
Do I look like I'm a simpleton?

321
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:20,980
Do you have a counterfeit
money business?

322
00:20:20,981 --> 00:20:23,680
Not a business... this...

323
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:27,350
'Shift, shift over there."

324
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,320
I have a scheme.

325
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:32,160
I have found the scheme of the rich.

326
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:35,329
Money doubled within 25 days.

327
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:37,820
Money doubled within 25 days?

328
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:42,570
Even I want to double my money.

329
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:45,339
This scheme is not for
any Tom Dick and Harry.

330
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:48,279
You need to have high
contacts for this.

331
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,349
'Hey, please go get tea, buddy."

332
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:52,010
"Brother, you... you have
recently made contacts."

333
00:20:52,011 --> 00:20:54,749
"Hey, get my special tea for brother.
Brother... brother."

334
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,749
It's been so long since
I've known you.

335
00:20:56,750 --> 00:21:00,019
"Brother, it's already passed
7 minutes, brother."

336
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:03,959
"Okay... fine, fine, I've
put a minimum of 70..."

337
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:09,029
- Tea.
- Have you added sugar?

338
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:12,769
'Get sugar for, sir... go and get it."

339
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:14,299
'Brother, brother."

340
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:16,300
I'll need at least 70
lakh rupees for this.

341
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:17,769
70 lakhs!

342
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:20,040
If you speak so loudly you'll
tell everyone about the scheme.

343
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:22,039
But I don't have 70 lakh rupees.

344
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,779
Then I want 50 lakhs. There is
no scheme for less than that.

345
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:27,779
50 lakhs? And then my
work won't be done.

346
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:29,750
'Listen, listen to me."

347
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:31,680
Don't be so depressed.

348
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:36,189
There is another scheme in my
head which is of 30 lakhs.

349
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:40,220
30 lakhs? But I have only 20 lakhs.

350
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:43,399
- "Do something, brother.
- Okay then, fine."

351
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:46,130
'Do a thing, where is the money?"

352
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:48,198
"It's just next door and
that too in cash, cash."

353
00:21:48,199 --> 00:21:50,138
- "Can you get it right now?
- Yes, I can get it now, brother."

354
00:21:50,139 --> 00:21:51,808
"Do a thing, then, get the
money at my mansion."

355
00:21:51,809 --> 00:21:53,810
"Yes, brother, you go to your
mansion; I'll get the..."

356
00:21:53,811 --> 00:21:56,240
- "...money and reach there.
- Okay, go, go."

357
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,240
I still need 50 lakh rupees more.

358
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:05,684
"Brother, what is the
guarantee for this?

359
00:22:05,685 --> 00:22:06,818
What guarantee?"

360
00:22:06,819 --> 00:22:08,020
'Yes, I will require some security."

361
00:22:08,021 --> 00:22:10,089
- "No, no brother, security.
- You go back."

362
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:10,960
"No, no.

363
00:22:10,961 --> 00:22:12,230
Son, this scheme is
not meant for you."

364
00:22:12,231 --> 00:22:13,829
- "No, brother.
- You go back."

365
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:15,828
- "You go back. No, brother.
- This scheme is not for you."

366
00:22:15,829 --> 00:22:17,428
- Brother forgive me.
- You go away.

367
00:22:17,429 --> 00:22:19,830
"Hey, take the money and go get
some sweets for your kids."

368
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:20,969
'No, no, no."

369
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:22,838
There is a scheme of
10 rupees for you.

370
00:22:22,839 --> 00:22:24,370
"No, no, I have full
confidence in you."

371
00:22:24,371 --> 00:22:25,909
I'll go and get it right away.

372
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:27,109
Okay.

373
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:28,838
- I'll reach your bungalow right now.
- Okay.

374
00:22:28,839 --> 00:22:30,040
- "You will come, won't you?
- Yes."

375
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:31,980
- "Sure?
- I'll come, 100 percent. -"

376
00:22:31,981 --> 00:22:33,540
Okay.

377
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:41,859
"Hey scoundrel, we are
working over here..."

378
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,389
and you are just strolling
over there.

379
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:46,620
I'm arranging for 20 lakh rupees.

380
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:49,128
"Forget it, is that 20 lakh rupees
going to walk and come to you?"

381
00:22:49,129 --> 00:22:50,400
Something like that.

382
00:22:50,401 --> 00:22:55,300
"Why, does the 20 lakh
rupees not have..."

383
00:22:56,140 --> 00:23:00,300
"That was a good joke. Laugh,
you jerk! Laugh at it!"

384
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:05,880
'Babu-bhaiya, a man is going to come."

385
00:23:05,881 --> 00:23:07,879
I have lured him perfectly.

386
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:10,889
Oh God! This alcohol is such.
It intoxicates...

387
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:12,850
even the biggest of them.

388
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:17,889
'Hey, why were you coughing all night?"

389
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:20,290
"Go and have a sip or two
from my bottle, go."

390
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,899
Why? Will my cough reduce
by having alcohol?

391
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:25,499
Because of liquor my father
lost his garage.

392
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,439
The entire property was lost.

393
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,170
'Even my father passed away, then..."

394
00:23:29,171 --> 00:23:31,169
why won't your cough go away?

395
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:32,909
Boss... boss... he is coming.

396
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:36,440
"No one will say anything,
no one, understood?"

397
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:38,979
If no one says anything then
what will anything say?

398
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:41,180
"Yes, this is a problem,
what should be said then?"

399
00:23:41,181 --> 00:23:44,389
Don't roam with him you will go mad.

400
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:47,350
You go. Go and do your work.

401
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:57,630
Hey! You came so soon.

402
00:23:58,130 --> 00:23:59,930
- Money has come.
- Yes.

403
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:03,370
'Hey, this is a Lavni folk dancer."

404
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:05,539
This is...

405
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:09,479
"This is my gardener. Hey, Babu,
water them properly."

406
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:14,219
"You scoundrel, from Babu-bhaiya
it's now just, Babu?"

407
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:16,149
I'll have to deal with you later.

408
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:18,420
Is he your gardener? But on
that day over there he was...

409
00:24:18,421 --> 00:24:20,720
'Blowing money over there, I know."

410
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,959
The thing is that whenever he gets
his salary he gives it to me.

411
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,959
I double it and give it to him and...

412
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,930
he goes there and blows the money.

413
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:33,498
Even he was over there on that day.

414
00:24:33,499 --> 00:24:35,440
"Hey driver, hey driver, didn't
I tell you to remove the..."

415
00:24:35,441 --> 00:24:37,569
money from the trunk
and keep it inside.

416
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:39,400
Hey shut up.

417
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,580
He is telling you to shut up.

418
00:24:43,581 --> 00:24:45,579
He is like my father.

419
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:48,579
I was five since then he has taken
care of me and raised me.

420
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:50,420
He has been my driver since then.

421
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:54,420
Five years? But he looks to
be of the same age as of you.

422
00:24:56,530 --> 00:24:59,080
Have you heard of plastic surgery?

423
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:03,420
"I've spent four crore rupees,
there's plastic on his face."

424
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:05,600
I've even made him join the gym.

425
00:25:05,601 --> 00:25:07,830
Does he look like he's 60 years old?

426
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,340
If you have money then everything...
is possible.

427
00:25:11,341 --> 00:25:14,279
- "Have you got the money?
- Yes, I've got it."

428
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,608
'Brother, sit inside and count it."

429
00:25:15,609 --> 00:25:17,548
"There is nothing inside,
we people don't sit."

430
00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:19,610
- You might have at least some water?
- Who drinks water?

431
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:21,620
The water is only for the plants.
We only have beer.

432
00:25:21,621 --> 00:25:24,019
"Save water, drink beer,
that's our motto."

433
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:26,019
"Hey, brother, will it
double in 25 days?"

434
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:29,050
- "If you give the money it will double.
- Yes, yes, take this."

435
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:31,560
- "Brother, I'll come after 25 days.
- Okay."

436
00:25:31,561 --> 00:25:35,660
- "Fine then, brother.
- Okay."

437
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:41,369
"What scoundrel, you
called me a gardener?"

438
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:44,309
"Babu-bhaiya, we have
got 20 lakh rupees."

439
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:47,039
Driver? You look like a thief
with those dark glasses.

440
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,800
And you call me a driver?

441
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:54,940
- Scouundrel...
- Wait...

442
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:02,059
'Oh God, what will these people from..."

443
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,589
the Lakshmi chit fund ask me now.

444
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:07,059
Delhi's capital is India.

445
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:10,060
"Raju, you had said that the
people of the Laxmi fund..."

446
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:12,269
won't take any investments
below 1 crore.

447
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:13,398
That's correct.

448
00:26:13,399 --> 00:26:15,340
We have thirty and you
took twenty from him.

449
00:26:15,341 --> 00:26:17,069
From where will we get 50?

450
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:19,270
This is fifty and this is the
other 50. And it is 1 now.

451
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,080
"Wow, that's good, you've already
started to double it."

452
00:26:21,081 --> 00:26:22,209
Very good.

453
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:23,740
From where did you get this fifty?

454
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:26,510
I will give double to the
person whom I took it from.

455
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:31,780
'Oh, there she comes, there she comes."

456
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:56,109
'Welcome, welcome."

457
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:57,509
This is Anuradha.

458
00:26:57,510 --> 00:27:01,540
Anuradha? Is your name
Anuradha as well?

459
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:05,880
What do you mean? Is your
name Anuradha as well?

460
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:10,090
- "Of course not, I am.
- Forget it, this is Shyam."

461
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:14,399
"My name is Baburao, Baburao
Ganpat Rao Apte."

462
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,129
"Come, let us go inside and speak.
It's very sunny, come."

463
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:19,900
Shyam... nice name.

464
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:22,900
Anuradha?

465
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:27,139
- Nice coffee.
- Thank you. - Beautiful house.

466
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:30,110
'Thanks a lot. Here, take the papers."

467
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:35,630
"Great, Mr. Shyam,
have you done M. Com?

468
00:27:35,631 --> 00:27:37,910
Yes."

469
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:44,559
'Mr. Raju, which degree is this ITUS?"

470
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,580
To fool people.

471
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:51,169
"Yes, actually, it's International
Talent..."

472
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:54,439
of Ultimate Students... ITUS.

473
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,169
I've never heard anything about...

474
00:27:56,170 --> 00:27:58,440
- a degree like this.
- You won't even hear about it.

475
00:27:58,441 --> 00:28:01,309
Because this is a very
difficult course.

476
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:02,878
A very few number of students
are able to do it.

477
00:28:02,879 --> 00:28:04,580
"You know, you have to
be very intelligent."

478
00:28:04,581 --> 00:28:08,579
- And I was one of them.
- That's strange.

479
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:13,750
- "Hey, hey, this is my degree.
- This? - Yes."

480
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:17,459
This looks like the school leaving
certificate of some Marathi school.

481
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:19,620
Till where have you studied?

482
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,630
- Till afternoon.
- What?

483
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:26,199
My father dropped me at
school in the morning.

484
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,199
And the whole school came
to drop me home...

485
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,640
in the afternoon with
this certificate.

486
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:34,640
"Anuradha-ji, I want to
ask you a question."

487
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:37,549
What kind of business does
your company do because...

488
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:40,610
of which our entire money
gets doubled in 21 days?

489
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:41,749
Shit.

490
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:44,980
- That's a very intelligent question.
- Thank you.

491
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:49,889
"Yes, see, the foreign company
in which our company invests."

492
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:53,229
They double our money and
return it to us in 7 days.

493
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:55,265
"Oh, oh, I see.

494
00:28:55,266 --> 00:28:57,299
Raju, let us go
directly over there..."

495
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,829
'Keep quiet, Babu-bhaiya."

496
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:01,769
- "Are you satisfied, Mr. Shyam?
- Yes, sure."

497
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:04,330
The money of all the three
of you will be doubled.

498
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:08,130
'Not claps. Give me the money, money."

499
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,778
'Take this, the receipt is in this."

500
00:29:10,779 --> 00:29:12,350
That's fifty lakhs in this
and fifty lakhs in that.

501
00:29:12,351 --> 00:29:15,579
- It's 1 crore.
- Congratulations.

502
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:18,519
"That's it, in a few days from
now I'll make you millionaires."

503
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:21,259
I just want to be a husband.

504
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:23,260
I am telling you let's get him
married. We will take his money.

505
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:24,950
"- Ok, bye."

506
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:28,700
21 Days Later

507
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,599
"Hey Raju, then where is
your office located?"

508
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,270
'Hey, what's this? In this building?"

509
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:35,960
'Look at this, where is the office?"

510
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:39,609
- Where is our money?
- This is just a ruin.

511
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:41,279
Where is the office?

512
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:44,879
"Hey move, there was a Laxmi
chit fund office over here."

513
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,549
'That board, where did it go?"

514
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:48,480
I myself am looking for that office.

515
00:29:48,481 --> 00:29:50,380
'The office was here, right?"

516
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:54,289
"He was here even on that day. Where
is that girl, tell me fast."

517
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:57,289
"Hey brother, we have come here
to take our doubled money."

518
00:29:57,290 --> 00:29:59,829
They said we'll get paid double
and gave us the job.

519
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:01,900
"Today when we came over here,
everyone had vanished."

520
00:30:01,901 --> 00:30:03,360
- What?
- What?

521
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:06,299
My head has started spinning.

522
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:08,740
I couldn't recognise her.

523
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:16,309
"Do not trust this Raju,
he will bankrupt us."

524
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:18,309
Don't give him the money.

525
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:20,919
"That's what I thought, that
girl was so innocent."

526
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:23,519
What did I know that she
will ditch us and go?

527
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,719
How can my Anuradha do such a thing?

528
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:28,859
"Hey, keep quiet, your Anuradha,
you scoundrel, jerk."

529
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,929
Why are you hitting me?
What have I done?

530
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:34,329
You are the biggest unlucky charm.

531
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:37,329
Because of you... But why
are you hitting me?

532
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:39,329
'It hurts, have both of you gone mad?"

533
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:43,770
"Here, take this, take this
and hit him on the head."

534
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:52,250
"You will double it, you will double
it now I won't spare you."

535
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:56,349
What are you doing?

536
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:59,789
You will double it?

537
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:01,358
"Anuradha is your sister,
where is your sister?"

538
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:02,518
Where is your sister?
Who is Anuradha?

539
00:31:02,519 --> 00:31:04,358
"I don't have any sister? Where
is your sister, tell me?"

540
00:31:04,359 --> 00:31:05,830
"Babu-bhaiya, what is
this you are doing?"

541
00:31:05,831 --> 00:31:07,629
He is not Anuradha's brother.

542
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:09,960
If this is not Anuradha's brother
then she is Anuradha.

543
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:12,369
"Scoundrel, you've put
a false moustache?"

544
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:14,839
"Babu-bhaiya, this cannot
be my Anuradha."

545
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:19,330
He is a man. How can he be Anuradha?

546
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,810
'Hey, have you gone mad?"

547
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:29,719
'Babu-bhaiya, calm down."

548
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,520
"Babu-bhaiya, agreed that the
scoundrel Raju,"

549
00:31:31,521 --> 00:31:33,650
lost our 30 lakh rupees.

550
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:36,059
But we still have our
house of 50 lakhs.

551
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,350
We still have a house.

552
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:43,460
'Oh God, I had forgotten about it."

553
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:46,430
We still have a mansion
worth 50 lakhs.

554
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:51,009
"Hey Raju, you scoundrel, you give
me the papers of the mansion."

555
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:52,340
Otherwise you will
sell the house as well.

556
00:31:52,341 --> 00:31:53,670
Take it.

557
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,840
He can't be trusted.

558
00:31:56,680 --> 00:32:00,949
Did you understand?
Why doesn't he speak?

559
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:04,180
"Hey brother, do we still
have this mansion?"

560
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:07,689
- We had the mansion.
- What?

561
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:10,180
Does that mean you sold the house?

562
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:14,429
So hadn't you asked me from where
the remaining 50 lakhs came from?

563
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:21,430
"I will kill you. Babu-bhaiya,
hey Babu-bhaiya. Hey Raju."

564
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:24,969
Come on soon. Isn't there
petrol inside you.

565
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:26,870
Who is this?

566
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,838
'Hey, I struck a lottery."

567
00:32:28,839 --> 00:32:30,780
'25 days are over, from today even..."

568
00:32:30,781 --> 00:32:32,449
I will be called a millionaire.

569
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,449
'Money has doubled. Hey Lord, I will..."

570
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:36,719
even offer you double
number of coconuts.

571
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,450
- Take this.
- What are you doing?

572
00:32:38,451 --> 00:32:41,919
"Take this, all slavery
over from today."

573
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,520
Where are you going?

574
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:46,080
Have you come for the
job of a watchman?

575
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:48,659
'Hey you cook, go and call your master."

576
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:51,890
What call the master? I'm
the master over here.

577
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:55,069
'Hey lord, you are great!"

578
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:57,000
"Every one from the driver,
the gardener..."

579
00:32:57,010 --> 00:32:59,440
to the cook is rich in this house.

580
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:01,480
Raju brother must have doubled
your money as well.

581
00:33:01,481 --> 00:33:03,009
Now even I want to take my double.

582
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:07,010
'Hey Raju brother, I have come."

583
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:09,019
Does this sofa belong to your father?

584
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:11,749
"It belongs to Raju brother,
Raju brother!"

585
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:14,489
- Raju brother has gone bankrupt.
- What?

586
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:17,320
He sold this mansion to
me 25 days ago and left.

587
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:21,499
If I don't get my money
I'll surely die.

588
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:24,769
"Not here, go outside
and die on the road."

589
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:28,499
"Tell me where that Raju is,
or else I'll kill you."

590
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,700
I can tell only if you leave my neck.

591
00:33:29,701 --> 00:33:31,839
"No, you tell me first otherwise
I'll kill you."

592
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,540
- "Son, leave my neck, I'll tell you.
- Here."

593
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:36,109
Will you hit me?

594
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:38,709
'This shorty will hit me, is it?"

595
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:41,579
You will hit me? Now I will show you.

596
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:46,519
Do you know me? I have
robbed guns from...

597
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:49,519
I'll kill you with these
two antique guns.

598
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:52,150
'I won't spare you, I won't spare you."

599
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:04,809
Hey! Don't hold it like this. Hold
it like a cigarette or a pipe.

600
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:07,970
This is Baburao's style. You click.

601
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:11,079
- "How is it?
- Yes, it's great."

602
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:13,810
Great? Then do I get the
role in your drama?

603
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:15,750
These clothes are bought
on rent. Take them off.

604
00:34:15,751 --> 00:34:17,149
- "On rent?
- Yes, so."

605
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:19,550
Your role in the drama is that
you are the father of the hero.

606
00:34:19,551 --> 00:34:20,689
Father?

607
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:24,159
Who is dead. Now we will put
your photo on the stage.

608
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:26,590
That also with a plastic
garland over it.

609
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:30,160
Hey you! I'll hit you with a bucket.

610
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:32,000
You'll never ask for water.

611
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:35,530
Look at the riches of the bungalow
and at the queue for water.

612
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:40,400
Hey Shyam! Hey Raju!

613
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:47,579
Hey Smarty!

614
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:51,189
"Not smarty, Apte. Baburao
Ganpat Rao Apte."

615
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:52,920
'Hey you maybe Apte or Jhapte, don't..."

616
00:34:52,921 --> 00:34:56,189
- "...dry your clothes over here.
- It's wet, dear. Let me dry."

617
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:58,020
This is my balcony (Shift).

618
00:34:58,590 --> 00:35:00,620
Night shift or day shift?

619
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:01,999
Are you new over here?

620
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,260
"No, it's old. But I
have just washed it."

621
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:05,930
That's why it's looking first class.

622
00:35:05,931 --> 00:35:09,030
This is my balcony...
in front of my door.

623
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:12,630
It seems as if this place
belongs to your father?

624
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:15,139
Then what your father?

625
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:18,609
"Yes, my father has a big place
to stay in Kolhapur."

626
00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:22,380
Then go and dry your clothes
in Kolhapur. Not here.

627
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:25,089
"Dear, if I dry my loincloth
in Kolhapur."

628
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:27,050
Then what will I wear over here?

629
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:30,060
Now should I burst you?

630
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:33,629
Do I look like a balloon to you?
That you will burst me?

631
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:37,060
I'll throw you down from here.

632
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:39,169
So I'll come up by the stairs.

633
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:40,630
Let me solve the problem.

634
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,970
Now I'll have to show you.

635
00:35:41,971 --> 00:35:43,569
I'll also show you.

636
00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:45,310
- What will you do?
- What will you do?

637
00:35:45,311 --> 00:35:49,109
- What will you do?
- I'll dry the loincloth over here?

638
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:52,649
- "You don't know me.
- What will I do by knowing you, dear?"

639
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:57,610
- Who are you?
- Then know me.

640
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:02,119
'Come on, Babu-bhaiya."

641
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:09,120
Hold me. He doesn't know me... hold me.

642
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:12,669
"Hit him hard. You hold me...
I'll not leave you, jerk."

643
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:17,100
Leave me... I will not spare him.

644
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:19,840
"Hey Tambi, have you seen that
Raju sir? -"

645
00:36:19,841 --> 00:36:21,139
Who Raju?

646
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:23,940
"That... that, the one who had given
your boy a 1000 rupees tip."

647
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:26,209
- To him.
- Who him?

648
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:27,750
'Yes, had he not given you 1000rupees?"

649
00:36:27,751 --> 00:36:29,179
He is a fraud.

650
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:31,018
He gives you a tip of 1000 rupees
before drinking the tea.

651
00:36:31,019 --> 00:36:33,020
"And after he drank it, he'll slap
you and take the money back."

652
00:36:33,021 --> 00:36:34,689
He drinks tea also on loans.

653
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:36,590
Make 4 special tea. I'll just come.

654
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,330
I'll not leave that jerk.

655
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:52,709
I will give you 150 rupees.

656
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,709
150 for one that means
300 for 2 right?

657
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:57,309
A man buys a pair of shoes
whenever he buys it.

658
00:36:57,310 --> 00:37:00,249
Don't make a fool of Kachra-bhai.

659
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:02,865
"Sir, it's made in Japan.

660
00:37:02,866 --> 00:37:05,480
So sell it in the
Thief market of Japan."

661
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:10,720
"First the Laxmi fund has ruined
us, now you also ruin us."

662
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:11,988
'Come on take this, pull it."

663
00:37:11,989 --> 00:37:13,258
'Don't fool with me, Babu-bhaiya."

664
00:37:13,259 --> 00:37:14,730
I am getting late for the interview.

665
00:37:14,731 --> 00:37:18,269
"There were 4 imported shoes, but
now not even one is to be found."

666
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:20,799
Yesterday night I hit Raju
with the shoes on his head.

667
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,339
It were there at that time.

668
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:24,240
"Hey Shyam! Take this, I have
brought the money for the..."

669
00:37:24,241 --> 00:37:25,740
bread for one time and money...

670
00:37:25,741 --> 00:37:29,370
"...for the beer, for 2
times for Babu-bhaiya."

671
00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:33,009
So from where have you brought
this money for food?

672
00:37:33,010 --> 00:37:35,279
What is money? It is just
the dirt on the hand.

673
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,750
Then you should have you
told me beforehand...

674
00:37:36,751 --> 00:37:39,949
I just had a good bath.
And I cleaned all the dirt.

675
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:41,150
Give me the bottle.

676
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,759
I have to go for an interview.
Has anyone seen my shoes?

677
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,088
- You have to go for an interview?
- Yes.

678
00:37:45,089 --> 00:37:46,758
Then you should have told
me before I would have...

679
00:37:46,759 --> 00:37:47,900
sold our shoes after your interview?

680
00:37:47,901 --> 00:37:51,769
- You sold away my shoes?
- Nothing else was left to sell.

681
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:54,769
'Babu, brother this..."

682
00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:56,100
It will tear... it will tear.

683
00:37:56,101 --> 00:37:59,769
Your vest is already torn now what
will I wear beneath the suit?

684
00:37:59,770 --> 00:38:00,910
Should I roam around with slippers?

685
00:38:00,911 --> 00:38:03,779
Leave me... leave me...
see this poor guy.

686
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:08,049
Has he said a word? I sold
his watch and golden specs?

687
00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:09,850
Did the poor guy say any thing?!
He didn't right?

688
00:38:09,851 --> 00:38:13,789
You sold the watch?
You sold my brief?

689
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:16,789
"You jerk, I'll sell
your vest and brief."

690
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:23,059
Will you give me your vest? Take this.

691
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:27,690
Your bottle fell down. What tell me?

692
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:31,269
Now say. Now say. What will
you do with a watch?

693
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:33,269
As it is your time is bad.

694
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:35,339
Jerk! Now your time
has come to an end.

695
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:36,810
'Babu-bhaiya, don't spare him."

696
00:38:36,811 --> 00:38:42,819
- "First you catch him, dear.
- Raju, scoundrel!"

697
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:45,089
You jerk! You sold off my watch.

698
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:47,089
- I'll not give you food.
- Your food.

699
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:49,450
You'll not give me food?

700
00:38:50,090 --> 00:38:56,260
You hit me? You hit me? He
hit me. This jerk hit me.

701
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:06,270
Maratha man has woken up!

702
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:13,109
"Babu, come, come. Babu, come.
Murder him, Babu, murder him."

703
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:16,280
Hey! You leave me... leave me.

704
00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:21,290
Hey! Leave my ears! Leave my ears.

705
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:27,190
This is my nose... this is my nose.

706
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:30,290
Leave me... leave me...

707
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:46,310
'Babu-bhaiya, a girl has come."

708
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,479
When did I say it is a boy?

709
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:53,580
'Babu-bhaiya, it is gone."

710
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:58,860
Get your spectacles corrected. She
has not gone. She is still here.

711
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:04,600
Your loincloth.

712
00:40:04,601 --> 00:40:08,100
She has worn a dress
and not a lioncloth.

713
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:12,610
Your loincloth has come out.

714
00:40:19,310 --> 00:40:22,610
"What are doing there?
The girl is here, wear your dhoti."

715
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:29,480
- Changing.
- Tie it tightly.

716
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:34,760
How are you?

717
00:40:35,530 --> 00:40:40,199
- How come you are here?
- I have come for the rent.

718
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:43,339
"What about rent, dear? Give whatever
you feel like giving, ok."

719
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:46,360
No! I have come to take the rent.

720
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:48,879
Then take it from Raju.

721
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,900
Are you the owner of this chawl?

722
00:40:51,210 --> 00:40:54,210
"No, my father is the accountant
of this place."

723
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:57,380
Since he is not keeping well.
I have come to take the rent.

724
00:40:57,550 --> 00:40:59,219
Give me 175 rupees.

725
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:02,159
'Yes, take this."

726
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:05,559
"Where did you bring this 1000
rupees from, you jerk?"

727
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:07,559
I'll buy my shoes from it.

728
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,160
Will you wear the shoes
over the towel?

729
00:41:09,161 --> 00:41:11,229
He is not a beggar like
you. He has a suit.

730
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:14,030
I sold his suit and got this money.

731
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,370
I don't have a change of 1000 rupees.

732
00:41:15,371 --> 00:41:18,239
So let's go out and have a coffee
will get the change done.

733
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,969
No need for that.

734
00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:23,979
Listen Rekha-ji... Seema-ji... Meena-ji.

735
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:26,309
I'll get the change for you.

736
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:28,049
That jerk sold my suit!

737
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:30,980
"That jerk has sold my watch,
my golden specs."

738
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:33,049
I'll not leave him. Now see.

739
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:35,319
'Yes, beat him. Don't spare him!"

740
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:42,320
Listen to me... listen to me.
We'll have a coffee together.

741
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:45,960
'Sister, just give me this..."

742
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:51,269
Break his skull... break
this jerk's skull.

743
00:41:51,270 --> 00:41:53,609
Where is my suit? Where
is my one-piece suit?

744
00:41:53,610 --> 00:41:57,440
I will get you a 2 piece one. Sit
in the swimming pool with it.

745
00:41:58,610 --> 00:42:02,450
- Thief. - You are a thief.
- Break his head. - - Hey Babu!

746
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:10,359
Go and bring my suit. Or else
I'll break your skull.

747
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:14,290
"Don't be mad Shyam, I'll get
hurt with that vessel."

748
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:18,790
Shyam hit him. Hit and
break his skull.

749
00:42:24,570 --> 00:42:29,480
- "Babu-bhaiya, he hit you. Hit him.
- He did!"

750
00:42:32,310 --> 00:42:36,579
What 4000? When I sold you
this suit you gave me 1000.

751
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:38,519
Now 4000? 300 % profit?

752
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:41,389
- "Yes, so I have spent extra over it.
- What expenses?"

753
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:44,059
It didn't have buttons
so I got buttons on it.

754
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:47,459
And rats had bitten it
so I got it stitched.

755
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:50,329
It was so dirty so I
got it dry cleaned.

756
00:42:50,330 --> 00:42:53,490
"See, brother if you want
it for 4000 then take it."

757
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:08,980
It's strong.

758
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:15,359
5000 rupees?

759
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:18,520
'Hey sir, come here."

760
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:21,629
I gave you my 12 number shoes.

761
00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:23,100
And you gave me 150 rupees.

762
00:43:23,101 --> 00:43:25,699
And he gave you a small pouch
and you gave him 5000 rupees?

763
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:27,099
Why this discrimination?

764
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:30,369
- That was not a pouch of nuts.
- Then what?

765
00:43:30,370 --> 00:43:34,530
That's cocaine. It's the
business of drugs. Drugs.

766
00:43:35,110 --> 00:43:37,940
So should you turn the heroine
bald and sell her in junkyard?

767
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:45,010
'Not bald, heroine, drugs, understood?"

768
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:47,210
- Drugs?
- Yes.

769
00:43:47,390 --> 00:43:51,389
'Hey, you are very naughty."

770
00:43:51,390 --> 00:43:56,020
- Come on give me this suit.
- Take it in 4000 if you want.

771
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,129
You'll get to know when
I inform the police.

772
00:43:59,130 --> 00:44:03,090
The man who gave this item right
now is a policeman himself.

773
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:06,570
Then fine. I will tell
the military people.

774
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:09,570
'Scoundrel, drive slowly."

775
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:17,680
I'll blast that jerk with bomb.
Let me get him once.

776
00:44:17,690 --> 00:44:20,710
Make the 'pani puri' sweet.

777
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:27,590
Give me spicy snack.

778
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:41,600
Catch that jerk!

779
00:44:41,710 --> 00:44:45,610
"He should not run away! You have
fallen in my hands, I won't leave you."

780
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:53,010
Come inside.

781
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:02,620
Look there!

782
00:45:05,730 --> 00:45:10,640
Do one thing. Take this money. Those
men are coming. Give them to drink.

783
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:33,820
I have given my heart out.

784
00:45:34,830 --> 00:45:41,830
I have given my heart out.

785
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:45,509
Love is in the air.

786
00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:47,439
Love is in the eyes.

787
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:51,240
Keep my heart in your
heart carefully.

788
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:58,250
I have given my heart out.

789
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:06,250
I have given my heart out.

790
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:33,689
The walk is quivering.

791
00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:37,759
And even the sight is quivering.

792
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:44,760
My love will make you unaware.

793
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:49,899
There might be many lovers of you.

794
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:53,909
But you will never find one like me.

795
00:46:53,910 --> 00:46:57,909
Why do you hide your eyes
from me like that?

796
00:46:57,910 --> 00:47:01,579
It is difficult for you
to escape from me.

797
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:05,589
My beloved!

798
00:47:05,590 --> 00:47:09,919
Magic is mesmerising.

799
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:13,589
I have given my heart out.
...

800
00:47:13,590 --> 00:47:17,860
Give me my money...

801
00:47:17,870 --> 00:47:19,929
Love is in the air.

802
00:47:19,930 --> 00:47:21,939
Love is in the eyes.

803
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:25,869
Keep my heart in your
heart carefully.

804
00:47:25,870 --> 00:47:32,870
I have given my heart out.

805
00:47:45,290 --> 00:47:47,359
Why don't you guys understand?

806
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:49,699
She is a bar girl in the dance bar.

807
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,898
I myself have shaken a leg
with her. I'm telling you.

808
00:47:51,899 --> 00:47:53,368
She is a girl from a good family.

809
00:47:53,369 --> 00:47:55,168
Nice girl. She can't be a bar dancer.

810
00:47:55,169 --> 00:47:56,968
If you don't believe me then
why don't you come with me?

811
00:47:56,969 --> 00:47:58,368
I don't go to these kinds of places.

812
00:47:58,369 --> 00:48:00,368
- "Babu-bhaiya, you come with me.
- No way. - Come."

813
00:48:00,369 --> 00:48:01,510
I'll not go with him.

814
00:48:01,511 --> 00:48:04,909
First he takes anywhere and
then he gets me into trouble.

815
00:48:04,910 --> 00:48:07,910
You do one thing you go.
You go alone.

816
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:10,378
And if she is in there then pull
her ears and bring her out.

817
00:48:10,379 --> 00:48:12,650
"Hey! Don't pull her ears, Raju.
She is very delicate."

818
00:48:12,651 --> 00:48:14,650
You go.

819
00:48:14,660 --> 00:48:17,589
She took away the whole shop
and you are after her ears.

820
00:48:17,590 --> 00:48:22,150
"What is this? I am feeling
hungry, God."

821
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,830
'Brother, how much is this banana for?"

822
00:48:25,870 --> 00:48:29,669
- 20 rupees a dozen. 20 rupees.
- And without the skin over it?

823
00:48:29,670 --> 00:48:31,830
'Brother, take it if you want."

824
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:36,009
- How much money do you have?
- 5 rupees.

825
00:48:36,010 --> 00:48:41,850
Give it. Give. Take this.

826
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:46,419
- What happened?
- I didn't find her.

827
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:47,688
I had told you that
you won't get her.

828
00:48:47,689 --> 00:48:49,420
Since yesterday the
ladies bar is closed.

829
00:48:49,421 --> 00:48:51,860
The government has kicked
out all the ladies.

830
00:48:52,690 --> 00:48:54,430
"Give me the banana, I am
feeling hungry."

831
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:56,260
What?

832
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:58,769
Spectacled uncle.

833
00:48:58,770 --> 00:49:00,530
What?

834
00:49:00,830 --> 00:49:04,000
I am very hungry. Give me one banana.

835
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:06,439
'Dear, don't cry like this."

836
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:09,439
You are hungry and you
want to eat a banana?

837
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:14,049
Shyam! Give your banana. The
child is feeling hungry.

838
00:49:14,050 --> 00:49:18,210
"Are you a human or something
else? Yes, eat!"

839
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:33,730
- "Uncle, give me one more.
- Take this."

840
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:49,040
'I am still hungry, uncle."

841
00:49:52,750 --> 00:49:56,190
- "Take this also, dear.
- Thank you uncle."

842
00:50:00,090 --> 00:50:02,120
From where did he come from?

843
00:50:02,630 --> 00:50:08,769
You scoundrel! You swindled my money!

844
00:50:08,770 --> 00:50:13,839
Don't hit me with the stone.

845
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:16,000
Look! Look!

846
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:18,509
'I am a gardener, not a rogue."

847
00:50:18,510 --> 00:50:20,850
He has not given back my money.
Beat him! Beat him!

848
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:24,049
"Yes, I am the driver, driver.
He has not given my salary."

849
00:50:24,050 --> 00:50:26,049
Beat him up! Catch him!

850
00:50:26,050 --> 00:50:27,850
"One minute! One minute!
Yes, yes, I know."

851
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:29,518
Don't beat me. I told
you give me a minute.

852
00:50:29,519 --> 00:50:30,790
I don't have the money.

853
00:50:30,791 --> 00:50:33,129
I... I... I had invested that money.

854
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:34,530
That company... let it be...
what can I do...

855
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:36,530
when the company has
eloped with the money?

856
00:50:36,531 --> 00:50:39,999
It is not my fault. That company
eloped with all my money.

857
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:45,539
I am in such a bad state.
And you are asking from me?

858
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:48,809
I beg for food. I feed both of them.

859
00:50:48,810 --> 00:50:52,949
My condition is so bad. You
scoundrels! Have some shame!

860
00:50:52,950 --> 00:50:54,570
Have fear of God!

861
00:50:55,150 --> 00:50:58,219
- "Everything is a loss.
- Yes, everything is a loss."

862
00:50:58,220 --> 00:51:00,450
Not even a single penny is left.

863
00:51:06,090 --> 00:51:10,829
Don't touch my brother. You should
have told me before that...

864
00:51:10,830 --> 00:51:12,829
Only if you people allow me to say.

865
00:51:12,830 --> 00:51:16,899
My boss is so humble.
If you go to him and...

866
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:21,709
tell him about your loss he
will give you 10-20 lakhs more.

867
00:51:21,710 --> 00:51:25,579
There is nothing to
worry about. Do come.

868
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:28,649
Oh God we are saved!

869
00:51:28,650 --> 00:51:30,620
Left turn.

870
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:41,860
'Enough, enough, come, come."

871
00:51:44,870 --> 00:51:46,869
'Hey, hey, slowly, slowly."

872
00:51:46,870 --> 00:51:49,199
'Hey, why is it so dark over here?"

873
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:52,370
After this there is brightness
and only brightness.

874
00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:09,159
"Is this a home or a gun factory?
Greetings, bhabhi-ji."

875
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:11,689
Shut up! What nonsense are you doing?

876
00:52:11,690 --> 00:52:14,890
What do you tease another woman?

877
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:18,330
She is a maid and not a bhabhi.

878
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:28,640
"Sir, sir, sir, these people
are those... those."

879
00:52:32,910 --> 00:52:35,070
'Hey bhai, what are you doing?"

880
00:52:35,650 --> 00:52:38,280
Hey put the gun aside.

881
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:44,090
They have called you inside.

882
00:52:44,930 --> 00:52:47,259
"Come, come, sir. You
are very generous."

883
00:52:47,260 --> 00:52:49,929
Come. All the three of you come.

884
00:52:49,930 --> 00:52:55,739
'Seth-ji, these are those 3 jerks."

885
00:52:55,740 --> 00:52:58,869
'Seth-ji, this jerk fooled me!"

886
00:52:58,870 --> 00:53:01,009
These three people have
swindled your money.

887
00:53:01,010 --> 00:53:03,679
Shoot the three of them and spare me.

888
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:06,209
"Hey, he is lying, he,
he told us that if..."

889
00:53:06,210 --> 00:53:08,949
"...we come to you, you
will give us our money."

890
00:53:08,950 --> 00:53:11,219
He is absolutely lying!

891
00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:18,220
'Quiet, be very quiet, you people..."

892
00:53:18,690 --> 00:53:24,099
have swindled Tiwari sir's
money. I will kill you.

893
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:26,769
"Remove the beetle nut from
your mouth and speak, man."

894
00:53:26,770 --> 00:53:30,130
"He already has a beetle nut
in his mouth, he lisps."

895
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:33,130
'Hey, what are you whispering?"

896
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:35,309
We can't understand
what you are saying.

897
00:53:35,310 --> 00:53:37,309
The thing is that there
is no subtitle below.

898
00:53:37,310 --> 00:53:42,249
Listen! Don't try to act smart.
You're back answering?

899
00:53:42,250 --> 00:53:44,180
You're back answering? I'll blast...

900
00:53:44,181 --> 00:53:46,249
your head and break your nose.

901
00:53:46,250 --> 00:53:49,919
"We people eat Chinese,
we don't understand it."

902
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:52,059
- Give twenty kicks?
- Twenty kicks?

903
00:53:52,060 --> 00:53:55,729
- Give twenty lakhs.
- How will you kick him 20 times?

904
00:53:55,730 --> 00:53:58,729
"Not kicks, I'm saying 20 lakhs,
20 lakhs, hey 20 lakhs."

905
00:53:58,730 --> 00:54:02,339
- It doesn't look good.
- They will beat us. Keep quiet!

906
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:04,939
'Not 20 kicks, 20 lakhs."

907
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:06,739
I will explain. I will explain.

908
00:54:06,740 --> 00:54:10,209
"Oh, God, I'll give it.
Hey, you get ready."

909
00:54:10,210 --> 00:54:12,749
I will remove my slippers
and give you 20 kicks.

910
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:15,010
'Smarty, don't you understand?"

911
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:17,348
What were you saying after
removing the slippers?

912
00:54:17,349 --> 00:54:19,220
I had told you that I'll give
you 20 kicks in the brain.

913
00:54:19,221 --> 00:54:20,749
20 kicks. Give me Tiwari's money.

914
00:54:20,750 --> 00:54:26,759
'One minute, quiet, quiet."

915
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:30,200
You people are blabbering since when.

916
00:54:32,370 --> 00:54:36,670
Give me my money now itself.

917
00:54:36,970 --> 00:54:41,370
Oh God! His master is a bigger
lisper than him as well.

918
00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:43,379
'Hey, shut up, scoundrel, quiet!"

919
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:46,210
Otherwise I'll blow
you with a cannon.

920
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:52,220
Where are my 20 lakh rupees?

921
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:55,719
Where are my 20 lakh rupees?

922
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:57,789
'Okay, okay, the 20 lakh rupees?"

923
00:54:57,790 --> 00:54:59,760
That we already swindled.

924
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:03,550
Are you trying to imitate me?

925
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:06,069
I'll blow you away!

926
00:55:06,070 --> 00:55:11,069
"Hey, hey, I lisp since
the time I was born."

927
00:55:11,070 --> 00:55:13,809
Even my father used to lisp.

928
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:16,809
My grandfather was a singer
in an orchestra.

929
00:55:16,810 --> 00:55:19,809
"What are you saying? Speak
clearly, speak clearly."

930
00:55:19,810 --> 00:55:21,810
He's saying that he used to sing...

931
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:23,819
in the orchestra. He used to sing?

932
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:26,290
"I swear on my mother, I've
seen his father and..."

933
00:55:26,291 --> 00:55:28,419
his grandfather singing over there.

934
00:55:28,420 --> 00:55:30,819
"In the orchestra. I've
seen it, I promise."

935
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:37,820
"My heart keeps on singing,
you are my destination."'

936
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:48,839
You lisp and even I lisp
so we are relatives.

937
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:52,979
"Hey Raju, hey Shyam,
listen carefully."

938
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:56,449
You have swindled the
money of my relative.

939
00:55:56,450 --> 00:56:00,449
"Scoundrels, return it
or else I'll kill you."

940
00:56:00,450 --> 00:56:03,859
I have told them. They will
give you. I'll leave then.

941
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:06,880
'Hey, where do you think you're going?"

942
00:56:10,460 --> 00:56:13,300
Just turn around and see.

943
00:56:23,410 --> 00:56:27,879
- "Hey, where is his head?
- Look on the first floor, brother."

944
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:29,850
Hey my jerks!

945
00:56:30,150 --> 00:56:34,889
Go to their house and get whatever
you can from their house.

946
00:56:34,890 --> 00:56:37,320
"Their briefs, their vests,
get everything."

947
00:56:40,290 --> 00:56:43,320
'Stop, stop, stop!"

948
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:49,439
Why did you stop the car? Do
you stay in this building?

949
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:51,500
"No, no. I don't stay in this
building. I stay in the gutter."

950
00:56:51,510 --> 00:56:52,909
In the gutter?

951
00:56:52,910 --> 00:56:55,509
'I want to urinate urgently, please."

952
00:56:55,510 --> 00:56:56,910
'Come on, go home and do it."

953
00:56:56,911 --> 00:56:58,910
It will leak out at
home then. Let me go.

954
00:56:58,911 --> 00:57:04,350
I will do it in the gutter.
My kidney is spoilt.

955
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:06,919
'Hey Raju, you have a kidney disease?"

956
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:08,589
Why didn't you tell me till today?

957
00:57:08,590 --> 00:57:14,929
"Didn't he tell you, brother? Let
him go, he will do it here only."

958
00:57:14,930 --> 00:57:16,130
His kidney is spoilt.

959
00:57:16,131 --> 00:57:18,929
- What if he runs away?
- Why will I run away? Am I mad?

960
00:57:18,930 --> 00:57:21,399
These two are with you.
I won't run away.

961
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:23,399
'Hey, so will you mortgage us?"

962
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:25,939
'Empty fast and come back, come soon."

963
00:57:25,940 --> 00:57:27,939
'Go, go, go fast Raju, go, go."

964
00:57:27,940 --> 00:57:29,840
He is a very noble human being.

965
00:57:32,210 --> 00:57:33,950
- "Raju, come fast.
- Scoundrel mortgages..."

966
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:36,380
us to go and urinate.

967
00:57:36,950 --> 00:57:39,850
"This kidney disease is
a very bad thing, man."

968
00:57:39,890 --> 00:57:42,959
Have water 10 times
a day. Go 20 times.

969
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:45,720
More than half your life is
spent inside the bathroom.

970
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:50,958
'Hey, why hasn't he returned as yet?"

971
00:57:50,959 --> 00:57:52,228
He must have run away.

972
00:57:52,229 --> 00:57:54,568
I think that his kidney has
suffered from a heart attack.

973
00:57:54,569 --> 00:57:55,668
He must have fallen somewhere.

974
00:57:55,669 --> 00:57:56,919
I'll pick him up and
bring him over here.

975
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:57,968
What if you don't come back?

976
00:57:57,969 --> 00:57:59,110
How will I run away? Why will I run?

977
00:57:59,111 --> 00:58:01,309
Babu-bhaiya is there with
you as a mortgage.

978
00:58:01,310 --> 00:58:03,309
What is this do you
think that I'm the...

979
00:58:03,310 --> 00:58:05,579
'Mangalsutra' of the
neck to mortgage me?

980
00:58:05,580 --> 00:58:07,449
He mortgaged me to go and urinate.

981
00:58:07,450 --> 00:58:08,780
And you are mortgaging
me for heart attack.

982
00:58:08,781 --> 00:58:11,980
"What do you think? He'll
run away, he'll run away."

983
00:58:11,990 --> 00:58:14,680
'Hey, both of you also go with him."

984
00:58:14,990 --> 00:58:18,420
I'll go and get him. Raju!

985
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:24,259
- "Come on!
- Let me go, man."

986
00:58:24,260 --> 00:58:26,599
Bad times have come.

987
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:28,599
First there was heart
attack in the heart.

988
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:31,040
Now heart attack happens
in the kidney as well.

989
00:58:32,010 --> 00:58:35,440
- "Quiet, quiet.
- Okay, fine."

990
00:58:37,540 --> 00:58:40,279
Why haven't these people
come back as yet?

991
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:43,219
"Yes, now it's my turn,
I'll go and see."

992
00:58:43,220 --> 00:58:46,089
"Quiet, do you think I'm mad?
You sit over here."

993
00:58:46,090 --> 00:58:49,450
- Both of us will see and come.
- Yes.

994
00:58:53,030 --> 00:58:56,790
'Hey goons, come here."

995
00:58:59,030 --> 00:59:02,030
Who will lock this car? You shouldn't
leave it open like this.

996
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:03,500
'What if I run away, isn't it?"

997
00:59:03,501 --> 00:59:06,130
- "Okay, okay, fine.
- Yes."

998
00:59:07,970 --> 00:59:12,470
What is this? He has kept
the window open and gone!

999
00:59:17,650 --> 00:59:21,589
- "Babu-bhaiya! Babu.
- Hey, a pickpocket."

1000
00:59:21,590 --> 00:59:23,388
- Why do you shout so much?
- Come fast.

1001
00:59:23,389 --> 00:59:25,060
'No, I cannot come, they have left..."

1002
00:59:25,061 --> 00:59:27,059
the car for me to take care of.

1003
00:59:27,060 --> 00:59:28,590
He will feel bad. I cannot come.

1004
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:30,660
- "Hey man, make him understand.
- Come on, man."

1005
00:59:30,661 --> 00:59:35,330
- "It is locked, how will he come?
- This is how a lock opens."

1006
00:59:35,340 --> 00:59:38,500
Come on.

1007
00:59:43,610 --> 00:59:46,679
"Look, no one should come to
know where we are going."

1008
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:48,080
Otherwise the goons
will come behind us.

1009
00:59:48,081 --> 00:59:50,080
'Now don't worry, I've told everyone..."

1010
00:59:50,081 --> 00:59:52,080
that we aren't going to Kolhapur.

1011
00:59:52,090 --> 00:59:54,089
"Do a thing, you all proceed,
I'll join you."

1012
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:55,619
But where are you going?

1013
00:59:55,620 --> 00:59:58,089
"I have to give Rekha,
Priya and Vimla money."

1014
00:59:58,090 --> 00:59:59,228
That's why I will have to go.

1015
00:59:59,229 --> 01:00:01,160
But from how many women
have you borrowed money?

1016
01:00:01,161 --> 01:00:02,559
Where have I borrowed?

1017
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:04,098
I have borrowed money
from only one girl.

1018
01:00:04,099 --> 01:00:05,360
I have to return her 572 rupees.

1019
01:00:05,370 --> 01:00:07,628
She is a very good girl. She
has a very clear heart.

1020
01:00:07,629 --> 01:00:10,100
I don't want to take her money
and go. I will commit a sin.

1021
01:00:10,101 --> 01:00:12,369
Have you fallen in love or something?

1022
01:00:12,370 --> 01:00:14,109
'No, man, there is no love."

1023
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:16,639
'Yes, no, no, man. I don't trust you."

1024
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:19,109
I never trusted him since
childhood itself.

1025
01:00:19,110 --> 01:00:22,550
Then even you people
come along. Let's go.

1026
01:00:33,130 --> 01:00:34,820
Nobody here.

1027
01:00:35,660 --> 01:00:39,729
"Looks like there are only windows,
there is no door in the building."

1028
01:00:39,730 --> 01:00:42,399
Does that girl come and
go through windows?

1029
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:43,740
This is the backside of the building.

1030
01:00:43,741 --> 01:00:45,400
The main door is ahead.

1031
01:00:45,410 --> 01:00:47,960
And there is not even a
door bell on the window.

1032
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:55,585
Now when the garbage
collector comes then...

1033
01:00:55,586 --> 01:00:57,419
Pappu!

1034
01:00:57,420 --> 01:00:59,150
Father does your father
stay over here?

1035
01:00:59,151 --> 01:01:00,749
'Yes, go and take his blessings."

1036
01:01:00,750 --> 01:01:04,689
- "Do you know Pappu, Pappu?
- What is he doing?"

1037
01:01:04,690 --> 01:01:06,660
What do I know?

1038
01:01:11,630 --> 01:01:13,429
I'm really so dead.

1039
01:01:13,430 --> 01:01:16,600
"Raju, hadn't I told you that
we shouldn't come here?"

1040
01:01:16,770 --> 01:01:19,070
But what is this scoundrel
doing over here?

1041
01:01:21,170 --> 01:01:24,070
'Father, here, take tea."

1042
01:01:26,780 --> 01:01:30,610
'Brother, why have you come here?"

1043
01:01:31,380 --> 01:01:33,790
You've already ruined us this much.
Are you not satisfied yet?

1044
01:01:33,791 --> 01:01:36,459
The trust in which
father was working.

1045
01:01:36,460 --> 01:01:39,620
Over there you forged his signature
and removed all the money.

1046
01:01:39,730 --> 01:01:42,190
But you weren't still satisfied?
You stole my jewellery.

1047
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:44,729
You got the house sold and
today only because of you...

1048
01:01:44,730 --> 01:01:46,799
we have to stay in this rented house.

1049
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:51,669
- "Listen, sister...
- Don't call me sister. Go from here."

1050
01:01:51,670 --> 01:01:53,669
Don't steal the little peace that is...

1051
01:01:53,670 --> 01:01:55,670
left in the last days of our lives.

1052
01:01:55,680 --> 01:02:00,209
"Don't open this door, they will
kill me. They won't spare me."

1053
01:02:00,210 --> 01:02:04,819
- What? Which people?
- They are very dangerous people.

1054
01:02:04,820 --> 01:02:06,219
What?
...

1055
01:02:06,220 --> 01:02:07,980
They will take my life.

1056
01:02:11,220 --> 01:02:14,629
I had 20 lakh rupees that
belonged to Tiwari.

1057
01:02:14,630 --> 01:02:16,229
Someone told me about a scheme...

1058
01:02:16,230 --> 01:02:18,250
about doubling your money in 25 days.

1059
01:02:18,770 --> 01:02:21,830
I thought that I'll double it
and settle all your debts.

1060
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:25,670
But my luck itself was bad.

1061
01:02:25,710 --> 01:02:28,239
The people whom I gave 20 lakh rupees.

1062
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:30,239
They cheated me and ran
away with the money.

1063
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:33,849
"They left me and went. Sister,
Tiwari won't spare me."

1064
01:02:33,850 --> 01:02:39,449
Open the door. Open the door.

1065
01:02:39,450 --> 01:02:42,010
Don't open the door. You go inside.

1066
01:02:48,860 --> 01:02:52,020
- "Hey, where were you hiding?
- I have worked with you."

1067
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:57,700
You are like my buddies. Don't
do anything to my sister.

1068
01:03:09,750 --> 01:03:15,380
Oh God! What is this?
Where did they go?

1069
01:03:16,290 --> 01:03:22,730
"You scoundrels, wait!
Wait! Stop the car."

1070
01:03:48,390 --> 01:03:50,389
- "Raju, give me your hand.
- Take this."

1071
01:03:50,390 --> 01:03:52,760
There is a gutter below. Be careful.

1072
01:03:55,600 --> 01:04:02,600
"Oh God, because of us even
she got in trouble."

1073
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:05,770
We'll have to take something
to eat in the train.

1074
01:04:05,940 --> 01:04:08,300
Even her father is handicapped.

1075
01:04:08,540 --> 01:04:10,770
What have we done?

1076
01:04:10,940 --> 01:04:12,809
We even need bottles to drink.

1077
01:04:12,810 --> 01:04:16,770
"Yes, whatever happened
it wasn't right."

1078
01:04:17,420 --> 01:04:18,880
Come on quickly! We
will miss the train.

1079
01:04:18,890 --> 01:04:23,790
"Shut up, scoundrel, are you
a human or a drainage?"

1080
01:04:24,620 --> 01:04:28,359
That poor girl was picked up by
those goons and this scoundrel...

1081
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:31,060
wants to hide his face and run away.

1082
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:33,699
'I'm not going anywhere, I'm here only."

1083
01:04:33,700 --> 01:04:36,130
I was talking about the
both of you leaving.

1084
01:04:41,910 --> 01:04:44,909
"Hey, Raju! Hey Raju,
what are you saying?"

1085
01:04:44,910 --> 01:04:48,649
"I was the one who gambled, and
the girl was put on stake."

1086
01:04:48,650 --> 01:04:50,950
I got even you people on the streets.

1087
01:04:50,980 --> 01:04:52,989
Now I have to do what has to be done.

1088
01:04:52,990 --> 01:04:55,088
You both go and catch the train there
is a lot of danger over here.

1089
01:04:55,089 --> 01:04:55,990
What will you do?

1090
01:04:55,991 --> 01:04:58,659
"Nothing, I'll go there
to that lisping Tiwari."

1091
01:04:58,660 --> 01:05:01,389
I will tell him to leave the
girl in exchange for me.

1092
01:05:01,390 --> 01:05:04,659
"That lisping Tiwari is crazy,
he'll kill you."

1093
01:05:04,660 --> 01:05:09,399
"Let him kill me. He'll
finish me, at least..."

1094
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:13,840
the burden of this
sin will be off me.

1095
01:05:14,940 --> 01:05:19,100
I'll go to him and I will beg
of him to leave the girl.

1096
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:21,809
Hey Raju!

1097
01:05:21,810 --> 01:05:26,889
"Hey Raju, you jerk, have you
seen this face of yours?"

1098
01:05:26,890 --> 01:05:28,819
Who will give you any alms?

1099
01:05:28,820 --> 01:05:33,029
"Here, look at me. Look, I look
like a ready made beggar."

1100
01:05:33,030 --> 01:05:35,690
"I'll have to come with you.
Come on, let's go."

1101
01:05:35,700 --> 01:05:37,990
I've been asking since
the time I was born.

1102
01:05:38,570 --> 01:05:43,039
"First, parents' love,
then a scholarship..."

1103
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:45,530
to study and now job.

1104
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:49,200
My asking bio-data is
very good. I'm a PhD.

1105
01:05:49,380 --> 01:05:51,040
"Even I'll have to come,
right? Come on."

1106
01:05:51,041 --> 01:05:54,979
"No, I was the one who
wanted to be rich."

1107
01:05:54,980 --> 01:05:57,450
When the sin is mine why should
both of you suffer?

1108
01:05:57,451 --> 01:06:00,849
'Shut up, man! What sin, sin, sin?"

1109
01:06:00,850 --> 01:06:03,789
"See, when you were building
your bundle..."

1110
01:06:03,790 --> 01:06:07,059
of sins even I put my little
pouch of greed in it.

1111
01:06:07,060 --> 01:06:10,729
- But Babu-bhaiya...
- What are you trying to say?

1112
01:06:10,730 --> 01:06:13,560
If you speak too much I'll
give you one tight slap.

1113
01:06:14,070 --> 01:06:16,430
Babu-bhaiya he is a very cunning man.

1114
01:06:17,470 --> 01:06:20,069
Firstly he forcefully
involves in his sin.

1115
01:06:20,070 --> 01:06:21,810
And then while the time
to pay for it...

1116
01:06:21,811 --> 01:06:24,079
"...came, you walked away
alone, what is this?"

1117
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:27,809
"See, whether it is to have fun
or to undergo punishment."

1118
01:06:27,810 --> 01:06:30,549
All three of us must have
an equal share in it.

1119
01:06:30,550 --> 01:06:32,480
If Raju takes two spankings then...

1120
01:06:32,490 --> 01:06:34,090
even Shyam will take two spankings.

1121
01:06:34,091 --> 01:06:36,489
And if even Shyam takes
two spankings then...

1122
01:06:36,490 --> 01:06:40,250
"...even I'll have to take
a spanking, won't I?"

1123
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:45,500
'Come on, let's go to the don and..."

1124
01:06:45,501 --> 01:06:48,930
seek a loan of pity
from him. Come on!

1125
01:07:12,930 --> 01:07:17,490
"What man, you were saying
that they ran away."

1126
01:07:18,930 --> 01:07:23,090
This matter is between us.
Leave that poor girl.

1127
01:07:24,140 --> 01:07:26,809
If you want you can
keep me as mortgage.

1128
01:07:26,810 --> 01:07:28,539
But please leave his sister.

1129
01:07:28,540 --> 01:07:32,540
"Very well, then who will
give me my money?"

1130
01:07:32,550 --> 01:07:33,808
'Yes, I'll give it."

1131
01:07:33,809 --> 01:07:35,150
I'll give you your 20 lakh rupees.

1132
01:07:35,151 --> 01:07:38,019
- 40 lakhs.
- Why 40 lakhs?

1133
01:07:38,020 --> 01:07:40,819
Why? Weren't you going to double it?

1134
01:07:40,820 --> 01:07:44,819
40 lakhs and that too in 3 days.

1135
01:07:44,820 --> 01:07:48,559
"3 days, oh my God, that
is very less time."

1136
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:51,099
We'll need at least 30 years time.

1137
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:53,000
'Babu, Babu-bhaiya..."

1138
01:07:54,100 --> 01:07:58,169
"Okay, I'll give you 40 lakh
rupees in three days."

1139
01:07:58,170 --> 01:08:01,839
What proof do I have that
you won't run away?

1140
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:06,179
"Brother, if we really had to
run would we come to you?"

1141
01:08:06,180 --> 01:08:08,109
Please leave his sister.

1142
01:08:08,110 --> 01:08:14,350
"Fine, Pappu while you are going
take your sister along with you."

1143
01:08:22,860 --> 01:08:24,729
Open the lock...

1144
01:08:24,730 --> 01:08:27,599
That lock... I don't have
the keys to that lock.

1145
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:30,300
Shut up! I am not telling
you. I am telling him.

1146
01:08:32,940 --> 01:08:35,570
'The scoundrel, he broke it."

1147
01:08:45,150 --> 01:08:49,089
"Which toothpaste do
you use? This, this..."

1148
01:08:49,090 --> 01:08:52,620
old lock of my trunk isn't
opening. Open it for me.

1149
01:08:52,630 --> 01:08:54,180
Keep quiet.

1150
01:08:54,890 --> 01:08:59,899
If you ever go to the police station
or run away then I'll not spare you!

1151
01:08:59,900 --> 01:09:02,029
I'll come to take the
money after 3 days.

1152
01:09:02,030 --> 01:09:05,660
If there is no money then even
your time will be over.

1153
01:09:20,850 --> 01:09:23,340
- "Peter.
- Tell me, Nanji-bhai."

1154
01:09:23,860 --> 01:09:25,319
I trust you so much...

1155
01:09:25,320 --> 01:09:27,690
So much so that you don't
even trust your wife.

1156
01:09:27,790 --> 01:09:30,659
You are right. The faith
was so much a year...

1157
01:09:30,660 --> 01:09:32,660
back as the faith I have in you...

1158
01:09:32,670 --> 01:09:34,330
'The faith, which you had in Munna?"

1159
01:09:34,331 --> 01:09:36,199
But he was a betrayer.

1160
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:40,100
Don't worry Nanji-bhai.
I am like a honest dog.

1161
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:46,679
That is why I have got you
here to show you my den.

1162
01:09:46,680 --> 01:09:48,370
Look at this.

1163
01:09:51,220 --> 01:09:52,880
There is a den in the police station?

1164
01:09:52,890 --> 01:09:55,950
"Not in the police station,
on its terrace."

1165
01:09:55,960 --> 01:09:59,120
Go up and get the money.

1166
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:07,699
Hey Gotya! Nanji-bhai's
new man has come.

1167
01:10:07,700 --> 01:10:10,130
We have to give him the
goods and the money.

1168
01:10:12,040 --> 01:10:15,709
Take this. This is the stuff...

1169
01:10:15,710 --> 01:10:19,140
and this is the money. Be careful!

1170
01:10:33,730 --> 01:10:35,329
Don't you feel ashamed?

1171
01:10:35,330 --> 01:10:39,700
The time has come to commit
suicide because of you.

1172
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,729
From where will you get it?

1173
01:10:41,730 --> 01:10:46,000
From where will you get the money
to give that lisp fatso?

1174
01:10:46,010 --> 01:10:52,809
I am your culprit. Now there
is only one way left for me.

1175
01:10:52,810 --> 01:10:54,749
So will you sell my loincloth?

1176
01:10:54,750 --> 01:10:57,440
Every person has two kidneys.

1177
01:10:58,750 --> 01:11:00,349
So?

1178
01:11:00,350 --> 01:11:04,190
But a person can live
with a single kidney.

1179
01:11:06,290 --> 01:11:08,190
'What are you saying, dear?"

1180
01:11:10,030 --> 01:11:14,369
I will sell one of the kidney to a
rich patient.

1181
01:11:14,370 --> 01:11:16,800
I will get a lot of money.

1182
01:11:17,370 --> 01:11:22,200
Then I will sell one eye.
And I will get some money.

1183
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:26,270
Then one more kidney and
one more eye.

1184
01:11:27,250 --> 01:11:30,270
And in this way I will
sell the entire body.

1185
01:11:31,180 --> 01:11:33,789
I will repay Tiwari's
loan from this money...

1186
01:11:33,790 --> 01:11:36,220
and I will pay the price for my sins.

1187
01:11:38,790 --> 01:11:43,799
Oh dear! Oh dear! Oh God!
I thought you...

1188
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:48,069
were a crook but you have
shown yourself to be a God.

1189
01:11:48,070 --> 01:11:54,209
You are God. You will sell your
kidney for Baburao? And your eye?

1190
01:11:54,210 --> 01:11:56,809
Oh God! You are a God sent person.

1191
01:11:56,810 --> 01:11:58,879
I am not talking of my kidney.

1192
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:01,149
I am talking about your
kidney and eyes.

1193
01:12:01,150 --> 01:12:05,279
What me? You scoundrel!

1194
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:08,149
"Babu-bhaiya, don't leave him.
He is a scoundrel."

1195
01:12:08,150 --> 01:12:11,089
Will you hit me? You will
take out my eyes!

1196
01:12:11,090 --> 01:12:12,820
- You will sell my kidney!
- No! No! - No!

1197
01:12:12,830 --> 01:12:15,089
- Babu-bhaiya!
- I respect you so much!

1198
01:12:15,090 --> 01:12:18,260
Babu-bhaiya a murder
is going to happen!

1199
01:12:21,900 --> 01:12:24,530
It is a tomato! Tomato!

1200
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:25,969
You scoundrel!

1201
01:12:25,970 --> 01:12:27,109
No! No! No!

1202
01:12:27,110 --> 01:12:28,840
"Babu-bhaiya, Babu-bhaiya,
leave this madness."

1203
01:12:28,841 --> 01:12:33,109
I won't spare that scoundrel!

1204
01:12:33,110 --> 01:12:36,849
Babu-bhaiya just cool down.
Just cool down that's it.

1205
01:12:36,850 --> 01:12:41,620
"You are scaring me with a tomato,
you scoundrel."

1206
01:12:45,390 --> 01:12:47,859
I'll cut him like a tomato
and radish!

1207
01:12:47,860 --> 01:12:50,399
You keep calm. Why are you
increasing your blood pressure?

1208
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:56,399
I feel like the mother in Mother
India. She shoots her child.

1209
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:59,869
In the same way I will become
father India and shoot Raju.

1210
01:12:59,870 --> 01:13:02,310
Keep that gun down. Just cool down.

1211
01:13:03,410 --> 01:13:05,310
Excuse me!

1212
01:13:10,150 --> 01:13:13,580
- "Who is he, dear?
- I do not know."

1213
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:22,490
'Yes, I am Devdas, Paro."

1214
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:24,499
'Not Paro, I am Peter."

1215
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:27,899
I had sent you as a king to Nanji...

1216
01:13:27,900 --> 01:13:30,899
and you came back as a queen!

1217
01:13:30,900 --> 01:13:34,439
Do you know how much danger
there is in coming here?

1218
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:36,208
If the people of Nanji-bhai
know that I have come here.

1219
01:13:36,209 --> 01:13:37,308
They will kill me.

1220
01:13:37,309 --> 01:13:38,908
"After escaping from Nanji-bhai,
have you..."

1221
01:13:38,909 --> 01:13:40,050
come here to pass your time?

1222
01:13:40,051 --> 01:13:43,340
We have come to know of
Nanji-bhai's treasure.

1223
01:13:44,180 --> 01:13:49,350
Now the real fun will start. Now
Nanji-bhai will be doomed.

1224
01:13:49,460 --> 01:13:52,920
Where are the goods? Come
with me. Tell me.

1225
01:13:52,930 --> 01:13:54,929
There is one terrace flat
in the building...

1226
01:13:54,930 --> 01:13:56,390
which is above the Khetwadi
police station.

1227
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:58,199
I saw it with my own eyes.

1228
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:02,469
They have stuffed crores
of money in the shoebox.

1229
01:14:02,470 --> 01:14:05,539
Those 2 bags must be having
at least 34 crores.

1230
01:14:05,540 --> 01:14:09,070
Great! Tomorrow afternoon crores...

1231
01:14:09,080 --> 01:14:13,009
of rupees will be here from there.

1232
01:14:13,010 --> 01:14:18,549
"And after that you will be a bigger
boss than Nanji-bhai, bhai."

1233
01:14:18,550 --> 01:14:21,219
'You are great, bhai! You are great!"

1234
01:14:21,220 --> 01:14:26,220
Kanji! Who is the person who made
Nanji the man he is today?

1235
01:14:26,230 --> 01:14:28,959
Sir! Sir! Don't forget my 50 %.

1236
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:31,029
Now you are sure to get 50 %.

1237
01:14:31,030 --> 01:14:34,400
My 50 % and the rest will
be for the children.

1238
01:14:36,500 --> 01:14:39,969
Nanji has come out
of his burrow hole.

1239
01:14:39,970 --> 01:14:42,570
Munna-bhai started dancing.

1240
01:14:42,580 --> 01:14:44,979
Nanji has come out
of his burrow hole.

1241
01:14:44,980 --> 01:14:46,979
Munna-bhai started dancing.

1242
01:14:46,980 --> 01:14:49,470
"Bhai, I think that this
girl is whistling."

1243
01:14:49,980 --> 01:14:52,519
We have been drinking and
you are intoxicated.

1244
01:14:52,520 --> 01:14:55,189
"Since you are wearing this dress,
she is just whistling."

1245
01:14:55,190 --> 01:14:58,420
"If you don't remove it, she
will hit you with a broom."

1246
01:14:59,590 --> 01:15:02,329
Its empty. Its empty now.

1247
01:15:02,330 --> 01:15:04,999
'Babu-bhaiya, come with me."

1248
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:06,529
I do not want to sell my kidney.

1249
01:15:06,530 --> 01:15:08,000
I do not want to sell your kidney.

1250
01:15:08,001 --> 01:15:10,000
"No, I do not want to
sell my eyes also."

1251
01:15:10,001 --> 01:15:11,999
I want to tell you some secret.

1252
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,440
We don't want to listen.

1253
01:15:15,540 --> 01:15:17,079
Come!

1254
01:15:17,080 --> 01:15:19,609
I have just listened to a top secret.

1255
01:15:19,610 --> 01:15:21,078
Which radio did you listen to?

1256
01:15:21,079 --> 01:15:23,010
"Not on the radio. Our neighbor,
Munna."

1257
01:15:23,020 --> 01:15:24,619
That loincloth thief!

1258
01:15:24,620 --> 01:15:27,619
He is not a petty thief.
He is a mastermind!

1259
01:15:27,620 --> 01:15:30,419
I have heard it with my eyes and ears.

1260
01:15:30,420 --> 01:15:33,989
They were planning. They were
planning to rob 4-5 crores.

1261
01:15:33,990 --> 01:15:35,358
After robbing the money
they were going...

1262
01:15:35,359 --> 01:15:36,490
to bring it in our neighboring room.

1263
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:39,730
So go and tell it in the police
station. Why have you got us here?

1264
01:15:40,030 --> 01:15:44,039
I have a great plan. When
Munna and his men...

1265
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:47,039
leave their house for the robbery.

1266
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:49,970
We will sneak into his house and
sit there in guise in the room.

1267
01:15:49,980 --> 01:15:51,440
And when they return with the money.

1268
01:15:51,441 --> 01:15:56,049
We will put a gun to their head
and leave with the money.

1269
01:15:56,050 --> 01:15:58,519
How much have we to
give to that Tiwari?

1270
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:01,049
We have to give 40 lakhs.
If we remove 40 lakhs...

1271
01:16:01,050 --> 01:16:02,390
"...from 4 crores, how much will
be left?"

1272
01:16:02,391 --> 01:16:03,659
Three sixty.

1273
01:16:03,660 --> 01:16:07,329
You remember the accounts
well. Three sixty.

1274
01:16:07,330 --> 01:16:11,059
We will share the three
sixty between three...

1275
01:16:11,060 --> 01:16:13,599
of us and we will leave this city.

1276
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:17,830
We will leave this place.
And we will have fun.

1277
01:16:19,070 --> 01:16:21,069
We will have money and money.

1278
01:16:21,070 --> 01:16:22,609
This is a great plan.

1279
01:16:22,610 --> 01:16:26,079
What great plan is it?
It is sheer nonsense.

1280
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:28,078
He has bought us onto the roads
now he will send us to jail?

1281
01:16:28,079 --> 01:16:29,210
Is it to break the stones?

1282
01:16:29,220 --> 01:16:31,078
"Babu-bhaiya, don't be
trapped by his talks."

1283
01:16:31,079 --> 01:16:32,680
He is once again trying to fool us.

1284
01:16:32,690 --> 01:16:35,089
We are already in a rut.
When those people...

1285
01:16:35,090 --> 01:16:37,358
ask for 40 lakhs form where
will we give them 40 lakhs.

1286
01:16:37,359 --> 01:16:39,088
"Babu-bhaiya, when that
black bull and..."

1287
01:16:39,089 --> 01:16:40,428
that Kutub Minar come
asking for money...

1288
01:16:40,429 --> 01:16:41,690
what will we give them?

1289
01:16:41,691 --> 01:16:44,629
"If Anjali asks, what answer will you
give? Will you commit suicide?"

1290
01:16:44,630 --> 01:16:46,160
I will murder you.

1291
01:16:46,170 --> 01:16:48,098
I tell you Babu-bhaiya throw this
root cause of commotion...

1292
01:16:48,099 --> 01:16:49,700
and the root cause of our
troubles down from here.

1293
01:16:49,701 --> 01:16:54,140
'Yes, throw me. Throw me down."

1294
01:16:56,310 --> 01:16:58,509
You will also not live
after killing me.

1295
01:16:58,510 --> 01:17:00,110
You are mature enough. Please
make him understand.

1296
01:17:00,111 --> 01:17:01,609
'I understand, dear."

1297
01:17:01,610 --> 01:17:03,310
What do you understand?

1298
01:17:03,320 --> 01:17:06,719
Understand clearly that he is
asking us to do a robbery.

1299
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:08,188
Then he will tell us tomorrow
to kill them.

1300
01:17:08,189 --> 01:17:09,450
"- Yes, correct!"

1301
01:17:09,460 --> 01:17:12,720
What correct is it? Am I telling
you to rob from the temple?

1302
01:17:12,730 --> 01:17:14,728
I am telling you to steal
from that thief's house.

1303
01:17:14,729 --> 01:17:16,130
I am not telling you to kill him.

1304
01:17:16,131 --> 01:17:19,399
"You understood, Shyam. He is
not asking us to kill anyone."

1305
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:21,128
'Babu-bhaiya, this is the wrong path."

1306
01:17:21,129 --> 01:17:22,730
- This is the right path.
- This is the wrong way.

1307
01:17:22,740 --> 01:17:24,138
I am telling you this
is the only right path.

1308
01:17:24,139 --> 01:17:25,470
"No, this is the wrong
path, Babu-bhaiya."

1309
01:17:25,471 --> 01:17:28,409
'Babu-bhaiya, this the right path."

1310
01:17:28,410 --> 01:17:30,170
Shut up!

1311
01:17:38,350 --> 01:17:41,180
Do you have any other way?

1312
01:17:49,090 --> 01:17:51,590
Where will you get the gun from?

1313
01:18:01,710 --> 01:18:05,509
Don't worry about that! I will
arrange for everything.

1314
01:18:05,510 --> 01:18:10,579
"Seth-ji, the guns that are there in
this book, 15 guns are with a Parsi."

1315
01:18:10,580 --> 01:18:13,419
And even those 3 special guns
which are worth crores...

1316
01:18:13,420 --> 01:18:15,510
in the international market...

1317
01:18:27,530 --> 01:18:29,470
'Thank you, Seth-ji."

1318
01:18:31,740 --> 01:18:35,439
"Seth-ji, I am telling
you not to leave..."

1319
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:39,449
him till we get the money?
What do you say?

1320
01:18:39,450 --> 01:18:44,980
That is okay but did you find
out about that Parsi's guns?

1321
01:18:44,990 --> 01:18:48,189
"Boss that Parsi is in Mumbai,
and all the..."

1322
01:18:48,190 --> 01:18:52,489
"...fifteen guns are with him,
but nobody knows where he is."

1323
01:18:52,490 --> 01:18:57,829
Search him. I can see him in my
dream. I can see those guns.

1324
01:18:57,830 --> 01:19:02,290
Parsi and the guns?

1325
01:19:03,100 --> 01:19:07,109
Boss if I get you those fifteen
guns from Parsi then?

1326
01:19:07,110 --> 01:19:08,709
From where will you bring it?

1327
01:19:08,710 --> 01:19:12,849
Sir that is my responsibility.
You only give me 2 days time.

1328
01:19:12,850 --> 01:19:14,479
I will bring and give it to you.

1329
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:20,940
Fine. If you get me those 15
guns then I will free you.

1330
01:19:24,060 --> 01:19:30,460
- Parsi is sleeping in his bungalow.
- We should wake him up.

1331
01:19:31,630 --> 01:19:35,699
He has 15 guns with him.

1332
01:19:35,700 --> 01:19:39,539
We have to get them quickly.

1333
01:19:39,540 --> 01:19:41,400
Will it be done?

1334
01:19:51,890 --> 01:19:53,889
Remove the chloroform quickly.

1335
01:19:53,890 --> 01:19:55,680
Put it soon.

1336
01:19:55,860 --> 01:19:56,989
And?

1337
01:19:56,990 --> 01:20:02,520
'One minute, come on."

1338
01:20:05,470 --> 01:20:08,090
Who is there? What are you doing?

1339
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:25,849
Seventeen.

1340
01:20:25,850 --> 01:20:28,550
What are you talking? 17?
And these 3 will be twenty.

1341
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:30,759
But Pappu said that there
are only fifteen.

1342
01:20:30,760 --> 01:20:36,559
Instead of 15 we will take
2 extra. He will be happy.

1343
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:37,699
And listen...

1344
01:20:37,700 --> 01:20:39,869
The rest of the three are
left we will sell it.

1345
01:20:39,870 --> 01:20:43,069
"What fifty, fifty? But don't
tell Pappu about it."

1346
01:20:43,070 --> 01:20:44,200
I will not tell him.

1347
01:20:44,201 --> 01:20:47,569
"Idiot, where are the
other three guns?"

1348
01:20:47,570 --> 01:20:49,179
Which three guns?

1349
01:20:49,180 --> 01:20:51,309
You asked for 15 I got 17.

1350
01:20:51,310 --> 01:20:53,579
These three guns!

1351
01:20:53,580 --> 01:20:54,710
These three guns. Their value is...

1352
01:20:54,720 --> 01:20:56,580
crores of rupees in
the international...

1353
01:20:56,581 --> 01:20:59,249
"...market. Where is it,
tell me? Where is it?"

1354
01:20:59,250 --> 01:21:01,020
"I will show you, where
is it? Tell me."

1355
01:21:01,021 --> 01:21:05,550
"Boss, I will bring it. I will
bring it sir. I will bring it."

1356
01:21:05,860 --> 01:21:08,029
One and one eleven.

1357
01:21:08,030 --> 01:21:10,199
"Teacher is mad, you should
not listen to him."

1358
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:12,100
Where are the guns?

1359
01:21:14,530 --> 01:21:17,599
This is what happens when
you go to school.

1360
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:20,339
You yourself have the guns and
you are asking me about it.

1361
01:21:20,340 --> 01:21:21,610
"Don't try to act smart,
I will push..."

1362
01:21:21,611 --> 01:21:25,040
all three bullets into your stomach.

1363
01:21:25,050 --> 01:21:27,179
Where are the three big guns?

1364
01:21:27,180 --> 01:21:30,119
Those I have sold it.

1365
01:21:30,120 --> 01:21:32,310
'What, you sold them?"

1366
01:21:33,850 --> 01:21:37,559
Who asked you sell those 3 guns?

1367
01:21:37,560 --> 01:21:41,629
I will pay you how much money you
want. I will pay you double and...

1368
01:21:41,630 --> 01:21:46,369
"...triple, if you want, but whom did
you sell those guns to, tell me?"

1369
01:21:46,370 --> 01:21:49,169
How am I to know where he stays?

1370
01:21:49,170 --> 01:21:53,800
A small angel has come to my house.

1371
01:21:54,740 --> 01:21:57,279
Raju these are real or fake?

1372
01:21:57,280 --> 01:21:59,150
- They are real.
- What are you saying?

1373
01:21:59,151 --> 01:22:03,080
"- Are there bullets in it?
- Yes, but they are deep inside."

1374
01:22:05,820 --> 01:22:07,319
Did it fall?

1375
01:22:07,320 --> 01:22:09,259
Leave it. Nothing has fallen.

1376
01:22:09,260 --> 01:22:12,689
If anything has fallen I will
throw it and hit you.

1377
01:22:12,690 --> 01:22:16,599
Whatever it is. These guns
will change our fate.

1378
01:22:16,600 --> 01:22:23,600
"Oh I am very scared. Oh God,
robbery in a thief's house."

1379
01:22:24,670 --> 01:22:26,170
Again there would be a con game.

1380
01:22:39,090 --> 01:22:43,020
"So much time has passed, but
why is he taking so long?"

1381
01:22:43,190 --> 01:22:45,089
Police?

1382
01:22:45,090 --> 01:22:46,220
Police comes everyday.

1383
01:22:46,230 --> 01:22:48,530
This is not that police. It seems
they are from a special branch.

1384
01:22:48,531 --> 01:22:50,360
Run from here...

1385
01:22:51,860 --> 01:22:54,198
- Now what will happen?
- Police has raided the place.

1386
01:22:54,199 --> 01:22:56,570
You people go to your villages. I
will take care of everything here.

1387
01:22:56,571 --> 01:22:58,439
But Naan... Nanji-bhai. -.

1388
01:22:58,440 --> 01:22:59,940
I will take care of
Nanji-bhai also. You run away

1389
01:22:59,941 --> 01:23:02,570
Police are coming from that side.

1390
01:23:02,580 --> 01:23:06,700
'Go from the back way. Go, go."

1391
01:23:11,950 --> 01:23:14,949
"Sir, the police station
is this way..."

1392
01:23:14,950 --> 01:23:18,010
why are you going that
way? Which section?

1393
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:23,559
- Which section? I am not the police.
- Then?

1394
01:23:23,560 --> 01:23:25,830
I am the CID.

1395
01:23:26,170 --> 01:23:30,039
"Then sir, why have you worn the
uniform of the police officer?"

1396
01:23:30,040 --> 01:23:31,970
"Actually the thing is,
in casual clothes..."

1397
01:23:31,971 --> 01:23:34,309
people doubt that I am from the CID.

1398
01:23:34,310 --> 01:23:36,370
But if I wear the uniform
of the police.

1399
01:23:36,380 --> 01:23:38,479
Then nobody will doubt
that I am from the CID.

1400
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:41,979
'Wow, what an idea!"

1401
01:23:41,980 --> 01:23:43,550
'What are you clapping for, salute."

1402
01:23:43,551 --> 01:23:44,649
Sir!

1403
01:23:44,650 --> 01:23:49,420
Shut up! Hands up. No one will move.

1404
01:23:49,960 --> 01:23:52,620
"Nobody is here, everything
is clear now."

1405
01:23:52,630 --> 01:23:54,290
I told them that the
police have come.

1406
01:23:54,291 --> 01:23:55,389
Hey police.

1407
01:23:55,390 --> 01:23:56,660
You are the police.

1408
01:23:56,661 --> 01:24:00,529
"You just scared me,
where is the money?"

1409
01:24:00,530 --> 01:24:02,699
Nanji-bhai took the money yesterday.

1410
01:24:02,700 --> 01:24:06,000
But the goods that is inside
is not less than money.

1411
01:24:06,010 --> 01:24:08,139
There must be at least
three or four crores.

1412
01:24:08,140 --> 01:24:11,870
- Where is it? - The full bag is full.
- Where is it? - Inside.

1413
01:24:14,710 --> 01:24:17,019
Here is the crate.
Must be at least...

1414
01:24:17,020 --> 01:24:19,450
worth of three or four crores.

1415
01:24:20,020 --> 01:24:23,450
See I have even got 2 bags ready.

1416
01:24:23,590 --> 01:24:27,289
Now I will teach Nanji-bhai
a lesson.

1417
01:24:27,290 --> 01:24:30,029
Now no one can stop me from
becoming a gang lord.

1418
01:24:30,030 --> 01:24:35,129
I have become a gang lord.

1419
01:24:35,130 --> 01:24:37,040
I cannot find peace
anymore without you.

1420
01:24:37,041 --> 01:24:39,200
I cannot sleep anymore without you.

1421
01:24:49,050 --> 01:24:55,580
This is good. I got a joker's
dress from Mohini theatre box.

1422
01:24:58,120 --> 01:25:00,659
'Come, come, let's go."

1423
01:25:00,660 --> 01:25:03,130
You people hide here quietly.

1424
01:25:03,430 --> 01:25:06,060
'We have to hide, okay done."

1425
01:25:06,070 --> 01:25:07,669
Where are you going?

1426
01:25:07,670 --> 01:25:10,439
We should hide in our own house.

1427
01:25:10,440 --> 01:25:12,500
"Nobody will know about
it, isn't it Raju?"

1428
01:25:12,510 --> 01:25:15,409
- Shut up! Don't take names!
- You understand?

1429
01:25:15,410 --> 01:25:18,739
"Raju is right, we should
not take anyone's names"

1430
01:25:18,740 --> 01:25:20,809
Why are you taking names? Hide! Hide!

1431
01:25:20,810 --> 01:25:22,870
Now all of you go and hide.

1432
01:25:36,060 --> 01:25:37,699
What are you doing?

1433
01:25:37,700 --> 01:25:39,329
'You said to hide, right?"

1434
01:25:39,330 --> 01:25:42,099
Don't hide behind me. Go
and hide somewhere there.

1435
01:25:42,100 --> 01:25:47,540
"Come on, be quick! We must do our
work and no one should come to know."

1436
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:52,179
Police... police!

1437
01:25:52,180 --> 01:25:59,180
- Oh no! It is the police.
- Police? But in a clown's dress?

1438
01:26:01,390 --> 01:26:06,059
- He is the neighbor.
- He is that loincloth thief!

1439
01:26:06,060 --> 01:26:07,490
Why are we scared so much?

1440
01:26:07,491 --> 01:26:10,129
We are the genuine police.

1441
01:26:10,130 --> 01:26:12,560
It seems they are the police who spy.

1442
01:26:12,630 --> 01:26:14,599
Are you from the CBI?

1443
01:26:14,600 --> 01:26:17,139
- SRP!
- SRP!

1444
01:26:17,140 --> 01:26:18,569
SRP means?

1445
01:26:18,570 --> 01:26:20,770
They are from the special
branch. You don't know?

1446
01:26:20,771 --> 01:26:23,139
'Bhai, your knowledge is very good."

1447
01:26:23,140 --> 01:26:25,439
No one will press anyone's legs.

1448
01:26:25,440 --> 01:26:30,849
Push the bag behind. Fast!
And now raise your hands.

1449
01:26:30,850 --> 01:26:34,489
'Joker S. Shyam, yes. You."

1450
01:26:34,490 --> 01:26:35,650
Bring a rope.

1451
01:26:35,660 --> 01:26:36,859
Joker B!

1452
01:26:36,860 --> 01:26:38,159
Bring a rope.

1453
01:26:38,160 --> 01:26:43,399
"The rope, I have forgotten
that, Raju."

1454
01:26:43,400 --> 01:26:45,630
'Fool, you forgot the rope."

1455
01:26:46,130 --> 01:26:48,599
B categories C class people.

1456
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:50,169
Bring me a rope from somewhere.

1457
01:26:50,170 --> 01:26:52,300
"Joker R, will the string
of my pyjama do?"

1458
01:26:52,310 --> 01:26:53,439
No.

1459
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:56,709
- Do you have a rope?
- Rope?

1460
01:26:56,710 --> 01:26:59,179
Actually I forgot it in haste.

1461
01:26:59,180 --> 01:27:03,749
I have the rope. But
it is in Bandra.

1462
01:27:03,750 --> 01:27:08,189
- "If you want, shall I go and get it?
- From Bandra?"

1463
01:27:08,190 --> 01:27:12,189
The rope opposite your house on
which you hang your clothes.

1464
01:27:12,190 --> 01:27:15,129
- Go and bring it.
- Surely bring it.

1465
01:27:15,130 --> 01:27:17,129
Just a minute.

1466
01:27:17,130 --> 01:27:19,899
Bring the rope on which
you hang your clothes.

1467
01:27:19,900 --> 01:27:21,799
Not the neighbours.

1468
01:27:21,800 --> 01:27:26,200
I feel like I have heard your
voice before somewhere.

1469
01:27:26,210 --> 01:27:29,370
Even I have seen your
face somewhere before.

1470
01:27:29,380 --> 01:27:31,740
'Okay, okay."

1471
01:27:31,880 --> 01:27:35,949
- Rope!
- Come from that side.

1472
01:27:35,950 --> 01:27:37,449
Will this do? So much rope.

1473
01:27:37,450 --> 01:27:39,218
Have you come in a
marriage that you...

1474
01:27:39,219 --> 01:27:40,618
want me to put it
like a 'Mangalsutra'.

1475
01:27:40,619 --> 01:27:42,950
Bring a bigger rope. Otherwise
you have seen the gun?

1476
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:45,160
I will smash you and reduce
you to 2 feet. Understood?

1477
01:27:45,161 --> 01:27:47,229
'Sir, we will manage it, right?"

1478
01:27:47,230 --> 01:27:49,229
Come on. Give me the rope.

1479
01:27:49,230 --> 01:27:52,220
'Tie, tie them. Tie him up."

1480
01:27:53,170 --> 01:27:56,769
'Joker B, Joker S, help us."

1481
01:27:56,770 --> 01:28:00,830
And yes everyone must use
little rope. Don't cheat.

1482
01:28:00,970 --> 01:28:04,509
- "Is it tight?
- Sir, I don't even like it loose."

1483
01:28:04,510 --> 01:28:08,249
- "Good, now it will not open up.
- No, no not at all."

1484
01:28:08,250 --> 01:28:11,579
"It will not move till the morning.
Sir, I give you my word."

1485
01:28:11,580 --> 01:28:13,680
- "Good.
- Yes, sir."

1486
01:28:17,590 --> 01:28:19,420
Now what are you doing
by bending down.

1487
01:28:19,430 --> 01:28:20,558
I am trying to open the lock.

1488
01:28:20,559 --> 01:28:21,788
Who had asked you to lock it?

1489
01:28:21,789 --> 01:28:23,260
If we will lock it then
the neighbours...

1490
01:28:23,261 --> 01:28:24,899
will know that we had gone out.

1491
01:28:24,900 --> 01:28:26,530
Otherwise they will
Feel we are sitting outside.

1492
01:28:26,531 --> 01:28:29,690
Don't hit. I will open it.

1493
01:28:32,200 --> 01:28:34,009
At least take me in.

1494
01:28:34,010 --> 01:28:37,840
"Yes, come in. The main
item is left out."

1495
01:28:40,210 --> 01:28:44,980
I have shut the door. Very
good. All have come in.

1496
01:28:45,220 --> 01:28:47,980
You have still worn the costume!

1497
01:29:02,230 --> 01:29:04,299
Did they disappear in
thin air like pigeons?

1498
01:29:04,300 --> 01:29:06,240
Come with me.

1499
01:29:12,550 --> 01:29:15,880
'Come on now the loot, the loot."

1500
01:29:17,250 --> 01:29:20,340
After a lot of days I will get
to see some green notes.

1501
01:29:20,390 --> 01:29:21,949
This is just grass.

1502
01:29:21,950 --> 01:29:24,659
This is not grass. It will
be below it. You know.

1503
01:29:24,660 --> 01:29:27,329
Just like there is grass
above the mangoes.

1504
01:29:27,330 --> 01:29:30,629
The goods must be below it. See.

1505
01:29:30,630 --> 01:29:31,929
There is nothing here.

1506
01:29:31,930 --> 01:29:33,330
There is only flour here.

1507
01:29:33,331 --> 01:29:39,669
After doing so much of hard
work what did we get?

1508
01:29:39,670 --> 01:29:42,570
Fodder for the cattle.

1509
01:29:42,580 --> 01:29:43,780
He will kill us.

1510
01:29:43,781 --> 01:29:48,979
This is not grass. These are drugs.

1511
01:29:48,980 --> 01:29:51,310
- Drugs.
- Yes.

1512
01:29:52,350 --> 01:29:54,989
- And this is heroine.
- Of which picture?

1513
01:29:54,990 --> 01:29:57,418
Not the heroine of the pictures.
These are drugs.

1514
01:29:57,419 --> 01:29:59,088
"Keep it back, we will
give it to the police."

1515
01:29:59,089 --> 01:30:00,660
They will do whatever has
to be done about it.

1516
01:30:00,661 --> 01:30:04,859
'You fool, we want crores and lakhs."

1517
01:30:04,860 --> 01:30:06,360
What are you saying? Not even your...

1518
01:30:06,370 --> 01:30:08,800
father will give you lakh
rupees for this fodder.

1519
01:30:08,801 --> 01:30:11,799
This stuff is not worth
lakhs but crores.

1520
01:30:11,800 --> 01:30:12,968
How do you know?

1521
01:30:12,969 --> 01:30:14,108
I know about everything.

1522
01:30:14,109 --> 01:30:15,368
I even know that the four...

1523
01:30:15,369 --> 01:30:17,108
five crores they were talking about.

1524
01:30:17,109 --> 01:30:18,940
They were talking
about these drugs...

1525
01:30:18,941 --> 01:30:24,449
and I know another person
who deals in this.

1526
01:30:24,450 --> 01:30:29,389
- We will get three crores for it.
- Three crores?

1527
01:30:29,390 --> 01:30:32,059
"Will we be able to settle
our dues, Raju?"

1528
01:30:32,060 --> 01:30:34,030
We will be able to settle
all our dues.

1529
01:30:34,031 --> 01:30:35,389
Whatever will be left.

1530
01:30:35,390 --> 01:30:39,059
From the remaining money I
will sell incense sticks.

1531
01:30:39,060 --> 01:30:40,930
Did you tell a joke?

1532
01:30:41,070 --> 01:30:43,699
Go to sleep. Think you have
become a millionaire.

1533
01:30:43,700 --> 01:30:46,000
And sleep properly.

1534
01:31:15,400 --> 01:31:19,900
Con game again a con game.

1535
01:31:19,910 --> 01:31:24,779
Con game again a con game.

1536
01:31:24,780 --> 01:31:27,179
Have seen the roubles of Russia.

1537
01:31:27,180 --> 01:31:29,579
Have seen the yens of Japan.

1538
01:31:29,580 --> 01:31:31,979
Have seen the euros of Europe.

1539
01:31:31,980 --> 01:31:34,449
Have seen the American
dollars of America.

1540
01:31:34,450 --> 01:31:39,159
Even then this heart desires
the Indian rupee.

1541
01:31:39,160 --> 01:31:43,829
I love rupee! Rupee!
Just the rupee!

1542
01:31:43,830 --> 01:31:48,869
'Love rupees, rupees!"

1543
01:31:48,870 --> 01:31:51,169
Have seen the roubles of Russia.

1544
01:31:51,170 --> 01:31:53,639
Have seen the yens of Japan.

1545
01:31:53,640 --> 01:31:55,970
Have seen the euros of Europe.

1546
01:31:55,980 --> 01:31:58,509
Have seen the American
dollars of America.

1547
01:31:58,510 --> 01:32:03,110
Even then this heart
desires the rupee.

1548
01:32:03,120 --> 01:32:07,789
'I love rupees, rupees, rupees."

1549
01:32:07,790 --> 01:32:13,190
'I love rupees, rupees, rupees."

1550
01:32:34,710 --> 01:32:39,010
Con game again a con game.

1551
01:33:00,940 --> 01:33:05,579
Con game again a con game.

1552
01:33:05,580 --> 01:33:10,980
Con game again a con game.

1553
01:33:11,080 --> 01:33:15,549
Raju give me my money!
I will kill you.

1554
01:33:15,550 --> 01:33:18,019
'Speak softly, softly!"

1555
01:33:18,020 --> 01:33:20,559
Even the walls have ears.
Speak softly.

1556
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:22,490
What happened?

1557
01:33:27,500 --> 01:33:29,570
"You speak a little louder,
I cannot hear anything."

1558
01:33:29,571 --> 01:33:36,009
"I dreamt that Raju ran away
with my money, that thief."

1559
01:33:36,010 --> 01:33:38,210
Anyways the dreams that you see
at 5' O clock always become true.

1560
01:33:38,211 --> 01:33:40,709
Even I had a dream in the morning...

1561
01:33:40,710 --> 01:33:42,579
that you are running away with...

1562
01:33:42,580 --> 01:33:43,718
my money and I am murdering you.

1563
01:33:43,719 --> 01:33:44,880
What are you saying?

1564
01:33:44,881 --> 01:33:46,580
That means Raju is murdered and...

1565
01:33:46,590 --> 01:33:48,050
you will be sentenced to death.

1566
01:33:48,051 --> 01:33:51,759
That will mean that all the
money will be only mine.

1567
01:33:51,760 --> 01:33:55,660
Just keep quiet.

1568
01:33:57,760 --> 01:34:03,269
"Hey Shinde, hey Mhatre, all
you gentleman come here."

1569
01:34:03,270 --> 01:34:06,539
"Bhai, this guy with the loincloth
seems to be very excited!"

1570
01:34:06,540 --> 01:34:09,539
I will make it entirely AC.

1571
01:34:09,540 --> 01:34:11,609
The entire toilet will be made AC.

1572
01:34:11,610 --> 01:34:14,179
And the tumbler will
be made up of silver.

1573
01:34:14,180 --> 01:34:16,179
I will make the entire chawl AC.

1574
01:34:16,180 --> 01:34:18,979
Has he stolen our goods?

1575
01:34:18,980 --> 01:34:22,850
This black spectacle
and white pigeon!

1576
01:34:22,860 --> 01:34:24,659
What will he rob?

1577
01:34:24,660 --> 01:34:27,329
If anything happens
in the neighbourhood.

1578
01:34:27,330 --> 01:34:29,230
He is the first one to get scared.

1579
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:32,129
All the females come forward.

1580
01:34:32,130 --> 01:34:35,629
From today no female will have to
stand in the queue for water.

1581
01:34:35,630 --> 01:34:39,199
I am going to put three
taps in everyone's house.

1582
01:34:39,200 --> 01:34:40,709
- 3 taps.
- Yes.

1583
01:34:40,710 --> 01:34:43,639
The one who wants to take
bath with hot water?

1584
01:34:43,640 --> 01:34:45,639
Will use the hot water tap.

1585
01:34:45,640 --> 01:34:47,010
The others will use
the coldwater tap.

1586
01:34:47,011 --> 01:34:49,649
- And the third tap?
- There won't be water in that.

1587
01:34:49,650 --> 01:34:51,150
And those who don't
want to take a bath.

1588
01:34:51,151 --> 01:34:53,380
They will sit below the 3rd tap.

1589
01:34:53,850 --> 01:34:56,080
You fool.

1590
01:34:56,660 --> 01:34:59,289
Is it your father's marriage?

1591
01:34:59,290 --> 01:35:02,659
"Yes, my father married and
that is why I was born."

1592
01:35:02,660 --> 01:35:04,299
Not like you.

1593
01:35:04,300 --> 01:35:06,660
We have to give money to that lisp
guy till evening and this Babu-bhaiya...

1594
01:35:06,670 --> 01:35:07,930
'Get up Raju, Raju..."

1595
01:35:07,931 --> 01:35:11,739
I had a very bad dream
that Babu-bhai...

1596
01:35:11,740 --> 01:35:15,239
was telling everyone in the
chawl before we got the money.

1597
01:35:15,240 --> 01:35:18,679
He is really telling everyone
in front of the whole chawl.

1598
01:35:18,680 --> 01:35:20,209
What are you saying?

1599
01:35:20,210 --> 01:35:23,049
Yes I am saying lets wrap
everything and leave from here.

1600
01:35:23,050 --> 01:35:24,679
Or else the police will catch us.

1601
01:35:24,680 --> 01:35:25,819
Stop him.

1602
01:35:25,820 --> 01:35:27,220
I will take care
of everything here. You go.

1603
01:35:27,221 --> 01:35:28,819
Don't create chaos in public.

1604
01:35:28,820 --> 01:35:30,859
You have just robbed the
change from the temple.

1605
01:35:30,860 --> 01:35:32,690
You change stealer!

1606
01:35:33,630 --> 01:35:36,290
I have not robbed from the temple.

1607
01:35:36,300 --> 01:35:38,199
I have robbed a thief's house.

1608
01:35:38,200 --> 01:35:40,629
Should I say what I did yesterday?

1609
01:35:40,630 --> 01:35:43,699
'Babu-bhaiya, Babu-bhaiya if you..."

1610
01:35:43,700 --> 01:35:46,700
have won a lottery
of five thousand...

1611
01:35:46,710 --> 01:35:49,709
there is no need to shout and
tell the everyone about it.

1612
01:35:49,710 --> 01:35:52,140
He has lost it by winning
5000 rupees.

1613
01:35:52,780 --> 01:35:58,150
Listen to this! In 5000 rupees he
wants to put 3 taps. That drunkard!

1614
01:35:59,380 --> 01:36:01,219
Bring him here.

1615
01:36:01,220 --> 01:36:02,819
You loincloth stealer!

1616
01:36:02,820 --> 01:36:05,919
'Babu-bhaiya, what are you doing?"

1617
01:36:05,920 --> 01:36:07,728
The child is not even born and you...

1618
01:36:07,729 --> 01:36:09,790
are also celebrating his birthday
in front of the whole society.

1619
01:36:09,800 --> 01:36:12,359
Child? So you are going
to have a child?

1620
01:36:12,360 --> 01:36:14,469
But Raju when did he get married?

1621
01:36:14,470 --> 01:36:17,899
"He did not get married,
you stupid person."

1622
01:36:17,900 --> 01:36:19,038
We have not even got the cash...

1623
01:36:19,039 --> 01:36:20,440
and you have even enjoying yourself.

1624
01:36:20,441 --> 01:36:22,740
Where did you bring this pizza from?

1625
01:36:23,710 --> 01:36:25,739
Domino's has a scheme that if it...

1626
01:36:25,740 --> 01:36:29,009
doesn't come in 30 minutes
then you get it free.

1627
01:36:29,010 --> 01:36:30,179
So I got it!

1628
01:36:30,180 --> 01:36:31,948
That means he got it
after 30 minutes.

1629
01:36:31,949 --> 01:36:33,750
"No, no. He had come
in twenty minutes."

1630
01:36:33,751 --> 01:36:35,249
I kept hiding from him.

1631
01:36:35,250 --> 01:36:36,819
I didn't come in front of him.

1632
01:36:36,820 --> 01:36:40,829
He kept looking for
me here and there.

1633
01:36:40,830 --> 01:36:43,090
As soon as 30 minutes passed
I came in front of him.

1634
01:36:43,100 --> 01:36:44,759
I told him give me my free pizza.

1635
01:36:44,760 --> 01:36:46,130
Then I will also eat it free.

1636
01:36:46,131 --> 01:36:48,399
"Yes, both of you sit here
and enjoy yourself."

1637
01:36:48,400 --> 01:36:49,768
And I will go and do all the work.

1638
01:36:49,769 --> 01:36:51,198
I will sell the goods
to the junk seller.

1639
01:36:51,199 --> 01:36:52,770
Get the deal done fast!
Today is the last day...

1640
01:36:52,771 --> 01:36:54,770
and we have to pay
back that lisp guy...

1641
01:36:54,771 --> 01:36:56,770
I am only taking the
sample along with me.

1642
01:36:56,780 --> 01:36:58,779
And staple the mouth of this fool.

1643
01:36:58,780 --> 01:37:00,940
Loincloth stealer!

1644
01:37:01,310 --> 01:37:04,210
- Let's go.
- Loin cloth stealer!

1645
01:37:10,120 --> 01:37:11,820
He is the one!

1646
01:37:12,860 --> 01:37:16,790
Come tomorrow. The gun guy.

1647
01:37:20,500 --> 01:37:22,099
'Bhai, Kachra Seth."

1648
01:37:22,100 --> 01:37:26,660
- "Yes tell me, Kachra Seth.
- That gun guy has come."

1649
01:37:27,370 --> 01:37:29,809
Do one thing. Sit on your bike
and come here.

1650
01:37:29,810 --> 01:37:31,809
Till then I will take care of him...

1651
01:37:31,810 --> 01:37:33,640
Okay. Come on.

1652
01:37:43,820 --> 01:37:46,520
This is a very nice product.

1653
01:37:46,890 --> 01:37:50,059
- "Take this, 5000.
- This is only the sample, sir."

1654
01:37:50,060 --> 01:37:51,829
I have hundreds of kilos of it.

1655
01:37:51,830 --> 01:37:54,569
Hundreds of kilos?

1656
01:37:54,570 --> 01:37:57,660
That means you have goods
worth 2 to 3 crores.

1657
01:37:57,770 --> 01:38:00,839
Do you have a field of drugs?

1658
01:38:00,840 --> 01:38:03,109
"The goods are ready,
where is the cash?"

1659
01:38:03,110 --> 01:38:04,839
What are you saying?

1660
01:38:04,840 --> 01:38:07,979
Does anybody keep two crores
in the junk shop.

1661
01:38:07,980 --> 01:38:12,049
'Do one thing, you call me."

1662
01:38:12,050 --> 01:38:15,990
This is my mobile number.
Call me at 4 o'clock.

1663
01:38:18,860 --> 01:38:20,690
Eena... Meena... Deeka.

1664
01:38:21,830 --> 01:38:27,469
How do you know the names
of all my three daughters?

1665
01:38:27,470 --> 01:38:28,930
They study in my college.

1666
01:38:28,931 --> 01:38:31,899
Hey! But they study in
the third standard.

1667
01:38:31,900 --> 01:38:34,869
Listen to me... listen... listen.

1668
01:38:34,870 --> 01:38:37,879
"Leena-ji, Tina-ji, Meena-ji,
at least listen to me."

1669
01:38:37,880 --> 01:38:38,979
Meena-ji.

1670
01:38:38,980 --> 01:38:40,480
- Why are you after me?
- I am interested in you.

1671
01:38:40,481 --> 01:38:41,879
What?

1672
01:38:41,880 --> 01:38:44,949
I mean that I have to give you
money. And even the interest.

1673
01:38:44,950 --> 01:38:48,589
Listen to me... where are you going?
There is sea there.

1674
01:38:48,590 --> 01:38:51,560
Whether I go in the sea or the
well? Why do you bother?

1675
01:38:54,030 --> 01:38:55,860
Hey see that!

1676
01:38:57,830 --> 01:39:00,865
Hey pretty woman!
Where is your brother?

1677
01:39:00,866 --> 01:39:03,899
You people.

1678
01:39:03,900 --> 01:39:09,639
"If I will hit you, you will
forget all your nonsense."

1679
01:39:09,640 --> 01:39:10,909
Understood!

1680
01:39:10,910 --> 01:39:12,039
Hey you.

1681
01:39:12,040 --> 01:39:13,178
'Let it be, let it be."

1682
01:39:13,179 --> 01:39:14,448
Did you recognize? He
is that mad lover.

1683
01:39:14,449 --> 01:39:16,940
First he swindled twenty lakh
rupees from the girls brother.

1684
01:39:18,020 --> 01:39:21,519
And now when our Tiwari boss
had the girl kidnapped.

1685
01:39:21,520 --> 01:39:23,390
Then he came in front of him and...

1686
01:39:23,391 --> 01:39:27,480
says that you can take my life
but please spare this girl.

1687
01:39:33,870 --> 01:39:35,929
If he doesn't give the
money till the...

1688
01:39:35,930 --> 01:39:38,370
evening then he won't be spared.

1689
01:39:40,870 --> 01:39:42,469
So this is your reality?

1690
01:39:42,470 --> 01:39:44,409
No. I am not like that.

1691
01:39:44,410 --> 01:39:45,540
Like the way you think I am.

1692
01:39:45,541 --> 01:39:48,480
This is because I had
become a bit greedy.

1693
01:39:48,950 --> 01:39:51,710
I got stuck because of all the money.

1694
01:39:53,150 --> 01:39:56,950
Sorry because of me you and your...

1695
01:39:56,960 --> 01:40:00,889
family members have been troubled.

1696
01:40:00,890 --> 01:40:03,229
"Today evening, everything
will be all right."

1697
01:40:03,230 --> 01:40:05,660
I am sorry.

1698
01:40:07,900 --> 01:40:09,730
I apologise.

1699
01:40:11,940 --> 01:40:14,909
I don't think that you
will forgive me.

1700
01:40:14,910 --> 01:40:18,470
"Leena, Meena, Tina whatever
your name is."

1701
01:40:27,720 --> 01:40:30,389
- Listen.
- Yes.

1702
01:40:30,390 --> 01:40:32,910
Second of all my name is Anjali.

1703
01:40:33,190 --> 01:40:35,450
'I am sorry, Anjali-ji."

1704
01:40:35,930 --> 01:40:39,730
Second thing? Then what
was the first thing?

1705
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:43,630
"That, when are you
returning my money?"

1706
01:40:43,640 --> 01:40:45,430
Which money?

1707
01:40:55,680 --> 01:40:58,440
But I don't have change.

1708
01:40:59,150 --> 01:41:02,019
The spicy snacks of this place
are famous in whole Mumbai.

1709
01:41:02,020 --> 01:41:03,680
Should we go?

1710
01:41:10,300 --> 01:41:14,090
I am feeling shy. Come.

1711
01:41:17,100 --> 01:41:21,539
How many desires...

1712
01:41:21,540 --> 01:41:26,770
'Have aroused for you, my beloved."

1713
01:41:48,130 --> 01:41:52,699
How many desires...

1714
01:41:52,700 --> 01:41:56,570
'Have aroused for you, my beloved."

1715
01:41:56,580 --> 01:42:01,079
How many desires...

1716
01:42:01,080 --> 01:42:05,179
'Have aroused for you, my beloved."

1717
01:42:05,180 --> 01:42:09,489
"All day, all night... I am
troubled by your memories."

1718
01:42:09,490 --> 01:42:16,089
I am troubled by your memories.

1719
01:42:16,090 --> 01:42:20,299
"All day, all night... I am
troubled by your memories."

1720
01:42:20,300 --> 01:42:22,369
I am troubled by your memories.

1721
01:42:22,370 --> 01:42:25,099
Understand the language of the heart.

1722
01:42:25,100 --> 01:42:26,839
Lets exchange hearts.

1723
01:42:26,840 --> 01:42:31,179
I am troubled by your memories.

1724
01:42:31,180 --> 01:42:36,080
I am troubled by your memories.

1725
01:42:44,320 --> 01:42:48,529
Why does my heart remain
lonely in your love?

1726
01:42:48,530 --> 01:42:53,059
"I go through restlessness
every moment, beloved."

1727
01:42:53,060 --> 01:42:57,130
Why does my heart remain
lonely in your love?

1728
01:42:57,140 --> 01:43:01,439
"I go through restlessness
every moment, beloved."

1729
01:43:01,440 --> 01:43:03,409
Don't leave me.

1730
01:43:03,410 --> 01:43:05,709
Come into my life.

1731
01:43:05,710 --> 01:43:07,809
Come into my life.

1732
01:43:07,810 --> 01:43:14,810
How many desires...

1733
01:43:14,820 --> 01:43:18,719
'Have aroused for you, my beloved."

1734
01:43:18,720 --> 01:43:22,889
"All day, all night... I am
troubled by your memories."

1735
01:43:22,890 --> 01:43:25,159
I am troubled by your memories.

1736
01:43:25,160 --> 01:43:29,569
I am troubled by your memories.

1737
01:43:29,570 --> 01:43:31,669
- What happened?
- Raju has still not come.

1738
01:43:31,670 --> 01:43:34,409
That lisp guy's men can
come back anytime.

1739
01:43:34,410 --> 01:43:37,539
Let's search for Raju
before they come back.

1740
01:43:37,540 --> 01:43:39,340
- What do you say?
- Come on.

1741
01:43:56,190 --> 01:44:01,529
"Oh God, I am tired of
searching for him."

1742
01:44:01,530 --> 01:44:04,199
I have even asked all
the junk sellers.

1743
01:44:04,200 --> 01:44:07,200
A junk seller even hit me.

1744
01:44:07,210 --> 01:44:08,440
"Babu-bhaiya, if you
will ask a junk..."

1745
01:44:08,441 --> 01:44:10,209
seller that did somebody come...

1746
01:44:10,210 --> 01:44:12,310
here to sell drugs then
they will surely hit you.

1747
01:44:12,311 --> 01:44:15,309
Where did that scoundrel go?

1748
01:44:15,310 --> 01:44:17,949
You please be quiet. We will
surely find him somewhere.

1749
01:44:17,950 --> 01:44:20,180
There are four-five
junk sellers here.

1750
01:44:20,620 --> 01:44:23,950
- "Anuradha?
- What are you saying, Anuradha?"

1751
01:44:23,960 --> 01:44:25,390
"Not Anuradha, how will
you sell Anuradha?"

1752
01:44:25,391 --> 01:44:28,720
- "I mean this Anuradha, Babu.
- Oh my god!"

1753
01:44:30,530 --> 01:44:32,690
There she is catch her!

1754
01:44:34,170 --> 01:44:35,899
'Babu, come fast."

1755
01:44:35,900 --> 01:44:37,960
"- You double things, isn't it?"

1756
01:44:40,440 --> 01:44:43,700
Why is the military after us?

1757
01:44:43,980 --> 01:44:45,240
Babu-bhaiya if we will listen to...

1758
01:44:45,241 --> 01:44:47,979
Raju then we will surely
get killed today.

1759
01:44:47,980 --> 01:44:49,840
Come on quickly.

1760
01:44:51,250 --> 01:44:52,719
'Oh, hey Shyam."

1761
01:44:52,720 --> 01:44:54,249
'What happened, Babu-bhiaya? -"

1762
01:44:54,250 --> 01:44:55,388
This loincloth is coming in between.

1763
01:44:55,389 --> 01:44:57,288
Then why do you wear in an open form?

1764
01:44:57,289 --> 01:44:59,718
If you say then I will take
this loincloth off and run.

1765
01:44:59,719 --> 01:45:00,920
You sit on the car I will take you.

1766
01:45:00,930 --> 01:45:03,950
Move... move...

1767
01:45:06,200 --> 01:45:08,360
Wait Anuradha! Stop!

1768
01:45:09,200 --> 01:45:12,730
I will throw the banana peel
and she will slip on it.

1769
01:45:19,880 --> 01:45:22,440
Where are you taking the
municipality with you on the cart?

1770
01:45:24,220 --> 01:45:26,880
Seems like she has swindled
the militaries money also.

1771
01:45:26,890 --> 01:45:31,250
The military people are catching
my Anuradha. Anuradha!

1772
01:45:31,620 --> 01:45:34,759
Today is first day of our love.
You will have to eat one more.

1773
01:45:34,760 --> 01:45:37,060
Close your eyes. Open your mouth

1774
01:45:39,230 --> 01:45:41,720
'Anuradha, wait!"

1775
01:45:43,500 --> 01:45:45,599
- She swindled my money.
- What?

1776
01:45:45,600 --> 01:45:47,300
I am not telling you.

1777
01:45:47,310 --> 01:45:49,025
"Cath her!

1778
01:45:49,026 --> 01:45:50,740
This, this why has Shyam
going to sell Baburao?"

1779
01:45:57,850 --> 01:46:01,010
"Catch her. Catch her.
She was running, right?"

1780
01:46:01,290 --> 01:46:03,050
Catch her!

1781
01:46:04,520 --> 01:46:08,480
"They are hitting my Anuradha,
Babu-bhaiya."

1782
01:46:09,260 --> 01:46:11,820
'Shyam, where are the brakes in this?"

1783
01:46:12,060 --> 01:46:14,360
Long live Maharashtra!

1784
01:46:14,370 --> 01:46:17,530
- "Remove the diamonds.
- Leave, leave me."

1785
01:46:17,540 --> 01:46:20,339
Military brothers what are you doing?

1786
01:46:20,340 --> 01:46:22,008
This is Anuradha. Please
behave nicely.

1787
01:46:22,009 --> 01:46:23,570
'Leave her, she has taken my money."

1788
01:46:23,580 --> 01:46:24,910
"- Leave her, leave her."

1789
01:46:24,911 --> 01:46:27,040
They are not the military
they are goons.

1790
01:46:27,050 --> 01:46:30,349
Oh God! They are all goons.
Lets flee from here.

1791
01:46:30,350 --> 01:46:33,549
Babu-bhaiya... my Anuradha!
Have I told you? Don't hit!

1792
01:46:33,550 --> 01:46:39,919
"Have I told you? Have I told you?
Leave her, leave her."

1793
01:46:39,920 --> 01:46:44,090
My Anuradha!
Have I told you? Don't hit!

1794
01:46:44,100 --> 01:46:46,930
'Raju, hit him."

1795
01:46:49,300 --> 01:46:50,969
My glass!

1796
01:46:50,970 --> 01:46:57,530
What are you doing? Go home.
You are hitting your own man.

1797
01:47:06,550 --> 01:47:11,550
Where is the money? Hold her.
Hold her and keep.

1798
01:47:18,330 --> 01:47:19,890
Let me go!

1799
01:47:25,670 --> 01:47:32,670
But where did I hit you?
With the bamboo.

1800
01:47:33,510 --> 01:47:40,510
Come here. Give my money right now.

1801
01:47:40,550 --> 01:47:43,419
- "Raju, don't be so tense, Raju.
- Give my money."

1802
01:47:43,420 --> 01:47:45,910
Carefully. It will come out.

1803
01:47:48,660 --> 01:47:52,459
That means that goon
who was with Kabira.

1804
01:47:52,460 --> 01:47:54,490
You are her sister.

1805
01:47:54,500 --> 01:47:59,399
My sister was divorced and
she even had a daughter.

1806
01:47:59,400 --> 01:48:02,769
I don't know when she started
working for Kabira's gang.

1807
01:48:02,770 --> 01:48:06,979
The police put my sister
in jail along with Kabira.

1808
01:48:06,980 --> 01:48:11,379
And that is why I lost my job.

1809
01:48:11,380 --> 01:48:14,649
But the responsibility of
her daughter came on me.

1810
01:48:14,650 --> 01:48:19,389
I had no other option but
to work in a dance bar.

1811
01:48:19,390 --> 01:48:21,459
One day when I reached home.

1812
01:48:21,460 --> 01:48:24,729
I got a letter from an
important man of Kabira...

1813
01:48:24,730 --> 01:48:27,829
That if you want to
see the daughter...

1814
01:48:27,830 --> 01:48:30,469
of your sister alive then
open a fake finance company.

1815
01:48:30,470 --> 01:48:32,469
And those three who have swindled...

1816
01:48:32,470 --> 01:48:34,539
money from Kabira extract money...

1817
01:48:34,540 --> 01:48:37,370
from them and that too double.

1818
01:48:39,210 --> 01:48:42,479
I converted all the money that
I got from you...

1819
01:48:42,480 --> 01:48:45,479
all in diamonds as per their say...

1820
01:48:45,480 --> 01:48:49,749
But when I reached on the address
that they had given me then...

1821
01:48:49,750 --> 01:48:51,090
What? The girl has run away.

1822
01:48:51,091 --> 01:48:53,589
You can't even keep an
eye on a small child.

1823
01:48:53,590 --> 01:48:56,659
"The child's aunt will come with
diamonds, what will I tell her?"

1824
01:48:56,660 --> 01:48:57,790
What will I tell her?

1825
01:48:57,800 --> 01:49:03,200
- She has arrived. - Give me diamonds.
- No! - Catch her!

1826
01:49:11,140 --> 01:49:14,709
- "Abdul uncle, uncle!
- Dear, you? - Let's go from here."

1827
01:49:14,710 --> 01:49:16,508
My car has broken down.
It will take time.

1828
01:49:16,509 --> 01:49:17,710
There are goons behind me.

1829
01:49:17,720 --> 01:49:20,749
"Oh my God, uncle this is someone's
priced possession."

1830
01:49:20,750 --> 01:49:27,059
You take care of it. To save
my life from these goons.

1831
01:49:27,060 --> 01:49:30,529
When I reached Abdul uncle's house...

1832
01:49:30,530 --> 01:49:34,660
after giving a slip to the
goons... he was lying on his deathbed.

1833
01:49:35,470 --> 01:49:41,869
"Uncle, the possession that I
had given you to keep safely."

1834
01:49:41,870 --> 01:49:43,700
Where is it?

1835
01:49:46,480 --> 01:49:47,940
Cock-a-doodle-do.

1836
01:49:47,950 --> 01:49:49,079
What?

1837
01:49:49,080 --> 01:49:52,649
- Cock-a-doodle-do.
- Cock-a-doodle-do.

1838
01:49:52,650 --> 01:49:55,550
Seems like before dying
he wanted to see a hen.

1839
01:49:55,650 --> 01:50:01,859
Cock-a-doodle-do. Uncle!

1840
01:50:01,860 --> 01:50:03,559
What about the cock-a-doodle-do?

1841
01:50:03,560 --> 01:50:05,099
Cock-a-doodle-do?

1842
01:50:05,100 --> 01:50:10,330
- Yes. - Cock-a-doodle-do.
- Cock-a-doodle-do.

1843
01:50:15,510 --> 01:50:17,809
How is it? Isn't it very good?

1844
01:50:17,810 --> 01:50:20,240
There are hundreds of kilos of it.

1845
01:50:20,850 --> 01:50:23,109
Tell me how much do you want? Tell.

1846
01:50:23,110 --> 01:50:27,580
"You stupid, you steal my goods
and try to sell it to me."

1847
01:50:27,590 --> 01:50:31,250
"No, no. Where did
I steal your goods?"

1848
01:50:31,260 --> 01:50:32,589
Then who robbed it?

1849
01:50:32,590 --> 01:50:36,259
I don't know who robbed it? A boy...

1850
01:50:36,260 --> 01:50:38,899
had come he was six feet tall
with this six inch packet.

1851
01:50:38,900 --> 01:50:41,599
- Where are the goods?
- With the boy.

1852
01:50:41,600 --> 01:50:43,099
Where is the boy?

1853
01:50:43,100 --> 01:50:46,699
"I don't roam around with
him in my pocket, do I?"

1854
01:50:46,700 --> 01:50:49,609
I have asked him to call. 4 o'clock.

1855
01:50:49,610 --> 01:50:54,540
He only must have called.

1856
01:50:54,650 --> 01:50:57,610
'Hello, Kachra Seth speaking."

1857
01:50:57,620 --> 01:50:58,950
'Yes Kachra seth, Raju speaking."

1858
01:50:58,951 --> 01:51:00,219
It is him.

1859
01:51:00,220 --> 01:51:01,750
Call him here immediately
with the goods.

1860
01:51:01,751 --> 01:51:04,789
I have arranged for the money.

1861
01:51:04,790 --> 01:51:06,659
You quickly bring the goods here.

1862
01:51:06,660 --> 01:51:07,759
Where?

1863
01:51:07,760 --> 01:51:11,629
"Here means Shaitan lane,
Danger house..."

1864
01:51:11,630 --> 01:51:14,729
Andher Nagar in front
of the graveyard.

1865
01:51:14,730 --> 01:51:16,900
"Ok, ok in front of the graveyard,
alright, alright."

1866
01:51:16,901 --> 01:51:18,030
Graveyard?

1867
01:51:18,040 --> 01:51:19,168
One minute...

1868
01:51:19,169 --> 01:51:21,138
Are you calling me to take
the goods or to kill me?

1869
01:51:21,139 --> 01:51:22,268
I don't want to go in the grave.

1870
01:51:22,269 --> 01:51:23,640
"Yes, tell him not
near the graveyard."

1871
01:51:23,641 --> 01:51:25,239
Tell him some place else.

1872
01:51:25,240 --> 01:51:26,800
- Anywhere else.
- Move.

1873
01:51:28,010 --> 01:51:31,310
Kachra Seth have you seen
the Royal circus?

1874
01:51:31,320 --> 01:51:33,355
"Yes, it is in the
open land near Matunga.

1875
01:51:33,356 --> 01:51:35,389
Royal circus. Why?"

1876
01:51:35,390 --> 01:51:36,719
'Please, please."

1877
01:51:36,720 --> 01:51:39,659
He is calling us to the Royal circus.

1878
01:51:39,660 --> 01:51:40,988
Why? Is he a small child?

1879
01:51:40,989 --> 01:51:42,158
He seems big from the face.

1880
01:51:42,159 --> 01:51:43,358
I don't know from the wits.

1881
01:51:43,359 --> 01:51:45,160
"Okay, okay whatever it is.
Call him there immediately."

1882
01:51:45,161 --> 01:51:46,660
'Yes brother, you come here."

1883
01:51:46,661 --> 01:51:49,100
You come to Royal circus.
I am reaching there.

1884
01:51:49,730 --> 01:51:51,670
We will take the good to the Royal...

1885
01:51:51,671 --> 01:51:54,200
circus and become millionaires
in the circus.

1886
01:51:54,210 --> 01:51:59,200
Who will call up that lisp guy?
Put the money in it.

1887
01:52:02,880 --> 01:52:04,749
Tiwari speaking.

1888
01:52:04,750 --> 01:52:07,380
- "Hello, lisp guy!
- What are you doing?"

1889
01:52:07,390 --> 01:52:12,850
"Sorry, sorry hello Tiwari Seth
we have got 40 laks of yours."

1890
01:52:13,660 --> 01:52:18,329
Please come at Royal circus
near Matunga and collect it.

1891
01:52:18,330 --> 01:52:23,029
But why Royal circus? You
come here with the money.

1892
01:52:23,030 --> 01:52:25,969
Because that amount
is very heavy also.

1893
01:52:25,970 --> 01:52:27,700
We will be getting
it there and you...

1894
01:52:27,710 --> 01:52:29,209
come and collect from there. Okay?

1895
01:52:29,210 --> 01:52:31,339
'Okay, okay."

1896
01:52:31,340 --> 01:52:33,570
First class. Let us go quickly.

1897
01:52:34,650 --> 01:52:37,149
We have searched everywhere.

1898
01:52:37,150 --> 01:52:38,718
I will hang everyone upside down...

1899
01:52:38,719 --> 01:52:40,050
and hit them in the circus.

1900
01:52:40,051 --> 01:52:42,019
But still someone took my goods.

1901
01:52:42,020 --> 01:52:43,780
Where are my goods?

1902
01:52:45,060 --> 01:52:46,718
'Munna-bhai, you sold the goods..."

1903
01:52:46,719 --> 01:52:48,120
and you did not even remember me.

1904
01:52:48,130 --> 01:52:50,159
Which goods? Which goods?

1905
01:52:50,160 --> 01:52:51,929
The goods that you sold.

1906
01:52:51,930 --> 01:52:53,730
Why did you give it
to the junk seller?

1907
01:52:53,731 --> 01:52:55,799
He went to sell Nanji-bhai's
goods to Nanji.

1908
01:52:55,800 --> 01:52:57,300
There was going to be
a very big problem.

1909
01:52:57,301 --> 01:53:00,039
Which junk seller? Which goods?

1910
01:53:00,040 --> 01:53:01,740
I will take you to the terrace
and throw you down.

1911
01:53:01,741 --> 01:53:05,009
"Munna-bhai, you promised
me fifty percent."

1912
01:53:05,010 --> 01:53:06,210
And now you are refusing.

1913
01:53:06,211 --> 01:53:07,840
You are of no value!

1914
01:53:07,850 --> 01:53:09,750
You are making stories about the...

1915
01:53:09,751 --> 01:53:12,180
junk seller and trying to confuse me.

1916
01:53:27,700 --> 01:53:29,299
Do you think I am the police guy?

1917
01:53:29,300 --> 01:53:31,200
Are you acting in front of me?

1918
01:53:31,700 --> 01:53:33,330
Didn't it hurt you?

1919
01:53:33,440 --> 01:53:37,509
- "Then why don't you shout?
- Your acting, I will..."

1920
01:53:37,510 --> 01:53:39,200
Tell me where are the goods?

1921
01:53:46,120 --> 01:53:47,780
Tell me where are the goods?

1922
01:53:47,790 --> 01:53:51,780
"Munna-bhai, it is here.
It is right here."

1923
01:53:52,920 --> 01:53:55,480
Now you have to come
on the right track.

1924
01:53:56,730 --> 01:54:00,799
Tell me where are the goods
or I will kill you.

1925
01:54:00,800 --> 01:54:03,320
The goods are not here but there.

1926
01:54:04,170 --> 01:54:06,260
- What did you say?
- It is there.

1927
01:54:18,820 --> 01:54:19,950
The goods are here and we are...

1928
01:54:19,951 --> 01:54:21,549
searching the whole city for it.

1929
01:54:21,550 --> 01:54:26,189
Get the booty out. Get the booty out.
I removed his loin-cloth.

1930
01:54:26,190 --> 01:54:29,159
He has robbed goods
worth 3 to 4 crores.

1931
01:54:29,160 --> 01:54:33,229
Everyone who wears a loincloth
is not Gandhi.

1932
01:54:33,230 --> 01:54:34,829
You are right.

1933
01:54:34,830 --> 01:54:36,000
What is this?

1934
01:54:36,001 --> 01:54:40,239
"BBI, CBI, TBI I will sell them
off. No trouble after that."

1935
01:54:40,240 --> 01:54:41,470
Bring it here. Come on.

1936
01:54:41,471 --> 01:54:46,109
As soon as the three of
them come. Kill them

1937
01:54:46,110 --> 01:54:47,340
Don't spare them.

1938
01:54:47,350 --> 01:54:50,109
- Bhai.
- I will give you. I will give you.

1939
01:54:50,110 --> 01:54:53,079
"Finish the job and you will
get it, understood?"

1940
01:54:53,080 --> 01:54:54,640
Okay.

1941
01:55:09,470 --> 01:55:11,299
They have still not come.

1942
01:55:11,300 --> 01:55:12,599
They must be coming.

1943
01:55:12,600 --> 01:55:14,039
They will come then...

1944
01:55:14,040 --> 01:55:16,030
We will not spare them.

1945
01:55:21,810 --> 01:55:26,619
"One, two, three, four. 4 legs?
Three people were supposed to come."

1946
01:55:26,620 --> 01:55:28,640
Come on attack.

1947
01:55:31,920 --> 01:55:34,220
Tell me where the third man is?

1948
01:55:34,230 --> 01:55:35,780
Third man is upstairs.

1949
01:55:54,910 --> 01:55:58,350
'Come, this is poor home."

1950
01:55:59,280 --> 01:56:01,565
"From today, all are
tensions will be over.

1951
01:56:01,566 --> 01:56:03,849
Come, come."

1952
01:56:03,850 --> 01:56:07,590
The door has opened...

1953
01:56:09,460 --> 01:56:12,429
"No, seems like we have come
in someone else's room."

1954
01:56:12,430 --> 01:56:17,090
Keep sleeping. Sorry. Keep
sleeping. I forgot.

1955
01:56:18,940 --> 01:56:20,869
The temple is mine.

1956
01:56:20,870 --> 01:56:23,670
Even this incense stick is mine.

1957
01:56:24,210 --> 01:56:26,539
Even this house is mine.

1958
01:56:26,540 --> 01:56:29,179
Something seems to be wrong here.

1959
01:56:29,180 --> 01:56:30,793
- Hey Raju! 
- Yes.

1960
01:56:30,794 --> 01:56:34,019
- Seems something has gone wrong.

1961
01:56:34,020 --> 01:56:36,380
'Raju come here, take a look inside."

1962
01:56:36,890 --> 01:56:38,289
Who are these people?

1963
01:56:38,290 --> 01:56:41,450
I don't know? They look like your
relatives from the faces.

1964
01:56:41,530 --> 01:56:45,529
'Shyam, come inside."

1965
01:56:45,530 --> 01:56:47,160
"Seems like the treasure
is very heavy, isn't it?"

1966
01:56:47,161 --> 01:56:49,099
I will help them and come.

1967
01:56:49,100 --> 01:56:50,900
What is it?

1968
01:56:51,900 --> 01:56:53,040
Where are the goods?

1969
01:56:53,041 --> 01:56:55,730
What? They have been stolen?

1970
01:56:57,170 --> 01:57:00,409
First Munna stole it.

1971
01:57:00,410 --> 01:57:03,909
Then we stole it from Munna
and brought it here.

1972
01:57:03,910 --> 01:57:06,619
And then again Munna stole
it from us and took it.

1973
01:57:06,620 --> 01:57:10,019
What is all this con game?

1974
01:57:10,020 --> 01:57:11,990
I am telling you let
us flee from here.

1975
01:57:11,991 --> 01:57:18,990
What is it? Have you kept goons
in the house to kill us?

1976
01:57:19,930 --> 01:57:21,999
They are like eggs.

1977
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:23,429
They are already broken.

1978
01:57:23,430 --> 01:57:25,269
I don't know who are they!

1979
01:57:25,270 --> 01:57:29,169
Go from here. Is this
a railway station?

1980
01:57:29,170 --> 01:57:30,340
Get up from here.

1981
01:57:30,341 --> 01:57:34,109
We pay the rent and these
people come and sleep here.

1982
01:57:34,110 --> 01:57:36,249
Where is the money?

1983
01:57:36,250 --> 01:57:39,549
'Sir, you always ask for the money."

1984
01:57:39,550 --> 01:57:41,319
I said in the evening (Shyam).

1985
01:57:41,320 --> 01:57:42,490
Where did you tell me?

1986
01:57:42,491 --> 01:57:45,089
I meant in the evening.

1987
01:57:45,090 --> 01:57:48,020
"Boss, tell your boss
that we will come..."

1988
01:57:48,030 --> 01:57:50,629
at Royal circus at 5 'O
clock with the goods.

1989
01:57:50,630 --> 01:57:52,230
Until then you can
play on the swings.

1990
01:57:52,231 --> 01:57:56,030
Is it? Till then I will
make you swing.

1991
01:57:57,070 --> 01:57:59,039
Royal circus?

1992
01:57:59,040 --> 01:58:01,769
We will come and give
the money at your home.

1993
01:58:01,770 --> 01:58:03,408
'Yes, then even I am coming with you."

1994
01:58:03,409 --> 01:58:05,038
The problem is that the party will...

1995
01:58:05,039 --> 01:58:06,380
get scared after seeing you.

1996
01:58:06,381 --> 01:58:08,409
If they can see his face only then.

1997
01:58:08,410 --> 01:58:09,550
What is all this happening?

1998
01:58:09,551 --> 01:58:11,540
Run from here.

1999
01:58:14,990 --> 01:58:18,480
Get away!

2000
01:58:19,060 --> 01:58:21,520
Hey don't fall over me.

2001
01:58:21,530 --> 01:58:23,930
Get up. Get up quickly.

2002
01:58:23,990 --> 01:58:26,059
Where are you going?

2003
01:58:26,060 --> 01:58:27,530
Come we will do something.

2004
01:58:27,531 --> 01:58:31,760
Leave me! Raju!

2005
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:33,590
'Come on, sit inside."

2006
01:58:38,040 --> 01:58:40,409
'Look, we will give you the money."

2007
01:58:40,410 --> 01:58:43,479
"You leave the girls we will give
the money, we are not thieves."

2008
01:58:43,480 --> 01:58:45,079
Bring the money in the evening...

2009
01:58:45,080 --> 01:58:48,019
and then take your girls
from the Royal circus.

2010
01:58:48,020 --> 01:58:51,219
'Raju, think something."

2011
01:58:51,220 --> 01:58:53,020
What shall I do?

2012
01:58:55,090 --> 01:58:56,829
Royal circus.

2013
01:58:56,830 --> 01:58:58,590
Come on.

2014
01:59:42,170 --> 01:59:44,209
'Where is Babu, man?"

2015
01:59:44,210 --> 01:59:47,479
"You come on, don't worry. He is on
the left side of the gate. Look,"

2016
01:59:47,480 --> 01:59:49,479
he is gazing at those bananas.

2017
01:59:49,480 --> 01:59:50,649
Babu!

2018
01:59:50,650 --> 01:59:53,149
Why have you made me like
an umbrella in the sun?

2019
01:59:53,150 --> 01:59:55,849
- What are you doing?
- Did you get the goods?

2020
01:59:55,850 --> 01:59:57,250
These are duplicate bags.

2021
01:59:57,251 --> 02:00:00,219
And even the goods are duplicate.

2022
02:00:00,220 --> 02:00:03,559
You come on. No. I'm not coming.
You get my duplicate too.

2023
02:00:03,560 --> 02:00:05,799
"- Oh come on, we'll get
your duplicate later."

2024
02:00:05,800 --> 02:00:09,899
"There is not even a single rupee,
how will you reach the circus?"

2025
02:00:09,900 --> 02:00:12,769
We will reach. Why do you worry?
If God wants then we will reach.

2026
02:00:12,770 --> 02:00:16,169
'Uncle, give me an ice candy."

2027
02:00:16,170 --> 02:00:20,179
You have again come? To have
poison. You go from here.

2028
02:00:20,180 --> 02:00:22,349
"Raju, think how will
we reach the circus?"

2029
02:00:22,350 --> 02:00:25,179
"Raju, think how will
we reach the circus?"

2030
02:00:25,180 --> 02:00:30,489
Come on. Come on. Hey look
at that dramatic company.

2031
02:00:30,490 --> 02:00:33,319
"Hey you are seeing the dramatic
company, Ravan."

2032
02:00:33,320 --> 02:00:35,659
These dramatics people
are from the chawl.

2033
02:00:35,660 --> 02:00:37,330
We will tell them to leave
us at the Royal circus.

2034
02:00:37,331 --> 02:00:39,459
'Come soon! Wait, Ravan-ji!"

2035
02:00:39,460 --> 02:00:41,620
Royal circus?

2036
02:00:47,140 --> 02:00:52,139
Give me a balloon...
give me a balloon.

2037
02:00:52,140 --> 02:00:59,140
"Oh, dear, what are you doing here?
Hey leave the aunt and get the kid!"

2038
02:00:59,920 --> 02:01:03,650
"The aunt will come automatically,
hey old man!"

2039
02:01:13,430 --> 02:01:17,799
Tell your aunt that her possession
is in this Cock-a-doodle-do.

2040
02:01:17,800 --> 02:01:19,239
Cock-a-doodle-do?

2041
02:01:19,240 --> 02:01:21,760
Wait you trouble!

2042
02:01:26,980 --> 02:01:28,740
Cock-a-doodle-do!

2043
02:01:37,190 --> 02:01:39,519
'Hey, you get out!"

2044
02:01:39,520 --> 02:01:42,989
You pollute the air and then
you switch on the fan?

2045
02:01:42,990 --> 02:01:46,260
You have so many Indian burgers!

2046
02:01:48,270 --> 02:01:53,269
Hey you drama guys! Thank you.
If our work today is done...

2047
02:01:53,270 --> 02:01:56,339
then I will give you
1 lakh in donation.

2048
02:01:56,340 --> 02:01:58,439
I swear you might be in any attire.

2049
02:01:58,440 --> 02:02:01,340
You might be even naked.
Ok thank you!

2050
02:02:04,450 --> 02:02:07,419
Did you hear? A donation
of 1 lakh rupees.

2051
02:02:07,420 --> 02:02:11,720
It means the lie is
very big. Let's wait.

2052
02:02:15,430 --> 02:02:19,950
"Dear, where will we find That
guy who lisps is there."

2053
02:02:20,260 --> 02:02:25,030
- "Babu, look there, the lispy is there.
- Where."

2054
02:02:26,740 --> 02:02:28,860
You get only popcorn here.

2055
02:02:33,280 --> 02:02:37,840
He has come before time. Where will
we give him the money from?

2056
02:02:39,620 --> 02:02:42,319
We will do one thing.
We will take money...

2057
02:02:42,320 --> 02:02:45,250
from them and give them.

2058
02:02:49,390 --> 02:02:52,799
An elephant? Where will you
go to sell an elephant?

2059
02:02:52,800 --> 02:02:57,329
Look behind it! Can't you
see that white elephant?

2060
02:02:57,330 --> 02:03:02,769
Oh! We will give him. I
will tell them and come.

2061
02:03:02,770 --> 02:03:03,910
They are standing in the sun.

2062
02:03:03,911 --> 02:03:05,900
Is he related to you? Come on!

2063
02:03:06,880 --> 02:03:13,279
- He has come.
- I will get the booty and kill him.

2064
02:03:13,280 --> 02:03:17,289
Don't do like that. This
is a public place.

2065
02:03:17,290 --> 02:03:19,619
First let us see his face (Surat).

2066
02:03:19,620 --> 02:03:22,589
Then we can blast him
off at Surat station.

2067
02:03:22,590 --> 02:03:25,359
That is why I have got
fake notes for him.

2068
02:03:25,360 --> 02:03:31,060
We will first take our goods from
him. Don't forget my 2 % commission.

2069
02:03:37,310 --> 02:03:40,800
Greetings. Take this.

2070
02:03:43,310 --> 02:03:46,079
- Did you get the goods?
- Did you get the money?

2071
02:03:46,080 --> 02:03:48,519
'Look, I have a bag full of goods."

2072
02:03:48,520 --> 02:03:50,949
I have also not got an empty bag.

2073
02:03:50,950 --> 02:03:53,389
- "So, give me.
- You, give me."

2074
02:03:53,390 --> 02:03:56,150
- You give first.
- Give this one.

2075
02:04:06,040 --> 02:04:10,039
First check whether the
stuff is real or fake.

2076
02:04:10,040 --> 02:04:11,839
Stop being so sincere!

2077
02:04:11,840 --> 02:04:14,779
Even you check the money is genuine.

2078
02:04:14,780 --> 02:04:18,449
- First we will take 40 lakhs and...
- Then we will do it here itself.

2079
02:04:18,450 --> 02:04:19,779
How will we do it here?

2080
02:04:19,780 --> 02:04:21,840
Lets go to the enquiry.
We will do it there.

2081
02:04:23,420 --> 02:04:28,860
- "Sir, his child is lost.
- Yes. - What?"

2082
02:04:29,430 --> 02:04:30,729
What's the child's name?

2083
02:04:30,730 --> 02:04:32,829
- Baburao.
- Baburao.

2084
02:04:32,830 --> 02:04:36,460
But that is my name. I should
have worn 2 of them.

2085
02:04:39,970 --> 02:04:41,380
- "Open it, open it.

2086
02:04:41,381 --> 02:04:44,340
- I am opening it, Babu.
- Give. Give."

2087
02:04:44,370 --> 02:04:49,449
My loincloth is too small.
I should worn a bigger loin cloth.

2088
02:04:49,450 --> 02:04:52,880
Where has Gandhi-ji disappeared
from this 500 rupee note?

2089
02:04:54,920 --> 02:04:57,110
How did Gandhi-ji get
hair on his head?

2090
02:04:57,450 --> 02:05:01,320
This is a multi-star cast note. There
is Shahrukh and Amitabh on them.

2091
02:05:03,390 --> 02:05:10,390
- They all are fake. What are you doing?
- Let me think.

2092
02:05:11,470 --> 02:05:13,399
'Now what will we do, Raju?"

2093
02:05:13,400 --> 02:05:19,039
Listen to me. I know that there
are fake notes in this.

2094
02:05:19,040 --> 02:05:20,960
You both know that there
are fake notes in this.

2095
02:05:20,961 --> 02:05:21,679
Yes.

2096
02:05:21,680 --> 02:05:24,549
But they don't know that there
are fake notes in this.

2097
02:05:24,550 --> 02:05:29,589
- "We will have to tell them, right?
- Please keep quiet!"

2098
02:05:29,590 --> 02:05:33,950
Do one thing. Put them all Come on!

2099
02:05:38,500 --> 02:05:45,500
"Tiwari, come. Money, money.
Come, come."

2100
02:05:53,510 --> 02:05:56,000
Did you get 40 lakhs?

2101
02:05:56,480 --> 02:06:00,280
- "Did you get the girl?
- Girls? - Yes, girls."

2102
02:06:00,450 --> 02:06:04,249
"First give me 40 lakhs, then
I will send the girls."

2103
02:06:04,250 --> 02:06:08,050
First give us girls then
I will give you money.

2104
02:06:08,460 --> 02:06:11,690
- "First, you give me girls.
- You buy girls!"

2105
02:06:12,560 --> 02:06:17,269
We are not buying them. Sometime
with them. We are taking...

2106
02:06:17,270 --> 02:06:20,139
Let it be. I will handle it.

2107
02:06:20,140 --> 02:06:23,539
"I made a mistake, sister. Sorry.
You take her and go."

2108
02:06:23,540 --> 02:06:26,130
Shameless guy! Come on.

2109
02:06:26,510 --> 02:06:28,440
Did you get the girls?

2110
02:06:30,480 --> 02:06:33,610
His whistle is also like him.

2111
02:06:35,750 --> 02:06:37,119
They have come.

2112
02:06:37,120 --> 02:06:39,210
Are we blind? We can also see.

2113
02:06:40,660 --> 02:06:42,990
- She has come.
- Fine.

2114
02:06:47,900 --> 02:06:52,060
'Smarty, give the money!"

2115
02:06:52,570 --> 02:06:55,560
'First, you send the girls."

2116
02:06:56,310 --> 02:06:58,000
Go!

2117
02:07:00,110 --> 02:07:03,309
- Take this.
- Not me. You have to give it to him.

2118
02:07:03,310 --> 02:07:06,019
"Dear you take it, we will
take care of the girls."

2119
02:07:06,020 --> 02:07:10,680
You are elder. Go! He is our man.

2120
02:07:18,530 --> 02:07:19,659
How are you?

2121
02:07:19,660 --> 02:07:22,030
He must have fallen so let
it be. What are you doing?

2122
02:07:26,040 --> 02:07:31,570
Come fast. Did they do anything?

2123
02:07:31,580 --> 02:07:34,809
- Take this?
- These are full 40 lakhs.

2124
02:07:34,810 --> 02:07:41,050
"This is not the full amount. It
must be hundred, two hundred more."

2125
02:07:42,620 --> 02:07:48,060
Seth-ji! I have got the goods.

2126
02:07:49,030 --> 02:07:51,360
He is selling my goods.

2127
02:07:55,700 --> 02:07:59,799
This is too good. We
got wealth and guns.

2128
02:07:59,800 --> 02:08:02,460
'Here, your children should be fine."

2129
02:08:03,310 --> 02:08:08,379
Hey! He sells fake goods.

2130
02:08:08,380 --> 02:08:09,649
Keep quiet!

2131
02:08:09,650 --> 02:08:15,680
You have given me all
fake notes in the bag.

2132
02:08:15,690 --> 02:08:19,119
You will come to know that there
are fake notes inside.

2133
02:08:19,120 --> 02:08:23,389
"You won't spare me. Right? You are
a very dangerous person, right?"

2134
02:08:23,390 --> 02:08:24,990
What did you say?

2135
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:31,269
Hey you! You take my sir's real
stuff and give us fake in return.

2136
02:08:31,270 --> 02:08:35,470
I will hit you with this slipper.

2137
02:08:36,340 --> 02:08:39,740
Raju! See the goods are there.

2138
02:08:48,080 --> 02:08:52,089
Give me 40 lakhs or
else I will kill you!

2139
02:08:52,090 --> 02:08:56,580
- Give me my stuff back.
- From where will I give you?

2140
02:08:56,830 --> 02:09:01,829
What will I do? I am helpless.

2141
02:09:01,830 --> 02:09:07,600
Should I kill him? Get Babu-bhaiya
out from there.

2142
02:09:07,640 --> 02:09:08,939
There is only one way.

2143
02:09:08,940 --> 02:09:15,940
- "The real stuff is in the car.
- Take it, run!"

2144
02:09:16,710 --> 02:09:22,150
Give me the bag.

2145
02:09:28,990 --> 02:09:34,199
Hey heroine! Hey red riding hood!

2146
02:09:34,200 --> 02:09:37,700
"Your pajamas are torn,
your pajamas are torn.

2147
02:09:37,701 --> 02:09:41,200
Where is it torn from?"

2148
02:09:48,480 --> 02:09:51,670
You go there.

2149
02:10:30,790 --> 02:10:33,220
They have got me exhausted.

2150
02:11:05,020 --> 02:11:08,350
Search for him.

2151
02:11:42,060 --> 02:11:45,820
- "There is no circus here.
- I know, don't teach your pop."

2152
02:11:54,070 --> 02:11:57,400
Hold the hand.
Are you out on a stroll?

2153
02:12:11,550 --> 02:12:17,229
- You?
- Joker... we are jokers.

2154
02:12:17,230 --> 02:12:19,929
We will go inside the circus.
And dance and sing.

2155
02:12:19,930 --> 02:12:22,299
Scoundrel! Imitating me?

2156
02:12:22,300 --> 02:12:27,460
"No, I do not imitate. I am
a lisp since childhood."

2157
02:12:27,870 --> 02:12:31,909
My father was also a lisp. My would
be child will also be a lisp.

2158
02:12:31,910 --> 02:12:34,879
Did your father sing
in the orchestra?

2159
02:12:34,880 --> 02:12:36,909
Yes. Yes.

2160
02:12:36,910 --> 02:12:38,649
Which song he used to sing?

2161
02:12:38,650 --> 02:12:41,010
- I sing...
- Yes!

2162
02:12:41,920 --> 02:12:46,519
My heart keeps on singing.

2163
02:12:46,520 --> 02:12:51,929
You are only my destination.

2164
02:12:51,930 --> 02:12:55,129
- Yes. Yes.
- No. No. No.

2165
02:12:55,130 --> 02:12:59,030
His father used to sing something
else. Which song is it?

2166
02:12:59,040 --> 02:13:02,400
Kohl. Kohl.

2167
02:13:02,410 --> 02:13:04,939
'My black, black eyes."

2168
02:13:04,940 --> 02:13:09,609
'Kohl, my black, black eyes."

2169
02:13:09,610 --> 02:13:12,545
"Enough, enough, go
inside, dance and sing.

2170
02:13:12,546 --> 02:13:15,480
Come on."

2171
02:13:17,990 --> 02:13:23,620
"Joker, your loincloth
has fallen down."

2172
02:13:24,260 --> 02:13:29,099
You wear it. Catch him! The bag!

2173
02:13:29,100 --> 02:13:31,229
Run fast!

2174
02:13:31,230 --> 02:13:34,900
Give the bag!

2175
02:13:59,030 --> 02:14:01,430
Shut the program!

2176
02:14:32,330 --> 02:14:34,190
See that!

2177
02:15:10,070 --> 02:15:12,560
Gorilla! I will have a banana.

2178
02:15:14,740 --> 02:15:16,570
Let me take it man.

2179
02:15:17,210 --> 02:15:19,110
What happens if I took a banana?

2180
02:15:24,510 --> 02:15:28,250
'What are you doing 'ooh, ooh'?"

2181
02:15:28,350 --> 02:15:29,980
Do you know me?

2182
02:15:32,260 --> 02:15:35,660
Shut up! Don't glare at me.
Come out if you have the guts.

2183
02:15:36,230 --> 02:15:39,020
Gorilla!

2184
02:16:14,060 --> 02:16:15,890
Thank you. Thank you.

2185
02:16:21,800 --> 02:16:24,739
- "Brother! Brother!
- Shut up! What brother, brother?"

2186
02:16:24,740 --> 02:16:27,279
Why are you so scared?

2187
02:16:27,280 --> 02:16:28,680
Do I look like a gorilla?

2188
02:16:28,681 --> 02:16:31,580
- "The gorilla is behind you, bhai.
- Shut up!"

2189
02:16:34,080 --> 02:16:38,819
If he is behind then am I scared
of him. I have seen many of them.

2190
02:16:38,820 --> 02:16:40,580
Move it.

2191
02:16:58,840 --> 02:17:00,870
Look at the sky.

2192
02:17:01,610 --> 02:17:03,810
The sky.

2193
02:17:05,320 --> 02:17:09,340
- Come on.
- Hey they have run away.

2194
02:17:17,860 --> 02:17:19,690
Here.

2195
02:17:29,870 --> 02:17:31,469
You fooled me.

2196
02:17:31,470 --> 02:17:33,970
Why are you asking for your
stuff from old people?

2197
02:17:36,210 --> 02:17:38,270
'Babu-bhai, you go. You rest."

2198
02:17:42,290 --> 02:17:44,180
- Baby.
- Aunty.

2199
02:17:53,900 --> 02:17:55,730
I am coming up.

2200
02:17:55,800 --> 02:17:59,390
"God, how did I come from
the stall to the balcony?"

2201
02:18:04,910 --> 02:18:07,240
Come. You black bull! Hold this.

2202
02:18:08,240 --> 02:18:09,579
Catch him!

2203
02:18:09,580 --> 02:18:11,210
Kachra!

2204
02:18:24,530 --> 02:18:25,790
Cock-a-doodle-do.

2205
02:18:25,800 --> 02:18:27,399
Cock-a-doodle-do?

2206
02:18:27,400 --> 02:18:30,090
"Yes, Abdul uncle was saying he has
kept something in cock-a-doodle-do..."

2207
02:18:30,600 --> 02:18:37,100
- That means the diamonds are
- Come.

2208
02:18:39,780 --> 02:18:43,949
- "Shyam, diamonds!
- Diamonds?"

2209
02:18:43,950 --> 02:18:46,749
Diamonds are in that
cock-a-doodle-do train. There.

2210
02:18:46,750 --> 02:18:48,910
Leave me!

2211
02:18:49,290 --> 02:18:52,910
Diamonds in the cock-a-doodle do?

2212
02:19:13,980 --> 02:19:20,750
Diamonds are there I got them!

2213
02:19:31,860 --> 02:19:34,760
You came with the pouch
like a Superman.

2214
02:19:35,530 --> 02:19:38,500
- Leave all that. Who pushed me?
- Not me.

2215
02:19:40,340 --> 02:19:41,960
Hey run!

2216
02:19:43,610 --> 02:19:45,230
'One, two. One."

2217
02:19:48,780 --> 02:19:50,440
Catch him!

2218
02:19:50,780 --> 02:19:54,349
I am coming up!
Don't leave him. Catch him.

2219
02:19:54,350 --> 02:19:56,840
Give me diamonds.

2220
02:20:00,820 --> 02:20:04,320
"Raju, catch this bag.

2221
02:20:04,321 --> 02:20:07,820
Not the bag. Babu-bhaiya,
hold the bag."

2222
02:20:17,940 --> 02:20:19,910
Why did you come here?
I was coming.

2223
02:20:19,911 --> 02:20:22,470
You hold the diamonds.
I will save Babu-bhaiya.

2224
02:20:24,310 --> 02:20:25,849
Leave me!

2225
02:20:25,850 --> 02:20:29,010
You want diamonds.
Catch it.

2226
02:20:39,330 --> 02:20:42,890
Why are you sitting on my goods.
Go on the swing!

2227
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:50,170
"Hey Babu-bhaiya, give me
your hand. Don't get scared"

2228
02:20:55,910 --> 02:20:58,350
Get in.

2229
02:20:58,950 --> 02:21:00,920
'Raju, save me."

2230
02:21:04,490 --> 02:21:09,520
- I'll hit you. Get me out!
- Elder brother!

2231
02:21:16,700 --> 02:21:18,429
How come you have become so heavy?

2232
02:21:18,430 --> 02:21:20,039
Who is this?

2233
02:21:20,040 --> 02:21:22,500
'Hey Babu, keep holding."

2234
02:21:23,710 --> 02:21:26,170
'Hey, my pyjama is coming out."

2235
02:21:33,520 --> 02:21:40,390
'Hey hold me, hold me, hold me!"

2236
02:21:41,990 --> 02:21:43,890
Should I leave your hand?

2237
02:21:43,960 --> 02:21:46,620
"Hey, Shyam, I'm feeling tired
now. My hands are paining."

2238
02:21:46,660 --> 02:21:50,599
- You give me your leg.
- If you leave my hand then I will...

2239
02:21:50,600 --> 02:21:54,669
'... kick you with my legs, look."

2240
02:21:54,670 --> 02:21:57,469
'You have strong legs, eh?"

2241
02:21:57,470 --> 02:21:59,960
'Get hold of this scrap dealer, Babu!"

2242
02:22:00,540 --> 02:22:02,170
Hold him! Pull him!

2243
02:22:13,060 --> 02:22:16,550
"Babu-bhaiya, hold on tight,
don't slip now."

2244
02:22:17,060 --> 02:22:23,330
"Don't leave me, I'll give you money
as much you want, don't leave me."

2245
02:22:24,170 --> 02:22:26,169
Don't leave.

2246
02:22:26,170 --> 02:22:28,000
What will I leave him?

2247
02:22:59,940 --> 02:23:02,300
"You are creating so much fuss
for a single banana, man!"

2248
02:23:11,580 --> 02:23:13,170
Hey the diamonds!

2249
02:23:14,880 --> 02:23:21,559
You are coming towards...

2250
02:23:21,560 --> 02:23:28,560
"...me!
Hey, is this a bridge?"

2251
02:23:46,250 --> 02:23:48,178
"No, no, no. I had a banana
so he's following me."

2252
02:23:48,179 --> 02:23:49,680
If I take the diamonds he'll
come till my house.

2253
02:23:49,690 --> 02:23:56,590
- "Brother, let's make a compromise.
- Diamonds!"

2254
02:24:01,030 --> 02:24:05,430
I've got diamonds and my booty too.

2255
02:24:06,200 --> 02:24:09,030
I've got diamonds and my booty too.

2256
02:24:12,270 --> 02:24:15,009
You bulls!

2257
02:24:15,010 --> 02:24:17,030
I've got diamonds after all.

2258
02:24:19,550 --> 02:24:21,170
You lispy!

2259
02:24:28,620 --> 02:24:31,120
I won't leave you.
Do you know who I am?

2260
02:24:32,090 --> 02:24:37,299
'Hey, I didn't, I didn't your 'kurta'."

2261
02:24:37,300 --> 02:24:40,639
I'll tear your 'kurta'.

2262
02:24:40,640 --> 02:24:42,690
I'll tear everyone's clothes.

2263
02:24:42,710 --> 02:24:44,670
Tear!

2264
02:24:46,180 --> 02:24:48,070
Tear clothes!

2265
02:24:51,850 --> 02:24:53,470
You tear. Why aren't you tearing?

2266
02:24:59,660 --> 02:25:01,280
Remove them!

2267
02:25:08,100 --> 02:25:10,669
- 'You tore my pants!
- Hey, police!"

2268
02:25:10,670 --> 02:25:14,999
- "Come on, come on.
- Sir, sir, those two men..."

2269
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:17,100
"...have drugs in their bags.
Catch them, catch them!"

2270
02:25:18,340 --> 02:25:21,570
Those in the middle. In the middle.

2271
02:25:22,180 --> 02:25:24,679
'Come on, come on."

2272
02:25:24,680 --> 02:25:27,679
- 'Give me my booty.
- Come dear, come."

2273
02:25:27,680 --> 02:25:30,450
- 'Come on, run.
- Come on, come on."

2274
02:25:38,090 --> 02:25:42,260
- "Hey, you lisp person!
- Let Babu-bhaiya sit.
- I am sitting."

2275
02:25:46,370 --> 02:25:48,530
'I saved by my skin, Lord!"

2276
02:25:49,140 --> 02:25:51,040
Now until Raju and Shyam don't come...

2277
02:25:51,041 --> 02:25:53,139
I'll take a nap.

2278
02:25:53,140 --> 02:25:56,640
"And after getting up,
I'll kill Munna next door!"

2279
02:25:56,650 --> 02:25:59,140
The bloody scoundrel.

2280
02:26:00,380 --> 02:26:02,750
The loin-cloth thief!

2281
02:26:05,920 --> 02:26:09,119
Have you seen Raju?
Where are they Shyam?

2282
02:26:09,120 --> 02:26:12,129
'Yes. Hey Raju, Shyam."

2283
02:26:12,130 --> 02:26:14,129
The time is up;
We have taken money in advance.

2284
02:26:14,130 --> 02:26:15,399
Give. Hey.

2285
02:26:15,400 --> 02:26:18,799
- 'Hey Munna.
- Take it, take it."

2286
02:26:18,800 --> 02:26:20,740
- 'Hey Munna, my costume.
- Here."

2287
02:26:20,741 --> 02:26:24,670
This is ladies costume.

2288
02:26:26,940 --> 02:26:30,430
- "Give me something.
- I know, take this and shut up."

2289
02:26:32,310 --> 02:26:36,910
Where do I wear this?
You've given me such a small one.

2290
02:26:37,220 --> 02:26:40,850
"Now just see, how I teach all
of them a lesson."

2291
02:27:19,330 --> 02:27:23,630
Hey my beloved.

2292
02:27:31,470 --> 02:27:35,840
Hey my beloved.

2293
02:27:37,050 --> 02:27:40,240
You make my worries disappear.

2294
02:27:40,480 --> 02:27:43,480
Show me the magic. Of your love.

2295
02:27:43,490 --> 02:27:46,250
It's a night before
Thursday. Come.

2296
02:27:46,260 --> 02:27:49,590
Come and give me company.

It's a night before
Thursday. Come.

2298
02:27:53,300 --> 02:27:56,890
Come and give me company.

2299
02:28:11,450 --> 02:28:14,179
'Sunday night, night, come on a drive."

2300
02:28:14,180 --> 02:28:17,910
'Drive by side, drive next to me."

2301
02:28:18,520 --> 02:28:25,520
- I won't be able to stay.
- Without seeing you.

2302
02:28:39,480 --> 02:28:46,480
- I won't be able to stay.
- Away from you.

2303
02:28:54,160 --> 02:28:57,450
You make my worries disappear.

2304
02:28:57,830 --> 02:29:00,520
Show me the magic. Of your love.

2305
02:29:00,560 --> 02:29:02,829
It's a night before
Thursday. Come.

2306
02:29:02,830 --> 02:29:06,530
Come and give me company.

2307
02:29:07,440 --> 02:29:13,640
Come and be my companion.

2308
02:29:14,440 --> 02:29:18,579
Come and give me company.

2309
02:29:18,580 --> 02:29:20,740
Come and give me company.

Come and give me company.

2311
02:29:28,520 --> 02:29:34,690
Come and give me company.

2312
02:29:35,160 --> 02:29:39,999
Hey Raju! This orchestra of Baburao
Ganpat Rao Apte is a hit

2313
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:41,970
Hail Maharashtra.

2314
02:29:42,600 --> 02:29:46,970
Hail... What kind of a dream was it?

2315
02:29:47,980 --> 02:29:50,440
Why haven't Raju and
Shyam come as yet?

2316
02:29:54,250 --> 02:29:57,289
Now I'll light a lamp
of pure ghee for you.

2317
02:29:57,290 --> 02:29:59,950
"God, please protect me.
God, protect me."

2318
02:29:59,960 --> 02:30:01,158
'Hey, what happened?"

2319
02:30:01,159 --> 02:30:02,960
Did they leave Anuradha
and that small girl?

2320
02:30:02,961 --> 02:30:05,629
I dropped them off and came.
Where is Raju?

2321
02:30:05,630 --> 02:30:07,360
- He has gone to drop Anjali.
- Where?

2322
02:30:07,361 --> 02:30:10,920
Remember those silly guns
in the jeep?

2323
02:30:10,970 --> 02:30:13,630
We had got those weird So
he has gone to do that.

2324
02:30:13,640 --> 02:30:15,970
"We will get 200 or 500. I said,
shut up, scoundrel."

2325
02:30:15,971 --> 02:30:19,039
I don't want dirty money.

2326
02:30:19,040 --> 02:30:21,130
You throw the guns into the sea.
He's gone to throw them.

2327
02:30:21,910 --> 02:30:23,640
'I have always told you, Babu-bhaiya."

2328
02:30:23,650 --> 02:30:25,310
That this Raju will trap us one day.

2329
02:30:25,311 --> 02:30:28,249
"That is right. What you
say is true, come on."

2330
02:30:28,250 --> 02:30:29,980
Today we will keep our hand on...

2331
02:30:29,990 --> 02:30:32,420
'... the lamp and swear, take a swear."

2332
02:30:33,020 --> 02:30:35,989
"Oh the Mighty Lord, we swear
that even if we get even..."

2333
02:30:35,990 --> 02:30:39,259
crore rupees then also we
won't do any wrong deeds.

2334
02:30:39,260 --> 02:30:41,020
We will never do any
more wrong deeds.

2335
02:30:42,600 --> 02:30:44,430
It's gone off.

2336
02:30:44,670 --> 02:30:48,970
"Oh God! We swore even then,
even then it went off."

2337
02:30:49,670 --> 02:30:52,640
So then should we do wrong
deeds or shouldn't we?

2338
02:30:57,010 --> 02:30:58,640
'No, we don't know anything, man."

2339
02:30:59,620 --> 02:31:01,450
Come soon.

2340
02:31:03,020 --> 02:31:04,640
Where is the jeep?

2341
02:31:05,090 --> 02:31:07,490
That Raju has gone in the jeep
with your sister to leave her.

2342
02:31:07,491 --> 02:31:10,089
Did you find those three old guns
that were there in the jeep?

2343
02:31:10,090 --> 02:31:11,790
Yes.

2344
02:31:15,600 --> 02:31:17,530
The one that was made
of excellent wood?

2345
02:31:17,531 --> 02:31:19,029
Yes... yes.

2346
02:31:19,030 --> 02:31:20,368
'The one that was very big, that one?"

2347
02:31:20,369 --> 02:31:21,540
'Yes, yes, yes."

2348
02:31:21,541 --> 02:31:23,639
Was it the one with wonderful
silver on it?

2349
02:31:23,640 --> 02:31:25,109
'Yes, that is the one."

2350
02:31:25,110 --> 02:31:27,070
'No, we have never seen that gun."

2351
02:31:30,710 --> 02:31:33,050
The Parsi from whom I had
stolen the gun who knows...

2352
02:31:33,051 --> 02:31:35,519
from whom all he must
have stolen the gun?

2353
02:31:35,520 --> 02:31:37,719
If it were to be found
it would be wonderful.

2354
02:31:37,720 --> 02:31:39,550
Three crore rupees.

2355
02:31:39,720 --> 02:31:43,490
Three crores?

2356
02:31:44,130 --> 02:31:46,060
"Look in this, look in this.
It's written in..."

2357
02:31:46,061 --> 02:31:49,059
"...English, it's written in English,
look... more than 3 crores."

2358
02:31:49,060 --> 02:31:50,399
'Come on, walk out now."

2359
02:31:50,400 --> 02:31:55,999
"Yes, I'm coming. Looks like
my mobile is in the jeep."

2360
02:31:56,000 --> 02:31:57,138
Did you find it?

2361
02:31:57,139 --> 02:31:58,508
"- I didn't find the mobile, man."

2362
02:31:58,509 --> 02:31:59,970
"Okay, if you find it do
give it to my sister."

2363
02:31:59,980 --> 02:32:03,240
"We are going to jail,
give it to her."

2364
02:32:03,280 --> 02:32:05,770
Listen! What is your mobile number?

2365
02:32:09,750 --> 02:32:12,089
This is around 6-7 crores of booty.

2366
02:32:12,090 --> 02:32:16,250
1.5 crore! 3.5 crores. 5 crores.

2367
02:32:20,300 --> 02:32:21,920
Whose mobile is this?

2368
02:32:29,540 --> 02:32:31,769
'Let me do it, let me do it, man."

2369
02:32:31,770 --> 02:32:33,309
'Hey, you cannot see properly."

2370
02:32:33,310 --> 02:32:35,110
"You are wearing spectacles,
give it to me."

2371
02:32:35,111 --> 02:32:36,640
'Take, take, take."

2372
02:32:36,650 --> 02:32:39,940
"A red phone is lucky
for me, let me dial."

2373
02:32:48,590 --> 02:32:50,850
It got connected.

2374
02:32:51,730 --> 02:32:54,090
'This Raju, Raju, where are you?"

2375
02:32:54,530 --> 02:32:57,960
'Raju, where... in the beauty parlour?"

2376
02:32:58,730 --> 02:33:00,800
"Jerk, what are you doing
in the beauty parlour?"

2377
02:33:00,801 --> 02:33:02,569
He is a donkey!

2378
02:33:02,570 --> 02:33:04,230
You are Rani speaking.

2379
02:33:05,170 --> 02:33:07,730
Why did you pick it up if it's
a wrong number?

2380
02:33:09,810 --> 02:33:11,970
Why was there no sound of
it falling in the water?

2381
02:33:42,840 --> 02:33:44,610
'It's connected, connected."

2382
02:33:47,850 --> 02:33:49,940
- It connected.
- What happened?

2383
02:33:57,260 --> 02:33:59,620
'Raju, Raju, pick up the phone, Raju."

2384
02:33:59,860 --> 02:34:02,830
'Hey Raju, pick the phone up. Raju!"

2385
02:34:05,730 --> 02:34:07,630
What are you doing?

2386
02:34:11,270 --> 02:34:14,240
- "Pick it up, Raju.
- Pick it up!"

2387
02:34:22,150 --> 02:34:23,880
"Raju, it's a question
of 3 crores, Raju."

2388
02:34:23,890 --> 02:34:25,549
Pick up the phone.

2389
02:34:25,550 --> 02:34:30,289
"Hey Lord, pick up, not me, tell
Raju to pick up his phone."

2390
02:34:30,290 --> 02:34:33,390
"Pick up the phone, Raju,
pick the phone up."

2391
02:34:33,400 --> 02:34:35,060
'Oh God, pick it up."

2392
