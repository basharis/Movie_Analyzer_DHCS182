1
00:00:07,567 --> 00:00:09,407
Why didn't you go with them?

2
00:00:09,487 --> 00:00:13,007
Because I want this whole
damned ship to turn back.

3
00:00:14,487 --> 00:00:18,487
Don't mess with me.
I'll do what I like around here.

4
00:00:22,527 --> 00:00:24,487
Just keep the engine running.

5
00:00:39,287 --> 00:00:40,607
Those bastards!

6
00:00:43,367 --> 00:00:47,007
Suddenly they were all there
with their rifles.

7
00:00:50,367 --> 00:00:55,007
I told you all along they were no good.
They'll never make it out of here.

8
00:00:55,127 --> 00:00:57,727
There's only three of us left.
You, me and Cholo.

9
00:00:57,807 --> 00:00:59,087
What, him?

10
00:01:01,127 --> 00:01:04,487
Now we really need some Italian opera.

11
00:01:04,607 --> 00:01:06,367
Don't you agree?

12
00:02:50,967 --> 00:02:54,047
That's the end of it.
The dream is over.

13
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,447
Can you turn here?

14
00:03:04,527 --> 00:03:07,207
A bit narrow, but it'll work.

15
00:03:19,447 --> 00:03:21,207
It won't work.

16
00:03:24,207 --> 00:03:25,807
Did you say something?

17
00:03:27,047 --> 00:03:28,367
Turn around.

18
00:03:31,207 --> 00:03:32,887
Do you see what I see?

19
00:03:34,327 --> 00:03:36,607
Just what we needed.

20
00:03:37,207 --> 00:03:39,887
Breaking through there
would be the end of us.

21
00:03:40,527 --> 00:03:43,567
There's just one way to go...
straight ahead.

22
00:03:45,647 --> 00:03:48,567
You better pull ashore.

23
00:03:50,007 --> 00:03:53,127
Go down to the engine room,
very casually.

24
00:03:58,887 --> 00:04:02,887
They're armed...
with bows and arrows.

25
00:04:04,447 --> 00:04:07,487
But they're keeping their distance.
Ever seen this before?

26
00:04:08,007 --> 00:04:09,687
No, never.

27
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:21,727
Damn it, now they are
blocking the way.

28
00:04:55,687 --> 00:04:57,407
Are they still there?

29
00:04:57,607 --> 00:05:02,367
Even more of them now.
Maybe a hundred canoes.

30
00:05:02,967 --> 00:05:05,287
Give me a shout when the fun begins.

31
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:08,887
I wanna brighten up my last hour
with a little fireworks.

32
00:05:44,207 --> 00:05:46,967
Brethren, what time is it, anyway?

33
00:05:47,127 --> 00:05:51,487
Over here, bare-asses,
I'll pour you a beer.

34
00:05:51,607 --> 00:05:54,567
Hurry up, I'll buy you a drink.

35
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:55,927
Where did you come from?

36
00:05:56,007 --> 00:05:59,567
I just had a nap. Have the others quit?

37
00:06:03,887 --> 00:06:05,207
Shut up!

38
00:10:49,647 --> 00:10:51,207
What do they say?

39
00:10:51,327 --> 00:10:53,207
They're talking about our ship...

40
00:10:53,327 --> 00:10:58,567
...the "white vessel" from which
they expect the promised salvation.

41
00:10:58,647 --> 00:11:02,967
They say there's a curse
weighing on the entire land.

42
00:11:04,127 --> 00:11:08,287
They know that we are not gods,
but the ship has really impressed them.

43
00:11:08,407 --> 00:11:12,127
But why do they play the flute?
What is happening?

44
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:27,687
My friends, I think we will continue.

45
00:12:23,727 --> 00:12:26,167
See the red cliff on the right hand side?

46
00:12:26,247 --> 00:12:27,607
Yes, I see it.

47
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:29,927
That must be it.

48
00:12:30,567 --> 00:12:35,647
Good. We can't go much further,
or we'll run onto a sandbank.

49
00:12:37,127 --> 00:12:39,327
That slope may look insignificant...

50
00:12:39,687 --> 00:12:41,607
...but it's gonna be my destiny.

51
00:12:59,207 --> 00:13:01,847
Come on, follow me!

52
00:13:06,567 --> 00:13:08,927
Now he's showing his cards.

53
00:13:33,367 --> 00:13:34,847
This is it.

54
00:13:39,687 --> 00:13:41,527
This is what we were looking for.

55
00:13:42,207 --> 00:13:44,687
Here? This?

56
00:13:45,607 --> 00:13:51,247
Do we have to climb a tree
for you dimwits to understand?

57
00:13:51,327 --> 00:13:54,807
We'll build a nice platform
for the gentlemen. Up there.

58
00:14:18,247 --> 00:14:20,487
I can hardly believe it.

59
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:23,967
There. There's the Ucayali.

60
00:14:25,967 --> 00:14:29,087
All the river above the
Pongo das Mortes belongs to us.

61
00:14:29,207 --> 00:14:32,887
I know, I know.
We'll make a railway tunnel.

62
00:14:32,967 --> 00:14:34,007
No.

63
00:14:35,367 --> 00:14:38,007
We're going to drag that
ship over the mountain.

64
00:14:38,207 --> 00:14:40,607
And the bare-asses
are going to help us.

65
00:14:40,967 --> 00:14:43,207
How the hell are we going to do that?

66
00:14:43,327 --> 00:14:45,727
Just like the cow jumped
over the moon.

67
00:14:46,247 --> 00:14:48,007
I like this.

68
00:14:51,447 --> 00:14:52,727
Count me in.

69
00:15:02,647 --> 00:15:03,647
Come in.

70
00:15:09,527 --> 00:15:10,607
What is it?

71
00:15:10,727 --> 00:15:13,447
I still don't understand
what you've got in mind.

72
00:15:14,967 --> 00:15:16,487
Come in. I'll show you.

73
00:15:24,207 --> 00:15:25,407
This...

74
00:15:26,687 --> 00:15:28,727
...is the Amazon.

75
00:15:30,247 --> 00:15:31,727
Here is Iquitos.

76
00:15:33,247 --> 00:15:34,647
This...

77
00:15:36,487 --> 00:15:38,967
...is the Ucayali.

78
00:15:41,007 --> 00:15:42,007
Right?

79
00:15:43,087 --> 00:15:44,287
And here...

80
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:50,367
...this is the Pachitea.

81
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:58,327
So, first we went up the Amazon...

82
00:15:59,567 --> 00:16:02,127
...and then up the Pachitea.

83
00:16:02,247 --> 00:16:04,287
We are here right now...

84
00:16:05,327 --> 00:16:09,647
...and we'll drag the ship
over this mountain.

85
00:16:10,167 --> 00:16:11,327
Exactly there.

86
00:16:14,007 --> 00:16:18,047
From here to here
we'll operate the ship...

87
00:16:18,127 --> 00:16:21,527
...to collect rubber from
thousands of workers.

88
00:16:21,607 --> 00:16:24,287
Why didn't we move up the Ucayali?

89
00:16:24,927 --> 00:16:27,327
Because of the Pongo das Mortes.

90
00:16:27,527 --> 00:16:31,367
Nobody will ever make it
through those rapids.

91
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:36,007
Yes, but how do you get the rubber
to Iquitos? We need another ship.

92
00:16:36,327 --> 00:16:40,567
We'll carry it back over the mountain
and build a settlement there.

93
00:16:40,647 --> 00:16:45,967
Soon we'll be so rich we'll have all
the ships we need to take it to Iquitos.

94
00:16:48,567 --> 00:16:51,527
- I've explained our project to the Chief.
- What's his answer?

95
00:16:51,647 --> 00:16:53,167
He just says yes.

96
00:19:15,407 --> 00:19:16,767
More to the left.

97
00:19:18,287 --> 00:19:19,407
A little more.

98
00:19:19,967 --> 00:19:20,887
Stop!

99
00:19:21,567 --> 00:19:23,367
Again, a bit more to the left.

100
00:19:25,327 --> 00:19:26,447
A little more.

101
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:28,167
Stop!

102
00:19:29,927 --> 00:19:31,407
Yes, yes!

103
00:19:35,687 --> 00:19:39,207
T-square at 42 degrees.

104
00:20:11,847 --> 00:20:13,567
Not a bad start, was it?

105
00:20:13,687 --> 00:20:14,647
Right.

106
00:20:16,687 --> 00:20:20,127
There are even children here.
It's a good sign.

107
00:20:31,407 --> 00:20:32,767
What do you think, Paul...

108
00:20:32,887 --> 00:20:35,407
...will the Indians stick with us?

109
00:20:35,487 --> 00:20:37,727
You can't tell what they really think.

110
00:20:37,807 --> 00:20:41,407
But how the hell are we gonna
get that ship over the hill?

111
00:20:43,127 --> 00:20:47,087
If nothing else works,
then we'll make a tunnel.

112
00:20:47,847 --> 00:20:49,487
I could even do it alone...

113
00:20:50,247 --> 00:20:52,407
...if we had a perfect pulley system.

114
00:20:54,847 --> 00:20:58,247
But I would need ten miles of rope
and it would take me ten weeks...

115
00:20:58,367 --> 00:21:00,327
...to pull the ship ten inches.

116
00:21:00,447 --> 00:21:03,007
Unfortunately, we haven't
got that much time.

117
00:21:03,167 --> 00:21:06,207
We have seven more months
before the option runs out.

118
00:21:06,487 --> 00:21:09,967
We have a winch and the
strength of hundreds of Indians.

119
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:12,967
We are going to drag this ship
over the mountain.

120
00:21:44,847 --> 00:21:46,607
Who are your little friends?

121
00:21:47,487 --> 00:21:50,447
McNamara, he's my footman.

122
00:21:50,527 --> 00:21:52,967
And this is el comandante.

123
00:21:53,287 --> 00:21:56,367
Here's to you, McNamara.

124
00:22:47,887 --> 00:22:50,487
This is much steeper than we thought.

125
00:22:52,207 --> 00:22:54,047
Now, with the trees cut down...

126
00:22:55,487 --> 00:22:57,727
...you can really see how steep it is.

127
00:22:58,927 --> 00:23:02,567
We have to level the ground,
build a ramp.

128
00:23:03,967 --> 00:23:08,927
And up there we'll have to make
a cut through to the top.

129
00:23:09,447 --> 00:23:11,567
That could take months.

130
00:23:11,687 --> 00:23:12,847
Dynamite!

131
00:23:13,047 --> 00:23:14,967
I hope we have enough dynamite.

132
00:23:15,087 --> 00:23:17,247
Careful, that'll frighten the bare-asses.

133
00:23:18,127 --> 00:23:19,847
We have no choice.

134
00:24:16,967 --> 00:24:19,207
Take cover! Get back!

135
00:24:19,327 --> 00:24:21,527
Watch out! Danger!

136
00:24:28,127 --> 00:24:31,527
Hold it, hold it! Where are you going?

137
00:24:32,487 --> 00:24:35,567
Now go back to work, come on.

138
00:27:01,727 --> 00:27:04,327
Those logs up there.
Huerequeque, come here.

139
00:27:09,287 --> 00:27:13,087
How can this trunk withstand
the pull of hundreds of tons?

140
00:27:13,167 --> 00:27:17,247
It will. See how deep we have
anchored it in the ground.

141
00:27:18,687 --> 00:27:20,127
As tough as iron.

142
00:27:21,407 --> 00:27:22,807
Bring it down here!

143
00:27:41,607 --> 00:27:43,087
Huerequeque, come with me.

144
00:29:54,407 --> 00:29:55,567
Go on.

145
00:29:57,967 --> 00:29:59,127
Slowly.

146
00:30:00,287 --> 00:30:02,447
If we had known that you planned...

147
00:30:02,527 --> 00:30:06,007
...to move the boat on railway tracks...

148
00:30:06,527 --> 00:30:09,247
...I could have told you to
leave the tracks right there...

149
00:30:09,327 --> 00:30:11,247
...back at your Amazon station.

150
00:30:19,807 --> 00:30:22,247
Sorry I can't help you.

151
00:30:22,527 --> 00:30:24,927
I had a bit too much to drink yesterday.

152
00:30:46,927 --> 00:30:49,247
Shouldn't we tell him that it
melts away to nothing?

153
00:30:49,327 --> 00:30:52,407
Doesn't work. There's no
word for ice in their language.

154
00:31:34,687 --> 00:31:36,207
Come on, get out of there!

155
00:31:36,287 --> 00:31:37,607
Out! Out!

156
00:31:39,807 --> 00:31:41,527
Give it a go!

157
00:32:42,847 --> 00:32:44,287
Give it all you got!

158
00:32:50,167 --> 00:32:52,087
I'll be damned...
It's working.

159
00:32:52,887 --> 00:32:54,127
It's moving.

160
00:32:54,887 --> 00:32:57,087
- It's moving!
- It's moving!

161
00:33:08,447 --> 00:33:09,647
Watch out!

162
00:35:46,847 --> 00:35:50,167
They've been staring at the river for
two days and two nights now.

163
00:35:50,887 --> 00:35:53,407
I'm sure it's because of
the terrible accident.

164
00:35:53,567 --> 00:35:56,127
I can't get anything out of them.

165
00:36:15,607 --> 00:36:16,567
And?

166
00:36:17,487 --> 00:36:18,567
They're gone.

167
00:36:18,687 --> 00:36:22,207
All of them?
They've really disappeared?

168
00:36:22,607 --> 00:36:24,447
What do you make of this?

169
00:36:24,927 --> 00:36:27,887
I had this strange feeling,
so I went outside.

170
00:36:28,247 --> 00:36:32,207
Not a soul, nothing.
They've all disappeared.

171
00:36:32,367 --> 00:36:34,087
That can mean anything.

172
00:36:34,207 --> 00:36:37,447
It could mean that they'll attack us.

173
00:36:37,847 --> 00:36:41,607
But the boy is still here.
My footman, McNamara.

174
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:45,087
For that he'll be made Chief one day.

175
00:37:36,127 --> 00:37:39,527
They're back as if they'd
never been gone.

176
00:37:43,447 --> 00:37:46,287
Don't ask me for an explanation.

177
00:38:05,967 --> 00:38:09,087
I can't believe this crazy thing
Huerequeque has thought up.

178
00:38:10,367 --> 00:38:15,327
Amigos, the engine is running.
Now that's what I call brainwork.

179
00:38:15,407 --> 00:38:16,487
All you do is drink!

180
00:38:16,607 --> 00:38:21,167
We could start up the engine and
drive the anchor winch off of it.

181
00:38:21,247 --> 00:38:26,127
That way the ship will pull itself up
the mountain under it's own steam.

182
00:40:10,847 --> 00:40:12,247
Now, what do you say to that?

183
00:40:12,367 --> 00:40:15,007
There are times when a peasant's
brain is good for something.

184
00:40:15,127 --> 00:40:16,687
You ain't no peasant!

185
00:40:16,767 --> 00:40:19,847
You're the finest drunkard ever
to stagger over this earth.

186
00:40:20,127 --> 00:40:21,927
- But we forgot something.
- What?

187
00:40:22,007 --> 00:40:24,647
Enrico! Enrico Caruso!

188
00:42:09,807 --> 00:42:11,447
Why are they doing all this?

189
00:42:13,367 --> 00:42:15,967
Why are they working like dogs for us?

190
00:42:18,207 --> 00:42:19,127
Why?

191
00:42:20,727 --> 00:42:22,367
Why? Why?

192
00:42:23,447 --> 00:42:24,767
Why?

193
00:42:26,807 --> 00:42:30,647
- Why?
- No, I don't know either.

194
00:42:31,087 --> 00:42:34,607
The only thing I know is that
there must be a reason for it.

195
00:42:34,687 --> 00:42:38,167
They're planning something, I bet.

196
00:42:51,447 --> 00:42:53,127
You must drink it.

197
00:42:53,407 --> 00:42:56,127
It is yucca.
Yucca with fermented saliva.

198
00:42:56,247 --> 00:42:57,647
Go on, drink!

199
00:42:57,727 --> 00:43:01,487
My God, time is flying
and we are getting nowhere.

200
00:45:34,207 --> 00:45:35,687
Something's up.

201
00:45:35,807 --> 00:45:39,527
The men are preparing barbasco,
a very strong poison.

202
00:45:39,647 --> 00:45:42,287
And they are painted black.

203
00:45:44,247 --> 00:45:47,807
But most of the men have hidden in the
woods and have armed themselves.

204
00:46:00,607 --> 00:46:02,047
What does that mean?

205
00:46:02,167 --> 00:46:05,567
As far as I know, the paint is
supposed to make them invisible.

206
00:46:05,687 --> 00:46:10,847
They only do that when they go
hunting or when they go to war.

207
00:46:13,407 --> 00:46:16,207
Let's return to the ship,
load our rifles.

208
00:46:16,287 --> 00:46:18,527
We wouldn't stand a chance.

209
00:46:35,407 --> 00:46:38,327
It seems to me that they
are planning something.

210
00:46:38,407 --> 00:46:44,127
And I fear that we four will soon
end up as shrunken heads.

211
00:46:45,367 --> 00:46:47,607
I think we're safe for the moment.

212
00:46:48,087 --> 00:46:49,727
How do you know?

213
00:46:50,167 --> 00:46:52,247
There is a sign.

214
00:46:53,247 --> 00:46:54,167
Look...

215
00:46:55,327 --> 00:46:57,367
See those hands on the railing?

216
00:56:31,247 --> 00:56:32,527
What has happened?

217
00:56:34,127 --> 00:56:38,127
The Pongo! We're drifting into
the Pongo! Cholo!

218
00:56:50,087 --> 00:56:51,087
Cholo!

219
00:56:51,887 --> 00:56:54,327
Paul! Cholo!

220
00:56:54,447 --> 00:56:56,247
I must stop the ship!

221
00:57:03,687 --> 00:57:06,847
Start the fire!
We're drifting into the Pongo!

222
00:57:06,927 --> 00:57:08,527
The valves first!

223
00:57:39,007 --> 00:57:41,207
For God's sake, my ship!

224
00:57:58,847 --> 00:57:59,927
Damn it.

225
00:58:00,127 --> 00:58:01,887
Now it's too late.

226
01:01:17,967 --> 01:01:19,447
Do you know what he says?

227
01:01:19,527 --> 01:01:22,807
He says they untied the boat last night.

228
01:01:22,887 --> 01:01:26,367
They knew all along the divine vessel
was only dragged over the mountain...

229
01:01:26,487 --> 01:01:28,567
...so that it could drift
through the rapids.

230
01:01:28,687 --> 01:01:33,247
It had to be done to soothe
the evil spirits of the rapids.

231
01:01:33,327 --> 01:01:35,567
I must stop my ship.

232
01:03:06,447 --> 01:03:09,367
First of all, have a drink.

233
01:03:09,447 --> 01:03:13,087
Running the Pongo das Mortes
with a steamship...

234
01:03:13,167 --> 01:03:16,207
...is a record that will
never be repeated.

235
01:03:16,287 --> 01:03:17,887
Here, have a drink.

236
01:03:19,487 --> 01:03:23,927
Wonderful, gentlemen.
Quite spectacular.

237
01:03:25,127 --> 01:03:29,047
Here's to the reconciliation
of the evil spirits of the Pongo.

238
01:03:40,887 --> 01:03:42,967
I'll tell you a story.

239
01:03:44,367 --> 01:03:47,047
At the time when North America
was hardly explored...

240
01:03:47,607 --> 01:03:51,087
...one of those early French trappers
went westward from Montreal...

241
01:03:53,487 --> 01:03:56,647
...and he was the first white man
to set eyes on Niagara Falls.

242
01:03:58,527 --> 01:04:03,447
When he returned, he told of waterfalls
that were more vast and immense...

243
01:04:03,527 --> 01:04:05,927
...than people had ever dreamed of.

244
01:04:07,487 --> 01:04:09,127
But no one believed him.

245
01:04:09,567 --> 01:04:11,847
They thought he was
a madman or a liar.

246
01:04:13,887 --> 01:04:16,087
They asked him, "What's your proof?"

247
01:04:17,887 --> 01:04:19,487
And he answered...

248
01:04:22,207 --> 01:04:23,607
"My proof is...

249
01:04:25,927 --> 01:04:27,647
...that I have seen them."

250
01:04:37,087 --> 01:04:38,327
Sorry.

251
01:04:39,247 --> 01:04:41,767
I don't really know what that's
got to do with me.

252
01:04:47,647 --> 01:04:49,207
What will you do next?

253
01:04:50,287 --> 01:04:51,487
I don't know.

254
01:04:52,127 --> 01:04:57,287
I'm asking because I'm interested
in buying the boat back.

255
01:04:57,527 --> 01:05:00,487
My business has been
expanding lately.

256
01:05:01,247 --> 01:05:04,167
The damage could be repaired
in a few days.

257
01:05:04,327 --> 01:05:09,527
Oh, I assure you, I don't mean to
exploit your delicate situation.

258
01:05:11,327 --> 01:05:17,687
I just heard, that a European opera
ensemble has arrived in Manaus...

259
01:05:17,767 --> 01:05:20,247
...to give a guest performance there.

260
01:05:20,367 --> 01:05:22,687
Perhaps you should go there.

261
01:05:22,847 --> 01:05:27,287
They are performing an opera of this
fantastic German composer.

262
01:05:27,727 --> 01:05:29,727
One of the very modern ones.

263
01:05:29,847 --> 01:05:34,647
Federico, Roberto... Ricardo...
What's his name, Ricardo...?

264
01:05:34,767 --> 01:05:35,927
Wagner?

265
01:05:36,247 --> 01:05:37,967
He's the one who wrote Parsifal.

266
01:05:38,367 --> 01:05:39,567
Yes, I guess that's the one.

267
01:05:39,767 --> 01:05:41,967
Very Teutonic, his music.

268
01:05:42,047 --> 01:05:44,927
And the name of the Opera
is "The Puritans".

269
01:05:45,527 --> 01:05:48,407
No, no, that's an Italian opera, by Bellini.

270
01:05:53,887 --> 01:05:55,167
Tell me...

271
01:05:57,647 --> 01:05:59,567
...did you mean that about the boat?

272
01:06:02,527 --> 01:06:06,127
Hey, Cholo, Huerequeque,
come over here!

273
01:06:08,687 --> 01:06:09,847
Come on.

274
01:06:12,447 --> 01:06:15,927
Paul, this is the new
owner of the Molly Aida.

275
01:06:16,007 --> 01:06:18,487
But we still have the
ship for two more weeks.

276
01:06:19,167 --> 01:06:21,887
Paul, listen.

277
01:06:23,807 --> 01:06:26,527
You'll travel to Manaus
with all this money.

278
01:06:27,687 --> 01:06:31,327
You'll bring back a tailcoat and
the best cigar in the world.

279
01:06:32,527 --> 01:06:35,927
And from the theater I want
an armchair with red velvet upholstery.

280
01:06:36,007 --> 01:06:39,447
I have to keep a promise to a pig
that loves Caruso so much.

281
01:06:43,407 --> 01:06:46,287
And then...
