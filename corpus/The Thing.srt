1
00:05:15,992 --> 00:05:18,536
Your move: Bishop to knight four.

2
00:05:18,745 --> 00:05:21,373
My move: Knight to rook three.

3
00:05:22,257 --> 00:05:25,377
Poor baby, you're starting
to lose it, aren't ya?

4
00:05:31,299 --> 00:05:33,843
Your move: King to rook one.

5
00:05:34,244 --> 00:05:36,805
My move: Rook to knight six.

6
00:05:37,389 --> 00:05:39,682
Checkmate. Checkmate.

7
00:05:45,021 --> 00:05:47,015
You cheating bitch.

8
00:06:50,512 --> 00:06:54,182
- Childs, what's he doing?
- Circling the camp.

9
00:06:55,558 --> 00:06:57,285
Who is he?

10
00:06:57,385 --> 00:07:00,889
- Said "Norge" or something on the side.
- It's Norwegian.

11
00:09:05,763 --> 00:09:07,373
- George, are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm okay.

12
00:09:07,473 --> 00:09:10,059
- Are you?
- Yeah. What's going on there?

13
00:09:32,332 --> 00:09:33,625
Watch it.

14
00:09:58,566 --> 00:09:59,634
Easy.

15
00:09:59,734 --> 00:10:03,237
Easy, easy, easy. Yes.

16
00:10:15,792 --> 00:10:18,002
First goddamn week of winter.

17
00:10:27,929 --> 00:10:32,266
Oh, come on. Four stitches.
Barely grazed you.

18
00:10:33,601 --> 00:10:38,147
What were they doing flying that low,
shooting at a dog, at us?

19
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:42,360
Stir-crazy. Cabin fever. Who knows?

20
00:10:43,152 --> 00:10:47,532
U.S. Number 31, calling McMurdo.
Come in. Over.

21
00:10:49,951 --> 00:10:54,288
U.S. Number 31, calling McMurdo.
Urgent. Come in. Over.

22
00:10:56,374 --> 00:10:57,583
Great.

23
00:10:57,959 --> 00:11:00,445
- Come on, come on.
- Nobody!

24
00:11:00,545 --> 00:11:02,363
Nobody. Get a hold of somebody.

25
00:11:02,463 --> 00:11:04,866
Get a hold of anybody.
We gotta report this mess.

26
00:11:04,966 --> 00:11:07,994
Look, I haven't been able to reach shit
in two weeks.

27
00:11:08,094 --> 00:11:11,331
I doubt if anybody's talked to anybody
on this entire continent,

28
00:11:11,431 --> 00:11:13,266
and you want me to reach somebody!

29
00:11:25,069 --> 00:11:26,988
Maybe we're at war with Norway.

30
00:11:31,659 --> 00:11:36,539
I was wondering when the El Capitan
was gonna get a chance to use his popgun.

31
00:11:40,585 --> 00:11:44,030
- How long have they been stationed there?
- It says here only eight weeks.

32
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:46,032
Well, that's not long enough
for guys to go bonkers.

33
00:11:46,132 --> 00:11:49,744
Bullshit, bwana. Five minutes is enough
to put a man over down here.

34
00:11:49,844 --> 00:11:50,870
Damn straight.

35
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:54,640
I mean, look at Palmer.
He been the way he is since the first day.

36
00:11:55,057 --> 00:11:56,642
How many in their party?

37
00:11:57,059 --> 00:11:59,353
They started with 10.
There'd be eight others left.

38
00:11:59,687 --> 00:12:03,257
How do we know? Guys as crazy as that
could have done a lot of damage

39
00:12:03,357 --> 00:12:04,759
to their own before they got to us.

40
00:12:04,859 --> 00:12:07,637
- Nothing we can do about that.
- Yes, there is. I wanna go up.

41
00:12:07,737 --> 00:12:09,430
- In this weather?
- Bennings?

42
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:11,683
Winds are gonna let up a tad
next couple of hours.

43
00:12:11,783 --> 00:12:13,242
A tad?

44
00:12:13,493 --> 00:12:17,205
Can't condone it much myself,
but it is a short haul.

45
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:19,999
An hour there, an hour back.

46
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:24,278
Shit, Doc, I'll give you the lift.
No problem.

47
00:12:24,378 --> 00:12:28,257
- Forget it, Palmer.
- Hey, thanks for thinking about it though.

48
00:12:32,136 --> 00:12:34,806
Loaded with kerosene. I count 15 cans.

49
00:12:35,723 --> 00:12:38,017
MacReady! Mac, get your gear on!

50
00:12:48,945 --> 00:12:51,139
- Mac, it may not clear up for a week.
- Yeah.

51
00:12:51,239 --> 00:12:53,599
- We're the closest ones to them.
- It's all right by me, Doc.

52
00:12:53,699 --> 00:12:56,561
I'm just letting you know
we're taking a chance.

53
00:12:56,661 --> 00:12:58,020
Quit the griping, MacReady.

54
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,481
Those clouds keep moving over the sun,
we're gonna get a whiteout.

55
00:13:00,581 --> 00:13:02,900
We get caught in that,
you can scratch one doctor and one pilot.

56
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,753
This is real thin.
It'll clear as soon as you get up.

57
00:13:08,673 --> 00:13:12,093
It's up to you, Mac.
If you don't wanna fly, we don't fly.

58
00:13:13,594 --> 00:13:15,288
You really wanna save
those crazy Swedes, huh?

59
00:13:15,388 --> 00:13:16,414
Norwegians.

60
00:13:16,514 --> 00:13:18,499
- Which way, Doc?
- Southwest.

61
00:13:18,599 --> 00:13:21,502
You're gonna have to read the map.
'Cause I'm gonna be busy.

62
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:30,386
Mac's really taking it up, huh?

63
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,948
He knows what he's doing.

64
00:14:36,344 --> 00:14:38,246
Nauls, will you turn that crap down?

65
00:14:38,346 --> 00:14:41,182
I'm trying to get some sleep.
I was shot today.

66
00:14:42,516 --> 00:14:44,268
Read, bwana. Will do.

67
00:14:46,354 --> 00:14:48,981
Writing's on the wall

68
00:14:51,317 --> 00:14:53,903
Very superstitious

69
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:11,540
Anybody there?

70
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:14,318
Hey, Sweden!

71
00:17:14,418 --> 00:17:17,338
They're not Swedish, Mac. They're Norwegian.

72
00:18:41,172 --> 00:18:42,256
Mac!

73
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:20,878
My God. What the hell happened here?

74
00:19:23,088 --> 00:19:24,590
Come on, Doc.

75
00:20:03,345 --> 00:20:08,008
- Portable video unit. Anything?
- It's all in Norwegian.

76
00:20:14,181 --> 00:20:16,041
What are you doing, Doc?

77
00:20:16,141 --> 00:20:17,835
Could be important work.
I wanna take it back.

78
00:20:17,935 --> 00:20:20,421
Well, it's getting late. Let's hurry it up.

79
00:20:20,521 --> 00:20:22,606
I'll check out the last few rooms.

80
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,419
Hey, Copper, come here!

81
00:21:26,754 --> 00:21:28,489
Maybe they found a fossil,

82
00:21:28,589 --> 00:21:31,408
the remains of some animal buried
in the ice, and they chopped it out.

83
00:21:31,508 --> 00:21:33,761
- But where is it?
- Look at this.

84
00:21:48,275 --> 00:21:49,777
What is that?

85
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,822
Is that a man in there or something?

86
00:21:55,783 --> 00:21:58,786
Whatever it is, they burned it up in a hurry.

87
00:22:00,829 --> 00:22:02,956
Help me find a shovel, Doc.

88
00:22:59,012 --> 00:23:00,556
We found this.

89
00:23:01,473 --> 00:23:02,933
Jesus Christ.

90
00:23:28,375 --> 00:23:31,670
Blair, I'd like you to start
an autopsy right away.

91
00:24:32,898 --> 00:24:34,591
Did you reach anybody yet?

92
00:24:34,691 --> 00:24:38,011
Reach anybody?
We're a thousand miles from nowhere, man,

93
00:24:38,111 --> 00:24:40,764
and it's gonna get worse
before it gets better.

94
00:24:40,864 --> 00:24:43,617
Well, stick to it, Windows. Stick to it.

95
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:51,900
Nothing wrong with this Norwegian,
physiologically anyway.

96
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,294
No drugs, no alcohol. Nothing.

97
00:25:18,735 --> 00:25:21,597
Well, what we got here
is what appears to be, anyway,

98
00:25:21,697 --> 00:25:24,032
a normal set of internal organs.

99
00:25:26,118 --> 00:25:27,327
Heart,

100
00:25:28,412 --> 00:25:30,789
lungs, kidneys, liver.

101
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,458
Intestines.

102
00:25:37,504 --> 00:25:39,214
Seem to be normal.

103
00:25:56,857 --> 00:25:59,801
One, door number two
and door number three.

104
00:25:59,901 --> 00:26:03,764
And I think that Dawn Screen here
has got the one to trade in the most.

105
00:26:03,864 --> 00:26:05,641
I went to you first.
You brought your friend Anna.

106
00:26:05,741 --> 00:26:08,060
You've been consulting Anna all through
the show anyhow.

107
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,770
You may as well consult her one more time.

108
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:11,872
I know how this one ends.

109
00:26:48,158 --> 00:26:51,453
Clark, will you put this mutt with the others
where he belongs?

110
00:26:54,247 --> 00:26:55,666
Yeah, okay.

111
00:27:16,645 --> 00:27:17,938
Go ahead.

112
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,902
Go ahead. What are you waiting for?

113
00:30:15,448 --> 00:30:18,852
I don't know what the hell's in there,
but it's weird and pissed off, whatever it is.

114
00:30:18,952 --> 00:30:20,353
Bennings, go get Childs.

115
00:30:20,453 --> 00:30:22,664
What is this? What's going on?

116
00:30:22,956 --> 00:30:25,358
- Hey, Palmer, what is this?
- I don't know.

117
00:30:25,458 --> 00:30:28,695
- Childs, Mac wants the flamethrower!
- Mac wants the what?

118
00:30:28,795 --> 00:30:31,423
- That's what he said. Now, move!
- Damn it.

119
00:30:44,644 --> 00:30:46,688
- Stay back.
- Hey, Mac, what is it?

120
00:31:34,402 --> 00:31:37,614
- Don't! No!
- Get away!

121
00:31:37,739 --> 00:31:39,949
Get back! Get back!

122
00:32:04,641 --> 00:32:06,559
Get your ass over here!

123
00:32:08,186 --> 00:32:09,879
Burn it.

124
00:32:13,441 --> 00:32:15,527
Damn it, Childs. Torch it!

125
00:33:37,192 --> 00:33:38,610
Oh, my God.

126
00:33:45,742 --> 00:33:49,037
Oh!

127
00:33:54,667 --> 00:33:57,629
Look. Son of a bitch. Oh.

128
00:34:14,062 --> 00:34:16,256
You see, what we're talking about here
is an organism

129
00:34:16,356 --> 00:34:20,135
that imitates other life-forms,
and it imitates them perfectly.

130
00:34:20,235 --> 00:34:23,696
When this thing attacked our dogs,
it tried to digest them,

131
00:34:23,822 --> 00:34:25,240
absorb them,

132
00:34:26,366 --> 00:34:29,911
and in the process,
shape its own cells to imitate them.

133
00:34:32,205 --> 00:34:36,000
This, for instance... that's not dog.

134
00:34:38,962 --> 00:34:42,215
It's imitation.
We got to it before it had time to finish.

135
00:34:44,425 --> 00:34:45,885
Finish what?

136
00:34:46,928 --> 00:34:49,097
Finish imitating these dogs.

137
00:34:56,229 --> 00:34:59,899
Easy, easy. Good.

138
00:35:02,777 --> 00:35:04,445
Easy, easy.

139
00:35:10,493 --> 00:35:11,936
- Clark.
- Yeah?

140
00:35:12,036 --> 00:35:15,623
Did you notice anything strange
about the dog, anything at all?

141
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:17,250
Strange? No.

142
00:35:19,794 --> 00:35:22,005
What was the dog doing in the rec room?

143
00:35:22,589 --> 00:35:23,823
I don't know.

144
00:35:23,923 --> 00:35:26,301
He was just wandering around camp all day.

145
00:35:28,845 --> 00:35:32,932
Are you saying to me the dog wasn't put
in the kennel until last night?

146
00:35:33,099 --> 00:35:34,267
Right.

147
00:35:36,477 --> 00:35:38,438
How long were you alone with that dog?

148
00:35:38,938 --> 00:35:42,859
I don't know. An hour.
Hour and a half, maybe.

149
00:35:44,986 --> 00:35:47,989
What the hell you looking at me
like that for?

150
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:52,202
- I don't know.
- What?

151
00:35:53,411 --> 00:35:55,455
I don't know. It's probably nothing.

152
00:35:58,708 --> 00:36:00,501
It's nothing at all.

153
00:36:11,304 --> 00:36:13,206
How much more of this crap is there?

154
00:36:13,306 --> 00:36:15,516
Oh, about nine hours, I'd say.

155
00:36:16,935 --> 00:36:20,104
- We can't learn anything from this.
- Guess not.

156
00:36:31,574 --> 00:36:33,493
Where'd they take these shots?

157
00:36:34,577 --> 00:36:36,354
Seems like they were spending
a lot of their time

158
00:36:36,454 --> 00:36:39,149
in a little place northeast of their camp
about five or six miles.

159
00:36:39,249 --> 00:36:40,667
What's that?

160
00:36:42,335 --> 00:36:44,712
It looks like something
buried under the ice.

161
00:36:51,386 --> 00:36:54,180
And look at that.
They're planting thermite charges.

162
00:36:55,181 --> 00:36:58,476
Whatever it was, it was bigger
than that block of ice you found.

163
00:37:08,278 --> 00:37:12,098
Here. This is it. The place where
they were spending most of their time.

164
00:37:12,198 --> 00:37:15,743
- Pretty nasty out, Mac. 35 knots.
- Screw it. I'm gonna go up anyway.

165
00:37:39,726 --> 00:37:41,352
Half a mile due east.

166
00:39:19,659 --> 00:39:22,537
Jesus, how long do you figure
this has been in the ice?

167
00:39:23,871 --> 00:39:27,333
Well, the backscatter effect's been
bringing things up

168
00:39:27,834 --> 00:39:30,445
from way down around here for a long time.

169
00:39:30,545 --> 00:39:35,174
I'd say... I'd say the ice it's buried in is
100,000 years old, at least.

170
00:39:38,428 --> 00:39:40,763
- And those Norwegians blew it up?
- Yeah.

171
00:40:10,543 --> 00:40:11,778
I don't know.

172
00:40:11,878 --> 00:40:15,256
Thousands of years ago, it crashes,
and this thing...

173
00:40:16,382 --> 00:40:20,286
Gets thrown out or crawls out,
and it ends up freezing in the ice.

174
00:40:20,386 --> 00:40:23,097
I just cannot believe
any of this voodoo bullshit.

175
00:40:24,223 --> 00:40:26,893
Childs, it happens all the time, man.

176
00:40:27,518 --> 00:40:30,188
They're falling out of the skies like flies.

177
00:40:30,396 --> 00:40:32,632
Government knows all about it. Right, Mac?

178
00:40:32,732 --> 00:40:35,134
Do you believe
any of this voodoo bullshit, Blair?

179
00:40:35,234 --> 00:40:39,572
Childs. Childs. Chariots Of The Gods, man.

180
00:40:40,531 --> 00:40:42,700
They practically own South America.

181
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:45,536
I mean, they taught the Incas
everything they know.

182
00:40:52,919 --> 00:40:54,195
Come on, now, MacReady.

183
00:40:54,295 --> 00:40:57,698
The Norwegians get a hold of this,
and they dig it up out of the ice.

184
00:40:57,798 --> 00:41:00,243
Yes, Garry, they dig it up.
They cart it back.

185
00:41:00,343 --> 00:41:03,663
It gets thawed out, wakes up,
not in the best of moods.

186
00:41:03,763 --> 00:41:06,332
- I don't know. I wasn't there.
- Which one of you disrespectful men

187
00:41:06,432 --> 00:41:09,936
been tossing his dirty drawers
in the kitchen trash can, huh?

188
00:41:10,353 --> 00:41:13,606
From now on
I want my kitchen clean, germfree.

189
00:41:13,898 --> 00:41:16,968
Now how's this motherfucker wake up
after thousands of years in the ice?

190
00:41:17,068 --> 00:41:19,695
- And how could it look like a dog?
- I don't know how.

191
00:41:20,446 --> 00:41:23,391
'Cause it's different than us, see?
'Cause it's from outer space.

192
00:41:23,491 --> 00:41:25,535
What do you want from me? Ask him.

193
00:41:30,581 --> 00:41:32,708
You buy any of this, Blair?

194
00:43:33,537 --> 00:43:37,291
Mac, removing those things
out of the lab into the storeroom.

195
00:43:37,541 --> 00:43:39,710
Can you come get your stuff?

196
00:43:40,419 --> 00:43:42,380
Be there in a minute, Doc.

197
00:43:59,647 --> 00:44:01,107
Through the door.

198
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:06,654
Right over here. Right over...

199
00:44:10,032 --> 00:44:12,827
Sorry, Mac. You have to move your stuff...

200
00:44:13,285 --> 00:44:16,539
Doc says we gotta lock him up.
Stash him in here and lock him up.

201
00:44:17,206 --> 00:44:19,358
- I have to talk to you.
- I'm tired of talking, Fuchs.

202
00:44:19,458 --> 00:44:21,235
I just wanna get up to my shack
and get drunk.

203
00:44:21,335 --> 00:44:23,796
- Mac, it's important.
- What is it?

204
00:44:25,548 --> 00:44:27,700
- Outside.
- It's 40 below outside.

205
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:29,969
In the Thiokol. Please, Mac.

206
00:44:45,526 --> 00:44:49,989
- We ought to just burn these things.
- Can't burn the find of the century.

207
00:44:50,781 --> 00:44:53,033
That's gonna win somebody the Nobel Prize.

208
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:08,032
You got the keys?

209
00:45:08,132 --> 00:45:11,552
Get them from Garry.
I wanna get some stuff out of here.

210
00:45:45,753 --> 00:45:47,446
There's something wrong with Blair.

211
00:45:47,546 --> 00:45:50,783
He's locked himself in his room,
and he won't answer the door.

212
00:45:50,883 --> 00:45:52,868
So I took one of his notebooks from the lab.

213
00:45:52,968 --> 00:45:54,720
- Yeah?
- Listen.

214
00:45:56,597 --> 00:45:59,667
"It could have imitated
a million life-forms on a million planets.

215
00:45:59,767 --> 00:46:02,044
"Could change into any one of them
at any time.

216
00:46:02,144 --> 00:46:03,421
"Now it wants life-forms on Earth."

217
00:46:03,521 --> 00:46:05,506
It's getting cold in here,
and I haven't slept in days.

218
00:46:05,606 --> 00:46:06,841
Wait.

219
00:46:06,941 --> 00:46:10,886
"It needs to be alone and in close proximity
with a life-form to be absorbed.

220
00:46:10,986 --> 00:46:12,471
"The chameleon strikes in the dark."

221
00:46:12,571 --> 00:46:14,682
- So is Blair cracking up, or what?
- Damn it, MacReady.

222
00:46:14,782 --> 00:46:17,409
"There is still cellular activity
in these burned remains.

223
00:46:17,618 --> 00:46:19,578
"They're not dead yet."

224
00:46:30,673 --> 00:46:33,008
Let's go, Bennings. I gotta get some sleep.

225
00:46:52,653 --> 00:46:54,947
Holy shit.

226
00:46:59,869 --> 00:47:01,453
Go get the doc.

227
00:47:02,788 --> 00:47:05,249
I'll get Garry. We'll meet in Blair's room.

228
00:47:11,714 --> 00:47:13,257
It's Bennings!

229
00:47:23,434 --> 00:47:26,729
Bennings was right there.
Mac, I swear to God. It had a hold of him.

230
00:47:39,575 --> 00:47:42,202
Windows! Windows! Keep away from him!

231
00:47:45,831 --> 00:47:47,625
Get back! Stay back!

232
00:47:51,503 --> 00:47:53,213
It isn't Bennings.

233
00:48:26,622 --> 00:48:28,274
My God, what was happening to him?

234
00:48:28,374 --> 00:48:31,819
If it had more time it would have looked,
sounded and acted like Bennings.

235
00:48:31,919 --> 00:48:33,779
I don't know what you're saying.

236
00:48:33,879 --> 00:48:37,341
That was one of those things out there
trying to imitate him, Garry.

237
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:43,622
- Come on.
- MacReady, I know Bennings.

238
00:48:43,722 --> 00:48:46,684
I've known him for 10 years. He's my friend.

239
00:48:48,477 --> 00:48:50,688
We've gotta burn the rest of them.

240
00:49:24,805 --> 00:49:26,640
All right, step back.

241
00:49:51,665 --> 00:49:53,400
You sure that's all of them?

242
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:57,379
We cleaned out the storehouse, the lab.
There is nothing left.

243
00:49:58,797 --> 00:50:00,340
Where's Blair?

244
00:50:42,049 --> 00:50:43,801
I can't find Blair.

245
00:50:44,968 --> 00:50:46,412
Where's everybody else?

246
00:50:46,512 --> 00:50:48,414
Windows is in the radio room
still trying to get through.

247
00:50:48,514 --> 00:50:50,265
Everyone else is in the rec room.

248
00:50:51,266 --> 00:50:53,352
Well, you go on. I'll be in in a minute.

249
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,617
Blair?

250
00:51:20,043 --> 00:51:21,590
Blair?

251
00:52:20,439 --> 00:52:23,926
Don't! You son of a bitch.
You understand me?

252
00:52:24,026 --> 00:52:27,012
- He's got a gun. Get back.
- Anybody interferes, I'll kill them.

253
00:52:27,112 --> 00:52:29,223
- Jesus.
- Just leave it here. We're gonna talk.

254
00:52:29,323 --> 00:52:30,724
He smashed up some of the chopper
pretty good.

255
00:52:30,824 --> 00:52:32,518
Nobody talk to nobody!

256
00:52:32,618 --> 00:52:34,995
Childs, go see if he got to the tractor.

257
00:52:35,954 --> 00:52:39,124
Nobody gets in and out of here. Nobody.

258
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:49,092
You guys think I'm crazy. Well, that's fine.

259
00:52:50,677 --> 00:52:53,205
Most of you don't know what's going on
around here.

260
00:52:53,305 --> 00:52:57,476
Well, I'm damn well sure some of you do.

261
00:52:58,602 --> 00:52:59,811
Christ.

262
00:53:03,065 --> 00:53:06,860
He got most of the chopper and the tractor,
and he's killed the rest of the dogs.

263
00:53:10,447 --> 00:53:12,658
Garry, wait a minute, wait a minute.

264
00:53:13,450 --> 00:53:17,537
Now, Childs, go around to
the map room door. Talk to him.

265
00:53:18,372 --> 00:53:19,498
Okay.

266
00:53:20,082 --> 00:53:22,501
Norris, get a table from the lab.

267
00:53:25,379 --> 00:53:28,507
Do you think that thing
wanted to be an animal?

268
00:53:28,715 --> 00:53:31,927
No dogs make it a thousand miles
through the cold.

269
00:53:35,097 --> 00:53:37,224
Nah, you don't understand!

270
00:53:38,058 --> 00:53:40,644
That thing wanted to be us.

271
00:53:41,728 --> 00:53:43,005
If the cell gets out

272
00:53:43,105 --> 00:53:45,966
it could imitate everything
on the face of the earth

273
00:53:46,066 --> 00:53:48,568
- and it's not gonna stop!
- Okay, Blair.

274
00:53:49,736 --> 00:53:52,239
Come on, man, you don't wanna hurt anybody.

275
00:53:52,823 --> 00:53:54,116
I'll kill you.

276
00:54:20,517 --> 00:54:22,127
Good shot, MacReady.

277
00:54:22,227 --> 00:54:23,629
- Excuse me.
- Okay.

278
00:54:23,729 --> 00:54:25,856
- All right, bring him up.
- Yeah.

279
00:54:46,084 --> 00:54:47,586
Come on, Blair.

280
00:54:53,592 --> 00:54:55,160
What about your shack?

281
00:54:55,260 --> 00:54:58,597
I don't want him in my shack.
We'll lock him in the toolshed.

282
00:55:02,809 --> 00:55:06,396
- Why am I in here?
- For your own protection, Blair.

283
00:55:21,495 --> 00:55:23,121
How you doing, old boy?

284
00:55:27,167 --> 00:55:29,211
I don't know who to trust.

285
00:55:30,962 --> 00:55:33,131
I know what you mean, Blair.

286
00:55:34,716 --> 00:55:37,636
Trust's a tough thing to come by these days.

287
00:55:39,221 --> 00:55:42,140
Tell you what.
Why don't you just trust in the Lord?

288
00:55:45,018 --> 00:55:47,979
- Watch Clark.
- What?

289
00:55:49,481 --> 00:55:52,317
I said, watch Clark.

290
00:55:53,151 --> 00:55:55,654
And watch him close. Do you hear me?

291
00:56:14,089 --> 00:56:16,091
And now the radio's gone.

292
00:56:16,341 --> 00:56:19,244
- And so are the choppers.
- We're completely cut off.

293
00:56:19,344 --> 00:56:22,914
All we can do now is hole up
'til spring, wait for the rescue team.

294
00:56:23,014 --> 00:56:24,683
No, we don't wait.

295
00:56:25,267 --> 00:56:27,669
Somebody in this camp
ain't what he appears to be.

296
00:56:27,769 --> 00:56:31,214
Right now that may be one or two of us.
By spring, it could be all of us.

297
00:56:31,314 --> 00:56:33,525
So how do we know who's human?

298
00:56:34,568 --> 00:56:37,529
If I was an imitation, a perfect imitation,

299
00:56:38,029 --> 00:56:40,699
how would you know if it was really me?

300
00:56:46,663 --> 00:56:48,440
Is there some kind of test, Doc?

301
00:56:48,540 --> 00:56:52,711
Well, yeah, possibly.
I've been thinking about a blood serum test.

302
00:56:52,878 --> 00:56:54,296
What's that?

303
00:56:54,504 --> 00:56:59,384
We could take a sample of each person's
blood, mix it with uncontaminated blood.

304
00:56:59,759 --> 00:57:02,746
I suppose if there's a reaction,
we'd know who isn't human.

305
00:57:02,846 --> 00:57:06,475
- We've got whole blood in storage.
- Start working on it.

306
00:57:07,058 --> 00:57:08,852
Keep an eye on Clark.

307
00:57:09,311 --> 00:57:11,313
He was close to that dog.

308
00:57:12,063 --> 00:57:13,690
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

309
00:57:18,653 --> 00:57:23,058
Mac, we need Blair's help.
He's the only one who knows this organism.

310
00:57:23,158 --> 00:57:24,476
He's too far gone.

311
00:57:24,576 --> 00:57:27,829
But get the rest of his notebooks.
Start going through them.

312
00:57:40,175 --> 00:57:42,719
Garry! Hey, you guys, come here!

313
00:57:45,013 --> 00:57:47,999
- What?
- Somebody got to the blood.

314
00:57:48,099 --> 00:57:49,226
What?

315
00:57:49,809 --> 00:57:51,937
- Where's Clark?
- Right here.

316
00:57:52,437 --> 00:57:56,107
- Wait a minute. Was this broken into?
- The lock is undamaged.

317
00:57:56,441 --> 00:57:58,760
Somebody opened it, closed it,
then locked it.

318
00:57:58,860 --> 00:57:59,886
Great.

319
00:57:59,986 --> 00:58:01,905
Who's got access to it?

320
00:58:06,618 --> 00:58:08,620
I guess I'm the only one.

321
00:58:08,954 --> 00:58:10,830
And I got the only key.

322
00:58:14,668 --> 00:58:18,196
- Would that test have worked, Doc?
- I think so, yes.

323
00:58:18,296 --> 00:58:20,198
Somebody else sure as hell thought so.

324
00:58:20,298 --> 00:58:23,301
Well, who else could've used that key?

325
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:27,180
Nobody! I just give it to Copper
whenever he needs it.

326
00:58:27,639 --> 00:58:30,000
Could anybody have gotten it from you, Doc?

327
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:34,104
I don't see how. As soon as I'm finished,
I return it right away.

328
00:58:35,647 --> 00:58:36,815
Great.

329
00:58:38,358 --> 00:58:42,195
- When was the last time you used it?
- Day or so ago.

330
00:58:43,947 --> 00:58:46,558
I suppose somebody could have
lifted it off me...

331
00:58:46,658 --> 00:58:47,809
Oh, come on!

332
00:58:47,909 --> 00:58:50,928
That key ring of yours
is always hooked to your belt.

333
00:58:51,363 --> 00:58:53,348
Accusing everybody...

334
00:58:54,332 --> 00:58:55,817
MacREADY: Stop it! It ain't worth it!

335
00:58:55,917 --> 00:58:57,869
Copper's the only one
who's got any business with it.

336
00:58:57,969 --> 00:59:00,238
Wait a minute!
You've been in here on several occasions.

337
00:59:00,338 --> 00:59:01,740
Doc thought of the test.

338
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:04,217
So what? Is that supposed to clear him?

339
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:08,112
- Windows!
- Windows!

340
00:59:20,650 --> 00:59:22,152
Put that down!

341
00:59:22,861 --> 00:59:25,697
- No.
- I'll put this right through your head.

342
00:59:27,407 --> 00:59:29,226
You guys gonna listen to Garry?

343
00:59:29,326 --> 00:59:32,521
You gonna let him give the orders?
He could be one of those things.

344
00:59:32,621 --> 00:59:33,872
Windows.

345
00:59:35,123 --> 00:59:38,001
Wait a minute. Just take it easy.
Put the gun down.

346
00:59:38,376 --> 00:59:40,737
Put it down. You don't want to hurt anybody.

347
00:59:40,837 --> 00:59:41,838
Right.

348
00:59:42,130 --> 00:59:43,590
On the floor.

349
00:59:58,355 --> 01:00:00,023
It's on the floor.

350
01:00:06,780 --> 01:00:08,823
I don't know about Copper,

351
01:00:10,033 --> 01:00:13,411
but I give you my word,
I did not go near that blood.

352
01:00:21,002 --> 01:00:24,005
But I guess you'll all feel a little easier

353
01:00:26,049 --> 01:00:28,343
if somebody else was in charge.

354
01:00:29,761 --> 01:00:32,722
Norris, I can't see anybody objecting to you.

355
01:00:36,059 --> 01:00:38,770
I'm sorry, fellas, but I'm not up to it.

356
01:00:39,354 --> 01:00:41,773
- I'll take it.
- Like hell you will.

357
01:00:42,774 --> 01:00:46,403
It should be somebody
a little more even-tempered, Childs.

358
01:00:56,454 --> 01:00:57,789
MacREADY: All right.

359
01:01:20,979 --> 01:01:22,605
MacREADY: I know I'm human.

360
01:01:26,192 --> 01:01:29,679
And if you were all these things,
then you'd just attack me right now.

361
01:01:29,779 --> 01:01:32,073
So some of you are still human.

362
01:01:33,032 --> 01:01:37,704
This thing doesn't want to show itself.
It wants to hide inside an imitation.

363
01:01:39,038 --> 01:01:41,024
It'll fight if it has to.

364
01:01:41,124 --> 01:01:43,668
But it's vulnerable out in the open.

365
01:01:44,878 --> 01:01:46,671
If it takes us over,

366
01:01:48,339 --> 01:01:50,467
then it has no more enemies,

367
01:01:51,509 --> 01:01:53,386
nobody left to kill it.

368
01:01:54,512 --> 01:01:56,181
And then it's won.

369
01:01:59,768 --> 01:02:02,520
There's a storm hitting us in six hours.

370
01:02:02,896 --> 01:02:05,190
We're gonna find out who's who.

371
01:02:05,857 --> 01:02:10,111
All right, Doc, Garry and Clark,
move over there away from the others.

372
01:02:21,873 --> 01:02:24,442
Norris, you and Childs
shoot them up with morphine.

373
01:02:24,542 --> 01:02:26,236
Tie them down in the rec room and watch them.

374
01:02:26,336 --> 01:02:27,904
Fuchs, you start working on a new technique.

375
01:02:28,004 --> 01:02:30,548
- I need Doc's help.
- You don't wanna drug me.

376
01:02:31,049 --> 01:02:33,009
Mac, I'm not a prisoner!

377
01:02:54,739 --> 01:02:56,975
Let me do it.
You're gonna break the needle in my arm.

378
01:02:57,075 --> 01:02:59,619
No, Doc, he's doing a real fine job.

379
01:03:08,962 --> 01:03:11,798
I'm gonna hide this tape when I'm finished.

380
01:03:12,090 --> 01:03:16,052
If none of us make it,
at least there'll be some kind of record.

381
01:03:16,427 --> 01:03:19,430
Storm's been hitting us hard now
for 48 hours.

382
01:03:20,682 --> 01:03:22,684
We still have nothing to go on.

383
01:03:34,904 --> 01:03:38,725
One other thing,
I think it rips through your clothes

384
01:03:38,825 --> 01:03:40,743
when it takes you over.

385
01:03:41,494 --> 01:03:45,748
Windows found some shredded long johns,
but the name tag was missing.

386
01:03:46,791 --> 01:03:48,751
They could be anybody's.

387
01:03:50,169 --> 01:03:51,421
Nobody...

388
01:03:54,132 --> 01:03:56,175
Nobody trusts anybody now.

389
01:03:58,052 --> 01:04:00,054
And we're all very tired.

390
01:04:07,312 --> 01:04:09,355
Nobody trusts anybody now.

391
01:04:13,651 --> 01:04:15,904
There's nothing else I can do.

392
01:04:16,571 --> 01:04:17,906
Just wait.

393
01:04:21,659 --> 01:04:24,954
R.J. MacReady, helicopter pilot,
U.S. Outpost, number 31.

394
01:04:40,053 --> 01:04:42,305
You come up with anything yet?

395
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:44,349
One or two ideas.

396
01:04:48,353 --> 01:04:50,547
But, MacReady, I've been thinking.

397
01:04:50,647 --> 01:04:54,592
If a small particle of this thing
is enough to take over an entire organism,

398
01:04:54,692 --> 01:04:56,761
then everyone should prepare their own meals.

399
01:04:56,861 --> 01:04:59,447
And I suggest we only eat out of cans.

400
01:05:00,698 --> 01:05:02,200
All right.

401
01:05:35,942 --> 01:05:37,318
Who's that?

402
01:06:14,772 --> 01:06:16,441
Anybody see Fuchs?

403
01:06:19,402 --> 01:06:21,429
Somebody blew out a fuse in the lab.

404
01:06:21,529 --> 01:06:24,933
Lights were out for an hour.
Anyone of us could've gotten to him.

405
01:06:25,033 --> 01:06:26,893
All right, we gotta find him.

406
01:06:26,993 --> 01:06:30,063
Nauls, why don't you come with me
and we'll look outside.

407
01:06:30,163 --> 01:06:32,690
Palmer, you and Windows check the inside.

408
01:06:32,790 --> 01:06:34,917
I ain't going with Windows.

409
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:38,947
I ain't going with him. I'll go with Childs.

410
01:06:39,047 --> 01:06:41,532
- Hey, fuck you, Palmer!
- I ain't going with you!

411
01:06:41,632 --> 01:06:44,969
- Who says I want you going with me?
- Cut the bullshit!

412
01:06:47,805 --> 01:06:50,500
Windows, you come with us.
Norris, you stay here.

413
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:53,878
Any of them move, you fry them.
You hear anything, cut loose on the sirens.

414
01:06:53,978 --> 01:06:57,065
We all meet back here
in 20 minutes regardless.

415
01:06:57,899 --> 01:07:01,652
And everybody watch whoever
you're with... real close.

416
01:07:24,425 --> 01:07:25,802
Hey, Blair.

417
01:07:28,179 --> 01:07:30,306
Blair, have you seen Fuchs?

418
01:07:33,851 --> 01:07:37,688
I don't wanna stay out here anymore.
I wanna come back inside.

419
01:07:41,234 --> 01:07:43,444
I hear funny things out here.

420
01:07:43,778 --> 01:07:46,614
- Have you come across Fuchs?
- It ain't Fuchs.

421
01:07:50,076 --> 01:07:51,619
It ain't Fuchs.

422
01:07:53,246 --> 01:07:56,107
I'm not gonna harm anybody.
There's nothing wrong with me.

423
01:07:56,207 --> 01:07:59,444
And if there was, I'm all better now.
I'd like to come back inside.

424
01:07:59,544 --> 01:08:01,546
Now you've got my promise.

425
01:08:04,549 --> 01:08:05,883
We'll see.

426
01:08:07,135 --> 01:08:09,720
Wait a minute, man.

427
01:08:10,721 --> 01:08:13,808
I wanna come back inside,
don't you understand?

428
01:08:14,267 --> 01:08:18,629
I'm all right.
I'm much better... and I won't harm anybody.

429
01:08:18,729 --> 01:08:21,399
You gotta let me come back inside.

430
01:08:27,989 --> 01:08:29,240
Hold it!

431
01:08:44,589 --> 01:08:46,007
Is it Fuchs?

432
01:08:53,514 --> 01:08:54,599
Yeah.

433
01:08:55,892 --> 01:08:57,768
Why would it burn him?

434
01:08:58,436 --> 01:09:01,147
Flare. Maybe he tried to burn it.

435
01:09:05,276 --> 01:09:08,654
Maybe he burned himself
before it could get to him.

436
01:09:15,286 --> 01:09:18,497
Great! Now what are we gonna do?

437
01:09:20,082 --> 01:09:22,777
You go inside.
Tell the others we found Fuchs.

438
01:09:22,877 --> 01:09:25,029
We'll be in as soon as we can.

439
01:09:25,129 --> 01:09:27,490
- Where are we going?
- Up to my shack.

440
01:09:27,590 --> 01:09:28,866
What the hell for?

441
01:09:28,966 --> 01:09:32,428
'Cause when I left yesterday,
I turned the lights off.

442
01:09:55,660 --> 01:09:57,520
How long have they been out there?

443
01:09:57,620 --> 01:09:59,455
Forty, 45 minutes.

444
01:10:00,331 --> 01:10:03,334
We better start closing off
the outside doors.

445
01:10:35,408 --> 01:10:37,994
Hey! All of you, come here!

446
01:10:53,884 --> 01:10:57,763
Open up! Open up this door! Open up! Open up!

447
01:11:00,433 --> 01:11:02,059
Close that door.

448
01:11:04,729 --> 01:11:06,355
Where's MacReady?

449
01:11:07,064 --> 01:11:09,300
I cut him loose of the line up by his shack.

450
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:11,093
- Cut him loose?
- Yeah.

451
01:11:11,193 --> 01:11:14,572
We were up checking around his place,
I found this.

452
01:11:16,240 --> 01:11:20,244
Look. It was stashed in his oil furnace.

453
01:11:20,494 --> 01:11:23,940
Wind must've dislodged it,
but I don't think he saw me find it.

454
01:11:24,040 --> 01:11:27,818
I made sure I got ahead of him
on the towline on the way back.

455
01:11:27,918 --> 01:11:29,462
I cut him loose.

456
01:11:29,587 --> 01:11:31,989
- MacReady?
- He's one of them.

457
01:11:32,089 --> 01:11:34,367
- When do you think it got to him?
- I don't know.

458
01:11:34,467 --> 01:11:36,911
It could've been anytime, anywhere.

459
01:11:37,011 --> 01:11:38,804
If it did get to him.

460
01:11:39,221 --> 01:11:40,790
Look, Childs, come on.

461
01:11:40,890 --> 01:11:42,792
- When the lights went out.
- That would've been perfect.

462
01:11:42,892 --> 01:11:46,003
Right. You said guys were missing.
Windows, where were you?

463
01:11:46,103 --> 01:11:47,964
I told you to shut your mouth!

464
01:11:49,273 --> 01:11:52,693
This is just what it wants!
To pit us against each other.

465
01:11:59,450 --> 01:12:01,310
- Let's open it.
- Hell no!

466
01:12:01,410 --> 01:12:03,062
You think he's changed
into one of those things?

467
01:12:03,162 --> 01:12:04,188
He's had time.

468
01:12:04,288 --> 01:12:07,191
Nothing human could've made it back
here in this weather without a guide line.

469
01:12:07,291 --> 01:12:09,402
- Let's open it now.
- Why are you so anxious to let him in here?

470
01:12:09,502 --> 01:12:10,528
Because it's so close.

471
01:12:10,628 --> 01:12:13,948
- May be our best chance to blow it away.
- Let him freeze.

472
01:12:14,048 --> 01:12:16,951
Childs, what if we're wrong about him?

473
01:12:17,051 --> 01:12:19,336
Well, then, we're wrong!

474
01:12:20,137 --> 01:12:22,164
The supply window!

475
01:12:22,264 --> 01:12:26,143
All right, all right, we got no choice now!

476
01:12:29,021 --> 01:12:31,424
Damn it! He's got the keys!

477
01:12:31,524 --> 01:12:33,759
What's going on? The towline snapped.

478
01:12:33,859 --> 01:12:37,321
Bullshit, Childs.
He's got to know damn well I cut it!

479
01:12:40,074 --> 01:12:41,909
You're a dead man, MacReady!

480
01:12:43,953 --> 01:12:46,163
Or a dead whatever the hell you are!

481
01:12:55,965 --> 01:12:58,968
Anyone messes with me
and the whole camp goes.

482
01:13:00,136 --> 01:13:02,138
Come on, Childs, burn me.

483
01:13:03,681 --> 01:13:06,600
Put those torches on the floor and back off.

484
01:13:14,650 --> 01:13:17,445
Back off. Way off.

485
01:13:27,246 --> 01:13:29,940
- You asshole.
- You'd have done the same thing.

486
01:13:30,040 --> 01:13:31,834
Don't argue with him.

487
01:13:33,377 --> 01:13:34,712
Where's the rest?

488
01:13:39,633 --> 01:13:41,118
Come on, man, I mean it!

489
01:13:41,218 --> 01:13:43,245
It's cool, MacReady, come on.

490
01:13:43,345 --> 01:13:45,473
Yeah. Yeah, man, just relax.

491
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:49,435
Anybody touches me... and we go.

492
01:14:02,448 --> 01:14:05,534
- He's not breathing!
- Go untie the doc.

493
01:14:07,828 --> 01:14:10,456
Get him in here. And bring the others.

494
01:14:14,001 --> 01:14:16,420
From now on, nobody gets out of my sight.

495
01:14:26,013 --> 01:14:27,264
Let me at him.

496
01:14:33,312 --> 01:14:37,024
So, you sweethearts were about to have
a little lynching party, huh?

497
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:42,263
I might just have to put an end to you
on general principles, Nauls.

498
01:14:42,363 --> 01:14:45,349
Did it ever occur to the jury that anybody
could've gotten some of my clothes

499
01:14:45,449 --> 01:14:48,352
- and stuck them up the furnace?
- We ain't buying that.

500
01:14:48,452 --> 01:14:52,540
Quit that bickering over there!
Windows, wheel that defibrillator over here.

501
01:14:53,332 --> 01:14:54,917
Give me those paddles!

502
01:14:55,459 --> 01:14:57,862
You're gonna have to sleep
sometime, MacReady.

503
01:14:57,962 --> 01:15:00,631
I'm a real light sleeper, Childs.

504
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:05,302
If anyone tries to wake me...

505
01:15:09,306 --> 01:15:10,474
Clear!

506
01:15:18,315 --> 01:15:19,984
- Clear!
- Clear.

507
01:16:18,709 --> 01:16:22,546
- We're on fire, MacReady! We're on fire!
- Get back! Just wait!

508
01:16:30,763 --> 01:16:32,264
All right, go!

509
01:16:53,369 --> 01:16:55,579
Windows! Windows, get in here!

510
01:17:21,605 --> 01:17:24,274
You gotta be fucking kidding.

511
01:17:44,086 --> 01:17:46,572
- What do you got in mind, MacReady?
- A little test.

512
01:17:46,672 --> 01:17:50,826
And, Windows, you and Palmer,
tie everybody down real tight.

513
01:17:50,926 --> 01:17:52,536
- What for?
- For your health.

514
01:17:52,636 --> 01:17:55,305
Let's rush him!
He's not gonna blow us all up!

515
01:17:59,143 --> 01:18:01,770
No, no, wait a minute. Wait a minute.

516
01:18:02,187 --> 01:18:04,523
Let's do what Mac says.

517
01:18:05,816 --> 01:18:09,053
I mean,
he wasted Norris pretty quick, didn't he?

518
01:18:09,153 --> 01:18:10,721
That's close enough, Clark.

519
01:18:10,821 --> 01:18:12,322
He ain't tying me up.

520
01:18:12,948 --> 01:18:15,159
Then I'll have to kill you, Childs.

521
01:18:15,617 --> 01:18:17,077
Then kill me.

522
01:18:26,378 --> 01:18:27,713
I mean it.

523
01:18:34,928 --> 01:18:36,472
I guess you do.

524
01:18:48,734 --> 01:18:50,594
Geez. This is bullshit, Mac!

525
01:18:50,694 --> 01:18:53,322
- Finish it, Palmer.
- They're dead, Mac!

526
01:18:58,744 --> 01:19:00,287
- Windows?
- Yo?

527
01:19:02,039 --> 01:19:04,166
You tie up Palmer over here.

528
01:19:08,462 --> 01:19:11,590
We're gonna draw a little bit
of everybody's blood

529
01:19:14,176 --> 01:19:16,762
'cause we're gonna find out who's the thing.

530
01:19:18,096 --> 01:19:21,266
Watching Norris in there
gave me the idea that

531
01:19:22,267 --> 01:19:24,812
maybe every part of him was a whole.

532
01:19:26,396 --> 01:19:29,399
Every little piece was an individual animal

533
01:19:29,942 --> 01:19:33,028
with a built-in desire
to protect its own life.

534
01:19:35,447 --> 01:19:37,574
You see, when a man bleeds,

535
01:19:39,743 --> 01:19:41,370
it's just tissue.

536
01:19:43,455 --> 01:19:47,376
The blood from one of you things
won't obey when it's attacked.

537
01:19:47,876 --> 01:19:49,753
It'll try and survive.

538
01:19:51,630 --> 01:19:54,258
Crawl away from a hot needle the same.

539
01:20:16,280 --> 01:20:17,489
Now you.

540
01:20:41,305 --> 01:20:42,723
That's good.

541
01:20:43,348 --> 01:20:45,767
All right, move back, over there.

542
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:35,108
I guess you're okay.

543
01:21:37,361 --> 01:21:40,322
All right. Put that on and watch them.

544
01:21:50,165 --> 01:21:52,793
Now I'll show you what I already know.

545
01:21:57,798 --> 01:21:59,591
It's a crock of shit.

546
01:22:00,425 --> 01:22:02,552
Let's try the doc and Clark.

547
01:22:20,654 --> 01:22:21,989
Now Clark.

548
01:22:31,415 --> 01:22:33,458
Then Clark was human, huh?

549
01:22:34,543 --> 01:22:37,129
Which makes you a murderer, don't it?

550
01:22:37,421 --> 01:22:38,797
Palmer now.

551
01:22:45,512 --> 01:22:48,598
This is pure nonsense.
It doesn't prove a thing.

552
01:22:49,057 --> 01:22:51,168
I thought you'd feel that way, Garry.

553
01:22:51,268 --> 01:22:53,670
You were the only one that could've
got to that blood.

554
01:22:53,770 --> 01:22:55,839
We'll do you last.

555
01:22:58,775 --> 01:23:02,820
Get him away from me! MacReady, burn it!

556
01:23:04,448 --> 01:23:05,824
What is it?

557
01:23:15,042 --> 01:23:16,293
Come on!

558
01:23:22,966 --> 01:23:24,843
Get me out of here!

559
01:23:30,974 --> 01:23:32,642
Windows, blast him!

560
01:23:35,562 --> 01:23:38,398
Get me out of here! Get me out of here!

561
01:24:07,219 --> 01:24:08,470
Windows!

562
01:24:29,825 --> 01:24:31,535
Get me out of here!

563
01:24:52,430 --> 01:24:55,625
MacReady, get in here! Come on, hurry up!

564
01:24:55,725 --> 01:24:59,129
He's coming back! Burn it!
Burn it, for God's sake!

565
01:24:59,229 --> 01:25:01,690
Hurry up, MacReady! Burn it!

566
01:25:35,432 --> 01:25:36,850
Let's do it.

567
01:25:50,447 --> 01:25:53,450
Get me out of here! Cut me loose!

568
01:25:53,909 --> 01:25:57,813
Cut me the hell... Come on, get me
out of here! Come on, get me out of here!

569
01:25:57,913 --> 01:25:59,789
Cut me loose, damn it!

570
01:26:17,807 --> 01:26:20,769
I know you gentlemen have been through a lot,

571
01:26:21,811 --> 01:26:23,939
but when you find the time,

572
01:26:24,814 --> 01:26:29,486
I'd rather not spend the rest
of this winter tied to this fucking couch!

573
01:26:51,883 --> 01:26:53,093
Childs.

574
01:26:53,551 --> 01:26:56,580
We're going out to give Blair the test.
If he tries to make it back here

575
01:26:56,680 --> 01:26:59,182
and we're not with him... burn him.

576
01:27:19,577 --> 01:27:21,621
Mac, the door's open!

577
01:27:36,386 --> 01:27:39,889
How'd he get out?
The door was bolted from the outside.

578
01:28:24,768 --> 01:28:25,935
Blair?

579
01:28:29,481 --> 01:28:33,818
Hey, Blair, you down there?
We got something for ya!

580
01:28:44,871 --> 01:28:47,665
Blair's been busy out here all by himself.

581
01:28:57,717 --> 01:28:58,968
What is it?

582
01:28:59,636 --> 01:29:01,246
Something he's been making.

583
01:29:01,346 --> 01:29:03,348
It's a ship of some kind.

584
01:29:04,933 --> 01:29:06,793
He stole the parts from the helicopter.

585
01:29:06,893 --> 01:29:09,813
The smart S.O.B. put it together
piece by piece.

586
01:29:11,564 --> 01:29:13,608
Where was he trying to go?

587
01:29:14,776 --> 01:29:16,444
Anyplace but here.

588
01:29:56,359 --> 01:29:58,695
Hey, you guys, come here. Come here.

589
01:30:05,410 --> 01:30:09,247
I think I saw Childs outside
the main entrance of the camp.

590
01:30:09,372 --> 01:30:12,041
- What's he doing outside?
- I don't know.

591
01:30:23,219 --> 01:30:24,596
Got a flare?

592
01:30:27,432 --> 01:30:30,226
He got back inside and blew the generator.

593
01:30:32,395 --> 01:30:35,256
In six hours,
it'll be a hundred below in here.

594
01:30:35,356 --> 01:30:37,150
Well, that's suicide!

595
01:30:38,067 --> 01:30:41,779
Not for that thing. It wants to freeze now.

596
01:30:42,989 --> 01:30:44,057
It's got no way out of here.

597
01:30:44,157 --> 01:30:47,619
It just wants to go to sleep in the cold
until the rescue team finds it.

598
01:30:49,329 --> 01:30:51,748
What can we do? What can we do?

599
01:30:53,374 --> 01:30:56,920
Whether we make it or not,
we can't let that thing freeze again.

600
01:30:58,254 --> 01:31:01,591
Maybe we'll just warm things up
a little around here.

601
01:31:06,638 --> 01:31:09,140
We're not getting out of here alive.

602
01:31:11,184 --> 01:31:12,936
But neither is that thing.

603
01:33:02,545 --> 01:33:04,213
Generator room.

604
01:34:11,989 --> 01:34:13,850
The generator's gone.

605
01:34:13,950 --> 01:34:15,785
Any way we can fix it?

606
01:34:18,079 --> 01:34:20,123
It's gone, MacReady.

607
01:34:28,548 --> 01:34:29,882
All right.

608
01:34:30,675 --> 01:34:34,220
We gotta bring this whole place
right down into the ice.

609
01:34:34,554 --> 01:34:37,390
Garry, plant yours in the old storage room.

610
01:34:37,974 --> 01:34:40,184
Nauls, down by the generator.

611
01:35:32,069 --> 01:35:33,321
God!

612
01:36:43,182 --> 01:36:45,184
How's it coming in there?

613
01:36:46,853 --> 01:36:48,921
I said, how's it...

614
01:38:33,918 --> 01:38:35,920
Yeah, fuck you, too!

615
01:40:01,297 --> 01:40:03,382
You the only one who made it?

616
01:40:04,216 --> 01:40:05,843
Not the only one.

617
01:40:08,387 --> 01:40:09,972
Did you kill it?

618
01:40:11,140 --> 01:40:13,017
Where were you, Childs?

619
01:40:14,518 --> 01:40:16,312
Thought I saw Blair.

620
01:40:17,646 --> 01:40:21,776
I went out after him
and got lost in the storm.

621
01:40:32,244 --> 01:40:35,331
Fire's got the temperature up
all over the camp.

622
01:40:37,583 --> 01:40:39,585
Won't last long, though.

623
01:40:40,377 --> 01:40:42,004
Neither will we.

624
01:40:44,173 --> 01:40:45,925
How will we make it?

625
01:40:48,135 --> 01:40:49,845
Maybe we shouldn't.

626
01:40:55,017 --> 01:40:56,585
If you're worried about me...

627
01:40:56,685 --> 01:40:59,522
If we've got any surprises for each other,

628
01:41:01,273 --> 01:41:04,902
I don't think we're in much shape
to do anything about it.

629
01:41:08,739 --> 01:41:12,827
Well... what do we do?

630
01:41:14,036 --> 01:41:15,830
Why don't we just...

631
01:41:17,540 --> 01:41:19,708
wait here for a little while?

632
01:41:22,378 --> 01:41:24,204
See what happens.
