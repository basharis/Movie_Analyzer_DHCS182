1
00:02:34,667 --> 00:02:37,209
Good morning. Had your breakfast?

2
00:02:37,334 --> 00:02:39,667
Good morning. Yes, thanks.

3
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:42,376
I gathered some mushrooms.

4
00:02:42,501 --> 00:02:44,626
Would you like some fried?

5
00:02:44,751 --> 00:02:46,751
No, thanks. Really. I'm full.

6
00:02:46,876 --> 00:02:48,417
Thanks.

7
00:02:48,542 --> 00:02:50,126
Fine. Have a nice day.

8
00:02:50,251 --> 00:02:52,167
By the way...

9
00:02:52,709 --> 00:02:54,376
do you keep horses at this hotel?

10
00:02:54,501 --> 00:02:56,167
No, no horses.

11
00:02:56,292 --> 00:02:57,459
You don't?

12
00:02:59,001 --> 00:03:01,209
I saw horses on your website.

13
00:03:01,334 --> 00:03:05,292
True, there are lots of wild horses
around here.

14
00:03:06,084 --> 00:03:07,126
I mean...

15
00:03:07,251 --> 00:03:09,209
it's just to decorate the website.

16
00:03:09,334 --> 00:03:10,334
I see.

17
00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:16,209
Good morning, Mr Aydin.

18
00:03:16,334 --> 00:03:18,417
- Where on earth were you?
- I'm here.

19
00:03:18,542 --> 00:03:22,417
The client wants his breakfast,
and there's nobody here.

20
00:03:22,542 --> 00:03:23,876
Where's Hidayet?

21
00:03:24,001 --> 00:03:25,501
Here somewhere.

22
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:30,584
Shall I make your coffee, Mr Aydin?

23
00:03:31,292 --> 00:03:32,917
Shall I make your coffee?

24
00:03:33,042 --> 00:03:34,626
I gathered mushrooms.

25
00:03:34,751 --> 00:03:36,584
Oh, where did you find them?

26
00:03:43,042 --> 00:03:44,209
Is Nihal up yet?

27
00:03:44,334 --> 00:03:47,334
Mrs Nihal got up early
and had breakfast already.

28
00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:52,417
Is she in her room?

29
00:03:52,542 --> 00:03:54,876
I don't know. I suppose so.

30
00:04:02,376 --> 00:04:03,917
Is Necla up?

31
00:04:04,042 --> 00:04:06,167
Mrs Necla hasn't come down yet.

32
00:04:08,251 --> 00:04:09,501
I see.

33
00:04:16,542 --> 00:04:19,084
Bring the coffee to my study.

34
00:05:37,834 --> 00:05:41,959
WINTER SLEEP

35
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:10,126
- Will the dogs attack us?
- No, don't worry.

36
00:06:15,126 --> 00:06:16,584
Ekrem!

37
00:06:29,751 --> 00:06:31,334
Ekrem!

38
00:06:39,417 --> 00:06:41,001
<i>The horse I'll catch for you</i>

39
00:06:41,126 --> 00:06:43,251
is the toughest breed in Turkey.

40
00:06:43,376 --> 00:06:45,126
Come on, we saw them for 600.

41
00:06:45,251 --> 00:06:47,584
But how old are they?

42
00:06:47,709 --> 00:06:50,584
Are their legs OK? Their tendons?

43
00:06:50,709 --> 00:06:52,917
Any lung or heart problems?

44
00:06:53,042 --> 00:06:54,626
You don't know anything.

45
00:06:54,751 --> 00:06:58,542
You'll go and buy one, then be sorry.

46
00:06:58,667 --> 00:07:02,209
You'll pay 500, then sell it for 300.

47
00:07:02,334 --> 00:07:05,126
I'll catch you a young, sturdy one.

48
00:07:05,251 --> 00:07:07,959
He'll be your friend for life.

49
00:07:08,084 --> 00:07:09,459
Isn't that perfect?

50
00:07:09,584 --> 00:07:11,376
- The colour?
- You can choose.

51
00:07:11,501 --> 00:07:13,001
There's a choice.

52
00:07:13,126 --> 00:07:17,376
Just let me check its hooves
to make sure it's sturdy.

53
00:07:17,501 --> 00:07:19,667
Two years ago, I caught a horse.

54
00:07:19,792 --> 00:07:23,709
I entered it in the
Jockey Club endurance race.

55
00:07:23,834 --> 00:07:26,251
It won the 80km event.

56
00:07:26,376 --> 00:07:28,792
The guys said it was
as small as a donkey.

57
00:07:28,917 --> 00:07:31,876
"But donkeys lead camels",
I told them.

58
00:07:32,001 --> 00:07:33,917
That's our Anatolian horses.

59
00:07:34,042 --> 00:07:36,959
I finished 45 minutes before the rest.

60
00:07:37,084 --> 00:07:39,084
- 45 minutes!
- 27 horses started.

61
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:44,126
These are our ancestors' horses,
fine, hardy beasts.

62
00:07:44,251 --> 00:07:46,292
So when can we do it?

63
00:07:46,417 --> 00:07:49,917
When I have time
and the weather's fine.

64
00:07:50,042 --> 00:07:51,626
This coming week?

65
00:07:51,751 --> 00:07:52,917
If the mud dries.

66
00:07:53,042 --> 00:07:54,959
I'll let you know.

67
00:08:49,792 --> 00:08:52,667
Did the other one pay
after the warning?

68
00:08:52,792 --> 00:08:55,042
No. Nothing.

69
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:58,709
The lawyer says we could evict him
in two months.

70
00:08:58,834 --> 00:09:01,167
How?

71
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:04,167
The law protects the tenants.

72
00:09:05,751 --> 00:09:08,417
They don't know all that.

73
00:09:08,542 --> 00:09:11,376
I don't think
they will even hire a lawyer.

74
00:09:13,876 --> 00:09:17,459
Sometimes, I'm tempted to sell them all,

75
00:09:17,584 --> 00:09:19,834
although they come from my father.

76
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:24,709
They think you're a bit soft.
That's why they behave like this.

77
00:09:26,126 --> 00:09:29,626
Otherwise, there's no such thing
around here.

78
00:09:29,751 --> 00:09:32,042
How dare they not pay rent?

79
00:09:32,167 --> 00:09:36,917
Come on, Hidayet.
What else can I do?

80
00:09:37,751 --> 00:09:40,126
What's so soft about me?

81
00:09:40,917 --> 00:09:44,001
We go to court.
What else can we do?

82
00:09:44,126 --> 00:09:45,167
Well, Mr Aydin,

83
00:09:45,292 --> 00:09:47,917
there are actually lots of things to do.

84
00:09:48,626 --> 00:09:49,626
Anyway...

85
00:10:00,209 --> 00:10:01,667
Fucking bastard!

86
00:10:04,584 --> 00:10:06,001
Come here, you!

87
00:10:33,667 --> 00:10:35,334
Get up, you!

88
00:10:36,251 --> 00:10:37,667
Keep still or I'll slap you.

89
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:42,042
- What happened?
- I caught him.

90
00:10:42,167 --> 00:10:44,959
I mean, why is he soaked?

91
00:10:45,084 --> 00:10:46,126
He fell in the water.

92
00:10:46,251 --> 00:10:49,251
He tried to jump the stream and slipped.

93
00:10:49,376 --> 00:10:53,501
- Any bruises?
- No. He just got wet.

94
00:10:54,792 --> 00:10:56,501
So why throw the stone?

95
00:10:56,626 --> 00:10:59,792
Soaked like that,
best get him home quick

96
00:10:59,917 --> 00:11:03,292
before he catches cold.
I'll explain later, Mr Aydin.

97
00:11:03,417 --> 00:11:04,459
All right.

98
00:11:17,501 --> 00:11:18,876
Come on.

99
00:11:28,292 --> 00:11:31,209
- I'll talk to them.
- All right.

100
00:11:55,584 --> 00:11:57,167
Hamdi hodja!

101
00:12:19,751 --> 00:12:21,417
You get inside.

102
00:12:22,334 --> 00:12:23,959
Hello.

103
00:12:25,084 --> 00:12:26,626
Hello.

104
00:12:27,501 --> 00:12:29,542
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

105
00:12:30,334 --> 00:12:33,417
Your kid fell in the water.
We brought him back quick.

106
00:12:38,334 --> 00:12:41,209
- Where, how?
- Near lssiz.

107
00:12:41,334 --> 00:12:44,209
He slipped jumping the stream
and got wet.

108
00:12:46,251 --> 00:12:48,084
What was he doing there?

109
00:12:49,042 --> 00:12:52,251
He was hiding, waiting for our car.

110
00:12:52,376 --> 00:12:55,042
He threw a stone and broke our window.

111
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:59,251
We'd have crashed
if I hadn't managed to turn and brake.

112
00:13:02,251 --> 00:13:04,292
- My son Ilyas?
- Yes.

113
00:13:05,042 --> 00:13:08,709
- He broke your window with a stone?
- Yes. Go see for yourself.

114
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:15,376
How can such a little kid
break a window like that?

115
00:13:15,501 --> 00:13:19,126
You know better than me, Ismail.
He's your son after all.

116
00:13:21,209 --> 00:13:23,167
Stop bullshitting.

117
00:13:23,834 --> 00:13:24,917
Say what you want.

118
00:13:25,042 --> 00:13:26,209
Nothing to say.

119
00:13:26,334 --> 00:13:29,167
The glass is there. You tell me.

120
00:13:34,584 --> 00:13:36,834
It's no simple matter.

121
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:40,084
We nearly crashed, Ismail.
What do you expect?

122
00:13:41,084 --> 00:13:42,626
Am I wrong?

123
00:13:43,584 --> 00:13:45,584
Anyway, we'll pay for it.

124
00:13:45,709 --> 00:13:49,251
Look, it's not just about the money.

125
00:13:49,376 --> 00:13:52,876
Call the kid and ask him
what got into him.

126
00:13:54,626 --> 00:13:56,959
We asked him already,
but he wouldn't say.

127
00:13:57,417 --> 00:14:02,042
We nearly died out there,
because of a shitty little stone.

128
00:14:02,167 --> 00:14:04,042
It's no joke, Ismail.

129
00:14:06,542 --> 00:14:08,084
Ilyas.

130
00:14:11,751 --> 00:14:13,376
Come here!

131
00:14:27,167 --> 00:14:29,084
Did you throw the stone, son?

132
00:14:38,584 --> 00:14:39,626
Did you?

133
00:14:43,876 --> 00:14:45,084
Ilyas!

134
00:14:45,709 --> 00:14:47,626
Did you throw that stone?

135
00:15:03,251 --> 00:15:04,417
Go now.

136
00:15:40,917 --> 00:15:44,376
There was no need for that.

137
00:15:44,501 --> 00:15:47,751
Don't go over the top.

138
00:15:47,876 --> 00:15:52,751
But it's not so simple.
That's why I'm telling you.

139
00:16:01,917 --> 00:16:02,917
Hidayet.

140
00:16:27,001 --> 00:16:28,542
How's that? Happy?

141
00:16:29,167 --> 00:16:32,001
Is that all right now?
Feel better?

142
00:16:35,501 --> 00:16:38,126
A slap for a broken window.

143
00:16:38,751 --> 00:16:40,251
Is that enough for you two?

144
00:16:40,376 --> 00:16:42,876
Or should I call him back for some more?

145
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:47,751
What's all this, Ismail?
What's happening?

146
00:16:49,501 --> 00:16:50,542
Hidayet?

147
00:16:50,667 --> 00:16:53,834
The kid fell in the water.
We brought him back.

148
00:16:53,959 --> 00:16:56,042
But we shouldn't have bothered.

149
00:16:58,584 --> 00:17:01,584
Our Ilyas broke their car window.

150
00:17:01,709 --> 00:17:03,792
- He broke their window?
- Yes.

151
00:17:03,917 --> 00:17:05,417
So they're here to make us pay.

152
00:17:05,542 --> 00:17:07,251
Did I say that?

153
00:17:07,376 --> 00:17:11,209
Didn't I say we brought him home
so he wouldn't get sick?

154
00:17:11,334 --> 00:17:13,084
Cut it out.

155
00:17:13,209 --> 00:17:18,792
You took our fridge and TV
for a lousy rent. Isn't that enough?

156
00:17:18,917 --> 00:17:20,917
Now you're hassling a kid?

157
00:17:21,042 --> 00:17:24,417
- Stop showing off, Ismail.
- What did you say?

158
00:17:24,542 --> 00:17:27,417
- Don't bullshit me, Ismail.
- What bullshit?

159
00:17:27,542 --> 00:17:29,251
Ismail, don't piss me off.

160
00:17:29,376 --> 00:17:30,876
What the fuck?

161
00:17:31,001 --> 00:17:34,084
- Whatever. Get lost.
- What the fuck did you say?

162
00:17:34,209 --> 00:17:35,459
Stop bullshitting.

163
00:17:35,584 --> 00:17:39,042
You come and hassle me at home.
Who the hell do you think you are?

164
00:17:39,167 --> 00:17:40,584
I've no time for all this...

165
00:17:40,709 --> 00:17:43,751
- Clear off, Hamdi. I'll fuck him up!
- Ismail!

166
00:17:43,876 --> 00:17:46,001
Come here!
Come here, I'm telling you.

167
00:17:46,126 --> 00:17:47,792
Don't make it any worse.

168
00:17:47,917 --> 00:17:50,292
Ismail, I'm talking to you.

169
00:17:50,417 --> 00:17:52,751
Let go.
I'll fuck him over right here.

170
00:17:53,292 --> 00:17:54,459
Stop it!

171
00:17:55,917 --> 00:17:57,792
I'll kill that fucker.

172
00:17:57,917 --> 00:18:00,334
I'll fuck you up, son of a bitch.

173
00:18:00,459 --> 00:18:02,459
Come on, throw it, you fucker.

174
00:18:02,584 --> 00:18:04,792
- Stop cursing, son of a bitch!
- Get lost!

175
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,626
Leave it, Ismail. Get in.

176
00:18:06,751 --> 00:18:07,751
Come here!

177
00:18:11,376 --> 00:18:12,876
Fuck off.

178
00:18:13,001 --> 00:18:14,501
Get him inside!

179
00:18:18,417 --> 00:18:20,751
- Look at that bastard.
- Come on.

180
00:18:20,876 --> 00:18:23,084
Letting a drunk provoke you.

181
00:18:23,209 --> 00:18:25,501
But he kept cursing.

182
00:18:37,459 --> 00:18:38,876
I'll go and see.

183
00:18:40,334 --> 00:18:42,001
Fuck.

184
00:18:56,542 --> 00:18:59,626
Hidayet, I'm really sorry.

185
00:18:59,751 --> 00:19:03,084
I'm as shocked as you.
I don't know what to say.

186
00:19:03,209 --> 00:19:05,376
What's going on, Hamdi?

187
00:19:05,501 --> 00:19:08,542
What's all this show about?
It's beyond me.

188
00:19:09,501 --> 00:19:12,126
He wouldn't dare act big
if you weren't here.

189
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:15,001
Well... the window's broken

190
00:19:15,126 --> 00:19:16,959
and we'll pay for it.

191
00:19:17,084 --> 00:19:19,667
We'll pay the rent
as soon we can, too.

192
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:24,292
We haven't forgotten. God willing,
I'll bring it all to you in person.

193
00:19:24,417 --> 00:19:26,251
But we're having a hard time.

194
00:19:26,376 --> 00:19:29,292
We're not here for that.
That's a different issue.

195
00:19:29,417 --> 00:19:31,251
We always pay our debts.

196
00:19:31,376 --> 00:19:36,501
Mr Aydin's late father knew us well.
With him, we never had any problems.

197
00:19:36,626 --> 00:19:39,042
We got on well for years.

198
00:19:39,167 --> 00:19:42,209
That's why you didn't have to do
what you did.

199
00:19:42,334 --> 00:19:46,084
Wouldn't it be better
if we weren't disgraced?

200
00:19:46,209 --> 00:19:49,292
Don't you agree?
We too have our pride.

201
00:19:49,417 --> 00:19:53,001
For God's sake, Hamdi,
drop that talk.

202
00:19:53,126 --> 00:19:58,042
We didn't say anything for months.
You'll start blaming us at this rate.

203
00:19:58,167 --> 00:20:00,084
OK, Hidayet, come on.

204
00:20:00,209 --> 00:20:03,709
But sending a debt collector so suddenly,
is that right?

205
00:20:03,834 --> 00:20:07,209
You could have talked to us first.
Talking exists, doesn't it?

206
00:20:07,334 --> 00:20:08,501
Come on, Hidayet.

207
00:20:08,626 --> 00:20:12,459
How many times did we talk?
How many times did I tell you?

208
00:20:12,584 --> 00:20:15,042
I did, didn't I?

209
00:20:15,167 --> 00:20:16,584
A thousand times, Mr Aydin.

210
00:20:16,709 --> 00:20:18,751
You'll talk about it later. Come on.

211
00:20:18,876 --> 00:20:21,709
And I told you we'd sort it out.
Didn't I?

212
00:20:21,834 --> 00:20:24,709
And did you sort it out?

213
00:20:24,834 --> 00:20:26,501
Is it sorted out, Hamdi?

214
00:20:27,376 --> 00:20:28,667
Forget it, it's OK.

215
00:20:28,792 --> 00:20:30,834
My apologies again, Mr Aydin.

216
00:20:30,959 --> 00:20:34,584
I myself will bring the money
for the window to your place.

217
00:20:34,709 --> 00:20:38,126
OK, you'll talk about it later.

218
00:20:38,251 --> 00:20:39,667
I'll settle it quickly.

219
00:20:39,792 --> 00:20:43,334
I'll come whenever it suits you.

220
00:20:43,459 --> 00:20:46,001
- All right.
- Please, don't worry.

221
00:20:46,126 --> 00:20:48,126
You waste your time with anybody.

222
00:20:48,251 --> 00:20:51,251
Jerk. Scum of the earth.

223
00:20:51,376 --> 00:20:54,459
- My apologies again.
- Who the hell are you?

224
00:20:54,584 --> 00:20:57,626
OK, bye.

225
00:20:58,792 --> 00:21:01,001
Have a good day.

226
00:21:09,751 --> 00:21:12,417
Bastard. Son of a bitch.

227
00:21:30,834 --> 00:21:32,417
Fatma.

228
00:21:32,542 --> 00:21:33,917
Come here.

229
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:35,376
What's that?

230
00:21:35,501 --> 00:21:37,459
Your dowry. What do you think?

231
00:21:37,584 --> 00:21:38,917
Put them down.

232
00:21:39,626 --> 00:21:40,626
Take these.

233
00:21:40,751 --> 00:21:42,209
Leave them.

234
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:46,167
- Where shall I take them?
- Out back, to the terrace.

235
00:21:46,292 --> 00:21:48,709
Careful, don't bump into anything.

236
00:21:48,834 --> 00:21:50,251
Easy. Come on.

237
00:21:52,292 --> 00:21:54,209
- Let me take it.
- I'm fine.

238
00:21:54,334 --> 00:21:57,084
I'm off to get the window fixed.

239
00:21:57,209 --> 00:21:59,501
- All right.
- Anything else?

240
00:22:02,001 --> 00:22:03,001
No.

241
00:22:03,126 --> 00:22:07,042
Should I get a brand-name
or generic product?

242
00:22:08,501 --> 00:22:10,042
Where'll you get a brand?

243
00:22:10,167 --> 00:22:13,876
Nowhere. That's why I'm asking.

244
00:22:18,834 --> 00:22:20,417
Go on, Hidayet.

245
00:22:37,001 --> 00:22:40,501
- Do we have guests?
- Levent the teacher is here.

246
00:22:40,626 --> 00:22:44,042
- So they had tea?
- Yes, but they want coffee now.

247
00:23:28,917 --> 00:23:30,626
What are you doing?

248
00:23:31,126 --> 00:23:32,209
Not much.

249
00:23:32,334 --> 00:23:35,042
Here's a hot drink for my brother.

250
00:23:35,167 --> 00:23:37,667
That's nice of you.

251
00:23:38,292 --> 00:23:40,417
Who'd care for me,
if you weren't around?

252
00:23:40,542 --> 00:23:44,459
- We're out of lime, so I made sage.
- Don't worry, it's fine.

253
00:23:45,126 --> 00:23:49,042
Don't stop. I'll just flick
through some magazines.

254
00:23:49,167 --> 00:23:50,792
Sure.

255
00:24:01,584 --> 00:24:03,626
Are you writing your column?

256
00:24:05,292 --> 00:24:07,376
I'm trying to.

257
00:24:11,459 --> 00:24:14,167
By the way, I read last week's.

258
00:24:20,251 --> 00:24:21,751
I liked it.

259
00:24:22,501 --> 00:24:24,167
Which one do you mean?

260
00:24:24,292 --> 00:24:28,042
Urban ugliness in Anatolia.
Aesthetic deprivation and so on.

261
00:24:28,167 --> 00:24:29,667
- Right.
- Bravo.

262
00:24:30,667 --> 00:24:35,334
How do you come up
with interesting ideas every week?

263
00:24:36,292 --> 00:24:38,042
Did you really like it?

264
00:24:39,167 --> 00:24:40,709
It was good.

265
00:24:40,834 --> 00:24:43,084
It's not about wealth and poverty.

266
00:24:43,209 --> 00:24:45,376
Poverty existed in the past, too.

267
00:24:45,501 --> 00:24:49,376
If you only have three olives,
you can place them nicely on a plate,

268
00:24:49,501 --> 00:24:52,667
or gobble them out of the plastic bag.

269
00:24:52,792 --> 00:24:54,917
I know what you mean.

270
00:24:55,042 --> 00:24:58,084
I told you we went to the hodja's?
You know, our tenant.

271
00:24:58,209 --> 00:24:59,292
Yes?

272
00:24:59,417 --> 00:25:02,626
If you saw how filthy it was,
how messy.

273
00:25:03,292 --> 00:25:06,084
- Did you go in?
- No, I mean the garden.

274
00:25:07,251 --> 00:25:08,334
They've ruined it.

275
00:25:09,292 --> 00:25:12,626
A woman lives there too,
but you wouldn't think so.

276
00:25:13,792 --> 00:25:16,501
First of all, you are a man of God.

277
00:25:16,626 --> 00:25:20,084
You should be a model to your community.

278
00:25:20,209 --> 00:25:22,084
Shouldn't you be neat and tidy?

279
00:25:22,209 --> 00:25:24,334
Who is he? Do I know him?

280
00:25:24,459 --> 00:25:26,084
No, you wouldn't.

281
00:25:26,584 --> 00:25:29,584
An old tenant
from back in my father's day.

282
00:25:30,459 --> 00:25:32,459
I'd walk past him in the street.

283
00:25:32,584 --> 00:25:35,251
Just a crooked, shabby guy.

284
00:25:36,001 --> 00:25:37,959
I don't know...

285
00:25:38,084 --> 00:25:41,626
Shouldn't men of God
be a model to the public?

286
00:25:41,751 --> 00:25:44,042
Especially in rural areas.

287
00:25:45,084 --> 00:25:48,126
Perhaps I should write about that next week?

288
00:25:48,251 --> 00:25:50,667
The very thought of him gets on my nerves.

289
00:25:52,834 --> 00:25:55,626
Of course, write about anything you want.

290
00:25:55,751 --> 00:25:57,334
But...

291
00:25:58,167 --> 00:26:02,126
Wouldn't it be better to write
for a bigger paper

292
00:26:02,251 --> 00:26:04,459
instead of a local one nobody reads?

293
00:26:05,334 --> 00:26:09,334
Then at least it would be worth
all your efforts.

294
00:26:10,709 --> 00:26:13,459
I don't feel I'm making any efforts.

295
00:26:13,584 --> 00:26:19,084
I mean, I hear you typing away
in front of your computer all week.

296
00:26:19,209 --> 00:26:21,251
That's why.

297
00:26:22,792 --> 00:26:26,042
If you didn't bring me that paper,

298
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:29,667
I wouldn't even know it existed.

299
00:26:29,792 --> 00:26:31,292
That's what I mean.

300
00:26:31,417 --> 00:26:34,584
Frankly, I don't give a damn
about big papers.

301
00:26:35,876 --> 00:26:39,376
My kingdom may be small
but at least I'm the king there.

302
00:26:39,501 --> 00:26:42,667
I mean, who's going to read this paper?

303
00:26:42,792 --> 00:26:45,334
Who's going to buy it?

304
00:26:45,459 --> 00:26:48,667
I don't agree with you,
my dear Necla.

305
00:26:48,792 --> 00:26:50,626
On the contrary.

306
00:26:51,667 --> 00:26:55,001
Sometimes I receive letters from my readers

307
00:26:55,126 --> 00:26:57,917
that prove to me
I'm on the right path.

308
00:26:58,876 --> 00:27:01,042
Even my efforts, as you say,

309
00:27:01,167 --> 00:27:03,667
feel more than worth it.

310
00:27:03,792 --> 00:27:06,709
- Take yesterday...
- Yes, but sometimes on the Internet,

311
00:27:06,834 --> 00:27:09,917
some awful writers get praised
to high heaven.

312
00:27:10,917 --> 00:27:13,584
Everyone has their fans somehow.

313
00:27:14,834 --> 00:27:19,542
That's why I think one
shouldn't take such praise so seriously.

314
00:27:19,667 --> 00:27:23,001
I mean, that shouldn't be your reference.

315
00:27:25,292 --> 00:27:28,626
Anyway, keep on writing.
Don't let me distract you.

316
00:27:29,417 --> 00:27:31,834
I'll just lie down here.

317
00:27:31,959 --> 00:27:33,667
In silence.

318
00:28:03,042 --> 00:28:05,167
The mud makes driving up here hard.

319
00:28:05,292 --> 00:28:07,501
Why don't you lay some gravel?

320
00:28:07,626 --> 00:28:10,501
The tourists like it this way,
it's more natural.

321
00:28:11,209 --> 00:28:15,542
I didn't say asphalt, I said gravel.
That's natural too.

322
00:28:15,667 --> 00:28:18,626
With gravel,
half the tourists wouldn't come.

323
00:28:18,751 --> 00:28:22,417
Very few clients in winter, in fact.
Wouldn't be worth it.

324
00:28:23,292 --> 00:28:25,626
Of course nobody comes with this mud.

325
00:28:26,167 --> 00:28:27,667
Don't want everyone here anyway.

326
00:28:27,792 --> 00:28:30,376
I just want those who value a natural setting.

327
00:28:30,501 --> 00:28:32,209
Fancy a sprint?

328
00:28:32,334 --> 00:28:33,542
- Fine.
- Good.

329
00:28:33,667 --> 00:28:34,751
- Ready?
- Yes.

330
00:28:34,876 --> 00:28:36,292
We're off!

331
00:28:37,751 --> 00:28:39,542
Did you put on weight?

332
00:28:39,667 --> 00:28:41,167
- What?
- You put on weight?

333
00:28:41,292 --> 00:28:42,834
What weight, man?

334
00:28:42,959 --> 00:28:45,417
My belly's declared independence.

335
00:28:45,542 --> 00:28:49,209
- Be careful. Don't let yourself go.
- What if I did?

336
00:28:50,209 --> 00:28:53,834
I've buried my wife.
I'm all alone.

337
00:28:54,417 --> 00:28:58,542
It's you who should be worried.
With a young, beautiful wife.

338
00:28:58,667 --> 00:29:03,084
If you don't look out,
they'll be asking if Nihal's your daughter.

339
00:29:03,209 --> 00:29:07,001
Come on. I'm not that bad.

340
00:29:07,126 --> 00:29:10,667
What about that mass suicide
around your hairline then?

341
00:29:11,584 --> 00:29:13,084
<i>It's no big deal, but...</i>

342
00:29:13,751 --> 00:29:16,876
You know that village, Garip,
near your farm...

343
00:29:17,001 --> 00:29:18,792
Yes, but I've never been.

344
00:29:18,917 --> 00:29:20,542
Whatever...

345
00:29:21,042 --> 00:29:24,584
A girl from the public education office
wrote to me.

346
00:29:24,709 --> 00:29:27,834
I don't usually care much
for that kind of thing.

347
00:29:27,959 --> 00:29:30,501
But for some reason, I was touched.

348
00:29:30,626 --> 00:29:33,126
Maybe I'm just getting old.

349
00:29:33,251 --> 00:29:37,709
I wanted to ask you
whether I should take it seriously.

350
00:29:37,834 --> 00:29:39,626
What's she after? A donation?

351
00:29:39,751 --> 00:29:43,626
Nothing much, the main thing is...

352
00:29:43,751 --> 00:29:44,959
Come in, Fatma.

353
00:29:45,084 --> 00:29:49,209
I couldn't make out if she's sincere
or after something else.

354
00:29:49,334 --> 00:29:51,542
Being a good judge of character,

355
00:29:51,667 --> 00:29:54,709
you'll easily see
what's what from the letter.

356
00:29:54,834 --> 00:29:56,001
I wanted to ask you.

357
00:29:56,126 --> 00:29:59,542
- Where shall I put your tea?
- On the table's fine.

358
00:30:00,209 --> 00:30:02,417
- Where is the letter?
- On the computer.

359
00:30:02,542 --> 00:30:04,542
- Read it out then.
- Right, listen.

360
00:30:04,667 --> 00:30:05,667
Thanks, Fatma.

361
00:30:13,959 --> 00:30:18,501
Nihal loves charity like this.
Should we call her as well?

362
00:30:18,626 --> 00:30:21,084
Go ahead. If you like.

363
00:30:21,876 --> 00:30:23,792
- We should, shouldn't we?
- Yes.

364
00:30:24,876 --> 00:30:26,501
I don't know if she's free.

365
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:37,417
Nihal?

366
00:30:37,542 --> 00:30:39,876
Suavi's here,
we're discussing something.

367
00:30:40,001 --> 00:30:43,292
I was wondering
if you're free to join us.

368
00:30:43,417 --> 00:30:45,626
We need your opinion.

369
00:30:46,584 --> 00:30:48,542
Yes, we're in my study.

370
00:30:48,667 --> 00:30:50,376
All right, dear.

371
00:30:51,334 --> 00:30:53,001
- She's coming.
- Good.

372
00:31:01,834 --> 00:31:04,001
Mr Suavi, how are you?

373
00:31:04,126 --> 00:31:06,376
Fine, thanks, and you?

374
00:31:06,501 --> 00:31:07,751
Fine, thank you.

375
00:31:07,876 --> 00:31:10,542
It's been a long time.
Are you doing OK?

376
00:31:10,667 --> 00:31:12,542
I'm fine. No problems.

377
00:31:12,667 --> 00:31:14,667
I don't leave the farm anyway.

378
00:31:14,792 --> 00:31:17,084
What problems could there be?

379
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:20,209
How are your activities doing?

380
00:31:20,667 --> 00:31:23,042
As usual. The same old routine.

381
00:31:23,167 --> 00:31:25,042
But tell me what's your secret

382
00:31:25,167 --> 00:31:28,417
for looking younger
and more beautiful every time?

383
00:31:28,917 --> 00:31:31,959
That's very kind of you.
Thanks very much.

384
00:31:32,084 --> 00:31:35,042
How is your daughter?
Does she come to visit?

385
00:31:35,167 --> 00:31:36,834
Well, you know...

386
00:31:36,959 --> 00:31:39,334
She came once when she graduated.

387
00:31:39,459 --> 00:31:41,501
And when we lost her mother.

388
00:31:41,626 --> 00:31:42,959
That was it really.

389
00:31:43,084 --> 00:31:45,167
- She's still in London?
- Yes.

390
00:31:45,292 --> 00:31:48,251
Why don't you join her?
Why stay here all alone?

391
00:31:48,376 --> 00:31:49,376
Me?

392
00:31:49,501 --> 00:31:51,417
Heaven forbid.

393
00:31:51,542 --> 00:31:55,667
I can't stand that English husband saying
"Oh, lovely" to everything.

394
00:31:55,792 --> 00:31:58,667
Just don't talk like that.

395
00:31:58,792 --> 00:32:02,501
So, let me tell Nihal.
I was saying to Suavi

396
00:32:02,626 --> 00:32:04,667
I got a letter the other day.

397
00:32:04,792 --> 00:32:09,126
A young girl who teaches needlecraft
in a local village.

398
00:32:09,251 --> 00:32:11,542
In short, she's asking for help.

399
00:32:12,334 --> 00:32:15,751
I'm not sure how to respond,
so I thought I'd ask you two.

400
00:32:16,417 --> 00:32:18,209
What kind of help does she want?

401
00:32:19,751 --> 00:32:22,209
Actually, the letter is here.
Shall I read it?

402
00:32:22,917 --> 00:32:24,126
Sure. Go ahead.

403
00:32:28,042 --> 00:32:29,834
All right then, I will.

404
00:32:36,084 --> 00:32:37,584
Let me see.

405
00:32:37,709 --> 00:32:39,126
Yes, here it is.

406
00:32:42,542 --> 00:32:44,042
"Dear Mr Aydin,

407
00:32:44,167 --> 00:32:46,417
"I would like you to know that...

408
00:32:46,542 --> 00:32:49,334
"I am a great admirer of you
and your articles.

409
00:32:49,459 --> 00:32:52,251
"I'm always eager
to read your weekly column

410
00:32:52,376 --> 00:32:54,584
"in our local paper 'Voice of the Steppe',

411
00:32:54,709 --> 00:32:59,334
"impatient to benefit from your
vast experience and courageous ideas.

412
00:33:00,001 --> 00:33:03,667
"We, the teachers
at the Technical School for Girls,

413
00:33:03,792 --> 00:33:07,334
"are proud that our town
has such a valued citizen."

414
00:33:08,626 --> 00:33:11,209
Blah, blah, we can skip all this.

415
00:33:12,167 --> 00:33:14,126
Yes... let's continue from there.

416
00:33:14,251 --> 00:33:16,501
"We, a group of teachers,

417
00:33:16,626 --> 00:33:19,959
"wanted to build a small building in Garip,

418
00:33:20,084 --> 00:33:24,709
"one of the area's poorest villages
to teach crafts and writing

419
00:33:24,834 --> 00:33:27,292
"to the women of the village.

420
00:33:28,042 --> 00:33:31,376
"The mukhtar helped
as much as he could.

421
00:33:31,501 --> 00:33:35,209
"However, despite all our efforts,
our resources ran out

422
00:33:35,334 --> 00:33:37,292
"with the work not finished.

423
00:33:37,417 --> 00:33:41,459
"We applied for support to the municipality,
but we were rejected.

424
00:33:41,584 --> 00:33:45,167
"We have been left helpless,
all alone in the middle of this steppe,

425
00:33:45,292 --> 00:33:47,834
"with all our good intentions and hopes.

426
00:33:48,376 --> 00:33:51,459
"While we sat disheartened
seeking a solution,

427
00:33:51,584 --> 00:33:55,792
"I suddenly remembered your article
'Flowers of the Steppes'.

428
00:33:55,917 --> 00:33:58,084
"It felt as if you were describing us.

429
00:33:58,209 --> 00:34:02,459
"Me and my friends
read that article again in tears.

430
00:34:03,167 --> 00:34:05,959
"Believe me, my intention
is not emotional blackmail.

431
00:34:06,084 --> 00:34:10,626
"I want you to know
that I would never feel ashamed

432
00:34:10,751 --> 00:34:15,126
"to bow in front of a good person
like you to beg for help

433
00:34:15,251 --> 00:34:19,542
"for the unfortunate people
of these arid steppes

434
00:34:19,667 --> 00:34:22,334
"where I am proud to be born.

435
00:34:22,459 --> 00:34:24,084
"I'll be brief.

436
00:34:24,709 --> 00:34:29,417
"Since we heard about your connections
with the wealthy people of the region

437
00:34:29,542 --> 00:34:31,126
"and the administration,

438
00:34:31,626 --> 00:34:38,167
"and we know you are well connected,
even as far away as Istanbul,

439
00:34:38,292 --> 00:34:40,709
"we wanted to tell you
of our situation.

440
00:34:40,834 --> 00:34:44,209
"We would like to thank you,
however you respond.

441
00:34:44,334 --> 00:34:46,084
"Yours sincerely."

442
00:34:52,209 --> 00:34:54,042
So, well...

443
00:34:54,167 --> 00:34:55,751
That's it.

444
00:34:57,042 --> 00:34:58,917
I don't know.

445
00:34:59,042 --> 00:35:03,667
She appears to be a well-intentioned,
decent, intelligent girl.

446
00:35:03,792 --> 00:35:06,459
Clearly an idealist, bold and courageous.

447
00:35:07,042 --> 00:35:09,417
Seems like she deserves some support.

448
00:35:09,542 --> 00:35:11,084
What do you think?

449
00:35:20,626 --> 00:35:22,167
Nihal?

450
00:35:25,209 --> 00:35:26,709
Frankly...

451
00:35:28,667 --> 00:35:31,042
it didn't sound to me very...

452
00:35:31,167 --> 00:35:33,709
I get this every day from all over.

453
00:35:34,751 --> 00:35:36,417
OK.

454
00:35:36,542 --> 00:35:39,667
What exactly didn't sound right to you?

455
00:35:39,792 --> 00:35:41,251
Well...

456
00:35:41,376 --> 00:35:45,584
Isn't it a bit of a luxury
to build a new place just for this?

457
00:35:46,376 --> 00:35:48,626
It's a tiny village after all.

458
00:35:48,751 --> 00:35:52,334
Normally the mukhtar
gives a space for these things.

459
00:35:52,459 --> 00:35:56,001
You decorate it a bit and you manage.

460
00:35:57,376 --> 00:36:00,792
So I felt it sounded a bit too much.

461
00:36:00,917 --> 00:36:03,917
Even the municipality
refused to help them.

462
00:36:04,042 --> 00:36:08,584
We'll have a hard time
finding common sense in municipal decisions.

463
00:36:13,042 --> 00:36:14,876
Well, I don't know.

464
00:36:15,834 --> 00:36:16,917
And you, Suavi?

465
00:36:17,751 --> 00:36:20,042
I really don't know.

466
00:36:20,167 --> 00:36:24,084
Don't you think you and I,
and a few other local worthies

467
00:36:24,209 --> 00:36:26,042
could get together?

468
00:36:26,167 --> 00:36:28,542
Dear Aydin,
do I really look like a worthy?

469
00:36:28,667 --> 00:36:32,584
My belly is my only worthy feature,
and it's now independent.

470
00:36:34,084 --> 00:36:35,084
However,

471
00:36:37,751 --> 00:36:40,209
I must say you surprised me, Nihal.

472
00:36:40,834 --> 00:36:42,167
Why?

473
00:36:43,001 --> 00:36:44,792
Well...

474
00:36:44,917 --> 00:36:49,917
Because thanks to you this hotel
has been run like a charity for years.

475
00:36:50,626 --> 00:36:52,709
What are you trying to say?

476
00:36:52,834 --> 00:36:54,292
Well...

477
00:36:55,501 --> 00:36:57,459
When a chronic philanthropist,

478
00:36:57,584 --> 00:37:01,001
who has helped
almost every school in the area,

479
00:37:01,126 --> 00:37:05,292
opposes this idea so firmly,
I fail to understand.

480
00:37:05,417 --> 00:37:07,501
What is there to understand?

481
00:37:07,626 --> 00:37:09,792
It's a matter of urgency.

482
00:37:09,917 --> 00:37:13,876
There are primary schools
with leaky roofs and rotten windows.

483
00:37:14,001 --> 00:37:16,917
Little kids studying
with their gloves on.

484
00:37:17,042 --> 00:37:20,417
Isn't it more logical
to solve these problems first?

485
00:37:21,459 --> 00:37:25,376
We've been collecting donations for this
for a long time now.

486
00:37:25,501 --> 00:37:28,292
But it never attracted your attention.

487
00:37:28,417 --> 00:37:31,959
So I don't understand
your sudden charity.

488
00:37:35,084 --> 00:37:38,209
Anyway, I'm expecting guests.
I have to go.

489
00:37:38,334 --> 00:37:43,001
Mr Suavi, could you come and see me
for a minute before you leave?

490
00:37:43,126 --> 00:37:44,584
Sure. I'll drop by.

491
00:37:44,709 --> 00:37:47,751
Then I won't say goodbye.
See you shortly.

492
00:38:04,667 --> 00:38:06,709
You know what?

493
00:38:08,292 --> 00:38:12,167
All this poverty and hardship
is like a natural disaster.

494
00:38:13,292 --> 00:38:16,209
In a sense, it's the will of God.

495
00:38:16,334 --> 00:38:18,667
You can't oppose destiny.

496
00:38:18,792 --> 00:38:23,126
But God also gave us intelligence
to fight such things.

497
00:38:23,917 --> 00:38:25,209
That's true.

498
00:38:26,084 --> 00:38:27,792
That's true, however...

499
00:38:29,334 --> 00:38:33,167
there are people
specially created for such tasks.

500
00:38:33,292 --> 00:38:36,126
You should leave these tasks to them.

501
00:38:36,251 --> 00:38:39,084
You're a creative man.
You are an artist.

502
00:38:39,209 --> 00:38:41,751
Why bother yourself with such things?

503
00:38:42,626 --> 00:38:44,709
Stick to your own work.

504
00:38:50,501 --> 00:38:52,251
Mr Aydin, Hamdi is here.

505
00:38:52,376 --> 00:38:54,876
- Who's Hamdi?
- Hamdi hodja, the imam.

506
00:38:56,209 --> 00:38:58,001
Fine, I was leaving anyway.

507
00:38:58,126 --> 00:38:59,876
Stay a little bit more.

508
00:39:00,001 --> 00:39:02,376
I have loads of work to do.

509
00:39:02,501 --> 00:39:05,501
Loads of work to do on the farm.

510
00:39:05,626 --> 00:39:08,459
I'll show Suavi out.
Bring Hamdi hodja in here.

511
00:39:08,584 --> 00:39:09,584
All right.

512
00:39:49,917 --> 00:39:51,459
Welcome, Hamdi hodja.

513
00:39:51,584 --> 00:39:53,459
Thank you, Mr Aydin.

514
00:39:54,792 --> 00:39:58,084
You could've kept your shoes on.
It's not that clean.

515
00:39:58,209 --> 00:40:02,042
No, Mr Aydin. My shoes got muddy.
It's better like this.

516
00:40:02,167 --> 00:40:04,667
- Some slippers then.
- No, I'm fine.

517
00:40:04,792 --> 00:40:08,501
Hold on.
The floor is very cold in here.

518
00:40:14,542 --> 00:40:18,959
Fatma, bring me a pair of slippers.
And some tea and cookies.

519
00:40:19,084 --> 00:40:20,167
OK.

520
00:40:22,376 --> 00:40:24,626
Take a seat, Hamdi hodja.

521
00:40:32,084 --> 00:40:34,542
Yes, Hamdi hodja. I'm listening.

522
00:40:34,667 --> 00:40:38,292
To tell you the truth,
I don't know where to begin.

523
00:40:38,417 --> 00:40:42,126
When you came the other day,
it was a bit...

524
00:40:42,251 --> 00:40:43,417
Sorry, just a minute.

525
00:40:43,542 --> 00:40:46,626
It's a bit stuffy in here.
If you don't mind...

526
00:40:47,209 --> 00:40:48,876
I'll open a window.

527
00:40:54,876 --> 00:40:56,501
Yes?

528
00:40:56,626 --> 00:40:59,626
Honestly, I don't know how to put it.

529
00:40:59,751 --> 00:41:03,084
It was embarrassing for us,
I'm sorry, but...

530
00:41:03,209 --> 00:41:05,251
we didn't mean badly, of course.

531
00:41:05,376 --> 00:41:09,709
The kid made a mistake because
he was upset by what happened.

532
00:41:09,834 --> 00:41:12,251
But he's just a kid, after all.

533
00:41:12,376 --> 00:41:14,001
Of course, he is.

534
00:41:14,126 --> 00:41:16,917
But have you asked him why he did it?

535
00:41:17,626 --> 00:41:20,501
After all, the incident

536
00:41:20,626 --> 00:41:24,167
could have had quite serious consequences.

537
00:41:25,334 --> 00:41:27,376
Yes, of course, I asked him.

538
00:41:27,501 --> 00:41:28,917
And what did he say?

539
00:41:30,917 --> 00:41:33,251
Well, Mr Aydin...

540
00:41:33,376 --> 00:41:35,959
the kid was upset by the debt collector,

541
00:41:36,084 --> 00:41:38,792
so he went and did such a stupid thing.

542
00:41:38,917 --> 00:41:42,167
Especially seeing his father get beaten up.

543
00:41:42,292 --> 00:41:44,001
Beaten up?

544
00:41:44,126 --> 00:41:47,626
When the debt collectors came,

545
00:41:47,751 --> 00:41:51,501
Ismail tried to stop them obviously.

546
00:41:51,626 --> 00:41:53,834
And the police were there.

547
00:41:53,959 --> 00:41:56,376
So things got out of hand.

548
00:41:56,501 --> 00:41:58,584
I see.

549
00:42:00,251 --> 00:42:03,959
So our car paid the price, right?

550
00:42:04,084 --> 00:42:07,334
More or less, Mr Aydin.
I apologise.

551
00:42:07,459 --> 00:42:10,959
But now the boy
feels really bad about it.

552
00:42:11,084 --> 00:42:14,584
He wants to come over
and kiss your hand for forgiveness.

553
00:42:14,709 --> 00:42:16,459
No. No need for that.

554
00:42:16,584 --> 00:42:19,542
He regrets it. Really.

555
00:42:19,667 --> 00:42:24,001
But as I said the other day,
we always pay our debts.

556
00:42:24,126 --> 00:42:26,459
I actually have some money now.

557
00:42:26,584 --> 00:42:29,876
So I came to pay for the car window.

558
00:42:30,001 --> 00:42:31,834
How much was it?

559
00:42:31,959 --> 00:42:34,792
It doesn't matter.

560
00:42:35,501 --> 00:42:40,042
Sort it out with Hidayet.
I don't know much about it.

561
00:42:40,167 --> 00:42:42,876
I think it was 70 liras or something.

562
00:42:43,001 --> 00:42:45,001
But it's best you talk with Hidayet.

563
00:42:45,751 --> 00:42:47,667
70 liras?

564
00:42:47,792 --> 00:42:51,084
70 liras for just one window?

565
00:42:52,626 --> 00:42:53,917
That's right.

566
00:42:54,667 --> 00:42:57,584
And it is not the brand-name one.
If it had been...

567
00:42:58,459 --> 00:43:01,334
Hidayet can show you the bill.

568
00:43:02,334 --> 00:43:03,584
Well...

569
00:43:04,501 --> 00:43:06,417
I'm not sure if I have enough on me.

570
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:09,667
Let me just ask Hidayet
how much it was.

571
00:43:11,501 --> 00:43:14,584
It's no big deal.
There's no rush.

572
00:43:14,709 --> 00:43:19,001
After all, it's just a window.

573
00:43:20,501 --> 00:43:22,126
You think so?

574
00:43:22,251 --> 00:43:25,417
In that case,
I'd better not pay in instalments.

575
00:43:25,542 --> 00:43:28,251
I'll pay it all in one go, then.

576
00:43:28,376 --> 00:43:30,417
Just to prevent any confusion.

577
00:43:31,876 --> 00:43:33,459
- <i>Hello.</i>
- You there?

578
00:43:35,209 --> 00:43:39,959
Nothing, I just wanted to ask
how much the window cost.

579
00:43:40,084 --> 00:43:42,417
I remember you saying 70 liras.

580
00:43:45,167 --> 00:43:46,792
Really?

581
00:43:46,917 --> 00:43:49,959
I got it wrong then.
OK, all right.

582
00:43:50,792 --> 00:43:53,501
Fine, no problem. Never mind.

583
00:43:54,251 --> 00:43:58,042
I was wrong. It's 170, not 70.

584
00:43:59,584 --> 00:44:01,167
170 liras?

585
00:44:02,209 --> 00:44:04,042
But how come?

586
00:44:04,167 --> 00:44:06,167
That's how much it cost.

587
00:44:08,001 --> 00:44:10,292
Hidayet can show you the bill.

588
00:44:11,167 --> 00:44:14,042
I forgot to ask
if he took a bill though.

589
00:44:14,167 --> 00:44:15,917
That's strange.

590
00:44:16,834 --> 00:44:19,001
It's just a window.

591
00:44:19,126 --> 00:44:20,126
Really strange.

592
00:44:20,251 --> 00:44:23,834
There must be some mistake, surely.

593
00:44:30,417 --> 00:44:33,126
What's this?
Are there no men's slippers?

594
00:44:33,251 --> 00:44:35,834
No, we don't use any at the hotel.

595
00:44:35,959 --> 00:44:37,584
Fatma had these at home.

596
00:44:37,709 --> 00:44:42,042
No worries, these will do.
As long as they keep the cold off.

597
00:44:42,917 --> 00:44:44,876
Where shall I put the tea?

598
00:44:46,876 --> 00:44:49,459
Here. Let me move this.

599
00:44:50,334 --> 00:44:53,292
Hamdi hodja, come here.

600
00:45:01,417 --> 00:45:02,751
Thank you.

601
00:45:18,584 --> 00:45:21,542
Now, Hamdi, listen...

602
00:45:22,792 --> 00:45:26,626
I've got various houses
and shops in town.

603
00:45:26,751 --> 00:45:28,501
Not just mine actually...

604
00:45:28,626 --> 00:45:31,626
They're my sister Necla's too.

605
00:45:31,751 --> 00:45:35,001
If I tried to look after them all myself,

606
00:45:35,126 --> 00:45:39,584
I'd have no time
to work on my book and articles.

607
00:45:39,709 --> 00:45:41,292
See what I mean?

608
00:45:41,417 --> 00:45:47,001
So I let Hidayet and the lawyers
deal with the rent and lawsuits.

609
00:45:48,542 --> 00:45:51,209
I often don't even know
what they're doing.

610
00:45:51,334 --> 00:45:53,751
And if they tell me,
I tend to forget.

611
00:45:54,501 --> 00:45:57,751
The other day,
your younger or older brother...

612
00:45:57,876 --> 00:45:59,292
Older.

613
00:45:59,417 --> 00:46:01,917
He said some inappropriate things.

614
00:46:02,042 --> 00:46:04,542
But I insist...

615
00:46:04,667 --> 00:46:06,167
not to mention the debt collectors.

616
00:46:06,792 --> 00:46:10,584
I wasn't even aware
you were my tenants.

617
00:46:11,376 --> 00:46:16,126
When the rent is not paid,
lawyers do these things automatically.

618
00:46:17,042 --> 00:46:18,126
Understand?

619
00:46:18,251 --> 00:46:21,209
Of course, Mr Aydin. It's obvious.

620
00:46:21,334 --> 00:46:23,542
You have to do these things.

621
00:46:23,667 --> 00:46:26,751
You've been very patient with us.

622
00:46:26,876 --> 00:46:30,459
But, since Ismail came out of prison,

623
00:46:30,584 --> 00:46:32,959
he hasn't sorted himself out yet.

624
00:46:33,084 --> 00:46:35,001
Nobody gives him a job.

625
00:46:35,126 --> 00:46:38,459
I don't see why not, but they don't.

626
00:46:38,584 --> 00:46:42,376
That's why we need time
to get back on our feet.

627
00:46:43,084 --> 00:46:46,959
So, Mr Aydin,
if you could just step in

628
00:46:47,084 --> 00:46:50,084
to stop the eviction...

629
00:46:50,209 --> 00:46:53,626
We will sort something out
as soon as possible.

630
00:46:53,751 --> 00:46:55,792
We really don't want to lose the house.

631
00:46:55,917 --> 00:46:59,584
I spent my entire childhood in that house.

632
00:46:59,709 --> 00:47:02,042
So if you could give us more time...

633
00:47:02,167 --> 00:47:04,251
What do you expect me to say?

634
00:47:04,376 --> 00:47:06,501
I see your point but...

635
00:47:08,501 --> 00:47:10,251
you need to discuss it with Hidayet.

636
00:47:10,376 --> 00:47:13,001
I don't know anything about it.

637
00:47:14,709 --> 00:47:16,084
Did you talk to him?

638
00:47:16,209 --> 00:47:18,459
- No.
- Talk to Hidayet.

639
00:47:18,584 --> 00:47:20,001
I mean...

640
00:47:20,126 --> 00:47:23,959
There's Hidayet and the lawyers.
You don't need to come to me.

641
00:47:24,084 --> 00:47:26,376
They know more about it.

642
00:47:28,001 --> 00:47:30,501
Don't come to me again.

643
00:47:31,167 --> 00:47:34,334
I don't want to mislead you.

644
00:47:39,209 --> 00:47:42,459
<i>In a country with a 99% Muslim population,</i>

645
00:47:42,584 --> 00:47:45,542
<i>don't the people deserve men of God</i>

646
00:47:46,209 --> 00:47:47,876
who are cultivated, neat,

647
00:*****,001 --> 00:47:52,126
whose very presence is reassuring?

648
00:47:53,584 --> 00:47:56,792
The weekly sermon prepared by our imams,

649
00:47:56,917 --> 00:48:00,751
from their reading,

650
00:48:00,876 --> 00:48:04,001
will be heard
with pleasure and admiration

651
00:48:04,126 --> 00:48:06,209
and will elevate the people.

652
00:48:06,334 --> 00:48:10,667
Islam is a religion
of civilisation and high culture.

653
00:48:17,792 --> 00:48:18,792
How's that?

654
00:48:19,917 --> 00:48:21,542
Fine.

655
00:48:21,667 --> 00:48:23,667
It's not too harsh?

656
00:48:23,792 --> 00:48:24,834
No.

657
00:48:24,959 --> 00:48:28,667
- Nothing that might be misunderstood?
- No.

658
00:48:29,459 --> 00:48:32,709
You don't say anything
about religion itself.

659
00:48:32,834 --> 00:48:36,917
You talk about the practices
of those who apply it.

660
00:48:37,042 --> 00:48:40,626
And I also say
Islam is a religion of high culture.

661
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:42,417
Of course.

662
00:48:42,542 --> 00:48:45,126
I don't really care for these things.

663
00:48:48,209 --> 00:48:49,959
But you know it's delicate.

664
00:48:52,126 --> 00:48:55,626
But the guy annoys me so much,
I can't stop myself writing.

665
00:48:56,751 --> 00:49:00,126
So he managed to become
the subject of an article.

666
00:49:00,251 --> 00:49:05,167
With his shabbiness, slyness, vagueness...

667
00:49:05,292 --> 00:49:06,584
You know...

668
00:49:09,626 --> 00:49:13,626
I once played an imam in a play
and got good reviews.

669
00:49:13,751 --> 00:49:17,751
Now when I see him,
I tend to think I wasn't that good.

670
00:49:17,876 --> 00:49:20,917
I missed so many details.

671
00:49:22,667 --> 00:49:24,084
Did you see that play?

672
00:49:25,167 --> 00:49:26,792
Sorry? Which play?

673
00:49:26,917 --> 00:49:28,959
The one where I played an imam.

674
00:49:29,084 --> 00:49:30,709
"Wounded Birds".

675
00:49:31,167 --> 00:49:32,376
Can't remember.

676
00:49:32,501 --> 00:49:36,251
He comes running out in the first scene,
bursting for the toilet.

677
00:49:38,334 --> 00:49:41,209
It must have been when I was abroad.

678
00:49:41,334 --> 00:49:44,334
He comes running on:
"Where's the loo?"

679
00:49:45,334 --> 00:49:48,376
- No. Was it a comedy?
- Yes.

680
00:49:49,917 --> 00:49:52,792
- And first...
- I don't remember.

681
00:49:57,626 --> 00:49:59,876
I want to ask you something.

682
00:50:01,501 --> 00:50:03,709
Not resisting evil...

683
00:50:04,626 --> 00:50:05,709
What does that mean to you?

684
00:50:08,417 --> 00:50:09,626
What?

685
00:50:10,251 --> 00:50:14,417
Not resisting evil, I said.
What do you think that means?

686
00:50:15,834 --> 00:50:17,417
Not resisting evil?

687
00:50:18,751 --> 00:50:20,542
How do you understand it?

688
00:50:21,001 --> 00:50:22,376
Well...

689
00:50:22,501 --> 00:50:26,251
One day, thieves attack you
and you don't resist.

690
00:50:26,376 --> 00:50:28,084
I suppose that's it.

691
00:50:28,209 --> 00:50:31,834
I don't want an example.
Give me a logical definition.

692
00:50:32,584 --> 00:50:34,626
I wonder if there is any logic in it.

693
00:50:34,751 --> 00:50:37,459
A logical definition of not resisting evil.

694
00:50:38,251 --> 00:50:40,292
Not resisting evil is...

695
00:50:41,376 --> 00:50:44,334
to remain indifferent
to incidents defined as evil

696
00:50:44,459 --> 00:50:47,292
within an ethical framework.

697
00:50:47,417 --> 00:50:48,626
How's that?

698
00:50:50,126 --> 00:50:51,876
For instance, if we were to...

699
00:50:52,459 --> 00:50:54,792
make this idea of not resisting evil

700
00:50:55,542 --> 00:50:57,584
the basis of our behaviour,

701
00:50:57,709 --> 00:51:00,042
what kind of life would we have?

702
00:51:00,167 --> 00:51:02,084
What kind of life?

703
00:51:03,376 --> 00:51:04,876
What would it be like?

704
00:51:05,001 --> 00:51:07,209
Thieves, murderers, psychos would prosper.

705
00:51:07,334 --> 00:51:09,834
Chaos would reign everywhere.

706
00:51:11,376 --> 00:51:13,626
- What would be left, then?
- Left?

707
00:51:14,459 --> 00:51:18,667
Cripples and madhouses.
How should I know?

708
00:51:19,459 --> 00:51:21,834
Maybe you're right.

709
00:51:21,959 --> 00:51:25,292
But I couldn't take
the easy way out like you.

710
00:51:25,417 --> 00:51:27,626
What easy way out?

711
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:31,334
Maybe you should think about it.

712
00:51:31,459 --> 00:51:33,709
You went a bit too fast.

713
00:51:33,834 --> 00:51:36,292
I didn't. It's simple.

714
00:51:36,417 --> 00:51:39,542
Someone does wrong, you don't resist.
That's it.

715
00:51:39,667 --> 00:51:40,959
What else is there?

716
00:51:42,001 --> 00:51:43,209
<i>I still feel...</i>

717
00:51:43,334 --> 00:51:46,792
we're fooling ourselves
when we're fighting evil.

718
00:51:46,917 --> 00:51:50,917
As if we didn't want to look
at every aspect, we hide some.

719
00:51:51,042 --> 00:51:52,667
Like what?

720
00:51:52,792 --> 00:51:55,667
Fatma, this honey is frozen.
You got another?

721
00:51:55,792 --> 00:51:58,751
- I'll check.
- If not, just put it in warm water.

722
00:51:58,876 --> 00:52:03,667
Instead of struggling against evil,
why not do the exact opposite?

723
00:52:03,792 --> 00:52:06,876
Say you don't want
a painting to be stolen.

724
00:52:07,001 --> 00:52:10,001
It's maybe better
to hand it to the thief.

725
00:52:10,126 --> 00:52:12,126
Maybe it's a better solution.

726
00:52:12,251 --> 00:52:14,501
Say I want to marry an heiress

727
00:52:14,626 --> 00:52:16,667
because her father is rich.

728
00:52:16,792 --> 00:52:22,334
To foil my sneaky plot,
she should throw herself in my arms. Is that it?

729
00:52:22,834 --> 00:52:25,834
But maybe he would be ashamed, feel remorse

730
00:52:25,959 --> 00:52:27,792
and admit his fault.

731
00:52:27,917 --> 00:52:29,626
Shouldn't we allow for that?

732
00:52:29,751 --> 00:52:31,542
What a ridiculous idea!

733
00:52:31,667 --> 00:52:36,126
Should we allow mass murders
because some killers could regret it?

734
00:52:36,792 --> 00:52:39,834
Even soaps don't produce such nonsense.

735
00:52:39,959 --> 00:52:43,001
Well, I don't care what you think.
I have my solution.

736
00:52:43,751 --> 00:52:48,376
I see no reason to resist an evil act
aimed at me personally.

737
00:52:49,126 --> 00:52:52,042
Does someone want to kill me?
Be my guest.

738
00:52:53,126 --> 00:52:56,876
Because, if I were to defend myself,

739
00:52:57,001 --> 00:52:59,751
that wouldn't make the murderer
a better person.

740
00:53:02,792 --> 00:53:04,792
But if you defend yourself,
you may not die.

741
00:53:04,917 --> 00:53:06,251
Isn't that worth it?

742
00:53:06,376 --> 00:53:08,292
Trust me, it isn't.

743
00:53:09,001 --> 00:53:11,876
Let's drop it.
I feel depressed already.

744
00:53:12,001 --> 00:53:13,417
What do you think, Nihal?

745
00:53:13,542 --> 00:53:16,251
To be honest...
I don't quite grasp it.

746
00:53:16,376 --> 00:53:19,042
Where does this need come from?

747
00:53:19,167 --> 00:53:21,126
Why do you feel like this?

748
00:53:21,251 --> 00:53:24,459
It's not a need, just an idea.

749
00:53:24,584 --> 00:53:26,876
She wants to help evil get done.

750
00:53:27,001 --> 00:53:30,459
Hold on... Is that how you want
to end evil in the world?

751
00:53:30,584 --> 00:53:33,292
Or do you want to find peace that way?

752
00:53:33,417 --> 00:53:37,251
She wants to help the baddies
do bad more comfortably.

753
00:53:37,376 --> 00:53:40,959
I'm just saying
we should give evildoers a chance

754
00:53:41,084 --> 00:53:42,876
to feel regret.

755
00:53:43,001 --> 00:53:45,167
A chance for the bad guys, great!

756
00:53:45,709 --> 00:53:47,501
You pretend not to understand.

757
00:53:47,626 --> 00:53:49,459
That's how I understood it, sweetie.

758
00:53:49,584 --> 00:53:51,251
How did you manage that, sweetie?

759
00:53:51,376 --> 00:53:54,959
She's saying evildoers regret it
if you help them do it?

760
00:53:55,084 --> 00:53:57,251
- No...
- That's what I understand.

761
00:53:57,376 --> 00:53:59,459
How can you understand that?

762
00:53:59,584 --> 00:54:01,334
So how do you understand it?

763
00:54:01,459 --> 00:54:04,959
It is very clear what she's saying.

764
00:54:05,084 --> 00:54:10,459
If someone does me harm,
a thief or someone...

765
00:54:10,584 --> 00:54:13,251
I don't resist and by doing so,

766
00:54:13,376 --> 00:54:15,084
stir his conscience...

767
00:54:15,209 --> 00:54:18,709
Stop it.
What's got into you two this morning?

768
00:54:18,834 --> 00:54:21,709
What's this about helping evildoers do evil?

769
00:54:21,834 --> 00:54:23,417
Who said that?

770
00:54:23,542 --> 00:54:26,167
Is that how you plan to end evil?

771
00:54:26,292 --> 00:54:28,292
You're trying to provoke us now.

772
00:54:28,417 --> 00:54:31,292
I'm just saying what I understood.
Am I wrong?

773
00:54:31,417 --> 00:54:33,751
It's easy to understand.

774
00:54:33,876 --> 00:54:36,626
She says if something bad
is done to us,

775
00:54:36,751 --> 00:54:42,292
by not resisting, the evildoer
may be sorry and give up.

776
00:54:42,417 --> 00:54:43,959
Is that possible?

777
00:54:44,084 --> 00:54:45,667
That's not the question.

778
00:54:45,792 --> 00:54:47,626
I'm just saying one could try.

779
00:54:47,751 --> 00:54:50,459
So the Jews should deport themselves.

780
00:54:50,584 --> 00:54:52,584
So that Hitler doesn't get tired.

781
00:54:53,459 --> 00:54:56,459
He'd say "Here they are,
no point gassing them"?

782
00:54:56,584 --> 00:54:59,334
- You joking?
- No. That's what I understand.

783
00:54:59,959 --> 00:55:03,251
Help evildoers do evil
so they stop doing evil.

784
00:55:03,876 --> 00:55:06,501
Never heard such nonsense before!
I misunderstand...

785
00:55:07,542 --> 00:55:10,251
or you aren't making yourself clear enough.

786
00:55:10,917 --> 00:55:11,917
Mr Aydin,

787
00:55:12,751 --> 00:55:14,084
they're here again.

788
00:55:14,209 --> 00:55:15,667
- Who?
- Hamdi.

789
00:55:15,792 --> 00:55:18,876
- What Hamdi? Hamdi hodja?
- Yes.

790
00:55:19,001 --> 00:55:21,542
- He's here?
- Yes, he's upstairs.

791
00:55:21,667 --> 00:55:23,459
What for?
He already came the other day.

792
00:55:23,584 --> 00:55:25,751
I don't know, he won't say.

793
00:55:25,876 --> 00:55:27,667
He's acting all mysterious.

794
00:55:27,792 --> 00:55:29,209
Not him, not now.

795
00:55:29,334 --> 00:55:31,209
Did you tell him I'm here?

796
00:55:31,334 --> 00:55:33,501
Of course not. I said I'd see.

797
00:55:33,626 --> 00:55:36,584
If he wants to leave something,
you take it.

798
00:55:36,709 --> 00:55:39,751
He came yesterday too.
He didn't leave anything.

799
00:55:41,542 --> 00:55:43,167
- Yesterday, too?
- Yes.

800
00:55:43,292 --> 00:55:44,334
Why didn't you tell me?

801
00:55:44,917 --> 00:55:46,459
We talked about it. You were in bed.

802
00:55:46,584 --> 00:55:48,709
You had me say you weren't in.

803
00:55:50,876 --> 00:55:51,876
Really?

804
00:55:52,001 --> 00:55:54,376
- That boy is here too.
- What boy?

805
00:55:54,501 --> 00:55:56,209
The window one.

806
00:55:57,001 --> 00:56:00,584
- He was here yesterday, too.
- I begin to smell trouble.

807
00:56:00,709 --> 00:56:03,709
Why not speak to him?
They've come all that way.

808
00:56:03,834 --> 00:56:05,376
What's so frightening?

809
00:56:05,501 --> 00:56:07,001
Nothing. It's not that, my dear.

810
00:56:07,126 --> 00:56:10,542
But he's whiney, annoying,
never finishes a sentence.

811
00:56:10,667 --> 00:56:13,917
But they're here now.
We can't send them away.

812
00:56:16,167 --> 00:56:18,084
All right. Let them in.

813
00:56:18,209 --> 00:56:20,292
Let's see what he's after.

814
00:56:21,042 --> 00:56:24,001
I'll do it your way
to see if I got you right.

815
00:56:24,126 --> 00:56:25,251
Hamdi's coming.

816
00:56:25,376 --> 00:56:27,584
I'll say yes to everything he wants.

817
00:56:27,709 --> 00:56:30,917
- But he has done no evil to you.
- Maybe he will.

818
00:56:31,042 --> 00:56:34,084
We don't know why he's here yet.
But I won't protest.

819
00:56:34,209 --> 00:56:36,251
Evil or good, let's see...

820
00:56:36,376 --> 00:56:38,084
- A knife in his pocket?
- Who knows?

821
00:56:42,042 --> 00:56:44,001
Come in, Hamdi hodja, welcome.

822
00:56:44,709 --> 00:56:47,042
Welcome, Mr Hamdi.

823
00:56:47,167 --> 00:56:48,251
Thank you.

824
00:56:48,376 --> 00:56:51,167
Sorry for disturbing you during breakfast.

825
00:56:51,292 --> 00:56:53,709
You're not disturbing us at all.

826
00:56:53,834 --> 00:56:55,792
Would you like some breakfast?

827
00:56:55,917 --> 00:56:59,084
Thank you, madam. We're not hungry.

828
00:56:59,209 --> 00:57:02,584
Please have a seat.
Fatma, some tea for our guests.

829
00:57:03,626 --> 00:57:05,042
And cookies for the boy.

830
00:57:05,167 --> 00:57:06,834
The valley is muddy.

831
00:57:06,959 --> 00:57:09,792
I'm sorry, we're covered in mud.

832
00:57:09,917 --> 00:57:11,417
Why were you in the valley?

833
00:57:11,542 --> 00:57:14,209
- Which way did you take?
- We took the shortcut.

834
00:57:14,334 --> 00:57:17,542
I saw two figures over there.
Was that you?

835
00:57:17,667 --> 00:57:20,126
- Probably.
- Really.

836
00:57:20,251 --> 00:57:22,667
You walked all the way from town?

837
00:57:23,542 --> 00:57:25,542
Yes, we did. Why?

838
00:57:26,251 --> 00:57:29,167
It's quite a long way.

839
00:57:30,876 --> 00:57:32,501
Yes, it's far.

840
00:57:32,626 --> 00:57:34,209
It is. Isn't it?

841
00:57:36,417 --> 00:57:39,042
Did you walk the last time too?

842
00:57:39,709 --> 00:57:41,376
I mean yesterday.

843
00:57:41,501 --> 00:57:42,709
Yes.

844
00:57:43,501 --> 00:57:44,917
My goodness.

845
00:57:45,042 --> 00:57:47,042
Why didn't you say so?

846
00:57:47,959 --> 00:57:50,626
Hidayet could have given you a lift back.

847
00:57:51,292 --> 00:57:53,209
I feel sorry now.

848
00:57:53,334 --> 00:57:55,209
No need to apologise.

849
00:57:55,334 --> 00:57:59,209
It's like exercise for us.
Don't worry.

850
00:58:01,001 --> 00:58:02,751
Aydin, show them a seat...

851
00:58:03,792 --> 00:58:06,209
Fatma, bring my tea over there.

852
00:58:06,334 --> 00:58:08,334
Please have a seat.

853
00:58:09,376 --> 00:58:11,001
You don't even have a moped?

854
00:58:11,459 --> 00:58:14,876
I'll get one when things
start looking up.

855
00:58:15,001 --> 00:58:17,251
- That would be great.
- God willing.

856
00:58:17,376 --> 00:58:20,959
Luckily the house is next to the mosque.

857
00:58:21,084 --> 00:58:24,959
Five round trips a day
would have been hard.

858
00:58:25,084 --> 00:58:26,501
God bless you.

859
00:58:26,959 --> 00:58:28,292
Is he your son?

860
00:58:28,417 --> 00:58:30,334
- He looks like you.
- No.

861
00:58:30,459 --> 00:58:32,834
He's my nephew. My brother's son.

862
00:58:33,959 --> 00:58:35,584
I don't have any children.

863
00:58:35,709 --> 00:58:39,626
Struggling to make ends meet,
I couldn't get married.

864
00:58:39,751 --> 00:58:41,459
My fate, I guess.

865
00:58:41,584 --> 00:58:44,042
You will eventually.
You're still young.

866
00:58:44,167 --> 00:58:46,751
But Ilyas is like a son to me.

867
00:58:46,876 --> 00:58:49,584
Of course.
Which class are you in, Ilyas?

868
00:58:51,501 --> 00:58:53,167
Speak up, son, which grade?

869
00:58:54,126 --> 00:58:55,792
Fifth.

870
00:58:57,376 --> 00:58:58,376
Mr Aydin...

871
00:58:59,376 --> 00:59:01,084
I'm off to the industrial zone.

872
00:59:01,209 --> 00:59:04,334
- What for?
- To get the car door fixed.

873
00:59:04,459 --> 00:59:06,334
What's so urgent about it?

874
00:59:06,459 --> 00:59:08,834
Nothing. But the engine too
is making a noise.

875
00:59:08,959 --> 00:59:12,751
- What noise?
- A kind of "zheeee".

876
00:59:12,876 --> 00:59:16,834
Could be the cylinders.
I don't want to ruin the engine.

877
00:59:19,126 --> 00:59:20,876
All right, go.

878
00:59:34,917 --> 00:59:36,959
Mr Aydin, as I said before...

879
00:59:37,084 --> 00:59:40,501
after that incident,
the boy felt terribly sorry.

880
00:59:40,626 --> 00:59:43,251
- Which incident?
- That stone he threw.

881
00:59:43,376 --> 00:59:45,209
That's over and done with.

882
00:59:45,334 --> 00:59:48,376
I mean... the poor boy feels so bad,

883
00:59:48,501 --> 00:59:52,084
he's been all upset and worried ever since.

884
00:59:53,626 --> 00:59:56,501
Now, Mr Aydin, apologising is not easy.

885
00:59:56,626 --> 00:59:59,959
As for repentance,
it's a matter of maturity.

886
01:00:00,084 --> 01:00:02,792
But while there's still resentment,

887
01:00:02,917 --> 01:00:05,501
one can't feel truly at peace.

888
01:00:05,626 --> 01:00:08,001
Our Prophet said,

889
01:00:08,126 --> 01:00:10,751
"Repentance is penitence."

890
01:00:10,876 --> 01:00:15,917
If a person convinces you
that they're really sorry,

891
01:00:16,042 --> 01:00:20,459
then we have no choice
except to forgive them.

892
01:00:20,584 --> 01:00:22,167
That's how it is.

893
01:00:22,292 --> 01:00:26,209
And our Ilyas is such a smart
and golden-hearted boy

894
01:00:26,334 --> 01:00:29,334
that young as he is, he listened to me.

895
01:00:29,459 --> 01:00:31,792
He thought about it and agreed.

896
01:00:31,917 --> 01:00:34,709
That's why he wanted to come today

897
01:00:34,834 --> 01:00:36,792
to kiss your hand.

898
01:00:36,917 --> 01:00:39,334
I said, "That would be
the right thing, my boy."

899
01:00:39,459 --> 01:00:44,917
"You'll see, show regret
and Mr Aydin will surely forgive you."

900
01:00:45,042 --> 01:00:46,126
Right?

901
01:00:46,251 --> 01:00:49,959
It's really not necessary.
It doesn't matter at all.

902
01:00:50,084 --> 01:00:53,001
Of course it's necessary.

903
01:00:53,126 --> 01:00:57,584
Otherwise he'll get away
with what he's done.

904
01:00:58,501 --> 01:01:00,251
That's the biggest danger.

905
01:01:00,376 --> 01:01:02,876
Ilyas? Isn't that right, my dear?

906
01:01:04,084 --> 01:01:06,667
I don't like getting my hand kissed.

907
01:01:06,792 --> 01:01:08,709
My father never allowed it either.

908
01:01:08,834 --> 01:01:12,084
We'd struggle to kiss his hand.
Wouldn't we, Necla?

909
01:01:12,209 --> 01:01:14,709
No. He can't find real peace then.

910
01:01:14,834 --> 01:01:16,501
Isn't that so, dear?

911
01:01:16,626 --> 01:01:19,709
Come on now, son,
kiss Mr Aydin's hand.

912
01:01:28,459 --> 01:01:29,751
Ilyas?

913
01:01:29,876 --> 01:01:34,126
Didn't we say we'd go and do this
without telling your dad?

914
01:01:34,251 --> 01:01:37,042
Don't embarrass me in front of everyone.

915
01:01:37,167 --> 01:01:41,001
Come on, son. Kiss Mr Aydin's hand.

916
01:01:41,126 --> 01:01:42,917
Fine, then.

917
01:01:53,667 --> 01:01:56,542
Ilyas, come on.
Mr Aydin is waiting.

918
01:03:02,042 --> 01:03:04,251
Don't pull, keep it loose.

919
01:03:20,209 --> 01:03:22,167
Pull now.

920
01:03:27,042 --> 01:03:28,709
Let it rest a bit.

921
01:03:42,792 --> 01:03:44,501
Don't get too close.

922
01:05:49,792 --> 01:05:51,959
Oh, it's freezing.

923
01:05:52,084 --> 01:05:54,251
I'm chilled to the bone.

924
01:05:59,417 --> 01:06:01,001
What are you doing?

925
01:06:01,792 --> 01:06:03,376
Not much.

926
01:06:06,917 --> 01:06:08,459
Where's Aydin?

927
01:06:10,251 --> 01:06:11,876
No idea.

928
01:06:12,001 --> 01:06:15,001
Must have gone into town.
He's not in his room?

929
01:06:15,126 --> 01:06:16,501
No, he isn't.

930
01:06:39,251 --> 01:06:42,126
I'll make more coffee.
Want some?

931
01:06:44,417 --> 01:06:46,209
Coffee, I said, want some?

932
01:06:48,001 --> 01:06:50,042
Yes, I'll have one.

933
01:06:51,126 --> 01:06:54,667
I don't know what to do
with the new maid, Nihal.

934
01:06:54,792 --> 01:06:57,459
She put glasses I love in the dishwasher.

935
01:06:57,584 --> 01:06:59,001
Two got smashed.

936
01:06:59,126 --> 01:07:00,626
I know, she told me.

937
01:07:00,751 --> 01:07:05,667
They're obviously too thin for the dishwasher.
They broke.

938
01:07:05,792 --> 01:07:09,209
I'm thinking of taking it out of her wages
to teach her.

939
01:07:09,334 --> 01:07:11,626
That's a bit much. Forget it.

940
01:07:11,751 --> 01:07:16,417
I'm not exaggerating.
There are things you love and value.

941
01:07:16,542 --> 01:07:19,917
I bought them in Istanbul.
You can't get them anymore.

942
01:07:20,042 --> 01:07:23,751
I know, but they're just glasses.

943
01:07:26,251 --> 01:07:28,834
Maybe you're right. I don't know.

944
01:07:35,626 --> 01:07:37,751
No, maybe you're right.

945
01:07:39,709 --> 01:07:43,292
I'm aware I'm a bit nervy lately.

946
01:07:46,792 --> 01:07:48,292
It's because I worry too much.

947
01:07:49,167 --> 01:07:51,167
Worry about what?

948
01:07:51,292 --> 01:07:53,917
There's so much going around in my head.

949
01:07:56,126 --> 01:07:58,876
My ex has become a real alcoholic.

950
01:07:59,001 --> 01:08:01,834
- Who? Necdet?
- Yes.

951
01:08:01,959 --> 01:08:04,584
But he always drank a lot, didn't he?

952
01:08:04,709 --> 01:08:07,001
He did indeed, but...

953
01:08:08,001 --> 01:08:11,292
he's been drinking much more
since we separated.

954
01:08:12,042 --> 01:08:14,459
He starts the minute he gets up.

955
01:08:17,417 --> 01:08:19,792
But there's nothing you can do about that.

956
01:08:20,251 --> 01:08:21,626
I know...

957
01:08:21,751 --> 01:08:23,542
but sometimes...

958
01:08:24,376 --> 01:08:28,292
I can't help thinking
we're worse off after splitting up.

959
01:08:28,834 --> 01:08:32,667
Him over there in that state,
me here miserable.

960
01:08:32,792 --> 01:08:35,751
- Is that what you really think?
- Well...

961
01:08:38,417 --> 01:08:42,167
Maybe I'm just trying to figure out
where I went wrong.

962
01:08:42,667 --> 01:08:44,542
What I did that made us
end up like this.

963
01:08:44,667 --> 01:08:46,751
But if you've still found nothing

964
01:08:46,876 --> 01:08:49,709
years later,
maybe it's not your fault at all.

965
01:08:50,501 --> 01:08:52,084
Don't you agree?

966
01:08:52,209 --> 01:08:54,126
You want me to join the herd

967
01:08:54,251 --> 01:08:58,167
that believes all badness comes from others?

968
01:08:58,292 --> 01:09:02,167
No, but it still doesn't have
to be "your" mistake.

969
01:09:02,292 --> 01:09:03,917
That's what I'm saying.

970
01:09:04,042 --> 01:09:06,667
Why do you never want
to think like that?

971
01:09:06,792 --> 01:09:10,167
Because I don't see any good in it.

972
01:09:10,292 --> 01:09:15,292
A sensible person should only be interested
in her own share of guilt.

973
01:09:15,417 --> 01:09:19,542
I see no harm in some self-deception
to protect yourself.

974
01:09:19,667 --> 01:09:21,709
But, well...

975
01:09:23,001 --> 01:09:25,209
Where do you think you're wrong?

976
01:09:25,334 --> 01:09:27,376
I don't know but...

977
01:09:28,167 --> 01:09:30,167
I'm just saying it as an example...

978
01:09:30,751 --> 01:09:36,584
If I'd overlooked all the evil stuff
Necdet did to me,

979
01:09:39,626 --> 01:09:41,667
if I hadn't resisted,

980
01:09:43,042 --> 01:09:45,417
if I hadn't divorced him, say.

981
01:09:48,334 --> 01:09:52,251
If I could have made him
face his own evil side.

982
01:09:52,792 --> 01:09:54,042
I don't know.

983
01:09:54,709 --> 01:09:59,001
I wonder what would've happened
if I had acted differently.

984
01:09:59,126 --> 01:10:03,709
You mean, if you hadn't resisted
all the bad things he did,

985
01:10:03,834 --> 01:10:06,584
he would've finally felt ashamed?

986
01:10:06,709 --> 01:10:08,126
Yes.

987
01:10:08,251 --> 01:10:11,459
Yes. Exactly. You put it well.

988
01:10:13,251 --> 01:10:16,667
I know it sounds absurd,
but it isn't, believe me.

989
01:10:16,792 --> 01:10:20,959
Sorry, Necla,
but I find it hard to believe.

990
01:10:21,084 --> 01:10:24,667
People don't change that much
after a certain age.

991
01:10:24,792 --> 01:10:29,001
On the contrary,
all their bad habits get even worse.

992
01:10:29,709 --> 01:10:32,417
So remaining silent in the face of evil

993
01:10:32,542 --> 01:10:37,834
does nothing but make the other feel
even more justified.

994
01:10:37,959 --> 01:10:40,084
I think he regrets it now, too.

995
01:10:41,626 --> 01:10:43,334
That's why I say this.

996
01:10:43,459 --> 01:10:45,167
I feel it.

997
01:10:46,584 --> 01:10:50,459
If he could find an excuse,
he'd come here right away.

998
01:10:50,584 --> 01:10:55,084
If I were living somewhere else,
he'd definitely do that.

999
01:10:57,251 --> 01:10:59,334
But after all that happened,

1000
01:11:00,626 --> 01:11:03,459
he is a bit scared of Aydin now.

1001
01:11:06,459 --> 01:11:09,126
But you know
what I sometimes feel like?

1002
01:11:12,834 --> 01:11:14,667
Going and asking him for forgiveness.

1003
01:11:16,334 --> 01:11:17,542
Necdet?

1004
01:11:18,667 --> 01:11:20,042
Yes.

1005
01:11:22,417 --> 01:11:24,292
But you did nothing wrong.

1006
01:11:24,417 --> 01:11:25,834
Precisely.

1007
01:11:26,376 --> 01:11:28,709
In fact, that's the beauty of it.

1008
01:11:29,542 --> 01:11:31,834
Making the other really ashamed.

1009
01:11:32,584 --> 01:11:35,751
And in this way,
maybe bringing out the good in him.

1010
01:11:41,626 --> 01:11:45,626
Necla, have you been watching
too many soap operas recently?

1011
01:11:47,167 --> 01:11:48,376
What do you mean?

1012
01:11:48,501 --> 01:11:51,042
Such things only happen there.

1013
01:11:53,542 --> 01:11:55,584
There's nothing to say.

1014
01:11:56,126 --> 01:11:57,709
It's your decision.

1015
01:11:57,834 --> 01:11:59,917
I think it's utter nonsense,

1016
01:12:00,042 --> 01:12:05,042
but if that's what you want to do
nobody is going to stop you.

1017
01:12:05,167 --> 01:12:06,709
You can do what you like.

1018
01:12:08,042 --> 01:12:11,584
But then, you're the one
who has to face the consequences.

1019
01:12:11,709 --> 01:12:13,459
Keep that in mind, too.

1020
01:12:14,376 --> 01:12:15,792
That's how I see it.

1021
01:12:30,417 --> 01:12:34,001
Those petty, multiple-meaning,
sarcastic words,

1022
01:12:35,626 --> 01:12:38,376
and those little,
cynical lip movements.

1023
01:12:39,542 --> 01:12:42,917
I realise now how sick I am of it,
how much I hate it.

1024
01:12:44,209 --> 01:12:46,001
Necla, you're going too far. Please.

1025
01:12:46,126 --> 01:12:48,792
The real reason I'd apologise to Necdet

1026
01:12:48,917 --> 01:12:52,376
is maybe to get away
from all of you and all of this.

1027
01:12:52,501 --> 01:12:54,459
It's pretty clear now.

1028
01:12:55,792 --> 01:12:58,834
Nobody is going to stop me?
Of course not.

1029
01:12:59,501 --> 01:13:01,876
I don't need anybody's permission for that.

1030
01:13:02,542 --> 01:13:04,834
This is my father's house too.

1031
01:13:04,959 --> 01:13:07,251
I'll stay or go as I please.

1032
01:13:09,584 --> 01:13:11,334
Besides...

1033
01:13:11,459 --> 01:13:16,042
I've already paid the price
for telling the truth to your face.

1034
01:13:17,334 --> 01:13:19,709
A price none of you has paid.

1035
01:13:32,417 --> 01:13:34,626
Isn't that Omar Sharif?

1036
01:13:34,751 --> 01:13:36,042
What?

1037
01:13:37,542 --> 01:13:39,334
The photo. It's Omar Sharif?

1038
01:13:39,459 --> 01:13:42,376
Yes. They shot a movie here.

1039
01:13:42,501 --> 01:13:43,626
At this hotel?

1040
01:13:43,751 --> 01:13:45,834
No, I mean in this area.

1041
01:13:45,959 --> 01:13:47,959
He's such a humble man.

1042
01:13:48,084 --> 01:13:50,292
He'd take a picture with anybody.

1043
01:13:50,417 --> 01:13:51,792
- Really?
- Yes.

1044
01:13:51,917 --> 01:13:54,459
You don't expect that of a big star.

1045
01:13:54,584 --> 01:13:55,834
But he's not like that.

1046
01:13:55,959 --> 01:13:57,876
What film was it?

1047
01:13:58,001 --> 01:14:01,334
I can't remember.
I don't want to mislead you.

1048
01:14:01,876 --> 01:14:03,626
Hello.

1049
01:14:04,626 --> 01:14:08,834
What was the movie
Omar Sharif shot here?

1050
01:14:08,959 --> 01:14:11,417
- "Monsieur Ibrahim".
- That's it.

1051
01:14:11,542 --> 01:14:15,167
I've heard about it.
Where exactly did they shoot it?

1052
01:14:15,792 --> 01:14:18,292
Around here.
In Ishtar and other places.

1053
01:14:18,417 --> 01:14:19,876
- Ishtar?
- Yes.

1054
01:14:20,001 --> 01:14:21,459
Interesting.

1055
01:14:21,584 --> 01:14:23,792
Let's see where it is.

1056
01:14:26,917 --> 01:14:28,334
Where is everybody?

1057
01:14:29,709 --> 01:14:33,792
You mean Mrs Nihal and Necla?
They were here a minute ago.

1058
01:14:34,792 --> 01:14:36,042
Doing what?

1059
01:14:36,167 --> 01:14:37,626
Talking.

1060
01:14:38,292 --> 01:14:40,834
- Here, in the lobby.
- Really?

1061
01:14:40,959 --> 01:14:44,084
I went out and when I came back,
they'd left.

1062
01:14:44,834 --> 01:14:46,501
Were they talking normally?

1063
01:14:47,459 --> 01:14:49,459
What do you mean "normally"?

1064
01:14:51,792 --> 01:14:53,126
Whatever.

1065
01:14:53,251 --> 01:14:56,376
- Would you like some tea?
- Please.

1066
01:14:56,501 --> 01:14:58,251
Could you make us some tea?

1067
01:15:03,251 --> 01:15:06,042
Ishtar is very near.
Right opposite Akky.

1068
01:15:06,167 --> 01:15:09,334
No, I found it.
It's 20 kilometres away.

1069
01:15:09,459 --> 01:15:12,584
Well done, you know better than us.

1070
01:15:13,917 --> 01:15:15,417
No, I don't.

1071
01:15:17,001 --> 01:15:18,542
What do you do?

1072
01:15:18,667 --> 01:15:21,334
I mean what's your job?
Are you a guide?

1073
01:15:21,459 --> 01:15:23,792
No, I'm not.

1074
01:15:24,667 --> 01:15:26,209
I explore.

1075
01:15:27,001 --> 01:15:29,126
Isn't a motorbike hard in winter?

1076
01:15:29,251 --> 01:15:31,751
The harder it is the better we like it.

1077
01:15:32,334 --> 01:15:33,792
Who's "We"?

1078
01:15:34,667 --> 01:15:35,792
Motocross bikers.

1079
01:15:35,917 --> 01:15:37,334
I see.

1080
01:15:41,292 --> 01:15:44,042
I did something like that
in my student days.

1081
01:15:44,167 --> 01:15:45,251
Really?

1082
01:15:45,376 --> 01:15:47,959
Hitchhiked across Europe with friends.

1083
01:15:48,084 --> 01:15:52,167
When the going got tough
we hopped on a train.

1084
01:15:53,251 --> 01:15:55,292
Those were the days.

1085
01:15:57,876 --> 01:15:59,792
Sleeping wherever we ended up.

1086
01:16:00,501 --> 01:16:03,542
The world was our oyster.

1087
01:16:04,792 --> 01:16:06,834
It felt like life would never end.

1088
01:16:09,376 --> 01:16:11,417
Full of the energy of youth.

1089
01:16:11,542 --> 01:16:13,584
I don't care much for hitchhiking.

1090
01:16:14,459 --> 01:16:16,584
I need to be more self-sufficient.

1091
01:16:16,709 --> 01:16:20,001
I should always have the gear
to get by.

1092
01:16:20,667 --> 01:16:23,001
That's why a bike suits me better.

1093
01:16:24,084 --> 01:16:26,584
So you check into a hotel for the night?

1094
01:16:26,709 --> 01:16:30,792
I have a tent and stuff
but I didn't want to pitch it here.

1095
01:16:32,167 --> 01:16:34,292
This place is a bit like a cave

1096
01:16:34,417 --> 01:16:36,251
and natural like a tent.

1097
01:16:37,209 --> 01:16:39,667
And I also had some stuff to write.

1098
01:16:39,792 --> 01:16:41,334
Really? What are you writing?

1099
01:16:41,459 --> 01:16:43,001
My experiences.

1100
01:16:44,459 --> 01:16:45,876
Like a travel journal?

1101
01:16:46,001 --> 01:16:49,292
There are travel notes as well.

1102
01:16:49,417 --> 01:16:51,084
Let's call them essays.

1103
01:16:52,126 --> 01:16:54,084
Soon to be published as a book.

1104
01:16:54,209 --> 01:16:56,042
Really? That's good.

1105
01:16:58,417 --> 01:17:00,084
I'm writing a book, too.

1106
01:17:00,584 --> 01:17:02,001
Really?

1107
01:17:02,126 --> 01:17:05,084
It will be a serious, thick book.

1108
01:17:08,167 --> 01:17:10,126
History of Turkish Theatre.

1109
01:17:11,792 --> 01:17:14,334
There is no serious study on the topic.

1110
01:17:14,459 --> 01:17:15,584
Unfortunately.

1111
01:17:15,709 --> 01:17:18,751
So I'm doing research.
There's loads to read.

1112
01:17:18,876 --> 01:17:21,459
Old documents, articles,
books and so on.

1113
01:17:21,584 --> 01:17:24,917
I've nearly finished,
all I have to do now is start writing.

1114
01:17:26,376 --> 01:17:30,042
- "Getting started is half the job."
- That's true.

1115
01:17:31,917 --> 01:17:35,376
- You used to be an actor, I believe.
- That's right.

1116
01:17:35,501 --> 01:17:37,084
That explains your topic.

1117
01:17:37,209 --> 01:17:38,501
Yes, that's right.

1118
01:17:38,626 --> 01:17:41,209
I prefer the term 'thespian' though.

1119
01:17:41,334 --> 01:17:44,459
Acting has fallen from grace
a little lately.

1120
01:17:45,251 --> 01:17:47,542
I was on stage for 25 years.

1121
01:17:48,334 --> 01:17:51,667
And I am proud to say
I never did any soap operas.

1122
01:17:52,501 --> 01:17:55,209
Despite some very attractive offers.

1123
01:17:58,376 --> 01:18:01,001
I remember something Omar Sharif told me.

1124
01:18:01,126 --> 01:18:04,251
When we met, he learned I was an actor.

1125
01:18:04,376 --> 01:18:06,709
He gave me this look and said,

1126
01:18:07,709 --> 01:18:10,876
"Acting is all about honesty."

1127
01:18:12,042 --> 01:18:14,001
It really is.

1128
01:18:15,751 --> 01:18:16,917
Awesome.

1129
01:18:21,001 --> 01:18:23,334
- By the way, we got a horse.
- Really?

1130
01:18:23,459 --> 01:18:24,917
Can I ride it now?

1131
01:18:25,042 --> 01:18:26,959
Not yet.
It has to settle in a few days.

1132
01:18:27,084 --> 01:18:29,501
How long will you be staying?

1133
01:18:29,626 --> 01:18:31,251
- Here?
- Yes.

1134
01:18:31,376 --> 01:18:32,626
Don't know.

1135
01:18:32,751 --> 01:18:34,376
I haven't decided yet.

1136
01:18:35,084 --> 01:18:36,792
I live from day to day.

1137
01:18:36,917 --> 01:18:39,459
I don't plan ahead much.

1138
01:18:40,417 --> 01:18:43,251
Otherwise it's not a real journey anymore.

1139
01:18:43,376 --> 01:18:46,126
You lose the sense of adventure.

1140
01:18:46,667 --> 01:18:48,126
How can I put it?

1141
01:18:49,501 --> 01:18:54,334
The way a well-planned life
doesn't feel like a real life.

1142
01:18:54,459 --> 01:18:55,917
As the saying goes,

1143
01:18:56,042 --> 01:18:59,292
life passes by
while we're busy making plans.

1144
01:19:01,376 --> 01:19:03,167
True. Very true.

1145
01:19:44,209 --> 01:19:47,167
Weren't you going to the market with Fatma?

1146
01:19:51,167 --> 01:19:54,209
I told Fatma to go.
I didn't feel like it.

1147
01:19:59,501 --> 01:20:02,001
Have you finished the book I lent you?

1148
01:20:04,251 --> 01:20:06,001
A while ago.

1149
01:20:06,834 --> 01:20:08,001
So?

1150
01:20:09,292 --> 01:20:10,667
What did you think?

1151
01:20:11,209 --> 01:20:13,042
Worth translating?

1152
01:20:14,459 --> 01:20:17,459
No, I don't think it's worth the bother.

1153
01:20:29,667 --> 01:20:32,584
If I'm not interrupting,
can I ask you something?

1154
01:20:32,709 --> 01:20:38,084
Of course. But please,
nothing about not resisting evil, OK?

1155
01:20:40,292 --> 01:20:42,126
I found a good source.

1156
01:20:42,251 --> 01:20:45,167
I should finish this
and send it quick.

1157
01:20:46,876 --> 01:20:50,209
Judging from your excitement,
you struck gold.

1158
01:20:50,334 --> 01:20:52,292
Not really.

1159
01:20:52,417 --> 01:20:56,334
It's a sequel to my previous article.
It aroused lots of interest.

1160
01:20:57,001 --> 01:20:58,751
- Really?
- Yes.

1161
01:20:59,626 --> 01:21:01,209
So Vehbi said.

1162
01:21:02,084 --> 01:21:05,042
He said the paper got
abusive phone calls.

1163
01:21:08,667 --> 01:21:11,126
You know Vehbi.

1164
01:21:11,792 --> 01:21:13,876
He loves to exaggerate reactions

1165
01:21:14,001 --> 01:21:17,042
to make his paper look influential.

1166
01:21:17,876 --> 01:21:20,126
The article wasn't provocative.

1167
01:21:22,209 --> 01:21:23,876
I agree, but...

1168
01:21:24,709 --> 01:21:26,751
I'm not so sure.

1169
01:21:28,667 --> 01:21:31,626
Why do you get involved in such things
in the first place?

1170
01:21:32,834 --> 01:21:35,667
You're an actor.
Write what you know about.

1171
01:21:36,334 --> 01:21:39,751
But dear Necla,
often you don't choose what you write.

1172
01:21:39,876 --> 01:21:41,709
In a sense, the subject chooses you.

1173
01:21:41,834 --> 01:21:46,834
Of course everyone has the right
to talk or write about what they like.

1174
01:21:47,292 --> 01:21:51,417
But you have to accept that
the product will match its maker.

1175
01:21:51,542 --> 01:21:52,667
Meaning?

1176
01:21:52,792 --> 01:21:56,667
I mean there will be a big difference
between the views

1177
01:21:56,792 --> 01:21:58,584
of a lifelong expert

1178
01:21:58,709 --> 01:22:00,292
and an amateur's.

1179
01:22:00,417 --> 01:22:04,417
But can't an outsider
sometimes see things more clearly?

1180
01:22:04,542 --> 01:22:06,251
Frankly, not in this case.

1181
01:22:07,542 --> 01:22:08,834
Which case?

1182
01:22:08,959 --> 01:22:11,501
Let me put it like this.
The other day...

1183
01:22:11,626 --> 01:22:14,209
I carefully read that article you gave me.

1184
01:22:14,334 --> 01:22:17,376
Then I couldn't stop
and read some others.

1185
01:22:17,501 --> 01:22:18,751
And?

1186
01:22:19,667 --> 01:22:23,001
I probably hadn't paid
enough attention before...

1187
01:22:23,667 --> 01:22:25,376
but they felt quite different this time.

1188
01:22:26,084 --> 01:22:27,626
Different in what sense?

1189
01:22:28,501 --> 01:22:29,667
I don't know.

1190
01:22:31,667 --> 01:22:32,959
Has Nihal read them?

1191
01:22:33,834 --> 01:22:35,334
No, I don't think so.

1192
01:22:35,459 --> 01:22:38,126
She doesn't care much for my articles.

1193
01:22:38,251 --> 01:22:40,667
Shouldn't a wife read
what her husband writes?

1194
01:22:41,751 --> 01:22:43,584
I don't know. Should she?

1195
01:22:44,667 --> 01:22:46,584
Maybe she reads them in secret.

1196
01:22:46,709 --> 01:22:47,917
I believe she does.

1197
01:22:50,167 --> 01:22:53,501
She's an expert at criticising
by remaining silent.

1198
01:22:53,626 --> 01:22:57,084
I don't believe
she'd be objective enough anyway.

1199
01:22:57,209 --> 01:22:58,417
Whatever.

1200
01:22:59,501 --> 01:23:01,626
- So?
- Well, honestly,

1201
01:23:02,251 --> 01:23:04,584
I probably couldn't be so daring.

1202
01:23:04,709 --> 01:23:06,084
About what?

1203
01:23:07,209 --> 01:23:08,876
I mean...

1204
01:23:09,001 --> 01:23:13,667
Pontificating in a column
on matters I don't know much about.

1205
01:23:13,792 --> 01:23:15,376
Pontificating?

1206
01:23:17,042 --> 01:23:19,709
I see you found my articles
worse than I thought.

1207
01:23:19,834 --> 01:23:23,292
No. I'm not saying they're bad...

1208
01:23:24,251 --> 01:23:26,126
It's something else.

1209
01:23:26,251 --> 01:23:27,584
Something else?

1210
01:23:27,709 --> 01:23:29,709
Like what?

1211
01:23:30,542 --> 01:23:32,376
I mean, they're like...

1212
01:23:33,959 --> 01:23:36,417
Mediocre? Bloodless?

1213
01:23:36,542 --> 01:23:38,417
I can't find the right term.

1214
01:23:38,542 --> 01:23:40,126
Harmless.

1215
01:23:40,917 --> 01:23:42,834
Is that what you mean?

1216
01:23:43,334 --> 01:23:45,167
I don't know. Maybe.

1217
01:23:48,667 --> 01:23:50,917
Your words are sweeter than honey today.

1218
01:23:51,709 --> 01:23:54,084
I'm trying to be realistic.

1219
01:23:54,209 --> 01:23:56,251
Well, bravo, what else can I say?

1220
01:23:57,042 --> 01:23:59,501
If you want,
I can stop being realistic.

1221
01:24:02,709 --> 01:24:06,001
Too late.
The genie is out of the bottle.

1222
01:24:07,417 --> 01:24:09,501
Well, if you ask for opinions

1223
01:24:09,626 --> 01:24:12,209
you have to face the consequences.

1224
01:24:12,334 --> 01:24:14,792
What can I say? That's true.

1225
01:24:22,501 --> 01:24:24,792
In the old days, we admired you.

1226
01:24:28,084 --> 01:24:29,917
We thought

1227
01:24:30,042 --> 01:24:33,251
you'd do great things,
become quite famous even.

1228
01:24:35,417 --> 01:24:37,167
But it didn't happen.

1229
01:24:40,001 --> 01:24:42,251
The elephant gave birth to a mouse.

1230
01:24:44,584 --> 01:24:46,959
Sorry to disappoint you.

1231
01:24:47,084 --> 01:24:49,459
That's obviously not your fault.

1232
01:24:51,042 --> 01:24:53,334
It's us who set the bar so high.

1233
01:24:53,459 --> 01:24:56,459
So I should feel comforted.

1234
01:24:58,209 --> 01:25:00,292
What about "Flowers of the Steppes"?

1235
01:25:01,209 --> 01:25:02,334
What did you think of it?

1236
01:25:02,459 --> 01:25:04,334
To be honest,

1237
01:25:04,459 --> 01:25:08,209
that's the article
that actually made me think like this.

1238
01:25:11,334 --> 01:25:12,709
Really? In what way?

1239
01:25:13,251 --> 01:25:16,667
How can I put it?
This soppy romanticism.

1240
01:25:16,792 --> 01:25:21,042
This naive, unconvincing self-belief.

1241
01:25:21,667 --> 01:25:23,209
Takes no risks, for one thing.

1242
01:25:24,334 --> 01:25:26,334
It looks like the writer

1243
01:25:27,084 --> 01:25:30,417
adopts positive values accepted by all,

1244
01:25:30,542 --> 01:25:32,542
just to endear himself.

1245
01:25:33,376 --> 01:25:35,667
Sometimes the disguise of lyricism

1246
01:25:35,792 --> 01:25:39,167
makes it stink of sentimentality.

1247
01:25:41,042 --> 01:25:43,626
You really are annoyed.

1248
01:25:43,751 --> 01:25:45,917
I must confess
I don't like this style much.

1249
01:25:46,042 --> 01:25:50,084
If what you say is true,
I should just quit writing.

1250
01:25:51,417 --> 01:25:54,042
No, dean.
This is just my point of view.

1251
01:25:54,167 --> 01:25:57,709
Luckily not everybody thinks like you.

1252
01:25:58,584 --> 01:26:00,251
Naturally.

1253
01:26:03,876 --> 01:26:05,334
Who are they?

1254
01:26:07,001 --> 01:26:09,042
I see you're curious.

1255
01:26:09,167 --> 01:26:11,667
No. It's just because you mentioned it.

1256
01:26:13,376 --> 01:26:16,459
- I haven't offended you, have I?
- Not at all.

1257
01:26:17,417 --> 01:26:18,917
Are you sure?

1258
01:26:22,834 --> 01:26:24,417
Maybe a little.

1259
01:26:25,126 --> 01:26:29,001
A writer can be very sensitive
regarding his work.

1260
01:26:29,584 --> 01:26:31,751
But don't worry, I can handle it.

1261
01:26:31,876 --> 01:26:36,167
But dear, you're not coming up
with coherent, constructive criticism.

1262
01:26:36,292 --> 01:26:39,792
Like your remarks
are always hiding something.

1263
01:26:39,917 --> 01:26:41,626
That's what's annoying.

1264
01:26:41,751 --> 01:26:47,334
So I get to thinking it's me you hate,
not the articles.

1265
01:26:47,459 --> 01:26:49,667
- That's absurd.
- But that's the case.

1266
01:26:50,292 --> 01:26:52,459
And of course,
we've become very different now.

1267
01:26:53,042 --> 01:26:54,417
We must accept that.

1268
01:26:54,542 --> 01:26:57,417
We see things, life itself,
quite differently.

1269
01:26:58,042 --> 01:27:01,209
That's probably natural.

1270
01:27:01,334 --> 01:27:05,001
The older you get,
the more particular, rigid you get.

1271
01:27:05,834 --> 01:27:09,459
After a while, it seems normal
you don't like them.

1272
01:27:10,459 --> 01:27:12,334
That's maybe how it should be.

1273
01:27:12,459 --> 01:27:16,667
In fact, this might even be something
I should be pleased about.

1274
01:27:16,792 --> 01:27:17,792
You see?

1275
01:27:17,917 --> 01:27:19,376
Anyway...

1276
01:27:19,501 --> 01:27:22,751
I don't want to go into it any further.

1277
01:27:26,292 --> 01:27:30,584
It's incredible how you always
float to the surface like olive oil.

1278
01:27:31,292 --> 01:27:34,251
You find a way to justify yourself, as usual.

1279
01:27:34,376 --> 01:27:36,834
Necla, please, can we drop it?

1280
01:27:36,959 --> 01:27:40,376
You wanted to ask me something
when you came in.

1281
01:27:40,501 --> 01:27:43,959
- It's done.
- No. What were you going to ask?

1282
01:27:45,209 --> 01:27:48,792
The subject of the article
you've just sent.

1283
01:27:48,917 --> 01:27:50,667
No, it wasn't that.

1284
01:27:51,251 --> 01:27:52,834
Yes, that's what it was.

1285
01:27:52,959 --> 01:27:57,709
OK. Religion, morals, this and that.
Nothing of your interest.

1286
01:27:57,834 --> 01:27:59,542
Now I see.

1287
01:28:00,292 --> 01:28:03,959
You found a victim
and you're making the most of it.

1288
01:28:04,084 --> 01:28:05,792
Stop harassing the poor man.

1289
01:28:05,917 --> 01:28:07,667
Necla, I'm losing my temper.

1290
01:28:07,792 --> 01:28:09,167
What does it have to do with it?

1291
01:28:09,292 --> 01:28:13,501
I should ask what religion, faith,
spirituality have to do with you.

1292
01:28:13,626 --> 01:28:16,209
Have you ever set foot in a mosque?

1293
01:28:16,334 --> 01:28:18,792
Have you ever prayed
so that you can talk about it?

1294
01:28:18,917 --> 01:28:21,959
Do I have to go to a mosque
to write about religion?

1295
01:28:22,084 --> 01:28:23,292
How absurd is that?

1296
01:28:23,417 --> 01:28:26,917
You keep saying the imam's feet stink.
What's it to you?

1297
01:28:27,459 --> 01:28:30,709
The man walked 10 km in this cold.

1298
01:28:30,834 --> 01:28:33,917
And he had to enter the room
with those feet.

1299
01:28:34,042 --> 01:28:36,584
What exactly are you trying to say?

1300
01:28:36,709 --> 01:28:39,709
You know damn well what I'm saying.

1301
01:28:39,834 --> 01:28:41,167
No, I don't.

1302
01:28:41,292 --> 01:28:42,667
Then let me explain.

1303
01:28:42,792 --> 01:28:46,126
I find it insincere
to talk about spirituality

1304
01:28:46,251 --> 01:28:49,084
when you haven't shed
a single tear on your parents' grave

1305
01:28:49,209 --> 01:28:51,376
and never even visited them.

1306
01:28:51,501 --> 01:28:54,501
There are ways of crying
you don't know, Mrs Necla.

1307
01:28:56,417 --> 01:28:59,001
Fine, all right. Go on then.

1308
01:29:01,042 --> 01:29:04,667
I wish my threshold of self-deception
was as low as yours.

1309
01:29:06,251 --> 01:29:09,584
Then I could easily find things worth doing

1310
01:29:09,709 --> 01:29:12,334
and escape this boredom perhaps.

1311
01:29:14,334 --> 01:29:15,959
I don't understand

1312
01:29:16,084 --> 01:29:19,417
how you don't get fed up
harping on like that.

1313
01:29:20,876 --> 01:29:24,417
Applying yourself, being persistent

1314
01:29:24,542 --> 01:29:29,792
is a precondition to penetrating deeper
and creating new things.

1315
01:29:29,917 --> 01:29:32,542
Second, what boredom are you talking about?

1316
01:29:33,917 --> 01:29:37,542
I've never had a spare second
to feel bored.

1317
01:29:38,959 --> 01:29:43,001
And in the present circumstances,
I believe boredom is quite a luxury.

1318
01:29:43,126 --> 01:29:46,251
So it wasn't a luxury in the past
and now it is?

1319
01:29:46,376 --> 01:29:51,292
Fine, I'll put it like this.
Boredom is always a luxury. Happy?

1320
01:29:53,126 --> 01:29:57,042
We are so different,
we have such opposite souls.

1321
01:29:57,167 --> 01:30:00,001
It's hard to believe we're related.

1322
01:30:00,126 --> 01:30:03,376
That's normal.
Siblings are never alike.

1323
01:30:03,501 --> 01:30:06,959
If one is hardworking, the other is lazy.
One is clever, the other is a fool.

1324
01:30:07,084 --> 01:30:09,626
One is sociable,
the other introverted.

1325
01:30:09,751 --> 01:30:11,167
That's just how it is.

1326
01:30:11,292 --> 01:30:13,501
- So?
- So it's normal.

1327
01:30:14,792 --> 01:30:16,292
I can't believe

1328
01:30:16,417 --> 01:30:20,167
how I left a place like Istanbul

1329
01:30:21,376 --> 01:30:25,126
and agreed to come and live with you.

1330
01:30:26,501 --> 01:30:29,542
My soul's withering here.

1331
01:30:30,167 --> 01:30:33,376
I feel at home
wherever my room and my books are.

1332
01:30:33,501 --> 01:30:35,459
I feel no need for another place.

1333
01:30:35,584 --> 01:30:40,209
You must be able to create a world for yourself,
find an occupation.

1334
01:30:41,084 --> 01:30:44,917
You're bored because you sit around
doing nothing.

1335
01:30:45,042 --> 01:30:46,376
You've really let yourself go.

1336
01:30:46,501 --> 01:30:48,501
You used to do translations.

1337
01:30:48,626 --> 01:30:50,209
You stopped even that.

1338
01:30:50,334 --> 01:30:51,751
Of course you're bored.

1339
01:30:51,876 --> 01:30:53,709
We must work, have a passion.

1340
01:30:54,542 --> 01:30:58,626
You know what they say,
an idle life is far from honour and honesty.

1341
01:31:01,209 --> 01:31:04,042
It depends on how you define "working".

1342
01:31:04,167 --> 01:31:08,042
It doesn't mean running around pointlessly.

1343
01:31:08,167 --> 01:31:10,251
So what does it mean?

1344
01:31:11,001 --> 01:31:14,501
People who think a lot are actually
more active than the others.

1345
01:31:14,626 --> 01:31:16,001
Even if they don't do anything.

1346
01:31:16,126 --> 01:31:19,459
So you mean you're busy thinking.

1347
01:31:21,376 --> 01:31:23,709
Maybe I don't know what to do.

1348
01:31:23,834 --> 01:31:26,542
I've no passion to give me direction.

1349
01:31:27,376 --> 01:31:29,417
But then, what do you do?

1350
01:31:29,542 --> 01:31:34,584
You waste your best years
with things that are irrelevant to you.

1351
01:31:35,667 --> 01:31:39,917
Are you not tired of tinkering uselessly,
like an alchemist?

1352
01:31:43,376 --> 01:31:46,334
Seeing you like this depresses me.

1353
01:31:46,459 --> 01:31:48,876
Necla, what are you raving about,
for God's sake?

1354
01:31:49,334 --> 01:31:51,542
You having a bad night or what?

1355
01:31:51,667 --> 01:31:54,126
The more I try to humour you,
the harsher you get.

1356
01:31:54,251 --> 01:31:56,584
- Calm down.
- Come on, please.

1357
01:31:56,709 --> 01:32:00,209
I'm not surprised you got divorced
after all these years.

1358
01:32:00,334 --> 01:32:03,917
No man would put up
with this sharp tongue of yours.

1359
01:32:06,334 --> 01:32:09,709
- It takes one to know one, so true.
- What do you mean?

1360
01:32:11,126 --> 01:32:13,542
- Well...
- Who are we talking about?

1361
01:32:14,167 --> 01:32:17,334
Your other half.
You're becoming both the same.

1362
01:32:17,459 --> 01:32:20,167
You have to get at Nihal too, right?

1363
01:32:21,167 --> 01:32:24,709
I know what you two think of me.
But I don't care.

1364
01:32:24,834 --> 01:32:27,834
These are my own thoughts,
nothing to do with Nihal.

1365
01:32:27,959 --> 01:32:31,376
She walks around
like she was a guardian angel,

1366
01:32:31,501 --> 01:32:33,792
but in reality, she doesn't do shit.

1367
01:32:33,917 --> 01:32:37,209
Glaring at people with that contemptuous look.

1368
01:32:37,334 --> 01:32:39,542
Are we now guilty
because you do nothing?

1369
01:32:39,667 --> 01:32:42,376
Do something. Nobody's stopping you.

1370
01:32:44,876 --> 01:32:48,501
Charity's now what they call
showing off in this house.

1371
01:32:49,876 --> 01:32:54,084
The salvation ritual of a woman
who's never earned her living.

1372
01:32:54,209 --> 01:32:55,667
God knows what salvation.

1373
01:32:55,792 --> 01:32:58,042
What do you want her to do?

1374
01:32:58,167 --> 01:33:01,417
Philanthropy isn't tossing
a bone to a hungry dog.

1375
01:33:02,417 --> 01:33:05,584
It's sharing it
when you're just as hungry.

1376
01:33:05,709 --> 01:33:10,126
Everybody does what he can, how he can.
What's wrong with that?

1377
01:33:10,251 --> 01:33:13,751
Ask yourself what you get
from this kind of work.

1378
01:33:13,876 --> 01:33:16,459
You're not listening.
What's that got to do with it?

1379
01:33:16,584 --> 01:33:21,334
Others found what you're digging for
in that hole years ago.

1380
01:33:21,459 --> 01:33:24,501
Stop flogging a dead horse.

1381
01:33:24,626 --> 01:33:28,251
It's a waste of time.
Nothing new will come of it.

1382
01:33:28,376 --> 01:33:31,251
So you tell me then.
What is "new"?

1383
01:33:31,376 --> 01:33:33,834
You are the man of ideas, not me.

1384
01:33:33,959 --> 01:33:35,084
I can't teach you.

1385
01:33:35,209 --> 01:33:38,626
I'm interested in the universal,
even if it might not seem new.

1386
01:33:38,751 --> 01:33:39,751
For God's sake, Aydin.

1387
01:33:39,876 --> 01:33:42,709
Be realistic for once. Please.

1388
01:33:43,209 --> 01:33:44,876
Just this once.

1389
01:33:45,001 --> 01:33:47,167
Look who's talking about realism.

1390
01:33:47,292 --> 01:33:50,459
Dealing with art,
struggling for people's spiritual development

1391
01:33:50,584 --> 01:33:52,626
is alchemy, you say?

1392
01:33:52,751 --> 01:33:54,834
No, dear, what I'm saying is this.

1393
01:33:54,959 --> 01:33:58,834
If all you thinkers thought
about solving the big problems,

1394
01:33:58,959 --> 01:34:03,667
all this trivia you fuss about now
would solve itself in the process.

1395
01:34:04,209 --> 01:34:06,917
If you go up in a balloon
to see a town,

1396
01:34:07,042 --> 01:34:10,001
you'll incidentally see the trees,
rivers and meadows too.

1397
01:34:10,501 --> 01:34:13,376
But no, you focus on one tiny spot.

1398
01:34:13,501 --> 01:34:15,501
Lazy, cowardly, conservative.

1399
01:34:15,626 --> 01:34:19,542
We're in an endless cycle again.

1400
01:34:19,667 --> 01:34:22,709
We don't have to agree.
Why do we keep arguing?

1401
01:34:22,834 --> 01:34:24,917
You know what your problem is?

1402
01:34:25,042 --> 01:34:29,292
In order not to suffer,
you prefer to fool yourself.

1403
01:34:29,417 --> 01:34:31,376
Yes, that's it.

1404
01:34:31,876 --> 01:34:36,167
But one has to have the courage
to face the truth.

1405
01:34:36,292 --> 01:34:39,126
If you're looking for something more real,

1406
01:34:39,251 --> 01:34:44,292
you'll have to be destructive
when necessary, dear Aydin.

1407
01:34:44,792 --> 01:34:49,959
But since you're an actor,
you forgot about being real, being yourself.

1408
01:34:51,917 --> 01:34:55,876
You jump from one personality to another,
just like a grasshopper.

1409
01:34:56,001 --> 01:34:59,417
But there's something called
living with yourself.

1410
01:34:59,542 --> 01:35:03,001
So, you want me to be realistic?
All right, listen, then.

1411
01:35:03,126 --> 01:35:07,209
You're a person sentenced
to loneliness and boredom for life.

1412
01:35:07,334 --> 01:35:10,126
Because you're a coward,
because you're lazy.

1413
01:35:10,251 --> 01:35:11,709
- Me?
- Yes.

1414
01:35:11,834 --> 01:35:15,542
You're used to living like a parasite
expecting everyone to help you.

1415
01:35:15,667 --> 01:35:19,459
You act as if the whole world
owes you something.

1416
01:35:19,584 --> 01:35:21,709
- Easy, calm down.
- I'm calm.

1417
01:35:21,834 --> 01:35:27,334
Whatever you do, whatever you say,
you expect indulgence.

1418
01:35:27,459 --> 01:35:30,751
- You think that's possible?
- That's certainly not what I want.

1419
01:35:31,542 --> 01:35:34,042
Where do you get such ideas?

1420
01:35:34,167 --> 01:35:38,042
You're not realistic yourself
without being aware of it.

1421
01:35:38,167 --> 01:35:39,667
- Me?
- Yes.

1422
01:35:40,376 --> 01:35:42,042
Wonderful.

1423
01:35:42,167 --> 01:35:45,626
I swear, every time
you come through that door,

1424
01:35:45,751 --> 01:35:50,042
I find myself praying
you won't say something irritating.

1425
01:35:51,001 --> 01:35:53,292
While you sit silently behind me,

1426
01:35:53,417 --> 01:35:58,167
I feel your gaze on my back,
seeking trouble, just to escape boredom.

1427
01:35:58,292 --> 01:36:00,001
My back goes numb.

1428
01:36:01,334 --> 01:36:02,917
I've got unsuspected powers.

1429
01:36:03,042 --> 01:36:07,501
It's as if somebody
is rubbing his calloused hand on my back.

1430
01:36:08,084 --> 01:36:10,751
I feel cold inside, I can't write.

1431
01:36:10,876 --> 01:36:13,042
Aydin, what are you saying?

1432
01:36:13,167 --> 01:36:15,876
Do you always have to be that irritating?

1433
01:36:17,459 --> 01:36:20,876
- You're angry.
- Look, this drives everybody away.

1434
01:36:21,001 --> 01:36:25,042
No husband, no friend, nobody.
You're left all alone.

1435
01:36:26,376 --> 01:36:27,876
Am I wrong?

1436
01:36:29,292 --> 01:36:32,501
Is that realistic enough,
or shall I continue?

1437
01:36:32,626 --> 01:36:36,459
Yes, that was a very personal realism.
You're right.

1438
01:36:37,792 --> 01:36:39,792
Thinking more important than action.

1439
01:36:42,501 --> 01:36:44,251
There we go.

1440
01:36:44,376 --> 01:36:47,209
The age-old excuse of cowards and slackers.

1441
01:36:47,334 --> 01:36:49,167
Are you counting on that?

1442
01:36:50,917 --> 01:36:53,209
Marvellous tirade.

1443
01:39:46,209 --> 01:39:47,917
- How are you, man?
- Hey, how are you?

1444
01:39:48,042 --> 01:39:49,709
I didn't know you were coming.

1445
01:39:50,251 --> 01:39:51,792
I invited Mr Suavi.

1446
01:39:51,917 --> 01:39:53,876
So I figured.

1447
01:39:54,709 --> 01:39:56,459
Is there a celebration?

1448
01:39:57,209 --> 01:39:59,834
No, we're just having a meeting.

1449
01:39:59,959 --> 01:40:01,751
- A meeting?
- Yes.

1450
01:40:03,042 --> 01:40:06,167
What's the mystery?
Is it an army council meeting?

1451
01:40:06,292 --> 01:40:08,417
Didn't I tell you? I did.

1452
01:40:08,542 --> 01:40:10,084
When?

1453
01:40:11,751 --> 01:40:14,542
I don't know, but I did.
You said "hmm" or something.

1454
01:40:14,667 --> 01:40:17,251
It was odd that you weren't interested.

1455
01:40:17,376 --> 01:40:20,626
I said "hmm"? I don't remember.

1456
01:40:21,584 --> 01:40:24,834
Never mind.
It's nothing to do with you anyway.

1457
01:40:24,959 --> 01:40:26,542
As if you didn't know.

1458
01:40:32,251 --> 01:40:33,709
- Nihal.
- Yes?

1459
01:40:33,834 --> 01:40:35,667
Where exactly did you tell me?

1460
01:40:35,792 --> 01:40:37,167
I don't remember.

1461
01:40:39,334 --> 01:40:42,251
You heard, it's none of your business!

1462
01:40:45,167 --> 01:40:47,209
Shall I take your coat, Mr Aydin?

1463
01:40:50,042 --> 01:40:51,209
Where's Necla?

1464
01:40:51,334 --> 01:40:53,209
In her room.

1465
01:40:53,959 --> 01:40:55,251
Why? Is she upset?

1466
01:40:55,376 --> 01:40:58,042
No. Do you want me to go and see?

1467
01:40:58,167 --> 01:40:59,751
No. Did she come down today?

1468
01:40:59,876 --> 01:41:01,751
Probably.

1469
01:41:01,876 --> 01:41:04,042
In what sense you ask?

1470
01:41:05,042 --> 01:41:06,751
Nothing. Off you go.

1471
01:41:10,626 --> 01:41:12,042
So?

1472
01:41:12,167 --> 01:41:14,542
I thought you never went out.

1473
01:41:14,667 --> 01:41:16,209
I don't really.

1474
01:41:16,334 --> 01:41:19,876
Nihal called me, I couldn't say no.

1475
01:41:25,209 --> 01:41:26,584
Listen...

1476
01:41:26,709 --> 01:41:28,917
Don't let them fleece you.

1477
01:41:29,042 --> 01:41:31,667
They're insatiable.
And you can't say no.

1478
01:41:31,792 --> 01:41:34,542
Look at me.
Do I look that gullible?

1479
01:41:35,167 --> 01:41:37,417
I'm just warning you.
You're an old friend.

1480
01:41:37,542 --> 01:41:40,334
Don't regret it later
and take it out on me.

1481
01:41:40,459 --> 01:41:42,584
Fatma, could you get me a coffee?

1482
01:41:42,709 --> 01:41:44,834
I'll have a coffee and leave.

1483
01:41:44,959 --> 01:41:49,209
- Why do you have to go? Stay.
- No, I don't fancy it.

1484
01:41:49,334 --> 01:41:52,459
- Why don't you stay for a while?
- No, thanks.

1485
01:42:07,626 --> 01:42:10,042
- Welcome, Levent.
- Hello, everyone.

1486
01:42:10,167 --> 01:42:11,917
- How are you?
- Fine.

1487
01:42:12,042 --> 01:42:13,084
Give me your coat.

1488
01:42:13,209 --> 01:42:16,917
Teacher, where were you?
I was about to leave.

1489
01:42:17,042 --> 01:42:20,792
At the army office.
The commandant's wife was there.

1490
01:42:20,917 --> 01:42:21,917
So?

1491
01:42:22,042 --> 01:42:24,334
People are nice to their wives in public.

1492
01:42:24,459 --> 01:42:26,751
But given the chance,

1493
01:42:26,876 --> 01:42:31,251
they'd stuff them in bags
and throw them in the water.

1494
01:42:33,834 --> 01:42:36,126
Hello. I'm Aydin, Nihal's husband.

1495
01:42:36,251 --> 01:42:40,209
Are you? Nice to meet you.
I'm Levent, the teacher.

1496
01:42:40,334 --> 01:42:42,417
- I guessed so.
- Really? How?

1497
01:42:42,542 --> 01:42:45,292
You come often.
I've heard about you.

1498
01:42:45,417 --> 01:42:48,001
I'm not sure what you're doing...

1499
01:42:48,459 --> 01:42:51,626
Mrs Nihal could explain it better,

1500
01:42:51,751 --> 01:42:58,167
but we're collecting donations
to renovate disadvantaged schools.

1501
01:42:58,292 --> 01:43:01,709
Since Mrs Nihal joined,
we've made a lot of progress.

1502
01:43:01,834 --> 01:43:04,626
- That's nice. Bravo.
- Thank you.

1503
01:43:04,751 --> 01:43:06,917
Friends, why don't you sit down?

1504
01:43:07,042 --> 01:43:08,876
Please.

1505
01:43:13,501 --> 01:43:16,167
Levent, what would you like to drink?

1506
01:43:16,292 --> 01:43:20,876
Some of your famous coffee liquor, please.

1507
01:43:21,001 --> 01:43:23,292
Of course. Anyone else?

1508
01:43:23,917 --> 01:43:25,126
Mr Suavi?

1509
01:43:25,251 --> 01:43:27,334
Me too, but later.

1510
01:43:30,209 --> 01:43:33,126
I'll have a tea, Nihal. Thanks.

1511
01:43:41,001 --> 01:43:42,417
Listen, Blent.

1512
01:43:42,542 --> 01:43:45,042
How many local primary schools
are there?

1513
01:43:45,167 --> 01:43:47,209
Levent, not Blent.

1514
01:43:49,542 --> 01:43:52,042
There are three in the centre.

1515
01:43:52,167 --> 01:43:53,792
And how many pupils?

1516
01:43:53,917 --> 01:43:56,584
Well, we have 75...

1517
01:43:57,292 --> 01:43:59,959
plus 150 there.
250-300 in all. Why?

1518
01:44:00,084 --> 01:44:03,709
That's not many.
I thought there would be more.

1519
01:44:03,834 --> 01:44:06,334
Look, it's snowing!

1520
01:44:08,251 --> 01:44:11,542
If it goes on, it'll be difficult
to drive up the slope.

1521
01:44:11,667 --> 01:44:13,084
Aydin...

1522
01:44:14,251 --> 01:44:17,792
Can you come?
There's a problem with a light in the kitchen.

1523
01:44:18,667 --> 01:44:20,167
Coming.

1524
01:44:30,167 --> 01:44:32,917
Which one is it? This one?

1525
01:44:33,667 --> 01:44:36,917
Sorry, that was just an excuse
to bring you here.

1526
01:44:38,792 --> 01:44:41,001
Now, don't take it badly but...

1527
01:44:41,126 --> 01:44:44,459
I must say this is a private meeting.

1528
01:44:45,667 --> 01:44:47,459
So?

1529
01:44:47,584 --> 01:44:51,959
In this meeting,
we'll try to finalise

1530
01:44:52,084 --> 01:44:55,334
months of effort.

1531
01:44:56,959 --> 01:44:58,501
So?

1532
01:44:59,959 --> 01:45:01,834
I'll have to ask you
to leave us alone.

1533
01:45:03,167 --> 01:45:04,917
Discuss whatever you like.

1534
01:45:05,501 --> 01:45:07,417
Are you hiding something from me?

1535
01:45:07,542 --> 01:45:09,792
It's not a matter of secrecy.

1536
01:45:11,584 --> 01:45:14,917
But Nihal, don't you think
you're being a bit impolite?

1537
01:45:15,042 --> 01:45:16,751
Why "impolite"?

1538
01:45:16,876 --> 01:45:20,251
All I'm saying is
that this is a private meeting.

1539
01:45:20,376 --> 01:45:22,917
Nobody in this country would believe it.

1540
01:45:23,042 --> 01:45:25,376
Men everywhere but the husband banned.

1541
01:45:25,501 --> 01:45:27,209
Don't be ridiculous.

1542
01:45:27,334 --> 01:45:31,084
There are women inside.
And some more will come.

1543
01:45:31,209 --> 01:45:35,042
But with you around,
things get complicated, that's all.

1544
01:45:35,167 --> 01:45:37,167
You stick your nose into everything.

1545
01:45:38,042 --> 01:45:41,001
Just let us do things our own way.

1546
01:45:41,792 --> 01:45:46,542
If I organised a meeting like this
and you came in,

1547
01:45:46,667 --> 01:45:49,751
I'd never treat you like this.

1548
01:45:50,917 --> 01:45:53,376
I really don't get it.

1549
01:45:53,501 --> 01:45:55,751
It's beyond my understanding.

1550
01:45:55,876 --> 01:45:57,792
We've been working for a year now.

1551
01:45:57,917 --> 01:46:02,584
You never showed the slightest interest
and you show up at the end.

1552
01:46:02,709 --> 01:46:04,834
I'm the one who doesn't get
what you're after.

1553
01:46:04,959 --> 01:46:06,709
I'm not after anything.

1554
01:46:17,792 --> 01:46:20,792
I'd have soon got it and left anyway.

1555
01:46:22,084 --> 01:46:25,209
What makes me angry is your nerve

1556
01:46:25,792 --> 01:46:27,626
to actually tell me this.

1557
01:46:27,751 --> 01:46:30,209
I didn't say it in front of people.

1558
01:46:30,334 --> 01:46:34,084
I asked you to come here
and I'm asking you nicely.

1559
01:46:34,209 --> 01:46:35,959
What else can I do?

1560
01:46:36,084 --> 01:46:38,042
I don't know.

1561
01:46:38,167 --> 01:46:41,417
But I know very well that
I'd never do such a thing to you.

1562
01:46:42,209 --> 01:46:44,209
That's for sure.

1563
01:46:45,209 --> 01:46:47,376
Playing the old scenes over again.

1564
01:46:48,167 --> 01:46:50,459
I can't stand it.

1565
01:46:52,709 --> 01:46:54,501
All right, then.

1566
01:46:54,626 --> 01:46:56,751
Have it your way.

1567
01:46:56,876 --> 01:46:59,251
I'll leave, you can stay.

1568
01:48:02,542 --> 01:48:04,209
What's up?

1569
01:48:07,251 --> 01:48:09,751
- I'm leaving.
- So soon?

1570
01:48:09,876 --> 01:48:12,167
When you've got to go,
you've got to go.

1571
01:48:12,292 --> 01:48:15,042
There might be black ice.
Could be dangerous.

1572
01:48:15,167 --> 01:48:17,251
I don't mind.

1573
01:48:17,376 --> 01:48:19,042
We love danger.

1574
01:48:20,001 --> 01:48:21,209
Awesome.

1575
01:48:22,251 --> 01:48:25,167
- So where are you heading?
- We'll see.

1576
01:48:25,917 --> 01:48:27,709
Wherever the road takes me.

1577
01:48:28,834 --> 01:48:30,501
Was Hidayet downstairs?

1578
01:48:31,292 --> 01:48:34,376
- Yes, I checked out with him.
- No, that's not what I meant.

1579
01:48:35,167 --> 01:48:37,834
Do you need anything?
Food for the road?

1580
01:48:37,959 --> 01:48:39,376
No, thank you.

1581
01:48:41,542 --> 01:48:42,834
Anyway...

1582
01:48:43,501 --> 01:48:44,792
Fine.

1583
01:48:47,376 --> 01:48:49,459
Have a safe journey.

1584
01:48:49,584 --> 01:48:51,667
- Thank you.
- Don't forget us.

1585
01:49:14,834 --> 01:49:17,126
Nihal, am I disturbing you?

1586
01:49:19,292 --> 01:49:21,126
Don't hide it, I won't look.

1587
01:49:21,251 --> 01:49:23,251
I just wanted to ask something.

1588
01:49:23,376 --> 01:49:24,459
Then ask, Aydin.

1589
01:49:27,459 --> 01:49:30,126
I heard you raised funds last night.

1590
01:49:31,167 --> 01:49:32,584
Is that true?

1591
01:49:32,709 --> 01:49:35,292
Yes, we did. So what?

1592
01:49:36,292 --> 01:49:38,251
Why didn't you tell me?

1593
01:49:38,917 --> 01:49:40,292
Did I have to?

1594
01:49:44,126 --> 01:49:47,542
You didn't have to,
but I'd have appreciated it.

1595
01:49:47,667 --> 01:49:50,834
I might have wanted
to make a significant contribution.

1596
01:49:50,959 --> 01:49:53,584
I don't think it's a good idea.

1597
01:49:55,167 --> 01:49:57,209
We're doing fine on our own.

1598
01:49:57,334 --> 01:49:58,834
We don't need you, thanks.

1599
01:49:58,959 --> 01:50:00,626
Come on.

1600
01:50:01,709 --> 01:50:03,626
One always needs more.

1601
01:50:04,584 --> 01:50:06,959
After all, I'm a wealthy man.

1602
01:50:07,084 --> 01:50:10,667
What's more natural
than helping an educational project?

1603
01:50:11,584 --> 01:50:13,751
But nobody expects anything from you.

1604
01:50:13,876 --> 01:50:16,959
From you neither, darling.

1605
01:50:17,084 --> 01:50:20,959
Yet you created a huge committee
in our house without me knowing.

1606
01:50:21,084 --> 01:50:22,126
Didn't you?

1607
01:50:22,251 --> 01:50:24,292
Listen to me, Aydin, please.

1608
01:50:25,167 --> 01:50:27,209
We've lived in peace for two years,

1609
01:50:27,334 --> 01:50:29,626
each to his own affairs.

1610
01:50:29,751 --> 01:50:31,376
What's suddenly changed?

1611
01:50:33,001 --> 01:50:37,126
Yesterday your aim was
to humiliate me and the guests.

1612
01:50:37,751 --> 01:50:40,251
- Think I didn't notice?
- Me?

1613
01:50:40,376 --> 01:50:41,876
Never even crossed my mind.

1614
01:50:42,001 --> 01:50:43,542
Come on, for God's sake.

1615
01:50:43,667 --> 01:50:46,209
I was so angry,
I couldn't sleep last night.

1616
01:50:47,626 --> 01:50:51,751
If we start fighting and quarrelling again
like we used to,

1617
01:50:51,876 --> 01:50:54,251
then it's clear I can't stay here.

1618
01:51:10,042 --> 01:51:13,167
- Is that a threat?
- Why would I threaten you?

1619
01:51:13,876 --> 01:51:15,667
I'm just saying what could happen.

1620
01:51:18,501 --> 01:51:20,459
OK, say you left.

1621
01:51:21,001 --> 01:51:22,334
Where would you go?

1622
01:51:22,459 --> 01:51:25,001
Wherever I could. I don't know.

1623
01:51:25,126 --> 01:51:26,334
I'd go to Istanbul.

1624
01:51:26,459 --> 01:51:29,209
Find a job and work.

1625
01:51:33,667 --> 01:51:35,959
Nihal, my darling.

1626
01:51:38,209 --> 01:51:42,126
You haven't got tired of banging
the same old drum for years.

1627
01:51:43,459 --> 01:51:45,751
As if I'm keeping you here by force.

1628
01:51:48,251 --> 01:51:50,876
I've never stopped you, have I?

1629
01:51:51,417 --> 01:51:55,251
Go whenever you like.
Maybe you should. Try it.

1630
01:51:55,792 --> 01:51:57,876
Find a job, with the minimum wage.

1631
01:51:58,584 --> 01:52:00,376
From 8 to 6.

1632
01:52:01,251 --> 01:52:05,209
After work, you can go on saving the world,
if you have energy left.

1633
01:52:05,667 --> 01:52:07,251
I'll do it if necessary.

1634
01:52:08,709 --> 01:52:10,834
Much better than wasting my life

1635
01:52:10,959 --> 01:52:13,667
living like a parasite
with an arrogant man like you.

1636
01:52:15,126 --> 01:52:17,834
Thanks to you,
I'm drifting in vain here.

1637
01:52:18,501 --> 01:52:21,792
I'm sponging off you.
I spend your money.

1638
01:52:21,917 --> 01:52:25,876
But I pay for it with my freedom
and my useless loyalty.

1639
01:52:26,667 --> 01:52:30,917
Do you know how donating
even a little of someone else's money feels?

1640
01:52:31,042 --> 01:52:32,084
No, I don't.

1641
01:52:33,084 --> 01:52:34,084
And why?

1642
01:52:34,209 --> 01:52:37,626
Because I've worked like a dog
all my life not to know.

1643
01:52:39,501 --> 01:52:42,126
I couldn't enjoy my childhood or youth.

1644
01:52:45,876 --> 01:52:49,334
Too much of an easy life,
that's your trouble.

1645
01:52:50,834 --> 01:52:53,417
You have no idea what gratitude means.

1646
01:53:07,126 --> 01:53:09,084
Besides, I'm asking you...

1647
01:53:09,667 --> 01:53:14,459
Stop these secret meetings
and gatherings at my house.

1648
01:53:15,792 --> 01:53:18,876
I only allow close acquaintances
into my house.

1649
01:53:20,334 --> 01:53:24,667
If that lot want to do charity work,
they should find somewhere else.

1650
01:53:26,417 --> 01:53:30,501
Nobody can come here yelling away
in the middle of the night.

1651
01:53:30,626 --> 01:53:32,376
I won't allow it.

1652
01:53:36,626 --> 01:53:39,876
And that bum of a teacher
doesn't give a damn.

1653
01:53:40,001 --> 01:53:42,501
The school needs this or that.

1654
01:53:43,667 --> 01:53:48,417
His real aim is to trap
bored neurotics like you.

1655
01:54:36,209 --> 01:54:38,334
Why don't you understand me, Nihal?

1656
01:54:41,876 --> 01:54:43,751
Why are you being unfair?

1657
01:54:45,709 --> 01:54:49,626
I swear my only intention
when I showed up

1658
01:54:50,626 --> 01:54:52,876
was to help you, support you.

1659
01:54:53,001 --> 01:54:56,376
Please leave me alone, Aydin.
I'm begging you.

1660
01:54:56,501 --> 01:55:00,209
Let's stay away from each other for a while.
You go or me.

1661
01:55:00,334 --> 01:55:02,417
Or let's break up, I don't know.

1662
01:55:04,251 --> 01:55:06,542
OK, why all the shouting?

1663
01:55:07,917 --> 01:55:09,584
I'm going anyway.

1664
01:55:10,667 --> 01:55:12,709
I made this decision some time ago.

1665
01:55:14,417 --> 01:55:16,251
I'm off to Istanbul for a while.

1666
01:55:17,792 --> 01:55:20,376
I have things to do for my book, too.

1667
01:55:21,126 --> 01:55:24,167
But I have doubts
about your donations campaign.

1668
01:55:25,209 --> 01:55:26,834
I find it very important.

1669
01:55:26,959 --> 01:55:28,667
I can't leave before sorting it out.

1670
01:55:29,626 --> 01:55:31,876
So please, let's just sit.

1671
01:55:32,584 --> 01:55:35,251
And talk calmly
like two civilised people, OK?

1672
01:55:35,792 --> 01:55:37,292
Come on, please.

1673
01:55:50,751 --> 01:55:53,917
Nihal, I'm asking you kindly.
Come and sit here.

1674
01:55:56,459 --> 01:55:58,001
Come on.

1675
01:56:06,084 --> 01:56:07,542
Nihal, will you come over here?

1676
01:56:51,626 --> 01:56:54,251
Nihal, darling...

1677
01:56:57,126 --> 01:57:00,376
It's obvious you started
such an organisation

1678
01:57:00,501 --> 01:57:03,126
because of your love of people

1679
01:57:03,751 --> 01:57:06,584
and your conscientiousness.

1680
01:57:06,709 --> 01:57:08,834
I'm not looking for a conspiracy.

1681
01:57:08,959 --> 01:57:11,626
In fact, I will support you all the way.

1682
01:57:13,584 --> 01:57:17,917
Although I respect your intelligence
and your feelings,

1683
01:57:18,042 --> 01:57:20,001
especially your feelings,

1684
01:57:21,292 --> 01:57:25,584
I can't allow such a tricky business
which could cause us

1685
01:57:25,709 --> 01:57:29,292
big problems we can't predict now

1686
01:57:29,417 --> 01:57:33,501
to be ruined at the hands of you
and those rascals.

1687
01:57:35,167 --> 01:57:37,167
However pure your intentions.

1688
01:57:38,001 --> 01:57:42,334
Remember "The road to hell
is paved with good intentions."

1689
01:57:44,751 --> 01:57:47,167
For a start, you've no experience.

1690
01:57:47,917 --> 01:57:49,584
You know nothing of life.

1691
01:57:49,709 --> 01:57:51,584
You're too impetuous.

1692
01:57:51,709 --> 01:57:53,626
You are easily deceived.

1693
01:57:54,251 --> 01:57:56,459
You trust people instantly.

1694
01:57:57,792 --> 01:58:01,167
You've gathered all these
strange assistants around you.

1695
01:58:02,209 --> 01:58:04,459
This is very dangerous business, Nihal.

1696
01:58:05,292 --> 01:58:08,417
To tell you the truth,

1697
01:58:09,084 --> 01:58:13,251
under these conditions,
any efforts will lead to two bad outcomes.

1698
01:58:13,876 --> 01:58:18,501
First, nothing gets done for the schools.

1699
01:58:18,626 --> 01:58:23,042
Second, you'll lose a fortune
because of all the shoddy work.

1700
01:58:23,167 --> 01:58:25,042
And your name will be stained.

1701
01:58:25,167 --> 01:58:27,876
One can say the money doesn't matter.
I can cover it.

1702
01:58:28,001 --> 01:58:30,792
But what about your name, our name?

1703
01:58:31,542 --> 01:58:33,917
Once things get out of hand,

1704
01:58:34,042 --> 01:58:37,209
you can't imagine all the gossip.

1705
01:58:37,334 --> 01:58:41,251
They'll all accuse us
of embezzling the donations.

1706
01:58:41,376 --> 01:58:43,459
And you'll suddenly be all alone.

1707
01:58:43,584 --> 01:58:45,084
They'll all vanish.

1708
01:58:45,209 --> 01:58:46,626
And we'll get blamed.

1709
01:58:46,751 --> 01:58:49,126
Just get to the point.

1710
01:58:49,917 --> 01:58:51,417
My point is this.

1711
01:58:51,542 --> 01:58:54,042
I was glad you were collecting donations.

1712
01:58:54,167 --> 01:58:56,417
But to be honest, I was worried too.

1713
01:58:57,126 --> 01:59:00,667
You need more than enthusiasm
in this kind of affair.

1714
01:59:01,709 --> 01:59:04,626
So I felt the urge to step in,

1715
01:59:04,751 --> 01:59:07,959
so we don't have problems
in the future.

1716
01:59:08,084 --> 01:59:10,709
- The urge?
- Yes.

1717
01:59:11,667 --> 01:59:16,251
Otherwise, I'd have gone to Istanbul.
But I can't until I sort this out.

1718
01:59:17,084 --> 01:59:20,334
This is a risky business, Nihal.
It's not a game.

1719
01:59:21,167 --> 01:59:24,667
There have been
all these fraud cases recently

1720
01:59:25,417 --> 01:59:27,959
and all the new laws.
Do you know them?

1721
01:59:28,084 --> 01:59:30,167
Get to the point.
What do you want?

1722
01:59:30,834 --> 01:59:34,334
I want to see
all the donations and expenditures.

1723
01:59:35,751 --> 01:59:39,917
And the list of your helpers.

1724
01:59:40,042 --> 01:59:44,626
I am sure they're trustworthy,
but better safe than sorry.

1725
01:59:44,751 --> 01:59:46,959
Are you serious?

1726
01:59:47,084 --> 01:59:51,126
Nihal, let's be reasonable, please.

1727
01:59:51,251 --> 01:59:54,584
Don't you trust my experience,
and my honesty?

1728
01:59:56,917 --> 01:59:59,417
I'm still not sure what you're after.

1729
01:59:59,542 --> 02:00:01,876
What could I be after?

1730
02:00:02,501 --> 02:00:04,542
What could I possibly be after?

1731
02:00:05,751 --> 02:00:09,001
I'm just trying to prevent
any problems for my family.

1732
02:00:09,126 --> 02:00:10,917
I have the right, don't I?

1733
02:00:15,209 --> 02:00:16,584
Now...

1734
02:00:19,376 --> 02:00:22,709
Let me see the donations
and your expenses.

1735
02:00:22,834 --> 02:00:26,167
It'll take me a minute
to spot any problems.

1736
02:00:26,792 --> 02:00:29,459
I just want to see your situation.

1737
02:00:29,584 --> 02:00:32,709
I have nothing to hide.
Anyone can look.

1738
02:00:32,834 --> 02:00:34,584
There they are, take a look.

1739
02:00:39,167 --> 02:00:40,792
These?

1740
02:00:59,917 --> 02:01:03,209
I'm sorry, but I don't understand
any of this.

1741
02:01:04,084 --> 02:01:06,917
Don't you have a table showing donations?

1742
02:01:07,042 --> 02:01:09,542
We have the signed documents.

1743
02:01:13,167 --> 02:01:15,917
Nihal, dearest...

1744
02:01:16,792 --> 02:01:19,501
It's obvious you haven't a clue.

1745
02:01:19,626 --> 02:01:22,167
How is that possible?

1746
02:01:23,292 --> 02:01:27,792
How come you don't have a chart
showing everything at once?

1747
02:01:32,209 --> 02:01:36,251
You should also have a copy
of the receipts for donations.

1748
02:01:36,376 --> 02:01:37,709
Do you have them?

1749
02:01:38,376 --> 02:01:39,751
No.

1750
02:01:40,709 --> 02:01:45,376
For money or goods in kind,

1751
02:01:45,501 --> 02:01:48,917
you have to prepare
an invoice or receipt.

1752
02:01:49,042 --> 02:01:50,876
Have they been issued?

1753
02:01:51,001 --> 02:01:52,542
I don't think so.

1754
02:01:53,751 --> 02:01:55,376
But all this is very important.

1755
02:01:55,959 --> 02:01:57,459
Very important.

1756
02:01:58,626 --> 02:02:03,209
What if they want to deduct
the donation from taxes?

1757
02:02:05,376 --> 02:02:07,959
Or if they try to dodge taxes?

1758
02:02:08,084 --> 02:02:11,001
You'd get blamed and end up in jail.

1759
02:02:11,126 --> 02:02:16,667
Sorry, but these are
very important details.

1760
02:02:17,792 --> 02:02:21,876
Another thing. Receipts should be
numbered and listed separately.

1761
02:02:22,001 --> 02:02:23,584
Has that been done?

1762
02:02:24,042 --> 02:02:25,334
I don't think so.

1763
02:02:26,542 --> 02:02:29,751
Never mind. I'll start doing that,
to save you worrying.

1764
02:02:31,334 --> 02:02:32,834
Yes, do so.

1765
02:02:32,959 --> 02:02:34,292
Do as you wish.

1766
02:02:37,042 --> 02:02:38,417
All right.

1767
02:02:39,459 --> 02:02:41,751
Then let's do it like this.

1768
02:02:42,876 --> 02:02:48,209
Let me take this pile of books and papers
to my study.

1769
02:02:48,334 --> 02:02:52,209
I have some software,
I'll run them through.

1770
02:02:52,917 --> 02:02:56,834
I'll let you know my thoughts
once I've had a good look. OK?

1771
02:03:00,334 --> 02:03:02,209
Is this part of it, too?

1772
02:03:04,792 --> 02:03:06,417
All right.

1773
02:03:08,251 --> 02:03:11,584
Are you sure that's it?
If there's more, let me take it.

1774
02:03:12,542 --> 02:03:13,834
Take them.

1775
02:03:15,876 --> 02:03:18,251
Take them all.
Don't leave anything.

1776
02:03:18,376 --> 02:03:22,084
That was all I had left in life.
You can have them too.

1777
02:03:23,084 --> 02:03:24,876
Take everything I have.

1778
02:03:25,667 --> 02:03:28,834
Dear Nihal,
why are you talking like that?

1779
02:03:28,959 --> 02:03:30,001
Take them all.

1780
02:03:31,792 --> 02:03:34,209
Take them, they can all be yours.

1781
02:03:34,334 --> 02:03:36,292
Take these too.

1782
02:03:39,001 --> 02:03:40,042
Here.

1783
02:03:40,167 --> 02:03:42,417
- Take them.
- What are you doing?

1784
02:04:05,751 --> 02:04:08,459
Oh, my dear Nihal.

1785
02:04:10,876 --> 02:04:13,459
You're acting like a child.

1786
02:04:14,126 --> 02:04:15,584
What can I say?

1787
02:04:16,542 --> 02:04:19,376
When you understand how important this is,

1788
02:04:19,501 --> 02:04:21,834
you'll come and thank me.

1789
02:04:23,334 --> 02:04:24,959
Wait and see.

1790
02:05:17,001 --> 02:05:18,834
Nihal, listen.

1791
02:05:19,709 --> 02:05:22,334
Here are all your documents back.

1792
02:05:23,376 --> 02:05:25,334
I didn't look at them much.

1793
02:05:26,334 --> 02:05:28,376
Because I've changed my mind.

1794
02:05:29,376 --> 02:05:32,626
I'm not going to get involved,
stick my nose in.

1795
02:05:35,751 --> 02:05:38,667
To tell the truth,
I felt a little bit lazy.

1796
02:05:38,792 --> 02:05:42,792
I have enough work already.
So, you do whatever suits you.

1797
02:05:46,292 --> 02:05:50,292
In the meantime, I'm leaving tomorrow.
I've decided to go.

1798
02:05:51,417 --> 02:05:53,917
At least till the end of winter.

1799
02:05:54,042 --> 02:05:57,501
The hotel's never too busy in winter.
Hidayet is here.

1800
02:05:58,751 --> 02:06:00,584
Tomorrow I'm going to Istanbul.

1801
02:06:08,251 --> 02:06:10,001
Nihal, cut it out, for God's sake!

1802
02:06:11,001 --> 02:06:13,209
I said I'm leaving,
what more do you want?

1803
02:06:15,792 --> 02:06:18,584
Your altruism brings tears to my eyes.

1804
02:06:43,751 --> 02:06:45,959
Do you remember?

1805
02:06:47,084 --> 02:06:49,334
You once told me

1806
02:06:49,459 --> 02:06:52,917
that if I could change
some of my behaviour,

1807
02:06:54,459 --> 02:06:56,667
you would forgive me completely.

1808
02:06:56,792 --> 02:06:58,084
Remember?

1809
02:07:00,084 --> 02:07:01,917
Which means...

1810
02:07:03,584 --> 02:07:05,584
for you I'm guilty of something.

1811
02:07:09,792 --> 02:07:11,376
Therefore,

1812
02:07:13,167 --> 02:07:17,042
calmly and briefly,

1813
02:07:17,834 --> 02:07:20,626
in terms I can understand,

1814
02:07:20,751 --> 02:07:22,792
I ask you to tell me

1815
02:07:22,917 --> 02:07:24,542
what I'm guilty of.

1816
02:07:33,876 --> 02:07:36,292
I'm too tired, I can't talk now.

1817
02:07:36,959 --> 02:07:38,459
Later maybe.

1818
02:07:41,667 --> 02:07:43,667
What kind of guilt is that?

1819
02:07:45,917 --> 02:07:47,417
What have I done to you?

1820
02:07:49,667 --> 02:07:53,001
Is that you're young, beautiful
and would like to live your life?

1821
02:07:53,751 --> 02:07:57,417
I'm much older than you
and you hate me for that?

1822
02:07:58,584 --> 02:07:59,584
Is that my guilt?

1823
02:08:02,459 --> 02:08:05,334
I didn't force you to marry me.

1824
02:08:07,126 --> 02:08:09,251
I never restricted your freedom.

1825
02:08:10,501 --> 02:08:14,376
You live as you wish, independently,
in your part of the house.

1826
02:08:15,876 --> 02:08:19,292
You have even set up
a huge committee here.

1827
02:08:21,917 --> 02:08:24,584
If you want even more freedom, it's yours.

1828
02:08:24,709 --> 02:08:26,376
No one's stopping you.

1829
02:08:27,167 --> 02:08:28,251
I mean it.

1830
02:08:29,834 --> 02:08:32,917
If you want a divorce,
I won't stop you either.

1831
02:08:46,542 --> 02:08:48,459
I don't want anything like that.

1832
02:08:50,459 --> 02:08:52,876
Of course, I wanted to marry you.

1833
02:08:55,334 --> 02:08:58,292
It's not that I'm young,
and you're old,

1834
02:08:58,417 --> 02:09:01,542
or I could love someone else
if I was free.

1835
02:09:04,084 --> 02:09:07,459
I always felt I'm older than you anyway.

1836
02:09:10,876 --> 02:09:13,167
But you're an unbearable man.

1837
02:09:14,417 --> 02:09:17,417
You are selfish, spiteful, cynical.

1838
02:09:19,042 --> 02:09:20,542
That's what you're guilty of.

1839
02:09:24,792 --> 02:09:28,084
Possible.
Maybe I'm like that, I don't know.

1840
02:09:29,251 --> 02:09:33,751
At least I can admit my mistakes
from time to time.

1841
02:09:35,251 --> 02:09:38,792
But I've never once seen you
take the blame for anything.

1842
02:09:38,917 --> 02:09:39,917
Am I wrong?

1843
02:09:40,042 --> 02:09:42,959
If you intend to nag all night,
I should let you know,

1844
02:09:43,084 --> 02:09:46,042
I don't have the strength
to answer back anymore.

1845
02:09:46,167 --> 02:09:48,376
I don't want to nag at all.

1846
02:09:49,084 --> 02:09:51,251
But I have to ask again.

1847
02:09:51,376 --> 02:09:53,584
I need to know.

1848
02:09:54,709 --> 02:09:56,501
What am I guilty of?

1849
02:09:58,834 --> 02:10:00,667
What kind of guilt is it?

1850
02:10:01,459 --> 02:10:03,209
What have I done to you?

1851
02:10:05,626 --> 02:10:06,959
True.

1852
02:10:09,459 --> 02:10:11,834
You're actually a well-educated,

1853
02:10:12,584 --> 02:10:14,084
honest,

1854
02:10:14,209 --> 02:10:16,667
fair and conscientious man.

1855
02:10:17,667 --> 02:10:21,459
Generally you are like that.
I won't deny it.

1856
02:10:23,626 --> 02:10:26,834
But you sometimes use these virtues
to suffocate people,

1857
02:10:26,959 --> 02:10:30,001
to crush and humiliate them.

1858
02:10:32,084 --> 02:10:35,667
Your high principles make you hate
the whole world.

1859
02:10:37,251 --> 02:10:39,251
You hate believers,

1860
02:10:39,376 --> 02:10:43,834
because for you, believing is a sign
of underdevelopment and ignorance.

1861
02:10:44,751 --> 02:10:49,626
But you also hate non-believers
for their lack of faith or ideals.

1862
02:10:51,709 --> 02:10:53,501
You dislike the old

1863
02:10:54,042 --> 02:10:57,501
for being conservative bigots
and not thinking freely.

1864
02:10:58,626 --> 02:11:01,292
And you dislike the young
for thinking freely

1865
02:11:02,084 --> 02:11:04,667
and abandoning the traditions.

1866
02:11:06,292 --> 02:11:10,042
You defend the virtues of community.

1867
02:11:11,667 --> 02:11:16,584
But you suspect everyone
of being a thief or a bandit,

1868
02:11:16,709 --> 02:11:18,542
so you hate the people, too.

1869
02:11:20,167 --> 02:11:22,292
You hate practically everybody.

1870
02:11:24,376 --> 02:11:25,709
Just once,

1871
02:11:26,917 --> 02:11:30,709
I'd like you to defend something
that might cost you

1872
02:11:30,834 --> 02:11:35,251
and have feelings
that don't benefit yourself.

1873
02:11:38,709 --> 02:11:40,376
But that's not possible.

1874
02:11:49,792 --> 02:11:53,209
In the past, you stopped us splitting up,
using various methods.

1875
02:11:56,584 --> 02:11:58,792
Well, maybe it worked both ways.

1876
02:12:00,292 --> 02:12:02,167
I was too young to leave.

1877
02:12:04,167 --> 02:12:06,417
I didn't have the courage or the money.

1878
02:12:07,417 --> 02:12:09,667
Or anywhere better to go.

1879
02:12:12,667 --> 02:12:15,626
But didn't you feel any remorse

1880
02:12:15,751 --> 02:12:18,792
seeing a young, healthy, proud,
lively woman

1881
02:12:19,834 --> 02:12:21,792
wither away

1882
02:12:21,917 --> 02:12:26,501
in emptiness, boredom and fear?

1883
02:12:28,542 --> 02:12:31,167
I felt fear in our first years.

1884
02:12:32,459 --> 02:12:34,626
Now I feel ashamed.

1885
02:12:39,167 --> 02:12:41,417
My best years have been wasted.

1886
02:12:42,209 --> 02:12:45,876
I shed all my good qualities
to struggle with you.

1887
02:12:48,042 --> 02:12:52,042
I've become tough, coarse,
timid and suspicious.

1888
02:12:56,626 --> 02:12:58,501
What else can I say?

1889
02:13:01,459 --> 02:13:04,667
I'm not even sure
I could express anything.

1890
02:13:10,876 --> 02:13:13,792
But our paths have now parted
even if it's under one roof.

1891
02:13:15,126 --> 02:13:17,001
We should each go our own way.

1892
02:13:26,001 --> 02:13:29,126
We could've had a better life.

1893
02:13:32,084 --> 02:13:33,792
But it's too late now.

1894
02:13:38,209 --> 02:13:40,292
You wouldn't know, but...

1895
02:13:40,417 --> 02:13:44,792
people like me who grew up
in villages with not even electricity,

1896
02:13:46,542 --> 02:13:49,334
understand the joy and pleasure

1897
02:13:50,001 --> 02:13:53,376
of being in a small, warm,
cosy room like this,

1898
02:13:53,501 --> 02:13:55,167
listening to my wife's voice,

1899
02:13:55,292 --> 02:13:59,834
even if she is screaming in my face
how bad I am.

1900
02:14:05,417 --> 02:14:07,751
Our youth was very dull, Nihal.

1901
02:14:09,667 --> 02:14:12,126
We didn't know how to be happy.

1902
02:14:13,126 --> 02:14:15,542
So we may not know
how to make others happy.

1903
02:14:18,334 --> 02:14:20,001
But as I said,

1904
02:14:20,584 --> 02:14:22,501
we had no bad intentions.

1905
02:14:24,167 --> 02:14:28,376
We set out with good intentions,
pure, innocent dreams.

1906
02:14:30,417 --> 02:14:32,459
We wanted a better life and society.

1907
02:14:32,584 --> 02:14:35,042
Sorry, but I don't believe you.

1908
02:14:35,167 --> 02:14:37,792
I've heard it all before.
You're not on stage anymore.

1909
02:14:39,292 --> 02:14:41,917
We all start with good intentions.

1910
02:14:42,042 --> 02:14:46,876
But as you said, the road to hell
is paved with good intentions.

1911
02:14:47,001 --> 02:14:49,334
So all this means nothing.

1912
02:14:49,459 --> 02:14:52,292
All these fine words
sound ridiculous to me now.

1913
02:14:53,667 --> 02:14:56,167
When you start talking like this,

1914
02:14:56,292 --> 02:15:01,292
I feel like you're pulling
trick number two to get your way.

1915
02:15:03,084 --> 02:15:07,001
Yet I've never understood
what you really want from me.

1916
02:15:07,792 --> 02:15:09,376
Even so,

1917
02:15:09,501 --> 02:15:11,959
I'll ask you one more time.

1918
02:15:13,709 --> 02:15:15,709
Whatever you call my activity,

1919
02:15:15,834 --> 02:15:19,084
self-deception or feminine logic,

1920
02:15:20,001 --> 02:15:21,834
leave me alone.

1921
02:15:23,042 --> 02:15:25,876
Because this is my only consolation.

1922
02:15:30,376 --> 02:15:33,251
I spent my entire youth fighting with you.

1923
02:15:33,917 --> 02:15:38,709
Now, thanks to this work,
I believe in myself again.

1924
02:15:39,834 --> 02:15:43,084
I have found a meaning
to my dull life here.

1925
02:15:43,709 --> 02:15:46,334
A purpose that makes me feel proud.

1926
02:15:48,417 --> 02:15:50,417
So, at least allow me that.

1927
02:15:53,459 --> 02:15:54,876
Nihal, darling.

1928
02:15:56,292 --> 02:15:58,751
You're a good-hearted,

1929
02:15:58,876 --> 02:16:02,167
smart, rational, sensible woman.

1930
02:16:03,459 --> 02:16:06,709
Everything you say and do
is very reasonable.

1931
02:16:06,834 --> 02:16:08,376
It really is.

1932
02:16:10,501 --> 02:16:11,751
But...

1933
02:16:12,667 --> 02:16:16,334
not seeing a man for what he is,
idolising him like a god,

1934
02:16:16,459 --> 02:16:19,209
and then being mad at him,

1935
02:16:19,334 --> 02:16:21,626
because he's not a god.

1936
02:16:23,417 --> 02:16:25,209
Do you think that's fair?

1937
02:16:33,001 --> 02:16:38,126
I wish I were the successful,
charismatic actor you dreamed of.

1938
02:16:39,167 --> 02:16:40,667
But I am not.

1939
02:16:42,334 --> 02:16:44,042
I'm a simple man.

1940
02:16:46,376 --> 02:16:49,209
And what's worse,
I'd like to stay that way.

1941
02:16:53,126 --> 02:16:54,834
Anyway...

1942
02:16:54,959 --> 02:16:56,834
I'm leaving in the morning.

1943
02:16:57,501 --> 02:17:00,167
Don't worry, I won't be back
before spring.

1944
02:17:02,167 --> 02:17:03,626
But give me that list,

1945
02:17:05,334 --> 02:17:08,167
so I can make a small donation.

1946
02:17:08,751 --> 02:17:12,084
Do as you please. I don't care.

1947
02:17:12,917 --> 02:17:15,626
The list is there,
write what you want.

1948
02:17:53,042 --> 02:17:55,751
I signed it an anonymous donor.

1949
02:18:00,751 --> 02:18:02,417
And left the money here.

1950
02:18:03,376 --> 02:18:04,626
All right?

1951
02:18:10,209 --> 02:18:12,626
I hope things turn out
as you'd like.

1952
02:18:14,626 --> 02:18:16,667
Do as you want.

1953
02:18:18,459 --> 02:18:21,626
And don't forget I'm there
if you need any help.

1954
02:18:25,417 --> 02:18:28,167
But beware of that teacher.

1955
02:18:28,959 --> 02:18:32,167
He looked like the sneaky,
scheming type to me.

1956
02:18:32,292 --> 02:18:34,667
I can smell his kind a mile away.

1957
02:18:36,042 --> 02:18:38,917
I suggest you work with people

1958
02:18:39,042 --> 02:18:42,667
who are conscientious, principled
and have moral sense.

1959
02:18:44,042 --> 02:18:46,501
One day, you'll understand better.

1960
02:18:50,167 --> 02:18:51,959
Conscience. Morals.

1961
02:18:52,959 --> 02:18:55,167
Ideals, principles.

1962
02:18:55,292 --> 02:18:57,167
The purpose of life.

1963
02:18:57,792 --> 02:19:00,209
You're always saying these words.

1964
02:19:01,876 --> 02:19:05,167
The words you always use to humiliate, hurt,

1965
02:19:05,292 --> 02:19:07,542
or denigrate someone.

1966
02:19:09,542 --> 02:19:11,292
But if you ask me...

1967
02:19:11,417 --> 02:19:15,042
if someone uses these words this much,

1968
02:19:16,126 --> 02:19:17,834
he's the one to suspect.

1969
02:19:36,834 --> 02:19:38,501
Anyway, I'm tired.

1970
02:19:39,876 --> 02:19:42,417
I'd like to sleep,
if you don't mind.

1971
02:19:59,042 --> 02:20:00,292
Necla?

1972
02:21:48,209 --> 02:21:49,459
Go on.

1973
02:23:00,042 --> 02:23:02,667
Should we check again before we set off?

1974
02:23:04,001 --> 02:23:05,167
I called already.

1975
02:23:05,292 --> 02:23:07,834
No flights, but the trains are running.

1976
02:23:08,709 --> 02:23:09,959
Are you sure?

1977
02:23:10,084 --> 02:23:12,042
I just called them.

1978
02:23:12,167 --> 02:23:14,292
The train is running.

1979
02:23:14,417 --> 02:23:16,084
Don't worry.

1980
02:23:18,126 --> 02:23:19,376
Fine.

1981
02:23:20,501 --> 02:23:22,167
Let's get going then.

1982
02:24:24,167 --> 02:24:25,709
Hello.

1983
02:24:28,042 --> 02:24:32,042
The Istanbul train is running,
isn't it?

1984
02:24:32,167 --> 02:24:34,126
No problem. It's on its way.

1985
02:24:34,251 --> 02:24:35,792
Any delay?

1986
02:24:35,917 --> 02:24:38,001
Of course, half an hour or an hour.

1987
02:24:38,126 --> 02:24:40,667
- Half an hour, an hour.
- That's it.

1988
02:24:40,792 --> 02:24:43,959
- But it's definitely coming, right?
- Probably.

1989
02:24:44,084 --> 02:24:46,001
OK, thank you.

1990
02:25:00,709 --> 02:25:04,417
- It's coming, but there's a delay...
- I heard him.

1991
02:25:07,667 --> 02:25:09,334
Your luggage is there.

1992
02:25:11,501 --> 02:25:14,251
I'll go back to the hotel
if you like.

1993
02:25:14,376 --> 02:25:16,584
They might need me there now.

1994
02:25:17,417 --> 02:25:19,501
- Should I go or stay?
- What?

1995
02:25:19,626 --> 02:25:22,251
They might need me at the hotel.

1996
02:25:22,376 --> 02:25:24,501
Should I go or wait here?

1997
02:25:25,876 --> 02:25:27,167
Wait.

1998
02:25:47,876 --> 02:25:50,417
My friend, could you move over a bit?

1999
02:25:52,251 --> 02:25:53,751
It's cold by the door.

2000
02:25:53,876 --> 02:25:56,751
We're together.
You know, if you shift a bit.

2001
02:25:56,876 --> 02:25:59,126
There's a draft, I said. Sit here.

2002
02:27:14,126 --> 02:27:16,251
How's the road to Suavi's?

2003
02:27:16,792 --> 02:27:18,751
- Mr Suavi's farm?
- Yes.

2004
02:27:18,876 --> 02:27:20,917
It's a long way.

2005
02:27:21,042 --> 02:27:22,501
That's not my question.

2006
02:27:22,626 --> 02:27:24,167
Can the car make it?

2007
02:27:24,292 --> 02:27:26,417
No, it wouldn't.

2008
02:27:26,542 --> 02:27:29,751
The village road's impossible
in this snow.

2009
02:27:30,459 --> 02:27:32,709
Good, then we're going there.

2010
02:27:52,001 --> 02:27:54,334
<i>Hey, what a surprise!</i>

2011
02:27:54,459 --> 02:27:57,751
<i>We were passing
and decided to return your visit.</i>

2012
02:27:57,876 --> 02:28:00,834
<i>Of course. Come in.
It's warm inside.</i>

2013
02:28:02,751 --> 02:28:04,334
Come in.

2014
02:28:04,459 --> 02:28:06,042
- Thanks.
- This way.

2015
02:28:06,167 --> 02:28:08,542
- Sit down, get warmed up.
- Thanks.

2016
02:28:08,667 --> 02:28:10,542
I was expecting Levent.

2017
02:28:10,667 --> 02:28:12,542
So I thought it was him.

2018
02:28:12,667 --> 02:28:17,459
But with Levent,
you never know whether he'll come.

2019
02:28:18,584 --> 02:28:21,126
We meet every Saturday afternoon.

2020
02:28:21,251 --> 02:28:23,126
To go hunting the morning after.

2021
02:28:24,459 --> 02:28:27,292
You know. Two bachelors.

2022
02:28:27,417 --> 02:28:29,876
We lean on each other
like walking sticks.

2023
02:28:30,001 --> 02:28:32,459
Suavi, can I stretch my leg out?

2024
02:28:32,584 --> 02:28:34,751
- Go ahead.
- I got cramp.

2025
02:28:34,876 --> 02:28:37,042
Put it up higher. That's it.

2026
02:28:37,917 --> 02:28:39,584
How nice.

2027
02:28:40,209 --> 02:28:41,917
Nice and warm.

2028
02:28:42,042 --> 02:28:43,584
Comfy couches.

2029
02:28:43,709 --> 02:28:45,417
You must be cold.

2030
02:28:45,542 --> 02:28:47,751
Wait, I've got just the thing.

2031
02:28:47,876 --> 02:28:51,459
One sip of this,
and the cold will disappear.

2032
02:28:52,126 --> 02:28:54,459
Let's see if you like it.

2033
02:28:56,292 --> 02:28:59,042
We take this with us
when we go hunting.

2034
02:28:59,167 --> 02:29:01,126
We put some in our flasks.

2035
02:29:03,001 --> 02:29:05,667
It's freezing cold out there.

2036
02:29:06,209 --> 02:29:07,876
The teacher is young.

2037
02:29:08,459 --> 02:29:09,834
Sturdy as an ox.

2038
02:29:09,959 --> 02:29:12,709
But I need this in my engine to keep up.

2039
02:29:12,834 --> 02:29:15,751
I better not. I'm not used to it.

2040
02:29:15,876 --> 02:29:17,626
If you've some herb tea...

2041
02:29:17,751 --> 02:29:21,751
You can drink that at home.
Here, you do what I tell you.

2042
02:29:21,876 --> 02:29:24,459
Well, fine then. Thanks.

2043
02:29:25,709 --> 02:29:29,376
This is how I spoil myself.
What else is there?

2044
02:29:29,501 --> 02:29:32,167
We deserve it at our age.

2045
02:29:33,376 --> 02:29:35,084
I feel warmer now.

2046
02:29:37,417 --> 02:29:38,667
Thank you.

2047
02:29:38,792 --> 02:29:40,501
The stove is burning nicely.

2048
02:29:41,501 --> 02:29:43,959
I don't heat the whole house now.

2049
02:29:44,084 --> 02:29:46,709
After my wife died
I closed off the rooms.

2050
02:29:46,834 --> 02:29:48,334
I use them as storage.

2051
02:29:48,459 --> 02:29:50,292
And I set up this stove here.

2052
02:29:50,417 --> 02:29:53,334
It's like a shelter.
I curl up here.

2053
02:29:53,459 --> 02:29:55,334
And it helps me save a bit.

2054
02:29:57,126 --> 02:29:59,876
By the way,
what did you do about the letter?

2055
02:30:00,001 --> 02:30:01,292
What letter?

2056
02:30:01,417 --> 02:30:04,167
The one you read to Nihal and me.

2057
02:30:04,292 --> 02:30:06,959
Garip, the girl, help, and all that.

2058
02:30:08,126 --> 02:30:09,751
I didn't do anything.

2059
02:30:12,126 --> 02:30:15,459
- Teacher! You made it.
- Indeed.

2060
02:30:15,584 --> 02:30:17,501
Mr Aydin, nice to see you.

2061
02:30:17,626 --> 02:30:19,042
Thank you, Levent.

2062
02:30:19,167 --> 02:30:21,709
- Don't get up.
- My foot's gone numb.

2063
02:30:21,834 --> 02:30:24,751
If it's only numbness,
you'll be fine.

2064
02:30:24,876 --> 02:30:25,876
Hello.

2065
02:30:26,417 --> 02:30:28,876
We had business nearby,
so we popped in.

2066
02:30:29,001 --> 02:30:30,001
Good idea!

2067
02:30:30,126 --> 02:30:31,501
How bad are the roads?

2068
02:30:31,626 --> 02:30:34,626
Terrible. I had a hard time getting here.

2069
02:30:34,751 --> 02:30:37,209
Mr Aydin, I'll be outside
if you need me.

2070
02:30:37,334 --> 02:30:38,542
All right.

2071
02:30:39,876 --> 02:30:41,876
- Hidayet.
- Yes, Mr Aydin.

2072
02:30:42,001 --> 02:30:43,292
Listen.

2073
02:30:44,751 --> 02:30:46,167
Sorry.

2074
02:30:49,167 --> 02:30:50,626
Listen.

2075
02:30:50,751 --> 02:30:54,084
Don't tell anyone at home I'm here.

2076
02:30:54,209 --> 02:30:56,167
Of course I won't.

2077
02:30:56,792 --> 02:30:58,626
So what should I tell them?

2078
02:30:58,751 --> 02:31:00,251
Nothing.

2079
02:31:00,376 --> 02:31:03,251
No, I mean if they call.

2080
02:31:04,459 --> 02:31:09,001
Make something up.
Nobody should know I didn't leave.

2081
02:31:09,126 --> 02:31:11,334
- All right.
- Be careful.

2082
02:31:15,542 --> 02:31:19,001
At your house, I thought,
"Finally someone worth talking to."

2083
02:31:19,126 --> 02:31:21,334
But then you disappeared.

2084
02:31:21,459 --> 02:31:24,876
Thank you. Something came up.

2085
02:31:25,834 --> 02:31:27,209
I couldn't stay.

2086
02:31:27,334 --> 02:31:28,917
Today's my lucky day.

2087
02:31:29,042 --> 02:31:31,042
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

2088
02:31:31,167 --> 02:31:33,626
Drink up,
it makes you think clearly.

2089
02:31:43,501 --> 02:31:46,251
Hi. What are you up to?

2090
02:31:50,542 --> 02:31:52,292
Now listen.

2091
02:31:53,251 --> 02:31:56,334
Don't say anything
to Mrs Nihal or anyone.

2092
02:31:56,459 --> 02:31:58,792
You know Suavi.

2093
02:31:58,917 --> 02:32:00,876
We're at his farm.

2094
02:32:03,376 --> 02:32:04,792
He didn't go.

2095
02:32:05,876 --> 02:32:07,584
He changed his mind.

2096
02:32:09,584 --> 02:32:12,417
How should I know?
How can I ask him?

2097
02:32:14,584 --> 02:32:17,626
Stop talking nonsense.
Why would I lie to you?

2098
02:32:18,459 --> 02:32:19,792
What did you say?

2099
02:32:20,542 --> 02:32:22,376
Fatma, don't start again.

2100
02:32:22,501 --> 02:32:25,667
It's freezing. What on earth
could I be doing? Are you mad?

2101
02:32:25,792 --> 02:32:27,417
For God's sake.

2102
02:32:27,542 --> 02:32:28,792
<i>When I was a kid,</i>

2103
02:32:29,542 --> 02:32:32,334
I used to play in the garden here.

2104
02:32:33,459 --> 02:32:38,501
It felt life would go on like that forever,
with my mum and dad.

2105
02:32:39,876 --> 02:32:41,959
Where is all that now?

2106
02:32:42,792 --> 02:32:47,876
Sometimes I wonder what happened.
When did the house become so empty?

2107
02:32:49,001 --> 02:32:54,001
When did that mother's little boy end up

2108
02:32:54,126 --> 02:32:57,709
a drunk, lonely old man?

2109
02:32:59,751 --> 02:33:01,376
I got married.

2110
02:33:01,501 --> 02:33:03,126
Had a child.

2111
02:33:04,417 --> 02:33:06,084
Where are they?

2112
02:33:07,126 --> 02:33:10,251
Wife in the grave,
daughter miles away...

2113
02:33:12,751 --> 02:33:14,917
What I'm saying is,

2114
02:33:15,042 --> 02:33:18,501
since there are certain things
you can't change,

2115
02:33:19,542 --> 02:33:22,584
you have to be a bit flexible.

2116
02:33:23,334 --> 02:33:25,167
Don't judge people so much.

2117
02:33:26,459 --> 02:33:28,542
Accept things as they are.

2118
02:33:32,376 --> 02:33:34,167
Is it a bit hot in here?

2119
02:33:35,126 --> 02:33:37,167
Should we open a window?

2120
02:33:38,167 --> 02:33:40,042
Of course, go ahead.

2121
02:33:42,917 --> 02:33:45,001
Should we move to that side too?

2122
02:33:45,126 --> 02:33:46,292
All right.

2123
02:33:46,417 --> 02:33:49,376
- You go, I'll get something.
- OK.

2124
02:33:58,542 --> 02:34:01,001
It's hot and I had a drink.

2125
02:34:01,126 --> 02:34:02,917
I'm feeling a bit drowsy.

2126
02:34:03,042 --> 02:34:05,001
It would've been better not to.

2127
02:34:05,792 --> 02:34:07,459
But it's too late now.

2128
02:34:21,959 --> 02:34:24,209
So, Levent, how old are you?

2129
02:34:25,417 --> 02:34:26,459
35.

2130
02:34:26,584 --> 02:34:29,001
- Really? You don't look it.
- Well, I am.

2131
02:34:30,251 --> 02:34:31,501
Family?

2132
02:34:32,376 --> 02:34:34,667
Back in my hometown, in Yozgat.

2133
02:34:35,251 --> 02:34:36,917
My older sister and mother.

2134
02:34:37,834 --> 02:34:39,876
Ever thought of getting married?

2135
02:34:40,001 --> 02:34:41,042
Well...

2136
02:34:41,167 --> 02:34:43,626
It's fate. Didn't happen.

2137
02:34:43,751 --> 02:34:45,584
I haven't met the right one.

2138
02:34:46,459 --> 02:34:50,792
And I don't have enough money.
So I'm in no rush.

2139
02:34:50,917 --> 02:34:54,584
But in a place like this,
your salary would do.

2140
02:34:55,126 --> 02:34:57,459
It would, Mr Aydin.

2141
02:34:57,584 --> 02:35:00,792
But I send half to my mother.

2142
02:35:00,917 --> 02:35:03,126
She's saving up for my sister.

2143
02:35:03,251 --> 02:35:06,251
Let her get married.
She's first in line.

2144
02:35:06,376 --> 02:35:08,459
Then me. I'm in no rush.

2145
02:35:09,959 --> 02:35:11,834
How long have you been here?

2146
02:35:12,876 --> 02:35:15,209
This is my fourth year.

2147
02:35:16,251 --> 02:35:17,376
Planning to stay?

2148
02:35:19,917 --> 02:35:23,084
I could leave,
but you get used to a place.

2149
02:35:24,126 --> 02:35:27,459
And there are the things
we do with Mrs Nihal.

2150
02:35:27,584 --> 02:35:29,251
I want to finish them.

2151
02:35:29,376 --> 02:35:31,459
That's no problem.

2152
02:35:33,167 --> 02:35:36,667
There are always people
for that kind of thing.

2153
02:35:38,376 --> 02:35:40,542
You're right. There are.

2154
02:35:43,042 --> 02:35:46,167
I had a stammer when I was a child.

2155
02:35:46,292 --> 02:35:48,042
- Really?
- Yes.

2156
02:35:48,959 --> 02:35:51,917
I spent my entire childhood in silence.

2157
02:35:52,042 --> 02:35:55,334
If I talk too much now, that's why.

2158
02:35:58,209 --> 02:36:00,459
So, sorry if I talk too much.

2159
02:36:01,042 --> 02:36:04,417
- Warn me if I do.
- Speak as much as you like.

2160
02:36:04,542 --> 02:36:07,084
You deserve it, my friend.

2161
02:36:08,042 --> 02:36:11,417
I prefer listening anyway.

2162
02:36:11,876 --> 02:36:13,459
Well, I warned you.

2163
02:36:14,001 --> 02:36:15,251
Roast chestnuts.

2164
02:36:15,917 --> 02:36:17,959
A sin not to eat one.

2165
02:36:18,084 --> 02:36:20,376
The chestnut-man is here, gentlemen.

2166
02:36:21,001 --> 02:36:23,376
He's brought us split chestnuts.

2167
02:37:39,292 --> 02:37:40,584
Yes?

2168
02:37:41,667 --> 02:37:43,001
Hello.

2169
02:37:43,126 --> 02:37:45,167
Sorry to disturb you.

2170
02:37:45,292 --> 02:37:47,376
I'm here to see Hamdi hodja.

2171
02:37:47,501 --> 02:37:48,917
Is he in?

2172
02:37:50,001 --> 02:37:51,542
Just a minute.

2173
02:38:04,292 --> 02:38:05,751
Mrs Nihal?

2174
02:38:07,001 --> 02:38:09,334
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

2175
02:38:09,459 --> 02:38:12,751
I'm sorry. I was inside,
I couldn't... you know...

2176
02:38:12,876 --> 02:38:13,876
How can I help you?

2177
02:38:14,001 --> 02:38:17,959
I should apologise
for disturbing you so late.

2178
02:38:18,084 --> 02:38:21,126
No, not at all. Please.

2179
02:38:22,292 --> 02:38:24,251
Is this a convenient time?

2180
02:38:24,376 --> 02:38:26,334
Sure, of course. Come in.

2181
02:38:26,459 --> 02:38:27,834
Please, come in.

2182
02:38:27,959 --> 02:38:30,001
Don't stand in the cold.

2183
02:38:30,126 --> 02:38:31,542
Thank you.

2184
02:38:32,792 --> 02:38:34,667
Come and sit by the stove.

2185
02:38:34,792 --> 02:38:36,417
Don't worry, I'm fine here.

2186
02:38:36,542 --> 02:38:39,209
It's cold there.
Come in with your shoes.

2187
02:38:39,334 --> 02:38:41,917
Thanks, I won't stay long.
I'll sit here.

2188
02:38:42,876 --> 02:38:44,501
Well then...

2189
02:38:57,709 --> 02:38:59,876
How are you?
Hope nothing's wrong.

2190
02:39:00,334 --> 02:39:04,209
Don't get me wrong.
To see you here, alone...

2191
02:39:04,334 --> 02:39:08,584
I was wondering how Ilyas was.
He worried us a lot the other day.

2192
02:39:08,709 --> 02:39:11,834
Actually we heard,
but I still wanted to come for a visit.

2193
02:39:12,334 --> 02:39:14,792
Ilyas is much better now.

2194
02:39:14,917 --> 02:39:18,459
Thank God, he's fine now.
His fever dropped, too.

2195
02:39:18,584 --> 02:39:22,709
That worried us but since yesterday,
he's opened his eyes.

2196
02:39:23,459 --> 02:39:27,501
The only thing, he couldn't go to school
and he gets bored at home.

2197
02:39:27,626 --> 02:39:29,417
Otherwise, he's fine.

2198
02:39:29,542 --> 02:39:31,209
It's not easy.

2199
02:39:32,126 --> 02:39:35,584
I was worried when I heard
it was pneumonia.

2200
02:39:36,292 --> 02:39:38,417
But his mother has taken
good care of him.

2201
02:39:38,542 --> 02:39:43,542
And he took his medicine
and got better. Good boy.

2202
02:39:44,126 --> 02:39:46,126
You're right.

2203
02:39:46,251 --> 02:39:47,834
Thank you.

2204
02:39:50,501 --> 02:39:52,042
Mr Aydin isn't with you?

2205
02:39:53,751 --> 02:39:55,126
No, I came alone.

2206
02:39:56,251 --> 02:39:58,667
Really? Welcome, again.

2207
02:40:00,751 --> 02:40:03,251
You must be cold,
it's freezing outside.

2208
02:40:03,376 --> 02:40:05,917
Let's have some tea. Sevda!

2209
02:40:06,042 --> 02:40:08,042
I'll go to the kitchen.

2210
02:40:08,167 --> 02:40:11,001
- Don't bother.
- No, my pleasure.

2211
02:40:26,751 --> 02:40:28,001
Are you studying?

2212
02:40:34,292 --> 02:40:35,626
Yes.

2213
02:40:39,001 --> 02:40:41,626
- Which subject?
- Maths.

2214
02:40:42,876 --> 02:40:44,167
Do you like maths?

2215
02:40:44,292 --> 02:40:45,376
Yes.

2216
02:40:45,501 --> 02:40:47,792
What will you become then?
An engineer?

2217
02:40:48,501 --> 02:40:49,917
No.

2218
02:40:51,251 --> 02:40:52,834
What then?

2219
02:40:52,959 --> 02:40:54,126
A policeman.

2220
02:40:55,001 --> 02:40:56,584
Why's that?

2221
02:41:08,167 --> 02:41:09,584
Good evening, madam.

2222
02:41:09,709 --> 02:41:12,042
Good evening. And who are you?

2223
02:41:13,751 --> 02:41:16,792
Mother, Mrs Nihal is our landlord's wife.

2224
02:41:19,292 --> 02:41:20,834
Did she bring the TV back?

2225
02:41:20,959 --> 02:41:24,376
No, mother.
That's a different matter.

2226
02:41:24,501 --> 02:41:25,626
Come, mother.

2227
02:41:26,376 --> 02:41:28,834
I want my TV back.
I watched the Imam.

2228
02:41:28,959 --> 02:41:31,542
Mrs Nihal is here for something else.

2229
02:41:31,667 --> 02:41:33,626
To wish Ilyas a speedy recovery.

2230
02:41:33,751 --> 02:41:34,959
- Sore knees?
- Aching.

2231
02:41:35,584 --> 02:41:38,042
- Let's cover them.
- No, I don't want to.

2232
02:41:38,167 --> 02:41:41,751
- All right.
- You don't take me to the doctor.

2233
02:41:42,334 --> 02:41:45,709
Mother, you're disgracing us
in front of Mrs Nihal.

2234
02:41:45,834 --> 02:41:48,251
- You refused to go, remember?
- Too crowded.

2235
02:41:48,376 --> 02:41:51,751
They can't look after me there.
I need a private doctor.

2236
02:41:51,876 --> 02:41:53,251
But please...

2237
02:41:54,042 --> 02:41:56,501
I said to go to a private doctor too.

2238
02:41:56,626 --> 02:41:58,876
You refused to go to our Samet.

2239
02:41:59,001 --> 02:42:01,376
You remember what his mother did to me?

2240
02:42:01,876 --> 02:42:04,542
But the son isn't the mother.

2241
02:42:04,667 --> 02:42:05,959
The doctor has to come.

2242
02:42:06,084 --> 02:42:08,709
OK then, I'll bring the doctor right here.

2243
02:42:08,834 --> 02:42:11,084
He'll take care of my mother here.

2244
02:42:11,209 --> 02:42:12,876
Sevda, give me my prayer beads.

2245
02:42:13,001 --> 02:42:14,626
I apologise.

2246
02:42:15,334 --> 02:42:16,459
No problem.

2247
02:42:16,584 --> 02:42:19,542
When young, we're tested for our respect
and later, our compassion.

2248
02:42:20,126 --> 02:42:22,542
God bless our elders.

2249
02:42:22,667 --> 02:42:25,126
"If youngsters could know,
if elders could do."

2250
02:42:25,251 --> 02:42:28,626
I don't want to keep you longer.

2251
02:42:29,709 --> 02:42:31,542
I need to talk to you.

2252
02:42:32,626 --> 02:42:34,001
Of course, please.

2253
02:42:36,084 --> 02:42:40,792
If you don't mind,
could we speak in private?

2254
02:42:41,584 --> 02:42:44,626
Of course, why not?

2255
02:42:44,751 --> 02:42:48,876
We could go in there,
but it might be a bit cold.

2256
02:42:49,001 --> 02:42:51,251
Fine, it doesn't matter.

2257
02:42:51,376 --> 02:42:53,042
Let's go in. Sevda!

2258
02:42:53,167 --> 02:42:54,834
Put some wood on the stove.

2259
02:42:55,459 --> 02:42:57,292
I'll bring your tea through.

2260
02:42:58,542 --> 02:43:00,126
- Thank you.
- Please.

2261
02:43:05,001 --> 02:43:06,751
How many rooms are there?

2262
02:43:07,501 --> 02:43:09,417
There used to be two.

2263
02:43:09,542 --> 02:43:12,626
Then we added this one.

2264
02:43:12,751 --> 02:43:16,667
We got permission from Mr Aydin's father, Mr Sami.

2265
02:43:17,542 --> 02:43:19,334
So now, we have three rooms.

2266
02:43:19,459 --> 02:43:21,667
This is my room.

2267
02:43:21,792 --> 02:43:24,542
It gets a bit colder
than the other rooms.

2268
02:43:24,667 --> 02:43:28,626
But we built a fireplace
for when it gets very cold.

2269
02:43:29,251 --> 02:43:31,334
Fortunately, not this year.

2270
02:43:31,459 --> 02:43:32,709
That's right.

2271
02:43:34,042 --> 02:43:37,667
Mr Hamdi, I'd like to ask you something, please.

2272
02:43:37,792 --> 02:43:39,209
Please do.

2273
02:43:41,167 --> 02:43:43,167
Mr Ismail, your younger brother...

2274
02:43:43,292 --> 02:43:46,417
- Older brother.
- Sorry.

2275
02:43:46,542 --> 02:43:49,626
What exactly does he do?

2276
02:43:51,334 --> 02:43:55,459
He hasn't worked for some time.
He used to work at the mine in Tozlu.

2277
02:43:55,584 --> 02:43:58,126
But unfortunately,
he got into some trouble.

2278
02:43:58,876 --> 02:44:01,376
He was in prison for six months.

2279
02:44:01,501 --> 02:44:02,959
And hasn't worked since.

2280
02:44:03,459 --> 02:44:06,917
If you don't mind me asking,

2281
02:44:07,042 --> 02:44:08,834
why was he jailed?

2282
02:44:08,959 --> 02:44:10,251
What did he do?

2283
02:44:10,376 --> 02:44:13,417
God knows, this is very embarrassing.

2284
02:44:13,542 --> 02:44:16,251
I'd rather you didn't know us like this.

2285
02:44:17,334 --> 02:44:20,917
But I won't hide something known to God.

2286
02:44:21,667 --> 02:44:23,751
Everyone probably knows anyway.

2287
02:44:25,417 --> 02:44:28,417
A few louts in town
were pestering his wife Sevda.

2288
02:44:28,542 --> 02:44:30,709
We only found this out later.

2289
02:44:31,501 --> 02:44:33,626
One night a loud noise woke us.

2290
02:44:33,751 --> 02:44:37,959
Ismail had stormed out of bed,
to chase someone in the street.

2291
02:44:40,834 --> 02:44:42,042
I'm ashamed to say,

2292
02:44:43,209 --> 02:44:46,667
they were stealing Sevda's underwear
off the line.

2293
02:44:46,792 --> 02:44:49,126
Ismail couldn't catch anybody.

2294
02:44:49,251 --> 02:44:51,542
But he took it out on Sevda.

2295
02:44:51,667 --> 02:44:53,751
The poor girl didn't even know.

2296
02:44:54,584 --> 02:44:57,751
Next day, in the market,

2297
02:44:57,876 --> 02:45:00,167
a few of the louts laughed at Ismail.

2298
02:45:00,834 --> 02:45:03,959
Ismail pulled out a knife
and stabbed one of them.

2299
02:45:07,126 --> 02:45:10,292
That's why he served six months in jail.

2300
02:45:12,584 --> 02:45:15,667
Well, Ismail was always wild.

2301
02:45:16,792 --> 02:45:19,334
He was never really close to anyone.

2302
02:45:20,376 --> 02:45:24,459
But when he got out,
he became even more suspicious and wild.

2303
02:45:24,584 --> 02:45:26,959
He even stopped speaking to people.

2304
02:45:27,084 --> 02:45:28,792
And then they fired him.

2305
02:45:29,834 --> 02:45:33,167
He became more introverted
and started drinking.

2306
02:45:34,209 --> 02:45:36,001
He doesn't drink at home though.

2307
02:45:37,917 --> 02:45:40,001
So he's not working now.

2308
02:45:41,084 --> 02:45:44,459
We had to pay for the guy's
operation and compensation.

2309
02:45:45,167 --> 02:45:47,584
And our debts grew.

2310
02:45:47,709 --> 02:45:51,959
With only my salary,
and Ismail not working,

2311
02:45:52,084 --> 02:45:53,667
it got difficult.

2312
02:45:53,792 --> 02:45:55,501
We couldn't pay the rent.

2313
02:45:56,251 --> 02:45:59,042
Mr Aydin is right, of course.

2314
02:45:59,584 --> 02:46:03,001
We couldn't pay for a few months,
causing him problems.

2315
02:46:04,042 --> 02:46:06,959
But hopefully, I'll find a second job.

2316
02:46:08,126 --> 02:46:09,417
I understand.

2317
02:46:10,167 --> 02:46:11,751
I hope it all works out.

2318
02:46:13,084 --> 02:46:17,417
I actually came to talk
about something related.

2319
02:46:18,501 --> 02:46:21,667
I won't take too much of your time.
It's already late.

2320
02:46:36,459 --> 02:46:38,834
Please take this and accept it.

2321
02:46:43,042 --> 02:46:44,126
What is this?

2322
02:46:44,584 --> 02:46:46,084
Open it.

2323
02:47:04,167 --> 02:47:05,792
What is this, Mrs Nihal?

2324
02:47:06,834 --> 02:47:08,709
Please don't misunderstand.

2325
02:47:09,417 --> 02:47:11,834
I want to give you this money.

2326
02:47:12,792 --> 02:47:14,334
Please take it.

2327
02:47:15,709 --> 02:47:18,792
Yes, but... I don't understand.

2328
02:47:18,917 --> 02:47:22,376
I mean, what is it for?
Why did you bring it to us?

2329
02:47:23,209 --> 02:47:24,417
Don't worry.

2330
02:47:24,542 --> 02:47:27,251
I don't want anything in return.

2331
02:47:27,376 --> 02:47:29,834
And I don't expect you
to pay it back.

2332
02:47:29,959 --> 02:47:34,834
Think of it as help from a friend,
and please accept it.

2333
02:47:36,667 --> 02:47:38,626
I'm terribly sorry, Mrs Nihal.

2334
02:47:38,751 --> 02:47:41,042
I really don't know what to say.

2335
02:47:41,959 --> 02:47:44,709
But this is a huge amount of money.

2336
02:47:46,042 --> 02:47:47,876
How can I accept this?

2337
02:*****,459 --> 02:47:50,376
There's enough to buy a house.

2338
02:47:51,209 --> 02:47:53,792
- What would people think?
- Mr Hamdi.

2339
02:47:54,417 --> 02:47:56,459
No one needs to know.

2340
02:47:57,917 --> 02:48:01,542
This can stay between you and me.

2341
02:48:13,001 --> 02:48:14,584
Welcome.

2342
02:48:14,709 --> 02:48:16,126
Thank you.

2343
02:48:16,792 --> 02:48:20,084
- Sorry for disturbing you so late.
- Not at all.

2344
02:48:20,209 --> 02:48:23,126
Mrs Nihal is Mr Aydin's wife,
our landlord...

2345
02:48:23,251 --> 02:48:25,126
I know. They just told me.

2346
02:48:40,001 --> 02:48:41,542
What's up?

2347
02:48:42,626 --> 02:48:45,501
Ismail, why don't you come
and sit down?

2348
02:48:46,626 --> 02:48:48,209
Come, have a seat.

2349
02:48:57,542 --> 02:49:01,501
Mrs Nihal was worried about Ilyas.

2350
02:49:01,626 --> 02:49:04,167
She came to wish him good health.

2351
02:49:05,376 --> 02:49:06,917
That's why she came.

2352
02:49:10,417 --> 02:49:11,834
What's this?

2353
02:49:15,126 --> 02:49:18,209
Mrs Nihal brought that money to give us.

2354
02:49:18,334 --> 02:49:20,417
Very kind of her.

2355
02:49:24,417 --> 02:49:26,292
For what reason?

2356
02:49:26,417 --> 02:49:29,959
Please don't get me wrong.
No special reason.

2357
02:49:30,084 --> 02:49:33,042
I thought you might need it, and so

2358
02:49:33,167 --> 02:49:35,584
you could get your stuff back.

2359
02:49:42,126 --> 02:49:44,042
What does Mr Aydin say about it?

2360
02:49:44,751 --> 02:49:46,376
He doesn't know.

2361
02:49:47,084 --> 02:49:48,792
He doesn't need to know, either.

2362
02:49:52,167 --> 02:49:53,917
Good.

2363
02:50:04,501 --> 02:50:05,584
But all this money...

2364
02:50:07,834 --> 02:50:09,667
isn't it a bit too much?

2365
02:50:12,126 --> 02:50:13,751
On what basis?

2366
02:50:15,001 --> 02:50:18,417
What made you think of this much?

2367
02:50:18,542 --> 02:50:21,042
- Look, I didn't think anything.
- Sorry.

2368
02:50:21,167 --> 02:50:23,501
I apologise. He's surprised, too.

2369
02:50:23,626 --> 02:50:27,334
Ismael, why not go
and wash your face or something?

2370
02:50:28,626 --> 02:50:30,167
No need.

2371
02:50:30,917 --> 02:50:33,709
Then I'll get you a coffee.

2372
02:50:33,834 --> 02:50:35,709
You better have one.

2373
02:50:35,834 --> 02:50:38,542
Mrs Nihal, let me get you another tea.

2374
02:50:39,084 --> 02:50:40,834
This one has gone cold.

2375
02:50:40,959 --> 02:50:44,292
- Don't bother.
- Please.

2376
02:50:46,459 --> 02:50:47,834
Sevda.

2377
02:50:58,126 --> 02:50:59,501
Now...

2378
02:51:04,001 --> 02:51:05,667
Let's see...

2379
02:51:07,251 --> 02:51:09,126
if the math is right.

2380
02:51:16,584 --> 02:51:19,334
Now if this amount is...

2381
02:51:21,501 --> 02:51:26,584
for little Ilyas who risked his life
to mend his father's broken pride.

2382
02:51:34,084 --> 02:51:35,584
And if this is...

2383
02:51:36,542 --> 02:51:38,792
for self-sacrificing brother Hamdi

2384
02:51:38,917 --> 02:51:43,251
who had to go hand-kissing
because he looks after five people.

2385
02:51:47,459 --> 02:51:48,917
And if this is

2386
02:51:49,751 --> 02:51:53,417
for the drunkard father Ismail

2387
02:51:53,542 --> 02:51:58,501
who got beaten up in front of his son
disgracing himself and his family...

2388
02:52:11,001 --> 02:52:12,751
There's still some left.

2389
02:52:15,251 --> 02:52:19,376
If that is for our heroine Mrs Nihal

2390
02:52:19,501 --> 02:52:23,251
who tries to ease her conscience
by doling out charity

2391
02:52:23,376 --> 02:52:27,126
to those less fortunate than her...

2392
02:52:28,751 --> 02:52:30,584
then this money is just enough.

2393
02:52:32,626 --> 02:52:34,376
You got the sums right.

2394
02:52:39,709 --> 02:52:42,251
A truly kind thought, but...

2395
02:52:44,292 --> 02:52:46,917
you forgot something,

2396
02:52:47,751 --> 02:52:49,167
Mrs Nihal.

2397
02:52:52,251 --> 02:52:54,042
The person in front of you

2398
02:52:55,459 --> 02:52:58,042
is a filthy drunkard
incapable of appreciating

2399
02:52:59,167 --> 02:53:01,042
all your kindness.

2400
02:54:35,459 --> 02:54:37,542
I'm now looking at these.

2401
02:54:38,209 --> 02:54:39,834
I'm looking.

2402
02:54:39,959 --> 02:54:43,209
And I'm thinking, man,
this isn't a life.

2403
02:54:43,334 --> 02:54:45,709
It's a fire scene in a stage act.

2404
02:54:45,834 --> 02:54:48,251
No fucking life, it's something else.

2405
02:54:48,376 --> 02:54:50,417
- True, very true.
- Am I wrong?

2406
02:54:50,542 --> 02:54:51,584
Right.

2407
02:54:51,709 --> 02:54:53,501
We have to stand straight.

2408
02:54:54,251 --> 02:54:57,167
We'll keep standing, standing upright.

2409
02:54:57,292 --> 02:55:01,084
We'll say, "Come on, hit me here.
Hit me here."

2410
02:55:01,209 --> 02:55:03,834
We'll stand straight as befits a man.

2411
02:55:03,959 --> 02:55:07,001
We won't bend, cry.
Won't sob like a baby.

2412
02:55:07,126 --> 02:55:08,126
Stand upright.

2413
02:55:08,834 --> 02:55:12,042
That's what befits us, Mr Aydin.

2414
02:55:12,667 --> 02:55:15,459
There are certain moral values
and beliefs today.

2415
02:55:15,584 --> 02:55:17,667
They derived from religions,

2416
02:55:17,792 --> 02:55:23,209
which have already been rejected
by many people in the world.

2417
02:55:23,334 --> 02:55:28,709
If I reject the basis of such values,
why live a life based on them?

2418
02:55:28,834 --> 02:55:32,376
Our life would be a lie then.

2419
02:55:32,501 --> 02:55:36,167
Either support the foundation
of these values

2420
02:55:36,959 --> 02:55:40,334
or consolidate or create new ones.

2421
02:55:40,459 --> 02:55:41,917
Suavi, my brother,

2422
02:55:42,042 --> 02:55:44,459
then you'll have to create them.

2423
02:55:44,584 --> 02:55:48,209
- It's great if you can create, mate.
- But listen.

2424
02:55:49,709 --> 02:55:51,876
We want to live life to the full

2425
02:55:52,667 --> 02:55:56,792
but other people
can criticise you for that.

2426
02:55:56,917 --> 02:56:01,084
You clash, you collide with them
when your paths cross.

2427
02:56:01,209 --> 02:56:07,001
But curious, innovative people
with strong personalities do it different.

2428
02:56:07,126 --> 02:56:10,084
Oddly enough, this conflict nourishes them.

2429
02:56:10,209 --> 02:56:13,584
In a way, it stretches them.

2430
02:56:14,626 --> 02:56:17,251
Conflicts expand their minds

2431
02:56:17,376 --> 02:56:19,792
and feed their creativity.

2432
02:56:19,917 --> 02:56:22,167
Now when I look at them,

2433
02:56:22,292 --> 02:56:26,417
they ignore the critics
because they have courage.

2434
02:56:26,542 --> 02:56:28,667
That's the way we should be.

2435
02:56:28,792 --> 02:56:31,209
They could come to us and say,

2436
02:56:31,334 --> 02:56:34,751
"You drink all that wine,
stuff your faces,

2437
02:56:34,876 --> 02:56:39,084
"then talk about helping
the schools of the poor."

2438
02:56:39,209 --> 02:56:42,376
I say we should ignore it
and move forward.

2439
02:56:42,501 --> 02:56:45,251
For example, after the earthquake,
six years ago,

2440
02:56:45,376 --> 02:56:48,459
when you didn't open your hotel to victims

2441
02:56:48,584 --> 02:56:52,167
but to aid organisations,

2442
02:56:52,292 --> 02:56:54,626
maybe to line your pockets...

2443
02:56:54,751 --> 02:56:58,167
I mean that's what some people might think.

2444
02:56:58,292 --> 02:57:00,667
That's quite interesting,
what he says.

2445
02:57:00,792 --> 02:57:04,667
Or they might reproach you
for being well-heeled.

2446
02:57:04,792 --> 02:57:06,376
- They might.
- Hold on.

2447
02:57:06,501 --> 02:57:08,251
Just a minute.

2448
02:57:08,376 --> 02:57:10,876
What's that got to do with it?

2449
02:57:11,001 --> 02:57:12,501
How did you bring this up?

2450
02:57:12,626 --> 02:57:14,376
I'm giving an example.

2451
02:57:14,501 --> 02:57:17,459
Are you trying to imply something?

2452
02:57:17,584 --> 02:57:22,334
If we didn't allow victims in,
there was obviously a good reason.

2453
02:57:22,459 --> 02:57:26,251
It's easy to make unfounded allegations,
with no knowledge.

2454
02:57:26,376 --> 02:57:32,209
Hundreds of people came from abroad.
Where were they supposed to stay?

2455
02:57:33,001 --> 02:57:34,834
Where were they to stay?

2456
02:57:34,959 --> 02:57:38,167
Who was supposed to save people
under the rubble?

2457
02:57:38,292 --> 02:57:41,251
- I didn't deny that...
- Nobody thinks about that.

2458
02:57:41,376 --> 02:57:43,042
It was just an example.

2459
02:57:43,876 --> 02:57:48,792
Come on, these judgments you make
don't suit you, Mr Blent.

2460
02:57:48,917 --> 02:57:51,834
- Who's judging? I was saying...
- That's no good.

2461
02:57:51,959 --> 02:57:55,626
I maybe didn't express myself right.
I meant something else.

2462
02:57:55,751 --> 02:57:59,542
- Levent, you said it wrong.
- I didn't.

2463
02:58:01,167 --> 02:58:03,751
There is some truth in what you said,

2464
02:58:03,876 --> 02:58:06,251
but you expressed it badly.

2465
02:58:06,376 --> 02:58:09,584
I'm just saying these people exist...

2466
02:58:09,709 --> 02:58:15,167
What's your example
got to do with my case?

2467
02:58:15,292 --> 02:58:18,542
I just said people could talk like that.

2468
02:58:18,667 --> 02:58:22,042
And another thing, hold on.

2469
02:58:22,167 --> 02:58:24,417
I'm saying the same thing.

2470
02:58:24,542 --> 02:58:29,834
There's no counting the donations
I've made over the years.

2471
02:58:29,959 --> 02:58:31,459
Great, but I'm saying...

2472
02:58:31,584 --> 02:58:33,334
Only yesterday,

2473
02:58:33,459 --> 02:58:37,417
I donated a huge sum to charity.
How about that?

2474
02:58:37,542 --> 02:58:42,376
And all these years
I have always kept my name a secret.

2475
02:58:42,501 --> 02:58:43,959
- He's right.
- Bravo.

2476
02:58:44,084 --> 02:58:46,501
I'm not criticising.

2477
02:58:46,626 --> 02:58:49,126
He just couldn't express himself.

2478
02:58:49,251 --> 02:58:50,501
But I still can't get rid of

2479
02:58:51,209 --> 02:58:54,876
the sarcasm and snide remarks.

2480
02:58:55,459 --> 02:58:58,126
Is it fair,
just because we've got money?

2481
02:58:58,251 --> 02:59:01,751
All I'm saying is
there are people like that.

2482
02:59:01,876 --> 02:59:03,792
They exist. God damn them.

2483
02:59:03,917 --> 02:59:05,792
I'd say God damn them too, but...

2484
02:59:05,917 --> 02:59:12,876
judging like that is unacceptable
before understanding all this.

2485
02:59:13,001 --> 02:59:15,042
I failed to express myself.

2486
02:59:15,167 --> 02:59:18,792
I call for some morality,
some conscience, please.

2487
02:59:18,917 --> 02:59:22,459
Speak up, son.
Tell him you put it wrong.

2488
02:59:22,584 --> 02:59:26,084
What's that got to do with it?
It's irrelevant.

2489
02:59:26,209 --> 02:59:27,751
It's not what he meant.

2490
02:59:27,876 --> 02:59:33,001
I don't see what it's got to do
with morality and conscience.

2491
02:59:33,126 --> 02:59:37,542
No, I can't accept such a judgment.

2492
02:59:37,667 --> 02:59:39,501
Implicating him is a problem.

2493
02:59:39,626 --> 02:59:42,542
Look, I've been silent for 15 years.

2494
02:59:42,667 --> 02:59:47,001
My words come out before my thoughts.
If I had shut up...

2495
02:59:47,126 --> 02:59:52,001
Is it fair to accuse me
just because we have a few bucks?

2496
02:59:52,126 --> 02:59:55,584
Did I create this world?
That's how the system is.

2497
02:59:55,709 --> 02:59:58,584
This is how God created it.

2498
02:59:58,709 --> 03:00:00,084
What can I do about it?

2499
03:00:00,209 --> 03:00:02,501
Justice doesn't even exist in nature.

2500
03:00:02,626 --> 03:00:04,709
So why should it exist here?

2501
03:00:04,834 --> 03:00:08,209
- Their talk is wrong.
- Are we meant to feel guilty?

2502
03:00:08,334 --> 03:00:11,501
I'm saying the same thing but...

2503
03:00:11,626 --> 03:00:15,292
you jumped on morality and conscience.

2504
03:00:15,417 --> 03:00:19,251
- I failed to express myself.
- He couldn't.

2505
03:00:19,376 --> 03:00:23,084
Couldn't express himself properly.
You got carried away, son.

2506
03:00:23,209 --> 03:00:24,959
You actually said nice things too.

2507
03:00:25,084 --> 03:00:27,751
Everything has a logic.

2508
03:00:27,876 --> 03:00:29,959
- He's right.
- Just like that.

2509
03:00:30,084 --> 03:00:31,751
Whatever.

2510
03:00:34,251 --> 03:00:35,876
We wined and dined.

2511
03:00:36,792 --> 03:00:39,209
Let me get up, brother.

2512
03:00:39,334 --> 03:00:41,376
I haven't slept for two days.

2513
03:00:41,501 --> 03:00:44,792
OK. I'll give you a blanket.
Come along.

2514
03:00:44,917 --> 03:00:47,126
You do that.

2515
03:00:47,959 --> 03:00:53,251
This drunkard must now shut up
or he'll keep rattling like a tin.

2516
03:00:53,376 --> 03:00:55,542
I wasn't going to talk though.

2517
03:00:56,334 --> 03:00:58,292
But before I leave...

2518
03:00:59,167 --> 03:01:01,709
this is your field, Mr Aydin...

2519
03:01:01,834 --> 03:01:03,126
Not at all.

2520
03:01:03,251 --> 03:01:06,876
I would like to quote Shakespeare,
by way of a conclusion.

2521
03:01:13,376 --> 03:01:14,834
"Conscience

2522
03:01:15,542 --> 03:01:18,501
"is but a word that cowards use

2523
03:01:19,626 --> 03:01:24,417
"devised at first
to keep the strong in awe.

2524
03:01:37,126 --> 03:01:40,501
"Our strong arms be our conscience,

2525
03:01:40,626 --> 03:01:43,126
"swords our law."

2526
03:01:46,709 --> 03:01:47,917
Good night.

2527
03:01:50,459 --> 03:01:52,084
Hold on, hold on.

2528
03:01:52,209 --> 03:01:58,001
Allow me to contribute
the following lines to this meeting.

2529
03:01:58,876 --> 03:02:00,667
As a reply.

2530
03:02:05,209 --> 03:02:06,751
Our infallible fate

2531
03:02:06,876 --> 03:02:10,001
is to be deceived
in everything we attempt.

2532
03:02:12,334 --> 03:02:16,626
I make brilliant plans each morning...

2533
03:02:19,292 --> 03:02:21,334
and fool about all day.

2534
03:02:30,126 --> 03:02:31,501
There you go.

2535
03:02:34,876 --> 03:02:37,417
You've pulled your trick again.

2536
03:02:48,292 --> 03:02:50,167
Are you all right?

2537
03:02:50,292 --> 03:02:52,251
Let it out, relax.

2538
03:02:53,459 --> 03:02:55,167
- Let it go.
- So sorry.

2539
03:02:55,292 --> 03:02:57,834
- Go on, let it all out.
- Oh my.

2540
03:02:57,959 --> 03:03:01,084
Sorry, I've made a real mess.

2541
03:03:01,209 --> 03:03:03,959
No problem. Leave it, come on.

2542
03:03:04,084 --> 03:03:06,292
- I'm sorry.
- Let's go out.

2543
03:03:06,417 --> 03:03:11,126
Plenty of fine fresh air outside.
And snow. You'll be fine.

2544
03:03:11,251 --> 03:03:14,626
Come on, my friend, come with me.

2545
03:03:15,334 --> 03:03:17,876
Easy. Don't force yourself.

2546
03:03:18,001 --> 03:03:19,584
Come on.

2547
03:03:20,292 --> 03:03:23,042
- I'm sorry.
- Let's go.

2548
03:03:23,167 --> 03:03:25,667
I'll lay you down here. Come on.

2549
03:03:33,001 --> 03:03:35,292
Let's walk over there,
then we're done.

2550
03:03:41,959 --> 03:03:44,001
He must be light, he's not sinking.

2551
03:07:03,917 --> 03:07:05,834
- Stop here.
- What is it?

2552
03:07:05,959 --> 03:07:07,667
Stop, stop.

2553
03:07:07,792 --> 03:07:10,084
I'm worried it won't move again.

2554
03:07:10,209 --> 03:07:11,834
- Reverse a bit.
- What?

2555
03:07:11,959 --> 03:07:13,376
Go back.

2556
03:07:32,584 --> 03:07:33,876
Stop.

2557
03:07:57,584 --> 03:07:59,001
What is it, Mr Aydin?

2558
03:08:00,959 --> 03:08:03,792
Nothing. Let's go.

2559
03:08:58,876 --> 03:09:00,376
Fatma!

2560
03:09:46,834 --> 03:09:48,626
<i>Nihal.</i>

2561
03:09:48,751 --> 03:09:50,292
<i>I didn't go away.</i>

2562
03:09:51,042 --> 03:09:52,709
<i>I couldn't.</i>

2563
03:09:55,334 --> 03:09:59,209
<i>Whether it's because I've grown old,
or I've gone mad,</i>

2564
03:09:59,959 --> 03:10:02,876
<i>or because I've become a different man,</i>

2565
03:10:03,001 --> 03:10:04,876
<i>think what you like.</i>

2566
03:10:06,001 --> 03:10:07,126
<i>I just don't know.</i>

2567
03:10:14,001 --> 03:10:18,167
<i>But this new man inside me
for a few days won't let me go away.</i>

2568
03:10:19,667 --> 03:10:22,001
<i>Please, don't ask me to go either.</i>

2569
03:10:28,917 --> 03:10:32,376
<i>I now understand
nothing is calling me to Istanbul.</i>

2570
03:10:34,167 --> 03:10:36,459
<i>Everything is alien to me there,</i>

2571
03:10:36,584 --> 03:10:38,834
<i>as it is everywhere else.</i>

2572
03:10:44,126 --> 03:10:47,751
<i>I want you to know
that I have no one but you.</i>

2573
03:10:50,876 --> 03:10:54,501
<i>And I miss you every minute,
every second that goes by.</i>

2574
03:10:56,959 --> 03:11:00,501
<i>But my pride
will never let me tell you this.</i>

2575
03:11:03,167 --> 03:11:06,542
<i>I know very well how terrible</i>

2576
03:11:06,667 --> 03:11:09,459
<i>or impossible it would be
to part from you.</i>

2577
03:11:11,459 --> 03:11:14,501
<i>Just as I know
that you do not love me anymore.</i>

2578
03:11:22,209 --> 03:11:24,584
<i>I know we can't go back
to the old days.</i>

2579
03:11:26,459 --> 03:11:28,292
<i>And there is no need to.</i>

2580
03:11:37,459 --> 03:11:39,417
<i>Take me with you like a servant,</i>

2581
03:11:42,292 --> 03:11:44,209
<i>like a slave.</i>

2582
03:11:56,251 --> 03:11:58,084
<i>And let us continue our life,</i>

2583
03:11:59,501 --> 03:12:03,376
<i>even if we do it your way.</i>

2584
03:12:13,001 --> 03:12:14,542
<i>Forgive me.</i>

HISTORY OF TURKISH THEATRE
