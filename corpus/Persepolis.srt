1
00:02:08,357 --> 00:02:10,274
TEHRAN

2
00:02:30,295 --> 00:02:32,046
Ticket and passport, please.

3
00:02:35,134 --> 00:02:38,136
Ma'am, I need
your ticket and passport.

4
00:02:56,822 --> 00:02:58,823
Marji, stop running!

5
00:02:59,241 --> 00:03:01,325
Look, there's Nioucha!

6
00:03:03,328 --> 00:03:05,288
Marji, haven't you grown!

7
00:03:05,456 --> 00:03:06,789
Got a present for me?

8
00:03:06,957 --> 00:03:08,958
How was Paris?
You saw Bruce Lee?

9
00:03:09,126 --> 00:03:10,793
And the Eiffel Tower?

10
00:03:10,961 --> 00:03:12,003
Welcome to Tehran.

11
00:03:12,171 --> 00:03:14,172
- We've missed you.
- I'll take your bags.

12
00:03:14,339 --> 00:03:16,007
No! I'll get them.

13
00:03:16,175 --> 00:03:17,842
Hurry, everyone's waiting!

14
00:03:18,385 --> 00:03:19,719
I remember...

15
00:03:19,887 --> 00:03:22,513
...I led a peaceful, uneventful life...

16
00:03:22,681 --> 00:03:24,182
...as a little girl.

17
00:03:24,475 --> 00:03:28,186
I loved fries with ketchup,
Bruce Lee was my hero...

18
00:03:28,353 --> 00:03:31,147
...I wore Adidas sneakers,
and had two obsessions:

19
00:03:31,315 --> 00:03:32,523
Shaving my legs one day...

20
00:03:32,691 --> 00:03:34,692
...and being the last prophet
of the galaxy.

21
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:35,860
Tehran 1978

22
00:03:45,412 --> 00:03:49,373
Slip a pencil under your breasts.
If it falls, they're great.

23
00:03:50,042 --> 00:03:52,084
If it sticks, they're crap.

24
00:03:52,795 --> 00:03:56,047
Shake her
and you'll fill a box of pencils.

25
00:03:58,008 --> 00:03:59,383
Calm down.

26
00:03:59,551 --> 00:04:01,844
They let me see him last week.

27
00:04:02,012 --> 00:04:03,930
The state he's in...

28
00:04:04,097 --> 00:04:06,390
They said they'd free him, though.

29
00:04:06,558 --> 00:04:09,060
- It'll soon be four years.
- Don't worry.

30
00:04:09,228 --> 00:04:12,355
This regime will collapse
sooner or later.

31
00:04:12,523 --> 00:04:14,398
Mom, Marji kicked my head!

32
00:04:15,067 --> 00:04:20,154
The dragon's revenge
is a bitter dish best served cold.

33
00:04:20,322 --> 00:04:22,698
This dragon is heading...

34
00:04:22,866 --> 00:04:24,075
...for a good thrashing.

35
00:04:29,248 --> 00:04:31,040
I, Marjane...

36
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:33,543
...future prophet, hereby decide:

37
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:36,796
First, everyone must behave well.

38
00:04:36,964 --> 00:04:40,258
Second, everyone must
keep their word.

39
00:04:40,425 --> 00:04:43,344
Third, everyone must do good.

40
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:47,932
Fourth, the poor must all eat
one roasted chicken every day.

41
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:51,394
Fifth, old women
will never suffer again.

42
00:04:51,562 --> 00:04:53,896
Well, Marji, in that case...

43
00:04:54,064 --> 00:04:55,982
...I'll be your first disciple.

44
00:04:56,149 --> 00:04:57,900
You will? Great!

45
00:04:58,068 --> 00:05:00,987
How'll you make sure
old women don't suffer?

46
00:05:01,154 --> 00:05:02,780
It'll be forbidden.

47
00:05:02,948 --> 00:05:05,449
Why didn't I think of that?

48
00:05:05,617 --> 00:05:06,993
What's going on?

49
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:13,291
Down with the Shah! Down with
the Shah! Down with the Shah!

50
00:05:20,716 --> 00:05:21,883
I knew it!

51
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:23,050
I told you so!

52
00:05:23,218 --> 00:05:24,427
I knew it!

53
00:05:25,804 --> 00:05:28,306
This is a historic moment!

54
00:05:35,314 --> 00:05:37,148
He'll pay for what he's done.

55
00:05:37,316 --> 00:05:40,443
Your poor father
will be avenged at last.

56
00:05:40,611 --> 00:05:43,154
The Shah can join his pals
in Washington.

57
00:05:43,322 --> 00:05:47,074
Personally,
I think I like the Shah.

58
00:05:48,035 --> 00:05:49,827
He was chosen by God.

59
00:05:50,954 --> 00:05:52,788
Absolutely.

60
00:05:52,956 --> 00:05:54,665
God told me so Himself.

61
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:56,918
God and my teacher too.

62
00:05:57,711 --> 00:06:00,004
The Shah wasn't chosen by God.

63
00:06:00,172 --> 00:06:02,340
That's not true! My teacher...

64
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:06,677
That's what people say.

65
00:06:06,845 --> 00:06:08,888
Here's what really happened.

66
00:06:09,056 --> 00:06:11,349
The truth is, 50 years ago...

67
00:06:11,516 --> 00:06:13,684
...the Shah's father,
an army officer...

68
00:06:13,852 --> 00:06:16,854
...wanted to overthrow
the Qadjar emperor.

69
00:06:17,022 --> 00:06:18,356
As Ataturk did in Turkey.

70
00:06:18,523 --> 00:06:21,984
I shall modernize Iran
and make it a republic!

71
00:06:22,152 --> 00:06:25,029
The English heard about this,
and one day...

72
00:06:25,197 --> 00:06:28,866
Hello! Why create a republic...

73
00:06:29,034 --> 00:06:31,369
...when you could be emperor?

74
00:06:31,536 --> 00:06:33,204
Me? Emperor?

75
00:06:33,455 --> 00:06:34,747
Of course!

76
00:06:34,915 --> 00:06:37,041
It's better than being president.

77
00:06:37,209 --> 00:06:39,293
You'll have all the power.

78
00:06:39,461 --> 00:06:41,253
A country like yours...

79
00:06:41,463 --> 00:06:44,840
...needs a strong man like you
to lead it.

80
00:06:46,218 --> 00:06:47,551
You have a point.

81
00:06:47,886 --> 00:06:49,387
Besides...

82
00:06:49,554 --> 00:06:53,015
...the religious leaders
are against a republic...

83
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:55,851
...and, frankly, they're right.

84
00:06:56,019 --> 00:06:57,853
What do I have to do?

85
00:06:58,021 --> 00:07:00,606
Nothing. Just give us the oil...

86
00:07:00,774 --> 00:07:03,234
...and we'll take care of the rest.

87
00:07:06,905 --> 00:07:09,407
I'm the king now!

88
00:07:09,574 --> 00:07:11,909
All your property is mine!

89
00:07:12,077 --> 00:07:14,286
So, in fact, he was a moron.

90
00:07:14,913 --> 00:07:15,913
Yes and no.

91
00:07:16,123 --> 00:07:18,916
He was a dictator,
but he modernized Iran.

92
00:07:19,084 --> 00:07:21,210
In a way, he loved his country...

93
00:07:21,378 --> 00:07:23,421
...unlike his son
who succeeded him.

94
00:07:23,588 --> 00:07:25,297
I'm the king now!

95
00:07:25,507 --> 00:07:27,591
I'm the light of the Aryans.

96
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,595
I'll make this country
the most modern one ever!

97
00:07:31,763 --> 00:07:34,890
Our people will regain
their splendor.

98
00:07:35,726 --> 00:07:38,519
Yes, the Shah's father
was very cruel.

99
00:07:38,687 --> 00:07:40,563
He even jailed your grandpa.

100
00:07:40,731 --> 00:07:42,732
But his son is ten times worse.

101
00:07:42,941 --> 00:07:44,442
Grandpa was in jail?

102
00:07:44,735 --> 00:07:46,777
Yes. He had royal blood.

103
00:07:46,945 --> 00:07:48,946
He was a Qadjar prince.

104
00:07:49,114 --> 00:07:51,282
The Shah's father ruined him.

105
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:54,618
He was jailed above all
for being a communist.

106
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:05,129
My grandpa was a Qadjar prince
and a "communiss."

107
00:09:09,569 --> 00:09:10,653
Dear God.

108
00:09:10,821 --> 00:09:13,531
You're alive!
I was worried sick.

109
00:09:13,698 --> 00:09:16,826
- They opened fire on the crowd.
- We had a close call, Grandma.

110
00:09:16,993 --> 00:09:20,204
Tadji and I ran,
but the soldiers cornered us.

111
00:09:20,622 --> 00:09:22,748
Those bastards took my film.

112
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:25,668
- They held us for hours.
- Marji was so excited.

113
00:09:25,836 --> 00:09:29,505
She went on about proles,
peasants, the class struggle...

114
00:09:29,673 --> 00:09:32,383
...and that bearded guy,
Che "Guevero."

115
00:09:32,551 --> 00:09:34,885
The boy shot next to us
wasn't even 20.

116
00:09:35,053 --> 00:09:36,929
What's happened
to this country?

117
00:09:37,097 --> 00:09:39,056
Right now, it's a shit hole, my dear.

118
00:09:39,224 --> 00:09:41,851
- Down with the Shah!
- Here we go again.

119
00:09:42,018 --> 00:09:44,436
Down with the Shah!
Down with the Shah!

120
00:09:45,355 --> 00:09:47,398
Marji, go to bed. Right now!

121
00:09:48,525 --> 00:09:52,570
Down with the Shah.
Down with the Shah.

122
00:09:54,072 --> 00:09:56,282
I've understood your revolt.

123
00:09:56,575 --> 00:10:00,452
Together, we shall try
to march towards democracy...

124
00:10:01,246 --> 00:10:03,372
...building the future hand in hand.

125
00:10:26,479 --> 00:10:27,605
Siamak!

126
00:10:27,772 --> 00:10:29,773
- They let you out.
- Hello, Ebi.

127
00:10:29,941 --> 00:10:32,193
It's Siamak. He's back.

128
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,819
Hello, Tadji.

129
00:10:34,613 --> 00:10:37,114
Come in.
We're so glad you're alive!

130
00:10:37,782 --> 00:10:38,782
Come in.

131
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:40,951
Don't just stand there.

132
00:10:43,997 --> 00:10:45,748
This must be Marjane.

133
00:10:45,999 --> 00:10:47,249
How you've grown.

134
00:10:47,417 --> 00:10:49,460
You were just a baby before.

135
00:10:49,628 --> 00:10:52,713
And now you're a young lady.

136
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,092
Who is that guy?

137
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:59,637
My father. He was in jail.

138
00:10:59,804 --> 00:11:01,597
He's a hero.

139
00:11:02,641 --> 00:11:05,643
There were scientists
who knew the whole body.

140
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:08,145
They knew what caused
the most pain.

141
00:11:10,732 --> 00:11:13,317
They whipped me
with cables so much...

142
00:11:13,485 --> 00:11:16,487
...my foot isn't like a foot anymore.

143
00:11:16,655 --> 00:11:17,696
And why?

144
00:11:17,864 --> 00:11:21,033
The foot's nerves
are linked to the brain.

145
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:22,993
The pain's incredible.

146
00:11:24,329 --> 00:11:27,331
Our torturers were trained
by the CIA.

147
00:11:29,751 --> 00:11:32,294
They certainly knew their stuff.

148
00:11:32,462 --> 00:11:34,672
What happened to Hamid?

149
00:11:36,091 --> 00:11:38,008
Hamid was killed.

150
00:11:39,344 --> 00:11:42,012
As a guerrilla member,
he suffered horribly.

151
00:11:42,514 --> 00:11:45,057
He had cyanide on him
just in case...

152
00:11:45,267 --> 00:11:47,393
...but he wasn't able to use it.

153
00:11:47,894 --> 00:11:50,020
He had the worst torture.

154
00:11:52,691 --> 00:11:54,858
The loser gets tortured to death.

155
00:11:55,026 --> 00:11:57,528
- Cool!
- What kind of torture?

156
00:11:58,196 --> 00:12:01,365
We'll hit him on the head
with a cable!

157
00:12:04,828 --> 00:12:07,496
But first he has to put this
in his mouth...

158
00:12:07,664 --> 00:12:09,540
...and chew it three times.

159
00:12:13,503 --> 00:12:15,004
Look. It's Ramine.

160
00:12:15,171 --> 00:12:19,008
I heard that his dad
was in the Shah's secret police.

161
00:12:19,301 --> 00:12:23,512
His dad killed a million people
with his own bare hands.

162
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,888
A million?

163
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:26,515
Absolutely!

164
00:12:26,683 --> 00:12:27,891
In their name...

165
00:12:28,059 --> 00:12:30,728
...we'll teach Ramine a lesson.

166
00:12:37,402 --> 00:12:39,403
We'll rip his eyes out.

167
00:12:51,249 --> 00:12:54,126
Marjane! What are you up to?

168
00:12:54,336 --> 00:12:56,587
- Marji found nails!
- We'll beat Ramine up.

169
00:12:56,755 --> 00:12:58,297
We'll rip his eyes out!

170
00:12:58,465 --> 00:13:01,342
What if I nailed your ears
to the wall?

171
00:13:03,553 --> 00:13:07,097
Go to your room and stay there
until I say so!

172
00:13:23,656 --> 00:13:25,491
Marjane,
what's the matter with you?

173
00:13:25,658 --> 00:13:28,660
That's no way
for a future prophet to behave.

174
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:32,122
But, Lord, Ramine's father
killed people.

175
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:35,459
Marjane.
That's not poor Ramine's fault.

176
00:13:35,627 --> 00:13:38,253
His father's crimes
aren't his doing.

177
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:41,256
The wicked will pay one day.

178
00:13:41,424 --> 00:13:43,467
Have faith in my justice.

179
00:13:43,635 --> 00:13:45,094
You cannot wield it.

180
00:13:45,261 --> 00:13:47,262
Your duty is to forgive.

181
00:13:52,394 --> 00:13:54,395
- Ramine...
- What do you want?

182
00:13:54,562 --> 00:13:58,440
It's not your fault
your father's a murderer.

183
00:13:58,608 --> 00:13:59,817
So I forgive you.

184
00:14:01,486 --> 00:14:03,612
He only ever killed communists...

185
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:05,656
...and communists are evil!

186
00:14:10,412 --> 00:14:12,830
In the months after the Shah left...

187
00:14:12,997 --> 00:14:14,873
...the country was euphoric.

188
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:16,959
Everyone had been a revolutionary.

189
00:14:17,127 --> 00:14:19,044
Everyone had fought the Shah.

190
00:14:19,212 --> 00:14:21,338
Our neighbor's birthmark...

191
00:14:21,506 --> 00:14:24,425
...had magically become
a war wound.

192
00:14:24,717 --> 00:14:27,553
Our teacher, who loved the Shah...

193
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:31,640
...made us tear up the photos
of the royal family in our books.

194
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:33,809
Political rallies thrived...

195
00:14:33,977 --> 00:14:35,686
...and the old internal enemies...

196
00:14:35,854 --> 00:14:38,689
...became national heroes.

197
00:14:38,857 --> 00:14:42,776
In this merry chaos,
Uncle Anoush came into my life.

198
00:14:42,944 --> 00:14:45,446
Things will get better now.

199
00:14:45,613 --> 00:14:47,865
Nothing will stop the people.

200
00:14:48,032 --> 00:14:51,743
We'll have a society
of justice and freedom at last.

201
00:14:52,245 --> 00:14:55,539
As Lenin predicted,
the proletariat will rule.

202
00:14:55,707 --> 00:14:58,417
Uncle Anoush,
how long were you in jail?

203
00:14:58,585 --> 00:15:01,503
- Nine years.
- Wow! More than Laly's dad.

204
00:15:01,671 --> 00:15:03,547
Are you married? A communist?

205
00:15:03,715 --> 00:15:07,217
Marji, give your uncle
time to digest.

206
00:15:07,385 --> 00:15:08,886
She's so inquisitive.

207
00:15:09,053 --> 00:15:11,513
You're right.
It's good to be curious.

208
00:15:11,681 --> 00:15:13,015
Have you digested?

209
00:15:13,183 --> 00:15:14,725
Enough! It's time for bed!

210
00:15:16,227 --> 00:15:19,980
Put your pajamas on.
I'll come and tell you everything.

211
00:15:21,065 --> 00:15:22,399
Elections are soon.

212
00:15:22,567 --> 00:15:27,404
Trust the people. They'll do all they can
to keep their freedom now.

213
00:15:27,572 --> 00:15:30,407
It can't be worse
than under the Shah.

214
00:15:31,075 --> 00:15:33,160
I'm ready!

215
00:15:33,328 --> 00:15:35,954
Watch out, she'll eat you alive.

216
00:15:36,122 --> 00:15:38,081
I'm ready!

217
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:40,751
I'll start at the beginning.

218
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:43,879
I was 18 when my Uncle Fereydoun
and his friends...

219
00:15:44,047 --> 00:15:48,258
...proclaimed the Iranian province
of Azerbaijan independent.

220
00:15:49,385 --> 00:15:54,014
Fereydoun named himself
the minister of justice.

221
00:15:55,266 --> 00:15:57,226
Democracy is based on justice.

222
00:15:57,393 --> 00:16:00,020
All men must be equal
before the law.

223
00:16:00,939 --> 00:16:03,565
We shared ideas,
so I became his secretary.

224
00:16:04,025 --> 00:16:05,776
This is just the beginning.

225
00:16:05,944 --> 00:16:07,778
We shall liberate Iran...

226
00:16:07,946 --> 00:16:10,572
...province by province, city by city.

227
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,074
I'm sure we will.

228
00:16:12,534 --> 00:16:14,618
It wasn't easy to follow him...

229
00:16:14,786 --> 00:16:17,120
...for my father was loyal
to the Shah.

230
00:16:17,288 --> 00:16:18,622
My son is a traitor!

231
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:21,458
Go and join my idiotic brother.

232
00:16:21,626 --> 00:16:24,962
You'll all end up shot, you hear?
Shot!

233
00:16:25,255 --> 00:16:27,673
My father turned out to be right.

234
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,132
And one morning...

235
00:16:29,592 --> 00:16:31,343
My God! Fereydoun!

236
00:16:31,636 --> 00:16:33,804
I had to flee. I had no choice.

237
00:16:34,472 --> 00:16:37,057
While my uncle
faced his fate alone.

238
00:16:57,954 --> 00:17:01,206
I walked for days
through the snow and blizzards.

239
00:17:01,374 --> 00:17:04,001
I was hungry and cold
but kept going.

240
00:17:05,587 --> 00:17:09,840
I crossed the Alborz Mountains
to go to my parents in Astara.

241
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:16,346
Who's bothering me this late?

242
00:17:16,514 --> 00:17:18,849
My God, Anoush!

243
00:17:19,017 --> 00:17:20,684
Our son. He's half-dead.

244
00:17:20,852 --> 00:17:22,185
My darling son!

245
00:17:24,147 --> 00:17:25,522
My son...

246
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:28,317
My darling son, forgive me.

247
00:17:28,693 --> 00:17:31,820
I couldn't stay.
The Shah's army was after me.

248
00:17:31,988 --> 00:17:33,697
I went into exile.

249
00:17:52,675 --> 00:17:55,552
I swam across the Aras River...

250
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:58,221
...and arrived in the USSR.

251
00:18:00,433 --> 00:18:01,892
What did you do then?

252
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:04,770
I went to Leningrad,
then Moscow.

253
00:18:04,937 --> 00:18:07,606
I did a doctorate
in Marxism-Leninism.

254
00:18:07,774 --> 00:18:10,275
But I missed my family
more and more.

255
00:18:10,443 --> 00:18:13,612
I tried to come back in disguise,
with forged papers...

256
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:15,072
...but it didn't work.

257
00:18:15,239 --> 00:18:16,615
They arrested me.

258
00:18:16,783 --> 00:18:18,116
You went to jail?

259
00:18:18,284 --> 00:18:20,410
Yes. You know...

260
00:18:20,578 --> 00:18:23,914
...I'm telling you this
because you need to know.

261
00:18:24,082 --> 00:18:26,333
The family memory must live on.

262
00:18:26,876 --> 00:18:29,961
Even if it's not easy
for you to understand.

263
00:18:30,171 --> 00:18:33,715
Don't worry, Uncle Anoush,
I'll never forget.

264
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:35,926
Were you married?

265
00:18:36,094 --> 00:18:38,929
It's late now. Go to sleep.

266
00:18:39,597 --> 00:18:41,056
This is for you.

267
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,809
I made it in prison.

268
00:18:44,519 --> 00:18:46,228
Out of bread.

269
00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:02,077
99.99% of the people
have voted democratically...

270
00:19:02,245 --> 00:19:03,954
...for the Islamic Republic.

271
00:19:04,122 --> 00:19:08,041
It's normal, every revolution
has a period of transition.

272
00:19:08,459 --> 00:19:10,460
Half the country is illiterate.

273
00:19:10,628 --> 00:19:15,549
Only nationalism and religion
can unite people.

274
00:19:16,676 --> 00:19:20,804
Mina and her family have left.
They say it's too dangerous here.

275
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,517
They found Mohsen
drowned in his bath.

276
00:19:26,644 --> 00:19:29,062
Don't worry.
Everything will be okay.

277
00:19:29,355 --> 00:19:33,859
Siamak and his family have fled.
The bastards killed his sister.

278
00:19:35,194 --> 00:19:37,404
Maybe we should leave Iran too.

279
00:19:37,572 --> 00:19:40,866
So you can be a maid
and I can drive a taxi?

280
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,786
We'll purge
anti-revolutionary elements.

281
00:19:44,996 --> 00:19:47,289
Only one law will prevail:

282
00:19:47,498 --> 00:19:48,498
That of blood.

283
00:20:00,094 --> 00:20:01,595
Marji...

284
00:20:04,348 --> 00:20:06,391
They've arrested Anoush.

285
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:08,143
I know.

286
00:20:11,439 --> 00:20:12,606
Dad...

287
00:20:12,774 --> 00:20:14,357
It will be all right.

288
00:20:15,067 --> 00:20:17,235
Do you want to do something
for him?

289
00:20:17,862 --> 00:20:21,364
He's allowed one visit.
He wants to see you.

290
00:20:24,118 --> 00:20:25,118
I'll go.

291
00:20:39,509 --> 00:20:40,759
Ten minutes.

292
00:20:47,767 --> 00:20:49,309
What a pretty dress.

293
00:20:49,936 --> 00:20:52,187
What a beautiful girl.

294
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:01,404
You know that your visit
honors me?

295
00:21:04,784 --> 00:21:07,869
You're the daughter
I'd have loved to have.

296
00:21:08,412 --> 00:21:09,830
You'll see.

297
00:21:09,997 --> 00:21:12,958
One day, the proletariat will rule.

298
00:21:13,251 --> 00:21:14,751
Here.

299
00:21:14,919 --> 00:21:17,254
I made you another bread swan.

300
00:21:17,922 --> 00:21:20,298
It's the first one's uncle.

301
00:21:25,388 --> 00:21:27,472
Star of my life...

302
00:21:47,368 --> 00:21:49,619
What's wrong, my child?

303
00:21:49,787 --> 00:21:51,037
Don't be sad.

304
00:21:51,205 --> 00:21:52,539
Shut up.

305
00:21:52,707 --> 00:21:54,958
You didn't stop them
from killing him.

306
00:21:55,376 --> 00:21:57,210
It's not my fault. Men did it.

307
00:21:57,378 --> 00:21:59,754
Shut up! Never come back again!

308
00:21:59,922 --> 00:22:04,467
Get out!

309
00:22:25,907 --> 00:22:29,534
One year after the revolution,
Iraq attacked Iran.

310
00:22:29,702 --> 00:22:32,787
Saddam struck
a vulnerable country.

311
00:22:33,205 --> 00:22:36,333
The revolution
and purges in the army...

312
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,543
...had vastly weakened us.

313
00:22:38,711 --> 00:22:41,004
In the name of
fighting the external enemy...

314
00:22:41,172 --> 00:22:43,632
...the state exterminated
the internal one:

315
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:46,676
The opponents
to the Shah's regime.

316
00:22:47,219 --> 00:22:50,597
Arrests and executions
took place daily.

317
00:22:50,765 --> 00:22:52,849
Everyone was afraid.

318
00:22:53,017 --> 00:22:57,062
The new government adopted
even more repressive laws.

319
00:22:57,563 --> 00:22:58,855
In two years...

320
00:22:59,023 --> 00:23:01,942
...every aspect
of our lives changed.

321
00:23:02,109 --> 00:23:03,818
And so did we.

322
00:23:05,696 --> 00:23:08,657
All right, children!
On the heart for our martyrs!

323
00:23:08,824 --> 00:23:10,617
Daughters and sons of Iran...

324
00:23:11,202 --> 00:23:13,662
...the war has killed
our best children.

325
00:23:13,829 --> 00:23:17,082
The truth will soon rise up
from their blood.

326
00:23:17,249 --> 00:23:19,042
For whom did they die?

327
00:23:19,585 --> 00:23:23,380
For us!

328
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:33,640
Martyr.

329
00:23:33,808 --> 00:23:35,976
Martyr!

330
00:23:36,143 --> 00:23:37,936
Finish me!

331
00:23:38,104 --> 00:23:39,562
What are you doing?

332
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:42,065
I'm suffering. Can't you see?

333
00:23:42,733 --> 00:23:44,192
Go to class now!

334
00:23:44,568 --> 00:23:47,612
Tehran 1982

335
00:23:48,239 --> 00:23:50,615
The veil stands for freedom.

336
00:23:50,783 --> 00:23:54,703
A decent woman shelters herself
from men's eyes.

337
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:58,623
A woman who shows herself
will burn in hell.

338
00:23:58,791 --> 00:24:00,125
Hey, have you seen this?

339
00:24:00,292 --> 00:24:03,086
Our soldiers die every day
on our borders...

340
00:24:03,254 --> 00:24:06,047
...to save our dear land
from indecency.

341
00:24:06,257 --> 00:24:07,257
Look!

342
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,385
Abba is for wimps.

343
00:24:18,144 --> 00:24:20,812
Leave in single file. Hurry!

344
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,201
Mom, what's for dinner?

345
00:24:35,786 --> 00:24:37,495
How about a nice chili?

346
00:24:37,663 --> 00:24:39,873
Yeah! It'll make us fart!

347
00:24:41,459 --> 00:24:42,542
Give me that!

348
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:44,127
I saw it first!

349
00:24:44,295 --> 00:24:46,379
- Sure, bitch!
- Stop that!

350
00:24:46,714 --> 00:24:49,299
Look at you, fighting like animals.

351
00:24:49,717 --> 00:24:51,634
We should show solidarity.

352
00:24:52,803 --> 00:24:55,138
- What's her problem?
- Who asked you?

353
00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:08,943
Your scarf, sister.

354
00:25:11,655 --> 00:25:12,739
You, woman!

355
00:25:12,907 --> 00:25:16,034
Sir, you don't say "woman,"
you say "ma'am."

356
00:25:16,702 --> 00:25:18,995
- Show some respect, please.
- Respect you?

357
00:25:19,163 --> 00:25:22,707
I screw women like you
and dump them in the trash.

358
00:25:23,459 --> 00:25:24,876
Get in!

359
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:44,187
Are you okay?

360
00:25:44,522 --> 00:25:46,731
Yes, dear, I'm fine.

361
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:51,027
Move it!

362
00:25:52,196 --> 00:25:53,863
Shut up, bastard!

363
00:27:43,098 --> 00:27:45,975
Mom, you have to give me
50 tomans.

364
00:27:46,143 --> 00:27:47,769
Really? What for?

365
00:27:47,937 --> 00:27:50,605
They're selling tapes
on Gandhi Avenue.

366
00:27:50,773 --> 00:27:51,814
Bee Gees tapes?

367
00:27:51,982 --> 00:27:54,609
Mom! The Bee Gees suck!

368
00:27:59,657 --> 00:28:01,074
"Estivie" Wonder.

369
00:28:01,242 --> 00:28:02,408
Julio Iglesias.

370
00:28:02,576 --> 00:28:03,826
Pink Floyd.

371
00:28:04,161 --> 00:28:05,495
"Jickael Mackson."

372
00:28:06,121 --> 00:28:08,331
Lipstick, varnish, playing cards.

373
00:28:08,499 --> 00:28:10,166
Iron Maiden.

374
00:28:11,293 --> 00:28:12,752
- How much?
- One hundred tomans.

375
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,588
- Fifty.
- Sixty.

376
00:28:15,756 --> 00:28:17,340
- Fifty.
- Fifty.

377
00:28:21,512 --> 00:28:22,720
What's that outfit?

378
00:28:23,222 --> 00:28:24,639
And those punk shoes?

379
00:28:24,807 --> 00:28:26,516
- What punk shoes?
- Those!

380
00:28:26,725 --> 00:28:28,142
They're sneakers.

381
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:29,519
That style is punk.

382
00:28:29,687 --> 00:28:32,063
I'm on my school's basketball team.

383
00:28:32,231 --> 00:28:34,190
Is that a basketball jacket?

384
00:28:34,358 --> 00:28:36,317
What's that? Michael Jackson!

385
00:28:36,527 --> 00:28:38,569
That symbol of Western decadence!

386
00:28:38,737 --> 00:28:41,197
No, ma'am, it's...

387
00:28:42,199 --> 00:28:43,199
Malcolm X!

388
00:28:43,367 --> 00:28:45,118
- Michael Jackson!
- Your scarf, slut!

389
00:28:45,286 --> 00:28:47,078
You're coming with us!

390
00:28:47,246 --> 00:28:49,205
I'm sorry. It won't happen again.

391
00:28:49,373 --> 00:28:51,624
Ma'am, my mother is dead.

392
00:28:51,792 --> 00:28:53,501
My stepmother's so cruel.

393
00:28:53,669 --> 00:28:55,753
If I'm late, she'll kill me!

394
00:28:55,921 --> 00:28:58,256
She'll burn me with an iron.

395
00:28:58,465 --> 00:29:01,342
She'll make my dad
put me in an orphanage!

396
00:29:01,552 --> 00:29:02,593
Have mercy!

397
00:29:02,761 --> 00:29:05,972
Please, ma'am, have mercy!

398
00:29:43,844 --> 00:29:48,890
Today, our army destroyed
63 Iraqi tanks and 26 fighter planes.

399
00:29:49,266 --> 00:29:52,477
Our martyrs' blood
irrigates our land...

400
00:29:52,644 --> 00:29:55,313
...and feeds deserts of hope.

401
00:29:55,481 --> 00:29:59,317
To die a martyr is to inject blood
into the veins of society.

402
00:30:12,373 --> 00:30:15,249
Is everything all right,
Mrs. Nassrine?

403
00:30:15,417 --> 00:30:16,667
No, it isn't.

404
00:30:16,835 --> 00:30:19,212
They gave my son this at school.

405
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:22,006
They said
that if he fights and dies...

406
00:30:22,174 --> 00:30:25,385
...this key will get him into heaven.
This plastic key!

407
00:30:25,803 --> 00:30:28,971
They said heaven is full of food...

408
00:30:29,139 --> 00:30:31,140
...women, gold houses
and diamonds!

409
00:30:31,308 --> 00:30:32,975
Women?

410
00:30:33,936 --> 00:30:36,604
Well, he's 14.
Women interest him.

411
00:30:36,772 --> 00:30:38,272
I've suffered so much.

412
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:41,359
I've raised five children
with my tears.

413
00:30:41,527 --> 00:30:44,695
Now they want to swap my oldest
for this key.

414
00:30:44,863 --> 00:30:47,156
I've always been devout.

415
00:30:47,324 --> 00:30:50,618
I've prayed, I've worn the veil,
I've obeyed.

416
00:30:51,328 --> 00:30:54,247
But I can't believe in anything
anymore.

417
00:30:55,332 --> 00:30:56,582
It's me. Did you hear?

418
00:30:56,750 --> 00:31:00,795
They arrested the Roshanis.
They found alcohol and playing cards.

419
00:31:00,963 --> 00:31:02,964
Why are you covering your head?

420
00:31:05,342 --> 00:31:06,843
For your husband.

421
00:31:07,177 --> 00:31:10,054
That's how we were brought up.

422
00:31:11,223 --> 00:31:12,348
Don't worry.

423
00:31:12,516 --> 00:31:14,559
I'll talk to your son.

424
00:31:15,185 --> 00:31:19,188
Thanks to my parents,
her son never went to war.

425
00:31:21,525 --> 00:31:22,942
Between air raids...

426
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:25,862
...government repression
and spying neighbors...

427
00:31:26,029 --> 00:31:28,614
...life tried to follow its course.

428
00:31:36,206 --> 00:31:39,709
To make everything bearable,
people had parties...

429
00:31:39,877 --> 00:31:41,711
...safe from prying eyes.

430
00:31:41,879 --> 00:31:43,754
They were often boozy.

431
00:31:43,922 --> 00:31:45,798
Alcohol was banned...

432
00:31:45,966 --> 00:31:48,718
...but my uncle Taher
supplied us with wine.

433
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:53,681
He had built a winemaking lab
in his basement.

434
00:31:53,849 --> 00:31:55,057
Mrs. Nassrine...

435
00:31:55,225 --> 00:31:58,769
...who cleaned for him too,
helped crush the grapes.

436
00:31:58,937 --> 00:32:01,314
God forgive me.

437
00:32:02,441 --> 00:32:04,609
Attending these parties was risky.

438
00:32:04,776 --> 00:32:08,154
But it was the only bit of freedom
we had left.

439
00:32:12,034 --> 00:32:13,075
Come on.

440
00:32:13,243 --> 00:32:14,785
Get out!

441
00:32:14,953 --> 00:32:16,829
ID, registration, license.

442
00:32:18,916 --> 00:32:20,249
Come here.

443
00:32:20,751 --> 00:32:22,293
Breathe!

444
00:32:22,461 --> 00:32:23,711
- Been drinking?
- No.

445
00:32:23,879 --> 00:32:27,006
- Liar. You Westernized trash.
- Enough.

446
00:32:27,174 --> 00:32:30,009
I work for this country.
How dare you!

447
00:32:30,344 --> 00:32:32,887
- Forgive him.
- Shut up!

448
00:32:33,055 --> 00:32:36,015
I could be your mother.
How old are you? Fifteen?

449
00:32:36,183 --> 00:32:38,601
Sixteen? My daughter is 13.

450
00:32:41,271 --> 00:32:43,397
If not for your wife,
you'd be in hell.

451
00:32:43,565 --> 00:32:44,857
Thank you!

452
00:32:45,859 --> 00:32:49,278
Get in. Let's see
if you have bottles at home.

453
00:32:49,905 --> 00:32:52,823
Grandma, Marji, go up first.
I'll stall them.

454
00:32:52,991 --> 00:32:56,160
- Empty all the bottles.
- But how?

455
00:32:56,328 --> 00:32:59,789
Don't worry, I was used to it
with your father.

456
00:32:59,957 --> 00:33:02,458
I always had to hide his tracks.

457
00:33:03,544 --> 00:33:07,964
Our neighbor is an elderly man
with a heart condition.

458
00:33:08,131 --> 00:33:11,008
Any sudden noise could kill him.

459
00:33:11,677 --> 00:33:14,303
Perhaps we can
work something out...

460
00:33:14,471 --> 00:33:16,514
Where are you two going?

461
00:33:16,682 --> 00:33:18,474
I have diabetes, my boy.

462
00:33:18,642 --> 00:33:20,977
Without syrup, I'm going to faint.

463
00:33:21,353 --> 00:33:23,646
Diabetes? Like my mother.

464
00:33:23,814 --> 00:33:25,648
All right.

465
00:33:45,752 --> 00:33:47,295
Where are they?

466
00:33:47,462 --> 00:33:51,841
Arrogant, but no ideology.
A few bills made them forget.

467
00:33:53,343 --> 00:33:55,344
You didn't throw it all out?

468
00:33:56,179 --> 00:33:57,179
Yes, we did.

469
00:33:57,347 --> 00:33:59,181
Shit...

470
00:34:09,109 --> 00:34:11,277
It's his heart again.

471
00:34:11,445 --> 00:34:14,322
They were after communists
near our house.

472
00:34:14,489 --> 00:34:16,032
They threw a grenade.

473
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:18,034
Taher couldn't take it.

474
00:34:18,201 --> 00:34:21,078
I found him on the floor
in the living room.

475
00:34:21,246 --> 00:34:22,788
It will be all right.

476
00:34:22,956 --> 00:34:24,749
No, it won't.

477
00:34:24,916 --> 00:34:27,835
He needs open-heart surgery.

478
00:34:28,003 --> 00:34:30,588
They can't do it here.

479
00:34:31,214 --> 00:34:33,507
They say he has to go to England.

480
00:34:33,967 --> 00:34:36,927
I went to see the hospital director.

481
00:34:37,638 --> 00:34:39,055
You won't believe it.

482
00:34:39,222 --> 00:34:40,598
Know who he is?

483
00:34:40,766 --> 00:34:43,184
My old window washer!

484
00:34:43,518 --> 00:34:47,480
I pretended not to know him
so as not to humiliate him.

485
00:34:47,648 --> 00:34:51,942
With the borders closed,
only the very sick can go abroad.

486
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:54,236
It's his third coronary.

487
00:34:54,488 --> 00:34:57,406
He needs an operation abroad
or he'll die!

488
00:34:57,574 --> 00:34:59,450
We'll do our best.

489
00:34:59,618 --> 00:35:01,952
If God wills it, he'll get better.

490
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,621
It all depends on God.

491
00:35:03,997 --> 00:35:07,458
I need your authorization
to get his passport.

492
00:35:07,793 --> 00:35:09,919
If God wills it.

493
00:35:10,128 --> 00:35:13,589
Thanks to a beard and suit
this idiotic window washer...

494
00:35:13,757 --> 00:35:15,341
...runs a hospital now!

495
00:35:15,509 --> 00:35:18,719
My husband's fate
depends on a window washer!

496
00:35:18,929 --> 00:35:21,972
He's so religious
he won't look at a woman.

497
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:23,265
The stupid bastard!

498
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:28,145
I know someone
who makes passports.

499
00:35:28,313 --> 00:35:30,314
I'll go see him. It'll all be okay.

500
00:35:30,482 --> 00:35:32,650
Wait. I'll come too.

501
00:35:36,571 --> 00:35:38,155
Where did I put it?

502
00:35:39,157 --> 00:35:41,033
Here it is! Look at this.

503
00:35:41,201 --> 00:35:42,451
It looks real, huh?

504
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:46,372
A whole month's work went into this.

505
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:49,041
You're cute. What's your name?

506
00:35:49,209 --> 00:35:51,460
How long to make a passport?

507
00:35:52,504 --> 00:35:54,714
Passports are in high demand.

508
00:35:55,507 --> 00:35:57,758
They're how I make my living now.

509
00:35:58,051 --> 00:35:59,844
Usually, it takes two weeks.

510
00:36:00,011 --> 00:36:01,721
But I can do it in one.

511
00:36:01,888 --> 00:36:04,473
Perfect, but hurry.

512
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:08,894
It's only Niloufar.

513
00:36:09,646 --> 00:36:13,274
Meet Ebi. I told you
about his brother Anoush.

514
00:36:13,442 --> 00:36:14,483
Hello.

515
00:36:14,651 --> 00:36:16,193
She's a communist too.

516
00:36:16,361 --> 00:36:20,364
Her brother was my messenger boy
so I hide her here.

517
00:36:20,532 --> 00:36:22,742
It's the only place she's safe.

518
00:36:39,634 --> 00:36:41,927
Is he dumb or what?

519
00:36:42,095 --> 00:36:43,637
He'll get crushed.

520
00:36:44,222 --> 00:36:46,807
There! What did I tell you?

521
00:36:53,231 --> 00:36:54,482
Don't look.

522
00:36:54,649 --> 00:36:56,525
- It's horrible.
- Grandma, stop it!

523
00:36:59,154 --> 00:37:00,488
What a load of crap.

524
00:37:00,655 --> 00:37:02,740
The Japanese
either gut themselves...

525
00:37:02,908 --> 00:37:06,327
...or make hideous monsters.
That's all they ever seem to do.

526
00:37:13,043 --> 00:37:15,669
Grandma,
will Uncle Taher die?

527
00:37:15,837 --> 00:37:18,088
- Of course.
- You think so?

528
00:37:18,256 --> 00:37:21,300
Without a passport,
he won't make it.

529
00:37:24,137 --> 00:37:26,722
- He smoked too much.
- Bullshit!

530
00:37:27,098 --> 00:37:29,391
His heart's not failing
from cigarettes.

531
00:37:29,559 --> 00:37:31,977
His kids are too far away.

532
00:37:32,604 --> 00:37:35,564
A portion of beans,
piping hot, please.

533
00:37:36,441 --> 00:37:39,109
Children always leave.
That's normal.

534
00:37:39,277 --> 00:37:43,697
But having to part with them at 13
due to an absurd war...

535
00:37:44,449 --> 00:37:45,908
...that breaks your heart.

536
00:37:48,662 --> 00:37:52,081
In Taher's shoes,
I'd be dead and buried by now.

537
00:37:52,582 --> 00:37:56,252
- May God eradicate these barbarians.
- May God hear you.

538
00:38:08,557 --> 00:38:12,101
Khosrow, it's you.
Is the package ready?

539
00:38:12,269 --> 00:38:15,479
They arrested Niloufar
and trashed my place!

540
00:38:29,578 --> 00:38:31,787
Niloufar was executed.

541
00:38:33,665 --> 00:38:37,793
Khosrow fled to Turkey
and then to Sweden.

542
00:38:42,465 --> 00:38:44,633
Three weeks later...

543
00:38:44,801 --> 00:38:46,635
...we buried Uncle Taher.

544
00:38:49,347 --> 00:38:51,515
The war intensified.

545
00:38:56,646 --> 00:38:58,188
Let me through.

546
00:38:58,356 --> 00:39:01,108
Excuse me. Let me through.

547
00:39:01,484 --> 00:39:02,568
Stop!

548
00:39:02,736 --> 00:39:04,653
I live over there.

549
00:39:04,821 --> 00:39:06,655
Go on.

550
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:29,678
- Marji!
- Mom.

551
00:39:31,181 --> 00:39:32,306
Are you hurt?

552
00:39:32,474 --> 00:39:34,350
No, sweetie, we're fine.

553
00:39:34,517 --> 00:39:36,226
Where did the missile land?

554
00:39:37,812 --> 00:39:40,522
The Baba Levy's house.

555
00:40:03,129 --> 00:40:07,424
Under our new government,
we no longer have political prisoners.

556
00:40:07,634 --> 00:40:08,717
Ma'am?

557
00:40:08,885 --> 00:40:11,512
We have paid a high price
for our liberty.

558
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,555
- Ma'am.
- What now, Satrapi?

559
00:40:13,723 --> 00:40:18,143
My uncle was jailed by the Shah,
but the new regime had him shot.

560
00:40:18,311 --> 00:40:21,689
We have gone from 3,000 prisoners
under the Shah...

561
00:40:21,856 --> 00:40:23,482
...to 300,000 with you.

562
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:26,568
How dare you lie to us like this?

563
00:40:26,736 --> 00:40:28,153
Stop that!

564
00:40:37,747 --> 00:40:40,040
- Who was it?
- The principal.

565
00:40:40,208 --> 00:40:42,710
Marji told her teacher off.

566
00:40:42,877 --> 00:40:45,462
- Again?
- Just like her uncle.

567
00:40:45,672 --> 00:40:49,425
What? You want her
to end up like him? Executed?

568
00:40:49,592 --> 00:40:51,301
You know what they do
to young girls?

569
00:40:51,469 --> 00:40:53,971
You know what they did to Niloufar?

570
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:58,267
It's illegal to kill a virgin,
so a guard married her...

571
00:40:58,435 --> 00:41:00,227
...and took her virginity first!

572
00:41:00,395 --> 00:41:02,187
You know what that means?

573
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:06,191
If they touch you, I'll kill them!

574
00:41:07,193 --> 00:41:10,821
Shortly after,
they decided to send me abroad.

575
00:41:11,281 --> 00:41:14,742
Since I had attended
the French school in Tehran...

576
00:41:14,909 --> 00:41:17,661
...I went to the French school
in Vienna.

577
00:41:17,829 --> 00:41:19,830
My father got me a visa.

578
00:41:19,998 --> 00:41:23,625
I'd stay with my mother's friend
and her family.

579
00:41:23,793 --> 00:41:25,544
The day before I left...

580
00:41:25,712 --> 00:41:27,713
...Grandma slept at our house.

581
00:41:29,007 --> 00:41:33,135
Every morning, she'd put jasmine
in her bra to smell good.

582
00:41:33,803 --> 00:41:37,306
When she undressed,
the flowers fell from her breasts.

583
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,475
It was magical.

584
00:41:39,642 --> 00:41:43,479
How come your breasts
are so round at your age?

585
00:41:44,147 --> 00:41:48,817
I soak them in a bowl of iced water
for ten minutes every day.

586
00:41:51,029 --> 00:41:52,696
I'll miss you.

587
00:41:53,573 --> 00:41:55,991
I'll come to see you.

588
00:41:57,619 --> 00:41:59,078
Listen.

589
00:41:59,245 --> 00:42:03,874
I don't like to preach,
but here's some advice.

590
00:42:04,042 --> 00:42:07,461
You'll meet a lot of jerks in life.

591
00:42:07,629 --> 00:42:12,007
If they hurt you,
remember it's because they're stupid.

592
00:42:12,175 --> 00:42:15,094
Don't react to their cruelty.

593
00:42:15,261 --> 00:42:18,931
There's nothing worse
than bitterness and revenge.

594
00:42:19,099 --> 00:42:23,852
Keep your dignity
and be true to yourself.

595
00:42:29,317 --> 00:42:31,527
Everything will be all right.

596
00:42:32,195 --> 00:42:34,530
No tears. Think of your future.

597
00:42:34,697 --> 00:42:36,448
Europe awaits you.

598
00:42:36,616 --> 00:42:39,785
When you get to Vienna,
have a Sachertorte.

599
00:42:39,953 --> 00:42:41,912
It's a delicious chocolate cake.

600
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:43,664
We'll come to visit.

601
00:42:43,832 --> 00:42:45,124
You're a big girl.

602
00:42:45,291 --> 00:42:46,750
No tears.

603
00:42:46,918 --> 00:42:50,087
- Dad.
- Enough. You have to go now.

604
00:42:50,421 --> 00:42:53,757
Never forget who you are
and where you're from.

605
00:42:53,925 --> 00:42:55,717
My daughter.

606
00:42:56,886 --> 00:42:59,388
- Mom.
- My little Marji.

607
00:44:01,159 --> 00:44:02,659
Europe awaited.

608
00:44:02,869 --> 00:44:04,953
But not the way I imagined.

609
00:44:05,413 --> 00:44:07,956
After a few days
at my mother's friend's...

610
00:44:08,124 --> 00:44:11,668
...she decided her place
was too small.

611
00:44:13,129 --> 00:44:14,796
She found lodgings...

612
00:44:14,964 --> 00:44:17,257
...where I'd be fine...

613
00:44:17,425 --> 00:44:19,301
...according to her.

614
00:44:35,443 --> 00:44:36,652
What?

615
00:45:15,191 --> 00:45:16,650
I was delighted...

616
00:45:16,818 --> 00:45:21,321
...to find stores packed with goods
that had vanished at home.

617
00:45:22,991 --> 00:45:24,658
For a while...

618
00:45:24,826 --> 00:45:27,869
...going to the supermarket
was my favorite pastime.

619
00:45:28,037 --> 00:45:32,332
My favorite pastime.

620
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:36,253
In short,
I needed to make friends fast.

621
00:45:41,092 --> 00:45:44,386
Luckily, at school,
I could understand the others...

622
00:45:44,554 --> 00:45:46,471
...and could get myself understood.

623
00:45:46,889 --> 00:45:48,640
Got a smoke?

624
00:45:50,643 --> 00:45:53,854
I was the center of attention
for all the outsiders.

625
00:45:54,022 --> 00:45:57,524
People like Momo, Thierry,
Olivier and Eve.

626
00:45:57,692 --> 00:46:00,485
My nationality and story
fascinated them.

627
00:46:00,695 --> 00:46:03,071
You saw a revolution and a war?

628
00:46:03,239 --> 00:46:04,698
Well, yeah.

629
00:46:04,866 --> 00:46:07,409
- You saw lots of dead people?
- A few.

630
00:46:09,287 --> 00:46:10,579
That's wild.

631
00:46:15,918 --> 00:46:18,045
I was soon part of the gang.

632
00:46:18,212 --> 00:46:20,714
Momo introduced me
to nonchalance...

633
00:46:20,882 --> 00:46:22,966
...the concept of forced nihilism...

634
00:46:23,134 --> 00:46:25,093
...and Vienna's sub-culture.

635
00:46:39,609 --> 00:46:42,444
I had trouble adapting at first.

636
00:46:43,529 --> 00:46:46,448
But then I thought, "Why not?"

637
00:46:48,951 --> 00:46:51,953
I convinced myself
I'd found my place.

638
00:46:52,914 --> 00:46:54,998
But I wasn't like them.

639
00:46:55,166 --> 00:46:58,627
As school holidays reminded me.

640
00:46:58,795 --> 00:47:00,253
Shit. Christmas again.

641
00:47:00,421 --> 00:47:03,340
With the whole damn family too.

642
00:47:03,549 --> 00:47:06,635
All due to
a crappy American invention.

643
00:47:06,803 --> 00:47:09,137
Santa Claus wears red and white...

644
00:47:09,305 --> 00:47:11,807
Because he was
a Coca-Cola mascot.

645
00:47:11,974 --> 00:47:14,643
I'll be bored shitless
in Monte Carlo.

646
00:47:14,811 --> 00:47:16,937
Monte Carlo's nothing.

647
00:47:17,105 --> 00:47:20,148
I have to go to Brazil
to see my dad.

648
00:47:20,316 --> 00:47:21,942
It's a 13-hour flight.

649
00:47:22,110 --> 00:47:24,986
Holidays are crumbs
to keep the proles happy.

650
00:47:25,154 --> 00:47:29,324
If the anarchists had won,
we wouldn't work at all.

651
00:47:29,492 --> 00:47:31,952
Is everything all right, dear?

652
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:35,247
Good. What are you doing
for Christmas?

653
00:47:36,999 --> 00:47:38,166
Well?

654
00:47:38,334 --> 00:47:40,168
She's spending it with friends.

655
00:47:40,336 --> 00:47:41,378
Be careful.

656
00:47:41,587 --> 00:47:43,672
So you need anything?

657
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:46,967
Have fun. Lots of love.

658
00:47:47,135 --> 00:47:49,970
Eat plenty of fruit and vegetables.

659
00:48:26,007 --> 00:48:28,550
- Is that any way to behave?
- What?

660
00:48:28,718 --> 00:48:31,803
- Is that how you eat?
- You all eat in front of the TV.

661
00:48:32,138 --> 00:48:35,015
Not from the pot.
It's disgusting!

662
00:48:35,683 --> 00:48:39,311
It's true what they say.
Iranians have no manners.

663
00:48:39,896 --> 00:48:43,231
Is it true that all nuns
were prostitutes first?

664
00:48:45,234 --> 00:48:48,111
That marked the start
of a series of moves...

665
00:48:48,279 --> 00:48:50,572
...from apartment to apartment.

666
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:53,366
First, Eve and her mother
took me in.

667
00:48:53,534 --> 00:48:56,036
Then I lived with 8 homosexuals.

668
00:48:56,204 --> 00:48:58,622
Then in a maid's room
on Floriangasse.

669
00:48:58,789 --> 00:49:01,333
Then with friends.
And friends' friends.

670
00:49:01,501 --> 00:49:05,253
I ended up at the home
of Frau Doktor Schloss.

671
00:49:05,588 --> 00:49:08,882
She was
a retired philosophy teacher.

672
00:49:09,091 --> 00:49:11,259
To be honest, she was crazy.

673
00:49:15,264 --> 00:49:17,974
The rent is 2,000 schillings.

674
00:49:18,142 --> 00:49:20,060
You like dogs, don't you?

675
00:49:20,228 --> 00:49:22,062
Yes, I love them.

676
00:49:23,689 --> 00:49:25,273
Yuki has adopted you.

677
00:49:25,775 --> 00:49:27,776
Dogs have a sixth sense.

678
00:49:27,944 --> 00:49:30,737
They can tell if people are kind.

679
00:49:34,116 --> 00:49:37,911
Over the next year,
I decided to fit in for real.

680
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:42,040
Certain aspects of Western culture
remained a mystery.

681
00:49:43,709 --> 00:49:45,460
I had to educate myself.

682
00:49:45,628 --> 00:49:48,505
From Sartre to Bakunin
to Zweig and Freud...

683
00:49:48,714 --> 00:49:50,423
...I read all I could.

684
00:49:50,967 --> 00:49:52,968
But I realized...

685
00:49:53,135 --> 00:49:55,303
...there were things
I'd never understand.

686
00:49:58,641 --> 00:50:01,977
Vienna 1986

687
00:50:02,728 --> 00:50:04,980
That bastard Waldheim got elected.

688
00:50:05,147 --> 00:50:07,482
- Yeah, it's crazy.
- Sickening.

689
00:50:07,650 --> 00:50:09,484
- I want to puke.
- It can't happen.

690
00:50:09,652 --> 00:50:11,653
There's a big protest tomorrow.

691
00:50:11,821 --> 00:50:13,905
That's all hot air anyway.

692
00:50:14,073 --> 00:50:17,450
Life is a void.
When man realizes that...

693
00:50:17,618 --> 00:50:20,495
...he can no longer live,
so he invents power games.

694
00:50:20,663 --> 00:50:23,707
Bullshit! Life isn't absurd!

695
00:50:23,874 --> 00:50:27,168
Some people
give their lives for freedom.

696
00:50:27,753 --> 00:50:29,963
You think my uncle died for fun?

697
00:50:30,548 --> 00:50:32,549
Egotistical prick.

698
00:50:35,636 --> 00:50:37,971
I was very confused.

699
00:50:38,848 --> 00:50:40,849
I had a safe, frivolous life...

700
00:50:41,017 --> 00:50:44,853
...while those I loved
knew the hell of war.

701
00:50:45,021 --> 00:50:48,773
However hard I tried,
I was haunted by guilt.

702
00:50:51,319 --> 00:50:55,322
I just wanted to live
like a girl my age.

703
00:50:55,489 --> 00:50:57,657
A big change was coming.

704
00:50:57,825 --> 00:51:00,744
In a few months,
I became a young lady.

705
00:51:00,911 --> 00:51:03,830
It was a time
of constantly renewed ugliness.

706
00:51:04,290 --> 00:51:07,125
First, I grew seven inches.

707
00:51:07,293 --> 00:51:09,544
Then my face became longer...

708
00:51:09,712 --> 00:51:12,631
...my right eye grew, then my chin.

709
00:51:12,798 --> 00:51:14,799
My right hand became huge...

710
00:51:14,967 --> 00:51:16,426
...then my left foot.

711
00:51:17,553 --> 00:51:21,139
My nose tripled in size.
My chest developed.

712
00:51:21,307 --> 00:51:24,434
My butt then restored
my center of gravity.

713
00:51:24,602 --> 00:51:28,855
To cap it all off, a huge beauty mark
decorated my nose.

714
00:51:39,575 --> 00:51:44,037
See, Yuki, I told you.
She's a prostitute.

715
00:51:47,458 --> 00:51:49,542
This music sucks.

716
00:51:49,710 --> 00:51:52,337
In any case, they're all losers here.

717
00:51:52,588 --> 00:51:56,925
Bakunin wanted bourgeois democrats
to adopt socialist resolutions.

718
00:51:58,094 --> 00:52:01,763
Things could have changed.
Capitalism undermines us.

719
00:52:01,931 --> 00:52:03,348
See what I mean?

720
00:52:03,516 --> 00:52:08,019
You're right. Where are you from?
Marie-Jeanne, right?

721
00:52:08,354 --> 00:52:11,564
Yeah, I'm from... I'm French.

722
00:52:11,732 --> 00:52:13,942
I'd never have guessed.

723
00:52:14,110 --> 00:52:15,735
I was in Paris. Know it?

724
00:52:15,903 --> 00:52:18,113
Sorry, I need to go see my friends.

725
00:52:18,406 --> 00:52:20,448
Okay, fine. See you.

726
00:52:38,467 --> 00:52:40,802
So you're French now?

727
00:52:40,970 --> 00:52:42,679
Grandma, stop it.

728
00:52:43,013 --> 00:52:45,140
I'm just asking.

729
00:52:45,307 --> 00:52:47,809
I didn't know you were French.

730
00:52:48,018 --> 00:52:50,812
Do you think
it is easy being Iranian here?

731
00:52:50,980 --> 00:52:53,690
If I say I am,
they treat me like a savage.

732
00:52:53,899 --> 00:52:57,527
They think we're all violent,
bloodthirsty fanatics.

733
00:52:58,112 --> 00:53:00,780
Is that any reason
to deny your roots?

734
00:53:04,827 --> 00:53:07,787
You remember what I told you?

735
00:53:07,955 --> 00:53:10,665
Be true to yourself.

736
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:20,759
Know what she told my brother?

737
00:53:20,926 --> 00:53:23,303
- She said she was French.
- No.

738
00:53:23,471 --> 00:53:25,346
- I swear.
- And he believed her?

739
00:53:25,514 --> 00:53:28,641
Have you seen her?
Who'd believe she's French?

740
00:53:30,644 --> 00:53:32,187
Was he hitting on her?

741
00:53:32,354 --> 00:53:36,316
Are you crazy? I'd kill myself
if he went out with...

742
00:53:36,484 --> 00:53:38,193
Shut up, you bitches!

743
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:41,571
Yes, I'm Iranian
and, yes, I'm proud of it!

744
00:53:44,158 --> 00:53:47,577
After three years in Austria,
I felt good at last.

745
00:53:47,745 --> 00:53:51,664
Momo, Thierry,
Eve and Olivier had left.

746
00:53:51,832 --> 00:53:53,958
I had new friends.

747
00:53:54,835 --> 00:53:58,546
Birgit was a hippie
who looked like an old child.

748
00:54:00,382 --> 00:54:02,342
At her house in the forest...

749
00:54:02,510 --> 00:54:04,886
...she threw anarchist parties.

750
00:54:05,054 --> 00:54:09,057
The state had nothing to fear
because these anarchists...

751
00:54:09,225 --> 00:54:12,602
...mainly drank beer
and ate sausages.

752
00:54:14,355 --> 00:54:17,232
At one of these parties,
I met Fernando.

753
00:54:17,399 --> 00:54:21,069
When I saw him,
I knew he was the man of my life.

754
00:54:50,432 --> 00:54:52,392
Marjane, are you there?

755
00:54:54,270 --> 00:54:56,771
Last night, thanks to you,
I finally understood.

756
00:54:57,273 --> 00:54:59,941
You've helped me discover myself.

757
00:55:00,901 --> 00:55:04,112
If it didn't work with you,
it won't with any girl.

758
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:07,407
I know now: I'm homosexual.

759
00:55:09,201 --> 00:55:11,619
It's so good to say it.

760
00:55:12,454 --> 00:55:14,873
Thank you, Marjane.

761
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:16,833
You're welcome.

762
00:55:19,086 --> 00:55:22,297
After that pathetic setback,
I swore off love.

763
00:55:22,464 --> 00:55:24,048
I swear off love.

764
00:55:24,884 --> 00:55:27,385
Love is a petty bourgeois emotion.

765
00:55:28,470 --> 00:55:32,140
But "life is life,"
as some losers used to sing.

766
00:55:32,349 --> 00:55:36,978
And, one November morning,
Markus came into my life.

767
00:55:49,950 --> 00:55:51,492
Want a ride home?

768
00:56:10,387 --> 00:56:12,221
I had finally found love.

769
00:56:12,389 --> 00:56:15,725
Nothing scared me
and the future seemed bright.

770
00:56:16,352 --> 00:56:19,354
Markus was going to be
a great writer.

771
00:56:21,023 --> 00:56:24,651
He'd read extracts of his play
to me in his room.

772
00:56:36,997 --> 00:56:39,374
We were one.

773
00:57:01,063 --> 00:57:02,730
I got croissants, baby!

774
00:57:06,235 --> 00:57:08,903
Wait, I can explain.
It's not what you think.

775
00:57:10,948 --> 00:57:13,408
Marjane, I love you!

776
00:57:13,951 --> 00:57:16,244
I love you!

777
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,875
I can't find my brooch.

778
00:57:23,043 --> 00:57:25,545
I'm sure you've stolen it.

779
00:57:25,963 --> 00:57:27,588
Not now. Leave me be.

780
00:57:27,756 --> 00:57:30,091
No! You won't get away with it...

781
00:57:30,259 --> 00:57:31,718
...you thief!

782
00:57:31,885 --> 00:57:34,053
Go to hell! I detest you!

783
00:57:34,221 --> 00:57:37,181
You and your shitty dog!

784
00:57:38,892 --> 00:57:42,103
How dare you say that about Yuki?
Where are you going?

785
00:57:42,980 --> 00:57:44,397
You won't get away!

786
00:57:44,565 --> 00:57:46,607
Go fuck yourself!

787
00:57:46,775 --> 00:57:49,402
You thief! Give me my brooch back!

788
00:57:49,570 --> 00:57:51,029
I'll call the police!

789
00:57:51,196 --> 00:57:53,114
Come back!

790
00:57:56,535 --> 00:57:58,411
What an idiot.

791
00:57:58,579 --> 00:58:00,788
That bastard fooled me.

792
00:58:01,707 --> 00:58:04,208
I'm an idiot.

793
00:58:04,376 --> 00:58:08,254
How did I fall in love
with that pathetic, stingy prick?

794
00:58:08,422 --> 00:58:10,381
- Want a ride home?
- Okay.

795
00:58:10,549 --> 00:58:13,926
I need to get gas.
Shall we split it?

796
00:58:15,637 --> 00:58:17,638
And his breath smelled like shit!

797
00:58:17,806 --> 00:58:20,224
The jerk had a lousy personality.

798
00:58:22,227 --> 00:58:25,396
Damn! Are you crazy?
My eye hurts!

799
00:58:25,564 --> 00:58:27,940
- Let me see, honey.
- It's okay!

800
00:58:28,108 --> 00:58:30,234
Pretentious loser. Writer, my ass!

801
00:58:30,402 --> 00:58:32,945
His rotten play
was a piece of shit.

802
00:58:35,908 --> 00:58:37,992
And he didn't have any balls.

803
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:41,120
He didn't stand up
to his mom for me.

804
00:58:46,668 --> 00:58:48,669
A real wimp.

805
00:58:48,837 --> 00:58:51,172
I always bought our hash too.

806
00:58:51,340 --> 00:58:54,342
That coward stayed in the car
waiting for me!

807
00:58:54,510 --> 00:58:56,969
He didn't care if I got arrested.

808
00:58:59,348 --> 00:59:02,850
What an idiot I was.
What an idiot...

809
00:59:11,819 --> 00:59:14,278
That was my first night
on the street.

810
00:59:14,446 --> 00:59:16,364
There were plenty more.

811
01:01:31,833 --> 01:01:35,544
A revolution had carried off
part of my family.

812
01:01:35,712 --> 01:01:37,797
I had survived a war...

813
01:01:38,632 --> 01:01:41,509
...but a banal love story
nearly killed me.

814
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:45,388
Are you okay?

815
01:01:47,599 --> 01:01:49,308
Are we awake now?

816
01:01:50,644 --> 01:01:53,271
You had a close call.

817
01:01:53,438 --> 01:01:56,190
You're lucky we found you
in that cold.

818
01:01:56,358 --> 01:01:58,150
You have bronchitis.

819
01:01:58,318 --> 01:02:02,363
I forbid you to smoke
a single cigarette.

820
01:02:02,531 --> 01:02:04,365
- Your last name?
- Satrapi.

821
01:02:04,533 --> 01:02:06,659
- First name?
- Marjane.

822
01:02:07,869 --> 01:02:09,996
- Where do you live?
- In Iran.

823
01:02:10,163 --> 01:02:12,039
In Iran?

824
01:02:12,541 --> 01:02:14,166
Can I make a phone call?

825
01:02:15,043 --> 01:02:16,877
- Hello?
- Dad?

826
01:02:17,045 --> 01:02:19,297
Marjane? Is that you?

827
01:02:19,464 --> 01:02:22,550
We were so worried.
No news in two months!

828
01:02:22,718 --> 01:02:25,344
Dad, can I come home?

829
01:02:25,512 --> 01:02:26,929
Of course.

830
01:02:27,097 --> 01:02:29,098
Promise me, no questions.

831
01:02:29,266 --> 01:02:30,891
I promise.

832
01:02:31,601 --> 01:02:33,352
Here's your mother.

833
01:02:34,062 --> 01:02:35,271
Marjane?

834
01:02:36,148 --> 01:02:37,648
Mom, don't cry, please.

835
01:02:37,816 --> 01:02:40,484
Come home, we're waiting for you.

836
01:02:40,652 --> 01:02:43,571
- Mom...
- No one will ask you anything.

837
01:02:43,780 --> 01:02:45,406
We promise.

838
01:02:54,583 --> 01:02:56,667
Any forbidden goods, sister?

839
01:02:56,835 --> 01:02:59,253
Pork, alcohol, playing cards, music...

840
01:02:59,421 --> 01:03:01,630
...films, fashion, porn?

841
01:03:01,798 --> 01:03:03,549
No, sir.

842
01:03:04,176 --> 01:03:05,593
Fix your veil.

843
01:03:06,178 --> 01:03:07,678
Yes, sir.

844
01:03:08,263 --> 01:03:10,264
You may go.

845
01:03:18,774 --> 01:03:21,817
Look! It's Marji!
My little girl...

846
01:03:21,985 --> 01:03:23,444
I didn't recognize you.

847
01:03:23,612 --> 01:03:25,279
- You're here.
- You've grown.

848
01:03:25,447 --> 01:03:27,406
You're here.

849
01:03:36,917 --> 01:03:40,628
The next day, I saw the mountains.
It had snowed.

850
01:03:40,796 --> 01:03:44,757
My father wondered if he needed
snow chains to go to work.

851
01:03:45,425 --> 01:03:49,303
We had breakfast together
as we used to.

852
01:03:49,763 --> 01:03:52,932
My mother made me
my favorite omelet.

853
01:03:53,308 --> 01:03:56,227
Nothing had changed
but, deep down, I knew...

854
01:03:56,395 --> 01:03:58,396
...nothing would be like before.

855
01:03:58,563 --> 01:04:00,981
We talked about this and that.

856
01:04:01,233 --> 01:04:04,985
They respected my wishes
and asked nothing about Vienna.

857
01:04:05,153 --> 01:04:09,990
I was anxious but also believed
that the nightmare was behind us.

858
01:04:11,076 --> 01:04:14,745
The future could be brighter
now that the war was over.

859
01:04:14,913 --> 01:04:17,540
The war is over. That's true.

860
01:04:17,707 --> 01:04:19,500
But now it's almost worse.

861
01:04:19,668 --> 01:04:22,503
People don't know
why we had a war.

862
01:04:22,671 --> 01:04:25,464
Let her breathe.
She just got back.

863
01:04:25,632 --> 01:04:27,842
It's all right, Mom.

864
01:04:31,012 --> 01:04:33,139
The West sold weapons
to both sides...

865
01:04:33,306 --> 01:04:37,184
...and we stupidly played
their cynical game.

866
01:04:37,769 --> 01:04:39,895
Eight years of war for nothing.

867
01:04:40,439 --> 01:04:43,023
A million dead for nothing.

868
01:04:44,151 --> 01:04:47,403
The last days were terrible.

869
01:04:47,571 --> 01:04:52,408
One month before the armistice,
Iraq bombed Tehran every day...

870
01:04:53,702 --> 01:04:56,328
...as if to wipe it off the map.

871
01:04:56,496 --> 01:04:59,331
Towards the end,
the regime got scared...

872
01:04:59,499 --> 01:05:03,836
...because an opposition army
had entered from Iraq.

873
01:05:04,004 --> 01:05:08,674
The government feared the threat
posed by political prisoners.

874
01:05:08,842 --> 01:05:12,928
The state adopted
a radical solution to the problem.

875
01:05:13,096 --> 01:05:15,306
It gave the prisoners a choice.

876
01:05:15,474 --> 01:05:17,558
Either they give up their ideas...

877
01:05:17,726 --> 01:05:20,561
...swear loyalty to the regime...

878
01:05:20,729 --> 01:05:23,147
...and do their time...

879
01:05:23,315 --> 01:05:25,441
...or they would be executed.

880
01:05:29,237 --> 01:05:32,406
The majority of them were executed.

881
01:05:42,250 --> 01:05:46,420
Now they name streets
after the war martyrs.

882
01:05:46,588 --> 01:05:50,090
That's all the families have left:
street names.

883
01:05:52,219 --> 01:05:57,473
Walking in Tehran now is like
walking through a cemetery.

884
01:06:14,783 --> 01:06:16,450
Lord, you've grown!

885
01:06:16,618 --> 01:06:19,078
You'll grab God's balls soon!

886
01:06:19,246 --> 01:06:21,121
Grandma!

887
01:06:21,957 --> 01:06:25,626
So tell me everything.
How was Vienna?

888
01:06:25,794 --> 01:06:28,379
Well, it was different...

889
01:06:29,589 --> 01:06:33,217
- Remember Mina?
- Sure, she's my cousin.

890
01:06:33,385 --> 01:06:36,053
She's married, with two kids.

891
01:06:37,097 --> 01:06:38,472
As dumb as ever.

892
01:06:39,015 --> 01:06:40,474
You remember Shila?

893
01:06:40,642 --> 01:06:42,434
- Yes.
- She's an ugly cow.

894
01:06:43,019 --> 01:06:46,647
Her face is so hairy.
She's like a gorilla.

895
01:06:46,815 --> 01:06:48,482
And you remember Modjeh?

896
01:06:48,650 --> 01:06:50,568
I remember everyone.

897
01:06:50,735 --> 01:06:53,487
She got divorced.
Apparently, he had a tiny dick.

898
01:06:53,655 --> 01:06:55,531
Or so Shari says.

899
01:06:55,699 --> 01:06:57,908
Well, she told Mehri who told me.

900
01:06:59,452 --> 01:07:01,161
You'll see them soon.

901
01:07:02,289 --> 01:07:04,290
- Oh, no.
- Yes.

902
01:07:10,672 --> 01:07:13,007
You must speak good German now.

903
01:07:13,174 --> 01:07:14,425
Yes, a little.

904
01:07:14,593 --> 01:07:17,052
I can say, "Ich liebe dich."

905
01:07:17,846 --> 01:07:22,516
Vienna reminds me of Empress Sissi.
Did you meet Romy Schneider?

906
01:07:23,852 --> 01:07:26,645
Marjane, stars shine in the sky...

907
01:07:26,813 --> 01:07:28,355
...and you shine in my heart.

908
01:07:30,025 --> 01:07:33,652
You look like a nun.
Who'd guess you were in Europe?

909
01:07:33,820 --> 01:07:34,862
You think so?

910
01:07:35,030 --> 01:07:37,364
You must have loads to tell us.

911
01:07:37,532 --> 01:07:38,949
Not really.

912
01:07:39,492 --> 01:07:42,119
How were the Vienna nightclubs?

913
01:07:42,287 --> 01:07:46,206
I didn't really go to nightclubs.
I don't like them.

914
01:07:46,374 --> 01:07:47,374
What?

915
01:07:47,584 --> 01:07:50,169
- Ever slept with a guy?
- Yes.

916
01:07:50,337 --> 01:07:52,463
- Is it good?
- It depends on the guy.

917
01:07:52,631 --> 01:07:55,507
What? You've slept
with more than one?

918
01:07:55,717 --> 01:07:57,718
Enroll in a prep class.

919
01:07:57,886 --> 01:07:59,386
Get your nose fixed.

920
01:07:59,554 --> 01:08:02,056
- Be an astronaut.
- Dress better.

921
01:08:19,240 --> 01:08:23,077
It's 90 degrees out there!
I'm sick of this thing!

922
01:08:23,244 --> 01:08:24,536
Damn hairdresser...

923
01:08:25,580 --> 01:08:27,247
...you're unworthy of my son.

924
01:08:27,749 --> 01:08:29,917
Hello, Anahita.

925
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:33,587
Marjane just went out.

926
01:08:33,755 --> 01:08:35,255
Okay, I'll tell her.

927
01:08:35,590 --> 01:08:36,882
Goodbye.

928
01:08:37,425 --> 01:08:39,843
You can't watch TV all day long.

929
01:08:40,011 --> 01:08:42,388
Didn't you want to take that exam?

930
01:08:44,683 --> 01:08:47,893
You're wasting
the best years of your life.

931
01:08:48,228 --> 01:08:50,729
See people. Get a change of scenery.

932
01:08:50,897 --> 01:08:52,106
They all piss me off.

933
01:08:52,273 --> 01:08:54,358
There must be someone you like.

934
01:08:54,526 --> 01:08:57,444
Just one among the 7 million here!

935
01:08:58,988 --> 01:09:02,449
Yes, there was Kia,
an old childhood friend.

936
01:09:03,535 --> 01:09:06,412
When I saw him,
I understood Grandma's words.

937
01:09:06,579 --> 01:09:07,955
He's nearly dead.

938
01:09:08,164 --> 01:09:09,957
Kia had been to war.

939
01:09:10,125 --> 01:09:13,127
He'd lost an arm and a leg.

940
01:09:13,294 --> 01:09:15,421
I had fun with him.

941
01:09:15,797 --> 01:09:19,758
We even laughed. I realized
my problems weren't that bad.

942
01:09:21,094 --> 01:09:25,639
His whole life is ruined
but he can still laugh.

943
01:09:27,100 --> 01:09:30,269
I suppose that's the only way
to deal with it.

944
01:09:31,813 --> 01:09:34,940
I keep telling myself that,
but I can't do it.

945
01:09:35,316 --> 01:09:37,025
It's unbearable.

946
01:09:37,193 --> 01:09:40,404
My life weighs down on me,
but who can I talk to?

947
01:09:40,572 --> 01:09:42,239
You understand?

948
01:09:43,450 --> 01:09:45,617
Everyone around me has suffered.

949
01:09:45,785 --> 01:09:49,997
I was a stranger in Austria
and now I'm one in my own country.

950
01:09:50,707 --> 01:09:55,419
Your condition has a name.
Depression.

951
01:09:56,254 --> 01:09:58,422
Effective treatment exists.

952
01:09:58,590 --> 01:10:01,008
I'll give you some pills.

953
01:10:16,149 --> 01:10:18,150
Sure you won't come with us?

954
01:10:19,235 --> 01:10:20,611
The sea air will help.

955
01:10:20,779 --> 01:10:24,448
No, I want to be alone.
Don't worry.

956
01:11:54,038 --> 01:11:56,081
Why are you here, my dear?

957
01:11:56,708 --> 01:11:58,250
Well, I'm dead.

958
01:11:58,418 --> 01:12:01,211
Don't you know
your time hasn't come?

959
01:12:01,713 --> 01:12:05,465
- It hasn't?
- You have to pull yourself together.

960
01:12:05,633 --> 01:12:07,634
Yes! He's right for once!

961
01:12:08,261 --> 01:12:10,721
You have a lot to do. Get moving!

962
01:12:14,976 --> 01:12:17,477
Go and do what you have to do.

963
01:12:20,565 --> 01:12:23,483
Remember,
the struggle continues! Right?

964
01:12:23,651 --> 01:12:25,986
Yeah, the struggle continues.

965
01:13:33,805 --> 01:13:37,099
Tehran 1992

966
01:13:41,396 --> 01:13:43,522
- I'm starving.
- Haven't you eaten?

967
01:13:43,690 --> 01:13:45,524
The idiot's on a diet.

968
01:13:45,692 --> 01:13:47,025
You're crazy.

969
01:13:47,193 --> 01:13:48,986
She got a copy of Vogue.

970
01:13:49,654 --> 01:13:52,489
She reads it all the time.

971
01:13:55,243 --> 01:13:57,327
You've caught his eye.

972
01:13:57,495 --> 01:13:58,870
You're embarrassing me.

973
01:13:59,706 --> 01:14:02,416
We'll now talk about Botticelli...

974
01:14:02,583 --> 01:14:05,585
...and, in particular,
The Birth of Venus.

975
01:14:06,212 --> 01:14:09,881
We could also call this painting
Spring...

976
01:14:10,049 --> 01:14:13,677
...like Botticelli's other allegory
in the Uffizi Gallery.

977
01:14:13,845 --> 01:14:15,053
In this painting...

978
01:14:15,221 --> 01:14:16,763
You there!

979
01:14:16,931 --> 01:14:18,765
What's so funny?

980
01:14:22,770 --> 01:14:25,105
Want to bet I'll take my veil off?

981
01:14:25,273 --> 01:14:27,441
- Sure.
- Come on, how much?

982
01:14:27,608 --> 01:14:28,942
Four hundred tomans.

983
01:14:29,861 --> 01:14:31,236
Go on.

984
01:14:41,456 --> 01:14:45,625
In the early 1990s,
the age of great ideals was over.

985
01:14:45,793 --> 01:14:50,881
After the Revolution,
so many students were imprisoned...

986
01:14:51,049 --> 01:14:53,091
...we didn't dare discuss politics.

987
01:14:54,510 --> 01:14:56,720
The war was behind us at last.

988
01:14:56,888 --> 01:15:01,016
We were so eager for happiness,
we forgot we weren't free.

989
01:16:01,577 --> 01:16:04,037
- Is that any way to dress?
- You hear me?

990
01:16:04,205 --> 01:16:05,247
Beat it!

991
01:16:13,798 --> 01:16:16,758
- Grandma, you're here?
- Yes, I came to see you.

992
01:16:19,137 --> 01:16:21,847
You're all dolled up!

993
01:16:22,557 --> 01:16:24,141
Are you in love?

994
01:16:24,308 --> 01:16:26,643
Yes, I was meeting him earlier.

995
01:16:26,811 --> 01:16:30,272
The Guardians turned up.
I had a close call.

996
01:16:31,357 --> 01:16:32,816
Look how I'm made up!

997
01:16:33,276 --> 01:16:34,818
I didn't know what to do.

998
01:16:34,986 --> 01:16:37,362
But a guy was staring at me.

999
01:16:37,530 --> 01:16:41,825
My only solution was to play
the poor, defenseless girl.

1000
01:16:42,577 --> 01:16:44,911
- Brother...
- Yes, sister.

1001
01:16:45,079 --> 01:16:47,038
A man just insulted me.

1002
01:16:47,206 --> 01:16:50,250
Where is the bastard?
We'll shut him up.

1003
01:16:50,418 --> 01:16:53,044
That's him on the steps there!

1004
01:16:53,212 --> 01:16:54,838
Shame on you.

1005
01:16:55,006 --> 01:16:58,508
Got a mother? A sister?
What if someone insulted them?

1006
01:17:00,845 --> 01:17:05,015
I didn't do anything!
I swear, on my mother's life!

1007
01:17:05,183 --> 01:17:08,393
- What did they do to him?
- They arrested him.

1008
01:17:08,561 --> 01:17:11,354
- You find that funny?
- Yes, don't you?

1009
01:17:11,522 --> 01:17:15,400
You're a selfish bitch,
that's what I think!

1010
01:17:19,989 --> 01:17:21,656
Grandma, I had no choice.

1011
01:17:21,824 --> 01:17:25,368
You had a choice!
Everyone has a choice!

1012
01:17:25,536 --> 01:17:28,038
Everyone always has a choice!

1013
01:17:29,540 --> 01:17:33,877
Your grandfather spent years in jail
for defending the innocent.

1014
01:17:34,295 --> 01:17:36,338
And your Uncle Anoush!

1015
01:17:36,505 --> 01:17:38,798
Have you forgotten why he died?

1016
01:17:39,967 --> 01:17:41,801
What have I taught you?

1017
01:17:42,428 --> 01:17:44,304
Integrity!

1018
01:17:45,181 --> 01:17:48,308
Does that word
mean anything to you?

1019
01:17:51,103 --> 01:17:52,395
Shame on you!

1020
01:18:00,404 --> 01:18:03,573
The lady with the shoulder bag,
stop running.

1021
01:18:03,866 --> 01:18:06,993
The lady with the bag,
stop running!

1022
01:18:07,161 --> 01:18:08,828
Hey, you, don't run!

1023
01:18:12,792 --> 01:18:14,459
Why are you running?

1024
01:18:14,627 --> 01:18:16,419
I'm late for my class!

1025
01:18:16,587 --> 01:18:18,672
Maybe, but you mustn't run.

1026
01:18:19,298 --> 01:18:23,468
When you run, your behind
moves in an obscene way.

1027
01:18:24,178 --> 01:18:26,221
So don't look at my ass!

1028
01:18:41,612 --> 01:18:44,906
This is crazy.
It's the same from every angle.

1029
01:18:45,199 --> 01:18:48,576
An anatomy class?
All you can see is her big nose.

1030
01:18:48,744 --> 01:18:50,287
You must all go...

1031
01:18:50,663 --> 01:18:52,914
...to the main campus immediately.

1032
01:18:53,249 --> 01:18:56,251
All absentees will be barred
for two weeks.

1033
01:19:00,256 --> 01:19:02,757
We simply cannot behave badly.

1034
01:19:02,925 --> 01:19:05,802
Our martyrs' blood
nourished our revolution.

1035
01:19:05,970 --> 01:19:10,682
Indecent behavior scorns those
who gave their lives for us.

1036
01:19:10,891 --> 01:19:13,560
And so I'd like
the young ladies here...

1037
01:19:13,728 --> 01:19:17,063
...to wear narrower trousers
and longer headscarves.

1038
01:19:17,231 --> 01:19:20,900
They should cover their hair
and not use make-up.

1039
01:19:21,068 --> 01:19:22,694
Any questions?

1040
01:19:22,862 --> 01:19:24,529
If not, the meeting is over.

1041
01:19:24,697 --> 01:19:25,822
Yes?

1042
01:19:25,990 --> 01:19:29,117
You talk about our scarves
and trousers...

1043
01:19:29,285 --> 01:19:31,411
...you say we use makeup, etc.

1044
01:19:31,579 --> 01:19:34,622
As an art student,
I'm often in the studio.

1045
01:19:34,790 --> 01:19:37,417
I need to move freely
in order to draw.

1046
01:19:37,585 --> 01:19:40,754
A longer scarf would hinder me.

1047
01:19:40,921 --> 01:19:45,842
You say our trousers are too wide
even though they hide our shape.

1048
01:19:46,010 --> 01:19:48,303
Since these trousers
are the fashion right now...

1049
01:19:48,471 --> 01:19:51,890
...is religion
defending our integrity...

1050
01:19:52,058 --> 01:19:54,434
...or is it opposed to fashion?

1051
01:19:55,102 --> 01:19:57,854
You criticize us,
yet our brothers here...

1052
01:19:58,022 --> 01:20:00,273
...have different hair and clothes.

1053
01:20:00,441 --> 01:20:03,902
Sometimes we can even make out
their underwear.

1054
01:20:04,070 --> 01:20:06,363
Why, as a woman...

1055
01:20:06,530 --> 01:20:09,699
...should their tight clothes
have no effect on me...

1056
01:20:09,867 --> 01:20:12,619
...while a shorter headscarf
arouses them?

1057
01:20:16,040 --> 01:20:20,168
Good girl. That's like chopping
their tiny dicks off.

1058
01:20:21,337 --> 01:20:25,423
Take that hood off.
It makes me claustrophobic.

1059
01:20:25,591 --> 01:20:27,801
I forget I'm wearing it.

1060
01:20:29,720 --> 01:20:31,346
Never forget that.

1061
01:20:31,514 --> 01:20:35,058
Fear lulls our minds to sleep.

1062
01:20:35,267 --> 01:20:37,977
It turns us into cowards as well.

1063
01:20:38,604 --> 01:20:42,023
You showed guts. I'm proud of you.

1064
01:20:45,569 --> 01:20:47,153
- I want to leave.
- To go where?

1065
01:20:47,321 --> 01:20:49,697
Who cares. The USA or Europe.

1066
01:20:49,865 --> 01:20:51,282
Where in Europe?

1067
01:20:51,450 --> 01:20:53,284
Anywhere. I'm sick of Iran.

1068
01:20:53,786 --> 01:20:56,079
- What about us?
- You'll come too.

1069
01:20:56,247 --> 01:20:58,498
I don't want to leave.

1070
01:20:58,791 --> 01:21:00,708
You're still nostalgic.

1071
01:21:00,876 --> 01:21:03,586
You'll soon be sick
of people's meddling.

1072
01:21:04,130 --> 01:21:07,173
Maybe, but in the West nobody cares
if you die on the street.

1073
01:21:08,342 --> 01:21:10,135
Don't worry.

1074
01:21:11,178 --> 01:21:12,846
We'll manage somehow.

1075
01:21:18,853 --> 01:21:21,521
What's your relationship
with this man?

1076
01:21:22,815 --> 01:21:24,149
You know what happens now.

1077
01:21:24,316 --> 01:21:27,944
We call your parents.
They pay a fine or you get whipped.

1078
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:42,500
When your mother and I were 15,
we'd walk hand in hand.

1079
01:21:45,045 --> 01:21:47,338
It was in this same country.

1080
01:21:50,801 --> 01:21:55,305
This is the way things are now,
my daughter.

1081
01:21:55,556 --> 01:21:58,016
You must be careful from now on.

1082
01:21:58,184 --> 01:22:01,686
You should avoid
being together in public.

1083
01:22:13,407 --> 01:22:15,909
It's impossible.
We can't go anywhere.

1084
01:22:16,076 --> 01:22:19,537
We're like prisoners.
What kind of life is this?

1085
01:22:19,705 --> 01:22:20,747
Yeah.

1086
01:22:21,540 --> 01:22:23,166
We should get married.

1087
01:22:24,460 --> 01:22:25,919
Well?

1088
01:22:50,736 --> 01:22:52,820
- Have you been crying, Mom?
- No.

1089
01:22:56,450 --> 01:23:00,453
I wanted you to be independent,
educated, cultured.

1090
01:23:00,621 --> 01:23:02,664
Now you're marrying at 21!

1091
01:23:03,374 --> 01:23:07,293
I want you to leave Iran,
to be free and emancipated!

1092
01:23:07,545 --> 01:23:11,381
Mom, trust me.
I know what I'm doing.

1093
01:23:11,549 --> 01:23:14,509
One year later

1094
01:23:22,685 --> 01:23:24,477
- Seen my car keys?
- Huh?

1095
01:23:24,645 --> 01:23:26,479
My car keys!

1096
01:23:26,647 --> 01:23:28,982
- I left them on the table.
- No idea.

1097
01:23:32,486 --> 01:23:34,862
They were just there.

1098
01:23:56,260 --> 01:23:58,595
- We share nothing.
- You're a great match.

1099
01:23:58,762 --> 01:24:00,471
The perfect couple.

1100
01:24:00,639 --> 01:24:02,015
Perfect, my ass!

1101
01:24:02,683 --> 01:24:04,434
Do you want my photo?

1102
01:24:06,437 --> 01:24:07,687
Jerk!

1103
01:24:07,855 --> 01:24:10,857
You used to say
how much in love you were.

1104
01:24:11,025 --> 01:24:13,901
It's easy to be in love
three hours a week.

1105
01:24:14,069 --> 01:24:16,279
Not when you share the same home.

1106
01:24:16,447 --> 01:24:19,324
Surely you're not getting divorced?

1107
01:24:20,534 --> 01:24:22,035
I don't know.

1108
01:24:22,202 --> 01:24:25,038
My sister left her husband
last year.

1109
01:24:26,457 --> 01:24:28,791
As soon as she was divorced...

1110
01:24:28,959 --> 01:24:31,961
...every man around
wanted to sleep with her.

1111
01:24:32,129 --> 01:24:34,047
The butcher made advances.

1112
01:24:34,214 --> 01:24:35,882
Then the baker too.

1113
01:24:36,050 --> 01:24:37,383
The grocer.

1114
01:24:37,551 --> 01:24:39,510
And even beggars!

1115
01:24:40,304 --> 01:24:43,681
Men all think their thing
is irresistible...

1116
01:24:43,849 --> 01:24:47,894
...and that a divorce won't refuse
since she's not a virgin.

1117
01:24:50,731 --> 01:24:53,024
If life isn't hell,
stay with him.

1118
01:25:04,745 --> 01:25:06,788
What's got you in such a state?

1119
01:25:06,955 --> 01:25:08,039
Forgive me.

1120
01:25:08,248 --> 01:25:11,125
Of course.
But what has made you so sad?

1121
01:25:11,627 --> 01:25:14,504
Grandma. It's terrible.

1122
01:25:14,672 --> 01:25:16,756
What's so terrible?

1123
01:25:16,924 --> 01:25:20,176
I don't love Reza anymore.

1124
01:25:20,344 --> 01:25:22,679
I think we're going to separate.

1125
01:25:24,098 --> 01:25:28,267
So that's all it is?
I thought someone had died.

1126
01:25:28,894 --> 01:25:30,937
You're out of your mind.

1127
01:25:31,105 --> 01:25:34,524
You do this to me,
with my weak heart!

1128
01:25:34,692 --> 01:25:38,611
All these tears over a divorce!

1129
01:25:43,701 --> 01:25:45,284
Listen to me.

1130
01:25:45,619 --> 01:25:48,287
I did it 55 years ago...

1131
01:25:48,455 --> 01:25:51,708
...and no one got divorced
back then.

1132
01:25:51,875 --> 01:25:55,712
I knew I'd be happier alone
than with some jerk.

1133
01:25:55,879 --> 01:25:58,047
- But...
- There's no "but."

1134
01:25:58,424 --> 01:26:01,300
The first marriage is practice
for the second.

1135
01:26:01,468 --> 01:26:04,929
You'll be happier next time round.

1136
01:26:10,185 --> 01:26:12,979
You're crying
because you were wrong.

1137
01:26:13,147 --> 01:26:16,482
It's hard
admitting your mistakes, hmm?

1138
01:29:02,190 --> 01:29:04,108
Where were you?

1139
01:29:04,276 --> 01:29:05,943
Why didn't you call?

1140
01:29:07,446 --> 01:29:11,032
- Nima is dead.
- What?

1141
01:29:11,575 --> 01:29:13,784
Nima is dead.

1142
01:29:16,997 --> 01:29:18,164
I'm leaving you.

1143
01:29:22,502 --> 01:29:24,837
It was time for me to leave.

1144
01:29:25,005 --> 01:29:27,298
I decided to go to France.

1145
01:29:27,466 --> 01:29:31,093
I had to wait three months
for a visa.

1146
01:29:32,596 --> 01:29:35,556
I went to the Caspian Sea
with my Grandma...

1147
01:29:35,724 --> 01:29:39,018
...to fill my lungs
with its special air.

1148
01:29:40,646 --> 01:29:43,397
An air you find nowhere else.

1149
01:29:52,866 --> 01:29:57,370
I promised my grandfather
I'd make him proud.

1150
01:30:03,043 --> 01:30:07,004
Finally, I went to the prison
where Uncle Anoush lay...

1151
01:30:07,172 --> 01:30:10,341
...somewhere among thousands
of other innocents.

1152
01:30:10,509 --> 01:30:14,220
I swore to him to remain
as honest as possible.

1153
01:30:29,569 --> 01:30:31,654
Then came the day I left.

1154
01:30:32,572 --> 01:30:34,782
My father cried as usual.

1155
01:30:39,454 --> 01:30:41,747
You're going for good. You're free.

1156
01:30:41,915 --> 01:30:43,958
Today's Iran is not for you.

1157
01:30:44,126 --> 01:30:45,918
I forbid you to come back.

1158
01:30:46,086 --> 01:30:47,753
Yes, Mom.

1159
01:30:47,921 --> 01:30:51,465
- Grandma...
- My little girl.

1160
01:31:11,445 --> 01:31:14,155
I never saw my grandmother again.

1161
01:31:15,574 --> 01:31:17,491
She died shortly thereafter.

1162
01:31:18,869 --> 01:31:21,120
Freedom always has a price.

1163
01:32:08,210 --> 01:32:09,668
Terrible weather.

1164
01:32:12,172 --> 01:32:13,798
Where are you coming from?

1165
01:32:16,009 --> 01:32:17,384
Iran.

1166
01:32:20,013 --> 01:32:23,599
Grandma, you smell so good.
How do you do it?

1167
01:32:23,767 --> 01:32:26,852
I pick jasmine flowers
every morning.

1168
01:32:27,020 --> 01:32:29,980
When I dress,
I slip them inside my bra.

1169
01:32:30,190 --> 01:32:32,817
That way, I always smell good.

1170
01:32:32,984 --> 01:32:35,820
Wow! That's great!
