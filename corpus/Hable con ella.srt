1
00:00:33,001 --> 00:00:38,155
TALK TO HER

2
00:03:26,201 --> 00:03:29,511
The stage is full of wooden
chairs and tables.

3
00:03:30,561 --> 00:03:33,917
Two women come out with robes.

4
00:03:34,361 --> 00:03:37,876
Their eyes are closed.
Like two sleepwalkers.

5
00:03:38,361 --> 00:03:42,434
You get scared...They trip
on everything, poor them.

6
00:03:42,761 --> 00:03:46,276
But suddenly, a man appears.

7
00:03:46,721 --> 00:03:51,192
With a very sad face, the
saddest I have ever seen.

8
00:03:51,681 --> 00:03:55,310
He pushes tables and chairs
out of their way.

9
00:03:57,201 --> 00:04:00,238
You can't imagine how touching
it was.

10
00:04:01,681 --> 00:04:05,276
Someone was sitting next to me.
In his 40s, hundsome.

11
00:04:06,361 --> 00:04:09,671
He cried with emotion, 
lots of times.

12
00:04:09,961 --> 00:04:13,840
I don't understand why...
It was very beautiful!

13
00:04:15,401 --> 00:04:17,517
I have a surprise for you!

14
00:04:25,401 --> 00:04:28,677
I have an autograph of
Rina Baus for you.

15
00:04:28,961 --> 00:04:31,429
I had to buy the photo.

16
00:04:33,801 --> 00:04:36,161
It is in english and says:

17
00:04:36,161 --> 00:04:39,517
I hope you surpass all
the obstacles...

18
00:04:39,961 --> 00:04:42,316
... and start dancing.

19
00:05:07,001 --> 00:05:09,754
-She has her period.
-It's early.

20
00:06:18,121 --> 00:06:19,873
Good evening.

21
00:06:25,761 --> 00:06:28,434
Benigno, can you
stay tonight?

22
00:06:28,761 --> 00:06:32,037
My sister can't,
and I don't have anyone else.

23
00:06:32,281 --> 00:06:35,114
Why did you come?
You should have called.

24
00:06:35,201 --> 00:06:38,716
I am not taking advantage of you.
This week you did 3 nights.

25
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:42,829
Don't worry. A free afternoon
is enough for me.

26
00:06:43,121 --> 00:06:46,636
I have to see the house
workers. It's a mess.

27
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:50,961
And to frame a photo.

28
00:06:50,961 --> 00:06:55,273
My condition is not improving.
The hospital will decide.

29
00:06:55,761 --> 00:06:58,753
Your husband left you
and the children.

30
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:02,630
Just come the nights you can.
We will be ok.

31
00:07:05,321 --> 00:07:07,312
Thanks a lot.

32
00:07:08,521 --> 00:07:11,877
-You cut off the intestinal food.
-She couldn't take it.

33
00:07:12,121 --> 00:07:15,272
-We will try again tomorrow.
-Yes, go now.

34
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:18,472
And keep the spirits up!

35
00:07:25,521 --> 00:07:30,197
Six bulls and a woman.
Wednesday at Briuega.

36
00:07:31,361 --> 00:07:34,990
Lydia P Gonzales will
fight six bulls.

37
00:07:36,801 --> 00:07:39,474
Why such a drastic decision?

38
00:07:39,601 --> 00:07:43,116
It's my job. 2 bulls, or 6.
Whatever they say.

39
00:07:43,521 --> 00:07:46,761
People say a lot of bullfighters 
won't fight with you...

40
00:07:46,761 --> 00:07:48,681
...because you are a woman.

41
00:07:48,681 --> 00:07:51,320
People can say what they want.

42
00:07:51,641 --> 00:07:55,031
Too much chauvinism in bullfighting,
but there are exceptions.

43
00:07:55,441 --> 00:08:00,196
Nino Valencia was happy to share
billing with you for several months.

44
00:08:03,161 --> 00:08:06,119
Do you think he did it
to promote himself?

45
00:08:06,481 --> 00:08:08,711
And when he succeeded that,
he abandoned you?

46
00:08:09,001 --> 00:08:11,913
I told you, I don't want
to talk about this!

47
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:15,481
But by talking about
certain problems...

48
00:08:15,481 --> 00:08:18,001
...is the first step
towards their solution.

49
00:08:18,001 --> 00:08:20,595
-Nino Valencia...
-Enough!

50
00:08:20,961 --> 00:08:24,921
My dear Lydia, let me
finish the question.

51
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:28,152
I am not discussing this.
I told you earlier.

52
00:08:28,281 --> 00:08:32,521
You didn't say anything earlier!
It's bad what you are saying!

53
00:08:32,521 --> 00:08:35,601
They will think
it's a fixed interview.

54
00:08:35,601 --> 00:08:39,389
And I am on of the few who
dare say the truth...

55
00:08:39,601 --> 00:08:42,561
...and you should dare accept

56
00:08:42,561 --> 00:08:45,758
...that Nino Valencia
took advantage of you.

57
00:08:46,161 --> 00:08:50,641
He shared with you not only
the fame, but sex as well.

58
00:08:50,641 --> 00:08:54,077
And he left you when
time was right.

59
00:08:55,441 --> 00:08:58,478
Juan Luis, Marco here...
How are you?

60
00:08:59,081 --> 00:09:01,231
I want to ask you something.

61
00:09:01,921 --> 00:09:05,357
I would like to do an article
about Lydia Gonzales.

62
00:09:06,281 --> 00:09:08,476
Yes, I see it too...

63
00:09:11,121 --> 00:09:13,874
I would like to do something
          deep.

64
00:09:15,801 --> 00:09:18,952
For the Sunday issue?
Great...

65
00:10:12,921 --> 00:10:16,800
-The woman has gone crazy!
-She dedicates it to you.

66
00:10:17,201 --> 00:10:20,876
She would let the bull injur
her, just so that you see it.

67
00:10:21,401 --> 00:10:24,393
You shouldn't have come,
especially you.

68
00:11:13,321 --> 00:11:16,313
Don't tell me anything.
I know what I am doing.

69
00:11:16,761 --> 00:11:20,674
Nino should concentrate.
He doesn't want any more worries.

70
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:24,920
Nothing to worry about. He should
just come to pick up his stuff.

71
00:11:25,641 --> 00:11:29,121
-Or tell me where to send them.
-Send them at my place.

72
00:11:29,121 --> 00:11:33,080
He, himself, should say so.
This is nothing to do with you.

73
00:11:35,521 --> 00:11:37,910
You can leave whenever you want.

74
00:11:38,241 --> 00:11:41,001
-Good evening.
-Scotch on the rocks, please.

75
00:11:41,001 --> 00:11:44,232
-What glass do you prefer?
-A tall one.

76
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:51,833
Can I talk to you for
a minute, please?

77
00:11:53,521 --> 00:11:56,672
Forget it. When something is
over, it's over.

78
00:11:58,201 --> 00:12:01,830
-What are you saying?
-Can I talk to you?

79
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:08,121
If you take me to Madrid,
we can talk on the way.

80
00:12:08,121 --> 00:12:10,237
It will be my pleasure.

81
00:12:22,921 --> 00:12:26,152
-Who named you Lydia;
-My father.

82
00:12:26,401 --> 00:12:29,518
It's as if he sealed your destiny.

83
00:12:29,641 --> 00:12:33,919
He always wanted to be a bullfighter,
but stayed a banderillero.

84
00:12:34,641 --> 00:12:38,316
He is the one that was there 
for me, more than anyone else.

85
00:12:38,761 --> 00:12:41,070
But he died last year.

86
00:12:42,321 --> 00:12:44,312
I am sorry.

87
00:12:44,921 --> 00:12:48,311
'El Pais' wants me to do a profile
on you for their Sunday issue.

88
00:12:48,561 --> 00:12:51,917
Do you write on bullfighting?
I don't know your name.

89
00:12:52,121 --> 00:12:55,318
To be honest,
I know nothing of it.

90
00:12:56,521 --> 00:13:00,196
But I know a lot about
desperate women.

91
00:13:00,601 --> 00:13:03,877
And who told you I am
desperate?

92
00:13:04,201 --> 00:13:07,641
-This is the impression I have.
-Bullfighting doesn't interest you.

93
00:13:07,641 --> 00:13:10,713
You are interested in my
relationship with Nino Valencia.

94
00:13:10,961 --> 00:13:14,033
Tell EI Pais to leave me alone!

95
00:13:51,801 --> 00:13:54,361
-Take me from here!
-What's going on?

96
00:13:54,441 --> 00:13:58,116
Take me from here! There is
a snake in the kitchen.

97
00:13:58,401 --> 00:14:01,473
-Give me the keys.
-The door is open.

98
00:14:01,721 --> 00:14:03,951
Calm down.
And stay there.

99
00:15:34,121 --> 00:15:36,112
My purse.

100
00:15:37,961 --> 00:15:40,395
Take me to a hotel.

101
00:15:40,761 --> 00:15:43,434
I am never coming back to
this house.

102
00:15:44,161 --> 00:15:47,790
-To which hotel?
-To Eurobuilding, lets say.

103
00:16:16,401 --> 00:16:19,598
Don't tell anyone about
the snake, please.

104
00:16:20,481 --> 00:16:23,120
Only my family knows.

105
00:16:23,241 --> 00:16:26,472
I always respect other
people's phobias.

106
00:16:26,841 --> 00:16:30,959
After what you have done, how
can I say no to to the profile?

107
00:16:31,721 --> 00:16:35,680
Think about it again. I will
call tomorrow, tell me then.

108
00:16:36,481 --> 00:16:38,756
Thanks for everything.

109
00:17:01,001 --> 00:17:04,789
Do you want me to stay? I can
sleep in the sofa.

110
00:17:05,001 --> 00:17:08,152
No, I need to get used to
being alone.

111
00:17:49,081 --> 00:17:50,958
Do you wash her?

112
00:17:51,241 --> 00:17:53,118
What do you think?

113
00:17:53,801 --> 00:17:56,440
-How was the night?
-normal.

114
00:17:56,841 --> 00:18:00,390
-Give it to me. I will do it.
-I am going now.

115
00:18:00,601 --> 00:18:02,876
-Good bye.
-Bye, Matilde.

116
00:18:06,241 --> 00:18:08,232
It's so hot!

117
00:18:08,681 --> 00:18:12,230
-Lets cut her hair.
-short, it's more practical.

118
00:18:13,161 --> 00:18:16,198
We will leave it as it was
when she came here...

119
00:18:16,481 --> 00:18:19,361
...so that she is not surprised
when she wakes up.

120
00:18:19,361 --> 00:18:22,353
After 4 years, it will be great.

121
00:18:22,441 --> 00:18:24,921
I believe in miracles.
So should you.

122
00:18:24,921 --> 00:18:27,913
-Why me?
-Because you need them.

123
00:18:28,161 --> 00:18:32,200
One might happen to you,
and you will not know.

124
00:18:32,921 --> 00:18:34,957
So hot!

125
00:18:35,201 --> 00:18:37,281
I took something from the 
    drugstore...

126
00:18:37,281 --> 00:18:40,273
...to help stop the perspiration
stains on my uniform.

127
00:18:40,681 --> 00:18:44,121
My armpits are ok,
but look at my face.

128
00:18:44,121 --> 00:18:46,476
-What's it called?
-Perspirex.

129
00:18:54,881 --> 00:18:57,349
It's Marco...
Remember me?

130
00:18:58,121 --> 00:19:00,555
-How are you?
-Naked.

131
00:19:05,801 --> 00:19:08,679
I need to buy some clothes.
That's all I've got.

132
00:19:09,161 --> 00:19:11,629
I can bring you some
from your place.

133
00:19:12,001 --> 00:19:15,073
I don't want anything from there.
Maybe another time.

134
00:19:15,401 --> 00:19:17,517
-Where are we going?
-To Sybilla.

135
00:19:17,761 --> 00:19:20,229
-You think I am crazy.
-Why?

136
00:19:20,481 --> 00:19:23,951
-Because I don't want to go home.
-No, I understand.

137
00:19:24,401 --> 00:19:28,519
When I separated, I couldn't
sleep in the same bed...

138
00:19:28,881 --> 00:19:31,918
I was sleeping in the sofa,
in the living room.

139
00:19:32,121 --> 00:19:36,319
For a week. Until I finally
bought a new bed.

140
00:19:36,721 --> 00:19:38,837
So, you are separated.

141
00:19:39,601 --> 00:19:41,478
I am alone.

142
00:19:42,401 --> 00:19:46,030
AFTER A FEW MONTHS

143
00:20:03,201 --> 00:20:05,874
Marco, we should
talk afterwards.

144
00:20:06,201 --> 00:20:09,671
-We've been talking for an hour.
-You have, not me.

145
00:20:10,681 --> 00:20:12,592
Indeed.

146
00:20:40,161 --> 00:20:44,552
Did you read about the nuns
that got raped by the misionaries?

147
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:49,915
Priests, themselves!
It's horrible!

148
00:20:50,401 --> 00:20:53,281
Yeah, they've gone bad too!
Where are we heading to?

149
00:20:53,281 --> 00:20:55,795
First they raped the locals.

150
00:20:56,201 --> 00:20:59,511
Then, due to AIDS, they started 
raping nuns.

151
00:21:00,401 --> 00:21:03,074
And I admired them so much!

152
00:21:03,401 --> 00:21:06,040
Not all of them are rapists,
for sure.

153
00:21:06,361 --> 00:21:09,114
No, some of them are
   pedophiles.

154
00:21:09,441 --> 00:21:13,116
-What's that? Everyone loves fucking.
-Antonio, you are an animal!

155
00:21:14,881 --> 00:21:17,873
-How do the bulls look?
-Good, but fat.

156
00:21:18,321 --> 00:21:21,438
-How much do you think?
-Over 500 kilos.

157
00:21:22,201 --> 00:21:25,910
I am going to the bar. And don't
forget, we are eating home.

158
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:29,511
If the kids don't see their aunt,
there'll be hell to pay.

159
00:24:41,921 --> 00:24:44,594
Don't cry, my love.

160
00:24:54,121 --> 00:24:57,001
-How is it?
-Very bad.

161
00:24:57,001 --> 00:24:58,798
It tore her apart.

162
00:24:58,881 --> 00:25:01,401
The father will be happy now!

163
00:25:01,401 --> 00:25:05,599
'Not the little one!', we kept
telling him, my mother and I.

164
00:25:08,041 --> 00:25:10,841
And yet, she became like him.

165
00:25:10,841 --> 00:25:13,071
Don't be upset.

166
00:25:14,001 --> 00:25:16,117
What time is it?

167
00:25:16,361 --> 00:25:18,431
It has been four hours.

168
00:25:19,761 --> 00:25:22,594
AFTER THREE WEEKS

169
00:25:23,921 --> 00:25:26,041
Are you going to Cordoba?

170
00:25:26,041 --> 00:25:29,670
Yes...I would like to stay,
but I can't.

171
00:25:29,761 --> 00:25:33,197
We can't do anything extra.

172
00:25:33,321 --> 00:25:35,721
The bar's been closed for 20 days.

173
00:25:35,721 --> 00:25:39,157
The kids are with the neigbhour,
and I've neglected the other one.

174
00:25:39,441 --> 00:25:42,831
If something happens, can
you be here in 2 hours?

175
00:25:43,281 --> 00:25:47,274
-Rest assured for that.
-We have to have faith.

176
00:25:49,321 --> 00:25:51,961
I light some candles...

177
00:25:51,961 --> 00:25:54,873
...but I find it very
difficult to have faith.

178
00:25:55,561 --> 00:25:58,678
When can we put her medals
back on her?

179
00:25:59,681 --> 00:26:01,561
Not yet.

180
00:26:01,561 --> 00:26:05,679
With all these...
wounds, the tracheotomy...

181
00:26:08,601 --> 00:26:10,796
She never took them off.

182
00:26:24,441 --> 00:26:26,477
I will get a vase.

183
00:26:45,481 --> 00:26:48,598
I have to go to the US
for three months.

184
00:26:49,081 --> 00:26:52,153
It is very important,
says my agent.

185
00:26:52,481 --> 00:26:56,360
And yet...the way things
stand here...

186
00:26:59,161 --> 00:27:01,595
...I don't want to go.

187
00:27:14,241 --> 00:27:17,313
Can you get out for
a moment, please?

188
00:27:26,441 --> 00:27:29,433
No smoking here.

189
00:27:31,921 --> 00:27:34,116
Did she talk to you that day?

190
00:27:35,881 --> 00:27:39,191
-Or rather, I talked.
-And what did you say?

191
00:27:40,521 --> 00:27:42,591
Things that concern me.

192
00:27:43,361 --> 00:27:46,241
Did she tell you anything 
about me?

193
00:27:46,241 --> 00:27:50,200
Honestly, Lydia hadn't talked 
about you for a long time.

194
00:27:51,041 --> 00:27:55,398
-It's my fault for what happened.
-No, it's my fault.

195
00:31:52,601 --> 00:31:55,638
Caetano made me
freak out.

196
00:31:58,881 --> 00:32:02,396
Marco, I've always wanted
to ask you something.

197
00:32:02,641 --> 00:32:06,316
Why did you cry that night,
after you killed the snake?

198
00:32:08,041 --> 00:32:10,430
It brought me lots of memories.

199
00:32:12,121 --> 00:32:15,591
Years ago, I had to
kill another snake.

200
00:32:15,961 --> 00:32:18,077
We were in Africa.

201
00:32:18,521 --> 00:32:21,521
She had the same phobia as you.

202
00:32:21,521 --> 00:32:26,549
She was waiting outside the tent,
terrified, defenseless...

203
00:32:27,881 --> 00:32:30,111
...and totally naked...

204
00:32:31,761 --> 00:32:35,037
...because she had seen the snake,
while we were asleep.

205
00:32:35,401 --> 00:32:38,552
Was it the same one who made
you sleep in the living room?

206
00:32:40,881 --> 00:32:43,236
I hate that woman.

207
00:32:43,681 --> 00:32:47,201
-I haven't seen her for years.
-Even worse.

208
00:32:47,201 --> 00:32:50,193
What can I do to make you
forget her? 

209
00:32:50,401 --> 00:32:52,756
Exactly what you are doing now.

210
00:33:22,321 --> 00:33:26,075
You were sound asleep. We didn't
want to wake you up.

211
00:33:27,961 --> 00:33:31,556
-Is Dr Vega here?
-He is in his office.

212
00:34:11,921 --> 00:34:14,993
Rosa, close the door.
There's a draft.

213
00:34:15,761 --> 00:34:18,878
-She opened her eyes.
-That gives me the creeps!

214
00:34:19,161 --> 00:34:22,198
-And when she yawns?
-I shit myself!

215
00:34:24,041 --> 00:34:27,158
Good morning, doctor.
I want to talk to you.

216
00:34:27,721 --> 00:34:29,996
How are you? Did you sleep well?

217
00:34:30,921 --> 00:34:32,513
I will buy you coffee.

218
00:34:34,161 --> 00:34:37,392
How long for might Lydia
stay like that?

219
00:34:37,641 --> 00:34:41,350
Months... years...
maybe for the rest of her life...

220
00:34:42,281 --> 00:34:44,636
There is no hope?

221
00:34:46,041 --> 00:34:49,477
As a doctor, I have to say
no... However...

222
00:34:49,761 --> 00:34:51,752
RESUSCITATION

223
00:34:52,121 --> 00:34:55,477
Meryl Moon wakes up after
15 years in a coma.

224
00:34:55,801 --> 00:34:58,921
She went into a coma during 
childbirth.

225
00:34:58,921 --> 00:35:03,233
Meryl was a PVS, persistent 
vegetative state, like Lydia, for life.

226
00:35:04,041 --> 00:35:07,201
Her recovery contradicts
everything I am about to say.

227
00:35:07,201 --> 00:35:09,157
That is, that there is hope.

228
00:35:09,521 --> 00:35:11,921
I insist. Scientifically, no.

229
00:35:11,921 --> 00:35:15,072
But if you want to have faith, 
           OK.

230
00:35:15,361 --> 00:35:18,681
Is she opening her eyes?
Or I imagine this?

231
00:35:18,681 --> 00:35:23,118
She does, but that doesn't mean
she is aware of anything.

232
00:35:23,601 --> 00:35:27,514
Her brain cell has been 
completely destroyed.

233
00:35:28,001 --> 00:35:32,631
However, it can control
the automatic functions...

234
00:35:33,001 --> 00:35:37,401
such as breathing, sleeping,
waking up and intestinal functions.

235
00:35:37,401 --> 00:35:40,201
She opens her eyes,
but mechanically.

236
00:35:40,201 --> 00:35:43,477
Her brain is dead. She has
no ideas and feelings.

237
00:35:57,801 --> 00:36:00,190
Come in, please.

238
00:36:11,481 --> 00:36:14,473
-My name is Benigno.
-Marco Zuloaga

239
00:36:14,641 --> 00:36:16,711
This is Alicia.

240
00:36:21,481 --> 00:36:23,881
Was it your first night here?

241
00:36:23,881 --> 00:36:26,841
The first one is the worst.
Then you get used to it.

242
00:36:26,841 --> 00:36:28,881
Why these boots?

243
00:36:28,881 --> 00:36:32,271
They prevent her feet from
twisting or falling.

244
00:36:32,721 --> 00:36:36,839
-They look like 'Ibiza' boots.
-I've never been to Ibiza.

245
00:36:37,201 --> 00:36:40,477
-I know you.
-From my books?

246
00:36:42,001 --> 00:36:46,040
It was in Cafe Muller...
We happened to be sitting together.

247
00:36:48,361 --> 00:36:52,354
And at some stage,
you started crying.

248
00:36:54,721 --> 00:36:58,839
I told you about him.
He cried watching "Café Muller".

249
00:37:00,441 --> 00:37:02,432
I have to go.

250
00:37:03,681 --> 00:37:06,798
That fast?
We barely talked.

251
00:37:07,001 --> 00:37:10,038
-Maybe another time.
-Will you come in the afternoon?

252
00:37:10,401 --> 00:37:13,916
Come to see us. I am always here,
even during the night.

253
00:37:14,281 --> 00:37:17,273
I am a 'veteran' here.
If you need something...

254
00:37:40,561 --> 00:37:44,440
-Should I call Dr Vega;
-Carry on with what you are doing.

255
00:37:57,641 --> 00:38:01,793
The other day, while browsing
my notes...

256
00:38:02,761 --> 00:38:07,516
...I found some 
from your visit.

257
00:38:08,001 --> 00:38:12,313
I wrote a topic to be discussed
during the second visit...

258
00:38:12,601 --> 00:38:14,910
...that never took place.

259
00:38:15,201 --> 00:38:18,671
-What about?
-Your sexual orientation.

260
00:38:20,561 --> 00:38:24,873
-My sexual orientation?
-yes, your sexuality.

261
00:38:25,481 --> 00:38:29,156
Whether you like men or women.

262
00:38:31,241 --> 00:38:35,200
During your visit, you said
you were still a virgin.

263
00:38:35,561 --> 00:38:39,349
Answering your question
somehow...

264
00:38:41,241 --> 00:38:44,870
... I think I look for men,
      mostly.

265
00:38:46,241 --> 00:38:50,280
-Is this why you came to see me?
-I can't remember now.

266
00:38:51,601 --> 00:38:55,560
I guess that's it...
But I am very well now.

267
00:38:55,681 --> 00:38:57,672
Do you have a partner?

268
00:38:57,921 --> 00:39:03,234
More or less. I am not alone
anymore. I don't have a problem.

269
00:39:03,881 --> 00:39:06,759
I hope you were not offended
by my question.

270
00:39:12,401 --> 00:39:14,471
Was her father here?

271
00:39:15,561 --> 00:39:17,916
He asked me if I am a fag.

272
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:21,553
He used an american expression,
more subtle.

273
00:39:21,641 --> 00:39:24,681
-What is my orientation?
-And what did you say?

274
00:39:24,681 --> 00:39:27,275
-That I like men.
-Really?

275
00:39:27,841 --> 00:39:30,309
No, you fool. I lied.

276
00:39:30,601 --> 00:39:33,911
How can he dare ask whether
I like men or women?

277
00:39:34,161 --> 00:39:37,153
-What does he care?
-I am glad I found out.

278
00:39:37,521 --> 00:39:42,276
Did he ask the head nurseor you 
if you like bestiality or coprophagy? 

279
00:39:42,601 --> 00:39:46,230
No, you are right. They don't
ask such things.

280
00:39:53,601 --> 00:39:58,152
I might go on a trip, and I won't 
be able to come and see you.

281
00:39:58,921 --> 00:40:02,681
But, in Geneva, they've 
offered me a creation...

282
00:40:02,681 --> 00:40:05,761
...a chorography
that thrills me.

283
00:40:05,761 --> 00:40:09,470
An old idea for a ballet.
I call it 'Trenches'.

284
00:40:09,561 --> 00:40:12,633
It is about the first
world war.

285
00:40:12,921 --> 00:40:15,515
I will need a lot of dancers...

286
00:40:15,601 --> 00:40:19,514
...because in the war there 
are a lot of soldiers.

287
00:40:19,841 --> 00:40:24,357
But everyone dances in Geneva. 
It is great.

288
00:40:24,761 --> 00:40:29,281
I want female dancers too, because
the soldier when dying...

289
00:40:29,281 --> 00:40:33,115
...lets his soul
get out of his body...

290
00:40:33,401 --> 00:40:37,076
...the ghost of which
will be a female dancer.

291
00:40:37,721 --> 00:40:41,121
With a white classic skirt
like 'Giselle'...

292
00:40:41,121 --> 00:40:44,881
...but with red stains of blood.

293
00:40:44,881 --> 00:40:46,281
Very good!

294
00:40:46,281 --> 00:40:48,321
Alicia loved it.

295
00:40:48,321 --> 00:40:52,360
It's good because life emerges
out of death.

296
00:40:53,081 --> 00:40:56,278
the female emerges from 
the male.

297
00:40:56,801 --> 00:40:59,599
And from the earthly emerges the...

298
00:41:02,801 --> 00:41:05,395
The beach?

299
00:41:07,041 --> 00:41:09,839
And from the earthly emerges the...

300
00:41:10,361 --> 00:41:12,352
The water?

301
00:41:13,161 --> 00:41:15,072
The ethereal.

302
00:41:15,681 --> 00:41:19,230
The ethereal...
the impreceptible, the ghost.

303
00:41:20,121 --> 00:41:24,160
I have the music. It is from
Kristof Penderesky.

304
00:41:24,721 --> 00:41:28,396
It was written for the victims
of Hiroshima, but it's OK.

305
00:41:28,641 --> 00:41:31,599
Of course. Alicia remembers
it perfectly well.

306
00:41:31,961 --> 00:41:36,113
It's music for the battle.
It's wild and beastly.

307
00:41:36,401 --> 00:41:40,121
And regarding the music during deaths
I have a masterpiece...

308
00:41:40,121 --> 00:41:43,591
...which you will listen to,
right now.

309
00:41:45,881 --> 00:41:48,395
It will drive you crazy.

310
00:41:54,681 --> 00:41:57,070
Alicia, my dear.

311
00:41:57,481 --> 00:41:59,949
Good bye, my dear.

312
00:42:08,281 --> 00:42:11,956
Good bye, Katerina.
And you look beautiful.

313
00:42:12,081 --> 00:42:15,312
-You should go ahead with 'Trenches'.
-I will.

314
00:42:29,321 --> 00:42:32,677
Look...We will place you
next to the window.

315
00:42:33,961 --> 00:42:37,351
You will be able to see your
friends dancing.

316
00:42:42,801 --> 00:42:44,837
I love this room.

317
00:42:45,961 --> 00:42:48,111
I will order everything.

318
00:42:53,921 --> 00:42:56,879
Come in and shut the door...

319
00:43:02,641 --> 00:43:05,314
How are you?...Shit down.

320
00:43:05,801 --> 00:43:08,281
Alicia, look who's here.

321
00:43:08,281 --> 00:43:11,114
We're just getting some air, 
reading magazines...

322
00:43:13,001 --> 00:43:16,081
Who was the lady that just left?

323
00:43:16,081 --> 00:43:18,800
Katerina, Alicia's teacher.

324
00:43:19,841 --> 00:43:22,309
Dancing teacher.

325
00:43:22,841 --> 00:43:24,832
Nice character, Katerina.

326
00:43:24,921 --> 00:43:28,311
She has a dancing school somewhere
here. Alicia was her student.

327
00:43:28,561 --> 00:43:31,633
And Katerina loves her like
her daughter.

328
00:43:39,521 --> 00:43:42,433
FOUR YEARS AGO

329
00:44:14,161 --> 00:44:17,358
Benigno, You are by the window
for half an hour.

330
00:44:17,521 --> 00:44:19,512
I am coming, mum.

331
00:45:06,521 --> 00:45:08,671
What's the matter? Are you 
following me?

332
00:45:12,841 --> 00:45:16,800
This is yours, I think.
It must have dropped you.

333
00:45:19,361 --> 00:45:22,558
is everything there?...
I didn't touch anything...

334
00:45:24,361 --> 00:45:27,081
-Where are you going?
-Home.

335
00:45:27,081 --> 00:45:30,441
Can I accompany you?
I have nothing else to do.

336
00:45:30,441 --> 00:45:34,514
-Yes, but I am going home.
-Of course...It will do me good.

337
00:45:34,761 --> 00:45:38,521
Dancing is my life.
I love dancing shows.

338
00:45:38,521 --> 00:45:41,081
-Do you like dancing?
-Yes, of course

339
00:45:41,081 --> 00:45:43,401
But I don't follow it.

340
00:45:43,401 --> 00:45:46,041
What else do you do,
besides dancing?

341
00:45:46,041 --> 00:45:49,829
I travel and watch old movies.

342
00:45:50,161 --> 00:45:53,995
Silent Cinema is attractive
to me, in particular.

343
00:45:55,761 --> 00:45:58,639
-Where do you go when you go out?
-I don't.

344
00:45:58,721 --> 00:46:00,801
You should go out.

345
00:46:00,801 --> 00:46:04,077
I was taking care of my mother,
but she passed away 2 months ago.

346
00:46:04,361 --> 00:46:07,876
I am sorry. Mine died too, 
years ago though.

347
00:46:09,281 --> 00:46:12,876
Here we are...
Thanks for the wallet.

348
00:46:40,081 --> 00:46:43,391
Dr Roncero, psychiatrist.
7th left.

349
00:46:46,801 --> 00:46:48,473
Twenty three.

350
00:46:50,361 --> 00:46:53,990
I was waiting for her by the window,
but that day she didn't come.

351
00:46:54,721 --> 00:46:58,680
But I knew her address and that 
her father was a psychiatrist.

352
00:47:06,481 --> 00:47:08,836
Dr Roncero's office.

353
00:47:09,521 --> 00:47:12,513
I would like to make an
appointment.

354
00:47:13,041 --> 00:47:16,477
-Is it tomorrow at 5 OK?
-Isn't earlier possible?

355
00:47:16,761 --> 00:47:18,956
No, tomorrow at 5.

356
00:47:19,241 --> 00:47:21,152
Your name?

357
00:47:37,601 --> 00:47:41,389
-What do you want?
-I have an appointment at 5.

358
00:47:50,161 --> 00:47:52,675
Come in. Don't stand there.

359
00:47:58,921 --> 00:48:02,550
Benigno Martin?...
I need some proof.

360
00:48:04,441 --> 00:48:08,593
I just wanted to see Alicia,
but I was there, in a psychiatrist.

361
00:48:08,921 --> 00:48:11,833
I decided to tell him I missed
my mother.

362
00:48:14,321 --> 00:48:17,438
I started when I was little.

363
00:48:17,761 --> 00:48:22,118
And all those 15 years
you took care of your mother?

364
00:48:23,081 --> 00:48:27,472
I was always next to her...
I was studying to be a nurse.

365
00:48:27,881 --> 00:48:31,157
I was only going out to the
classes.

366
00:48:31,241 --> 00:48:35,401
I was also studying aesthetics,
make-up and hairdressing.

367
00:48:35,401 --> 00:48:37,869
But those by post.

368
00:48:38,121 --> 00:48:41,750
So you did those on your mother?

369
00:48:42,121 --> 00:48:45,641
Of course, and I cut her hair, 
dyed it, did her nails.

370
00:48:45,641 --> 00:48:48,713
And I scrubbed her down well, 
front and back.

371
00:48:49,081 --> 00:48:52,198
My mother wasn't disabled, or mad.

372
00:48:52,361 --> 00:48:54,795
She was only a bit lazy.

373
00:48:55,761 --> 00:48:59,549
She was a beautiful woman
and I didn't want to let herself go.

374
00:49:00,161 --> 00:49:03,631
-What did your father say?
-Nothing. What could he?

375
00:49:03,841 --> 00:49:06,753
-Is he dead?
-God, no.

376
00:49:07,121 --> 00:49:11,797
He is in Sweden, I guess.
I haven't heard of him for years.

377
00:49:12,121 --> 00:49:14,589
Doesn't he come to see you?

378
00:49:15,601 --> 00:49:19,913
He has his own family there,
after he left my mother.

379
00:49:22,401 --> 00:49:25,040
We are not in touch.

380
00:49:25,321 --> 00:49:28,393
Why did you come to see me, 
Benigno?

381
00:49:29,601 --> 00:49:32,641
-What's your problem?
-Me? Nothing.

382
00:49:32,641 --> 00:49:36,793
You must have since you came
to see a psychiatrist.

383
00:49:39,361 --> 00:49:41,921
Loneliness, I guess.

384
00:49:44,561 --> 00:49:47,792
Did you have a sexual 
relationship with a woman?

385
00:49:49,561 --> 00:49:52,439
-With a man?
-No, neither.

386
00:49:54,721 --> 00:49:57,519
I will see you in a week.

387
00:49:57,841 --> 00:50:00,881
-Am I not well doctor?
-That's not it...

388
00:50:00,881 --> 00:50:04,921
However, your adolescence was
kind of special.

389
00:50:04,921 --> 00:50:08,516
-It wasn't special.
-It was. Very special.

390
00:50:09,841 --> 00:50:12,721
And we must analyse it in depth.

391
00:50:12,721 --> 00:50:14,837
Yes, lets analyse it.

392
00:50:19,561 --> 00:50:22,678
-Should I come in a week?
-Very well.

393
00:50:23,401 --> 00:50:25,471
I am glad.

394
00:51:54,201 --> 00:51:57,910
-What are you doing here?
-I was just going. Don't be angry.

395
00:51:58,401 --> 00:52:02,440
I just wanted to see you...
But I am harmless.

396
00:52:18,801 --> 00:52:22,430
Dr Roncero's office...
Hi, Lola...

397
00:52:22,801 --> 00:52:26,635
I just had a shit of
huge dimensions.

398
00:53:12,841 --> 00:53:15,480
Can you be in charge?

399
00:53:31,081 --> 00:53:35,074
Alicia never came back. I 
didn't want to scare her again.

400
00:53:35,441 --> 00:53:39,070
After a week I went to her 
place, to see her father.

401
00:53:39,961 --> 00:53:42,634
It was raining during that 
whole week.

402
00:53:48,881 --> 00:53:51,841
Next time I saw her was here.

403
00:53:51,841 --> 00:53:53,559
What happened to her?

404
00:53:53,641 --> 00:53:56,713
A car accident,
during a rainy day.

405
00:53:58,041 --> 00:54:02,034
Her father didn't want her to 
be alone, not even for a moment.

406
00:54:02,121 --> 00:54:04,635
He asked for the best nurses.

407
00:54:04,801 --> 00:54:09,397
And I have a good reputation here...
So they suggested me...

408
00:54:09,801 --> 00:54:14,716
And when he saw me, he remembered 
me, and hesitated for a moment.

409
00:54:15,121 --> 00:54:18,670
But in the end, he took 
Matilde and me, exclusively.

410
00:54:18,961 --> 00:54:22,715
And this was four years ago...
And here we are now...

411
00:54:22,961 --> 00:54:24,633
Right, Alicia?

412
00:54:29,001 --> 00:54:32,361
I started going to the ballet, 
when I had a day-off.

413
00:54:32,361 --> 00:54:35,956
And to the film library to watch
silent movies.

414
00:54:36,121 --> 00:54:39,431
German, american, italian
films, everything.

415
00:54:39,721 --> 00:54:42,758
And afterwards I would tell her
about all that she had seen.

416
00:54:43,921 --> 00:54:47,361
The four most complete years
of my life.

417
00:54:47,361 --> 00:54:49,561
I take care of Alicia...

418
00:54:49,561 --> 00:54:53,315
I do what she would, except
the trips, of course.

419
00:54:53,561 --> 00:54:56,553
With me and Lydia
it's the opposite.

420
00:54:58,561 --> 00:55:00,870
I can't touch her.

421
00:55:03,201 --> 00:55:06,079
I don't recognize her body.

422
00:55:06,241 --> 00:55:10,154
Neither can I help the nurses
turn her around.

423
00:55:10,841 --> 00:55:13,881
And I feel I am lousy.

424
00:55:13,881 --> 00:55:16,841
Talk to her. Tell her that.

425
00:55:16,841 --> 00:55:19,150
I would like to,
but she can't hear me.

426
00:55:19,401 --> 00:55:21,995
How are you so certain 
about this?

427
00:55:22,081 --> 00:55:25,198
Her brain is dead, Benigno.

428
00:55:25,561 --> 00:55:29,395
The woman's mind is a mystery,
especially in such sickness.

429
00:55:29,841 --> 00:55:33,629
You must look after the woman,
talk to her...

430
00:55:33,721 --> 00:55:37,641
...don't foget that she's alive
 and that you love her.

431
00:55:37,641 --> 00:55:41,759
This is the only therapy.
I know from experience.

432
00:55:43,281 --> 00:55:46,239
And what do you know 
about women?

433
00:55:46,721 --> 00:55:50,555
Benigno, what do you know
about women?

434
00:55:54,841 --> 00:55:57,961
What do you know about women?

435
00:55:57,961 --> 00:56:02,477
A lot. 20 years next to one, 
4 with another.

436
00:56:04,401 --> 00:56:08,401
I like the bullfighter's boyfriend. 
He has style.

437
00:56:08,401 --> 00:56:11,361
How do you know? You saw him?

438
00:56:11,361 --> 00:56:15,479
Of course not, but I can tell
from his face.

439
00:56:15,881 --> 00:56:18,793
And his bulging trousers.

440
00:56:21,641 --> 00:56:24,280
He is a good friend of 
Benigno, right;

441
00:56:26,041 --> 00:56:30,637
-Is he gay too?
-No way. What are you saying now?

442
00:56:30,921 --> 00:56:34,834
-Is Benigno, you think?
-Rumours say so!

443
00:56:35,121 --> 00:56:38,321
-You are wrong.
-Dr Vega told me so as well.

444
00:56:38,321 --> 00:56:42,121
-And where did he find out?
-From Alicia's father.

445
00:56:42,121 --> 00:56:45,401
I don't like the intimacy
he has with the patient...

446
00:56:45,401 --> 00:56:49,030
...but Vega told me not to
worry, becayse he is gay.

447
00:56:49,761 --> 00:56:53,470
I am going and I'll let you
carry on talking crap about him.

448
00:56:57,441 --> 00:57:01,116
-She likes Benigno.
-She is not with her senses.

449
00:57:07,121 --> 00:57:10,081
I have the day off.
I am going to the film library.

450
00:57:10,081 --> 00:57:13,201
-Are you coming?
-I will see my publisher tonight.

451
00:57:13,201 --> 00:57:16,079
I have to go back to work soon.

452
00:57:16,841 --> 00:57:19,594
This woman is not well.

453
00:57:20,761 --> 00:57:25,152
You know what I mean.
Her skin is dry.

454
00:57:25,841 --> 00:57:28,560
lets see... Here...

455
00:57:32,161 --> 00:57:35,676
-Did you talk to her?
-No, and don't insist.

456
00:57:40,801 --> 00:57:44,589
Hi, Lydia. You must be
patient with him.

457
00:57:48,041 --> 00:57:50,032
Have a good time at work.

458
00:58:03,921 --> 00:58:06,355
'Shrinked lover'.

459
00:58:18,441 --> 00:58:22,400
Rosa has the flu.
I hope you didn't get it from her.

460
00:58:25,321 --> 00:58:29,041
I am glad you feel well,
but I will massage you...

461
00:58:29,041 --> 00:58:32,113
...and I will rub you with
a rosemary lotion.

462
00:58:55,001 --> 00:58:57,993
No, nothing is happening to me.

463
00:58:59,721 --> 00:59:04,476
Last night I saw a movie that
shook me a lot.

464
00:59:06,921 --> 00:59:09,921
It was the love story...

465
00:59:09,921 --> 00:59:14,278
...of Alfredo, a nice young 
guy, but a bit fat...

466
00:59:15,081 --> 00:59:18,756
...kai Amparo's friend
who is a scientist.

467
00:59:19,481 --> 00:59:22,553
Amparo prepares a new
experimental diet...

468
00:59:22,881 --> 00:59:25,873
...that will revolutionize
the food industry.

469
00:59:27,241 --> 00:59:29,755
What egoism! You only
think of yourself!

470
00:59:56,001 --> 00:59:57,593
I found it!

471
01:00:04,921 --> 01:00:09,073
It might be dangerous. I never
gave it to a human before.

472
01:00:17,201 --> 01:00:19,635
You still think I act 
with selfishness?

473
01:00:50,801 --> 01:00:53,076
It has done miracles for you!

474
01:01:04,441 --> 01:01:07,990
Don't worry, my love!
I will find the antidote!

475
01:01:15,841 --> 01:01:17,881
Time was passing by...

476
01:01:17,881 --> 01:01:20,839
...but Amparo couldn't find
the antidote...

477
01:01:21,161 --> 01:01:24,551
...and poor Alfredo,
day by day, shrank in misery.

478
01:01:29,161 --> 01:01:31,629
I will always love you.

479
01:01:32,801 --> 01:01:35,361
So that Amparo doesn't suffer...

480
01:01:35,361 --> 01:01:39,070
...Alfredo leaves and goes
to find his mother.

481
01:01:39,201 --> 01:01:42,352
He hadn't seen her for 10 years,
beacause he was lousy.

482
01:01:42,841 --> 01:01:46,436
He hadn't told Ambaro
where his mother lived.

483
01:01:46,721 --> 01:01:50,111
Lots of things going on 
in this movie.

484
01:01:50,561 --> 01:01:53,314
But the most important 
thing is...

485
01:01:53,961 --> 01:01:58,239
...after years full of 
regrets and studies...

486
01:01:59,401 --> 01:02:03,633
...Amparo finds the address
of his mother.

487
01:02:05,721 --> 01:02:08,281
And goes there.

488
01:02:52,601 --> 01:02:55,752
Hotel Iukali.
Room 15.

489
01:03:22,441 --> 01:03:25,717
-Sleep, my darling.
-And what if I be a burden by mistake?

490
01:05:51,201 --> 01:05:53,510
And Alfredo...

491
01:05:55,921 --> 01:05:58,754
...stays inside her...

492
01:06:01,441 --> 01:06:03,796
...for ever.

493
01:06:24,161 --> 01:06:28,200
AFTER ONE MONTH

494
01:06:29,241 --> 01:06:33,234
Come on, put your hands 
correctly ... This way...

495
01:06:38,801 --> 01:06:41,918
It's quite cool...
It's great...

496
01:06:42,321 --> 01:06:45,313
It's nice here by 
the balcony, right?

497
01:06:45,561 --> 01:06:48,633
Lydia likes to sit by
the balcony as well.

498
01:06:49,401 --> 01:06:51,915
Did you hear that? She likes
it a lot.

499
01:06:52,601 --> 01:06:56,719
Look at them... It's as if 
they are talking about us.

500
01:06:58,801 --> 01:07:01,110
What do you think they say?

501
01:07:01,841 --> 01:07:04,401
They have no shame.

502
01:07:04,401 --> 01:07:07,757
Women talk about everything
with each other.

503
01:07:09,041 --> 01:07:13,000
Lydia would tell her she has
completed two months sick.

504
01:07:48,441 --> 01:07:50,761
Benjamin and Angela...

505
01:07:50,761 --> 01:07:54,879
...will you bond in marriage,
with your own will?

506
01:07:58,001 --> 01:08:01,630
Join your hands together...

507
01:08:02,001 --> 01:08:06,119
...and declare your wish
in front of God.

508
01:08:10,361 --> 01:08:13,353
I, Angela,
take you, Benjamin...

509
01:08:13,841 --> 01:08:16,992
...to be my lawful husband...

510
01:08:17,361 --> 01:08:20,990
    I will love you
in happiness and in sickness...

511
01:08:21,481 --> 01:08:25,554
...so long as we shall both live.

512
01:08:26,801 --> 01:08:29,998
The Lord that joined you in love...

513
01:08:30,281 --> 01:08:34,479
...let him accept your declaration
of love today.

514
01:08:34,881 --> 01:08:38,556
May your love last eternally.

515
01:08:39,121 --> 01:08:42,352
What are you doing here? We
were gonna meet at the hotel.

516
01:08:42,441 --> 01:08:46,480
I changed my mind.
I've always liked weddings.

517
01:08:46,761 --> 01:08:50,037
Weren't you gonna see
your sister before the game?

518
01:08:50,281 --> 01:08:53,241
I called her.
She will come to the hotel.

519
01:08:53,241 --> 01:08:56,441
I promised her we will eat at
the restaurant tonight.

520
01:08:56,441 --> 01:08:58,352
As you wish.

521
01:09:03,121 --> 01:09:06,875
-Nice ceremony, right?
-Excellent.

522
01:09:09,961 --> 01:09:13,954
-I didn't expect her so young.
-You don't trust me right?

523
01:09:14,881 --> 01:09:18,237
We can't have another day
passing by without talking.

524
01:09:18,601 --> 01:09:22,719
Don't worry. Finish with Angela, 
I have proof.

525
01:09:23,281 --> 01:09:27,161
For example, at the ceremony
I didn't cry, you did.

526
01:09:27,161 --> 01:09:29,994
-Right.
-And you shouldn't have.

527
01:09:30,161 --> 01:09:32,197
Don't you believe me?

528
01:09:32,481 --> 01:09:36,633
I needed 10 years to get over
it. I finally made it.

529
01:09:38,801 --> 01:09:41,793
Lydia, trust me,
it's over.

530
01:09:42,521 --> 01:09:44,961
I travelled with Angela.

531
01:09:44,961 --> 01:09:48,510
The excuse was to write
a travel guide.

532
01:09:48,841 --> 01:09:53,198
In reality, I wanted her
out of Madrid and drugs.

533
01:09:53,601 --> 01:09:57,833
Madrid is hell. Our relationship
functioned outside it.

534
01:09:58,601 --> 01:10:02,201
After five trips, 
I brought her to her parents...

535
01:10:02,201 --> 01:10:06,274
...who kept her away
from drugs and from me.

536
01:10:06,881 --> 01:10:08,951
Did you still love her?

537
01:10:10,521 --> 01:10:14,514
I cried not being able to share
things with her.

538
01:10:15,521 --> 01:10:19,480
It's terrible to leave
a person you love so much.

539
01:10:20,161 --> 01:10:22,356
What a sad story!

540
01:10:22,961 --> 01:10:26,441
Love is a sad thing when 
it ends...

541
01:10:26,441 --> 01:10:28,909
...as the song says.

542
01:10:29,241 --> 01:10:31,880
Marco, we need to talk afterwards.

543
01:10:32,161 --> 01:10:36,040
-We've been talking for an hour.
-You have, not me.

544
01:10:36,761 --> 01:10:38,752
You're right.

545
01:11:04,161 --> 01:11:07,358
My leg needs two months of therapy,
 said the doctor.

546
01:11:07,681 --> 01:11:10,673
But you know what? I am glad 
that bull hit me.

547
01:11:11,081 --> 01:11:14,321
Now I can stay with you until
you wake up.

548
01:11:14,321 --> 01:11:16,789
No one will take me away from you.

549
01:11:18,401 --> 01:11:21,677
We got back together,
a month ago...

550
01:11:22,961 --> 01:11:26,795
Lydia would tell you at the
wedding. She didn't in the end.

551
01:11:29,481 --> 01:11:32,200
It was you she cried for.

552
01:11:34,401 --> 01:11:38,792
She called me to tell me
she cried for me.

553
01:11:40,161 --> 01:11:42,921
Last time we spoke.

554
01:11:42,921 --> 01:11:46,311
Now that I don't fight
due to injury...

555
01:11:46,441 --> 01:11:49,481
...I would like to stay
near her during the night.

556
01:11:49,481 --> 01:11:51,756
Like at your place.

557
01:12:28,041 --> 01:12:30,430
I am alone again.

558
01:12:34,561 --> 01:12:37,081
You were looking at her breasts.

559
01:12:37,081 --> 01:12:40,153
Difficult to avoid it.
They grow by the day.

560
01:12:40,481 --> 01:12:44,952
Benigno, I am thinking of taking
a trip... I have to work.

561
01:12:45,401 --> 01:12:47,437
And Lydia?

562
01:12:47,961 --> 01:12:50,350
She doesn't need me anymore.

563
01:12:52,281 --> 01:12:54,272
Did you break up?

564
01:12:55,201 --> 01:12:58,121
You can call it that way.

565
01:12:58,121 --> 01:13:02,080
I expected this, Marco.
Don't ask why, I just did.

566
01:13:03,601 --> 01:13:08,117
There was something in your
relationship that didn't function right.

567
01:13:08,441 --> 01:13:10,481
When are you going?

568
01:13:10,481 --> 01:13:13,359
Soon, but I'll see you before
I go.

569
01:13:13,641 --> 01:13:15,996
I am so sorry you are going.

570
01:13:20,761 --> 01:13:23,719
I am leaving, Benigno.
I'll see you soon.

571
01:13:26,001 --> 01:13:29,550
She didn't have her period yet?

572
01:13:31,001 --> 01:13:34,960
I am looking at the month's report.
She should have had it.

573
01:13:36,281 --> 01:13:38,636
Yes, it's a bit late.

574
01:13:50,401 --> 01:13:54,280
Two weeks. That's a lot.
Are you sure she had it last month?

575
01:13:54,921 --> 01:13:59,039
I personally dealt with it.
It was when you had the flu.

576
01:14:00,201 --> 01:14:02,476
She seems a bit swollen.

577
01:14:02,881 --> 01:14:05,321
They often have abnormalities.

578
01:14:05,321 --> 01:14:08,597
For example, Lydia
doesn't have a period anymore.

579
01:14:09,081 --> 01:14:12,676
Anyway, we should tell Dr Vega.

580
01:14:30,521 --> 01:14:34,116
I brought some of my guides
for Alicia and you.

581
01:14:35,801 --> 01:14:38,110
I said goodbye to Lydia.

582
01:14:39,641 --> 01:14:43,839
I went to see Alicia, but they
didn't let me enter the room.

583
01:14:45,761 --> 01:14:47,911
Is there something wrong?

584
01:14:48,321 --> 01:14:51,279
No. Just some infection
that Alicia got.

585
01:14:51,481 --> 01:14:54,441
Can you drive me home?
I am done with work.

586
01:14:54,441 --> 01:14:57,521
-It's not serious, I hope.
-I don't know.

587
01:14:57,521 --> 01:15:01,434
They do some medical exams,
but they haven't told me anything.

588
01:15:02,441 --> 01:15:05,481
Brazil...

589
01:15:05,481 --> 01:15:07,711
...Turkey, Cuba.

590
01:15:08,561 --> 01:15:11,633
-I will read them to Alicia.
-They are guides.

591
01:15:12,081 --> 01:15:14,921
Yours. They must be good.

592
01:15:14,921 --> 01:15:17,435
-Are you travelling alone?
-Yes.

593
01:15:17,721 --> 01:15:20,758
I would like to talk to you
about this before you go.

594
01:15:21,081 --> 01:15:24,232
-About what?
-loneliness.

595
01:15:24,401 --> 01:15:26,676
I want to get married.

596
01:15:29,201 --> 01:15:32,241
-Alicia, of course!
-Benigno, you are nuts!

597
01:15:32,241 --> 01:15:35,281
We will get along better than
most couples.

598
01:15:35,281 --> 01:15:38,512
-Why shouldn't I marry her?
-Because she is in a coma!

599
01:15:40,201 --> 01:15:43,750
Because she can't say 'yes'
in the church!

600
01:15:44,161 --> 01:15:47,721
Because, she is virtually dead!

601
01:15:47,721 --> 01:15:49,561
Get in the car!

602
01:15:49,561 --> 01:15:51,995
-What are you talking about?
-Get in the car!

603
01:15:58,001 --> 01:16:01,437
Your relationship with Alicia
is a crazy monologue!

604
01:16:01,721 --> 01:16:05,236
We often talk to PVS,
but we don't marry them.

605
01:16:05,801 --> 01:16:09,635
Incredible what you are saying.
I had a different opinion of you.

606
01:16:09,921 --> 01:16:13,436
Don't say or think about it
ever again!

607
01:16:14,001 --> 01:16:18,597
Promise!...If you say that to 
anyone else, you will be in trouble!

608
01:16:20,681 --> 01:16:23,639
If that calms you down,
then I promise.

609
01:16:23,881 --> 01:16:26,921
-Regardless of how much you like her...
-You like her too, right?

610
01:16:26,921 --> 01:16:28,991
Of course I like her.

611
01:16:29,561 --> 01:16:33,241
-She likes you too.
-She is virtually dead!

612
01:16:33,241 --> 01:16:37,121
She has no feelings about me,
you, or herself!

613
01:16:37,121 --> 01:16:39,635
Understand that!

614
01:16:44,641 --> 01:16:48,441
Our patient Alicia Roncero
was raped and is pregnant.

615
01:16:48,441 --> 01:16:51,721
Before I tell her father
I want you to tell me...

616
01:16:51,721 --> 01:16:54,761
...which bastard did it!

617
01:16:54,761 --> 01:16:57,121
Everyone is upset.

618
01:16:57,121 --> 01:17:00,830
You are responsible. Alicia
was on your floor.

619
01:17:01,081 --> 01:17:04,232
Then allow me to explain the
situation.

620
01:17:04,841 --> 01:17:07,036
Rosa, please.

621
01:17:08,201 --> 01:17:11,955
Alicia's period stopped
two months ago.

622
01:17:12,321 --> 01:17:16,314
I thought it was one month
initially, but I was wrong.

623
01:17:16,521 --> 01:17:19,558
It wasn't in last month's report.

624
01:17:19,761 --> 01:17:22,753
It says it was dealt with normally.

625
01:17:23,001 --> 01:17:26,198
I was down with flu 
during that week.

626
01:17:27,161 --> 01:17:30,119
You wrote that.
Right, Benigno?

627
01:17:30,361 --> 01:17:33,398
-It is your typewriting.
-Yes, it was me.

628
01:17:33,601 --> 01:17:36,434
Why did you lie?

629
01:17:36,961 --> 01:17:39,401
I didn't want it to become a problem.

630
01:17:39,401 --> 01:17:42,837
On other occasions, the patients' 
periods have also stopped.

631
01:17:44,081 --> 01:17:48,040
How come no one noticed?
Where is the night person?

632
01:17:48,241 --> 01:17:51,438
She can't come today.
She phoned.

633
01:17:51,521 --> 01:17:53,681
Didn't see notice anything strange?

634
01:17:53,681 --> 01:17:57,913
She has problems at home.
A lot of nights she doesn't come.

635
01:17:58,121 --> 01:18:00,681
And who replaces her?

636
01:18:04,201 --> 01:18:07,273
I will tell Roncero
that his daughter...

637
01:18:07,601 --> 01:18:10,399
...is day and night with
a nutter?

638
01:18:10,481 --> 01:18:12,676
Lets calm down for a bit.

639
01:18:14,281 --> 01:18:19,355
Benigno, do you realise you
are the prime suspect?

640
01:18:20,201 --> 01:18:23,281
Why did you hide the first delay?

641
01:18:23,281 --> 01:18:27,479
What explanation do you have?
Would you ever harm Alicia?

642
01:18:27,721 --> 01:18:29,632
Definitely not!

643
01:18:35,001 --> 01:18:37,761
Last night I was
at the parkin lot...

644
01:18:37,761 --> 01:18:41,595
...and overheard a discussion
between Benigno and Marco.

645
01:18:41,681 --> 01:18:45,071
Benigno said he wanted to
marry Alicia.

646
01:18:45,441 --> 01:18:49,275
Marco tried to change his mind,
but in vain.

647
01:18:52,041 --> 01:18:54,401
Lots of couples, he said...

648
01:18:54,401 --> 01:18:57,757
...don'r get along
as well as him and Alicia.

649
01:18:59,841 --> 01:19:03,311
AFTER EIGHT MONTHS

650
01:19:19,041 --> 01:19:22,954
It was Lydia Gonzales' funeral 
yesterday, at Almudena.

651
01:19:24,121 --> 01:19:29,354
The thirty-year old bullfighter
was in a coma since...

652
01:19:32,401 --> 01:19:35,321
Can I speak with
Benigno Martin?

653
01:19:35,321 --> 01:19:37,391
He doesn't work here anymore.

654
01:19:38,481 --> 01:19:40,711
-Are you sure?
-Positive.

655
01:19:41,081 --> 01:19:43,561
-And sister Rosa Lazaga;
-Who are you?

656
01:19:43,561 --> 01:19:46,121
-Marco Zuloaga.
-I will put you through.

657
01:19:50,441 --> 01:19:53,399
-Who is it?
-Marco Zuloaga.

658
01:19:54,281 --> 01:19:57,321
I am calling from Jordan.
I found out about Lydia.

659
01:19:57,321 --> 01:19:59,755
I am sorry, Marco.

660
01:20:00,401 --> 01:20:02,756
You should have called me.

661
01:20:04,161 --> 01:20:06,550
We had a lot of problems here.

662
01:20:06,801 --> 01:20:09,918
What happened? Benigno isn't
there anymore, I was told.

663
01:20:10,361 --> 01:20:13,398
Benigno is in jail.

664
01:20:16,241 --> 01:20:19,870
He is accused of raping Alicia.

665
01:20:22,321 --> 01:20:25,361
Help him. He has no one 
the poor guy.

666
01:20:25,361 --> 01:20:27,401
Did you go see him?

667
01:20:27,401 --> 01:20:30,199
After what he did, I can't.

668
01:20:30,441 --> 01:20:33,592
However he does need help,
and you are his friend.

669
01:20:33,801 --> 01:20:37,157
-What prison is he in?
-In Zegovia.

670
01:21:26,001 --> 01:21:28,515
Wait for me here.

671
01:21:43,321 --> 01:21:46,681
-I want to see a prisoner.
-In the visting section.

672
01:21:46,681 --> 01:21:49,115
Through this door,on the left.

673
01:21:59,961 --> 01:22:02,961
I want prisoner Benigno Martin.

674
01:22:02,961 --> 01:22:05,961
It isn't a visting day,
but I will see whether...

675
01:22:05,961 --> 01:22:08,077
I am sorry, I can't hear you.

676
01:22:09,241 --> 01:22:11,601
It isn't a visiting day.

677
01:22:11,601 --> 01:22:15,389
And the lodger didn't ask 
for a visit.

678
01:22:15,881 --> 01:22:18,998
He doesn't know I am in Madrid. 
I came today.

679
01:22:19,401 --> 01:22:22,632
-Are you a relative?
-A friend.

680
01:22:22,761 --> 01:22:26,436
-Marco Zuloaga is my name.
-Can I see your I.D.?

681
01:22:29,201 --> 01:22:32,989
-Can I call him?
-He will call you.

682
01:22:33,281 --> 01:22:36,751
I have changed number. Can you
give him the new one?

683
01:22:45,681 --> 01:22:47,721
And remember.

684
01:22:47,721 --> 01:22:50,997
Visiting days are Saturday
and Sunday.

685
01:22:51,321 --> 01:22:55,109
But the lodger should ask for
the visit.

686
01:22:55,401 --> 01:22:58,518
If he doesn't want to see you,
there is nothing we can do.

687
01:23:00,001 --> 01:23:03,960
And something else. We don't
have prisoners here...

688
01:23:04,961 --> 01:23:09,239
We don't have prisoners here,
we have lodgers.

689
01:23:44,681 --> 01:23:46,956
Marco, is that you?

690
01:23:47,841 --> 01:23:52,039
I am glad to hear your voice. 
I asked your visit on Saturday.

691
01:23:54,401 --> 01:23:56,631
-Where are you?
-Outside the clinique.

692
01:23:58,721 --> 01:24:02,634
Dr Vega told me everything.
How could you do it?

693
01:24:03,281 --> 01:24:06,398
Did you come back to Spain
to get on my back?

694
01:24:07,681 --> 01:24:10,639
Do you need anything?
What should I bring you on Saturday?

695
01:24:10,721 --> 01:24:14,241
I need information.
What do you know about Alicia?

696
01:24:14,241 --> 01:24:16,471
They wouldn't say anything
from the clinique.

697
01:24:16,801 --> 01:24:18,951
She is in a different one.
They don't know where.

698
01:24:19,041 --> 01:24:21,801
-I don't believe this.
-Neither do I.

699
01:24:21,801 --> 01:24:24,599
But I am not surpised they 
won't tell us.

700
01:24:24,881 --> 01:24:28,317
-Are you still my friend?
-Of course. Since I am here.

701
01:24:28,521 --> 01:24:30,751
Then find out about Alicia.

702
01:24:31,121 --> 01:24:34,397
Whether she's alive, whether she gave 
birth, whether the baby is alive...

703
01:24:34,601 --> 01:24:38,310
I need to know, Marco...
You understand, right?

704
01:24:40,721 --> 01:24:45,158
I will try to...
Talk to you on Saturday...

705
01:24:47,161 --> 01:24:50,676
-Did you find out anything?
-I will. Be patient.

706
01:24:51,001 --> 01:24:56,121
I was, until the day she would
give birth. One month ago.

707
01:24:56,801 --> 01:24:59,076
You must wait.

708
01:25:05,041 --> 01:25:09,239
-What do you do during the day here?
-I work in the recovery room.

709
01:25:09,961 --> 01:25:14,432
It's a new prison, few people. 
It's quiet in here.

710
01:25:15,001 --> 01:25:18,357
-It doesn't look like a prison from outside.
-The problem is elsewhere!

711
01:25:18,801 --> 01:25:21,679
That I don't see Alicia.

712
01:25:22,361 --> 01:25:26,354
The doctor ki o Dr Roncero
say I am a psychopath.

713
01:25:29,641 --> 01:25:33,475
This is good for the trail, they say,
but I don't care about the trial.

714
01:25:33,841 --> 01:25:37,720
I need to see Alicia,
to find out how everything went.

715
01:25:38,361 --> 01:25:42,434
If this goes on, I don't
know what I am capable of doing!

716
01:25:42,641 --> 01:25:44,801
I am a psychopath, they say?
Then I will act like one!

717
01:25:44,801 --> 01:25:46,757
Don't say that, Benigno!

718
01:25:47,881 --> 01:25:52,113
And find me another lawyer.
The one I have despises me.

719
01:25:54,601 --> 01:25:58,674
I will rent my place so that
I can pay him.

720
01:25:59,081 --> 01:26:02,121
I will rent it.
I am currently homeless.

721
01:26:02,121 --> 01:26:05,397
Great. I am glad you will be
my tenant.

722
01:26:06,161 --> 01:26:10,074
I was thinking about you a lot, 
especially during the nights.

723
01:26:10,841 --> 01:26:14,197
-Why during the nights?
-Because I study during the nights.

724
01:26:14,441 --> 01:26:17,114
I read all your guides.

725
01:26:17,281 --> 01:26:20,841
Like travelling with you
next to me...

726
01:26:20,841 --> 01:26:23,230
...telling me things.

727
01:26:23,521 --> 01:26:26,558
I liked Avan's the most.

728
01:26:26,801 --> 01:26:29,031
I became one with those people...

729
01:26:29,121 --> 01:26:32,158
...that have nothing
and invent everything.

730
01:26:33,121 --> 01:26:36,281
And you describing
the Cuban girl...

731
01:26:36,281 --> 01:26:39,201
...in front of her window
by the sea...

732
01:26:39,201 --> 01:26:41,237
...waiting in vain...

733
01:26:41,721 --> 01:26:44,793
...for something that will
never happen.

734
01:26:45,401 --> 01:26:48,359
I was thinking that woman is me.

735
01:27:06,361 --> 01:27:09,512
Good morning. I am Benigno's
friend.

736
01:27:10,041 --> 01:27:12,760
You are Marco, the Argentinian?

737
01:27:13,121 --> 01:27:17,751
Benigno called me.
Will you take his appartment?

738
01:27:18,561 --> 01:27:22,793
It will be dirty. He wouldn't
let me in to clean it.

739
01:27:24,241 --> 01:27:28,200
-And I didn't want any money...
-It's OK, I will take care of it.

740
01:27:28,481 --> 01:27:32,110
Shall I give you the key?...
I will go look for it...

741
01:27:38,601 --> 01:27:40,592
Did you see him?

742
01:27:41,681 --> 01:27:44,434
-How is he?
-Well.

743
01:27:45,641 --> 01:27:49,561
Poor guy, he wasn't even lucky
during his imprisonment.

744
01:27:49,561 --> 01:27:51,761
No publicity!

745
01:27:51,761 --> 01:27:55,879
No TV, no reporters.
No one came here.

746
01:27:56,361 --> 01:27:59,521
They didn't condescend!
And they show such garbage!

747
01:27:59,521 --> 01:28:01,591
I would give them an interview!

748
01:28:01,841 --> 01:28:04,355
The media is shit in this country!

749
01:28:04,521 --> 01:28:06,432
You are right.

750
01:28:06,921 --> 01:28:08,957
The keys...

751
01:28:09,521 --> 01:28:13,912
Anyway...Do you know why
Benigno is in prison?

752
01:28:14,361 --> 01:28:18,479
He is very quiet. He didn't say
a word last time he came.

753
01:28:19,041 --> 01:28:21,999
-Benigno is innocent.
-Yes, I know.

754
01:28:22,241 --> 01:28:25,153
-Innocent about what?
-I don't know.

755
01:28:25,521 --> 01:28:28,638
You do, but you don't want
to tell me.

756
01:28:33,601 --> 01:28:36,991
If you need something,
you know where I am.

757
01:30:30,601 --> 01:30:34,389
I was glad you stepped in 
by yourself today, without crutches.

758
01:30:36,841 --> 01:30:39,601
-How did the exercise go today?
-Very well.

759
01:30:39,601 --> 01:30:41,761
-Were you tired?
-A lot.

760
01:30:41,761 --> 01:30:45,231
It doesn't matter. We will
do some extra exercises.

761
01:30:46,481 --> 01:30:49,154
We will do some stretches.

762
01:30:49,481 --> 01:30:53,156
-But I already did 100.
-We'll do a few more.

763
01:31:28,721 --> 01:31:31,394
I have an appointment with
Mr. Sainz.

764
01:31:35,721 --> 01:31:38,554
The boy was born dead.

765
01:31:38,681 --> 01:31:41,761
Alicia recovered.
Benigno hasn't found out.

766
01:31:41,761 --> 01:31:44,992
In his condition,
he could do something crazy.

767
01:31:45,401 --> 01:31:49,076
I can't lie to him.
He is my only friend.

768
01:31:49,561 --> 01:31:53,001
I will tell him.
I have no problem.

769
01:31:53,001 --> 01:31:56,550
Alicia is still in coma and
the baby dead, I will say.

770
01:31:56,721 --> 01:31:59,561
But you don't tell him anything.

771
01:31:59,561 --> 01:32:04,157
-Can he bail out?
-Very difficult, and expensive.

772
01:32:31,681 --> 01:32:34,361
-You are wet.
-A little.

773
01:32:34,361 --> 01:32:39,037
Be careful not to catch a cold.
Drink hot milk with honey.

774
01:32:50,201 --> 01:32:53,989
Since I am here,
I like rainy days.

775
01:32:56,481 --> 01:32:59,041
DId you see the new lawyer?

776
01:33:01,801 --> 01:33:05,760
He was here...
he told me everything...

777
01:33:08,081 --> 01:33:11,721
-I will loose, right?
-Frankly, yes, you will.

778
01:33:11,721 --> 01:33:15,157
At least nothing happened to
Alicia during birth.

779
01:33:15,561 --> 01:33:19,713
It's the only thing that consoles
me and gives me hope.

780
01:33:21,441 --> 01:33:23,636
Are you ok, Benigno?

781
01:33:27,401 --> 01:33:30,871
I would like to hug you 
so much, Marco.

782
01:33:32,321 --> 01:33:35,881
But I have to ask for a meeting
face to face.

783
01:33:35,881 --> 01:33:37,917
I tried.

784
01:33:39,401 --> 01:33:42,359
They asked me whether you are
my lover.

785
01:33:42,521 --> 01:33:46,560
I didn't dare say 'yes' since
that would annoy you.

786
01:33:46,801 --> 01:33:51,113
It wouldn't annoy me at all.
You can say whatever you want.

787
01:33:51,441 --> 01:33:54,911
I have hugged very few people
in my life.

788
01:34:48,002 --> 01:34:49,833
Message!

789
01:34:53,802 --> 01:34:57,556
I was very happy to see you
and say goodbye today.

790
01:34:58,402 --> 01:35:00,962
They won't let me get
out of here...

791
01:35:00,962 --> 01:35:03,874
...or they will put me 
somewhere else

792
01:35:04,162 --> 01:35:06,802
I don't want to live 
without Alicia...

793
01:35:06,802 --> 01:35:10,431
...without being able to hold
not one pin of hers.

794
01:35:11,042 --> 01:35:13,351
Therefore I will escape.

795
01:35:13,642 --> 01:35:17,351
I didn't tell you so that you
won't stop me.

796
01:35:17,522 --> 01:35:20,036
I hug you firmly, Marco.

797
01:35:37,162 --> 01:35:40,074
In Zegovia...
Yes, in prison...

798
01:35:59,362 --> 01:36:02,672
I urgently need to see Benigno Martin.

799
01:36:02,962 --> 01:36:05,920
It's a matter of life and death.

800
01:36:06,202 --> 01:36:09,242
The warden is waiting for you
in his office.

801
01:36:09,242 --> 01:36:11,836
Me? Where is his office?

802
01:36:12,282 --> 01:36:14,796
The guard will accompany you.

803
01:36:21,882 --> 01:36:24,442
Empty your pockets, please.

804
01:36:37,522 --> 01:36:39,831
Wait, don't run.

805
01:36:45,762 --> 01:36:47,673
In there at the end.

806
01:36:49,122 --> 01:36:52,194
Good morning. I am
Marco Zuloaga.

807
01:36:52,842 --> 01:36:56,118
Benigno Martin left this
letter for you.

808
01:37:03,322 --> 01:37:05,522
Dear Marco...

809
01:37:05,522 --> 01:37:09,481
It's still raining, and this
is a good sign.

810
01:37:10,802 --> 01:37:14,351
When Alicia had the accident,
it was raining too.

811
01:37:14,842 --> 01:37:18,522
I am writing to you a few 
minutes before I escape.

812
01:37:18,522 --> 01:37:22,042
I hope, with all these,
to fall in a coma as well...

813
01:37:22,042 --> 01:37:24,237
...and to be near her.

814
01:37:24,962 --> 01:37:27,430
You are my only friend.

815
01:37:27,882 --> 01:37:31,670
I am leaving you the house
I prepared for me and her.

816
01:37:33,522 --> 01:37:37,834
Wherever they take me, come to
see me and talk to me.

817
01:37:38,402 --> 01:37:42,111
Tell me everything, without
hiding anything.

818
01:37:42,922 --> 01:37:45,117
Goodbye, my friend.

819
01:38:02,322 --> 01:38:06,076
I took these from him and these
I found at his cell.

820
01:38:14,642 --> 01:38:16,917
You must sign here.

821
01:38:25,962 --> 01:38:28,078
Benigno, it's me.

822
01:38:30,522 --> 01:38:34,879
Alicia is alive...
You woke her up.

823
01:38:38,482 --> 01:38:42,634
I got your message and ran
immediately to tell you...

824
01:38:42,882 --> 01:38:45,316
...but it was too late.

825
01:38:45,442 --> 01:38:48,878
I put a pin of Alicia 
in your pocket.

826
01:38:50,842 --> 01:38:53,402
And a photo of hers.

827
01:38:54,162 --> 01:38:57,154
And a photo of your mother.

828
01:38:58,002 --> 01:39:01,278
So that they can be with you 
in eternity.

829
01:40:22,922 --> 01:40:26,551
Like wild waves. The male on top,
the female below.

830
01:40:26,842 --> 01:40:28,514
I will bring some water.

831
01:40:56,642 --> 01:40:58,553
Are you ok?

832
01:41:01,402 --> 01:41:03,358
I don't know...

833
01:41:05,762 --> 01:41:08,117
I am much better now.

834
01:41:20,882 --> 01:41:23,316
Come on, lets go inside.

835
01:41:28,322 --> 01:41:30,313
You tremble.

836
01:41:31,922 --> 01:41:33,401
Why?

837
01:41:44,322 --> 01:41:46,682
-What did you tell her?
-Noting.

838
01:41:46,682 --> 01:41:48,682
I saw you talking.

839
01:41:48,682 --> 01:41:52,038
She asked if I am ok, and I 
thanked her.

840
01:41:53,882 --> 01:41:58,319
You will see me around.
I live near the dancing school.

841
01:41:59,042 --> 01:42:01,875
In Benigno's place?

842
01:42:02,482 --> 01:42:05,872
-Why do you stay there?
-Benigno is dead.

843
01:42:10,922 --> 01:42:14,073

844
01:42:14,402 --> 01:42:17,838

845
01:42:18,162 --> 01:42:20,153
Nothing is simple.

846
01:42:20,562 --> 01:42:23,634
I am a dancing teacher,
and nothing is simple.
