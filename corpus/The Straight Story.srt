1
00:03:09,914 --> 00:03:10,915
Hey, Rose.

2
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:14,127
Hey, Dorothy.

3
00:05:19,074 --> 00:05:23,119
I'm gonna go over there.

4
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:36,132
We're waitin'.

5
00:05:55,241 --> 00:05:56,784
Alvin.

6
00:05:57,034 --> 00:05:59,286
Alvin Straight!

7
00:05:59,537 --> 00:06:04,297
Rose left a couple of hours ago.

8
00:06:04,548 --> 00:06:09,219
Did you hear me hollerin' for
Rose? I wasn't lookin' for Rose.

9
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:13,890
- I haven't seen Alvin today.
- Did I ask?

10
00:06:14,141 --> 00:06:17,519
Straight, you're late!

11
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:32,331
Alvin!

12
00:06:35,251 --> 00:06:38,671
Alvin!

13
00:06:39,922 --> 00:06:41,382
Alvin!

14
00:06:41,632 --> 00:06:44,761
- Come in, Bud.
- What the... Alvin?!

15
00:06:46,262 --> 00:06:48,347
Where the hell are you?

16
00:06:48,598 --> 00:06:51,100
I can't see a thing.

17
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:54,610
Over here, Bud. Watch your step.

18
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,737
What the hell's going on?

19
00:06:56,987 --> 00:07:00,949
What are you doin'
layin' on the floor? You nuts?

20
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,745
Supposed to be down
at Davmar's one hour ago.

21
00:07:04,995 --> 00:07:06,330
What's going on?

22
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:09,083
Oh, my God!

23
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:10,667
Hey, Dorothy.

24
00:07:10,918 --> 00:07:13,504
What's the number for 911?

25
00:07:13,754 --> 00:07:16,423
- No, Dorothy.
- What you doin'?

26
00:07:16,673 --> 00:07:20,600
I'll call the bar
and tell 'em we're not comin'.

27
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:24,479
Are you crazy?
We have a stricken man here.

28
00:07:24,729 --> 00:07:27,107
Are you stricken, Alvin?

29
00:07:27,357 --> 00:07:30,276
Put the phone down!

30
00:07:30,527 --> 00:07:34,155
Dad, what's all the yellin'?

31
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:38,785
Wh-what... uh,
have you done to my dad?

32
00:07:39,035 --> 00:07:40,787
Oh, for cry eye!

33
00:07:41,037 --> 00:07:42,878
Dad?

34
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,922
Are you OK, Dad?

35
00:07:45,172 --> 00:07:50,261
I just need a little help
gettin' up, honey.

36
00:08:18,295 --> 00:08:21,339
I'm goin' to Davmar's.
I'll be right back.

37
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:24,342
OK, Bud.

38
00:08:33,566 --> 00:08:34,776
I'm not goin'.

39
00:08:35,026 --> 00:08:36,360
Dad.

40
00:08:36,611 --> 00:08:37,612
I'm not goin'.

41
00:08:37,862 --> 00:08:41,616
You promised me, Dad.

42
00:08:55,838 --> 00:08:59,807
OK, Mr Straight,
put this robe on.

43
00:09:00,057 --> 00:09:04,019
Just bring me the doctor.

44
00:09:29,384 --> 00:09:32,971
You like birds.

45
00:09:34,097 --> 00:09:38,560
I build... uh, birdhouses...
uh, for bluebirds.

46
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:41,271
Oh, that's nice.

47
00:09:41,521 --> 00:09:45,316
Yeah, it's Pete... uh,
Pete sells my...

48
00:09:45,567 --> 00:09:48,701
uh, birdhouses...
at the Ace Hardware.

49
00:09:48,951 --> 00:09:52,496
- I'll look for them next time.
- Yeah?

50
00:09:52,746 --> 00:09:54,832
No operation.

51
00:09:55,082 --> 00:09:59,545
This morning you fall and can't
get up, that's your hips, Alvin.

52
00:09:59,795 --> 00:10:01,881
And you'll need a walker now.

53
00:10:02,131 --> 00:10:03,340
No walker.

54
00:10:03,591 --> 00:10:06,343
Fine, a second cane, then.

55
00:10:06,594 --> 00:10:08,679
You say you're having
trouble seeing.

56
00:10:08,929 --> 00:10:11,390
That could be
a diabetes-related problem.

57
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,815
I'd like to run some tests.

58
00:10:14,065 --> 00:10:17,068
No tests and no X-rays.

59
00:10:17,319 --> 00:10:22,115
Well, I see and hear
that you smoke.

60
00:10:22,365 --> 00:10:25,994
My guess is you're in the early
stages of emphysema.

61
00:10:26,244 --> 00:10:28,789
And Alvin,
you have circulation problems

62
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:31,875
and I'm worried
about your diet.

63
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:35,796
If you don't
make some changes quickly,

64
00:10:36,046 --> 00:10:40,056
there will be
some serious consequences.

65
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:31,411
It... has a... a red roof.

66
00:11:31,661 --> 00:11:34,205
Another pretty one, Rose.

67
00:11:34,455 --> 00:11:37,584
I want to... uh,
paint the... uh, next one blue.

68
00:11:37,834 --> 00:11:41,004
That's a good idea.

69
00:11:47,385 --> 00:11:52,223
What... uh, did the doctor say?

70
00:11:53,814 --> 00:11:59,069
He said
I was gonna live to be 100.

71
00:12:33,443 --> 00:12:36,530
I think I'll go
and mow the lawn.

72
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:39,783
Uh, I can... uh,
cut it for you, Dad.

73
00:12:40,033 --> 00:12:43,209
I got it, sweetheart.

74
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:20,836
God darn!

75
00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:44,032
No, we'll...
we won't be mowin' today.

76
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:47,202
Storm's comin' in.

77
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:48,912
Yeah.

78
00:13:59,011 --> 00:14:00,679
I love a lightnin' storm.

79
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:04,141
Uh, me too, Dad.

80
00:14:25,502 --> 00:14:28,463
Hello?

81
00:14:28,547 --> 00:14:31,925
This is... is Rose.

82
00:14:32,175 --> 00:14:36,638
Yeah... Yeah... Uh-huh.

83
00:14:36,888 --> 00:14:39,224
Oh, no...

84
00:14:39,474 --> 00:14:42,519
When?

85
00:14:42,644 --> 00:14:45,272
OK... right... right...

86
00:14:45,522 --> 00:14:47,232
I'll tell him.

87
00:14:47,482 --> 00:14:52,451
Yeah... OK... Bye.

88
00:14:59,792 --> 00:15:03,462
Uh, that was... Bobby.

89
00:15:03,713 --> 00:15:06,883
Uncle Lyle... had a...

90
00:15:07,133 --> 00:15:08,217
...a stroke.

91
00:15:16,231 --> 00:15:19,401
Dad?

92
00:15:44,641 --> 00:15:47,060
No, Bobby,
he... he didn't say much.

93
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:48,353
Uh, they've both...

94
00:15:48,603 --> 00:15:49,646
uh, been so...

95
00:15:49,896 --> 00:15:52,857
uh, stubborn.

96
00:15:53,233 --> 00:15:55,568
No, no,
it was longer, I remember.

97
00:15:55,818 --> 00:16:01,699
It was... uh, July, uh, 7th,
19... 88, uh, Bobby.

98
00:16:02,158 --> 00:16:06,001
I always... remember the dates.

99
00:16:07,253 --> 00:16:10,214
Yeah.

100
00:16:12,258 --> 00:16:16,470
I don't know... uh,
what he'll do.

101
00:17:20,218 --> 00:17:23,597
Rose, darlin'?

102
00:17:24,932 --> 00:17:26,350
Rose?

103
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,770
I'm gonna go back on the road.

104
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:33,607
I've gotta go see Lyle.

105
00:17:35,108 --> 00:17:37,903
But, Dad...

106
00:17:38,612 --> 00:17:41,865
How are you...?

107
00:17:43,414 --> 00:17:48,002
Well, I... haven't quite
got that figured yet.

108
00:18:03,142 --> 00:18:05,395
One, your eyes are bad.

109
00:18:05,645 --> 00:18:08,487
That's why you don't...
uh, drive your car.

110
00:18:08,737 --> 00:18:12,533
Uh, two, Uncle Lyle...
uh, lives in... uh, Wisconsin,

111
00:18:12,783 --> 00:18:16,203
which is... uh, 317 miles away.

112
00:18:16,453 --> 00:18:20,416
You would have to... uh,
stay all night... in Des Moines.

113
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:24,503
Then there's no...
uh, bus... to Zion.

114
00:18:24,753 --> 00:18:28,007
Three, your... uh, hips are bad.

115
00:18:28,257 --> 00:18:30,384
You can hardly... uh, stand...

116
00:18:30,634 --> 00:18:34,436
for two minutes... And
when you... uh, do stand up...

117
00:18:34,686 --> 00:18:38,064
this... is the sound you make...

118
00:18:38,315 --> 00:18:40,984
when you... stand.

119
00:18:49,117 --> 00:18:53,413
Uh, four, uh,
you are... uh, 73 years old...

120
00:18:53,663 --> 00:18:55,081
You were... uh, born

121
00:18:55,332 --> 00:19:02,136
when, uh, Calvin... uh, Coolidge
was president... of America.

122
00:19:02,386 --> 00:19:06,390
Uh, you are...
uh, 73 years old, Dad.

123
00:19:06,641 --> 00:19:10,770
And... I cannot drive you there.

124
00:19:10,853 --> 00:19:14,857
Rose, darlin', I'm not dead yet.

125
00:19:18,361 --> 00:19:22,788
Uh, what are we...
uh, building, Dad?

126
00:19:23,538 --> 00:19:25,082
Havin' a party?

127
00:19:25,332 --> 00:19:29,002
Oh, jeez...
I love... uh, parties.

128
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:31,171
Oh, me too.

129
00:19:31,421 --> 00:19:32,965
And so... where's it at?

130
00:19:33,215 --> 00:19:34,508
Where's what at?

131
00:19:34,758 --> 00:19:39,429
Your... uh, party.

132
00:19:40,097 --> 00:19:42,266
I'm not havin' a party.

133
00:19:42,516 --> 00:19:45,477
I thought
YOU were havin' a party.

134
00:19:45,727 --> 00:19:47,062
I am?

135
00:19:47,312 --> 00:19:50,405
Well, yeah.
Look at all that Braunschweiger.

136
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:53,241
Oh, yeah,
it's a lot of Braunschweiger.

137
00:19:53,491 --> 00:19:56,286
It's... uh, for my dad,
uh, for his... his trip.

138
00:19:56,536 --> 00:19:58,997
Uh, my dad...
he's going to... uh, Wisconsin.

139
00:19:59,247 --> 00:20:02,709
I... asked him how
he's... uh, going to get there...

140
00:20:02,959 --> 00:20:05,503
Uh... but he...
uh, won't say nothing.

141
00:20:05,753 --> 00:20:09,674
Wisconsin?
That is a real party state.

142
00:20:09,924 --> 00:20:12,891
Yeah.

143
00:20:12,975 --> 00:20:17,605
I... uh, hate...
uh, Braun... uh... schweiger.

144
00:20:19,189 --> 00:20:22,234
Yeah.

145
00:20:46,056 --> 00:20:51,394
Alvin, you've got three
five-gallon cans there.

146
00:20:52,103 --> 00:20:54,439
15 gallons of gas.

147
00:20:54,689 --> 00:20:57,984
What do you need
so much gas for, Alvin?

148
00:20:58,234 --> 00:21:01,571
Sig, you're one nosey
son of a gun.

149
00:21:01,821 --> 00:21:04,330
You got that right.

150
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:08,000
- I wanna buy that.
- What?

151
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:11,337
The grabber.

152
00:21:16,133 --> 00:21:17,843
Oh, jeez, Alvin.

153
00:21:18,094 --> 00:21:23,307
- That's MY grabber, Alvin.
- Well?

154
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:31,947
Oh, jeez, Alvin. I don't...
I... I do have two of them...

155
00:21:32,197 --> 00:21:34,408
I think five dollars is right.

156
00:21:34,658 --> 00:21:38,954
That's a darn good grabber,
Alvin.

157
00:21:39,204 --> 00:21:40,664
- I... I...
- Well?

158
00:21:40,914 --> 00:21:43,166
They're hard to come by, Alvin.

159
00:21:43,417 --> 00:21:49,840
It's gonna take me two months
to get another one on order.

160
00:21:56,686 --> 00:21:59,647
Jeez, Alvin, ten dollars.

161
00:21:59,897 --> 00:22:03,192
Ring her up.

162
00:22:37,274 --> 00:22:41,278
What do you need
that grabber for, Alvin?

163
00:22:41,528 --> 00:22:44,329
Grabbin'.

164
00:23:36,643 --> 00:23:39,604
Oh, jeez, Dad.

165
00:23:39,938 --> 00:23:43,775
Oh, jeez, Dad.

166
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:03,384
Listen to that
old grain elevator.

167
00:24:04,218 --> 00:24:08,931
It's... uh, harvest time.

168
00:24:18,024 --> 00:24:22,195
Uh, that... uh, trailer is too
h-heavy for... for that.

169
00:24:22,445 --> 00:24:25,579
It's a lawn mower.
You're going to...

170
00:24:25,829 --> 00:24:31,085
...drive a... a lawn mower
to another state?

171
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:38,759
Rosie, I've...
I've gotta go see Lyle.

172
00:24:39,009 --> 00:24:43,055
And I... I've gotta make
this trip on my own.

173
00:24:43,305 --> 00:24:47,561
I know you understand.

174
00:24:51,695 --> 00:24:54,656
I guess so.

175
00:25:05,041 --> 00:25:09,045
Look up at the sky, Rosie.

176
00:25:20,021 --> 00:25:25,234
The sky is sure full
of stars tonight.

177
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:50,223
Crimenetto, it's Alvin
and he's driving his lawn mower.

178
00:25:56,897 --> 00:26:01,068
Alvin! What are you settin' out
to do here?

179
00:26:01,318 --> 00:26:02,655
For cry eye, Alvin!

180
00:26:02,909 --> 00:26:06,120
Alvin, you're gonna get blown
right off the road,

181
00:26:06,371 --> 00:26:09,499
that's what I'm afraid!

182
00:26:18,174 --> 00:26:22,595
He'll never make it
past The Grotto.

183
00:31:22,592 --> 00:31:24,844
I'm havin'
a little engine trouble.

184
00:31:25,095 --> 00:31:28,145
What the heck is that
you're driving there?

185
00:31:28,395 --> 00:31:33,109
It's a Rehds. Could you
give me a lift into town?

186
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:37,905
Yeah, to The Grotto. This
is the Sun Ray Tour. Get in.

187
00:31:38,155 --> 00:31:44,245
- I'll get you help there.
- I'd appreciate that.

188
00:32:02,352 --> 00:32:06,356
My Edward loved
his riding mower.

189
00:32:38,478 --> 00:32:42,609
Hey, come here, hurry. Hurry up.

190
00:32:56,376 --> 00:32:59,338
Poor Alvin.

191
00:33:06,762 --> 00:33:11,481
So the man... in a... pick-up,
he brought my dad back.

192
00:33:11,731 --> 00:33:17,612
Ohh... mm, I must've been
at the beauty shop.

193
00:33:19,364 --> 00:33:22,534
What kinda pick-up?

194
00:33:40,182 --> 00:33:43,352
A Ford.

195
00:33:43,686 --> 00:33:46,647
But what's your dad doin'
with that gun?

196
00:33:46,897 --> 00:33:50,192
I don't know.

197
00:33:57,618 --> 00:34:00,834
I gave you that old Rehds
last time, right?

198
00:34:01,084 --> 00:34:02,544
That you did.

199
00:34:02,794 --> 00:34:08,175
- You tradin' in that Rehds now?
- No, I don't believe I will.

200
00:34:08,425 --> 00:34:12,888
Pete told me you used that rider
in a real interestin' way.

201
00:34:13,138 --> 00:34:16,766
- You still plannin' to do that?
- Yeah, Tom.

202
00:34:17,017 --> 00:34:22,397
I know not to talk you out of
somethin' you set your mind to,

203
00:34:22,649 --> 00:34:25,907
but Alvin, you've always
struck me as smart.

204
00:34:26,157 --> 00:34:27,992
Well, that's appreciated.

205
00:34:28,242 --> 00:34:29,702
Until now.

206
00:34:37,251 --> 00:34:38,252
What year?

207
00:34:38,503 --> 00:34:39,587
'66.

208
00:34:39,837 --> 00:34:42,882
Kohler engine.
We've used it for parts

209
00:34:43,132 --> 00:34:46,344
but I always replace them.
The guts are good.

210
00:34:46,594 --> 00:34:50,270
It's got the old transmission.
Nothing fancy.

211
00:34:50,521 --> 00:34:53,732
- Is it a good machine?
- It's good.

212
00:34:53,982 --> 00:34:57,236
Tom, I got $325.

213
00:34:57,486 --> 00:34:58,904
That's a fact.

214
00:34:59,154 --> 00:35:03,367
Sounds good to me, Alvin.
Let's go settle up with Alice.

215
00:35:03,617 --> 00:35:06,495
One more thing,
sometime you can find out

216
00:35:06,745 --> 00:35:10,374
about these old machines,
if you know who run 'em.

217
00:35:10,624 --> 00:35:14,717
- Do you know who owned it?
- You bet... Me.

218
00:35:14,968 --> 00:35:17,720
All right.

219
00:38:46,686 --> 00:38:50,690
I couldn't get a ride.

220
00:38:54,902 --> 00:38:56,654
Are you hungry?

221
00:38:56,904 --> 00:38:59,830
Whaddaya got?

222
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:03,292
Weeners.

223
00:39:04,084 --> 00:39:05,586
Weeners?

224
00:39:05,836 --> 00:39:10,215
Weeners. Wanna try one?

225
00:39:26,779 --> 00:39:30,909
Here's a good stick for you.

226
00:40:07,409 --> 00:40:09,203
What a hunk of junk.

227
00:40:09,453 --> 00:40:13,546
Eat your dinner, missy.

228
00:41:05,819 --> 00:41:10,365
So... how long you been
out on the road?

229
00:41:10,616 --> 00:41:15,037
Well, I been travellin'
most of my life.

230
00:41:15,287 --> 00:41:18,582
Where you from?

231
00:41:18,832 --> 00:41:21,793
Laurens.

232
00:41:23,170 --> 00:41:28,431
Got a wife back there? Kids?

233
00:41:28,598 --> 00:41:33,728
My wife, Francis delivered
14 babies. Seven of 'em made it.

234
00:41:33,978 --> 00:41:38,566
My daughter,
Rose lives with me.

235
00:41:40,401 --> 00:41:44,572
Francis died in '81.

236
00:41:50,995 --> 00:41:54,838
Where's your family?

237
00:41:57,883 --> 00:42:01,262
Are you runnin' away?

238
00:42:09,144 --> 00:42:12,731
How far along are ya?

239
00:42:15,859 --> 00:42:19,202
Five months.

240
00:42:32,132 --> 00:42:36,970
Well, I'm headin'
to see my brother Lyle.

241
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:39,723
Huh?

242
00:42:39,973 --> 00:42:46,319
I said I'm goin' to see
my brother Lyle in Mount Zion.

243
00:42:46,485 --> 00:42:49,238
- Where's that?
- Wisconsin.

244
00:42:49,488 --> 00:42:52,617
- Oh...
- Just across the state line.

245
00:42:52,867 --> 00:42:53,868
Cheddar Heads.

246
00:42:55,369 --> 00:42:57,163
Aren't those the dumbest things

247
00:42:57,413 --> 00:43:00,625
you ever seen somebody
stick on their head?

248
00:43:00,875 --> 00:43:06,547
I hear that's
a real party place - Wisconsin.

249
00:43:09,932 --> 00:43:14,394
Guess I'll never
get to find out.

250
00:43:19,983 --> 00:43:22,653
There's a blanket
in the trailer.

251
00:43:22,903 --> 00:43:27,324
Why don't you go get it?

252
00:44:12,423 --> 00:44:16,093
My family hates me.

253
00:44:19,179 --> 00:44:24,190
They'll really hate me
when they find out.

254
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:27,777
You didn't tell 'em?

255
00:44:28,028 --> 00:44:32,866
No. No one knows.
Not even my boyfriend.

256
00:44:41,124 --> 00:44:43,627
Well, they may be mad,

257
00:44:43,877 --> 00:44:48,011
but I don't think they're
mad enough to wanna lose you

258
00:44:48,262 --> 00:44:50,890
or your little problem.

259
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:53,142
I don't know about that.

260
00:44:53,392 --> 00:44:58,314
Well, of course, neither do I,
but a warm bed and a roof

261
00:44:58,564 --> 00:45:03,027
sounds a might better
than eatin' a hot dog on a stick

262
00:45:02,756 --> 00:45:08,053
with an old geezer that's
travellin' on a lawn mower.

263
00:45:14,796 --> 00:45:17,173
My daughter Rose is...

264
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:21,594
Some people call her
a little bit slow but she's not.

265
00:45:21,844 --> 00:45:28,142
She's got a mind
like a bear trap for facts.

266
00:45:28,434 --> 00:45:33,022
She keeps everything
organised around the house.

267
00:45:33,273 --> 00:45:35,566
She was a real good mom.

268
00:45:35,817 --> 00:45:38,575
She had four kids.

269
00:45:38,826 --> 00:45:43,956
One night, somebody else
was watchin' the kids

270
00:45:44,206 --> 00:45:47,418
and there was a fire.

271
00:45:47,668 --> 00:45:51,714
Her second boy
got burned real bad.

272
00:45:51,964 --> 00:45:55,259
Rose had nothin'
to do with it but, ah...

273
00:45:55,509 --> 00:45:59,221
...on account of the way Rose is,
the State figured

274
00:45:59,471 --> 00:46:02,728
she wasn't competent
to take care of them kids

275
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:06,067
and they took 'em all
away from her.

276
00:46:06,318 --> 00:46:13,199
There isn't a day goes by that
she don't pine for them kids.

277
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:35,353
When my kids were real little,
I used to play a game with 'em.

278
00:46:35,603 --> 00:46:38,898
I'd give each one
of 'em a stick and -

279
00:46:39,148 --> 00:46:43,694
one for each one of 'em -
then I'd say "you break that".

280
00:46:43,945 --> 00:46:46,238
'Course they could, real easy.

281
00:46:46,489 --> 00:46:51,953
Then I'd say "tie them sticks in
a bundle and try to break that".

282
00:46:52,203 --> 00:46:58,048
'Course they couldn't.
Then I'd say "that bundle...

283
00:46:58,298 --> 00:47:01,259
...that's family."

284
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,908
Why don't you sleep
in the trailer?

285
00:47:19,158 --> 00:47:23,496
This chair's just fine
for me tonight.

286
00:47:23,746 --> 00:47:27,625
No, I'll be fine
sleepin' out here.

287
00:47:27,875 --> 00:47:32,714
Lookin' at the stars
helps me think.

288
00:47:33,381 --> 00:47:36,342
Well...

289
00:47:53,449 --> 00:47:56,243
Thank you.

290
00:50:52,712 --> 00:50:55,506
Woo!

291
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:16,516
What the...?

292
00:53:18,810 --> 00:53:21,646
What the hell?

293
00:53:49,639 --> 00:53:51,808
Hey, how're you doin'?

294
00:53:52,058 --> 00:53:54,852
Doin' good.

295
00:54:37,532 --> 00:54:38,783
Hey, Irene.

296
00:54:39,033 --> 00:54:43,329
You don't think about
gettin' old when you're young.

297
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:46,750
You shouldn't.

298
00:54:54,513 --> 00:54:57,141
Must be something good
about gettin' old.

299
00:54:57,391 --> 00:55:03,647
Well, I can't imagine anything
good about being blind and lame

300
00:55:03,898 --> 00:55:05,941
at the same time, but... still

301
00:55:06,192 --> 00:55:11,739
at my age, I've seen about all
that life has to dish out.

302
00:55:11,989 --> 00:55:14,915
I know to separate the wheat

303
00:55:15,165 --> 00:55:21,797
from the chaff and let
the small stuff fall away.

304
00:55:23,673 --> 00:55:26,843
Let's go, man.

305
00:55:27,719 --> 00:55:33,016
So, ah... what's the worst part
about being old, Alvin?

306
00:55:33,767 --> 00:55:41,030
The worst part of being old is
rememberin' when you was young.

307
00:57:39,381 --> 00:57:41,216
Can I help you, lady?

308
00:57:41,466 --> 00:57:45,518
No, you can't help me.
No one can help me.

309
00:57:45,768 --> 00:57:49,981
I've tried driving with my
lights on, sounding my horn!

310
00:57:50,231 --> 00:57:54,986
I scream, I roll the window down
and bang on the door

311
00:57:55,236 --> 00:57:58,281
and play Public Enemy real loud!

312
00:57:58,531 --> 00:58:02,243
I've prayed to St Francis
of Assisi, St Christopher too!

313
00:58:02,493 --> 00:58:06,289
What the heck! I've tried
everything and still every week

314
00:58:06,539 --> 00:58:08,714
I hit at least one deer!

315
00:58:08,964 --> 00:58:14,970
I have hit 13 deer in seven
weeks driving down this road!

316
00:58:15,220 --> 00:58:20,476
And I HAVE to drive
down this road every day,

317
00:58:20,726 --> 00:58:22,978
40 miles to work and back.

318
00:58:23,228 --> 00:58:30,944
I HAVE to drive to work
and I HAVE to drive home!

319
00:58:33,495 --> 00:58:37,081
Where do they come from?

320
00:58:48,218 --> 00:58:51,012
Oh... he's dead.

321
00:58:54,390 --> 00:58:57,940
And I LOVE deer.

322
01:01:08,352 --> 01:01:13,107
Well, they sure picked the right
place to practise a burn on.

323
01:01:26,787 --> 01:01:32,465
That Rumelthanger place
was an eyesore.

324
01:02:15,806 --> 01:02:18,021
What do you suppose...?

325
01:02:18,273 --> 01:02:22,027
Is that a lawn mower?

326
01:02:51,896 --> 01:02:55,483
Mister, you OK?

327
01:03:00,822 --> 01:03:06,452
Jeez, mister, you're lucky
she didn't roll on you.

328
01:03:12,381 --> 01:03:14,216
I guess the belt broke.

329
01:03:14,466 --> 01:03:16,552
I wouldn't be surprised.

330
01:03:16,802 --> 01:03:19,889
You don't have brakes
on that trailer, right?

331
01:03:20,139 --> 01:03:22,975
I worked for John Deere
for 30 years,

332
01:03:23,225 --> 01:03:26,896
you shouldn't be hauling a rig
behind a mower.

333
01:03:27,146 --> 01:03:30,024
At least not down
a hill like that.

334
01:03:30,274 --> 01:03:32,863
I'm Danny Riordan.

335
01:03:33,115 --> 01:03:35,619
Alvin Straight.

336
01:03:35,869 --> 01:03:40,207
Alvin, let's get you
and this rig off the road

337
01:03:40,457 --> 01:03:44,878
and see what the damage is.

338
01:03:55,764 --> 01:03:59,774
Let's get this off the road.

339
01:03:59,857 --> 01:04:03,528
Sure you're OK?

340
01:04:38,735 --> 01:04:41,071
OK.

341
01:04:41,321 --> 01:04:45,492
You OK? Everything all right?
I'm going back to the exercise.

342
01:04:45,742 --> 01:04:49,460
Thanks. Appreciate it.

343
01:04:54,090 --> 01:04:58,720
Well... let's
take a look at this mower.

344
01:04:58,970 --> 01:05:04,893
- This is what '65, '66?
- '66.

345
01:05:09,731 --> 01:05:12,442
Well... tell you right now,
Alvin,

346
01:05:12,694 --> 01:05:14,992
you won't be going
anywhere tonight.

347
01:05:15,242 --> 01:05:18,204
Aside from your, ah,
drive belt being busted,

348
01:05:18,454 --> 01:05:20,789
you got transmission problems.

349
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:24,168
- Where you headed?
- Mount Zion.

350
01:05:24,418 --> 01:05:27,296
Mount Zion, Wisconsin?
Past Prairie du Chien?

351
01:05:27,546 --> 01:05:29,757
That's 60 more miles of hills.

352
01:05:30,007 --> 01:05:31,675
That's across the Mississippi.

353
01:05:31,926 --> 01:05:34,136
What's in Mount Zion, Alvin?

354
01:05:34,386 --> 01:05:35,930
My brother lives there.

355
01:05:36,180 --> 01:05:40,357
- Why didn't you take your car?
- I'm not licensed.

356
01:05:40,607 --> 01:05:44,569
- Couldn't he visit?
- He's had a bad stroke.

357
01:05:44,819 --> 01:05:47,864
Where are you coming from?

358
01:05:48,114 --> 01:05:49,741
Back a piece.

359
01:05:49,991 --> 01:05:52,118
West Union?

360
01:05:52,369 --> 01:05:55,747
- Hawkeye?
- Nope.

361
01:05:55,956 --> 01:05:59,918
Well, not New Hampton?
You haven't come that far.

362
01:06:00,168 --> 01:06:03,176
You've come a long ways,
haven't you?

363
01:06:03,427 --> 01:06:06,347
Yeah, I have. Laurens, Iowa.

364
01:06:06,597 --> 01:06:08,057
Laurens?!

365
01:06:08,307 --> 01:06:13,312
That's west of The Grotto. How
long have you been on the road?

366
01:06:13,563 --> 01:06:14,564
What's the date?

367
01:06:14,814 --> 01:06:17,775
October eighth.

368
01:06:20,778 --> 01:06:24,574
Five weeks. I left Laurens
on the fifth of September.

369
01:06:24,824 --> 01:06:28,039
You been bunkin' in that?

370
01:06:28,291 --> 01:06:30,919
That's my rollin' home.

371
01:06:31,169 --> 01:06:33,088
Where you been settin' up camp?

372
01:06:33,338 --> 01:06:37,759
In the fields. I pull off.
I don't travel at night.

373
01:06:38,010 --> 01:06:40,220
Haven't you been scared,
being alone?

374
01:06:40,470 --> 01:06:42,222
There are weird people
everywhere.

375
01:06:42,472 --> 01:06:48,020
Well, ma'am, I fought
in the trenches in World War II.

376
01:06:48,270 --> 01:06:51,356
Why should I be scared
of an Iowa cornfield?

377
01:06:51,607 --> 01:06:54,657
Well, um...

378
01:06:54,908 --> 01:06:58,786
till we get
this mower fixed...

379
01:06:58,953 --> 01:07:02,332
why don't you... ah,
bivouac in our yard here?

380
01:07:02,582 --> 01:07:05,793
There's a bathroom
in the garage you can use.

381
01:07:06,044 --> 01:07:08,379
Well, that's
awful generous of you

382
01:07:08,630 --> 01:07:14,594
and I'm sure my machine here
is agreeable to that too.

383
01:07:15,887 --> 01:07:19,480
Sure wanna thank you folks
for helping me today.

384
01:07:19,730 --> 01:07:21,982
There's a lot of rain forecast.

385
01:07:22,233 --> 01:07:25,653
Sure don't want to get stuck
in that trailer.

386
01:07:25,903 --> 01:07:30,282
I... I do a little woodwork.
I thought you'd like a few fish.

387
01:07:30,532 --> 01:07:33,410
My daughter does woodwork.
She makes birdhouses.

388
01:07:33,661 --> 01:07:36,830
Oh, that's nice.

389
01:07:41,835 --> 01:07:47,097
- You finished there?
- I believe I am.

390
01:09:14,285 --> 01:09:18,748
- I'm in need of a phone.
- Sure. Come in.

391
01:09:18,998 --> 01:09:22,712
I wanna tell my daughter
about my recent travels.

392
01:09:22,964 --> 01:09:24,385
Sure. Come in.

393
01:09:24,635 --> 01:09:29,640
If it's all the same with you,
do you have a cordless phone?

394
01:09:29,890 --> 01:09:36,230
- Door's wide open, come...
- I can call from out here.

395
01:09:43,862 --> 01:09:47,995
Here you go. You're welcome
to sit in the kitchen.

396
01:09:48,247 --> 01:09:51,459
We can leave, if you're
lookin' for privacy.

397
01:09:51,710 --> 01:09:56,298
Out here's fine.
Is the area code still 712 here?

398
01:09:56,548 --> 01:09:59,551
No, Alvin.
That hill rolled you into 319.

399
01:09:59,801 --> 01:10:03,263
You need to dial one
and your area code.

400
01:10:03,513 --> 01:10:06,474
712, thank you.

401
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:22,121
'Hello?'

402
01:10:22,371 --> 01:10:23,414
Rose?

403
01:10:23,664 --> 01:10:26,626
Dad? Dad...

404
01:10:28,002 --> 01:10:31,922
Uh, I'm... so glad to hear you.

405
01:10:37,931 --> 01:10:41,647
It's gonna cost him a bundle
to fix that mower.

406
01:10:41,897 --> 01:10:45,359
I don't think
he's got that kinda money.

407
01:10:45,609 --> 01:10:48,278
I wouldn't drive
that thing to Excelsior.

408
01:10:48,528 --> 01:10:51,114
It's a lawn mower,
for God's sake.

409
01:10:51,365 --> 01:10:55,953
Uh, your social security cheque?
Ah... it's here, Dad.

410
01:10:56,203 --> 01:10:58,830
Rose, can you send me my cheque?

411
01:10:59,081 --> 01:11:01,083
Uh, yeah.

412
01:11:01,333 --> 01:11:04,801
He's damn lucky
he made it down that hill.

413
01:11:05,051 --> 01:11:08,346
- He could've died easily.
- Yeah.

414
01:11:08,596 --> 01:11:10,390
He's none too strong.

415
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:14,060
See how he has to walk
with the canes?

416
01:11:14,310 --> 01:11:17,563
OK, Dad.

417
01:11:21,359 --> 01:11:25,321
I... I...

418
01:11:26,322 --> 01:11:30,874
OK, OK, Dad, OK.
I... I have a pencil, Dad.

419
01:11:31,125 --> 01:11:33,669
The hills just get worse

420
01:11:33,919 --> 01:11:38,340
the closer you get
to the Mississippi.

421
01:11:38,966 --> 01:11:41,385
Go ahead and drive him, honey.

422
01:11:41,635 --> 01:11:45,139
Mount Zion can't
be half a day. It's fine.

423
01:11:45,389 --> 01:11:48,392
You're a good man,
Danny Riordan.

424
01:11:48,642 --> 01:11:54,738
And that's why I married you,
despite what my mother said.

425
01:11:55,238 --> 01:11:56,239
Now, shoo!

426
01:11:56,489 --> 01:11:57,490
Dad?

427
01:11:57,741 --> 01:12:00,577
I miss you, Dad.

428
01:12:00,827 --> 01:12:02,370
I love you, Rosie.

429
01:12:02,620 --> 01:12:04,456
'I love you too, Dad.'

430
01:12:04,706 --> 01:12:07,500
Uh, bye, Dad.

431
01:12:07,751 --> 01:12:09,544
Bye... Dad.

432
01:12:13,089 --> 01:12:15,884
Ahem.

433
01:12:42,878 --> 01:12:45,092
What are you cookin'
there, Alvin?

434
01:12:45,342 --> 01:12:47,636
Oh, I'm makin'
my Mexican coffee.

435
01:12:47,886 --> 01:12:50,222
Ah. Mind if I join you?

436
01:12:50,472 --> 01:12:55,310
Get you a chair...
that iron one there.

437
01:12:56,812 --> 01:13:01,650
You'll be a guest
in your own back yard.

438
01:13:02,609 --> 01:13:08,286
Amm, I talked to the Olsen
twins, and, ah... they estimate

439
01:13:09,163 --> 01:13:13,334
it'll cost around 250 dollars
to get your mower fixed.

440
01:13:13,584 --> 01:13:16,504
Well, that's twice
what it oughta be,

441
01:13:16,754 --> 01:13:19,424
I guess it's cos
they're twins, huh?

442
01:13:21,342 --> 01:13:26,889
I'd be happy to drive you the
rest of the way to Mount Zion.

443
01:13:27,140 --> 01:13:31,310
Be a nice Sunday drive.
We enjoy crossin' the river,

444
01:13:31,561 --> 01:13:33,986
especially now
with the trees in colour.

445
01:13:34,236 --> 01:13:36,655
Well, I appreciate that, but...

446
01:13:36,905 --> 01:13:41,744
...I wanna finish this one
my own way.

447
01:13:52,087 --> 01:13:55,049
Try this.

448
01:13:58,433 --> 01:14:01,186
Thank you.

449
01:14:01,811 --> 01:14:04,898
Well, you know, Alvin,
there's a lotta hills

450
01:14:05,148 --> 01:14:07,734
bigger than Clairmont's
between here and Zion.

451
01:14:07,984 --> 01:14:10,904
Even if you get that mower
runnin' again,

452
01:14:11,154 --> 01:14:13,156
it may still break down.

453
01:14:13,406 --> 01:14:17,702
Well, you're a kind man
talkin' to a stubborn man.

454
01:14:17,952 --> 01:14:22,877
I still wanna finish this
the way I started.

455
01:14:25,424 --> 01:14:27,760
No, no...

456
01:14:28,010 --> 01:14:29,011
Hi, Verlyn.

457
01:14:29,261 --> 01:14:32,264
- How the heck you doin'?
- Fine.

458
01:14:32,515 --> 01:14:33,641
Wonderful.

459
01:14:33,891 --> 01:14:36,852
He's there.

460
01:14:48,118 --> 01:14:51,248
Well... they gave you
a plate of her brownies.

461
01:14:51,498 --> 01:14:53,166
Yeah.

462
01:14:53,417 --> 01:14:54,918
How's that for timing?

463
01:14:55,168 --> 01:14:57,003
Janet makes the best brownies...

464
01:14:57,254 --> 01:14:58,839
...in Lafayette county.

465
01:14:59,089 --> 01:15:02,592
She won prizes every year
at the county fair.

466
01:15:02,843 --> 01:15:06,930
- Mmm... help yourself.
- Thank you.

467
01:15:09,933 --> 01:15:13,735
Mmm... I've been doin' errands
and I'm heading for a beer.

468
01:15:13,985 --> 01:15:16,529
I thought you'd like
to join me.

469
01:15:16,779 --> 01:15:18,865
Well, I don't drink
any more, but...

470
01:15:19,115 --> 01:15:22,076
I'm always up for a change
of scenery.

471
01:15:22,326 --> 01:15:25,121
Well, come on.

472
01:15:32,045 --> 01:15:35,590
Well, I'm ridin' a little higher
and a little faster.

473
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:38,724
Except when you came down
that hill.

474
01:15:47,691 --> 01:15:51,612
I picked up a mournful taste
for liquor in France.

475
01:15:51,862 --> 01:15:55,449
When I came back,
I couldn't drink enough of it.

476
01:15:55,699 --> 01:16:02,373
I wasn't worth a stick
of stove wood... I was mean.

477
01:16:03,755 --> 01:16:06,424
A preacher helped me
put some distance

478
01:16:06,674 --> 01:16:10,804
between me and the bottle.
And he helped me see...

479
01:16:11,054 --> 01:16:15,642
the reason I was drinkin', I was
seein' all them things here,

480
01:16:15,892 --> 01:16:19,521
that I'd seen over there.

481
01:16:23,692 --> 01:16:28,536
# Though things may look very
dark, your dream is not... #

482
01:16:28,786 --> 01:16:33,124
Lots of men came back
drinkin' hard.

483
01:16:34,333 --> 01:16:38,546
Well... everyone
tryin' to forget.

484
01:16:38,796 --> 01:16:44,051
I can see it
in a man right away.

485
01:16:45,344 --> 01:16:47,263
Yup.

486
01:16:47,513 --> 01:16:51,100
# The rainbow,
you will suddenly... #

487
01:17:04,828 --> 01:17:07,998
There was one time...

488
01:17:08,790 --> 01:17:11,960
when we just...

489
01:17:12,252 --> 01:17:18,220
Were waiting for
the first warm meal in ten days.

490
01:17:23,770 --> 01:17:27,648
We... thought
we'd seen the worst.

491
01:17:28,983 --> 01:17:33,905
We hadn't had
much trouble from the air.

492
01:17:35,823 --> 01:17:37,950
I was on the rise...

493
01:17:38,201 --> 01:17:41,370
with the quartermaster,

494
01:17:41,621 --> 01:17:46,882
workin' on more coffee
for me and my buddies.

495
01:17:47,591 --> 01:17:51,804
A stray Fokker
came over the treetops...

496
01:17:52,054 --> 01:17:55,474
and dropped
an incendiary on the mess tent.

497
01:17:57,226 --> 01:18:00,396
All my buddies...

498
01:18:00,729 --> 01:18:06,819
The Kraut banked right in front
of me on that hill...

499
01:18:07,236 --> 01:18:11,871
and now I can...
see the... Swastika.

500
01:18:24,092 --> 01:18:27,637
That is one thing
that I can't shake loose...

501
01:18:27,887 --> 01:18:32,518
All my buddies faces
are still young.

502
01:18:33,816 --> 01:18:39,321
And the thing is, the more years
I have, the more they've lost.

503
01:18:41,073 --> 01:18:44,493
And it's not always buddies
faces that I see,

504
01:18:44,744 --> 01:18:48,247
sometime they're German faces.

505
01:18:50,374 --> 01:18:55,796
Near the end we were shootin'
moon-faced boys.

506
01:19:00,432 --> 01:19:02,184
I was a sniper.

507
01:19:02,434 --> 01:19:07,022
Where I grew up, you learned
how to shoot to hunt food.

508
01:19:07,272 --> 01:19:14,154
They'd post me up front.
Darn near ahead of the lines.

509
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:18,658
And I'd sit... forever.

510
01:19:18,909 --> 01:19:23,084
It's an amazing thing what you
can see while you're sittin'.

511
01:19:23,335 --> 01:19:31,094
I'd look for the officers, the
radio guys or artillery spotter.

512
01:19:32,136 --> 01:19:37,391
Sometime I'd spot
a gun nest by the smoke

513
01:19:37,642 --> 01:19:40,228
and I'd fire into it.

514
01:19:40,478 --> 01:19:45,817
Sometime it was just
a movement in the woods.

515
01:19:50,327 --> 01:19:53,247
We had a scout,

516
01:19:53,497 --> 01:19:55,916
a little fella...

517
01:19:56,166 --> 01:19:58,919
name of Kotz.

518
01:19:59,753 --> 01:20:04,258
He was a Polish boy
from Milwaukee.

519
01:20:05,926 --> 01:20:10,222
He'd always take recon
and he was darn good at it.

520
01:20:10,472 --> 01:20:17,485
We went by his word and he saved
our skin many a time.

521
01:20:18,236 --> 01:20:22,031
He was a little fella...

522
01:20:26,995 --> 01:20:30,999
We'd broken
out of the hedgerows...

523
01:20:31,082 --> 01:20:35,044
We were makin'
a run across the open

524
01:20:35,295 --> 01:20:39,305
and we come upon a woods.

525
01:20:39,847 --> 01:20:43,184
We started drawin' fire.

526
01:20:43,726 --> 01:20:47,271
I took my usual position...

527
01:20:47,480 --> 01:20:52,860
and I saw somethin' movin',
real slow like.

528
01:20:53,319 --> 01:21:00,451
I waited ten minutes,
it moved again and I shot.

529
01:21:00,451 --> 01:21:03,835
The movement stopped.

530
01:21:04,461 --> 01:21:10,675
The next day
we found Kotz... head shot.

531
01:21:10,842 --> 01:21:16,098
He'd been workin'
his way back toward our lines.

532
01:21:16,556 --> 01:21:22,771
Everyone in the unit thought
a German sniper had taken him...

533
01:21:24,147 --> 01:21:27,693
Everyone, all these years.

534
01:21:28,658 --> 01:21:31,828
Everyone but me.

535
01:22:27,562 --> 01:22:29,272
Ha ha!

536
01:22:29,522 --> 01:22:33,109
See, Harald... brainiac...

537
01:22:33,943 --> 01:22:38,281
Got the mower assembly free with
this here little old wrench...

538
01:22:38,531 --> 01:22:40,200
You said it wouldn't work.

539
01:22:40,450 --> 01:22:45,461
I'd say it worked
pretty good. Wouldn't you?

540
01:22:47,713 --> 01:22:53,803
So help me slide her out.
We can get settled up.

541
01:23:19,042 --> 01:23:26,007
Uh... I got parts and labour
that add up to $247.80.

542
01:23:29,386 --> 01:23:33,646
Well, I'd say that's a little
heavy for light work.

543
01:23:33,896 --> 01:23:35,648
Don't you think?

544
01:23:35,898 --> 01:23:38,985
I've got an old man's eyes,
but, ah...

545
01:23:39,235 --> 01:23:41,988
I'm noticin' some new tyre here.

546
01:23:42,238 --> 01:23:45,533
Well, now... ah,
we got those off a resell,

547
01:23:45,783 --> 01:23:47,577
but the treads are good!

548
01:23:47,827 --> 01:23:52,331
Well, friend, are you chargin'
me for good or for new?

549
01:23:52,582 --> 01:23:57,170
Ahhhh... Thorvald?

550
01:23:57,170 --> 01:24:00,262
Ahh... we can make
an adjustment there.

551
01:24:00,512 --> 01:24:07,644
Well, I think the adjustment
should be about thirty dollars.

552
01:24:07,895 --> 01:24:10,105
Is that what
your pencil's sayin'?

553
01:24:10,355 --> 01:24:13,942
And, ah... about the labour...

554
01:24:14,985 --> 01:24:19,656
I appreciate that you boys have
done some real time on this...

555
01:24:19,907 --> 01:24:24,083
of course, a man's gotta ask
when he's workin' with twins -

556
01:24:24,334 --> 01:24:27,170
especially a bickerin' pair -

557
01:24:27,420 --> 01:24:29,547
how much workin' was fightin'?

558
01:24:29,797 --> 01:24:31,591
He got that right.

559
01:24:31,841 --> 01:24:33,301
Shut up, Danny.

560
01:24:33,551 --> 01:24:38,014
If I was to judge by this joyous
affair I saw today,

561
01:24:38,264 --> 01:24:42,268
I would calculate maybe 20
per cent taken off the labour.

562
01:24:42,519 --> 01:24:45,480
Anything else, mister?

563
01:24:46,147 --> 01:24:50,991
Well, I'm not from these parts,
but where I come from,

564
01:24:51,242 --> 01:24:55,788
I would say that that was a
little rich for Iowa oil.

565
01:24:56,038 --> 01:24:58,457
Take the oil, no charge.

566
01:24:58,707 --> 01:25:04,421
Well, that's a splendid offer
and I do appreciate it.

567
01:25:04,672 --> 01:25:05,798
What's the tally?

568
01:25:06,048 --> 01:25:09,927
Ah... ahhh...

569
01:25:15,856 --> 01:25:17,566
Hundred and eighty even?

570
01:25:17,816 --> 01:25:19,943
Done.

571
01:25:20,193 --> 01:25:25,574
Thanks to you boys, I'm gonna
get this rig back on the road.

572
01:25:25,824 --> 01:25:30,912
I've drove it all the way across
Iowa and I'm hopin' it holds on

573
01:25:31,163 --> 01:25:34,749
till I get to Wisconsin.
My brother lives there.

574
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,880
I haven't seen him
in ten years.

575
01:25:38,132 --> 01:25:40,678
There's no one
knows your life better

576
01:25:40,928 --> 01:25:43,472
than a brother
that's near your age.

577
01:25:43,723 --> 01:25:46,225
He knows who and what you are

578
01:25:46,475 --> 01:25:49,478
better than anyone on Earth.

579
01:25:49,729 --> 01:25:53,983
My brother and I said some...
unforgivable things

580
01:25:54,233 --> 01:26:01,157
the last time we met, but, I'm
tryin' to put that behind me.

581
01:26:01,824 --> 01:26:07,085
And this trip is a hard
swallow... of my pride,

582
01:26:07,961 --> 01:26:12,216
I just hope I'm not too late.

583
01:26:19,431 --> 01:26:23,519
A brother's a brother.

584
01:26:33,368 --> 01:26:36,120
Well...

585
01:26:36,371 --> 01:26:38,623
Guess I'll be turnin' in.

586
01:26:38,873 --> 01:26:43,211
I'll, ah... see you in the
morning, then, before you go.

587
01:26:43,461 --> 01:26:47,048
I'm gonna leave awful early.

588
01:27:05,364 --> 01:27:09,451
I wanna thank you for your
kindness to a stranger.

589
01:27:09,702 --> 01:27:13,581
It's been a genuine pleasure
havin' you here, Alvin.

590
01:27:13,831 --> 01:27:15,457
Write to us, sometime.

591
01:27:15,708 --> 01:27:18,465
I will.

592
01:32:05,194 --> 01:32:07,029
I noticed your campfire.

593
01:32:07,280 --> 01:32:11,867
I brought you some dinner...
Mashed potatoes, meat loaf.

594
01:32:12,118 --> 01:32:15,079
Well, thank you kindly.
I've had my dinner,

595
01:32:15,329 --> 01:32:18,253
but would you
join me for a while?

596
01:32:18,504 --> 01:32:21,300
Sure.

597
01:32:27,055 --> 01:32:29,808
Thank you.

598
01:32:36,690 --> 01:32:39,401
I hope you don't
mind me trespassin'.

599
01:32:39,651 --> 01:32:41,737
Oh, no, not at all.

600
01:32:41,987 --> 01:32:43,326
Made a fine choice.

601
01:32:43,577 --> 01:32:46,831
You're camped next to
one of the oldest cemeteries

602
01:32:47,081 --> 01:32:50,835
in the Midwest.
French Catholic trappers.

603
01:32:51,085 --> 01:32:56,341
- The Marquette party.
- Two of his men.

604
01:32:56,924 --> 01:32:59,552
I couldn't help but notice

605
01:32:59,802 --> 01:33:03,848
the rather unusual
mode of transport.

606
01:33:04,307 --> 01:33:09,985
Well, you're not the first
person to notice that, Padre.

607
01:33:10,194 --> 01:33:13,238
My eyes are bad. I can't drive.

608
01:33:13,489 --> 01:33:16,325
I don't like someone else
drivin' the bus,

609
01:33:16,575 --> 01:33:19,328
and I need to get
to my brother's.

610
01:33:19,578 --> 01:33:20,579
Fair enough.

611
01:33:20,829 --> 01:33:22,289
Where is he?

612
01:33:22,539 --> 01:33:26,085
Well, he's so close,
I can practically feel him.

613
01:33:26,335 --> 01:33:27,503
Mount Zion.

614
01:33:27,753 --> 01:33:29,171
What's his name?

615
01:33:29,421 --> 01:33:32,007
Lyle Straight.

616
01:33:32,257 --> 01:33:39,187
Is he that fella that came in
with a stroke some weeks ago?

617
01:33:39,437 --> 01:33:40,814
Do you know him?

618
01:33:41,064 --> 01:33:43,942
I work at the hospital
in Boscobel.

619
01:33:44,192 --> 01:33:46,027
I remember him comin' in.

620
01:33:46,278 --> 01:33:49,281
Caught my attention
because... he lives in my parish.

621
01:33:49,531 --> 01:33:50,824
Well, he's a Baptist.

622
01:33:51,074 --> 01:33:55,161
Oh, I believe he told me that.

623
01:33:55,412 --> 01:33:58,377
Told me a few things,
matter of fact,

624
01:33:58,628 --> 01:34:01,299
but he didn't
mention having a brother.

625
01:34:01,549 --> 01:34:09,765
Well, neither one of us has had
a brother for quite some time.

626
01:34:12,268 --> 01:34:15,479
So, you saw him?
Is he all right?

627
01:34:15,730 --> 01:34:22,654
I only saw him that once and
I haven't heard anything more.

628
01:34:33,837 --> 01:34:39,009
Well, Lyle and I grew up
as close as brothers could be.

629
01:34:39,259 --> 01:34:43,722
We were raised on a farm
in Moorhead, Minnesota.

630
01:34:43,972 --> 01:34:49,192
We worked hard. My mom and dad
darn near killed themselves

631
01:34:49,442 --> 01:34:52,445
tryin' to make that farm work.

632
01:34:52,695 --> 01:34:58,785
And me and Lyle would
make games out of our chores.

633
01:34:58,951 --> 01:35:02,747
We'd dream up somethin'
about racin' and wagerin'

634
01:35:02,997 --> 01:35:06,626
do anything to keep
our mind off the cold.

635
01:35:06,876 --> 01:35:08,252
Lord, it was cold.

636
01:35:08,503 --> 01:35:13,052
He and I used
to sleep out in the yard

637
01:35:13,303 --> 01:35:16,266
every summer night,
if it wasn't pourin'.

638
01:35:16,517 --> 01:35:20,688
Nine months of winter,
we couldn't get enough summer.

639
01:35:20,938 --> 01:35:24,024
We'd bunk down
when the sun went down.

640
01:35:24,274 --> 01:35:28,779
We'd talk to each other
until we went to sleep.

641
01:35:29,029 --> 01:35:34,576
We'd talk about the stars
and whether there might be

642
01:35:34,827 --> 01:35:38,502
somebody else like us
out in space,

643
01:35:38,753 --> 01:35:41,589
places we wanted to go and...

644
01:35:41,840 --> 01:35:46,302
it made
our trials seem smaller.

645
01:35:46,845 --> 01:35:52,517
Yeah, we pretty much talked
each other through growin' up.

646
01:35:55,812 --> 01:36:02,235
Oh, whatever happened
between you two?

647
01:36:02,485 --> 01:36:07,955
Story as old as the Bible.
Cain and Abel.

648
01:36:09,957 --> 01:36:12,710
Anger, vanity.

649
01:36:14,420 --> 01:36:17,840
You mix that together
with liquor, and...

650
01:36:18,090 --> 01:36:24,847
you've got two brothers who
haven't spoken in ten years.

651
01:36:25,264 --> 01:36:31,360
Well, whatever it was
that made me and Lyle so mad...

652
01:36:31,610 --> 01:36:34,863
don't matter any more.

653
01:36:35,113 --> 01:36:37,741
I wanna make peace.

654
01:36:37,991 --> 01:36:40,911
I wanna sit with him,

655
01:36:41,161 --> 01:36:44,039
look up at the stars...

656
01:36:44,289 --> 01:36:47,167
like we used to do...

657
01:36:47,417 --> 01:36:50,212
so long ago.

658
01:36:55,348 --> 01:36:56,891
Well, sir...

659
01:36:57,141 --> 01:37:01,688
I say "Amen" to that.

660
01:37:57,922 --> 01:38:00,717
Howdy.

661
01:38:16,322 --> 01:38:19,950
I haven't had a drink
in a lot of years.

662
01:38:20,201 --> 01:38:22,661
Now I'm gonna have me a beer.

663
01:38:22,912 --> 01:38:24,163
What flavour?

664
01:38:24,413 --> 01:38:29,001
What does
a Miller's Lite taste like?

665
01:38:38,558 --> 01:38:41,353
There you go.

666
01:38:45,399 --> 01:38:48,068
- How's it taste?
- It's good.

667
01:38:48,318 --> 01:38:50,904
- Keep the change.
- Thank you.

668
01:38:51,154 --> 01:38:55,826
It's an interesting rig you got
outside. Get up the hill OK?

669
01:38:56,076 --> 01:39:00,128
That hill and 200 more
just like it.

670
01:39:00,378 --> 01:39:02,213
How far did ya come?

671
01:39:02,463 --> 01:39:04,465
From Iowa.

672
01:39:04,716 --> 01:39:06,843
I'm headed
for Lyle Straight's place.

673
01:39:07,093 --> 01:39:10,722
Iowa! My God,
you must be thirsty.

674
01:39:56,654 --> 01:39:57,655
Another beer?

675
01:39:57,906 --> 01:39:59,616
This will do me fine.

676
01:39:59,866 --> 01:40:03,078
I wonder could you point me
to Lyle's place?

677
01:40:03,328 --> 01:40:06,623
I haven't seen him
in an awful long time.

678
01:40:06,873 --> 01:40:11,086
Well, you just... ah,
cross 61 here, on "W",

679
01:40:11,336 --> 01:40:16,180
Take "W" on down to Weed Road
and then on to Remington Road.

680
01:40:16,430 --> 01:40:19,850
On your right
will be Lyle's place.

681
01:40:20,101 --> 01:40:24,397
If he's there that is.

682
01:42:44,323 --> 01:42:45,658
How you doin'...?

683
01:42:45,908 --> 01:42:48,702
Not too good.

684
01:42:51,455 --> 01:42:54,667
This thing's just tired.

685
01:42:58,879 --> 01:43:02,424
Is there anything
I can do to help you?

686
01:43:02,675 --> 01:43:06,178
Well, I don't know.
It just quit on me.

687
01:43:06,428 --> 01:43:08,770
Why don't you try her again?

688
01:43:11,731 --> 01:43:14,818
I'm headin'
to Lyle Straight's place.

689
01:45:21,266 --> 01:45:24,644
Lyle!

690
01:45:27,355 --> 01:45:30,275
Lyle?

691
01:45:38,581 --> 01:45:41,542
Alvin?

692
01:46:20,754 --> 01:46:24,341
Sit down, Alvin.

693
01:47:13,819 --> 01:47:20,290
Did you ride that thing all
the way out here to see me?

694
01:47:20,540 --> 01:47:23,501
I did, Lyle.
