1
00:00:06,219 --> 00:00:09,188
-Hotel Splendid, sir?
-That's right.

2
00:00:11,457 --> 00:00:13,687
-Thank you, sir.
-Thank you.

3
00:00:27,206 --> 00:00:30,004
It's just last-minute details.

4
00:00:31,711 --> 00:00:33,440
Apparently we're very much in love.

5
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:37,149
Do you usually leave it to porters
to tell you this sort of thing?

6
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:40,046
Only when the romance
has been necessarily brief.

7
00:00:40,453 --> 00:00:43,422
I'm Mr. Arlington Beech,
professional gambler...

8
00:00:43,623 --> 00:00:45,181
...and you're
Miss Stephanie Broadchest--

9
00:00:45,391 --> 00:00:47,586
-I am not.
-You're gonna have to trust me on this.

10
00:00:47,794 --> 00:00:49,762
Oh, no, I don't.

11
00:00:49,962 --> 00:00:51,862
We've been involved
for quite a while...

12
00:00:52,598 --> 00:00:54,361
...hence the shared suite.

13
00:00:54,567 --> 00:00:56,933
But my family
is strict Roman Catholic...

14
00:00:57,136 --> 00:00:59,866
...so for appearances' sake,
it'll be a two-bedroom suite.

15
00:01:00,073 --> 00:01:03,338
I do hate it when religion
comes between us.

16
00:01:03,643 --> 00:01:06,043
Religion and a securely locked door.

17
00:01:06,245 --> 00:01:08,213
Am I going to have a problem
with you, Bond?

18
00:01:08,414 --> 00:01:11,178
No, don't worry. You're not my type.

19
00:01:11,417 --> 00:01:12,509
Smart?

20
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:14,814
Single.

21
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,031
Welcome to the Hotel Splendid.
Your name, sir?

22
00:01:36,242 --> 00:01:39,109
James Bond. You'll find
the reservation under Beech.

23
00:01:39,312 --> 00:01:42,042
-Welcome, Mr. Bond.
-You sign that, dear.

24
00:01:42,682 --> 00:01:45,014
You represent the Treasury.

25
00:01:49,355 --> 00:01:52,017
Thank you. Enjoy your stay.

26
00:01:52,225 --> 00:01:53,817
I will. Thank you.

27
00:01:56,829 --> 00:01:57,989
Very funny.

28
00:01:58,197 --> 00:02:00,165
Look, if Le Chiffre
is that well-connected...

29
00:02:00,366 --> 00:02:02,493
...he knows who I am
and where the money's from.

30
00:02:02,702 --> 00:02:04,863
Which means he's decided
to play me anyway.

31
00:02:05,071 --> 00:02:07,437
So he's either desperate
or he's overly confident...

32
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,938
...but either way, that tells me
something about him.

33
00:02:10,143 --> 00:02:12,668
And all he gets in return
is a name he already has.

34
00:02:12,979 --> 00:02:14,606
And now he knows
something about you.

35
00:02:14,814 --> 00:02:17,009
He knows you're reckless.

36
00:02:17,617 --> 00:02:19,448
Take the next one.

37
00:02:19,652 --> 00:02:22,519
There isn't enough room for me
and your ego.

38
00:02:22,922 --> 00:02:24,480
Mr. Bond?

39
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:27,022
-It was left for you.
-Thank you.

40
00:02:58,157 --> 00:02:59,681
I love you too, M.

41
00:03:38,864 --> 00:03:44,063
My name is Mathis. Rene Mathis.
I'm your contact here.

42
00:03:47,573 --> 00:03:49,131
Does he know
we've been watching him?

43
00:03:49,342 --> 00:03:52,004
Le Chiffre? I don't think so.

44
00:03:52,211 --> 00:03:56,545
Probably because there's no ''we.''
Just me.

45
00:03:57,183 --> 00:03:59,151
I'm afraid if you get
into trouble here...

46
00:03:59,352 --> 00:04:03,083
...the cavalry won't be
coming over the nearest hill.

47
00:04:04,624 --> 00:04:06,421
Le Chiffre arrived yesterday...

48
00:04:06,859 --> 00:04:10,386
...and spent the time reestablishing
old relationships.

49
00:04:10,997 --> 00:04:13,932
The chief of police and he
are now quite close.

50
00:04:14,133 --> 00:04:16,033
That's him, with the mustache.

51
00:04:16,235 --> 00:04:17,793
Over my left shoulder.

52
00:04:18,871 --> 00:04:21,066
Well, that could make life
quite difficult.

53
00:04:21,274 --> 00:04:23,242
Yeah, and quite possibly shorter.

54
00:04:23,442 --> 00:04:26,070
He's not a very subtle man.

55
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:29,442
I thought about trying to buy
his services, but we frankly...

56
00:04:29,649 --> 00:04:32,846
...couldn't afford to outbid Le Chiffre.

57
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,120
I hate to say it...

58
00:04:42,328 --> 00:04:46,287
...but the accountants seem
to be running Ml6 these days.

59
00:04:47,366 --> 00:04:50,563
Oh, not that I have anything
against accountants.

60
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:53,034
Many of them are lovely people.

61
00:04:54,573 --> 00:04:57,667
So I decided that it was cheaper
to supply his deputy...

62
00:04:57,877 --> 00:05:01,472
...with evidence
that we were bribing the chief.

63
00:05:01,681 --> 00:05:06,015
It's amazing what you can do with
Photoshop these days, isn't it?

64
00:05:08,954 --> 00:05:11,582
I think your odds are improving,
Mr. Bond.

65
00:05:17,063 --> 00:05:18,428
Yes?

66
00:05:19,098 --> 00:05:20,759
For you.

67
00:05:21,934 --> 00:05:24,425
Something you expect me to wear?

68
00:05:26,906 --> 00:05:28,237
I need you looking fabulous.

69
00:05:28,441 --> 00:05:30,739
So when you walk up behind me
and kiss me on the neck...

70
00:05:30,943 --> 00:05:33,309
...the players will be thinking
about your neckline...

71
00:05:33,512 --> 00:05:35,241
...and not about their cards.

72
00:05:35,448 --> 00:05:37,848
Do you think you can
do that for me?

73
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:39,984
I'll do my best.

74
00:05:41,053 --> 00:05:42,987
Thank you.

75
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,228
I have a dinner jacket.

76
00:05:57,436 --> 00:05:59,768
There are dinner jackets
and dinner jackets.

77
00:05:59,972 --> 00:06:01,132
This is the latter.

78
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:04,537
And I need you looking like a man
who belongs at that table.

79
00:06:04,977 --> 00:06:06,604
How--?

80
00:06:07,413 --> 00:06:08,880
It's tailored.

81
00:06:09,081 --> 00:06:11,641
I sized you up the moment we met.

82
00:07:05,337 --> 00:07:07,965
-Good evening, sir.
-Good evening.

83
00:07:09,909 --> 00:07:11,570
Thank you.

84
00:07:22,354 --> 00:07:24,481
And you must be
Mr. Bliss' replacement.

85
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:26,783
Welcome, Mr. Beech.

86
00:07:27,993 --> 00:07:30,791
Or is that Bond?
I'm a little confused.

87
00:07:30,996 --> 00:07:33,430
Well, we wouldn't want that,
would we?

88
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:44,866
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome.

89
00:07:45,077 --> 00:07:47,671
As you know, the game is no-limit
hold 'em poker.

90
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,814
Five communal cards,
two in the hole.

91
00:07:50,282 --> 00:07:53,046
Monsieur Mendel here represents
the Basel Bank, Switzerland...

92
00:07:53,252 --> 00:07:54,480
...holding the stakes.

93
00:07:56,789 --> 00:07:59,314
You have each deposited
$ 10 million buy-in.

94
00:07:59,525 --> 00:08:02,426
A further buy-in of 5 million
can be made by electronic transfer.

95
00:08:02,628 --> 00:08:04,721
The money will remain in escrow
until I return...

96
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:07,660
...and the winner of the contest
enters his or her password...

97
00:08:07,867 --> 00:08:09,027
...into the encryptor...

98
00:08:09,235 --> 00:08:10,964
...whereupon the entire sum
will be wired...

99
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:13,297
...to any bank account
in the world you nominate.

100
00:08:13,873 --> 00:08:15,602
Mr. Bond?

101
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:17,201
We proceed alphabetically.

102
00:08:17,409 --> 00:08:19,843
Please be so kind as to enter
a password of your choice.

103
00:08:28,254 --> 00:08:29,414
Six letters or more.

104
00:08:42,501 --> 00:08:45,163
High card for dealer position.

105
00:08:52,211 --> 00:08:53,508
It's Signor Gallardo.

106
00:08:53,712 --> 00:08:56,738
Mr. Kaminofsky is
the small blind, $5000...

107
00:08:56,949 --> 00:09:00,407
...and Mr. Fukutu, the big blind,
$ 10,000.

108
00:09:02,521 --> 00:09:04,546
Well, enjoy the game.

109
00:09:28,414 --> 00:09:29,506
Four players.

110
00:09:32,117 --> 00:09:33,448
It's your bet.

111
00:09:34,987 --> 00:09:36,454
Check.

112
00:09:36,655 --> 00:09:38,452
Check.

113
00:09:42,761 --> 00:09:44,820
Bet. Fifty thousand.

114
00:09:58,043 --> 00:09:59,305
Call.

115
00:10:02,581 --> 00:10:03,843
Fold.

116
00:10:06,051 --> 00:10:08,451
Fold. Heads up.

117
00:10:12,758 --> 00:10:14,191
Monsieur Le Chiffre.

118
00:10:25,704 --> 00:10:28,264
Bet. One hundred thousand.

119
00:10:31,377 --> 00:10:34,369
Weren't you supposed to enter
so the others could see you?

120
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:37,606
Was I? Forgive me.

121
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:40,345
Good luck, darling.

122
00:10:44,156 --> 00:10:46,556
It's up to you, Monsieur Bond.

123
00:10:48,527 --> 00:10:49,721
Monsieur Bond?

124
00:10:49,928 --> 00:10:52,590
Oh, I'm sorry. What was the bet?
A hundred thousand?

125
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:55,128
Call.

126
00:11:00,272 --> 00:11:01,432
Hello.

127
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:05,235
I suppose I don't have to tell you
how beautiful you look.

128
00:11:05,444 --> 00:11:08,572
Half the people at that table
are still watching you.

129
00:11:08,781 --> 00:11:09,748
Champagne.

130
00:11:13,452 --> 00:11:15,317
Monsieur Le Chiffre.

131
00:11:26,398 --> 00:11:27,695
Bet. Two hundred thousand.

132
00:11:34,106 --> 00:11:37,872
Monsieur, you have been called.
Showdown, please.

133
00:11:39,545 --> 00:11:42,708
A full house to Monsieur Le Chiffre.
Deuces full of nines.

134
00:11:42,915 --> 00:11:44,712
Mr. Bond?

135
00:11:47,619 --> 00:11:48,950
Fold.

136
00:11:56,328 --> 00:11:58,660
Send the barman over, please.

137
00:12:06,805 --> 00:12:09,603
A dry martini. Wait.

138
00:12:09,808 --> 00:12:11,503
Three measures Gordon's,
one of vodka...

139
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:13,541
...half of Kina Lillet,
shake it over ice...

140
00:12:13,746 --> 00:12:16,579
-...then add a thin slice of lemon peel.
-Yes, sir.

141
00:12:16,782 --> 00:12:19,649
-You know, I'll have one of those.
-So will I.

142
00:12:20,619 --> 00:12:21,847
Certainly.

143
00:12:22,788 --> 00:12:26,690
My friend, bring me one as well.
Keep the fruit.

144
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:28,890
That's it?

145
00:12:30,195 --> 00:12:31,787
Anyone want to play poker now?

146
00:12:31,997 --> 00:12:33,157
Someone's in a hurry.

147
00:12:42,174 --> 00:12:44,108
Would you excuse me?

148
00:12:57,623 --> 00:12:58,954
You taste nice.

149
00:12:59,158 --> 00:13:02,093
-I thought we dispensed with covers.
-No.

150
00:13:02,294 --> 00:13:05,991
We dispensed with one that was
of no use and created another that is.

151
00:13:06,198 --> 00:13:07,722
-Is he watching?
-Yes.

152
00:13:07,933 --> 00:13:08,991
Good.

153
00:13:09,201 --> 00:13:11,965
This is me in character pissed off
because you're losing so fast...

154
00:13:12,171 --> 00:13:13,934
...we won't be here past midnight.

155
00:13:14,139 --> 00:13:17,108
Oddly, my character's feelings
mirror my own.

156
00:13:17,743 --> 00:13:19,301
Check.

157
00:13:19,945 --> 00:13:21,776
-You know, that's not half bad.
-Up to you.

158
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,880
I'm gonna have to think up
a name for that.

159
00:13:25,417 --> 00:13:27,977
It was worth it to discover his tell.

160
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,582
What do you mean?

161
00:13:29,955 --> 00:13:31,980
The twitch he has to hide
when he bluffs.

162
00:13:32,191 --> 00:13:36,321
-Bluffs? He had the best hand.
-Which he got on the last card.

163
00:13:36,528 --> 00:13:38,723
The odds against were 23-to-1,
and he'd know that.

164
00:13:38,931 --> 00:13:40,899
When he did his first raise
he had nothing.

165
00:13:41,099 --> 00:13:42,623
Winning was blind luck.

166
00:13:42,835 --> 00:13:44,666
-Did you get the bug?
-Yes.

167
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:46,735
Bet. One hundred thousand.

168
00:13:46,939 --> 00:13:48,463
Thank you.

169
00:13:50,275 --> 00:13:51,708
It's your play, Monsieur Fukutu.

170
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:54,936
Maybe he can actually pull this off.

171
00:13:55,781 --> 00:13:57,214
Call.

172
00:13:58,817 --> 00:14:00,785
Monsieur Le Chiffre.

173
00:14:03,322 --> 00:14:05,847
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mesdames, Messieurs...

174
00:14:06,058 --> 00:14:07,821
...we've now been
playing for four hours.

175
00:14:08,026 --> 00:14:12,486
It's time for a short break.
We will resume play in one hour.

176
00:14:41,326 --> 00:14:47,094
Well, I think I'll report
on the evening's frivolities.

177
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,565
So?

178
00:14:50,769 --> 00:14:52,896
You want to do what to me?

179
00:14:53,105 --> 00:14:54,436
You've lost me completely.

180
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:57,575
You just said you can't wait
to get me back to the room. Come on.

181
00:15:21,533 --> 00:15:25,162
So, what's so damn important?

182
00:15:27,606 --> 00:15:29,198
I'm sorry.

183
00:15:32,077 --> 00:15:33,635
Where is my money?

184
00:15:38,183 --> 00:15:39,377
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

185
00:15:39,584 --> 00:15:41,814
You're holding a parcel for me.

186
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:48,119
Thank you.

187
00:15:49,394 --> 00:15:53,558
Do you think you can lose that kind
of money and no one would notice?

188
00:15:54,099 --> 00:15:55,896
Your money is safe.

189
00:15:57,703 --> 00:15:59,432
Open that.

190
00:16:15,454 --> 00:16:17,513
You'll have it tomorrow.

191
00:16:18,457 --> 00:16:19,754
All of it.

192
00:16:33,238 --> 00:16:37,197
I would take a hand for this betrayal,
but you need it to play cards.

193
00:16:41,747 --> 00:16:43,476
Hold out your arm.

194
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,547
Hold out your arm, my beauty...

195
00:16:47,185 --> 00:16:48,777
...or I will take your head.

196
00:16:58,697 --> 00:17:01,632
Go to the room. Wait for me there.

197
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:15,947
Stairs.

198
00:17:20,452 --> 00:17:23,080
Not a word of protest.

199
00:17:23,688 --> 00:17:26,248
You should find a new boyfriend.

200
00:19:11,396 --> 00:19:13,091
Go find Mathis.

201
00:19:13,298 --> 00:19:16,529
Tell him I've hidden the bodies here
and I want him to get rid of them.

202
00:19:16,735 --> 00:19:19,761
Do that now. Go. Go, go!

203
00:20:22,601 --> 00:20:25,195
You changed your shirt, Mr. Bond.

204
00:20:25,537 --> 00:20:29,234
I hope our little game
isn't causing you to perspire.

205
00:20:29,441 --> 00:20:30,669
A little.

206
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:34,436
But I won't consider myself to be
in trouble until I start weeping blood.

207
00:20:34,646 --> 00:20:38,673
Ladies and gentlemen, if everybody's
ready, let's continue the game.

208
00:21:39,911 --> 00:21:44,280
It's like there's blood on my hands.
It's not coming off.

209
00:21:45,317 --> 00:21:47,182
Here, let's see.

210
00:22:02,767 --> 00:22:04,598
That's better.

211
00:22:08,673 --> 00:22:10,004
You cold?

212
00:22:10,208 --> 00:22:11,607
Yeah.

213
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:13,710
Here.

214
00:23:10,435 --> 00:23:12,699
You have any trouble
with the bodies?

215
00:23:13,071 --> 00:23:15,198
Less than some.

216
00:23:28,987 --> 00:23:32,718
Being dead doesn't mean
one can't still be helpful.

217
00:23:33,658 --> 00:23:36,354
That'll keep Le Chiffre
looking over his shoulder.

218
00:23:36,561 --> 00:23:38,791
He'll be wondering who's gonna
come for him next.

219
00:23:40,432 --> 00:23:42,662
How's our girl?

220
00:23:43,201 --> 00:23:46,398
Melted your cold heart yet?

221
00:24:04,322 --> 00:24:05,516
Call.

222
00:24:05,723 --> 00:24:07,122
Fold.

223
00:24:07,325 --> 00:24:09,293
And call.

224
00:24:10,595 --> 00:24:12,654
Three players.

225
00:24:16,267 --> 00:24:18,030
Three hundred grand.

226
00:24:18,236 --> 00:24:19,897
Bet. Three hundred thousand.

227
00:24:21,773 --> 00:24:23,434
Call.

228
00:24:25,176 --> 00:24:26,143
And call.

229
00:24:31,316 --> 00:24:32,613
Three players.

230
00:24:36,955 --> 00:24:37,944
Check.

231
00:24:43,461 --> 00:24:44,621
Monsieur Bond?

232
00:24:54,506 --> 00:24:56,940
Bet. Five hundred thousand.

233
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:12,920
Look. It's the tell. He is bluffing.

234
00:25:13,124 --> 00:25:15,149
My God, James was right.

235
00:25:16,261 --> 00:25:18,195
It's up to you.

236
00:25:24,335 --> 00:25:26,735
Raise. One million.

237
00:25:33,811 --> 00:25:36,177
Seems someone knows
something I don't.

238
00:25:37,215 --> 00:25:38,409
Fold.

239
00:25:38,616 --> 00:25:40,379
Heads up, gentlemen.

240
00:25:40,585 --> 00:25:42,143
It's up to you.

241
00:25:56,334 --> 00:25:57,801
Two.

242
00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:00,663
Re-raise. Two million.

243
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,699
And it's up to you.

244
00:26:15,787 --> 00:26:17,652
I'm all in.

245
00:26:25,063 --> 00:26:27,429
Well, it's 14 million
and 500,000.

246
00:26:27,632 --> 00:26:29,964
It's up to you, Monsieur Bond.

247
00:26:32,604 --> 00:26:36,973
Bond will have to go all in
to call his bluff.

248
00:26:37,909 --> 00:26:40,639
-Call.
-Call.

249
00:26:41,079 --> 00:26:43,445
Gentlemen, showdown, please.

250
00:26:45,183 --> 00:26:47,583
Full house. Kings and aces.

251
00:26:47,785 --> 00:26:49,810
Monsieur Le Chiffre.

252
00:27:02,767 --> 00:27:06,464
It's four jacks.
Monsieur Le Chiffre wins.

253
00:27:10,475 --> 00:27:13,638
You must have thought
I was bluffing, Mr. Bond.

254
00:27:14,312 --> 00:27:15,472
Please.

255
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,978
We will now break for one hour.

256
00:27:18,182 --> 00:27:21,515
When we return,
the big blind will be 200,000.

257
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,621
Good game.

258
00:27:58,756 --> 00:28:02,089
Well, I'm gonna need the other
5 million to buy back in.

259
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:04,992
I can't do that, James.

260
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:07,930
Look, I made a mistake.

261
00:28:08,733 --> 00:28:11,725
I was impatient, maybe I was arrogant,
but I can beat him.

262
00:28:11,936 --> 00:28:13,369
-I'm sorry.
-Sorry?

263
00:28:14,439 --> 00:28:15,872
Sorry?

264
00:28:16,074 --> 00:28:17,837
Try putting that in a sentence.

265
00:28:18,042 --> 00:28:19,441
''Sorry Le Chiffre's gonna win...

266
00:28:19,644 --> 00:28:21,976
...continue funding terror and killing.''
That kind of sorry?

267
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:25,240
You lost because of your ego,
and that same ego can't take it.

268
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:26,849
That's what this is about.

269
00:28:27,051 --> 00:28:29,019
All you're going to do now
is lose more.

270
00:28:29,654 --> 00:28:30,814
Then you're an idiot.

271
00:28:31,022 --> 00:28:33,889
-I'm sorry?
-I said, you're a bloody idiot.

272
00:28:35,793 --> 00:28:38,057
Look in my eyes.

273
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:40,593
I can beat this man, you know that.

274
00:28:43,234 --> 00:28:45,828
Get your hand off my arm.

275
00:29:08,726 --> 00:29:09,886
Vodka martini.

276
00:29:10,094 --> 00:29:12,892
-Shaken or stirred?
-Do I look like I give a damn?

277
00:29:31,082 --> 00:29:33,346
-James.
-Get the girl out.

278
00:29:40,625 --> 00:29:41,592
Funny game, right?

279
00:29:41,793 --> 00:29:44,887
Sorry, I should've introduced myself,
seeing as we're related.

280
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:48,724
Felix Leiter, a brother from Langley.

281
00:29:50,735 --> 00:29:52,134
You should have a little faith.

282
00:29:52,336 --> 00:29:54,827
If you keep your head about you,
I think you have him.

283
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:57,303
Had. Excuse me.

284
00:29:57,742 --> 00:29:59,676
You're not buying in?

285
00:30:01,379 --> 00:30:02,744
No.

286
00:30:06,083 --> 00:30:10,019
Listen, I'm bleeding chips.
I'm not gonna last much longer.

287
00:30:10,221 --> 00:30:12,883
You have a better chance.
I'll stake you.

288
00:30:13,958 --> 00:30:16,051
I'm saying I'll give you the money
to keep going.

289
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:21,129
Just one thing. If you pull it off,
the CIA bring him in.

290
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,832
And what about the winnings?

291
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:28,096
Does it look like
we need the money?

292
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:41,743
Shall we up the blinds?

293
00:30:43,955 --> 00:30:45,650
Why not?

294
00:30:49,126 --> 00:30:50,616
Bet.

295
00:30:52,697 --> 00:30:54,358
Raise.

296
00:31:09,881 --> 00:31:11,815
And fold.

297
00:31:14,051 --> 00:31:16,019
Excuse me, please.

298
00:31:17,722 --> 00:31:19,349
Call.

299
00:31:20,892 --> 00:31:22,052
Raise.

300
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:25,718
Raise. Five hundred thousand.

301
00:31:28,232 --> 00:31:30,166
-Fold.
-Thank you.

302
00:31:32,536 --> 00:31:33,696
Fold.

303
00:31:37,975 --> 00:31:39,499
Fold.

304
00:31:44,415 --> 00:31:45,848
Thank you.

305
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:47,017
Wins.

306
00:32:08,139 --> 00:32:09,299
Deal me out.

307
00:32:10,308 --> 00:32:13,436
Sorry, sir. You are the big blind.

308
00:32:15,413 --> 00:32:16,971
Small blind, please.

309
00:33:21,078 --> 00:33:23,478
-Who is it?
-It's 007.

310
00:33:25,149 --> 00:33:27,709
Bond's been poisoned.
He's going into cardiac arrest.

311
00:33:29,887 --> 00:33:32,321
Stay calm and don't interrupt.
Because you'll be dead...

312
00:33:32,523 --> 00:33:35,151
...within two minutes
unless you do exactly what I tell you.

313
00:33:35,459 --> 00:33:36,619
I'm all ears.

314
00:33:36,827 --> 00:33:38,351
Remove the defibrillator
from the pouch.

315
00:33:38,562 --> 00:33:40,894
-Do we know what it is yet?
-We're still scanning.

316
00:33:46,537 --> 00:33:49,267
Attach the leads to your chest.

317
00:33:57,915 --> 00:33:59,883
Ventricular tachycardia. Digitalis.

318
00:34:00,184 --> 00:34:02,982
What do we give him? The kit
has amphetamines, antihistamines...

319
00:34:03,187 --> 00:34:04,814
...hydrocortisone. Adrenalin?

320
00:34:05,022 --> 00:34:07,752
-As soon as it reads charged--
-Lidocaine. That'll work.

321
00:34:07,958 --> 00:34:10,426
Bond, don't push the red button yet.
Do you hear me? Don't push it.

322
00:34:10,628 --> 00:34:12,061
His heart's gonna stop.

323
00:34:12,263 --> 00:34:14,629
There's only time for one charge
before he passes out.

324
00:34:15,633 --> 00:34:19,501
Take the blue combipen, Bond.
Mid-neck into the vein.

325
00:34:19,703 --> 00:34:22,001
That'll counteract the digitalis.

326
00:34:25,309 --> 00:34:27,106
You're going to pass out
in a few seconds.

327
00:34:27,311 --> 00:34:28,744
You need to keep
your heart going.

328
00:34:28,946 --> 00:34:30,174
Push the red button now, Bond.

329
00:34:36,287 --> 00:34:38,721
-Bond, push the damn button!
-Do it now!

330
00:35:26,604 --> 00:35:28,572
-You okay?
-Me?

331
00:35:31,909 --> 00:35:34,503
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

332
00:35:34,712 --> 00:35:38,375
-Now get yourself off to a hospital.
-I will do.

333
00:35:39,383 --> 00:35:40,782
As soon as I've won this game.

334
00:35:40,985 --> 00:35:43,715
You're not seriously
going back there?

335
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:48,190
I wouldn't dream of it.

336
00:35:49,827 --> 00:35:51,419
Bet. One million.

337
00:35:55,166 --> 00:35:56,724
-All in.
-Call. All in.

338
00:35:56,934 --> 00:35:59,528
Gentlemen, showdown, please.

339
00:36:01,539 --> 00:36:03,439
Two pair. Aces and sevens.

340
00:36:07,378 --> 00:36:09,812
Queen plays. Wins.

341
00:36:18,389 --> 00:36:19,583
Oh, I'm sorry.

342
00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:22,350
That last hand, it nearly killed me.

343
00:36:23,794 --> 00:36:27,389
Gentlemen, with this chip exchange,
we enter the final phase of the game...

344
00:36:27,598 --> 00:36:29,361
...which means no more buy-ins.

345
00:36:29,567 --> 00:36:32,764
The big blind is now
1 million dollars.

346
00:36:39,843 --> 00:36:40,969
Four players.

347
00:36:43,781 --> 00:36:45,146
It's your bet.

348
00:36:49,186 --> 00:36:50,346
-Monsieur Bond?
-Check.

349
00:36:50,554 --> 00:36:54,388
-Check.
-Twenty-four million in the pot already.

350
00:36:57,261 --> 00:36:59,388
Check. And check.

351
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:01,422
All check.

352
00:37:01,765 --> 00:37:02,959
Four players.

353
00:37:07,972 --> 00:37:09,371
-Check.
-Check.

354
00:37:15,279 --> 00:37:17,440
All in. Six million.

355
00:37:18,349 --> 00:37:20,874
Bet. Six million. All in.

356
00:37:26,323 --> 00:37:28,655
Five million. All in.

357
00:37:28,859 --> 00:37:31,419
Bet is 6 million.

358
00:37:38,936 --> 00:37:40,267
Raise.

359
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:43,033
Raise.

360
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:46,505
Twelve million. Heads up.

361
00:38:17,107 --> 00:38:20,235
Forty million, 500,000. All in.

362
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,511
Raise. All in.

363
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:46,995
Well, I think I will call you
on that one.

364
00:38:53,844 --> 00:38:55,038
Call.

365
00:39:06,924 --> 00:39:11,122
One hundred and fifteen million
in the pot.

366
00:39:11,328 --> 00:39:14,058
Gentlemen, showdown, please.

367
00:39:17,701 --> 00:39:19,635
Flush. Ace, king, queen.

368
00:39:28,212 --> 00:39:31,204
Full house. Eights full of aces.

369
00:39:49,366 --> 00:39:51,493
A higher full house.

370
00:39:51,702 --> 00:39:53,169
Aces full of sixes.

371
00:39:59,176 --> 00:40:00,370
Monsieur Bond.

372
00:40:17,428 --> 00:40:19,919
Five and seven of spades.

373
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:21,597
A straight flush.

374
00:40:21,799 --> 00:40:23,096
Four to the eight.

375
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:25,393
The high hand.

376
00:40:30,107 --> 00:40:31,631
Monsieur Bond wins.

377
00:40:32,643 --> 00:40:34,941
-For you.
-Thank you very much.

378
00:40:37,381 --> 00:40:38,575
Congratulations.

379
00:40:38,782 --> 00:40:42,309
-He's all yours.
-Much appreciated, brother.

380
00:40:49,293 --> 00:40:50,453
Congratulations.

381
00:40:50,661 --> 00:40:52,526
You know,
I think a celebration's in order.

382
00:40:52,729 --> 00:40:55,254
You were almost dead an hour ago.

383
00:40:56,133 --> 00:40:59,125
Come on, I'm famished.

384
00:41:09,546 --> 00:41:11,411
Thank you.

385
00:41:19,022 --> 00:41:22,924
Mathis says the Americans
have made contact with Le Chiffre.

386
00:41:23,126 --> 00:41:25,754
They're going to extract him
before dawn.

387
00:41:26,463 --> 00:41:28,431
You know, I think
I'll call that a Vesper.

388
00:41:29,833 --> 00:41:31,630
Because of the bitter aftertaste?

389
00:41:31,835 --> 00:41:35,999
No. Because once you've tasted it,
that's all you want to drink.

390
00:41:38,609 --> 00:41:41,703
-I thought that was quite a good line.
-It was a very good line.

391
00:41:42,946 --> 00:41:44,436
But you're laughing at it.

392
00:41:44,781 --> 00:41:49,047
-Not so much it as you.
-Well, that's fine then.

393
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:56,917
I figured out what that is.

394
00:41:59,363 --> 00:42:01,627
It's an Algerian love knot.

395
00:42:01,832 --> 00:42:05,029
Really? I thought it was
just something pretty.

396
00:42:05,235 --> 00:42:06,862
No, you didn't.

397
00:42:07,771 --> 00:42:09,238
Someone gave that to you.

398
00:42:12,943 --> 00:42:14,672
He's a very lucky man.

399
00:42:21,184 --> 00:42:24,017
You can switch off so easily,
can't you?

400
00:42:24,388 --> 00:42:26,583
It doesn't bother you,
killing those people?

401
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:30,216
Well, I wouldn't be very good
at my job if it did.

402
00:42:31,161 --> 00:42:33,391
I don't believe you.

403
00:42:34,031 --> 00:42:36,192
You've got a choice, you know?

404
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,992
Just because
you've done something...

405
00:42:38,201 --> 00:42:40,328
...doesn't mean
you have to keep doing it.

406
00:42:40,537 --> 00:42:43,438
Why is it people who can't take advice
always insist on giving it?

407
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:45,608
You think I can't take
my own advice?

408
00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:49,172
I think something is driving you.

409
00:42:49,713 --> 00:42:51,738
And I think I'll never find out
what that is.

410
00:42:57,688 --> 00:42:59,815
Mathis needs me.

411
00:43:00,490 --> 00:43:01,752
Good night.

412
00:43:01,959 --> 00:43:03,290
Congratulations again.

413
00:43:22,579 --> 00:43:24,410
Mathis.

414
00:45:16,359 --> 00:45:20,295
I'm afraid your friend Mathis
is really...

415
00:45:21,565 --> 00:45:23,362
...my friend Mathis.

416
00:47:06,136 --> 00:47:08,866
You've taken good care
of your body.

417
00:47:15,412 --> 00:47:17,903
Such a waste.

418
00:47:35,165 --> 00:47:36,996
You know...

419
00:47:37,367 --> 00:47:40,495
...I never understood
all these elaborate tortures.

420
00:47:40,704 --> 00:47:42,899
It's the simplest thing...

421
00:47:43,106 --> 00:47:46,633
...to cause more pain
than a man can possibly endure.

422
00:47:48,144 --> 00:47:49,304
And of course...

423
00:47:49,512 --> 00:47:52,481
...it's not only the immediate agony,
but the knowledge...

424
00:47:52,682 --> 00:47:55,344
...that if you do not yield
soon enough...

425
00:47:56,052 --> 00:47:59,681
...there will be little left
to identify you as a man.

426
00:48:05,762 --> 00:48:07,662
The only question remains...

427
00:48:09,165 --> 00:48:11,326
...will you yield in time?

428
00:48:13,403 --> 00:48:16,531
I want the money.

429
00:48:35,258 --> 00:48:38,694
Miss Lynd will give me the account
number, if she hasn't already.

430
00:48:38,895 --> 00:48:41,261
So all I need from you
is the password.

431
00:48:51,041 --> 00:48:54,272
The password, please.

432
00:48:58,515 --> 00:49:00,813
I've got a little itch...

433
00:49:01,017 --> 00:49:02,882
...down there.

434
00:49:03,653 --> 00:49:05,120
Would you mind?

435
00:49:12,862 --> 00:49:16,263
No! No! No!

436
00:49:17,233 --> 00:49:20,930
No. To the right.
To the right. To the right!

437
00:49:21,137 --> 00:49:23,571
You are a funny man, Mr. Bond.

438
00:49:25,508 --> 00:49:26,998
Yeah!

439
00:49:28,244 --> 00:49:31,543
Yes, yes, yes.

440
00:49:37,220 --> 00:49:42,658
Now the whole world's gonna know
that you died scratching my balls.

441
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:45,951
I died?

442
00:49:46,162 --> 00:49:47,459
-I died?
-Yes.

443
00:49:47,664 --> 00:49:50,633
Because no matter what you do,
I'm not gonna give you the password.

444
00:49:50,834 --> 00:49:52,665
Which means your clients
will hunt you down...

445
00:49:52,869 --> 00:49:55,702
...and cut you into pieces of meat
while you're still breathing.

446
00:49:55,905 --> 00:49:57,304
Because if you kill me...

447
00:49:57,507 --> 00:49:59,566
...there'll be nowhere else to hide.

448
00:49:59,776 --> 00:50:02,574
But you are so wrong!

449
00:50:02,779 --> 00:50:05,771
Because even after I slaughtered
you and your little girlfriend...

450
00:50:05,982 --> 00:50:08,780
...your people would still welcome me
with open arms...

451
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:13,949
...because they need what I know.

452
00:50:15,191 --> 00:50:17,250
The big picture.

453
00:50:25,168 --> 00:50:27,398
Give me the password...

454
00:50:27,604 --> 00:50:29,538
...and I will at least let her live.

455
00:50:33,209 --> 00:50:36,303
Bond. Do it soon enough
and she might even be in one piece.

456
00:50:49,392 --> 00:50:51,519
You really aren't going to tell me,
are you?

457
00:50:51,728 --> 00:50:53,525
No.

458
00:50:55,365 --> 00:50:57,265
So I think...

459
00:51:01,805 --> 00:51:05,241
...l'll feed you
what you seem not to value.

460
00:51:18,388 --> 00:51:20,652
I'll get the money.

461
00:51:21,558 --> 00:51:24,049
Tell them I'll get the money.

462
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:28,720
Money isn't as valuable to our
organization as knowing who to trust.

463
00:51:52,355 --> 00:51:53,754
Francesco.

464
00:51:54,691 --> 00:51:56,591
Francesco.

465
00:52:09,305 --> 00:52:11,432
Vesper.

466
00:52:13,309 --> 00:52:15,209
Vesper.

467
00:52:17,347 --> 00:52:18,871
No.

468
00:52:19,682 --> 00:52:21,013
Not him.

469
00:52:21,217 --> 00:52:23,117
Not Mathis.

470
00:52:24,954 --> 00:52:26,114
No.

471
00:52:26,956 --> 00:52:28,981
I'll get the doctor.

472
00:52:31,761 --> 00:52:33,558
Not him.

473
00:52:35,465 --> 00:52:36,625
Any ideas?

474
00:52:40,370 --> 00:52:44,204
-What?
-Why they left the two of you alive.

475
00:52:46,209 --> 00:52:47,642
Where is she?

476
00:52:48,678 --> 00:52:50,578
Sleeping.

477
00:52:51,181 --> 00:52:54,446
Well, I'm supposed
to get you to drink this.

478
00:52:55,552 --> 00:52:57,213
It's just odd...

479
00:52:57,420 --> 00:53:01,322
...killing everyone else
but leaving you and her untouched.

480
00:53:01,524 --> 00:53:04,857
Almost as if someone
was trying to tell us something.

481
00:53:06,029 --> 00:53:08,156
Get a look at the killer?

482
00:53:08,698 --> 00:53:10,427
No.

483
00:53:11,901 --> 00:53:13,334
Shame.

484
00:53:15,004 --> 00:53:16,733
Drink up.

485
00:53:20,143 --> 00:53:22,304
Anything else you remember?

486
00:53:22,512 --> 00:53:24,537
Anything that can help us?

487
00:53:24,747 --> 00:53:26,374
Help us?

488
00:53:26,583 --> 00:53:28,813
Or help you?

489
00:54:09,192 --> 00:54:10,352
Hello.

490
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:12,391
Hello.

491
00:54:14,097 --> 00:54:15,394
You all right?

492
00:54:16,032 --> 00:54:18,193
I can't resist waking you.

493
00:54:18,401 --> 00:54:23,031
Every time I do, you look at me as if
you haven't seen me in years.

494
00:54:24,173 --> 00:54:26,164
It makes me feel reborn.

495
00:54:29,912 --> 00:54:33,006
If you'd just been born...

496
00:54:33,683 --> 00:54:35,947
...wouldn't you be naked?

497
00:54:36,719 --> 00:54:38,914
You have me there.

498
00:54:41,591 --> 00:54:44,287
You can have me anywhere.

499
00:54:46,362 --> 00:54:47,886
I can?

500
00:54:48,097 --> 00:54:51,965
Yeah. Here, there,
anywhere you like.

501
00:54:52,969 --> 00:54:55,870
Does this mean
that you're warming to me?

502
00:54:56,072 --> 00:54:58,267
Yeah. That's how I would describe it.

503
00:54:58,474 --> 00:54:59,907
It's just that not so long ago...

504
00:55:00,109 --> 00:55:03,977
...I would have described
your feelings towards me as....

505
00:55:05,448 --> 00:55:08,076
I'm trying to think
of a better word than ''loathing.''

506
00:55:08,651 --> 00:55:11,552
I'm afraid I'm a complicated woman.

507
00:55:12,088 --> 00:55:14,579
That is something to be afraid of.

508
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:20,989
-Hello.
-Oh, perfect timing.

509
00:55:22,432 --> 00:55:25,162
Monsieur Mendel.
How are things in Switzerland?

510
00:55:25,368 --> 00:55:27,359
My apologies,
I do not mean to rush...

511
00:55:27,570 --> 00:55:29,561
...but 120 million
is a large sum of money.

512
00:55:29,772 --> 00:55:32,605
It certainly is. You didn't bring
any chocolates with you?

513
00:55:32,809 --> 00:55:34,936
I'm afraid not.

514
00:55:36,145 --> 00:55:39,012
If you would type in
the account number.

515
00:55:46,089 --> 00:55:47,488
And now the password.

516
00:55:48,291 --> 00:55:49,451
You can do that.

517
00:55:50,159 --> 00:55:52,218
I would if I knew what it was.

518
00:55:52,829 --> 00:55:59,200
V-E-S-P-E-R.

519
00:56:10,046 --> 00:56:11,843
The funds have been transferred.

520
00:56:12,048 --> 00:56:14,915
Sorry for disturbing you.

521
00:56:16,753 --> 00:56:19,984
-Auf Wiedersehen.
-Auf Wiedersehen, Herr Mendel.

522
00:56:26,562 --> 00:56:27,961
You know, James...

523
00:56:30,566 --> 00:56:33,467
...I just want you to know
that if all that was left of you...

524
00:56:33,669 --> 00:56:36,968
...was your smile
and your little finger...

525
00:56:37,173 --> 00:56:39,903
...you'd still be more of a man
than anyone I've ever met.

526
00:56:49,318 --> 00:56:52,981
That's because you know
what I can do with my little finger.

527
00:56:55,858 --> 00:56:59,726
-I have no idea.
-But you're aching to find out.

528
00:57:02,999 --> 00:57:06,935
You're not going to let me
in there, are you?

529
00:57:07,670 --> 00:57:09,797
You've got your armor back on.

530
00:57:10,006 --> 00:57:11,234
That's that.

531
00:57:12,742 --> 00:57:15,302
I have no armor left.

532
00:57:16,546 --> 00:57:19,037
You've stripped it from me.

533
00:57:19,916 --> 00:57:22,384
Whatever is left of me....

534
00:57:22,852 --> 00:57:25,719
Whatever is left of me...

535
00:57:26,556 --> 00:57:28,524
...whatever I am...

536
00:57:28,724 --> 00:57:31,215
...l'm yours.

537
00:58:32,655 --> 00:58:35,647
I suppose M won't miss me
for a couple of days.

538
00:58:36,392 --> 00:58:38,223
She'll be too busy sweating Mathis.

539
00:58:38,427 --> 00:58:39,621
Mathis?

540
00:58:39,829 --> 00:58:41,854
Remember I told you
about Le Chiffre's tell?

541
00:58:42,064 --> 00:58:44,498
Well, Mathis told Le Chiffre.

542
00:58:45,067 --> 00:58:46,625
That's how he wiped me out.

543
00:58:46,836 --> 00:58:50,499
Same goes for the implant. Can't say
I'm too sorry about losing that.

544
00:58:50,706 --> 00:58:52,901
I can't believe it.

545
00:58:53,109 --> 00:58:54,701
No, neither could I.

546
00:58:55,177 --> 00:58:57,577
I thought he had my back.

547
00:58:58,247 --> 00:59:00,044
But there you go, lesson learned.

548
00:59:01,450 --> 00:59:03,850
Does everyone have a tell?

549
00:59:05,788 --> 00:59:07,517
Yes.

550
00:59:10,459 --> 00:59:12,222
Everyone.

551
00:59:12,628 --> 00:59:14,459
Everyone except you.

552
00:59:18,935 --> 00:59:20,960
I wonder if that's why I love you.

553
00:59:23,005 --> 00:59:24,939
You love me?

554
00:59:25,474 --> 00:59:27,738
Enough to quit
and float round the world with you...

555
00:59:27,944 --> 00:59:30,139
...until one of us
has to find an honest job.

556
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:34,841
But I think that's gonna have to be you.
I've no idea what an honest job is.

557
00:59:35,751 --> 00:59:37,184
You're serious.

558
00:59:38,154 --> 00:59:40,054
Like you said...

559
00:59:40,623 --> 00:59:42,318
...you do what I do for too long...

560
00:59:42,525 --> 00:59:45,323
...and there won't be any soul
left to salvage.

561
00:59:45,528 --> 00:59:48,395
I'm leaving with
what little I have left.

562
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:52,492
Is that enough for you?

563
01:01:36,839 --> 01:01:38,739
-Come on.
-No. No.

564
01:01:39,241 --> 01:01:42,438
No, stop it. Stop.
I have to get to the bank.

565
01:01:42,645 --> 01:01:44,840
What's the time?

566
01:01:47,083 --> 01:01:49,142
How much do we need
to float for a month?

567
01:01:49,618 --> 01:01:51,381
I've got plenty.

568
01:01:51,587 --> 01:01:55,523
No, I want to pay for my half
of our aimless wanderings.

569
01:01:58,461 --> 01:02:00,793
You stopped wearing the necklace.

570
01:02:00,996 --> 01:02:04,159
Yeah. It was time.

571
01:02:04,366 --> 01:02:07,096
Time enough to get over someone?

572
01:02:11,874 --> 01:02:15,241
To realize sometimes
you can forget the past.

573
01:02:23,953 --> 01:02:25,853
Though apparently not
your employer.

574
01:02:30,292 --> 01:02:33,523
Back in one month.

575
01:02:34,597 --> 01:02:36,997
Come on. I'll get the money...

576
01:02:37,199 --> 01:02:39,360
...you get supplies.

577
01:03:09,031 --> 01:03:11,465
I'll see you back here
in half an hour.

578
01:03:35,958 --> 01:03:38,392
-Hello, M.
-I got your note.

579
01:03:38,594 --> 01:03:40,255
Yes?

580
01:03:40,462 --> 01:03:42,293
We'll talk about that later.

581
01:03:42,498 --> 01:03:45,490
Right now I have a lovely man
from the Treasury here...

582
01:03:45,701 --> 01:03:48,261
...wondering if you're ever
going to deposit the winnings.

583
01:03:51,974 --> 01:03:54,807
That's a shame.
I didn't think they'd miss it.

584
01:03:55,010 --> 01:03:58,309
Yes. Well, I told them not to worry.

585
01:03:58,514 --> 01:04:00,675
So you'll be depositing it today.

586
01:04:01,016 --> 01:04:03,644
On my way to the bank right now.

587
01:04:04,053 --> 01:04:06,749
James Bond for Mr. Mendel.

588
01:04:07,223 --> 01:04:08,383
Hello.

589
01:04:08,591 --> 01:04:11,992
Mr. Mendel? I'm having trouble
accessing the funds in my account.

590
01:04:12,194 --> 01:04:14,025
It was transferred
to the account number...

591
01:04:14,230 --> 01:04:16,528
...your company gave us, Mr. Bond.

592
01:04:19,168 --> 01:04:22,569
It appears the funds
are being withdrawn as we speak.

593
01:04:25,274 --> 01:04:27,105
-Where?
-The Venice branch, of course.

594
01:04:27,309 --> 01:04:28,537
St. Mark's Square.

595
01:04:30,913 --> 01:04:32,608
Is there a problem, Mr. Bond?

596
01:06:45,314 --> 01:06:46,474
I'll kill her!

597
01:06:47,483 --> 01:06:48,677
Allow me.

598
01:11:08,610 --> 01:11:10,578
I'm sorry, James.

599
01:14:22,237 --> 01:14:24,967
She had a boyfriend.
A French Algerian.

600
01:14:25,173 --> 01:14:27,232
They were very much in love.

601
01:14:27,642 --> 01:14:30,770
He was kidnapped
by the organization behind Le Chiffre.

602
01:14:30,979 --> 01:14:35,939
And they blackmailed her, threatening
to kill him unless she cooperated.

603
01:14:36,151 --> 01:14:37,516
We should've picked up on it...

604
01:14:37,719 --> 01:14:39,949
...but sometimes
we're so focused on our enemies...

605
01:14:40,155 --> 01:14:41,679
...we forget to watch our friends.

606
01:14:43,325 --> 01:14:45,190
How are you doing?

607
01:14:45,527 --> 01:14:47,757
She left her cell phone.

608
01:14:47,963 --> 01:14:50,329
She must have known I'd check it.

609
01:14:51,132 --> 01:14:53,293
She knew you were you.

610
01:14:54,369 --> 01:14:56,599
-Well, at least this clears Mathis.
-No.

611
01:14:56,805 --> 01:14:58,432
-No?
-No.

612
01:14:58,640 --> 01:15:01,131
We just proved that she's guilty,
not that he's innocent.

613
01:15:01,343 --> 01:15:03,675
It could've been a double blind.
Keep sweating him.

614
01:15:04,479 --> 01:15:06,242
You don't trust anyone,
do you, James?

615
01:15:06,448 --> 01:15:08,075
No.

616
01:15:08,583 --> 01:15:10,847
Then you've learnt your lesson.

617
01:15:11,653 --> 01:15:13,848
Get back as soon as you can.
We need you.

618
01:15:14,589 --> 01:15:15,749
Will do.

619
01:15:18,026 --> 01:15:19,391
If you do need time....

620
01:15:19,594 --> 01:15:20,856
Why should I need more time?

621
01:15:21,997 --> 01:15:25,262
The job's done,
and the bitch is dead.

622
01:15:26,201 --> 01:15:27,998
James...

623
01:15:28,637 --> 01:15:32,038
...did you ever ask yourself
why you weren't killed that night?

624
01:15:32,641 --> 01:15:34,336
Isn't it obvious?

625
01:15:34,543 --> 01:15:38,502
She made a deal to spare your life
in exchange for the money.

626
01:15:38,713 --> 01:15:40,874
I'm sure she hoped
they would let her live.

627
01:15:42,450 --> 01:15:45,442
But she must have known
she was going to her death.

628
01:15:46,555 --> 01:15:49,490
And now we'll never know
who was behind this.

629
01:15:49,691 --> 01:15:52,251
The trail's gone cold.

630
01:17:19,781 --> 01:17:21,681
-Hello.
-Mr. White?

631
01:17:21,883 --> 01:17:23,373
We need to talk.

632
01:17:23,585 --> 01:17:25,450
Who is this?

633
01:17:55,750 --> 01:17:57,741
The name's Bond.

634
01:17:57,952 --> 01:17:59,886
James Bond.
