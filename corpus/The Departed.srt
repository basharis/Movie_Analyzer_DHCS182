1
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:46,870
I don't wanna be a product
of my environment.

2
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,684
I want my environment
to be a product of me.

3
00:00:55,888 --> 00:00:58,152
Years ago, we had the Church.

4
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:02,953
That was only a way
of saying we had each other.

5
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:07,493
But now, I don't know.
It's a funny thing.

6
00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:09,862
It put hate in your heart.

7
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:13,434
The Knights of Columbus were
real head-breakers.

8
00:01:13,606 --> 00:01:14,834
True guineas.

9
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:17,533
They took over their piece of the city.

10
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:24,109
Twenty years after an Irishman couldn't get
a fucking job...

11
00:01:24,283 --> 00:01:28,413
...we had the presidency.
May he rest in peace.

12
00:01:29,055 --> 00:01:31,888
That's what the niggers don't realize.

13
00:01:32,058 --> 00:01:36,324
If I got one thing
against the black chappies, it's this:

14
00:01:36,496 --> 00:01:38,623
No one gives it to you.

15
00:01:38,798 --> 00:01:40,698
You have to take it.

16
00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:05,921
Vin, don't make me have
to come down here again for this.

17
00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:08,583
Wort happen again, Mr. C.

18
00:02:10,763 --> 00:02:15,029
Carmers developing
into a fine young lady.

19
00:02:15,201 --> 00:02:17,294
You should be proud.

20
00:02:29,682 --> 00:02:32,674
You get your period yet, Carmen?

21
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:50,802
You Johnny Sullivars kid?

22
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:55,970
- You live with your grandmother?
- Yeah.

23
00:02:56,275 --> 00:03:00,507
Vin, get him a couple loaves of bread,
couple half-gallons of milk.

24
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,240
Do you like bologna and cheese?
Give him some cold cuts.

25
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:07,978
Throw some mayo in.
You like comic books?

26
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:11,847
You do good in school?

27
00:03:13,059 --> 00:03:16,995
- Yeah.
- That's good. I did too.

28
00:03:17,163 --> 00:03:19,757
They call that a paradox.

29
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:24,866
Just keep it. Buy yourself some makeup.

30
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:34,638
You ever wanna earn a little extra money,
you come by L Street.

31
00:03:34,814 --> 00:03:37,510
You know where I am on L Street?

32
00:03:37,683 --> 00:03:39,310
Good.

33
00:03:39,485 --> 00:03:42,010
- Good boy.
- Thanks.

34
00:03:44,223 --> 00:03:47,954
To you, O Lord, we commend the soul
of Alphonsus, your servant.

35
00:03:48,127 --> 00:03:50,118
In the sight of this world,
he is now dead.

36
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:53,424
Forgive whatever sins he committed
through human weakness.

37
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,897
- Amen.
- The Church wants you in your place.

38
00:03:56,068 --> 00:03:58,628
Kneel, stand, kneel, stand.

39
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:02,297
If you go for that sort of thing,
I don't know what to do for you.

40
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:04,636
A man makes his own way.

41
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:06,403
No one gives it to you.

42
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:08,444
You have to take it.

43
00:04:10,449 --> 00:04:12,883
- James Joyce.
- Smart, Colin.

44
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:15,517
Guineas from the North End,
down Providence...

45
00:04:15,688 --> 00:04:18,384
...tried to tell me what to do.

46
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:22,324
And something maybe happened to them.

47
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:26,496
Maybe like that:

48
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:37,000
Jeez. She fell funny.

49
00:04:40,012 --> 00:04:42,412
Francis, you really should see somebody.

50
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:45,881
When you decide to be something,
you can be it.

51
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:49,317
That's what they don't tell you
in the Church.

52
00:04:49,488 --> 00:04:54,016
When I was your age, they would say
we could become cops or criminals.

53
00:04:54,193 --> 00:04:56,957
Today what I'm saying to you is this:

54
00:04:57,129 --> 00:05:00,690
When you're facing a loaded gun...

55
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:04,832
...what's the difference?

56
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:09,805
That's my boy.

57
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:13,107
Terminal ballistics is the study
of a projectile...

58
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:15,975
...as it hits a target
and the destruction that it causes.

59
00:05:16,148 --> 00:05:19,242
Take, for instance, what you carry,
9 mm hollow-point.

60
00:05:19,418 --> 00:05:23,047
When the hollow-point hits the skull,
what happens is it mushrooms.

61
00:05:23,222 --> 00:05:26,089
When it mushrooms it peels back.
So you may have six, eight...

62
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:29,422
...ten little particles
of the bullet that are like razor blades...

63
00:05:29,595 --> 00:05:30,721
Sir, yes, sir!

64
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:34,333
- Tearing their internal organs,
their liver, their lungs, their heart...

65
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,061
...bringing tissue, bone, blood,
brain matter, and that's called a blowback.

66
00:05:45,611 --> 00:05:48,136
Fuck you. Fucking queers.

67
00:05:48,314 --> 00:05:52,114
Firemen getting pussy for the first time
in the history of fire or pussy.

68
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:55,982
Hey, go save a kitten in a tree,
you fucking homos.

69
00:05:57,456 --> 00:05:58,946
Pencils.

70
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:05,992
Begin.

71
00:06:13,739 --> 00:06:15,730
What are you looking at?

72
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:19,944
Forget it.

73
00:06:20,112 --> 00:06:23,741
Your father was a janitor,
his sors only a cop.

74
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:30,020
Those fucking firefighters are
a bunch of homos.

75
00:06:30,756 --> 00:06:31,984
They are.

76
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:35,719
So she tells me, "You never finish anything.
You finish the police course...

77
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:41,333
...you get taken care of again, baby."
So after graduation, I get a blowjob again.

78
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,333
That's great.
Your mother must be a wonderful woman.

79
00:06:44,503 --> 00:06:45,527
Fuck yourself.

80
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:48,071
Put it this way.
You're a black guy in Boston.

81
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,800
You don't need any help from me
to be completely fucked.

82
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:54,242
The Massachusetts State Police
has a long tradition of excellence.

83
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,913
Your graduation today solidifies
your acceptance...

84
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:01,178
...into one of the finest law enforcement
agencies in our nation.

85
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:05,120
As the governor of the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts, I am confident...

86
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:10,661
...each and every one of you will serve
with distinction, honor and integrity.

87
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,764
Congratulations to all our new troopers.

88
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:16,026
Thank you. You are dismissed.

89
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:30,241
Sullivan, assigned to plainclothes right out
of the gate, congratulations.

90
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:34,182
- We're going for a beer. You wanna come?
- No, I'll catch up with you guys.

91
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:45,121
School's out.

92
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:48,834
Thank you, Frank.

93
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:50,625
You earned it.

94
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:53,863
No more pencils, no more books.

95
00:07:56,575 --> 00:07:57,564
All right.

96
00:07:57,743 --> 00:07:59,267
This is not the regular police...

97
00:07:59,445 --> 00:08:01,345
...this is the state police.
- And fire!

98
00:08:01,547 --> 00:08:03,640
Your training will illustrate the difference.

99
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:06,512
State police, search warrant!
State police, open the door!

100
00:08:06,685 --> 00:08:08,050
What's the difference?

101
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,620
- Go, go, go!
- Sir, yes, sir!

102
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:13,850
- Is that understood?
- Sir, yes, sir!

103
00:08:14,026 --> 00:08:17,189
Move it, get the fuck down right now.
Get down, right now.

104
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:31,108
Congratulations on passing
the detective's exam, and welcome...

105
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:34,769
...to the Special Investigation Unit.
- Whoop-de-fucking-do.

106
00:08:35,414 --> 00:08:37,814
We won't be working together,
that is, directly.

107
00:08:37,983 --> 00:08:41,817
You'll be working for Captain Ellerby,
but I like to see everybody.

108
00:08:43,722 --> 00:08:46,486
You're a worker. You rise fast.

109
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:48,650
Like a 12-year-old's dick.

110
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:52,857
- Thank you, sergeant.
- My pleasure.

111
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:55,398
- Thank you, sir.
- Good luck.

112
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:04,801
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, hon.

113
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:09,604
You can go in there now.

114
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:17,515
You can sit.

115
00:09:22,795 --> 00:09:24,194
So...

116
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:28,131
Do you know what we do here?
My section?

117
00:09:30,402 --> 00:09:33,098
- Yes, sir, I have an idea...
- Let's say you have no idea...

118
00:09:33,305 --> 00:09:34,966
...and leave it at that, okay?

119
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:37,632
No idea. Zip. None.

120
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:41,736
If you had an idea what we do, we would
not be good at what we do, would we?

121
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:43,438
We would be cunts.

122
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:45,641
Are you calling us cunts?

123
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:48,218
Staff Sergeant Dignam
has a style of his own.

124
00:09:48,387 --> 00:09:51,322
I'm afraid we all have to get used to it.

125
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:55,951
So you have family connections down
in Southie, right? Through your father?

126
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:58,653
Why don't you tell us
about your Uncle Jackie?

127
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:05,470
He was a carpet layer for Jordan Marsh.

128
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:09,937
Uncle Jackie was a small-time bookie
who tended bar at the Vets in Somerville.

129
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:13,840
He got popped by Nicastro in '95.
We found his body out by the airport.

130
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,946
That's right.

131
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:20,509
- I remember his funeral.
- Oh, good.

132
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,915
Closed casket?

133
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:26,353
That's right.

134
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:28,894
So tell anybody up at Deerfield...

135
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:32,189
Before you got kicked out for whaling
on a gym teacher with a chair.

136
00:10:32,364 --> 00:10:34,764
- You had an uncle met his demise
like that?

137
00:10:39,238 --> 00:10:40,705
I got a question.

138
00:10:40,873 --> 00:10:42,932
How fucked up are you?

139
00:10:54,253 --> 00:10:56,346
Hi, Darlene.

140
00:10:58,557 --> 00:11:02,755
What you got, staff sergeant?
In no time you made sergeant.

141
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:07,732
- SIU. What a country.
- Perfect.

142
00:11:09,668 --> 00:11:11,863
Hey, I don't mind going it alone.

143
00:11:12,037 --> 00:11:15,165
You know, if you went alone once
in a while you might get somewhere.

144
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:18,003
We're cops, all right?
This isn't somewhere.

145
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:22,913
All right, lookit, I know you're a worker.
Maybe I can do something for you.

146
00:11:23,415 --> 00:11:25,178
You got any suits,
or do you like...

147
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:28,184
...coming to work dressed like
you're gonna invade Poland?

148
00:11:30,422 --> 00:11:33,186
You got quite the family tree.
That maggot uncle of yours...

149
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:36,726
...Tommy Costigan, is another goof.
He gets busted selling guns...

150
00:11:36,895 --> 00:11:39,921
...to federal officers, among many,
many, many other departures...

151
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:43,432
...from our normative behavior.
- And what's this got to do with me?

152
00:11:43,602 --> 00:11:45,365
Why are you pretending to be a cop?

153
00:11:49,341 --> 00:11:52,708
This unit is new, and you are
the newest members of it.

154
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:56,439
You have been selected for it
on the basis of intelligence and aptitude.

155
00:11:56,615 --> 00:11:59,709
This is an elite unit.

156
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:04,151
Our job is to smash
or marginally disrupt...

157
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:06,382
...organized crime in this city...

158
00:12:06,558 --> 00:12:09,288
...by enanced cooperation
with the FBI...

159
00:12:09,461 --> 00:12:12,225
...represented here today
by Agent Frank Lazio.

160
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,559
And we will do it.

161
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:18,191
And by organized crime in this city,
you know who we mean.

162
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:20,665
That's Jackie Costigan.
That's an old picture.

163
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:22,898
Jackie met his demise.

164
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:25,005
Last known photograph.

165
00:12:26,612 --> 00:12:28,637
Costello uses three key guys.

166
00:12:28,814 --> 00:12:32,341
That's Fitzy. Off-the-boat psycho,
lives in Brockton with his mother.

167
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:35,214
She's straight out of Going My Way.

168
00:12:35,387 --> 00:12:37,480
Delahunt, muscle.

169
00:12:37,656 --> 00:12:41,615
French, the number one.
But of course, the rock star, you-know-who.

170
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:44,524
We've done a briefing book, so read up.
I want all ideas...

171
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:46,858
...so I can pass them off as my own.

172
00:12:47,032 --> 00:12:50,160
Work hard, you'll rise fast.
You're in the best possible position...

173
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:52,099
...in the department.
Let's go to work.

174
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:54,568
Your old man was a fucking hump
from Southie.

175
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:57,709
Baggage handler at the airport, right?

176
00:12:57,876 --> 00:13:00,344
Family's all criminals except
for the old man, huh?

177
00:13:00,512 --> 00:13:02,980
And one priest, since you seem
to know everything.

178
00:13:03,148 --> 00:13:07,016
Last I heard he was married to a 12-year-old
boy, living on a beach in Thailand.

179
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:10,087
Fucking family's dug
into the Southie projects like ticks.

180
00:13:10,255 --> 00:13:12,553
Three-decker men at best.
You, however, grew up...

181
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:16,593
...on the North Shore, huh?
Well, la-di-fucking-da.

182
00:13:16,762 --> 00:13:18,992
You were kind of a double kid,
I bet, right?

183
00:13:19,698 --> 00:13:22,098
One kid with your old man,
one kid with your mother.

184
00:13:22,267 --> 00:13:25,532
You're upper-middle class during the weeks,
then you're hanging...

185
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:28,673
...in the Southie projects
with your daddy, the fucking donkey...

186
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:31,332
...on the weekends. I got that right?

187
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:35,274
Yup.
You have different accents?

188
00:13:35,814 --> 00:13:38,339
You did, didn't you,
you little fucking snake?

189
00:13:38,517 --> 00:13:41,748
- You were like different people.
- You a psychiatrist?

190
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,889
If I was, I'd ask you
why you're a statie making 30 grand a year.

191
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:48,549
And I think if I was Sigmund fucking Freud
I wouldn't get an answer.

192
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:53,790
Tell me, what's a lace-curtain motherfucker
like you doing in the staties?

193
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,292
Well, families are always rising
or falling in America, am I right?

194
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:01,098
- Who said that?
- Hawthorne.

195
00:14:02,107 --> 00:14:05,565
What's the matter, smart-ass,
you don't know any fucking Shakespeare?

196
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,910
We have a question.

197
00:14:12,084 --> 00:14:16,748
Do you wanna be a cop,
or do you wanna appear to be a cop?

198
00:14:16,922 --> 00:14:18,219
It's an honest question.

199
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:22,053
Lot of guys want to appear to be cops.
Gun, badge, pretend they're on TV.

200
00:14:22,227 --> 00:14:24,855
A lot of them just wanna slam a nigger
through a window...

201
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,828
I'm set without your
own personal job application, sergeant.

202
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,264
- What did you say?
- Sir, what do you want from me?

203
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:31,527
Hey, he can't help you.

204
00:14:31,703 --> 00:14:33,671
I know what you are.
I know what you are...

205
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,204
...and I know what you're not.

206
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:38,810
I'm the best friend you have and I'm gonna
help you understand something.

207
00:14:38,977 --> 00:14:40,945
You're no fucking cop.

208
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:45,642
He's right.
We deal in deception here.

209
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:48,651
What we do not deal with
is self-deception.

210
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:51,654
Five years from now you could be
anything else in the world.

211
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:55,419
But you will not be
a Massachusetts state trooper.

212
00:14:56,094 --> 00:14:58,255
- Are you sure of that?
- I'm sure of that.

213
00:14:58,430 --> 00:14:59,522
Guaran-fucking-teed.

214
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:06,430
You had 1400 on your SATs, kid.
You're an astronaut, not a statie.

215
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:10,535
You don't have much family.

216
00:15:11,009 --> 00:15:13,204
I don't have any family.

217
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:22,219
What's this I hear from Stephanie
about you becoming a policeman?

218
00:15:22,387 --> 00:15:25,322
Stephanie, who was the only one
who came to my father's funeral?

219
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:28,892
- That Stephanie?
- Yeah, that Stephanie.

220
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:32,895
- Nothing much to it, Uncle Edward.
- Trying to prove something to the family?

221
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:38,059
When you say "the family,"
who do you mean exactly? You?

222
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:41,471
You always have to question everything,
don't you?

223
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:45,667
Maybe it would've done you some good
to have some questions from time to time.

224
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:48,540
"Am I an asshole?
Are my kids a mess?

225
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:53,413
Is my wife a money-grubbing whore?"
I mean, those are questions, right?

226
00:15:53,585 --> 00:15:58,352
"Have I ever been good to my dying sister,
or am I just now pretending to be?"

227
00:16:02,561 --> 00:16:05,496
Do you need some money for the funeral?

228
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:11,528
When my mother dies,
we don't have any more connection.

229
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:17,133
It's lovely. You get the high ceilings,
the parquet floors. Bathroom is massive.

230
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:19,937
The fridge has got an alarm in it
in case you have...

231
00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:23,343
...eating issues, which is a joke.
Not a very funny one.

232
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:27,474
Well, there's a great view of the
State House. Beacon Hill, you can see it.

233
00:16:28,086 --> 00:16:31,055
I mean, you move in,
you're upper-class by about Tuesday.

234
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:35,788
- So you're a cop.
- A state-police detective.

235
00:16:35,961 --> 00:16:37,792
A state-police detective.

236
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:41,298
And are you a married
state-police detective?

237
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:42,966
No.

238
00:16:43,902 --> 00:16:46,564
Because this is kind of a...
Sort of a big place and...

239
00:16:46,738 --> 00:16:48,763
I have a co-signer.

240
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:53,635
Oh, cool. Yeah, you intend
to have a houseguest. That's cool. Good.

241
00:16:53,812 --> 00:16:56,110
- Yeah, it's got...
- Just give me the papers.

242
00:16:57,049 --> 00:16:58,744
Sure.

243
00:16:59,217 --> 00:17:04,052
Eternal rest grant unto her, O Lord,
and let perpetual light shine upon her.

244
00:17:04,222 --> 00:17:06,747
- Amen.
- May she rest in peace. Amen.

245
00:17:06,925 --> 00:17:10,122
May her soul and the souls
of all the faithful departed...

246
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:13,492
...through the mercy of God
rest in peace.

247
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,463
Amen.

248
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:39,889
So what do I do?

249
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:44,025
There's money behind this operation.
You won't be paid as a regular cop...

250
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:46,289
...but there's a bonus involved.

251
00:17:46,898 --> 00:17:48,798
Tax-free.

252
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:54,704
We can't conceal that you were a trainee.
You'll be convicted of a crime.

253
00:17:54,873 --> 00:17:58,604
We're thinking a guilty plea
to assault and battery would make sense.

254
00:17:58,777 --> 00:17:59,835
Given your nature.

255
00:18:00,045 --> 00:18:03,014
You'll do enough jail time
to convince anyone this is no setup.

256
00:18:03,181 --> 00:18:05,706
You'll be on probation,
see a court-ordered shrink...

257
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:07,579
...the whole nine yards.

258
00:18:09,054 --> 00:18:12,080
You wanna serve the Commonwealth,
this is your chance.

259
00:18:13,091 --> 00:18:14,615
We need you, pal.

260
00:18:14,793 --> 00:18:17,660
You've already pretended
to be a Costigan from South Boston.

261
00:18:17,829 --> 00:18:21,788
- Every weekend, sergeant.
- Perfect.

262
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:25,299
Do it again.

263
00:18:26,471 --> 00:18:28,132
For me.

264
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:05,376
- Hey, you Billy Costigan?
- Yeah, who wants to know?

265
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:08,445
Well, nothing.
I know a Sean Costigan down on L Street.

266
00:19:08,613 --> 00:19:11,946
- Yeah, that's my cousin.
- Connected. Not too bright.

267
00:19:12,117 --> 00:19:14,779
- Yeah, I know.
- I mean, no offense.

268
00:19:31,803 --> 00:19:33,634
- Billy?
- Yeah, it's me.

269
00:19:33,805 --> 00:19:36,740
- Oh, my God. Good to see you.
- Aunt Kathy, how are you?

270
00:19:36,908 --> 00:19:39,900
Oh, good to see you. Come on in.

271
00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:44,245
They said you was in the staties.
I couldn't believe it.

272
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:46,680
I got kicked out, like, four months ago.

273
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:49,082
Yeah, it was in the papers.

274
00:19:50,922 --> 00:19:52,617
So you know.

275
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:55,624
And why are we graced
with your presence?

276
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:58,596
I brought your mother
some pictures of my father.

277
00:19:58,764 --> 00:20:01,892
- Look at the smile.
- My mother had them. My...

278
00:20:03,502 --> 00:20:04,696
My mother's dead.

279
00:20:06,204 --> 00:20:09,264
I'm sorry.
Sorry for your troubles.

280
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:12,001
I was at a funeral myself, man.

281
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:15,178
Myles Kennefick.
Knew him in school.

282
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:19,609
He was a young guy, you know?
It's terrible. It's a shame.

283
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:21,946
- You remember that. What a night.
- Listen.

284
00:20:23,955 --> 00:20:25,445
I got, like...

285
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:29,082
- Like 30,000 bucks, right? Insurance money.
- Yeah.

286
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:32,025
You know, after my mother passed
and everything.

287
00:20:32,197 --> 00:20:34,859
In your line of work, if I gave you...

288
00:20:35,033 --> 00:20:38,730
...like, what, say, 10,000,
what could I get back?

289
00:20:40,438 --> 00:20:42,269
You know what you...

290
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,772
You know what you usually say
at these moments.

291
00:20:44,943 --> 00:20:49,039
- What? What?
- Come on, man.

292
00:20:49,214 --> 00:20:53,116
Oh, come on, you fucking moron.
Come on.

293
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:54,912
What, you want me to say it?

294
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:01,625
I'm not a cop, all right?

295
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:05,960
- I'm your fucking cousin.
- You're bad.

296
00:21:06,865 --> 00:21:09,925
You corrupt fuck, man.
You must be my cousin.

297
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:14,663
Fucking Ricans think
they know everything.

298
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:18,367
If they knew shit,
they wouldn't be Puerto Ricans.

299
00:21:18,577 --> 00:21:22,013
R is for Ricans
P is for pigs

300
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:25,274
Would you shut the fuck up
for five seconds, huh?

301
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:28,419
That's right. You used to be a cop.

302
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:32,021
When we're working together
just limit it to two eight-balls an hour.

303
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:35,648
We're not even supposed to be doing
this shit this close to Worcester.

304
00:21:35,827 --> 00:21:37,260
This side of Worcester.

305
00:21:37,996 --> 00:21:41,159
- Says who?
- Says him. Says Costello.

306
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,324
God says, as far as you're...

307
00:21:44,002 --> 00:21:45,333
...concerned.

308
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,375
No, no, he's no cop. He got out
of the joint three weeks ago.

309
00:21:51,543 --> 00:21:53,909
- Cunt cop.
- No, no, no.

310
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:56,843
He talks like his shit don't stink,
but he's good people.

311
00:21:57,015 --> 00:21:59,483
Well, I knew his father.

312
00:21:59,784 --> 00:22:02,378
- I liked his Uncle Jackie better.
- Jackie was all right.

313
00:22:02,554 --> 00:22:05,045
Uncle Jackie was excellent.

314
00:22:05,223 --> 00:22:07,191
Fucking guineas.

315
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:09,859
- To Jackie.
- Uncle Jackie.

316
00:22:11,129 --> 00:22:13,120
Cranberry juice.

317
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,460
It's a natural diuretic.

318
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:19,832
My girlfriend drinks it
when she's got her period.

319
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:22,937
What, do you got your period?

320
00:22:27,145 --> 00:22:29,579
- Fucking...!
- Get off!

321
00:22:32,651 --> 00:22:36,382
- Get your fucking hands off me!
- Hey. Hey, hey.

322
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:39,448
Do you know me?

323
00:22:39,724 --> 00:22:41,487
No. No.

324
00:22:42,994 --> 00:22:45,861
Well, I'm the guy that tells you
there are guys you can hit...

325
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:48,022
...and there's guys you can't.

326
00:22:48,199 --> 00:22:50,190
Now, that's not quite a guy
you can't hit...

327
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:52,632
...but it's almost a guy you can't hit.

328
00:22:52,804 --> 00:22:55,466
So I'm gonna make a fucking ruling
on this right now:

329
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:58,666
You don't fucking hit him.
You understand?

330
00:23:01,479 --> 00:23:04,039
Yeah, excellent. Fine. Fine, fine.

331
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:09,145
I fucking know you. I know your family.

332
00:23:09,688 --> 00:23:11,280
You make one more drug deal...

333
00:23:11,456 --> 00:23:14,289
...with that idiot fucking cop-magnet
of a cousin of yours...

334
00:23:15,093 --> 00:23:17,755
...and I'll forget your grandmother was
so nice to me.

335
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:21,023
I'll cut your fucking nuts off.
You understand that?

336
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:25,932
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

337
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:29,363
What are you drinking?

338
00:23:36,214 --> 00:23:38,341
A cranberry juice.

339
00:23:39,684 --> 00:23:41,811
What is it, your period?

340
00:23:44,856 --> 00:23:48,087
Get him a cranberry juice.

341
00:23:54,632 --> 00:23:56,657
Hey, fuckhead, that's Jackie's nephew.

342
00:23:58,269 --> 00:24:00,499
What? "Oh," fucking what?

343
00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:05,640
Get the fuck out of here.

344
00:24:06,011 --> 00:24:07,478
Sorry I'm late.

345
00:24:07,645 --> 00:24:10,580
Staff Sergeant Dignam is our liaison
to the undercover section.

346
00:24:10,749 --> 00:24:12,341
His undercover work is extensive.

347
00:24:12,517 --> 00:24:14,747
He's here to give us his report.
Sergeant Dignam.

348
00:24:14,919 --> 00:24:17,149
Okay, my people are out there.

349
00:24:17,322 --> 00:24:19,882
They're like fucking Indians.
You're not gonna see them.

350
00:24:20,058 --> 00:24:22,492
You'll hear about them
through me or Captain Queenan.

351
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:25,493
You will not ever know the identity
of undercover people.

352
00:24:25,663 --> 00:24:28,598
Unfortunately, this shithole has more
leaks than the Iraqi navy.

353
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:31,031
- Fuck yourself.
- I'm tired from fucking your wife.

354
00:24:31,202 --> 00:24:33,466
- How's your mother?
- Tired from fucking my father.

355
00:24:34,005 --> 00:24:35,472
Good. Today, girls...

356
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,540
...what I have is microprocessors.

357
00:24:38,743 --> 00:24:42,042
Somebody, as you may already know,
stole 20 microprocessors...

358
00:24:42,213 --> 00:24:44,773
...from the Mass Processor Company
out on Route 128.

359
00:24:44,949 --> 00:24:47,213
These are the kind
they put into computers...

360
00:24:47,385 --> 00:24:50,218
...that could put a cruise missile
up the ass of a camel...

361
00:24:50,388 --> 00:24:52,219
...from a couple hundred miles away.

362
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:55,223
These pieces of plastic are won'th
about 100 grand apiece.

363
00:24:55,393 --> 00:24:57,953
We got a guy working
for the company two months...

364
00:24:58,129 --> 00:25:01,064
...walks out the door with
a box of processors on Tuesday...

365
00:25:01,232 --> 00:25:03,291
...has a ticket for Florida
on Wednesday...

366
00:25:03,468 --> 00:25:05,834
...but on Thursday, he gets found
in a Dumpster.

367
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:08,165
You know where that dirtball
started his life?

368
00:25:08,339 --> 00:25:09,897
Southie projects.

369
00:25:10,075 --> 00:25:12,737
- What was his name, the departed?
- Myles Kennefick.

370
00:25:12,911 --> 00:25:15,937
Got the job with a forged UMass
transcript. UMass, Boston...

371
00:25:16,114 --> 00:25:17,843
...which happens to...
- South Boston?

372
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:21,076
Oh, you're a fucking genius.
Who forged your transcript, dickhead?

373
00:25:21,252 --> 00:25:24,449
His old man runs
the Hibernian Liquor Mart. Kennefick's.

374
00:25:26,791 --> 00:25:29,351
We're not here to solve
the case of the missing scumbag.

375
00:25:29,527 --> 00:25:30,960
We're here to nail Costello.

376
00:25:31,129 --> 00:25:32,596
All right, look. We got a guy...

377
00:25:32,764 --> 00:25:35,289
...says Costello's moving
the processors to China.

378
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:37,935
He set up the whole fucking job
and popped Kennefick.

379
00:25:38,103 --> 00:25:40,503
You do not want to miss it
if Costello takes a dump.

380
00:25:40,672 --> 00:25:44,108
We'd miss less if you made your
informants available to us and the Bureau.

381
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:48,006
Without asking for too many details,
do you have anyone in with Costello now?

382
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,778
Maybe. Maybe not.

383
00:25:50,949 --> 00:25:52,644
Maybe fuck yourself.

384
00:25:52,817 --> 00:25:55,149
My theory on Feds
is they're like mushrooms.

385
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,220
Feed them shit
and keep them in the dark.

386
00:25:57,388 --> 00:25:59,015
You girls have a good day.

387
00:25:59,824 --> 00:26:03,487
Normally he's a very nice guy.

388
00:26:03,661 --> 00:26:05,561
Don't judge him from this meeting alone.

389
00:26:08,633 --> 00:26:11,796
Now, Mrs. Kennefick, I knew your son.

390
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:13,699
I knew Myles.

391
00:26:13,872 --> 00:26:16,705
He was younger than me,
but he was behind me in school.

392
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:19,036
I wanna get these people
who did this to him.

393
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:22,202
Would you like to help us?
You wanna help catch the people...

394
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:25,213
...who forced your son to do a robbery
and then killed him?

395
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:27,215
Allegedly.

396
00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:29,381
Allegedly.

397
00:26:29,554 --> 00:26:32,022
If he was killed,
he probably did something wrong.

398
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:34,158
But not the robbery. That's not wrong.

399
00:26:34,325 --> 00:26:36,384
He did something else wrong?

400
00:26:38,663 --> 00:26:41,689
Wave to your girlfriend, honey.

401
00:26:43,535 --> 00:26:45,730
I mean, fuck yourself.

402
00:26:47,372 --> 00:26:49,840
- Did you get that?
- "Allegedly" or "fuck yourself"?

403
00:26:50,008 --> 00:26:53,444
- Welcome to the neighborhood.
- Different breed down here, sarge.

404
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:56,413
I need a cup of coffee.

405
00:27:10,161 --> 00:27:12,425
You making a house call?

406
00:27:13,064 --> 00:27:15,055
Have I seen you professionally?

407
00:27:15,233 --> 00:27:18,725
No, no. No, I know who you are, though.
I know.

408
00:27:18,903 --> 00:27:22,566
Guys gotta use their service revolver
in the course of duty...

409
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:26,335
...and then they get to come to talk
to you about their feelings and whatnot.

410
00:27:26,511 --> 00:27:30,345
No, no, I know how it goes.
You're a mental health professional.

411
00:27:30,515 --> 00:27:32,176
I have an appointment on this floor.

412
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:35,808
Oh, well, you'll have fun. They're all
frigging crazy on that floor.

413
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:38,080
- I'm one more up.
- Oh, fancy policeman.

414
00:27:38,256 --> 00:27:40,349
- Yeah, that's right, fancy.
- Are you a statie?

415
00:27:40,525 --> 00:27:43,653
Yeah, I am. I'm actually
going to law school also.

416
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:45,125
Suffolk, nights?

417
00:27:45,296 --> 00:27:48,163
Yeah, they don't run Harvard
at night, last time I checked.

418
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:51,825
- Whers the last time you checked?
- Before I went to fucking Suffolk.

419
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:54,767
Okay, listen, I went to UMass.
I wasrt insulting you.

420
00:27:54,939 --> 00:27:57,601
Well, I thought you were.
So now you gotta buy me dinner.

421
00:27:57,775 --> 00:28:00,573
Maybe you can shoot someone
and then see me professionally.

422
00:28:00,745 --> 00:28:05,842
I'll stab someone in the heart with a fucking
ice pick if it gets me dinner with you.

423
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:08,247
That's all right. I'm a detective.
I'll find you.

424
00:28:08,419 --> 00:28:11,445
No, sorry. I'm just joking.
I need the card. Card helps.

425
00:28:11,623 --> 00:28:13,113
Nice to meet you, Madolyn.

426
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:26,731
Hi, Dad. I had no idea about the tail
until I saw it.

427
00:28:26,904 --> 00:28:29,737
No, I couldn't.
I had the other guy with me, I couldn't...

428
00:28:29,907 --> 00:28:33,035
All right, it's a blue sedan
and then a white van.

429
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:36,339
It's fucked up with graffiti.
And the van is the audio surveillance.

430
00:28:36,514 --> 00:28:37,811
All right, have a nice day.

431
00:28:39,083 --> 00:28:40,812
Cut him here.

432
00:28:41,586 --> 00:28:43,053
Bye-bye.

433
00:28:47,292 --> 00:28:48,316
Jerk-ass!

434
00:28:48,493 --> 00:28:51,155
Come on, Babu. I can't do anymore.
I cannot hold off.

435
00:28:51,329 --> 00:28:54,856
Don't let me go back empty-handed.
Don't do this. I wanna help you.

436
00:28:55,033 --> 00:28:58,002
Come to my store next Friday.
I'll give you the money.

437
00:28:58,169 --> 00:29:00,660
This is Friday, Babu.
How many times I gotta tell you?

438
00:29:00,838 --> 00:29:03,864
You keep on calling me Babu.
It's Singh, motherfucker.

439
00:29:04,042 --> 00:29:05,270
I'm trying to help you.

440
00:29:05,443 --> 00:29:08,879
You keep telling me I'm your friend.
You don't even know my fucking name.

441
00:29:09,047 --> 00:29:12,505
I'm gonna catch a beating if I go back
again like last week.

442
00:29:12,684 --> 00:29:16,142
See this guy? You see this guy?
This guy don't want you to have the money.

443
00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:19,154
Because he wants to come back there
and squash your head.

444
00:29:19,324 --> 00:29:21,758
I have one customer sitting here.
What I'm gonna do?

445
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:24,793
Business is bad? You opened a store
in an Irish neighborhood.

446
00:29:24,962 --> 00:29:27,192
These are dirty people.
Don't you know that?

447
00:29:27,365 --> 00:29:29,595
Sell potatoes,
I don't know what you're gonna do.

448
00:29:29,767 --> 00:29:32,861
- Excuse me, gentlemen. Excuse me. Sorry.
- Know what I'm saying?

449
00:29:33,037 --> 00:29:34,561
You fellas come from Providence?

450
00:29:34,739 --> 00:29:36,798
It isn't any of your business, is it, now?

451
00:29:36,974 --> 00:29:39,499
What, are you fucking delivering
cannolis or something?

452
00:29:49,354 --> 00:29:52,517
Hey! You are killing my business, man!

453
00:29:53,257 --> 00:29:54,451
Fuck!

454
00:29:54,625 --> 00:29:57,788
What's wrong with this fucking country?
Everybody hates everybody!

455
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:05,068
Get out of here. Get out of here!

456
00:30:11,709 --> 00:30:15,406
- Now, you also do probation work, right?
- That's right, I see violent offenders.

457
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:19,641
- Oh, bad guys.
- Not necessarily.

458
00:30:25,356 --> 00:30:28,291
Yeah, they got this but they don't got
duck I'orange.

459
00:30:28,459 --> 00:30:30,017
Was your meal okay?

460
00:30:30,194 --> 00:30:31,752
Yeah, no, the lobster was good.

461
00:30:31,929 --> 00:30:35,330
I just, you know, because it was
a French restaurant I was surprised.

462
00:30:41,038 --> 00:30:42,835
I'm waiting for you to make your move.

463
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:45,942
Look, I don't know, if that thing moves,
I'm gonna shoot it.

464
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:47,475
I don't even know what it is.

465
00:30:54,786 --> 00:30:57,584
So what's it like having people
find themselves...

466
00:30:57,755 --> 00:30:59,620
...in your office all day long?

467
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:02,419
Does it get messy with all those
feelings flying around?

468
00:31:03,761 --> 00:31:06,127
Why, does that make you
uncomfortable?

469
00:31:06,297 --> 00:31:07,696
- No, no, no.
- No?

470
00:31:07,865 --> 00:31:10,197
No, no, no. No, I'm not on your couch.

471
00:31:11,569 --> 00:31:13,764
Well, you know what Freud said
about the Irish?

472
00:31:13,938 --> 00:31:15,337
Yeah, I do.

473
00:31:15,907 --> 00:31:18,671
Yeah, if you actually do,
I'll see you again.

474
00:31:19,644 --> 00:31:22,477
Who says I wanna see you again?

475
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:28,113
Don't you?

476
00:31:29,854 --> 00:31:31,754
- You should see your face.
- Don't you?

477
00:31:31,923 --> 00:31:33,356
Course I wanna see you again.

478
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:36,083
What Freud said about the Irish is...

479
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:40,526
...we're the only people who are
impervious to psychoanalysis.

480
00:31:41,499 --> 00:31:43,831
- Yeah, he said that.
- I know he did.

481
00:31:44,001 --> 00:31:47,164
So you're up shit's creek with a client list
full of mick cops.

482
00:31:47,338 --> 00:31:49,329
I mean, opening up? Good luck to you.

483
00:31:49,507 --> 00:31:51,668
Why do you do it, then?

484
00:31:52,877 --> 00:31:55,004
Some people do get better.

485
00:31:58,015 --> 00:31:59,346
Fair enough.

486
00:31:59,517 --> 00:32:03,214
Sometimes I want people to forget
their personal bullshit and do their jobs.

487
00:32:04,188 --> 00:32:05,416
Including the criminals?

488
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,854
If they don't do their jobs,
you don't have one.

489
00:32:08,626 --> 00:32:11,754
I'll always have a job.
I'll just arrest innocent people.

490
00:32:13,164 --> 00:32:15,758
- Wait. You are trouble.
- You don't know the half of it.

491
00:32:15,933 --> 00:32:18,026
I'll arrest you right now.

492
00:32:19,237 --> 00:32:21,137
My word against yours.

493
00:32:21,706 --> 00:32:25,233
- Then I see her dancing at the wedding
with you-know-who.

494
00:32:26,544 --> 00:32:28,444
I say, "Why don't you
go to Parents Without Partners?"

495
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:32,640
He goes, "Ma, they're all losers
at the Parents Without Partners," so...

496
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:37,719
So I say to him,
"Princess Carolina of Monaco..."

497
00:32:40,424 --> 00:32:41,755
Schuyler.

498
00:32:55,439 --> 00:32:57,737
Do you know who I am?

499
00:33:00,978 --> 00:33:02,502
No.

500
00:33:06,517 --> 00:33:10,851
You met my friend Mr. French
the other night.

501
00:33:20,998 --> 00:33:23,523
His real name Mr. French?

502
00:33:26,437 --> 00:33:28,098
No.

503
00:33:31,709 --> 00:33:33,677
Come with me.

504
00:33:38,215 --> 00:33:42,481
I'm not the cops. I'm not asking you.

505
00:33:44,589 --> 00:33:49,151
You know something, they just do not stop
having the Mafia in Providence.

506
00:33:49,327 --> 00:33:53,195
And this can cause me a lot of problems.

507
00:33:59,236 --> 00:34:02,103
Those guys you tuned up...

508
00:34:02,273 --> 00:34:04,434
...they're connected down Providence.

509
00:34:05,943 --> 00:34:07,342
What they're gonna do...

510
00:34:07,511 --> 00:34:11,106
...is come back with some guys
and kill you.

511
00:34:11,282 --> 00:34:14,308
Which, sure as you're born,
they will do.

512
00:34:14,485 --> 00:34:16,885
Unless I stop them.

513
00:34:17,154 --> 00:34:19,122
Do you want me to stop them?

514
00:34:22,259 --> 00:34:24,489
Is this something I can't do personally?

515
00:34:28,366 --> 00:34:30,163
I'm gonna have my associate search you.

516
00:34:30,334 --> 00:34:32,632
No one's searching me.
Search me for what?

517
00:34:32,803 --> 00:34:35,533
Contra-fucking-band.
Take your shoes off.

518
00:34:36,107 --> 00:34:37,574
Shoes.

519
00:34:44,215 --> 00:34:45,705
I knew your father.

520
00:34:47,852 --> 00:34:52,016
Yeah? Do you know he's dead?

521
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:55,859
Oh, sorry. How'd he go?

522
00:34:56,627 --> 00:34:59,687
- Stand.
- He didn't complain.

523
00:34:59,864 --> 00:35:02,594
Yeah, that was his problem.

524
00:35:03,234 --> 00:35:04,599
Who said he had a problem?

525
00:35:06,904 --> 00:35:09,429
I just said he had a fucking problem.

526
00:35:10,741 --> 00:35:13,073
There's a man could've been anything.

527
00:35:13,244 --> 00:35:15,644
Are you trying to say
that he was nothing?

528
00:35:15,813 --> 00:35:19,249
- Fuck.
- I'm saying he worked at the airport.

529
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:21,282
- He's clean.
- Arm.

530
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:22,714
Yeah, come on.

531
00:35:22,887 --> 00:35:24,411
What arm? What fucking arm?

532
00:35:24,588 --> 00:35:27,921
Show me your arm. Flip it.

533
00:35:34,732 --> 00:35:38,259
Makes me curious to see you
in this neighborhood.

534
00:35:40,004 --> 00:35:41,335
He's clean.

535
00:35:41,505 --> 00:35:44,770
And if I can slander my own
environment...

536
00:35:44,942 --> 00:35:48,742
...it makes me sad, this regression.

537
00:35:48,913 --> 00:35:53,873
Plus, I don't know if it's beyond some
fucking cop prick like Queenan...

538
00:35:54,051 --> 00:35:58,351
...to pull you out of the staties
and send you after me.

539
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:01,456
I just can't know.

540
00:36:01,926 --> 00:36:06,124
I don't know what they do
in that particular department, anyway.

541
00:36:07,431 --> 00:36:10,525
- Are you still a cop?
- No! No!

542
00:36:11,068 --> 00:36:14,037
Swear on your mother's grave
you're still not a cop?

543
00:36:14,205 --> 00:36:17,038
I am not a fucking cop!

544
00:36:17,975 --> 00:36:22,878
Are you gonna stop doing coke deals
with your jerkoff fucking cousin?

545
00:36:23,047 --> 00:36:26,175
Yes. Yes, yes.

546
00:36:27,251 --> 00:36:29,378
All right, all right, all right.

547
00:36:29,553 --> 00:36:32,351
You're okay. You'll be all right.

548
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:35,757
Get your hand taken care of.

549
00:36:36,827 --> 00:36:41,389
I'm sorry, but it was necessary.

550
00:36:42,666 --> 00:36:46,295
As for our problem with Providence...

551
00:36:47,138 --> 00:36:49,936
...let's not cry over spilled guineas.

552
00:36:52,476 --> 00:36:55,445
Who let this IRA motherfucker in my bar?

553
00:37:01,252 --> 00:37:03,049
Just kidding. How's your mother?

554
00:37:03,988 --> 00:37:05,455
She's on her way out.

555
00:37:05,623 --> 00:37:08,683
We all are. Act accordingly.

556
00:37:08,993 --> 00:37:11,223
Here it is, Your Highness, as ordered.

557
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:13,556
Get in the car.
I wanna show you something.

558
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:16,825
- What's got you all hot and bothered?
- Get in the car. You'll see.

559
00:37:17,701 --> 00:37:20,329
Do you trust him?

560
00:37:20,971 --> 00:37:22,199
Well, these days...

561
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:24,498
...who's reliable?

562
00:37:25,042 --> 00:37:27,010
His Uncle Jackie was.

563
00:37:27,711 --> 00:37:32,171
Yeah, but you can't trust a guy
acts like he's got nothing to lose.

564
00:37:37,021 --> 00:37:38,818
I'm reliable.

565
00:37:39,623 --> 00:37:43,059
Arnold, you're one in a million.

566
00:37:43,227 --> 00:37:45,889
Ten. Ten million.

567
00:37:47,832 --> 00:37:50,528
What about your wife, Arnold?

568
00:37:53,037 --> 00:37:54,595
Well, I thought she was.

569
00:37:56,073 --> 00:37:57,870
She wasrt.

570
00:38:00,177 --> 00:38:02,042
Well, she got reliable.

571
00:38:04,148 --> 00:38:07,174
Don't you people ever shut the fuck up?

572
00:38:08,352 --> 00:38:10,377
Another county heard from.

573
00:38:10,554 --> 00:38:12,283
One too many. She got a big mouth.

574
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:14,549
Answer this for me, will you?

575
00:38:35,379 --> 00:38:38,940
The principles of detection tell me
these two gentlemen came from Providence.

576
00:38:39,116 --> 00:38:42,813
Lieutenant Risteen, Lynn PD. I'd
appreciate it you get out of my crime scene.

577
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:45,751
Yeah, actually, it's my crime scene,
but knock yourself out.

578
00:38:45,923 --> 00:38:47,390
Thanks.

579
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:53,888
I saw a dead guy. I think I'm having
posttraumatic stress.

580
00:38:54,064 --> 00:38:55,861
Can I meet you for lunch?

581
00:38:56,033 --> 00:38:57,295
All right, see you then.

582
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:03,502
Who's the lead detective?

583
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:06,507
Good. He's a lox.

584
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:18,748
Get the cops to look at Jimmy Pappas
for the hit. He had nothing to do with it...

585
00:39:18,923 --> 00:39:20,652
...and he'll say so.

586
00:39:20,824 --> 00:39:25,124
Look in his car, you'll find the gun
that did it, registered, official. Providence.

587
00:39:25,296 --> 00:39:27,491
In the trunk or the glove compartment?

588
00:39:28,799 --> 00:39:30,824
Hey, you wanna see some dead guys?

589
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:38,768
Hey, this will get Captain Ellerby
on the 6:00 news.

590
00:39:38,943 --> 00:39:40,240
No wonder you get ahead.

591
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:48,475
Have a seat, Bill.

592
00:39:56,193 --> 00:39:58,627
Do you know John Lennon?

593
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:02,790
Yeah, sure, he was the president
before Lincoln.

594
00:40:05,336 --> 00:40:07,463
Lennon said:

595
00:40:08,205 --> 00:40:09,900
"I'm an artist.

596
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:14,477
You give me a fucking tuba,
I'll get you something out of it."

597
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:20,080
I tell you, Mr. Costello...

598
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:23,515
...I'd like to squeeze
some fucking money out of it.

599
00:40:30,995 --> 00:40:33,293
Smart-mouth.

600
00:40:34,231 --> 00:40:36,131
Too bad.

601
00:40:37,334 --> 00:40:39,632
If you'll indulge me...

602
00:40:41,538 --> 00:40:42,527
Now what?

603
00:40:44,074 --> 00:40:46,008
Choir practice.

604
00:40:47,044 --> 00:40:48,375
Choir practice...

605
00:40:53,217 --> 00:40:55,651
The point I'm making
with John Lennon is...

606
00:40:56,787 --> 00:41:00,553
...a man could look at anything...

607
00:41:00,758 --> 00:41:02,385
...and make something out of it.

608
00:41:02,559 --> 00:41:04,026
For instance...

609
00:41:04,194 --> 00:41:06,594
...I look at you and I think:

610
00:41:07,531 --> 00:41:09,931
What could I use you for?

611
00:41:12,269 --> 00:41:13,930
Get rid of this.

612
00:41:14,104 --> 00:41:15,594
French.

613
00:41:15,773 --> 00:41:18,241
Put it downstairs. Here.
Go ahead, thank you.

614
00:41:18,409 --> 00:41:20,104
Maybe we could work something out.

615
00:41:20,944 --> 00:41:24,243
- Good.
- And send this to his wife.

616
00:41:24,415 --> 00:41:26,383
It was nice the way
you asked the guy...

617
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:28,780
...which hand he jerked off with.

618
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:30,887
I hope this don't shake Rita up.

619
00:41:32,289 --> 00:41:34,723
As I remember,
she ain't that sentimental.

620
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:45,597
That was quick.
You think he's dead already?

621
00:41:46,403 --> 00:41:48,462
We have to do it by phone.
I won't do it...

622
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:50,903
...if I have to wear a wire.
No wires. Understand?

623
00:41:51,075 --> 00:41:53,475
- You don't know what this is like.
- Microprocessors.

624
00:41:53,644 --> 00:41:55,942
- Micro what?
- Microprocessors.

625
00:41:56,113 --> 00:41:58,980
We'll probably be at war
with the Chinese in 20-odd years...

626
00:41:59,149 --> 00:42:02,084
...and Costello is selling them
military technology.

627
00:42:02,252 --> 00:42:04,652
Microprocessors, chips, computer parts.

628
00:42:04,822 --> 00:42:07,086
Anybody says anything about
anything like that...

629
00:42:07,257 --> 00:42:08,246
...you let us know.

630
00:42:12,229 --> 00:42:14,424
So who did the two guys
from Providence?

631
00:42:15,332 --> 00:42:17,095
Jimmy Pappas.

632
00:42:17,267 --> 00:42:19,258
What happened to Jimmy Pappas?

633
00:42:20,537 --> 00:42:22,732
Jimmy had a rough month.

634
00:42:22,973 --> 00:42:25,237
Jimmy had a heart attack in jail...

635
00:42:25,409 --> 00:42:28,606
...and then he got himself knifed
at Boston City Hospital.

636
00:42:28,779 --> 00:42:30,610
I believe it's been in the papers.

637
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:33,816
You seem quite happy with that result.

638
00:42:35,352 --> 00:42:36,979
It's a fucking result.

639
00:42:37,154 --> 00:42:40,419
Yeah, but cui bono? Who benefits?

640
00:42:40,591 --> 00:42:43,617
Cui gives a shit?
It's got a frigging bow on it.

641
00:42:46,029 --> 00:42:48,862
I think you are a cop, my son.

642
00:42:50,567 --> 00:42:52,194
- Where's your license?
- What license?

643
00:42:52,369 --> 00:42:55,304
I don't see none. There's no such thing
as a license, of course.

644
00:42:55,472 --> 00:42:58,600
But you, you definitely need
to have fucking one.

645
00:42:58,775 --> 00:43:02,176
If you're not being run by us,
you're being run by someone else.

646
00:43:02,346 --> 00:43:04,871
That means you're bringing
undesirable elements...

647
00:43:05,048 --> 00:43:06,982
...into Mr. Costello's area.

648
00:43:12,356 --> 00:43:14,916
I was going for my fucking cigarettes!

649
00:43:15,092 --> 00:43:16,116
Hey.

650
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:19,392
That's Jimmy Bags.

651
00:43:23,567 --> 00:43:26,297
- He was rea... I don't know.
- What the fuck you doing?

652
00:43:27,437 --> 00:43:29,098
I'm in the hole,
I pay him two grand.

653
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:31,070
There's no profit, I pay him two grand.

654
00:43:31,241 --> 00:43:33,141
Then make more money.
This is America.

655
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:36,609
You don't make money, you're
a douche bag. Now what you gonna do?

656
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:39,408
- Make more money.
- That's the spirit!

657
00:43:39,583 --> 00:43:41,676
- Oh, fuck.
- Don't worry about it.

658
00:43:41,852 --> 00:43:44,377
The guy don't need
any fucking teeth anyway.

659
00:43:44,588 --> 00:43:47,682
It's a small surveillance subunit,
but it's mine.

660
00:43:47,858 --> 00:43:50,725
I didn't take this job to fuck up
or let anyone else fuck up.

661
00:43:50,894 --> 00:43:55,126
I handpicked this group.
You're my A team. Now, our prim...

662
00:43:55,933 --> 00:43:57,025
Hi, Captain.

663
00:43:57,201 --> 00:43:58,395
This crazy fuck...

664
00:43:58,569 --> 00:44:00,696
...knocked Jimmy Bags' teeth out.
- So?

665
00:44:00,871 --> 00:44:02,964
- He was...
- He was reaching for his cigarettes.

666
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:05,973
You're gonna give me shit?
It wasrt for no reason, Frank.

667
00:44:06,143 --> 00:44:07,405
He reached into his coat.

668
00:44:07,578 --> 00:44:09,808
I don't know if he's a bookie
or what he's doing.

669
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:12,414
Well, you do know
what a bookie does, don't you?

670
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:14,642
Yeah. Yeah, he pays you.

671
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:17,082
Queenars compartmentalizing
everything in SIU...

672
00:44:17,254 --> 00:44:18,585
...which is the right thing.

673
00:44:18,755 --> 00:44:21,383
I don't trust half the troopers
out there anymore.

674
00:44:21,892 --> 00:44:23,792
Bottom line...

675
00:44:23,961 --> 00:44:26,054
...we think we might have a problem.

676
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:29,097
We think Costello's got a rat
in the state police.

677
00:44:30,767 --> 00:44:33,167
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

678
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:35,635
Do we have direct access
to Queenars undercovers?

679
00:44:35,806 --> 00:44:38,400
No, no, not presently.

680
00:44:38,575 --> 00:44:40,008
But I'm working on that.

681
00:44:40,177 --> 00:44:42,304
Here, Bill, this is for you.

682
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:46,609
From now on, call the bar,
ask for Mikey. Just Mikey.

683
00:44:46,783 --> 00:44:50,275
You ask for Mikey
because there is no Mikey.

684
00:44:50,554 --> 00:44:53,352
You wait. We'll call you.

685
00:44:53,523 --> 00:44:55,184
- You got that?
- Yeah, I got that.

686
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:58,294
- Sorry, I didn't hear you.
- I got that.

687
00:44:58,462 --> 00:45:00,089
Good.

688
00:45:01,598 --> 00:45:03,463
Hi, Dad.

689
00:45:04,167 --> 00:45:06,431
I got promoted. All right.

690
00:45:23,987 --> 00:45:25,955
Excuse me for one second.

691
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:28,854
You know...

692
00:45:30,127 --> 00:45:32,493
...if your father were alive...

693
00:45:32,663 --> 00:45:34,722
...and saw you here sitting with me...

694
00:45:34,898 --> 00:45:37,162
...let's say he'd have a word with me
about this.

695
00:45:37,334 --> 00:45:40,132
In fact, he'd kill seven guys
just to cut my throat.

696
00:45:40,304 --> 00:45:42,534
And he could do it...

697
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:47,008
...which is maybe something
you don't know about William Costigan Sr.

698
00:45:51,782 --> 00:45:56,378
- So he never...? I mean, never?
- No. No, no.

699
00:45:56,553 --> 00:46:00,045
He kept his own counsel.
He never wanted money.

700
00:46:00,223 --> 00:46:02,521
You can't do anything
with a man like that.

701
00:46:03,593 --> 00:46:05,220
Your Uncle Jackie...

702
00:46:05,395 --> 00:46:10,162
...he also would kill my entire fucking
family if he saw me here with you.

703
00:46:12,169 --> 00:46:14,763
And I think about this.

704
00:46:20,677 --> 00:46:23,373
So what the fuck
are we talking about here?

705
00:46:24,181 --> 00:46:27,082
Did you ever think about
going back to school?

706
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:29,275
School?

707
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:34,018
With all due respect, Mr. Costello...

708
00:46:34,191 --> 00:46:36,284
...school is out.

709
00:46:37,027 --> 00:46:39,791
Maybe someday
you'll wake the fuck up.

710
00:46:41,598 --> 00:46:42,860
Good day, Fathers.

711
00:46:44,067 --> 00:46:47,036
- Mr. Costello.
- Good morning, Francis, good morning.

712
00:46:47,204 --> 00:46:49,866
You recall our chat?

713
00:46:50,173 --> 00:46:52,266
Little boys...

714
00:46:52,709 --> 00:46:56,873
...sucking on their peckers,
et cetera and so forth...

715
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:59,881
"I am as God made me."
Was that your rationale?

716
00:47:01,952 --> 00:47:07,288
May I remind you, in this archdiocese,
God don't run the bingo.

717
00:47:07,457 --> 00:47:11,484
May I remind you
that pride comes before the fall.

718
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:16,966
How's Sister Mary Theresa doing?

719
00:47:17,134 --> 00:47:20,535
We had a tasty relationship
before she took her vows.

720
00:47:21,338 --> 00:47:23,499
Enjoy your clams, cocksuckers.

721
00:47:23,673 --> 00:47:25,368
Pay them.

722
00:47:26,643 --> 00:47:29,737
Get the old bombardier a drink
on the house.

723
00:47:36,553 --> 00:47:39,681
- What do you got for me?
- Uniform clipped him for suspended license.

724
00:47:39,856 --> 00:47:42,222
However, he's a subject of
an open investigation...

725
00:47:42,392 --> 00:47:44,326
More than one. He's one of Costello's.

726
00:47:44,494 --> 00:47:47,054
We're getting a warrant.
Can't get an address off him.

727
00:47:47,230 --> 00:47:49,892
He paged his lawyer but
the lawyer hasn't called back yet.

728
00:47:50,066 --> 00:47:52,694
- Who's the lawyer?
- Didrt know the name. Just a number.

729
00:47:53,437 --> 00:47:54,836
Beeper number.

730
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:57,837
- And the guy didn't show up?
- No.

731
00:47:58,909 --> 00:48:01,207
- And he beeped him?
- Twice.

732
00:48:05,449 --> 00:48:07,917
Give me your phone. Turn that off.

733
00:48:08,084 --> 00:48:10,211
- What?
- Turn the fucking camera off.

734
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:13,814
Give it to me. He doesn't know
what the fucking lawyer looks like.

735
00:48:13,990 --> 00:48:16,049
Whose briefcase is this? All right.

736
00:48:16,226 --> 00:48:17,488
- It's off?
- You're good.

737
00:48:17,661 --> 00:48:20,323
Afternoon, Mr. Fitzgibbons.

738
00:48:20,630 --> 00:48:22,825
- He can't do that.
- He just did.

739
00:48:22,999 --> 00:48:26,457
- You my attorney?
- What do you think?

740
00:48:27,637 --> 00:48:29,628
Have you made statements
or phone calls...

741
00:48:29,806 --> 00:48:31,467
...I need to be made aware of?

742
00:48:33,543 --> 00:48:36,171
I beeped you.

743
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:39,473
The card they gave me. That's it.

744
00:48:39,649 --> 00:48:43,050
- That's it?
- That's it.

745
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:47,689
You need to call your mother...

746
00:48:47,858 --> 00:48:50,156
...tell her you're not gonna be home
for supper.

747
00:48:54,865 --> 00:48:58,392
Camera's off.
It's off. Call your mother.

748
00:49:01,671 --> 00:49:05,004
Lookit, they're suiting up for a raid
right now.

749
00:49:05,242 --> 00:49:08,769
I don't know where they're going,
but they do. And so do you.

750
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:12,304
So make the call.

751
00:49:16,953 --> 00:49:20,411
Lookit, fuckstick,
you don't gotta trust me...

752
00:49:21,825 --> 00:49:24,487
...just listen to what I'm saying to you.

753
00:49:41,278 --> 00:49:45,772
Mom, I'm not gonna make it home
for supper.

754
00:49:45,949 --> 00:49:47,883
Sorry, yeah, I got held up.

755
00:49:49,419 --> 00:49:52,354
Yeah, no, you carry on without me.

756
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:56,621
I'll talk to you later. Okay.

757
00:49:56,793 --> 00:49:58,556
Bye.

758
00:49:58,762 --> 00:50:01,959
Everybody out. Move.

759
00:50:19,082 --> 00:50:20,310
Thank you.

760
00:50:21,618 --> 00:50:23,051
So who are you?

761
00:50:23,219 --> 00:50:26,655
I think you need a different attorney,
Mr. Fitzgibbons. Have a great day.

762
00:50:26,823 --> 00:50:28,484
So when the fuck am I gonna get out?

763
00:50:28,658 --> 00:50:31,991
All right, run the last number he called.
That's his house.

764
00:50:32,162 --> 00:50:34,858
I'll swear to the judge
I surveilled him there...

765
00:50:35,031 --> 00:50:37,124
...and abra-fucking-cadabra,
we got a warrant.

766
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:40,667
- Why did you use my phone?
- Because you didn't go in there.

767
00:50:51,781 --> 00:50:53,646
The light's nice here in the morning.

768
00:50:58,622 --> 00:51:01,250
So do you wanna talk about last night?

769
00:51:07,897 --> 00:51:11,424
You know, it's all right. Guys tend to make
too big a deal out of it.

770
00:51:17,007 --> 00:51:18,941
It's actually quite common.

771
00:51:19,109 --> 00:51:20,701
I gotta go to work.

772
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:31,750
Do you lie?

773
00:51:33,156 --> 00:51:35,647
Why? Do you?

774
00:51:35,825 --> 00:51:37,520
No, I'm asking if you lie.

775
00:51:38,595 --> 00:51:40,995
Honesty is not synonymous with truth.

776
00:51:41,164 --> 00:51:43,257
Yeah, you lie.

777
00:51:43,433 --> 00:51:44,593
You lie.

778
00:51:44,901 --> 00:51:47,426
Is it to do some good,
to get somewhere personally...

779
00:51:47,604 --> 00:51:49,663
...or, what, just for the fuck of it?

780
00:51:50,306 --> 00:51:55,266
Well, I expect that some people do it
to keep things on an even keel.

781
00:51:58,715 --> 00:52:00,706
So you had a parent who was a drunk.

782
00:52:04,587 --> 00:52:06,316
Did you?

783
00:52:06,489 --> 00:52:08,116
No.

784
00:52:10,427 --> 00:52:12,190
Let's keep it with you.

785
00:52:12,362 --> 00:52:14,956
Talk about how you feel.

786
00:52:16,766 --> 00:52:19,064
How I feel.

787
00:52:19,235 --> 00:52:21,135
How I feel.

788
00:52:41,991 --> 00:52:43,720
- Fuck.
- Brian, stop it.

789
00:52:48,998 --> 00:52:51,933
No. Please. No.

790
00:52:52,102 --> 00:52:53,899
Ain't gonna hurt you.

791
00:52:57,407 --> 00:52:58,738
You sit there...

792
00:52:58,908 --> 00:53:01,138
...with a mass murderer.

793
00:53:01,377 --> 00:53:03,106
A mass murderer.

794
00:53:03,279 --> 00:53:06,476
Your heart rate is jacked.

795
00:53:07,550 --> 00:53:09,279
And your hand...

796
00:53:10,954 --> 00:53:12,353
...steady.

797
00:53:14,758 --> 00:53:19,058
That's one thing I figured out about myself
in prison. My hand...

798
00:53:19,229 --> 00:53:21,424
...does not shake.

799
00:53:22,232 --> 00:53:23,722
Ever.

800
00:53:32,575 --> 00:53:34,702
Wake the fuck up.

801
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:39,171
There was a cop leaving when I came in.

802
00:53:39,582 --> 00:53:41,550
How did you know he was a cop?

803
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:46,519
Bad haircut, no dress sense and a slight,
you know, air of scumbag entitlement.

804
00:53:46,689 --> 00:53:48,850
- Do you see cops?
- That's part of what I do.

805
00:53:49,025 --> 00:53:52,222
I normally don't see cadets
who've been kicked out of the academy.

806
00:53:52,395 --> 00:53:55,626
Oh, boy.
You should get a better job, huh?

807
00:53:56,499 --> 00:53:58,160
Should I?

808
00:53:58,468 --> 00:54:01,801
So do they all come in here...

809
00:54:01,971 --> 00:54:04,201
...and cry, your cops?

810
00:54:04,707 --> 00:54:07,676
Sometimes they do. Yeah, sure.
Sometimes they cry, yeah.

811
00:54:07,844 --> 00:54:11,041
If they've had trouble at home,
if they've had to use their weapons...

812
00:54:11,214 --> 00:54:13,341
Use their weapons?

813
00:54:13,883 --> 00:54:15,350
Let me tell you something.

814
00:54:15,518 --> 00:54:17,816
They signed up to use their weapons.

815
00:54:17,987 --> 00:54:20,455
Most of them, all right.
But they watch enough TV...

816
00:54:20,623 --> 00:54:23,524
...so they know they have to weep
after they use their weapons.

817
00:54:23,693 --> 00:54:26,719
There is no one more full of shit
than a cop.

818
00:54:26,896 --> 00:54:28,693
Except for a cop on TV.

819
00:54:36,139 --> 00:54:38,039
I looked at your file.

820
00:54:39,676 --> 00:54:41,735
I see that you have a record of assault.

821
00:54:41,911 --> 00:54:43,435
Yeah.

822
00:54:43,713 --> 00:54:45,738
So what was it like for you in jail?

823
00:54:46,149 --> 00:54:50,381
What, you wanna hear about the showers?
Is that what you wanna hear about?

824
00:54:50,553 --> 00:54:52,384
Did something happen to you?

825
00:54:52,755 --> 00:54:54,188
No.

826
00:54:56,392 --> 00:55:00,852
- Okay, let's do this. Come on, spread them.
- Hey, you think you can pop somebody...

827
00:55:01,030 --> 00:55:04,431
...and there's a special card to play?
Jimmy Bags, whose jaw you broke...

828
00:55:04,601 --> 00:55:07,502
...happens to work undercover
for the Boston Police Department.

829
00:55:07,670 --> 00:55:10,036
I'm going nuts.
I can't be someone else every day.

830
00:55:10,206 --> 00:55:11,798
It's been a year. I've had enough!

831
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:15,103
Calm down. Most people do it every day.
What's the big deal?

832
00:55:15,278 --> 00:55:18,406
- Well, I'm not them. I'm not them, okay?
- Exactly.

833
00:55:18,581 --> 00:55:20,947
You're nobody.
You signed the papers, remember?

834
00:55:21,117 --> 00:55:24,678
We're the only two people on this earth
that even know you're a cop.

835
00:55:24,854 --> 00:55:26,879
How about we just erase your file, huh?

836
00:55:27,056 --> 00:55:28,819
How about we erase your file...

837
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:31,426
...and you're just
another soldier for Costello...

838
00:55:31,594 --> 00:55:34,825
...open to arrest for I don't know
how many felonies. What do you say?

839
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:38,593
How about I fucking kill you, huh?
How about I fucking kill you!

840
00:55:38,768 --> 00:55:40,895
- That was a joke. Come on.
- That wasrt a joke.

841
00:55:41,070 --> 00:55:43,300
You play a tough guy,
doesn't mean you are one...

842
00:55:43,473 --> 00:55:48,843
...you lace-curtain, Irish fucking pussy!
- Hey, hey! Stop it! Break it up! Stop it!

843
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:52,914
- Fuck you, motherfucker!
- Goddamn it, stop it! That's an order!

844
00:55:53,683 --> 00:55:55,776
For chrissake, be smart.

845
00:55:55,952 --> 00:55:59,251
If anybody's watching us now,
how are we not supposed to arrest you?

846
00:55:59,422 --> 00:56:00,980
Come on, get in the car.

847
00:56:01,157 --> 00:56:03,523
Both of you, get in the car.

848
00:56:05,795 --> 00:56:07,490
When are you gonna take Costello?

849
00:56:07,664 --> 00:56:09,791
What's wrong with taking him
on any one...

850
00:56:09,966 --> 00:56:13,265
...of the million felonies that
you've seen him do or I've seen him do?

851
00:56:13,436 --> 00:56:15,131
I mean, he murdered somebody, right?

852
00:56:15,305 --> 00:56:18,240
The guy fucking murders somebody
and you don't fucking take him!

853
00:56:18,408 --> 00:56:22,105
What are you waiting for? Do you want him
to chop me up and feed me to the poor?

854
00:56:22,278 --> 00:56:23,973
- That what you want?
- That'd stick.

855
00:56:24,147 --> 00:56:25,910
Will you shut up?

856
00:56:26,082 --> 00:56:28,448
We are building a case and it takes time.

857
00:56:28,618 --> 00:56:29,846
You know that.

858
00:56:31,154 --> 00:56:33,019
Something's wrong.

859
00:56:33,790 --> 00:56:35,621
I'm telling you, something's wrong.

860
00:56:37,627 --> 00:56:39,219
Yeah, maybe.

861
00:56:39,796 --> 00:56:42,526
Look, we need you to keep
your ears open, all right?

862
00:56:42,966 --> 00:56:44,695
No bullshit.

863
00:56:45,234 --> 00:56:48,397
I think Costello's got a spy inside
the Special Investigation Unit.

864
00:56:51,307 --> 00:56:52,831
You serious?

865
00:56:53,009 --> 00:56:54,806
I'm afraid so.

866
00:56:58,815 --> 00:57:01,375
Have you heard anything like that?

867
00:57:01,551 --> 00:57:03,212
Jesus Christ.

868
00:57:05,421 --> 00:57:07,252
Hang tight for me, kid.

869
00:57:07,423 --> 00:57:09,220
Just a little while longer.

870
00:57:09,392 --> 00:57:11,690
We are this close:

871
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:15,492
All right?

872
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:18,528
What do you expect coming in here?

873
00:57:18,701 --> 00:57:21,499
- I have to come here.
- I know you have to come here.

874
00:57:22,071 --> 00:57:24,596
But now that you're here...

875
00:57:24,874 --> 00:57:26,671
...what do you want?

876
00:57:27,076 --> 00:57:28,509
You want the truth?

877
00:57:30,813 --> 00:57:32,371
Valium.

878
00:57:32,715 --> 00:57:35,843
If you lied, you would have an easier time
getting what you wanted.

879
00:57:36,019 --> 00:57:39,420
- What's that say about what you do?
- We should have a few more meetings...

880
00:57:39,589 --> 00:57:43,286
...before we even talk about prescriptions.
- Look, I'm having panic attacks.

881
00:57:43,459 --> 00:57:47,793
Other night, I thought I was having a heart
attack. I puked in a barrel on the way over.

882
00:57:47,964 --> 00:57:49,556
I haven't slept for fucking weeks.

883
00:57:49,732 --> 00:57:51,256
- Is that true?
- Yeah, that's true.

884
00:57:51,434 --> 00:57:54,130
I said something fucking true.
I want some fucking pills...

885
00:57:54,303 --> 00:57:56,134
...and you're gonna close my file?

886
00:57:56,305 --> 00:57:59,934
- I didn't say I'd close your file. No, l...
- I thought I was supposed to tell...

887
00:58:00,109 --> 00:58:02,703
...the truth here, if only fucking here.
- You are! Yes.

888
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:07,009
A guy comes in here against every instinct
of privacy, of self-reliance that he has...

889
00:58:07,183 --> 00:58:08,172
...and what do you do?

890
00:58:08,351 --> 00:58:12,412
What do you do? You send him off on the
street to score smack? Is that what you do?

891
00:58:12,955 --> 00:58:15,321
You're fucking ridiculous.

892
00:58:23,099 --> 00:58:24,896
Two pills?

893
00:58:25,768 --> 00:58:27,929
Why don't you just give me
a bottle of Scotch...

894
00:58:28,104 --> 00:58:30,265
...and a handgun
to blow my fucking head off?

895
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:33,432
- Are we done with this psychiatry bullshit?
- You can leave!

896
00:58:33,609 --> 00:58:36,009
What did I just put myself through?
I'm out of here.

897
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:40,616
And what if that was a legitimate threat?
Think about it, fucking hotshot.

898
00:58:41,984 --> 00:58:43,611
Fuck.

899
00:58:52,328 --> 00:58:54,990
Why is the last patient of the day
always the hardest one?

900
00:58:55,164 --> 00:58:56,961
You're tired and you don't give a shit.

901
00:58:57,133 --> 00:58:59,033
- It's not supernatural.
- Listen.

902
00:58:59,202 --> 00:59:04,299
Listen. You know, I'm not just somebody
that you have to see or they put you in jail.

903
00:59:04,474 --> 00:59:07,341
Okay? I mean, if you're in distress,
I will help you.

904
00:59:09,378 --> 00:59:10,936
What's this?

905
00:59:11,414 --> 00:59:14,247
It's my card. And a prescription
for 20 lorazepam.

906
00:59:14,417 --> 00:59:15,975
Yeah?

907
00:59:16,152 --> 00:59:17,779
Is it enough to commit suicide?

908
00:59:18,354 --> 00:59:20,845
Maybe it is. All right? Okay?

909
00:59:21,023 --> 00:59:23,184
Have I done my job
up to your goddamn standards?

910
00:59:23,359 --> 00:59:27,090
Because according to my standards,
you fit the model of drug-seeking behavior.

911
00:59:27,263 --> 00:59:30,892
You know, and too damn bad
if you don't like my initial clinical reaction.

912
00:59:31,067 --> 00:59:32,329
Thank you.

913
00:59:33,569 --> 00:59:36,129
I'm transferring you to another counselor.

914
00:59:36,305 --> 00:59:38,296
- Good.
- Okay.

915
00:59:39,942 --> 00:59:42,035
So you wanna get a cup of coffee?

916
00:59:48,885 --> 00:59:51,752
Bring it in here, please.
Would somebody bring it in?

917
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:53,286
Come on in.

918
00:59:54,390 --> 00:59:58,383
Our target is a major transaction
of microprocessors.

919
00:59:58,561 --> 01:00:00,153
Yes, those.

920
01:00:00,329 --> 01:00:04,060
I don't know what they are, you don't know
what they are. Who gives a fuck. Cash.

921
01:00:04,233 --> 01:00:06,758
Lots of cash is gonna change hands
inside a building...

922
01:00:06,936 --> 01:00:09,200
...that we have
under AV surveillance close-by.

923
01:00:09,405 --> 01:00:12,966
I know this location is not the best,
but we had very little time to set up.

924
01:00:13,142 --> 01:00:15,007
- You guys know anything about this?
- No.

925
01:00:15,178 --> 01:00:18,238
Sullivars team will ID the bad guys
and listen in on the phones.

926
01:00:18,414 --> 01:00:19,779
Our unit will not take action.

927
01:00:20,416 --> 01:00:24,284
I repeat, not take action, until a man
that Captain Queenan has inside...

928
01:00:24,453 --> 01:00:26,648
...verifies the transaction. Are we clear?

929
01:00:26,822 --> 01:00:30,781
Anybody? Any questions? No?
This is who we're after.

930
01:00:31,627 --> 01:00:34,562
We've been after this cocksucker
for a long time, and tonight...

931
01:00:34,730 --> 01:00:37,255
...we are going to get him.
Let's go to work.

932
01:00:37,433 --> 01:00:40,197
All right, you guys find out
what we're doing and get on it.

933
01:00:40,369 --> 01:00:42,701
Sorry to get you last-minute,
but things leak.

934
01:00:42,872 --> 01:00:44,897
This lead came from
Queenars undercover guy.

935
01:00:45,074 --> 01:00:49,636
I'm gonna smoke. You don't smoke? One of
those fitness freaks, huh? Go fuck yourself.

936
01:00:54,750 --> 01:00:56,877
- Hi, Dad?
- Yes.

937
01:00:57,053 --> 01:00:59,214
Yeah, something big came up at work.

938
01:00:59,388 --> 01:01:01,879
- I'm not gonna be home for supper.
- Too bad.

939
01:01:02,725 --> 01:01:04,625
Your mother worked all goddamn day.

940
01:01:04,927 --> 01:01:08,294
We'll just have to sit down without you
and your friends.

941
01:01:08,464 --> 01:01:10,625
Oh, no, my friends are still coming.

942
01:01:14,103 --> 01:01:16,936
So we'll just... I'll just see you
for lunch instead tomorrow.

943
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:19,603
Your mother will be proud.

944
01:01:19,775 --> 01:01:21,640
All right, thanks, Pop. Bye.

945
01:01:21,944 --> 01:01:24,435
The readiness is all.

946
01:01:25,214 --> 01:01:29,082
You know the players. Call the game.

947
01:01:30,853 --> 01:01:32,013
Thank you.

948
01:01:33,256 --> 01:01:35,190
- You ready?
- Is your highness...

949
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:38,521
...gonna drop me off at confession
before work, or fuck me, or what?

950
01:01:38,694 --> 01:01:41,424
What have you got to confess
to that anointed pederast?

951
01:01:41,597 --> 01:01:44,532
A confessional seal, these days...

952
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:46,327
...I'm not so sure.

953
01:01:51,307 --> 01:01:54,037
He'll operate the cameras.
You ID the guys and log them.

954
01:01:54,477 --> 01:01:56,707
All cell-phone signals
are under surveillance...

955
01:01:56,879 --> 01:01:59,643
...through the courtesy of
our federal friends over there.

956
01:02:02,151 --> 01:02:05,951
Patriot Act, Patriot Act.
I love it, I love it, I love it.

957
01:02:09,158 --> 01:02:10,318
Keep an eye on this one.

958
01:02:45,528 --> 01:02:47,758
All right, here we go.

959
01:02:50,433 --> 01:02:52,731
There's Costello. Mr. French.

960
01:02:53,002 --> 01:02:54,731
There's Fitzy, Delahunt...

961
01:02:55,104 --> 01:02:56,935
...and the new guy, Billy Costigan.

962
01:03:03,512 --> 01:03:05,980
Time is 10:46.

963
01:03:08,050 --> 01:03:10,109
All right, turn off your cell phones.

964
01:03:10,286 --> 01:03:13,278
Fitzy's got the chicken.
Check your weapons.

965
01:03:36,045 --> 01:03:39,071
- We have a blind spot.
- Why do we have a blind spot?

966
01:03:39,248 --> 01:03:41,148
We had two hours' notice. Two hours.

967
01:03:41,317 --> 01:03:44,047
- Fuck you think this is, NASA?
- It never crossed my mind.

968
01:03:44,220 --> 01:03:47,280
- Have you got a camera in the back?
- What back?

969
01:03:54,029 --> 01:03:56,657
- How you going, Robert?
- Good, Mr. Costello.

970
01:03:57,066 --> 01:04:00,695
I wanna tell you, at least two
of these gents have machine guns.

971
01:04:14,417 --> 01:04:16,942
He's from the Chinese government.
He's scared shitless.

972
01:04:17,386 --> 01:04:20,253
Government man. Scared.

973
01:04:20,656 --> 01:04:24,353
I'm concerned about a Chinaman
who thinks it's wise...

974
01:04:24,527 --> 01:04:27,928
...to come to a business transaction...

975
01:04:28,230 --> 01:04:29,993
...with automatic weapons.

976
01:04:36,839 --> 01:04:39,808
For his own good, tell Bruce Lee
and the Karate Kids...

977
01:04:39,975 --> 01:04:42,603
...none of us are carrying
automatic weapons.

978
01:04:42,778 --> 01:04:46,077
Because here, in this country...

979
01:04:46,515 --> 01:04:49,040
...it don't add inches to your dick.

980
01:04:49,218 --> 01:04:51,413
You get a life sentence for it.

981
01:05:07,470 --> 01:05:12,339
If we had some Homeland Security money
like some douche bags I could mention...

982
01:05:12,508 --> 01:05:14,669
- Any calls?
- They turned off their cell phones.

983
01:05:15,177 --> 01:05:17,372
Search randomly for calls
made from the area.

984
01:05:17,546 --> 01:05:19,946
Eight hundred and seven phones
are live in this area.

985
01:05:20,115 --> 01:05:21,582
Then narrow the area.

986
01:05:21,750 --> 01:05:24,310
What you see there for service
is what you're gonna get.

987
01:05:24,487 --> 01:05:26,387
Why did they turn their phones off?

988
01:05:26,555 --> 01:05:29,524
- Wait. There's still one phone up.
- Where?

989
01:05:41,704 --> 01:05:43,569
The buyers are there.

990
01:05:47,243 --> 01:05:50,610
You know, direct contact with your guys
would have its advantages.

991
01:05:50,779 --> 01:05:52,269
Not to my guy.

992
01:05:52,815 --> 01:05:55,545
This is unbelievable.
Who put the cameras in this place?

993
01:05:55,918 --> 01:05:57,180
Oh, who the fuck are you?

994
01:05:57,720 --> 01:06:00,848
I'm the guy who does his job.
You must be the other guy.

995
01:06:03,993 --> 01:06:07,326
If these Chinks wanna nuke Taiwan
any time in this century...

996
01:06:07,496 --> 01:06:11,762
...they'd better shape up
and show me 1 million dollars.

997
01:06:16,906 --> 01:06:20,342
What we generally do, in this country...

998
01:06:20,910 --> 01:06:22,639
...is one guy...

999
01:06:22,945 --> 01:06:25,004
...brings the items...

1000
01:06:25,180 --> 01:06:27,478
...and the other guy...

1001
01:06:27,783 --> 01:06:29,080
...pays him.

1002
01:06:32,821 --> 01:06:34,880
No "tickee"...

1003
01:06:35,491 --> 01:06:37,721
...no laundry.

1004
01:06:46,168 --> 01:06:48,261
Go ahead, Fitz.

1005
01:07:04,386 --> 01:07:07,378
Cars are moving,
but did you see anybody come out?

1006
01:07:09,091 --> 01:07:11,150
Please tell me those cars aren't empty.

1007
01:07:11,327 --> 01:07:16,390
I mean, Jesus fucking Christ, please tell me
that those Chinamers cars aren't empty!

1008
01:07:20,970 --> 01:07:23,905
They didn't figure we had a navy.

1009
01:07:29,745 --> 01:07:31,975
Did you put a camera in the back?

1010
01:07:33,682 --> 01:07:35,912
Can I talk to you for a second, please?

1011
01:07:38,253 --> 01:07:40,483
You stupid fucking hard-on!

1012
01:07:41,323 --> 01:07:42,847
You fucked this whole thing up!

1013
01:07:43,025 --> 01:07:46,290
What the fuck did you do,
you cocksucker? Let go of me!

1014
01:07:46,462 --> 01:07:49,727
I'm gonna rip your fucking arm off
and shove it up your fucking ass!

1015
01:07:50,065 --> 01:07:52,260
Why don't we meet?
Let me buy you an ice cream.

1016
01:07:52,434 --> 01:07:54,664
I'm getting on a plane
unless you put Queenan on.

1017
01:07:54,837 --> 01:07:57,829
Queenan had a funeral to go to.
This is my shift. Calm down.

1018
01:07:58,007 --> 01:08:00,032
Why shouldn't I get
on a fucking plane, huh?

1019
01:08:00,209 --> 01:08:02,837
Meet up? You actually want me dead?

1020
01:08:03,012 --> 01:08:05,845
Look, there is a rat in your unit.
That is a fact, all right?

1021
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:07,482
- Where's Queenan?
- He's not here.

1022
01:08:07,650 --> 01:08:10,710
They knew you had cameras in the building.
They knew everything.

1023
01:08:10,886 --> 01:08:14,049
There is a leak from the inside.
It's real. Man, smoke him out.

1024
01:08:14,223 --> 01:08:18,250
Yeah, how do we do that, Mr. Genius-Who-
Didrt-Even-Graduate-From-the-Academy?

1025
01:08:18,427 --> 01:08:21,954
Disinform. Let it slip to SIU that you have
a sealed wiretap warrant...

1026
01:08:22,131 --> 01:08:26,591
...for Costello's apartment. Don't tell
anyone in our division, but tell SIU.

1027
01:08:26,769 --> 01:08:29,237
Flush it down the pipe,
see if it comes out on my end.

1028
01:08:29,405 --> 01:08:31,270
That's what we do first. Narrow it down.

1029
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:34,500
- Where the fuck is Queenan, huh?
- He's not here.

1030
01:08:34,677 --> 01:08:37,771
You wanna meet up
or you got something real, call me back.

1031
01:08:43,786 --> 01:08:46,949
- Changing your life radically.

1032
01:08:47,122 --> 01:08:49,522
Change anything. Right?
Change everything.

1033
01:08:49,692 --> 01:08:51,717
- Right?
- Yeah.

1034
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:56,996
How long you been with this guy?

1035
01:08:57,833 --> 01:09:00,461
- My boyfriend?
- Yeah.

1036
01:09:03,172 --> 01:09:06,369
- Four months. Almost four months.
- Four months.

1037
01:09:06,542 --> 01:09:08,066
Do you love him?

1038
01:09:10,245 --> 01:09:12,713
It's a pretty serious relationship, yeah.

1039
01:09:12,881 --> 01:09:14,246
It's very serious.

1040
01:09:14,416 --> 01:09:18,113
Is he a headcase like me?
I'm just curious.

1041
01:09:18,721 --> 01:09:20,746
No more than I am.

1042
01:09:21,390 --> 01:09:23,381
I know that it's a serious relationship.

1043
01:09:24,026 --> 01:09:26,256
I know there are ups and downs. Right?

1044
01:09:26,428 --> 01:09:28,760
People have doubts and problems.

1045
01:09:29,231 --> 01:09:32,894
Well, not problems, but doubts.

1046
01:09:35,637 --> 01:09:39,403
What would you do if he was standing
right there and he saw us?

1047
01:09:44,413 --> 01:09:47,780
I would lie. Yeah, I would lie.

1048
01:09:47,950 --> 01:09:51,477
You know, to keep things
on an even keel, right?

1049
01:09:51,653 --> 01:09:53,746
Right? We talked about that.

1050
01:09:59,294 --> 01:10:01,262
- Morning.
- Good morning.

1051
01:10:01,830 --> 01:10:03,855
Want a French doughnut?

1052
01:10:04,366 --> 01:10:05,833
Yeah.

1053
01:10:07,269 --> 01:10:08,861
- Hey, can I lookit?
- Yeah.

1054
01:10:09,271 --> 01:10:10,499
Sure.

1055
01:10:13,142 --> 01:10:15,770
- All right, we're not having this out.
- What?

1056
01:10:15,944 --> 01:10:18,105
You don't see any pictures
of where I came from.

1057
01:10:18,580 --> 01:10:20,047
Look, I respect who you are...

1058
01:10:20,215 --> 01:10:22,376
...just, you know, not in the living room.

1059
01:10:22,551 --> 01:10:24,143
We might have company.

1060
01:10:24,319 --> 01:10:26,310
- Company?
- Yeah, company.

1061
01:10:27,055 --> 01:10:30,456
- Hey, now, why do you work for the state?
- Why not? You do.

1062
01:10:30,626 --> 01:10:34,323
No, what you do. The degrees and all,
everything you got. You're hot shit.

1063
01:10:34,696 --> 01:10:35,685
Yeah?

1064
01:10:35,702 --> 01:10:38,637
So why do you make as much
as a guidance counselor?

1065
01:10:38,805 --> 01:10:42,332
Because I believe in public service.

1066
01:10:44,111 --> 01:10:47,478
So now you're gonna fuck with me?
So now you're gonna be ridiculous, huh?

1067
01:10:48,248 --> 01:10:50,716
- No, don't start with me. Don't...
- Hey.

1068
01:10:51,451 --> 01:10:54,011
Ah, fuck with the fucking phone! Stop it!

1069
01:10:54,187 --> 01:10:55,882
- The phone.
- Forget the phone.

1070
01:10:56,056 --> 01:10:57,523
Get it. Answer it. Answer it.

1071
01:10:57,791 --> 01:10:59,918
This is your first phone call
in the new house.

1072
01:11:00,093 --> 01:11:02,288
You live here now. You're a resident.

1073
01:11:04,264 --> 01:11:05,993
Mayor Sullivars office.

1074
01:11:06,166 --> 01:11:08,964
Put Colin on the phone right now.

1075
01:11:09,436 --> 01:11:10,733
Oh, my God. I'm sorry.

1076
01:11:10,904 --> 01:11:12,428
What?

1077
01:11:12,906 --> 01:11:15,033
I think it's a guy with...

1078
01:11:15,208 --> 01:11:19,201
- It's like a cancer guy.
- Hello.

1079
01:11:19,379 --> 01:11:22,542
What the fuck is it
with you and your phone, huh?

1080
01:11:24,384 --> 01:11:25,749
Something for work.

1081
01:11:25,919 --> 01:11:29,787
Hey. Nothing, nothing, nothing.
It went dead. I don't know, I get...

1082
01:11:29,990 --> 01:11:32,254
Was that that shrink cunt
that answered the phone?

1083
01:11:32,426 --> 01:11:35,054
Remember I told you that we were...
She was gonna move in?

1084
01:11:35,228 --> 01:11:36,923
- Yeah.
- She moved in.

1085
01:11:37,097 --> 01:11:40,828
- You better get organized, quick.
- Hey, last time I checked, I tipped you off...

1086
01:11:41,001 --> 01:11:42,832
...and you're not in jail.

1087
01:11:43,003 --> 01:11:46,404
- Are you listening to me?
- Yeah.

1088
01:11:46,573 --> 01:11:50,304
Do you like Little Miss Thing
sucking on your cock?

1089
01:11:53,013 --> 01:11:54,378
Yes. Yes, I do.

1090
01:11:54,548 --> 01:11:56,175
So earn it.

1091
01:11:57,050 --> 01:11:59,109
I'm getting the feeling...

1092
01:11:59,286 --> 01:12:01,186
...we got a cop in my crew.

1093
01:12:01,488 --> 01:12:03,888
Yeah, I know,
I'm kind of getting that feeling too.

1094
01:12:04,057 --> 01:12:06,855
He's one of yours. Inside.

1095
01:12:07,027 --> 01:12:08,119
Have you seen anything?

1096
01:12:08,295 --> 01:12:11,890
I got no access to Queenars undercover
files. He and Dignam run the snitches.

1097
01:12:12,065 --> 01:12:13,259
- Doing my best.
- Your best?

1098
01:12:13,433 --> 01:12:16,300
What do you think we're in,
the fucking haberdashery business?

1099
01:12:16,470 --> 01:12:18,028
Look, Frank, if you don't relax...

1100
01:12:18,205 --> 01:12:22,073
If you don't relax, I can't relax. All right?
Now, what I need you to do...

1101
01:12:22,242 --> 01:12:25,700
...get me information on the people
with you last night. Your crew.

1102
01:12:25,879 --> 01:12:27,813
Get me social-security numbers, get me...

1103
01:12:27,981 --> 01:12:32,145
Get you? Give you?
Who the fuck do you work for?

1104
01:12:32,319 --> 01:12:35,584
All right, all right. Frank, Frank, Frank.
All right. I'm sorry.

1105
01:12:35,756 --> 01:12:38,953
If you could, please.
What I need are SS numbers, DOBs...

1106
01:12:39,126 --> 01:12:43,654
...just all the pedigree information so I can
run it on my end and we can ID the prick.

1107
01:12:43,830 --> 01:12:45,627
If you can get me that information...

1108
01:12:45,799 --> 01:12:48,233
...I can... We're gonna handle it.
I can handle it.

1109
01:12:48,401 --> 01:12:50,596
Calm down, or you'll shoot in your pants.

1110
01:12:50,771 --> 01:12:52,500
I'll get you the records and whatnot.

1111
01:12:52,672 --> 01:12:55,835
But listen to me, son.
Don't disappoint me on this...

1112
01:12:56,009 --> 01:12:59,308
...or some other guy will be putting
their fat cock...

1113
01:12:59,479 --> 01:13:01,970
...up Little Miss Freud's ass.

1114
01:13:08,789 --> 01:13:11,155
How are you, Francis?

1115
01:13:16,329 --> 01:13:19,821
- My mother called me Francis.
- I know she did.

1116
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,798
And your father called you the tumor.

1117
01:13:22,969 --> 01:13:25,631
And what did your father
call you, Charlie?

1118
01:13:25,806 --> 01:13:29,799
Oh, yeah, I forgot. He wasrt around.

1119
01:13:29,976 --> 01:13:32,103
You have a boss
that has a laryngectomy?

1120
01:13:32,279 --> 01:13:36,181
No, no, no. That was a guy
who works for me.

1121
01:13:36,349 --> 01:13:38,340
You're lying to me.

1122
01:13:40,120 --> 01:13:41,485
Not exactly.

1123
01:13:41,655 --> 01:13:45,113
What did you do with
the real microprocessors, Frank?

1124
01:13:45,559 --> 01:13:48,255
Microprocessors.

1125
01:13:48,762 --> 01:13:49,990
Oh, yeah.

1126
01:13:50,163 --> 01:13:53,326
I heard the story. You arrested
some Chinese government guys...

1127
01:13:53,500 --> 01:13:56,833
...at the border carrying some light sockets
or something.

1128
01:13:58,538 --> 01:14:01,371
I can't wait to wipe that fucking smirk
off of your face.

1129
01:14:02,042 --> 01:14:04,704
Wouldrt you rather wipe my ass for me?

1130
01:14:04,878 --> 01:14:08,837
There are certain parts of my job that
I'm not gonna be able to talk to you about.

1131
01:14:09,216 --> 01:14:13,983
And I cannot allow you to jeopardize
an ongoing investigation...

1132
01:14:14,154 --> 01:14:16,179
...or your life.

1133
01:14:17,157 --> 01:14:20,149
No, really, there are things
you don't even wanna know about.

1134
01:14:20,794 --> 01:14:22,523
Okay, then just say that.

1135
01:14:24,611 --> 01:14:25,976
All right, I will.

1136
01:14:26,613 --> 01:14:28,774
Oh, that's the movers.

1137
01:14:28,949 --> 01:14:30,712
Yeah, you still wanna stay?

1138
01:14:31,685 --> 01:14:33,846
- Yes.
- Yeah?

1139
01:14:34,021 --> 01:14:37,650
Come on, I'm coming!
It's the worst timing.

1140
01:14:38,092 --> 01:14:40,060
I'm gonna get you.

1141
01:14:41,261 --> 01:14:44,094
If you could've, you would've.

1142
01:14:44,365 --> 01:14:47,926
But I guess you like to go
at your own pace.

1143
01:14:48,102 --> 01:14:52,471
Excuse me. Got a date with some angels.

1144
01:15:00,514 --> 01:15:01,503
Frankie.

1145
01:15:02,449 --> 01:15:03,916
Frankie!

1146
01:15:04,785 --> 01:15:06,878
Your mother forgives me.

1147
01:15:11,658 --> 01:15:13,523
You take off an armored car at the mall.

1148
01:15:13,694 --> 01:15:15,719
What the fuck,
you pay guineas in Providence?

1149
01:15:15,896 --> 01:15:18,729
- Fucking now I do!
- What the fuck do you do?

1150
01:15:18,899 --> 01:15:23,302
I gotta pay Costello for him to trade me
to the FBI? Because that's what he does.

1151
01:15:23,470 --> 01:15:25,961
FBI? What the fuck
you talking about, FBI?

1152
01:15:29,410 --> 01:15:30,934
My God, is that French out there?

1153
01:15:31,111 --> 01:15:33,272
What the fuck did you just say
about the FBI?

1154
01:15:33,447 --> 01:15:35,381
Forget what I said. I'm fucking high.

1155
01:15:36,049 --> 01:15:38,540
Whatever may be going on
in that very fucking poor...

1156
01:15:38,719 --> 01:15:42,485
...very limited brain of yours,
I am not gonna hurt you, all right?

1157
01:15:42,756 --> 01:15:44,917
- Just tell me what you fucking said.
- Forget it.

1158
01:15:45,092 --> 01:15:48,994
I'm high. I'm fucking high. I must be high.
I'd never say what you thought I said.

1159
01:15:49,830 --> 01:15:50,819
Fuck!

1160
01:15:50,998 --> 01:15:54,297
Now, what the fuck
did you just fucking say?

1161
01:15:54,468 --> 01:15:58,427
Why do you think he never gets busted?
Costello's a protected FBI informant.

1162
01:15:58,605 --> 01:16:01,096
He'll trade you out.

1163
01:16:01,475 --> 01:16:04,171
I thought
I was supposed to go into shock.

1164
01:16:04,344 --> 01:16:07,438
I'm not in shock. It fucking hurts!

1165
01:16:07,614 --> 01:16:10,606
It fucking hurts!

1166
01:16:18,125 --> 01:16:20,355
Hey. It's me.

1167
01:16:20,527 --> 01:16:22,859
- What are you doing here?
- Come here.

1168
01:16:25,065 --> 01:16:27,829
Costello's giving people up to the FBI.

1169
01:16:28,001 --> 01:16:32,301
- The FBI?
- He is giving information to the FBI.

1170
01:16:32,473 --> 01:16:34,839
He's a protected fucking informant.

1171
01:16:35,008 --> 01:16:39,240
I mean, aren't they always trying to make it
a federal case and it never gets made?

1172
01:16:40,414 --> 01:16:43,042
Go around the back.
I'll open the door. Go on.

1173
01:16:46,753 --> 01:16:50,120
- Here's some ice water.
- Oh, thanks. Thanks.

1174
01:16:55,195 --> 01:16:56,890
That's my son, Patrick.

1175
01:16:57,197 --> 01:17:00,325
- Goes to Notre Dame.
- Oh, yeah?

1176
01:17:00,501 --> 01:17:03,868
My wife's asleep but she left some
supper out. You want something to eat?

1177
01:17:04,037 --> 01:17:05,527
No. No, thanks.

1178
01:17:05,706 --> 01:17:09,301
Yeah, come on, man. You have
some supper. We'll talk in the kitchen.

1179
01:17:09,476 --> 01:17:11,103
Come on.

1180
01:17:46,647 --> 01:17:47,875
You want some coke?

1181
01:17:53,420 --> 01:17:55,320
There it is.

1182
01:17:55,956 --> 01:17:58,447
Don't move till you're numb.

1183
01:18:13,473 --> 01:18:15,407
Come on. Get inside.

1184
01:18:17,744 --> 01:18:19,575
Boss wants your real name...

1185
01:18:20,280 --> 01:18:23,272
...your social and license number,
your bank account numbers.

1186
01:18:23,450 --> 01:18:25,543
I don't have a bank account.

1187
01:18:25,719 --> 01:18:28,916
- I'm a cash business myself.
- What's he doing, setting up IRAs?

1188
01:18:29,089 --> 01:18:33,025
Just fill the fucking paper in. Your real name
and all your account numbers.

1189
01:18:33,193 --> 01:18:35,024
Then we wait here.

1190
01:18:35,862 --> 01:18:38,592
- You're shitting me.
- No, I ain't.

1191
01:18:49,977 --> 01:18:52,104
Put the forms in there.

1192
01:18:55,616 --> 01:18:57,982
I don't know if this
is how you spell "citizens."

1193
01:18:58,151 --> 01:19:00,813
But fuck it, you know?

1194
01:19:01,321 --> 01:19:03,789
No, no, no. Come here.

1195
01:19:08,762 --> 01:19:10,753
What, are you fucking retarded
or something?

1196
01:19:10,931 --> 01:19:13,092
That ain't fucking right.

1197
01:19:13,266 --> 01:19:14,528
Are you kidding me?

1198
01:19:14,701 --> 01:19:15,998
Look at this. Look.

1199
01:19:16,770 --> 01:19:18,761
"Citizens." Look.

1200
01:19:19,106 --> 01:19:20,437
Billy, he said to stay here.

1201
01:19:20,807 --> 01:19:23,332
Yeah. I'm not sitting here
without a tetanus shot.

1202
01:19:23,510 --> 01:19:24,875
Where the fuck are you going?

1203
01:19:25,045 --> 01:19:29,209
I'm not staying, all right?
You can tell him I said that.

1204
01:19:48,535 --> 01:19:50,560
- Hey.
- Hi.

1205
01:19:52,606 --> 01:19:54,665
- It's pouring out there.
- Yeah.

1206
01:20:01,581 --> 01:20:03,446
Look...

1207
01:20:03,617 --> 01:20:05,380
...if this is inappropriate, l...
- No.

1208
01:20:05,552 --> 01:20:08,180
No, it's not inappropriate.
You're not a patient.

1209
01:20:11,024 --> 01:20:12,992
So you moving out or you moving in?

1210
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:15,921
I've still got
three weeks left on the lease.

1211
01:20:25,105 --> 01:20:26,766
That's me.

1212
01:20:29,843 --> 01:20:31,333
Yeah, I know.

1213
01:20:37,417 --> 01:20:41,114
- Hedging your bets?
- No. No.

1214
01:20:41,488 --> 01:20:42,887
You have to choose.

1215
01:20:43,056 --> 01:20:45,718
- You have to make a...
- A decision.

1216
01:20:45,892 --> 01:20:49,293
A decision. And, you know, you have to
stick by what you choose.

1217
01:20:49,463 --> 01:20:51,727
- You have to...
- Move in with your boyfriend?

1218
01:20:51,898 --> 01:20:54,492
Yes. Otherwise it's...

1219
01:20:55,435 --> 01:20:58,336
Oh, I know, I know. I know.

1220
01:21:09,149 --> 01:21:14,382
I have to say your vulnerability
is really freaking me out right now.

1221
01:21:19,593 --> 01:21:21,254
Is it real?

1222
01:21:25,165 --> 01:21:26,894
I think so.

1223
01:21:32,806 --> 01:21:34,671
You don't have any cats.

1224
01:21:34,841 --> 01:21:36,399
No.

1225
01:21:37,377 --> 01:21:39,140
I like that.

1226
01:22:51,451 --> 01:22:52,645
I don't get it.

1227
01:22:55,555 --> 01:22:58,183
We are all convinced
that Costello has at least...

1228
01:22:58,358 --> 01:23:01,521
...one mole inside
the Special Investigations Unit.

1229
01:23:01,695 --> 01:23:05,927
You will investigate everybody
and anybody.

1230
01:23:06,099 --> 01:23:10,263
Well, that's not exactly
a dream job for a cop.

1231
01:23:10,437 --> 01:23:13,702
We looked at all possible candidates.
You have an immaculate record.

1232
01:23:13,874 --> 01:23:17,207
Some people don't trust a guy
with an immaculate record. I do.

1233
01:23:17,377 --> 01:23:18,844
I have an immaculate record.

1234
01:23:20,113 --> 01:23:21,978
How is your wedding coming along?

1235
01:23:22,148 --> 01:23:24,582
Great. Great. She's a doctor.

1236
01:23:25,118 --> 01:23:27,518
- That's outstanding.
- Yeah.

1237
01:23:27,687 --> 01:23:29,814
Marriage is an important part
of getting ahead.

1238
01:23:29,990 --> 01:23:32,891
Lets people know you're not a homo.
Married guy is more stable.

1239
01:23:33,059 --> 01:23:35,721
People see the ring, think at least
someone can stand him.

1240
01:23:35,896 --> 01:23:39,957
Ladies see the ring, they know you must
have some cash and your cock must work.

1241
01:23:40,767 --> 01:23:43,201
Yeah, it's working. Overtime.

1242
01:23:43,637 --> 01:23:46,367
- I'm glad to hear that.
- Thank you.

1243
01:24:34,454 --> 01:24:38,117
Be dirty, be dirty.

1244
01:24:40,293 --> 01:24:42,488
Yeah...

1245
01:24:47,701 --> 01:24:50,431
Frank. The fuck is wrong with you?

1246
01:24:51,304 --> 01:24:54,330
- See anything you like, Col?
- I almost fucking shot you.

1247
01:24:54,507 --> 01:24:57,408
- You're not indulging in self-abuse, are you?
- Sit down.

1248
01:24:57,577 --> 01:25:01,638
I hope you're not turning into one of them
sob sisters wants to get caught.

1249
01:25:02,015 --> 01:25:03,710
You're not cracking up, are you?

1250
01:25:04,651 --> 01:25:07,211
- I don't crack up.
- Pick a place like this...

1251
01:25:07,387 --> 01:25:09,287
...where any cop could see you. Jesus.

1252
01:25:09,456 --> 01:25:12,619
If this is such a fucking bad idea
why'd you show up?

1253
01:25:13,226 --> 01:25:14,887
I own the place.

1254
01:25:17,197 --> 01:25:19,791
Why am I not fucking surprised?

1255
01:25:21,134 --> 01:25:24,865
- All right, lookit, I gotta tell you...
- You're getting reassigned. I know.

1256
01:25:25,572 --> 01:25:27,039
How the fuck do you know that?

1257
01:25:27,207 --> 01:25:29,505
- Where'd they put you?
- Hey, Frank.

1258
01:25:29,676 --> 01:25:33,237
I gotta find myself.

1259
01:25:33,413 --> 01:25:35,005
You're telling me, sonny boy.

1260
01:25:35,615 --> 01:25:38,015
I gotta find the guy
you got in the department.

1261
01:25:38,752 --> 01:25:42,381
With everybody looking up their own ass
and you looking for yourself...

1262
01:25:42,555 --> 01:25:44,614
...I put my money
on nobody finds nothing.

1263
01:25:44,791 --> 01:25:49,228
I know, but, Frank, lookit.
For me, you gotta lay low.

1264
01:25:49,396 --> 01:25:51,227
- Right now.
- Collie...

1265
01:25:51,398 --> 01:25:53,798
...laying low is not what I do.

1266
01:25:53,967 --> 01:25:56,629
All right, fucking Big Daddy Frank.
Fucking perfect.

1267
01:25:56,803 --> 01:25:59,033
What good am I to you
if you don't listen to me?

1268
01:25:59,205 --> 01:26:00,797
What good am I if you don't listen?

1269
01:26:05,945 --> 01:26:08,743
Queenan is compartmentalizing.
He's splitting everything up.

1270
01:26:08,915 --> 01:26:10,576
He's fucking smart. You know this.

1271
01:26:10,750 --> 01:26:14,345
I can get the rat. You just gotta
let me do it my way, Frank.

1272
01:26:17,891 --> 01:26:19,051
Okay.

1273
01:26:22,896 --> 01:26:25,763
But Colin,
I hope I won't have to remind you...

1274
01:26:25,932 --> 01:26:29,959
...that if you don't find that cheese-eating
rat bastard in your department...

1275
01:26:30,136 --> 01:26:34,368
...most likely,
it won't be me who suffers for it.

1276
01:26:35,308 --> 01:26:37,799
Now, why would you have to
remind me of that?

1277
01:26:37,977 --> 01:26:43,142
Would I be any good at what I do
if I didn't fucking already know that?

1278
01:26:43,316 --> 01:26:45,750
Frank, you gotta trust me.

1279
01:26:46,286 --> 01:26:48,652
All right? Just trust me, Frank.

1280
01:26:49,889 --> 01:26:54,451
Hey, it fucking involves lying
and I'm pretty fucking good at that. Right?

1281
01:26:54,627 --> 01:26:56,288
Right?

1282
01:26:56,463 --> 01:26:59,091
Maybe because
it's always been so easy...

1283
01:26:59,265 --> 01:27:03,895
...for me to get cunt that I never understood
jerking off in a theater.

1284
01:27:10,410 --> 01:27:11,968
Christ.

1285
01:27:14,114 --> 01:27:16,639
Who knows what's easy?

1286
01:27:17,417 --> 01:27:22,081
Colin, I know you'll take care
of business.

1287
01:28:06,833 --> 01:28:08,300
Shit!

1288
01:28:47,207 --> 01:28:48,640
Fuck.

1289
01:30:06,786 --> 01:30:08,276
Hey, how you doing?

1290
01:30:08,454 --> 01:30:10,615
Hi, Darlene, hi.

1291
01:30:14,794 --> 01:30:16,659
- That's it for me.
- Yeah, see you.

1292
01:30:16,829 --> 01:30:18,524
Have a good one.

1293
01:30:41,654 --> 01:30:43,815
I smell a rat.

1294
01:30:50,463 --> 01:30:51,691
Jesus Christ.

1295
01:30:52,765 --> 01:30:54,357
You got a girlfriend?

1296
01:30:56,302 --> 01:30:57,963
No.

1297
01:30:58,137 --> 01:31:00,196
No, no. Why, what does that matter?

1298
01:31:01,941 --> 01:31:03,306
It depends.

1299
01:31:05,511 --> 01:31:09,140
I'm sure by now you know...

1300
01:31:09,749 --> 01:31:12,877
...I got an informer in my outfit.

1301
01:31:13,853 --> 01:31:15,081
Cop.

1302
01:31:15,254 --> 01:31:20,521
Staties, Boston Police Department,
I'm not sure.

1303
01:31:20,693 --> 01:31:22,854
Jesus Christ.

1304
01:31:24,464 --> 01:31:27,092
Are you sure it's not the FBI?

1305
01:31:28,568 --> 01:31:31,435
It ain't the FBI.

1306
01:31:32,472 --> 01:31:34,406
Ex-wife.

1307
01:31:35,708 --> 01:31:37,767
Old girlfriend.

1308
01:31:39,145 --> 01:31:41,079
Or stupid.

1309
01:31:42,248 --> 01:31:45,615
That is what brings you down
in this business.

1310
01:31:45,785 --> 01:31:47,480
Stupid, huh?

1311
01:31:48,154 --> 01:31:50,054
Well, I guess that leaves me out.

1312
01:31:54,293 --> 01:31:59,663
You know, past days, situation like this,
I kill everybody.

1313
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:02,834
Everybody who works for me.

1314
01:32:03,302 --> 01:32:05,600
Right. You know, Frank...

1315
01:32:05,772 --> 01:32:07,865
...I look around at your other guys...

1316
01:32:08,674 --> 01:32:11,609
I mean, they're all murderers, right?
Right?

1317
01:32:12,278 --> 01:32:15,441
And I think, "Could I do murder?"

1318
01:32:17,517 --> 01:32:20,680
And all I can answer myself is:

1319
01:32:22,188 --> 01:32:24,213
"What's the difference?"

1320
01:32:24,957 --> 01:32:27,289
Give them up to the Almighty.

1321
01:32:27,827 --> 01:32:30,523
You see, that's my point, you know?

1322
01:32:31,297 --> 01:32:35,791
You accuse me once, I put up with it.

1323
01:32:35,968 --> 01:32:37,299
You accuse me twice...

1324
01:32:38,938 --> 01:32:40,838
...I quit.

1325
01:32:41,441 --> 01:32:45,844
You pressure me to fear for my life and
I will put a fucking bullet in your head...

1326
01:32:46,012 --> 01:32:48,947
...as if you were anybody else. Okay?

1327
01:33:00,092 --> 01:33:03,755
You got something
you wanna ask me?

1328
01:33:05,898 --> 01:33:09,925
Look, you're 70 years old, Frank.
I'm just saying, okay?

1329
01:33:10,803 --> 01:33:13,101
One of your guys is gonna pop you.

1330
01:33:13,272 --> 01:33:15,604
- One of your guys is gonna pop you.
- Yeah, yeah.

1331
01:33:15,775 --> 01:33:18,073
As for running drugs,
what the fuck are you doing?

1332
01:33:18,244 --> 01:33:21,839
You don't need the money or the pain
in the ass. And they will catch you.

1333
01:33:22,014 --> 01:33:24,141
I haven't needed the money...

1334
01:33:24,317 --> 01:33:28,447
...since I took Archie's milk money
in the third grade.

1335
01:33:28,621 --> 01:33:31,886
Tell you the truth,
I don't need pussy anymore, either.

1336
01:33:33,359 --> 01:33:35,190
But I like it.

1337
01:33:36,362 --> 01:33:39,126
Point I'm making here is, Bill...

1338
01:33:39,298 --> 01:33:42,131
...I got this rat...

1339
01:33:42,301 --> 01:33:46,601
...this gnawing,
cheese-eating, fucking rat...

1340
01:33:46,772 --> 01:33:49,172
...and it brings up questions.

1341
01:33:49,342 --> 01:33:53,335
You know. See, Bill, like,
you're the new guy.

1342
01:33:54,580 --> 01:33:56,411
Girlfriend...

1343
01:33:58,251 --> 01:34:03,120
Why don't you stay in the bar
that night I got your numbers?

1344
01:34:03,890 --> 01:34:06,552
Social-security numbers.

1345
01:34:06,726 --> 01:34:09,661
- Yeah.
- Everybody's fucking numbers.

1346
01:34:09,829 --> 01:34:12,627
Is there something that
you just wanna go ahead and ask me?

1347
01:34:12,798 --> 01:34:15,198
Because I'll give you
the fucking answer, all right?

1348
01:34:15,368 --> 01:34:17,302
Frank, look at me. Look at me.

1349
01:34:17,470 --> 01:34:20,769
I'm not the fucking rat. Okay?

1350
01:34:20,940 --> 01:34:22,339
I'm not the fucking rat.

1351
01:34:23,442 --> 01:34:25,774
Start with you agree there is a rat.

1352
01:34:26,679 --> 01:34:28,203
You said there is one, all right?

1353
01:34:28,381 --> 01:34:31,908
I base most of what I do on the idea
that you're pretty good at what you do.

1354
01:34:32,084 --> 01:34:34,177
Sure. Sure, Will.

1355
01:34:34,353 --> 01:34:38,847
You, William. What would you do?

1356
01:34:43,863 --> 01:34:45,387
Frank, how many of these guys...

1357
01:34:45,565 --> 01:34:47,965
...have been with you
long enough to be disgruntled?

1358
01:34:48,134 --> 01:34:51,103
Think about it.
You don't pay much, you know.

1359
01:34:51,270 --> 01:34:54,239
It's almost a fucking feudal enterprise.

1360
01:34:54,407 --> 01:34:57,934
The question is,
and this is the only question...

1361
01:34:58,778 --> 01:35:03,272
...who thinks that they can do what you do
better than you?

1362
01:35:04,216 --> 01:35:07,379
The only one
who could do what I do is me.

1363
01:35:08,654 --> 01:35:12,090
Lot of people had to die
for me to be me.

1364
01:35:14,594 --> 01:35:16,619
You wanna be me?

1365
01:35:20,333 --> 01:35:22,995
I probably could be you. Yeah.

1366
01:35:23,169 --> 01:35:24,659
Yeah, I know that much.

1367
01:35:25,972 --> 01:35:29,032
But I don't wanna be you, Frank.

1368
01:35:29,208 --> 01:35:31,472
I don't wanna be you.

1369
01:35:32,478 --> 01:35:37,415
"Heavy lies the crown" sort of thing.

1370
01:35:37,917 --> 01:35:39,350
Yeah.

1371
01:35:40,186 --> 01:35:42,654
- Francis.
- I'm out of here. You'll set the alarm...

1372
01:35:42,822 --> 01:35:46,918
- Yeah, all right. I'll see you at Christmas.
- All right. Good night.

1373
01:35:49,428 --> 01:35:52,295
You know what I like about restaurants?

1374
01:35:52,465 --> 01:35:54,330
The fucking food? I don't know. What?

1375
01:35:54,834 --> 01:35:58,736
You learn a lot watching things eat.

1376
01:36:00,973 --> 01:36:03,305
There's a boat coming up Gloucester.

1377
01:36:04,276 --> 01:36:07,109
French will give you all the details.
Don't forget.

1378
01:36:07,279 --> 01:36:10,442
Eat something, for Christ's sake.

1379
01:36:14,620 --> 01:36:19,853
In the future, I tell you to do a thing,
you fucking do it. You got that?

1380
01:36:20,693 --> 01:36:22,957
I got it. Okay?

1381
01:36:25,331 --> 01:36:26,889
Excuse me...

1382
01:36:27,066 --> 01:36:29,728
...French, I forgot my...
- Okay, Francis.

1383
01:36:29,902 --> 01:36:30,891
...cigarette.

1384
01:36:33,873 --> 01:36:36,205
Eat something.

1385
01:36:44,850 --> 01:36:45,839
Problem?

1386
01:36:46,018 --> 01:36:49,545
Yeah, I got a problem. I run rat fucks
like you, okay? I don't like them.

1387
01:36:49,722 --> 01:36:52,054
The day you wouldn't take a promotion,
let me know.

1388
01:36:52,224 --> 01:36:54,351
If you'd taken care of this
I wouldn't be here.

1389
01:36:54,527 --> 01:36:58,054
- Fuck yourself, you piece of shit.
- I need the identity of your undercovers.

1390
01:36:58,230 --> 01:37:01,791
Blow me. Not literally. Unfortunately,
there's no promotion involved for you.

1391
01:37:01,967 --> 01:37:02,956
Fucking prick.

1392
01:37:03,369 --> 01:37:06,361
- Hi, captain.
- Look who's here. The prom queen.

1393
01:37:06,539 --> 01:37:08,871
- They are not happy with me.
- What do you expect?

1394
01:37:09,208 --> 01:37:12,541
Everybody knows you've been assigned here
to find Costello's rat.

1395
01:37:13,312 --> 01:37:15,906
They want to find the leak
as much as you do.

1396
01:37:16,382 --> 01:37:20,443
Like I said, two days ago, my guy
damn near found out who Costello's rat is.

1397
01:37:22,188 --> 01:37:25,089
- But he lost him in the streets.
- Really?

1398
01:37:27,426 --> 01:37:30,691
- Well, did he get a look at the guy?
- No.

1399
01:37:30,863 --> 01:37:33,627
I mean, nothing? Like, I mean,
anything that could help us.

1400
01:37:33,799 --> 01:37:35,027
No.

1401
01:37:37,503 --> 01:37:40,404
So you got any advice for me?
Just, I mean, generally.

1402
01:37:41,173 --> 01:37:44,870
Costello can't do much business without
coordinating with his source...

1403
01:37:45,044 --> 01:37:46,909
...who is here in SIU.

1404
01:37:48,681 --> 01:37:51,047
Follow Costello. You'll find his rat.

1405
01:37:58,691 --> 01:38:01,319
You're gonna be looking at my people...

1406
01:38:01,527 --> 01:38:05,759
...going through their bank statements,
their phone calls and medical records.

1407
01:38:05,931 --> 01:38:10,732
Don't be surprised if they don't buy you
a beer or invite you into their homes.

1408
01:38:12,171 --> 01:38:14,162
Let me get you a coffee.

1409
01:38:17,109 --> 01:38:20,340
If I wasrt
with the Massachusetts State Police...

1410
01:38:20,980 --> 01:38:23,915
...if I did it full-time, law school...

1411
01:38:24,517 --> 01:38:26,678
...I'd be through it in a year.

1412
01:38:27,987 --> 01:38:29,887
If I wasrt a trooper.

1413
01:38:34,193 --> 01:38:37,026
But another city. I was thinking that.

1414
01:38:38,264 --> 01:38:39,993
Another city.

1415
01:38:40,232 --> 01:38:42,564
Another city, huh?

1416
01:38:44,069 --> 01:38:47,197
Yeah, well, that would be a clean slate.

1417
01:38:47,740 --> 01:38:51,005
I want you to know,
you don't got to stay.

1418
01:38:53,345 --> 01:38:55,142
If we're not gonna make it...

1419
01:38:55,314 --> 01:38:59,774
...it's gotta be you that gets out,
because I'm not capable.

1420
01:39:01,086 --> 01:39:05,420
I'm fucking Irish. I'll deal with something
being wrong for the rest of my life.

1421
01:39:14,200 --> 01:39:18,034
It might not be a bad idea,
you know, another city.

1422
01:39:36,288 --> 01:39:39,052
- Of course I know how to spot a cop.
- How's that?

1423
01:39:39,225 --> 01:39:42,251
If he's not paying attention to us,
he's a cop.

1424
01:39:42,428 --> 01:39:45,693
Lookit. You see that guy over there?
Right over there.

1425
01:39:45,865 --> 01:39:46,854
Yeah.

1426
01:39:47,032 --> 01:39:50,729
Not paying attention to us.
He's a cop.

1427
01:39:51,370 --> 01:39:54,203
- Okay.
- You get it now, do you?

1428
01:40:00,145 --> 01:40:02,113
- What about this guy?
- Cop.

1429
01:40:04,683 --> 01:40:07,413
Hey, how you doing?
What kind of dog is that?

1430
01:40:09,188 --> 01:40:11,520
She ignored us so she must be a cop.

1431
01:40:11,690 --> 01:40:13,988
She's probably
the fucking police commissioner.

1432
01:40:25,504 --> 01:40:29,531
You can get out of here. I'm using
a new crew tonight. New guys.

1433
01:40:31,277 --> 01:40:35,907
- I thought I was on for this.
- I changed my mind. Take the night off.

1434
01:40:36,081 --> 01:40:40,279
Francis, we're ready for the sushi bar.

1435
01:40:41,053 --> 01:40:43,613
- Jimmy, bring a mop.
- Out the back.

1436
01:40:44,623 --> 01:40:46,716
There's guys who answer
the questions right...

1437
01:40:46,892 --> 01:40:49,190
...and there's guys that don't.
- And a pail.

1438
01:40:51,597 --> 01:40:53,224
You're a cop.

1439
01:40:53,699 --> 01:40:55,030
What?

1440
01:40:55,200 --> 01:40:57,327
You ignored us, you're a cop.

1441
01:40:58,370 --> 01:41:02,101
We're guessing who cops are. You know,
most good-Iooking women are cops.

1442
01:41:03,542 --> 01:41:06,670
Well, I'm going home, all right?
He's playing with his new guys.

1443
01:41:06,845 --> 01:41:08,779
- See you later, all right?
- See you later.

1444
01:41:15,621 --> 01:41:18,681
He's moving something with all new guys.
A whole new crew.

1445
01:41:18,857 --> 01:41:22,054
No, no, I can't tell you what or where.
It's probably disinformation.

1446
01:41:22,227 --> 01:41:25,526
Just keep following him, all right?
Listen, I need to see you today.

1447
01:41:25,698 --> 01:41:27,131
- Tomorrow.
- No, no, no. Today.

1448
01:41:27,299 --> 01:41:29,665
- You heard nothing about drugs?
- No.

1449
01:41:29,835 --> 01:41:33,293
Nothing about new guys?
Nothing about Gloucester?

1450
01:41:33,472 --> 01:41:37,238
Not a thing. And I would have.
That information would have come to me.

1451
01:41:39,111 --> 01:41:40,738
It ain't Bill.

1452
01:41:40,913 --> 01:41:42,676
No way, he says.

1453
01:41:55,194 --> 01:41:57,560
Follow Costello. You'll find his rat.

1454
01:41:57,730 --> 01:41:59,254
Yeah, this is Sergeant Sullivan.

1455
01:41:59,431 --> 01:42:03,834
I want constant surveillance
on Captain Queenan, starting right now.

1456
01:42:04,870 --> 01:42:06,565
Good. Thank you.

1457
01:42:09,408 --> 01:42:13,344
Can I ask a question, sarge? Why the fuck
are we following Captain Queenan?

1458
01:42:13,512 --> 01:42:15,412
To find out about the good Catholic life?

1459
01:42:15,581 --> 01:42:18,744
I have to follow every lead,
however unlikely...

1460
01:42:18,917 --> 01:42:22,683
...however fucking painful it might be
to your delicate fucking sensibilities.

1461
01:42:22,855 --> 01:42:24,846
Who told you I had delicate sensibilities?

1462
01:42:25,024 --> 01:42:28,551
- I just don't like it, sarge. Don't feel right.
- I have reason to believe...

1463
01:42:28,727 --> 01:42:31,457
...that Captain Queenan is Costello's rat.

1464
01:42:31,630 --> 01:42:33,928
So just follow him and don't get made.

1465
01:42:37,269 --> 01:42:40,136
Sarge, we got the target coming out.

1466
01:43:16,608 --> 01:43:17,836
Hey. Where are you?

1467
01:43:18,010 --> 01:43:19,978
Look down the car.

1468
01:43:21,380 --> 01:43:23,848
- You got me?
- Yeah, I gotcha.

1469
01:43:24,016 --> 01:43:25,881
Is there a reason you would have a tail?

1470
01:43:26,385 --> 01:43:27,784
No.

1471
01:43:29,421 --> 01:43:32,254
- Because I think...
- Billy, I don't have a tail.

1472
01:43:33,592 --> 01:43:37,221
Get off at the next stop, all right?
South Station. You wait there 10 minutes.

1473
01:43:37,396 --> 01:43:39,660
South Station. Wait 10 minutes.

1474
01:44:15,601 --> 01:44:18,798
He just went into a building
down the waterfront. 344 Wash.

1475
01:44:18,971 --> 01:44:21,496
You got that? 344 Wash.

1476
01:44:25,677 --> 01:44:27,304
Yeah, he went up to the top floor.

1477
01:44:31,884 --> 01:44:34,546
Building's empty. No tenants here.

1478
01:44:36,054 --> 01:44:39,353
He's got dope coming in.
I don't know where. He...

1479
01:44:40,192 --> 01:44:41,682
He's getting spooky, captain.

1480
01:44:41,860 --> 01:44:42,986
- What?
- I just saw him.

1481
01:44:43,162 --> 01:44:45,687
He had blood on his hands.
He's lost his fucking mind.

1482
01:44:52,271 --> 01:44:54,705
I don't know
what we're doing here, boys.

1483
01:44:55,340 --> 01:44:58,309
He's not including his regular guys.
But I'll tell you something.

1484
01:44:58,477 --> 01:45:02,004
Sooner or later he's gonna find out
who I am and he's gonna fucking kill me.

1485
01:45:02,181 --> 01:45:04,513
- I know it. He's gonna fucking kill me!
- All right!

1486
01:45:11,356 --> 01:45:14,325
I think we got him. I think Queenars
meeting with him right now.

1487
01:45:14,493 --> 01:45:16,188
All right, all right. Listen to me.

1488
01:45:16,361 --> 01:45:19,159
I'm really sorry for your trouble.
I swear to God I am.

1489
01:45:19,331 --> 01:45:22,596
I'll get you out of this. I can't
do it overnight but I'll get you out.

1490
01:45:23,669 --> 01:45:24,727
Yeah?

1491
01:45:24,903 --> 01:45:27,599
Hey, get the van. We're moving.
Heavy work.

1492
01:45:27,773 --> 01:45:30,105
- What about the FBI?
- They're compromised.

1493
01:45:30,275 --> 01:45:31,708
- They're what?
- They're fucked.

1494
01:45:35,747 --> 01:45:36,907
- Yeah.
- Where are you?

1495
01:45:37,082 --> 01:45:39,380
We've been trying to reach you.
We found the rat.

1496
01:45:39,851 --> 01:45:41,842
Listen, we're gonna take him out.
Lookit:

1497
01:45:42,020 --> 01:45:44,614
The address is 314 Washington Street.
You got it?

1498
01:45:44,790 --> 01:45:46,223
All right, we'll see you there.

1499
01:45:46,758 --> 01:45:47,986
- What?
- You were followed.

1500
01:45:48,160 --> 01:45:49,752
- By who?
- By Costello's people.

1501
01:45:49,928 --> 01:45:51,361
- Impossible.
- One of the cops...

1502
01:45:51,530 --> 01:45:54,260
...he's got on the inside tipped him.
Come on. Come on.

1503
01:45:55,234 --> 01:45:56,758
Come on!

1504
01:46:03,408 --> 01:46:05,876
What the fuck is going on?

1505
01:46:06,979 --> 01:46:09,812
Fucking shit. Looks like Queenars
meeting with all of them.

1506
01:46:10,716 --> 01:46:13,150
Yeah, he must be our guy.

1507
01:46:13,318 --> 01:46:16,617
Sarge, we gotta get him out of here.
Those guys aren't fucking around.

1508
01:46:21,560 --> 01:46:24,393
Ah, Christ, it's too late.
Let's go back up.

1509
01:46:28,467 --> 01:46:30,264
- Shit!
- You got to get out of here!

1510
01:46:30,435 --> 01:46:32,266
- Take the fire escape.
- What about you?

1511
01:46:32,437 --> 01:46:35,463
I'll be fine. But if you get made
I can't protect you. Now, go!

1512
01:46:53,091 --> 01:46:55,651
- One of you mugs got a light?
- Where's your boy?

1513
01:46:55,827 --> 01:46:58,853
- He's studying law at Notre Dame.
- Where's your fucking boy?

1514
01:46:59,031 --> 01:47:01,124
- Hey! Hey!
- Goddamn motherfucker!

1515
01:47:01,300 --> 01:47:03,325
- Fucking kill you!
- Where's your fucking boy?

1516
01:47:19,651 --> 01:47:22,643
What the fuck was that?
Did you fucking see that?

1517
01:47:26,992 --> 01:47:29,017
Sarge, something
just came off the building.

1518
01:47:29,828 --> 01:47:31,887
What the fuck?

1519
01:47:34,966 --> 01:47:35,955
Fuck.

1520
01:47:36,134 --> 01:47:38,034
What do you mean,
off the building?

1521
01:47:38,203 --> 01:47:40,899
- Something came off the fucking roof.
- It's a fucking body.

1522
01:47:49,614 --> 01:47:51,514
We can't get a visual.
Want us to get out?

1523
01:47:51,683 --> 01:47:54,447
We gotta get on foot
if you want me to get up on this thing.

1524
01:47:55,053 --> 01:47:56,543
- Where were you?
- What happened?

1525
01:47:56,722 --> 01:47:58,519
You're fucking late! Get in the van!

1526
01:47:58,690 --> 01:48:00,055
What do you mean,
off the roof?

1527
01:48:00,225 --> 01:48:01,886
What's going on? I came to meet you.

1528
01:48:02,060 --> 01:48:03,584
- What the fuck...?
- Get in the van!

1529
01:48:03,762 --> 01:48:06,697
I got four armed men right out front.
You want us to pursue?

1530
01:48:06,865 --> 01:48:08,924
No, do not pursue. Stay in the car.

1531
01:48:09,101 --> 01:48:11,228
- Fuck. No fucking pursuit.
- I need information.

1532
01:48:11,403 --> 01:48:12,768
What came off the roof?

1533
01:48:12,938 --> 01:48:14,428
- No pursuit.
- That's bullshit.

1534
01:48:14,606 --> 01:48:16,369
Fuck this.

1535
01:48:24,449 --> 01:48:26,076
Fitzy! Get in the van!

1536
01:48:27,586 --> 01:48:30,521
Get in the fucking van! Let's go! Move!

1537
01:48:30,689 --> 01:48:32,316
All right. I got him.

1538
01:48:38,764 --> 01:48:40,959
32X to CP. We're being fired upon!

1539
01:48:41,133 --> 01:48:44,534
An officer is down. I repeat,
an officer is down. A trooper's been shot!

1540
01:48:44,703 --> 01:48:46,728
Send some back...

1541
01:49:04,089 --> 01:49:07,252
So do you know
why Queenan went into that building?

1542
01:49:07,426 --> 01:49:09,257
- No.
- Well, a better question...

1543
01:49:09,428 --> 01:49:11,589
...is why the fuck
were your guys following him?

1544
01:49:11,763 --> 01:49:14,493
I told Internal Investigations
to follow Captain Queenan.

1545
01:49:14,666 --> 01:49:17,066
- Why?
- That's Internal Investigations' business.

1546
01:49:17,969 --> 01:49:19,630
Fucking piece of shit!

1547
01:49:19,805 --> 01:49:21,295
- All right.
- Hey, hey!

1548
01:49:21,473 --> 01:49:22,838
- Fucking bitch!
- Let him go!

1549
01:49:23,008 --> 01:49:26,171
Cocksucker! I don't have to fucking explain
anything to anybody!

1550
01:49:26,344 --> 01:49:28,505
I can fucking investigate
anybody I want to!

1551
01:49:28,680 --> 01:49:30,910
- Come on!
- I don't give a fuck what you think!

1552
01:49:31,082 --> 01:49:34,483
I got reason to believe that Queenan
got killed by his fucking undercover.

1553
01:49:34,653 --> 01:49:35,745
That's a fucking lie.

1554
01:49:35,921 --> 01:49:39,482
He has fucking information
in a locked file, as did Captain Queenan.

1555
01:49:39,658 --> 01:49:41,250
I need access to those files.

1556
01:49:41,426 --> 01:49:44,452
I forgot the password but
if you come with me I'll give it to you.

1557
01:49:44,629 --> 01:49:46,756
- That's a fucking lie.
- Nobody calls me a liar!

1558
01:49:46,932 --> 01:49:49,730
Shut up! Work with the tech guys
to unlock those files.

1559
01:49:49,901 --> 01:49:52,768
- Dignam, take a leave of absence.
- Take a leave of what?

1560
01:49:52,938 --> 01:49:55,873
Queenan is dead. I'm your boss now.

1561
01:49:56,041 --> 01:49:58,407
I don't care.
I'd rather hand in my papers first.

1562
01:49:58,577 --> 01:50:01,978
World needs plenty of bartenders.
Two weeks with pay.

1563
01:50:02,147 --> 01:50:03,614
Good.

1564
01:50:05,450 --> 01:50:07,042
- Piece of shit.
- Fuck off.

1565
01:50:08,987 --> 01:50:10,818
- I need those codes.
- No.

1566
01:50:10,989 --> 01:50:13,116
You want those codes.

1567
01:50:16,228 --> 01:50:17,957
So where the fuck were you?

1568
01:50:19,631 --> 01:50:22,191
Well, boss told me to go home.

1569
01:50:22,367 --> 01:50:26,565
Whatever. Maybe he did, maybe he didn't.
But you werert at fucking home.

1570
01:50:26,738 --> 01:50:28,205
So where the fuck were you?

1571
01:50:28,807 --> 01:50:31,708
I was at the grocery store
with no signal, all right?

1572
01:50:31,877 --> 01:50:33,868
When I got the signal, I got the call.

1573
01:50:34,045 --> 01:50:37,071
What the fuck do you want from me?
Was I there or was I not there?

1574
01:50:37,249 --> 01:50:39,308
Billy. Billy.

1575
01:50:45,690 --> 01:50:47,214
Yeah?

1576
01:50:49,427 --> 01:50:51,418
Yeah?

1577
01:50:51,897 --> 01:50:54,058
You know what I thought today?

1578
01:50:55,867 --> 01:50:57,562
What's that?

1579
01:50:58,570 --> 01:51:02,028
Who didn't show up today is the rat.

1580
01:51:05,510 --> 01:51:06,875
Yeah?

1581
01:51:07,913 --> 01:51:11,713
- So?
- And you never been late in your life.

1582
01:51:13,618 --> 01:51:15,848
When I called you...

1583
01:51:16,021 --> 01:51:18,251
...I made a mistake.

1584
01:51:18,423 --> 01:51:22,223
I gave you the wrong address...

1585
01:51:22,394 --> 01:51:26,228
...but you showed up at the right one...

1586
01:51:26,698 --> 01:51:28,598
...didn't you?

1587
01:51:29,868 --> 01:51:32,428
Tell me why I didn't tell nobody, huh?

1588
01:51:33,705 --> 01:51:35,036
Tell me why.

1589
01:51:57,929 --> 01:52:01,330
That cop was tough.
We were excessive with the cop.

1590
01:52:01,499 --> 01:52:03,296
He's dead.

1591
01:52:03,468 --> 01:52:05,095
I'm going home.

1592
01:52:05,270 --> 01:52:08,068
- Your guys should not have done that.
- One of us had to die.

1593
01:52:08,239 --> 01:52:10,264
With me it tends to be the other guy.

1594
01:52:10,442 --> 01:52:11,909
But Queenan.
Now I got no access.

1595
01:52:12,077 --> 01:52:15,274
You killed the guy who had the info.
Dignam's gone. Forget about him.

1596
01:52:15,447 --> 01:52:18,109
- He resigned.
- I don't give a fuck about Dignam.

1597
01:52:18,283 --> 01:52:19,750
He put in his papers, Frank.

1598
01:52:19,918 --> 01:52:23,979
- He left. I don't know where he is.
- Don't get your balls in an uproar, Collie.

1599
01:52:24,155 --> 01:52:25,588
That Irish pissant...

1600
01:52:25,757 --> 01:52:29,420
...he's so hot for me, we give him
a whiff of my ass, he'll crawl right in it.

1601
01:52:29,594 --> 01:52:31,653
Let's give him a whiff.

1602
01:52:31,830 --> 01:52:35,493
- I will.
- Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

1603
01:52:37,168 --> 01:52:38,829
Sweetheart.

1604
01:52:39,004 --> 01:52:41,199
You're giving me a hard-on.

1605
01:52:41,806 --> 01:52:43,205
Are you sure it's me?

1606
01:52:43,708 --> 01:52:46,973
Not all that talk
about whiffing and crawling up asses?

1607
01:52:47,445 --> 01:52:49,436
Watch your fucking mouth.

1608
01:52:49,614 --> 01:52:52,048
No. You watch it.

1609
01:52:52,751 --> 01:52:55,049
Let me straighten you out.

1610
01:53:02,961 --> 01:53:05,828
I tried to call you a few times.

1611
01:53:09,034 --> 01:53:10,797
I know.

1612
01:53:37,195 --> 01:53:41,097
Listen, I can't be a friend to you.

1613
01:53:46,237 --> 01:53:48,137
I'm sorry.

1614
01:53:54,612 --> 01:53:56,341
Yeah...

1615
01:54:00,919 --> 01:54:02,546
...I know.

1616
01:56:11,182 --> 01:56:12,672
Yeah.

1617
01:56:13,484 --> 01:56:16,715
You called this number
on a dead guy's phone.

1618
01:56:17,155 --> 01:56:18,713
Who are you?

1619
01:56:18,957 --> 01:56:21,221
So it is you.

1620
01:56:22,427 --> 01:56:25,419
Well, thank God you're all right.
We were very worried.

1621
01:56:26,831 --> 01:56:28,458
Who are you?

1622
01:56:29,367 --> 01:56:31,392
This is Sergeant Sullivan.

1623
01:56:31,569 --> 01:56:33,332
I'm taking over Queenars unit.

1624
01:56:34,038 --> 01:56:36,063
Let me talk to Dignam
to confirm it.

1625
01:56:36,241 --> 01:56:37,572
Staff Sergeant Dignam...

1626
01:56:37,742 --> 01:56:40,939
...is on a leave of absence.
He's very upset.

1627
01:56:41,112 --> 01:56:43,307
We're all very upset.

1628
01:56:43,948 --> 01:56:46,712
I think the best thing would be
for you to come in.

1629
01:56:47,685 --> 01:56:50,586
We need you to come in.
Can you come in?

1630
01:56:52,056 --> 01:56:53,045
We'll meet...

1631
01:57:32,230 --> 01:57:34,528
Police confirm
the body of the man found dead...

1632
01:57:34,699 --> 01:57:36,667
...in the Fenway marshes
yesterday...

1633
01:57:36,834 --> 01:57:39,826
...is that of Timothy Delahunt,
an undercover policeman for...

1634
01:57:40,004 --> 01:57:42,495
...the city of Boston.
This was the scene yesterday...

1635
01:57:42,674 --> 01:57:45,643
...when Delahunt's body was found
in the marshes near the Fenway.

1636
01:57:45,810 --> 01:57:47,368
As for who did this or why...

1637
01:57:47,545 --> 01:57:49,945
...that's something police
are working on right now.

1638
01:57:50,114 --> 01:57:53,572
- I don't believe it.
- What can't you believe?

1639
01:57:53,818 --> 01:57:57,276
I spent all fucking night dragging
the poor bastard in there.

1640
01:57:57,455 --> 01:57:59,389
Tell me how they found him so fast.

1641
01:57:59,557 --> 01:58:02,185
Somebody walking
a fucking dog in three feet of mud?

1642
01:58:02,360 --> 01:58:04,521
What kind of fucking
size of dog is that?

1643
01:58:04,696 --> 01:58:06,823
Must have been a big fucking dog, man.

1644
01:58:06,998 --> 01:58:09,228
I spent all fucking night doing it, man.

1645
01:58:09,600 --> 01:58:10,897
I'm embarrassed.

1646
01:58:11,569 --> 01:58:14,231
I still don't believe he was a cop.
I don't believe it.

1647
01:58:14,405 --> 01:58:18,933
The cops are saying he's a cop...

1648
01:58:19,310 --> 01:58:21,505
...so I won't look for the cop.

1649
01:58:22,780 --> 01:58:24,407
Are you soft, Fitz?

1650
01:58:24,582 --> 01:58:29,542
When I tell you to dump
a body in the marsh...

1651
01:58:29,721 --> 01:58:32,656
...you dump him in the marsh.

1652
01:58:33,691 --> 01:58:36,990
Not where some guy from
John Hancock goes every Thursday...

1653
01:58:37,161 --> 01:58:39,254
...to get a fucking blowjob!

1654
01:58:40,031 --> 01:58:42,192
Don't laugh!

1655
01:58:43,034 --> 01:58:45,935
This ain't reality TV!

1656
01:58:49,874 --> 01:58:51,637
Proceed.

1657
01:59:14,098 --> 01:59:15,565
- What?
- Yeah.

1658
01:59:15,733 --> 01:59:18,497
You got a tail. Two cars.
Not very subtle.

1659
01:59:18,669 --> 01:59:22,230
They're not gonna be subtle from now on.
That's what I've been trying to say.

1660
01:59:22,407 --> 01:59:23,533
So get rid of them.

1661
01:59:23,708 --> 01:59:26,802
There's no need for you
to go yourself, Frank.

1662
01:59:26,978 --> 01:59:29,208
Get rid of the fucking tail!

1663
01:59:34,152 --> 01:59:35,710
All right.

1664
01:59:42,026 --> 01:59:45,223
Fucking rats.
It's wearing me thin.

1665
01:59:45,396 --> 01:59:48,194
Francis, it's a nation of fucking rats.

1666
02:00:04,515 --> 02:00:07,848
Stop, stop. Pull them off Costello.
There's no need to surveil him.

1667
02:00:08,019 --> 02:00:10,385
- What are you saying?
- I got it from an undercover.

1668
02:00:10,555 --> 02:00:13,217
He knows he's being followed.
So let the UC take him in.

1669
02:00:13,424 --> 02:00:14,789
- Undercover?
- Queenars guy.

1670
02:00:14,959 --> 02:00:17,621
He called when he found out
Queenan died. I'm running him.

1671
02:00:17,795 --> 02:00:20,730
- You give him to me.
- No, I can give you Costello's destination.

1672
02:00:20,932 --> 02:00:23,400
- You know where he's going?
- Yes. And what he's doing.

1673
02:00:23,568 --> 02:00:25,729
Get rid of the tail,
get Special Ops on standby.

1674
02:00:25,903 --> 02:00:28,337
- We'll take this prick tonight.
- Let's go. Now.

1675
02:00:28,506 --> 02:00:31,498
All units fall back.
All units fall back.

1676
02:00:51,863 --> 02:00:53,922
It's the warehouse he owns
over on Sheffield.

1677
02:00:54,098 --> 02:00:56,692
He's gotta have a container or a truck
or something there. Go.

1678
02:01:20,992 --> 02:01:22,516
Load it.

1679
02:01:30,535 --> 02:01:32,833
Frank, how do you know
you don't have a tail, huh?

1680
02:01:34,105 --> 02:01:36,073
Were you not in the fucking car?

1681
02:01:36,240 --> 02:01:39,300
Yeah, what if they took one off
and they put another one on?

1682
02:01:42,513 --> 02:01:44,310
Load.

1683
02:01:51,889 --> 02:01:53,720
Go, go!

1684
02:01:56,160 --> 02:01:57,718
Come on,
what are you waiting for?

1685
02:01:59,797 --> 02:02:01,924
Frank wants me to check
the back. You go ahead.

1686
02:02:02,099 --> 02:02:05,557
- Watch your fucking back.
- Move out! Go on!

1687
02:02:14,579 --> 02:02:17,013
Cocksuckers.

1688
02:02:23,020 --> 02:02:25,580
Motherfucking shit!

1689
02:02:29,026 --> 02:02:30,687
Motherfucking...!

1690
02:02:34,098 --> 02:02:36,362
Back the fuck up!

1691
02:02:36,534 --> 02:02:38,627
They fucking shot me.

1692
02:02:42,340 --> 02:02:43,466
Get down!

1693
02:02:46,477 --> 02:02:48,035
Come on, fucking bastards!

1694
02:03:06,764 --> 02:03:08,231
Fuck it.

1695
02:03:47,672 --> 02:03:51,438
How the fuck did this happen?

1696
02:03:52,843 --> 02:03:55,437
You're an FBI informant?

1697
02:03:55,613 --> 02:03:57,808
Are you fucking kidding me?

1698
02:03:59,283 --> 02:04:00,978
Grow up.

1699
02:04:01,686 --> 02:04:04,621
Of course I talk to the FBI.

1700
02:04:04,789 --> 02:04:06,279
Do they know who I am?

1701
02:04:08,225 --> 02:04:12,594
I never gave up anybody
who wasrt going down anyway.

1702
02:04:13,631 --> 02:04:16,065
Nobody knows nothing.

1703
02:04:17,668 --> 02:04:19,158
Frank.

1704
02:04:19,470 --> 02:04:22,371
Frank. Frank.

1705
02:04:22,540 --> 02:04:24,531
Do they know about me?

1706
02:04:26,243 --> 02:04:28,768
I know about you, Collie.

1707
02:04:28,946 --> 02:04:31,779
You know I'd never give you up.

1708
02:04:32,516 --> 02:04:35,280
- You're like a...
- What? Like a son?

1709
02:04:36,187 --> 02:04:39,554
To you? Is that what this is about?

1710
02:04:40,524 --> 02:04:44,858
All that murdering and fucking,
and no sons.

1711
02:05:06,884 --> 02:05:09,318
Fucking rat prick!

1712
02:05:30,908 --> 02:05:32,500
Frank?

1713
02:05:32,676 --> 02:05:34,166
Yeah?

1714
02:05:35,913 --> 02:05:37,141
Who's this?

1715
02:05:39,049 --> 02:05:40,676
Gwen?

1716
02:05:41,819 --> 02:05:43,912
Where the hell's Frank?

1717
02:05:44,989 --> 02:05:46,786
Frank got shot.

1718
02:05:49,627 --> 02:05:52,027
Gwen, we lost Frank.

1719
02:06:00,404 --> 02:06:02,031
I got him!

1720
02:06:02,206 --> 02:06:04,640
I got Costello here!

1721
02:06:08,779 --> 02:06:11,270
Hey, good job, sarge.

1722
02:06:12,049 --> 02:06:13,607
No, it's...

1723
02:06:15,019 --> 02:06:16,611
For you.

1724
02:06:17,688 --> 02:06:20,748
- Thank you.
- No. Thank you.

1725
02:06:24,261 --> 02:06:27,492
He's been waiting here
a long time for you.

1726
02:06:27,698 --> 02:06:30,132
How'd you get him without the files?

1727
02:06:30,301 --> 02:06:33,099
Caller ID on Queenars phone.

1728
02:06:34,071 --> 02:06:35,436
You know that guy?

1729
02:06:35,606 --> 02:06:38,473
Yeah. We were classmates
in the academy together.

1730
02:06:45,916 --> 02:06:47,577
Good to see you, trooper.

1731
02:06:47,751 --> 02:06:50,413
- Yeah.
- Colin Sullivan. We spoke on the phone.

1732
02:06:50,588 --> 02:06:52,146
- Yeah.
- So.

1733
02:06:53,691 --> 02:06:55,454
Now, how long were you undercover?

1734
02:06:55,626 --> 02:06:57,526
Long time.

1735
02:06:57,695 --> 02:06:59,526
- Long fucking time.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1736
02:06:59,930 --> 02:07:04,867
Well, I can't even tell you the debt...

1737
02:07:07,705 --> 02:07:11,038
I just want you to know I'll be
recommending you for the Medal of Merit.

1738
02:07:11,208 --> 02:07:12,903
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1739
02:07:13,844 --> 02:07:16,210
That's kind of like a gold star
around here, huh?

1740
02:07:18,249 --> 02:07:20,046
It's the highest honor we got.

1741
02:07:20,217 --> 02:07:23,015
Look, I just want
my identity back, all right?

1742
02:07:23,187 --> 02:07:25,178
- That's all.
- All right.

1743
02:07:25,356 --> 02:07:28,257
- I understand. You wanna be a cop again.
- No, no.

1744
02:07:28,425 --> 02:07:32,020
Being a cop's not an identity.
I want my identity back.

1745
02:07:32,296 --> 02:07:35,265
Check your computer. Go on.
You'll have to excuse my behavior.

1746
02:07:35,432 --> 02:07:39,391
My only contact in the last six months
has been a police shrink.

1747
02:07:42,039 --> 02:07:44,337
How's that working for you?

1748
02:07:44,508 --> 02:07:46,237
Is it helpful?

1749
02:07:46,977 --> 02:07:49,741
What are you gonna do
about Costello's rat in this building?

1750
02:07:52,349 --> 02:07:55,580
- I'm gonna find the prick.
- Yeah.

1751
02:07:56,020 --> 02:07:58,716
I'm gonna find him, I'm gonna arrest him.

1752
02:07:58,889 --> 02:08:02,052
- Good.
- Anything you can do to help me...

1753
02:08:02,226 --> 02:08:06,060
You know, I mean, did Frank ever
mention a name...? You know, anything.

1754
02:08:06,230 --> 02:08:08,824
Someone he was in contact with.
Anything you can give me.

1755
02:08:08,999 --> 02:08:11,559
I'm all done being a cop, all right?

1756
02:08:11,735 --> 02:08:13,896
I just want my money
and I wanna go home.

1757
02:08:14,071 --> 02:08:16,471
All right. That'll be
the best thing for everybody.

1758
02:08:16,640 --> 02:08:18,039
Fair enough.

1759
02:08:18,642 --> 02:08:23,102
I just, I can't get into your file
unless I have your password.

1760
02:08:25,282 --> 02:08:26,306
It's my name.

1761
02:08:27,117 --> 02:08:29,483
William Costigan Jr.

1762
02:08:29,653 --> 02:08:32,918
They gave it to me in case I had to
explain myself to someone like you.

1763
02:08:33,490 --> 02:08:35,424
It's your name.

1764
02:08:37,528 --> 02:08:38,927
All right.

1765
02:08:39,096 --> 02:08:41,792
Fucking unreal, that...
Well, makes a lot of sense.

1766
02:08:41,966 --> 02:08:44,196
Listen, Bill, I gotta run this
in the other room.

1767
02:08:44,368 --> 02:08:46,632
This computer's getting
all frigging blooey on me.

1768
02:08:46,804 --> 02:08:50,570
Give me two minutes. I'll have
you out of here in no time.

1769
02:10:23,901 --> 02:10:27,735
All right, everything checks out,
so let's get you paid.

1770
02:10:58,702 --> 02:11:00,465
I know.

1771
02:11:02,005 --> 02:11:04,496
I know. I'm not...
I'm not here for that, okay?

1772
02:11:04,775 --> 02:11:06,367
I'm not.

1773
02:11:08,579 --> 02:11:11,844
Listen. I've gotta give you something.

1774
02:11:12,015 --> 02:11:14,449
Something I need you to keep.

1775
02:11:14,618 --> 02:11:16,210
For me.

1776
02:11:18,489 --> 02:11:20,081
Okay?

1777
02:11:23,694 --> 02:11:27,994
- What is it?
- This is for you to hold. Only you.

1778
02:11:28,165 --> 02:11:32,124
You open this if something happens to me
or if I call you and I tell you to open it.

1779
02:11:32,302 --> 02:11:34,862
You're the only person
I can trust, all right?

1780
02:11:36,473 --> 02:11:38,065
Please.

1781
02:11:41,612 --> 02:11:44,012
- All right.
- Look, I'm sorry to even...

1782
02:11:44,181 --> 02:11:46,877
I'm sorry to even show up here
like this, you know?

1783
02:11:47,050 --> 02:11:50,315
L... There's just no one else
I could give it to.

1784
02:11:51,755 --> 02:11:53,916
There's no one else.

1785
02:11:54,691 --> 02:11:57,421
- I'm really sorry.
- I...

1786
02:11:58,028 --> 02:11:59,996
You know, I have...

1787
02:12:00,164 --> 02:12:02,598
- I...
- Whatever you have to say...

1788
02:12:02,766 --> 02:12:04,961
...think about it real hard, all right?

1789
02:12:05,135 --> 02:12:08,662
If you still wanna tell me,
you tell me in two weeks, okay?

1790
02:12:38,435 --> 02:12:40,369
I was dreaming I was dead.

1791
02:12:41,738 --> 02:12:45,936
Death is hard. Life is much easier.

1792
02:12:46,877 --> 02:12:50,108
- What's this?
- Open it.

1793
02:12:58,956 --> 02:13:01,618
- Really?
- Yeah.

1794
02:13:02,659 --> 02:13:04,126
Really?

1795
02:13:04,795 --> 02:13:06,319
Yeah.

1796
02:13:06,496 --> 02:13:10,057
And they say
that this little speck...

1797
02:13:10,234 --> 02:13:12,429
...is a penis.

1798
02:13:15,706 --> 02:13:17,571
It's a boy.

1799
02:13:17,741 --> 02:13:20,539
Yeah, well,
one usually follows the other.

1800
02:13:22,045 --> 02:13:24,036
Can you still...?

1801
02:14:14,598 --> 02:14:16,589
I hope I won't have to remind you...

1802
02:14:16,767 --> 02:14:20,965
...that if you don't find this cheese-eating
rat bastard in your department...

1803
02:14:21,138 --> 02:14:24,801
...you can assume it won't be me
who pays for it.

1804
02:14:24,975 --> 02:14:27,808
Now, why would you
have to remind me of that?

1805
02:14:27,978 --> 02:14:33,280
Would l...? Would I be any good at what
I do if I didn't fucking already know that?

1806
02:14:33,450 --> 02:14:36,647
Frank, you gotta trust me.
I can get the rat.

1807
02:14:36,820 --> 02:14:39,186
You just gotta let me do it
my way, Frank.

1808
02:14:39,356 --> 02:14:42,757
Just let me do it.
Let me do what I do.

1809
02:14:42,926 --> 02:14:46,794
Hey, it fucking involves lying and
I'm pretty fucking good at that. Right?

1810
02:14:50,467 --> 02:14:52,025
What?

1811
02:14:55,639 --> 02:14:57,129
What?

1812
02:14:59,443 --> 02:15:01,741
- We got a cop in my crew.
- Yeah, I know.

1813
02:15:01,912 --> 02:15:05,871
- I'm kind of getting that feeling too.
- He's one of yours. Inside.

1814
02:15:06,049 --> 02:15:07,380
- You seen anything?
- Frank.

1815
02:15:07,551 --> 02:15:11,146
I got no access to Queenars undercover
files. He and Dignam run the snitches.

1816
02:15:11,321 --> 02:15:15,883
- I'm doing my...
- You know what, I thought I was the liar.

1817
02:15:16,059 --> 02:15:18,994
Hey, I can explain that!

1818
02:15:24,167 --> 02:15:26,192
Costello recorded everything.

1819
02:15:26,370 --> 02:15:30,932
He put all the tapes in a box and kept them
with his lawyer. That was his insurance.

1820
02:15:31,108 --> 02:15:32,598
His lawyer came to me.

1821
02:15:32,776 --> 02:15:34,539
Imagine that, you rat fuck.

1822
02:15:34,711 --> 02:15:36,702
Costello trusted me more than anyone.

1823
02:15:37,381 --> 02:15:40,578
Sound quality good enough?
Because I was a little worried.

1824
02:15:41,084 --> 02:15:43,678
- What do you want?
- I told you I want my identity back...

1825
02:15:43,854 --> 02:15:45,879
...you two-faced faggot.

1826
02:15:46,189 --> 02:15:50,023
- All right, where are you?
- Three o'clock. Where Queenan died.

1827
02:15:50,193 --> 02:15:52,127
You keep your cell on.

1828
02:16:04,241 --> 02:16:06,004
Open the door.

1829
02:16:10,013 --> 02:16:14,006
Open... Didrt we already talk about this?

1830
02:16:15,185 --> 02:16:17,346
This is my job.

1831
02:16:42,612 --> 02:16:44,603
- Freeze! Get your fucking hands up!
- Hey!

1832
02:16:44,781 --> 02:16:46,305
Put the fucking gun down!

1833
02:16:46,483 --> 02:16:49,714
Put the gun down, all right?
I came here to talk some sense into you.

1834
02:16:49,886 --> 02:16:51,444
- Hands!
- Just act professional.

1835
02:16:51,621 --> 02:16:53,646
- I can get you your money.
- What did you say?

1836
02:16:53,824 --> 02:16:57,419
- I can get you your money.
- You didn't come here to talk, all right?

1837
02:16:57,594 --> 02:17:00,563
- You came here to get arrested.
- You got fucking tapes? Of what?

1838
02:17:00,730 --> 02:17:04,222
Costello was my informant.
I was a rat? Fuck you! Prove it.

1839
02:17:04,401 --> 02:17:06,392
He was working for me.
He was my informant.

1840
02:17:06,570 --> 02:17:08,435
Shut your fucking mouth.
Come on, get up!

1841
02:17:08,605 --> 02:17:11,005
What is this, a citizers arrest?
Blow me, all right?

1842
02:17:11,174 --> 02:17:14,007
Only one of us is a cop here, Bill.
You understand that, Bill?

1843
02:17:14,177 --> 02:17:16,077
- No one knows you.
- Shut the fuck up!

1844
02:17:16,246 --> 02:17:19,511
I'm a sergeant in the Massachusetts
State Police. Who the fuck are you?

1845
02:17:19,683 --> 02:17:22,811
- I erased you!
- You erased me, huh?

1846
02:17:22,986 --> 02:17:25,648
Yeah, go ahead, shoot a cop, Einstein.
Watch what happens.

1847
02:17:25,822 --> 02:17:28,290
This bullet would
go right through your fucking head!

1848
02:17:28,458 --> 02:17:31,154
- Watch what happens!
- What, so you can get the parade, huh?

1849
02:17:31,328 --> 02:17:35,788
The bagpipes and bullshit? Fuck you!
Fuck you, I'm fucking arresting you!

1850
02:17:35,966 --> 02:17:38,730
- That's the stupidest thing you could do.
- Shut the fuck up!

1851
02:17:41,471 --> 02:17:43,701
I could give a fuck
if the charges don't stick.

1852
02:17:43,874 --> 02:17:45,569
I'm still fucking arresting you.

1853
02:17:46,009 --> 02:17:47,909
Get up.

1854
02:17:49,079 --> 02:17:52,105
Drop your weapon and step away
from Sergeant Sullivan.

1855
02:17:52,282 --> 02:17:54,807
I called you. You specifically. Look:

1856
02:17:54,985 --> 02:17:58,352
You know who I am. I'm not gonna shoot.
I told you to meet me downstairs.

1857
02:17:58,522 --> 02:18:01,491
Put your weapon on the deck
and step away from Sergeant Sullivan!

1858
02:18:01,658 --> 02:18:03,785
Where's Dignam?
I told you to bring Dignam!

1859
02:18:03,960 --> 02:18:06,190
Shoot this motherfucker!
Would you fucking shoot!

1860
02:18:06,363 --> 02:18:10,060
- Drop your weapon. We'll discuss it.
- Look, he's Costello's rat, all right?

1861
02:18:10,233 --> 02:18:14,897
I got boxes of tapes! Evidence!
Other documents proving it!

1862
02:18:17,307 --> 02:18:19,241
Maybe you do.

1863
02:18:19,409 --> 02:18:21,536
But right now I need you
to drop the weapon!

1864
02:18:21,711 --> 02:18:24,680
I have evidence cold-linking
this prick to Costello, all right?

1865
02:18:24,848 --> 02:18:27,817
- Would you shoot this fucking prick!
- You know who I am.

1866
02:18:27,984 --> 02:18:30,077
- You know who I am.
- Shoot this fucking prick.

1867
02:18:30,253 --> 02:18:32,448
I'm taking him downstairs now.

1868
02:18:35,759 --> 02:18:37,590
You know who I am.

1869
02:19:02,719 --> 02:19:04,584
Shut up.

1870
02:19:05,622 --> 02:19:08,648
I can't wait to see you explain this
to a Suffolk County jury...

1871
02:19:08,825 --> 02:19:10,019
...you fucking cocksucker.

1872
02:19:10,193 --> 02:19:12,718
This is gonna be fucking fun.

1873
02:19:23,873 --> 02:19:26,171
Just fucking kill me.

1874
02:19:27,777 --> 02:19:29,938
Just fucking kill me.

1875
02:19:32,215 --> 02:19:34,274
I am killing you.

1876
02:20:10,487 --> 02:20:13,217
Did you think you were the only one
he had on the inside?

1877
02:20:13,456 --> 02:20:15,754
Costello was gonna sell us to the FBI.

1878
02:20:15,925 --> 02:20:17,620
It's you and me now, you understand?

1879
02:20:17,794 --> 02:20:20,661
We gotta take care of each other,
you understand?

1880
02:20:34,277 --> 02:20:35,869
Give me that.

1881
02:20:51,294 --> 02:20:54,661
Right. Slow. March.

1882
02:21:02,872 --> 02:21:05,067
I attempted to subdue Trooper Barrigan...

1883
02:21:05,241 --> 02:21:09,769
...at which time he drew down on me,
and I was able to squeeze off one shot...

1884
02:21:09,946 --> 02:21:12,107
...and strike him in the head.

1885
02:21:12,282 --> 02:21:14,716
At that time I immediately
checked the vitals...

1886
02:21:14,884 --> 02:21:17,079
...on both
Troopers Brown and Costigan...

1887
02:21:17,253 --> 02:21:20,416
...and discovered that they had expired.

1888
02:21:23,593 --> 02:21:25,857
I just wanna go on record.

1889
02:21:26,596 --> 02:21:30,555
I'm recommending William Costigan
for the Medal of Merit.

1890
02:21:41,544 --> 02:21:43,876
- Eternal rest grant unto him, O Lord.
- Ready?

1891
02:21:44,047 --> 02:21:46,948
- And let perpetual light shine upon him.
- Fold.

1892
02:21:47,117 --> 02:21:49,915
May he rest in peace. Amen.

1893
02:21:50,086 --> 02:21:52,418
May his soul and the souls...

1894
02:21:52,589 --> 02:21:57,424
...of all the faithful departed,
through the mercy of God, rest in peace.

1895
02:21:57,594 --> 02:21:59,186
Amen.

1896
02:22:28,625 --> 02:22:30,855
Detail. Half left. Face.

1897
02:22:32,228 --> 02:22:34,219
Prepare to fire.

1898
02:22:34,464 --> 02:22:36,091
Fire.

1899
02:22:36,266 --> 02:22:38,757
Prepare to fire. Fire.

1900
02:22:39,669 --> 02:22:42,695
Prepare to fire. Fire.

1901
02:22:43,139 --> 02:22:46,438
Detail. Half right. Face.

1902
02:22:59,856 --> 02:23:02,222
I'll catch up with you guys.

1903
02:23:09,499 --> 02:23:11,330
What about the baby?

1904
02:23:29,052 --> 02:23:30,679
Hi, pup.

1905
02:24:02,218 --> 02:24:03,845
Okay.
