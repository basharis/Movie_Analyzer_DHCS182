00:33:04,882 --> 00:33:06,851
Who tell you about that professor thing?

538
00:33:06,851 --> 00:33:07,118
-Tea

539
00:33:07,118 --> 00:33:10,986
- Serve it to the fancy dress
and ask him to be quite...

540
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:16,227
- To whom?
- That duplicate of Bapu

541
00:33:16,227 --> 00:33:17,251
Where?

542
00:33:17,528 --> 00:33:18,654
There you can't see him

543
00:33:19,397 --> 00:33:20,796
Everyone crazy come over here

544
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:29,104
Who are you?

545
00:33:31,409 --> 00:33:34,173
You can call me Bapu

546
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:37,872
Don't touch me

547
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:42,787
Don't be afraid, l never
harm anybody till that day

548
00:33:42,787 --> 00:33:44,948
Boss, here is some problem

549
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:48,092
Are you not a soul?

550
00:33:48,092 --> 00:33:50,728
You can call me spirit instead of Soul

551
00:33:50,728 --> 00:33:54,892
- l'm unable to understand Baap (Father)
- Not Baap (Father), lt's Bapu (Gandhi)

552
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:57,698
You love to much with Janvi

553
00:33:58,503 --> 00:34:00,232
You'll going to her home on Sunday

554
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:01,368
How can you know?

555
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,303
- Hari Ram
- Don't be afraid Son

556
00:34:04,742 --> 00:34:07,643
- l come to help you
- Hari Ram

557
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,405
l'll leave because you're afraid

558
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,575
Whenever you need me call me
from the depth of your heart

559
00:34:14,952 --> 00:34:17,182

- Hari Ram

560
00:34:17,255 --> 00:34:18,222

561
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:19,513
There some one over there

562
00:34:23,428 --> 00:34:24,258
Who's it?

563
00:34:30,835 --> 00:34:32,234
lllusion, what is this?

564
00:34:32,637 --> 00:34:34,972
May times you hear voices due to the...

565
00:34:34,972 --> 00:34:37,875
...mental tiredness and
the chemical imbalance

566
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:42,175
See that kind of things that's
not real... that's illumination

567
00:34:42,447 --> 00:34:45,575
Mahatma Gandhi was there
l saw him over there

568
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:48,181
He's the soul of Bapu

569
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:52,824
lf there's a sprit then why
only you're able to see him

570
00:34:52,824 --> 00:34:56,194
lt depends upon the mood of the sprit

571
00:34:56,194 --> 00:34:59,230
From past three nights
you are researching...

572
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:01,899
...on Gandhi without
having rest and food

573
00:35:01,899 --> 00:35:06,671
That's why a restless
mind show you Gandhi Ji.

574
00:35:06,671 --> 00:35:09,231
What do you mean to say? that l'm Mad...

575
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:11,639
Don't worry, take this medicine

576

580
00:35:36,934 --> 00:35:38,836

592
00:36:12,603 --> 00:36:15,106
Bapu, would you like to have
cold rink, tea or anything?

593
00:36:15,106 --> 00:36:16,539

603
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:36,991
You mental hospital

604
00:36:37,461 --> 00:36:38,450
What're you saying?

605
00:36:39,964 --> 00:36:43,701
l know that there is no Bapu
and why are you spoiling his mind

606
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:44,793
are you making him mad?

607
00:36:45,169 --> 00:36:45,999
Give me the medicine

Because of you will power
he came out from the book

612
00:36:59,517 --> 00:37:00,950
Just like Aladdin's lamp

613

l went also along with you

614
00:37:04,288 --> 00:37:06,916
lt's Gandhi... that's
why he says hello to us

615
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:08,851
Don't take any kind of tension

616
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,062

...seeing the state of
our country he returns back

618
00:37:13,497 --> 00:37:14,828
Don't take any tension

619
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:16,428
Why to spoil while thinking?

620
00:37:17,602 --> 00:37:21,439
He said, he's going to help us

621
00:37:21,439 --> 00:37:23,236

624
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:56,607

and we ruined this country

691
00:42:04,488 --> 00:42:06,854
Son, that's not so bad

electric bulbs without electricity

696
00:42:16,233 --> 00:42:18,235
Roads with less
vehicles and more gullies

00:42:18,235 --> 00:42:20,760
You can't walk on the
footpath because of the shops

698
00:42:21,105 --> 00:42:23,073

lf the bed is available
then there is no one for care

702
00:42:29,446 --> 00:42:31,181
Nobody going to solve your complaints

703
00:42:31,181 --> 00:42:33,317
Ask the minister and
he recommends Bapu....

704
00:42:33,317 --> 00:42:34,716

705
00:42:34,919 --> 00:42:36,181

712
00:42:59,209 --> 00:43:00,506

01:00:38,801 --> 01:00:41,031
Ask you mother you born

Girls are very emotional

959
01:01:03,593 --> 01:01:08,197
Take her far away to the sunset and
ask her marry me or leave the boat

960
