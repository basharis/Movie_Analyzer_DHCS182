1
00:00:48,503 --> 00:00:50,631
<i>In our relations with other people,</i>

2
00:00:50,738 --> 00:00:54,799
<i>we mainly discuss and evaluate</i>

3
00:00:54,909 --> 00:00:57,537
<i>their character and behavior.</i>

4
00:00:58,546 --> 00:01:03,109
<i>That is why I have withdrawn</i>

5
00:01:03,217 --> 00:01:05,879
<i>from nearly all so-called relations.</i>

6
00:01:07,321 --> 00:01:12,055
<i>This has made my old age
rather lonely.</i>

7
00:01:13,628 --> 00:01:19,589
<i>My life has been full of hard work,
and I am grateful.</i>

8
00:01:19,701 --> 00:01:22,431
<i>It began as toil
for bread and butter</i>

9
00:01:22,538 --> 00:01:27,305
<i>and ended in a love for science.</i>

10
00:01:27,875 --> 00:01:33,609
<i>I have a son, also a doctor,
who lives in Lund.</i>

11
00:01:33,714 --> 00:01:38,708
<i>He has been married for many years.
They have no children.</i>

12
00:01:39,421 --> 00:01:45,381
<i>My old mother is still alive
and is very active, in spite of her age.</i>

13
00:01:50,565 --> 00:01:55,333
<i>My wife Karin
has been dead for many years.</i>

14
00:01:56,939 --> 00:01:58,735
Dinner is served, Professor Borg.

15
00:02:02,276 --> 00:02:04,369
Thank you.

16
00:02:04,478 --> 00:02:07,676
<i>I am lucky
in having a good housekeeper.</i>

17
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:13,284
<i>Perhaps I should add
that I am an old pedant,</i>

18
00:02:14,456 --> 00:02:17,618
<i>which at times
has been rather trying</i>

19
00:02:17,725 --> 00:02:22,686
<i>for myself and those around me.</i>

20
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,031
<i>My name is Isak Borg,</i>

21
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:31,404
<i>and I am 78.</i>

22
00:02:32,506 --> 00:02:37,968
<i>Tomorrow I shall receive
an honorary degree in Lund Cathedral.</i>

23
00:02:53,327 --> 00:02:56,627
WILD STRAWBERRIES

24
00:03:57,426 --> 00:04:00,657
<i>In the early hours ofJune 1 st,</i>

25
00:04:00,761 --> 00:04:04,857
<i>I had a weird
and very unpleasant dream.</i>

26
00:04:05,734 --> 00:04:09,225
<i>I dreamt that during
my morning walk</i>

27
00:04:09,337 --> 00:04:14,866
<i>I lost my way among empty streets</i>

28
00:04:14,975 --> 00:04:17,467
<i>with ruined houses.</i>

29
00:09:27,856 --> 00:09:28,948
Are you ill?

30
00:09:29,057 --> 00:09:32,788
Miss Agda, please prepare
some breakfast. I'm taking the car.

31
00:09:32,894 --> 00:09:37,125
Please, Professor! Go back to bed
and I'll bring you coffee at 9:00,

32
00:09:37,231 --> 00:09:40,530
and we'll leave at 10:00 as planned.

33
00:09:40,635 --> 00:09:42,967
Oh, well, I'll go without breakfast.

34
00:09:45,372 --> 00:09:47,068
And who will pack your tails?

35
00:09:48,308 --> 00:09:51,209
- I will do it myself.
- And what about me?

36
00:09:52,579 --> 00:09:58,212
You can come in the car or fly.
Please yourself.

37
00:09:58,318 --> 00:10:02,948
I've looked forward to seeing you get
your honorary degree.

38
00:10:03,058 --> 00:10:06,925
And we had arranged
everything so nicely,

39
00:10:07,028 --> 00:10:10,327
and now you're taking the car.

40
00:10:10,432 --> 00:10:13,059
The ceremony isn't until 5:00.

41
00:10:13,168 --> 00:10:16,694
If I leave at once, I've got 14 hours
before the ceremony.

42
00:10:16,804 --> 00:10:19,273
You'll ruin everything!

43
00:10:20,475 --> 00:10:24,001
What about your son who is expecting you
at the airport in Malmo?

44
00:10:24,111 --> 00:10:28,071
You can think up an explanation.

45
00:10:30,985 --> 00:10:34,112
If you go by car,
I won't come at all.

46
00:10:35,457 --> 00:10:37,549
Now listen, Miss Agda!

47
00:10:37,659 --> 00:10:42,687
Take the car, and you'll ruin
the greatest day of my life.

48
00:10:42,797 --> 00:10:45,231
We're not married, Miss Agda.

49
00:10:45,332 --> 00:10:49,895
I thank God for that every night.

50
00:10:50,004 --> 00:10:54,463
I've used my common sense for 74 years,
and it won't let me down now.

51
00:10:54,576 --> 00:10:57,067
Is that your last word?

52
00:10:57,178 --> 00:10:59,111
Yes.

53
00:11:01,281 --> 00:11:06,810
But I shall say plenty to myself
about selfish, crabby old men

54
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:12,483
who never think of those who have
served them faithfully for 40 years.

55
00:11:12,593 --> 00:11:15,586
Incredible that I have put up...

56
00:11:15,697 --> 00:11:20,566
with your bossing for so long.

57
00:11:20,668 --> 00:11:24,103
Just give the word,
and I'll leave tomorrow.

58
00:11:24,204 --> 00:11:29,643
I'm going by car anyway,
and you can do as you damn well please.

59
00:11:36,518 --> 00:11:42,478
I happen to be grown-up
and needn't take orders from you.

60
00:11:46,895 --> 00:11:50,023
No one can pack like you, Miss Agda.

61
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:51,928
Really?

62
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,467
Old sourpuss.

63
00:11:54,568 --> 00:11:56,502
Shall I boil you a couple of eggs?

64
00:11:56,603 --> 00:12:01,040
Yes, please, if you will be
so extremely kind.

65
00:12:06,146 --> 00:12:11,414
The faculty should have made me
honorary idiot.

66
00:12:15,557 --> 00:12:18,856
I'll calm the old girl down
with a present.

67
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,655
I hate resentful people.

68
00:12:21,763 --> 00:12:26,358
I wouldn't hurt a fly,
let alone Miss Agda.

69
00:12:27,434 --> 00:12:29,062
Toast?

70
00:12:29,169 --> 00:12:31,365
No, don't trouble yourself
on my account.

71
00:12:31,472 --> 00:12:34,372
What are you cross about?

72
00:12:40,114 --> 00:12:41,808
Don't you want a cup?

73
00:12:48,188 --> 00:12:49,520
Good morning, Uncle Isak.

74
00:12:49,624 --> 00:12:54,323
Well, well, why is my daughter-in-law
up at this hour?

75
00:12:54,428 --> 00:12:58,024
Who can sleep when you and Aunt Agda
are making such a row?

76
00:12:58,131 --> 00:13:00,429
There has been no row.

77
00:13:00,534 --> 00:13:02,230
No, not at all.

78
00:13:04,172 --> 00:13:06,163
You're taking the car to Lund?

79
00:13:06,274 --> 00:13:07,298
Yes.

80
00:13:07,408 --> 00:13:09,136
Can I come with you?

81
00:13:09,244 --> 00:13:10,768
You're going home?

82
00:13:10,877 --> 00:13:13,711
Yes, I want to go home.

83
00:13:13,814 --> 00:13:15,544
Home to Evald?

84
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:17,276
You don't need to ask why.

85
00:13:17,385 --> 00:13:20,047
I would take the train
if I could afford it.

86
00:13:20,154 --> 00:13:22,418
Of course you may ride with me.

87
00:13:22,523 --> 00:13:24,047
I'll be ready in ten minutes.

88
00:13:27,694 --> 00:13:29,252
Good heavens!

89
00:13:57,592 --> 00:14:01,995
Please don't smoke.
I can't stand cigarette smoke.

90
00:14:02,096 --> 00:14:03,495
I forgot.

91
00:14:03,597 --> 00:14:06,896
There should be a law
forbidding women to smoke.

92
00:14:08,101 --> 00:14:09,364
Beautiful weather.

93
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:13,270
Yes, but sultry.

94
00:14:14,042 --> 00:14:16,510
- I think we'll have a thunderstorm.
- So do I.

95
00:14:16,611 --> 00:14:18,237
No, give me a cigar anytime.

96
00:14:18,346 --> 00:14:21,645
That's stimulating and relaxing.
That's a vice for men.

97
00:14:21,749 --> 00:14:24,717
And what vices may a woman have?

98
00:14:24,818 --> 00:14:27,947
Weeping, giving birth
and speaking ill of her neighbors.

99
00:14:28,055 --> 00:14:30,819
How old are you really, Uncle Isak?

100
00:14:30,924 --> 00:14:32,289
Why do you ask?

101
00:14:32,393 --> 00:14:34,155
No reason. Why?

102
00:14:34,261 --> 00:14:37,163
I know why you asked.

103
00:14:37,265 --> 00:14:39,289
Oh, well.

104
00:14:41,635 --> 00:14:45,629
Don't pretend.
You don't like me. You never have.

105
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:48,174
I only know you
as a father-in-law.

106
00:14:48,275 --> 00:14:50,266
Why are you going home?

107
00:14:50,377 --> 00:14:52,278
On impulse. Nothing more.

108
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:54,644
Evald happens to be my son.

109
00:14:54,749 --> 00:14:56,182
So he is.

110
00:14:56,284 --> 00:14:59,741
Evald and I are very much alike.
We have our principles.

111
00:14:59,853 --> 00:15:01,718
<i>You don't need to tell me that.</i>

112
00:15:01,823 --> 00:15:03,222
Now, this loan, for instance.

113
00:15:03,323 --> 00:15:05,188
I know exactly
what you're going to say.

114
00:15:05,293 --> 00:15:07,989
He should have paid it back
when he became an associate professor.

115
00:15:08,096 --> 00:15:10,655
It's a matter of honor for him
to pay back 5,000 a year,

116
00:15:10,765 --> 00:15:12,096
and so on, and so on.

117
00:15:12,199 --> 00:15:14,134
A promise is a promise.

118
00:15:14,235 --> 00:15:17,068
For us, it means
that we never can be free together,

119
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:19,071
and that your son
works himself to death.

120
00:15:19,173 --> 00:15:21,539
You have your own income.

121
00:15:21,641 --> 00:15:23,506
Especially when one considers
the fact that you're filthy rich

122
00:15:23,611 --> 00:15:24,976
and don't need the money.

123
00:15:25,078 --> 00:15:30,675
A promise is a promise.
And I know Evald respects that.

124
00:15:31,718 --> 00:15:34,153
Perhaps.
But he also hates you.

125
00:15:44,531 --> 00:15:47,967
What do you have against me?

126
00:15:48,068 --> 00:15:49,764
Shall I be frank?

127
00:15:49,871 --> 00:15:51,202
Yes, I'm asking you.

128
00:15:52,506 --> 00:15:55,067
You're a selfish old man, Uncle Isak.

129
00:15:55,175 --> 00:15:59,635
You're utterly ruthless
and never listen to anyone but yourself.

130
00:16:00,715 --> 00:16:05,708
But you hide it all behind
your old-world manners and charm.

131
00:16:06,721 --> 00:16:12,216
Beneath your benevolent exterior,
you're as hard as nails.

132
00:16:13,126 --> 00:16:17,529
But you can't fool us
who have seen you at close quarters.

133
00:16:19,299 --> 00:16:22,063
Remember when
I came to you a month ago?

134
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:26,638
I had a stupid idea
that you might help Evald and me.

135
00:16:26,741 --> 00:16:29,208
So I asked to stay with you
for a week or two.

136
00:16:29,309 --> 00:16:31,778
Remember what you answered?

137
00:16:31,879 --> 00:16:34,904
I said I'd be delighted.

138
00:16:36,183 --> 00:16:39,620
Perhaps you've forgotten,
but you said,

139
00:16:40,688 --> 00:16:44,749
"Don't try to draw me
into your marital squabbles.

140
00:16:44,891 --> 00:16:46,587
I don't give a damn.

141
00:16:46,693 --> 00:16:48,684
You and Evald must make
the best of it."

142
00:16:48,795 --> 00:16:50,353
Did I say that?

143
00:16:50,465 --> 00:16:53,730
- Not only that.
- Oh, no.

144
00:16:53,834 --> 00:16:55,529
These were your very words:

145
00:16:56,437 --> 00:16:58,769
"I have no respect
for mental suffering,

146
00:16:58,872 --> 00:17:00,807
<i>so don't come lamenting to me.</i>

147
00:17:01,641 --> 00:17:06,341
If you need therapy,
you'd better see a shrink.

148
00:17:06,447 --> 00:17:10,042
Or why not a minister?
It's in fashion now."

149
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:11,880
Did I say that?

150
00:17:12,553 --> 00:17:15,579
Your judgments are very categorical,
Uncle Isak.

151
00:17:15,689 --> 00:17:19,091
I should hate to depend on you.

152
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:27,423
I have liked having you
about the house.

153
00:17:27,534 --> 00:17:29,229
Like a cat.

154
00:17:29,336 --> 00:17:31,703
A cat or a human being.

155
00:17:31,805 --> 00:17:37,038
You're a fine young woman,
and I'm sorry you dislike me.

156
00:17:37,143 --> 00:17:39,805
- I don't dislike you.
- Really?

157
00:17:39,913 --> 00:17:42,143
- I feel sorry for you.
- Sorry?

158
00:17:46,853 --> 00:17:50,880
I'd like to tell you about a dream
I had this morning.

159
00:17:50,992 --> 00:17:53,290
I'm not very interested in dreams.

160
00:17:53,393 --> 00:17:57,262
No. No, of course not.

161
00:18:10,444 --> 00:18:12,435
Where are you going now?

162
00:18:12,546 --> 00:18:15,107
I want to show you something.

163
00:18:48,082 --> 00:18:53,611
We lived here every summer
during the first 20 years of my life.

164
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:57,282
There were ten of us children.
Perhaps you knew that.

165
00:18:58,793 --> 00:19:00,283
Does anyone live here now?

166
00:19:00,393 --> 00:19:02,122
No, not this summer.

167
00:19:06,233 --> 00:19:08,928
I'll go swimming, if you don't mind.
We have plenty of time.

168
00:19:09,035 --> 00:19:10,560
Yes, by all means, do.

169
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:26,450
The place where
wild strawberries grow!

170
00:19:38,698 --> 00:19:42,533
<i>Perhaps I got a little sentimental.</i>

171
00:19:43,771 --> 00:19:46,501
<i>Perhaps I got a little tired</i>

172
00:19:46,607 --> 00:19:49,200
<i>and felt a bit sad.</i>

173
00:19:50,844 --> 00:19:56,147
<i>It's not impossible that I began
to think of this and that,</i>

174
00:19:56,249 --> 00:19:59,912
<i>associated with places
where I played as a child.</i>

175
00:20:01,255 --> 00:20:03,688
<i>I don't know how it happened,</i>

176
00:20:04,725 --> 00:20:07,216
<i>but the day's clear reality</i>

177
00:20:07,328 --> 00:20:12,493
<i>dissolved into the even clearer
images of memory</i>

178
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,091
<i>that appeared before my eyes</i>

179
00:20:15,201 --> 00:20:18,069
<i>with the strength
of a true stream of events.</i>

180
00:20:35,589 --> 00:20:36,351
Sara.

181
00:20:39,392 --> 00:20:41,088
Sara,

182
00:20:41,795 --> 00:20:44,161
it's your cousin Isak.

183
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:50,893
Well, I've become quite old,
of course, so I don't look the same.

184
00:20:51,971 --> 00:20:57,706
But you, you haven't changed at all.

185
00:21:03,617 --> 00:21:06,552
Good morning, sweet cousin.
What are you doing?

186
00:21:06,653 --> 00:21:08,849
Picking strawberries, silly.
Can't you see?

187
00:21:09,823 --> 00:21:12,451
And who shall be favored
with these delicious berries

188
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:16,325
picked in the early morn
by a lovely young woman?

189
00:21:16,429 --> 00:21:19,831
Nonsense. You know quite well
that it's Uncle Aron's name day today.

190
00:21:19,934 --> 00:21:22,300
I forgot to make a present.

191
00:21:22,402 --> 00:21:25,031
So he'll get a basket
of wild strawberries instead.

192
00:21:25,139 --> 00:21:26,298
I'll help you.

193
00:21:26,407 --> 00:21:29,934
You see, Sigbritt and Charlotta made
a tapestry and Angelica baked a cake,

194
00:21:30,044 --> 00:21:31,773
and Anna has painted
a really good picture,

195
00:21:31,879 --> 00:21:34,905
and Kristina and Birgitta
wrote a song that they'll sing to him.

196
00:21:35,015 --> 00:21:38,041
That's the best one.
Uncle Aron is stone-deaf.

197
00:21:38,151 --> 00:21:40,985
He'll be very pleased,
and you're stupid.

198
00:21:41,088 --> 00:21:43,522
And you have a darned cute nape.

199
00:21:45,993 --> 00:21:47,516
You know you shouldn't do that.

200
00:21:47,628 --> 00:21:50,119
<i>- Says who?
- I say.</i>

201
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:52,927
Besides, you're an unusually
insufferable young man

202
00:21:53,033 --> 00:21:54,694
who thinks he's really something.

203
00:21:54,802 --> 00:21:57,133
I'm your cousin,
and you're in love with me.

204
00:21:58,072 --> 00:21:59,300
With you!

205
00:22:00,841 --> 00:22:02,399
Come and be kissed on the lips.

206
00:22:03,611 --> 00:22:07,707
If you don't behave, I'll tell Isak
you're always trying to kiss me.

207
00:22:07,814 --> 00:22:11,342
Little Isak! I could beat him up
with one arm.

208
00:22:12,018 --> 00:22:14,816
You know quite well that Isak and I
are secretly engaged.

209
00:22:14,921 --> 00:22:18,619
So secretly, everyone knows it.

210
00:22:18,726 --> 00:22:21,752
It's not my fault that the twins
let the cat out of the bag.

211
00:22:21,861 --> 00:22:25,854
When is the wedding?
When is the wedding?

212
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:31,838
I don't know which of you four brothers
is the least conceited,

213
00:22:31,938 --> 00:22:34,304
but I think it's Isak.

214
00:22:34,408 --> 00:22:35,966
Isak is the nicest, anyway.

215
00:22:36,075 --> 00:22:38,737
And you're the horridest, nastiest,

216
00:22:38,845 --> 00:22:43,715
silliest, stupidest...
I can't find the words to describe you!

217
00:22:43,817 --> 00:22:46,911
Admit you've got
a weak spot for me.

218
00:22:47,021 --> 00:22:49,387
And you reek of cigars.

219
00:22:49,489 --> 00:22:51,253
It's a nice manly smell.

220
00:22:53,259 --> 00:22:57,286
<i>And the twins,
who know most things,</i>

221
00:22:57,398 --> 00:23:02,233
say you've been up to no good
with that Berglund girl.

222
00:23:02,335 --> 00:23:07,706
She's not a nice girl, the twins say.
And I agree.

223
00:23:07,807 --> 00:23:11,175
How pretty you are
when you blush.

224
00:23:11,277 --> 00:23:14,543
<i>You must kiss me.
I can't bear it any longer.</i>

225
00:23:14,648 --> 00:23:19,016
Now that I think of it,
I'm madly in love with you.

226
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:21,313
- You're just saying that.
- No.

227
00:23:23,623 --> 00:23:26,320
And the twins say

228
00:23:26,427 --> 00:23:29,554
<i>that you're mad about girls.</i>

229
00:23:29,763 --> 00:23:31,390
Is that true?

230
00:23:41,207 --> 00:23:43,835
Oh, look what you've done!

231
00:23:44,978 --> 00:23:49,210
And what will Isak say,
who really loves me?

232
00:23:50,383 --> 00:23:54,878
I'm so sad!
You've hurt me so!

233
00:23:56,556 --> 00:23:58,990
You've made
a bad woman of me.

234
00:23:59,092 --> 00:24:01,118
<i>At any rate, nearly.</i>

235
00:24:01,227 --> 00:24:04,788
I never want to see you again,
at least not before brunch.

236
00:24:05,232 --> 00:24:08,724
I have to hurry.
Help me pick up the strawberries.

237
00:24:09,669 --> 00:24:12,400
Oh, and now I've got
a stain on my apron!

238
00:24:41,802 --> 00:24:45,362
Where's Isak?

239
00:24:46,073 --> 00:24:50,873
Out fishing with Papa,
and they can't hear the gong.

240
00:24:50,977 --> 00:24:56,938
Anyway, Papa said
not to wait with brunch.

241
00:25:46,833 --> 00:25:49,028
In Jesus' name
we take our seat.

242
00:25:49,136 --> 00:25:52,572
Bless, O Lord,
this food we eat. Amen.

243
00:26:01,415 --> 00:26:04,543
Benjamin, go and wash
your hands at once.

244
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:07,552
How old do you have to be
to learn cleanliness?

245
00:26:07,653 --> 00:26:09,178
<i>I have.</i>

246
00:26:10,024 --> 00:26:13,720
Sigbritt, pass Angelica the porridge.

247
00:26:13,826 --> 00:26:17,194
Your fingernails are filthy.

248
00:26:18,165 --> 00:26:19,563
Hagbart, pass the bread.

249
00:26:21,601 --> 00:26:24,729
Don't take so much butter.

250
00:26:24,838 --> 00:26:28,831
Charlotta, the salt is lumpy.
You let it get damp.

251
00:26:28,941 --> 00:26:31,034
How often have I told you
not to let it sit out?

252
00:26:31,144 --> 00:26:34,409
<i>It's paint under my nails.</i>

253
00:26:34,515 --> 00:26:36,312
Who gathered
the wild strawberries for me?

254
00:26:36,417 --> 00:26:38,908
- I did.
- What?

255
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:44,083
Speak up, dear.
Uncle Aron can't hear.

256
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:47,024
I did!

257
00:26:47,127 --> 00:26:50,755
Fancy your remembering
my name day.

258
00:26:50,863 --> 00:26:53,093
How kind of you.

259
00:26:53,867 --> 00:26:58,099
Couldn't Uncle have a drink
to celebrate?

260
00:26:58,205 --> 00:27:00,900
Never when Papa is not at home.

261
00:27:01,675 --> 00:27:05,007
Uncle has already had three drinks.

262
00:27:05,111 --> 00:27:09,014
We saw him when we went out
to bathe at 8:00.

263
00:27:09,115 --> 00:27:11,413
So you've picked berries too.
Thank you.

264
00:27:11,517 --> 00:27:14,315
Twins, speak when spoken to.

265
00:27:15,922 --> 00:27:19,380
And as you didn't make your beds,
you can dry the silver.

266
00:27:20,794 --> 00:27:23,627
You will do as Auntie says.

267
00:27:23,729 --> 00:27:26,426
Benjamin, don't bite your nails.

268
00:27:26,533 --> 00:27:30,060
Anna, what are you doing?
Remember you're not a little girl anymore.

269
00:27:30,169 --> 00:27:32,070
I want to give Uncle my picture.

270
00:27:32,171 --> 00:27:34,936
Please, Auntie, can't we give him
our presents now?

271
00:27:35,042 --> 00:27:36,804
- Where is your present?
- Under the table.

272
00:27:36,909 --> 00:27:38,604
No, after we've eaten.

273
00:27:39,912 --> 00:27:44,646
A very advanced work of art:
Fritjof and Ingeborg.

274
00:27:44,751 --> 00:27:48,619
You can't tell which is Fritjof!

275
00:27:48,721 --> 00:27:53,988
What were Sara and Sigfrid doing
in the wild strawberry patch?

276
00:27:54,093 --> 00:27:56,960
We saw you! We saw you!

277
00:27:57,063 --> 00:27:59,726
The twins ought to be muzzled.

278
00:27:59,832 --> 00:28:01,926
The twins will be quiet
or leave the table.

279
00:28:02,034 --> 00:28:03,559
No freedom of speech, eh?

280
00:28:03,669 --> 00:28:05,570
Shut up, you brats.

281
00:28:06,239 --> 00:28:09,732
Sara's blushing! Sara's blushing!

282
00:28:10,776 --> 00:28:13,803
Sigfrid is blushing too!
Sigfrid and Sara! Sigfrid and Sara!

283
00:28:13,913 --> 00:28:15,778
Quiet, everybody!

284
00:28:19,253 --> 00:28:20,743
But Sara!

285
00:28:20,853 --> 00:28:22,822
They're lying! They're lying!

286
00:28:48,548 --> 00:28:54,509
Isak is so fine and good,

287
00:28:55,721 --> 00:28:59,919
so moral and sensitive.

288
00:29:00,026 --> 00:29:03,155
He wants us to read poetry

289
00:29:03,697 --> 00:29:05,995
and talk about the next life

290
00:29:06,099 --> 00:29:09,659
and play four-handed piano.

291
00:29:11,371 --> 00:29:14,772
And he only wants to kiss
in the dark,

292
00:29:16,008 --> 00:29:18,670
and he talks about sin.

293
00:29:18,778 --> 00:29:21,440
He's on such a terribly high level,

294
00:29:22,783 --> 00:29:25,274
and I feel so worthless.

295
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:30,516
<i>And I am worthless...
there's no denying it.</i>

296
00:29:34,026 --> 00:29:37,656
But sometimes it seems to me
that I'm a lot older than Isak,

297
00:29:37,764 --> 00:29:40,027
if you know what I mean.

298
00:29:40,132 --> 00:29:44,695
And then I think he's a child,
although we're the same age.

299
00:29:45,871 --> 00:29:51,207
And Sigfrid is so bold and exciting,
and I want to go home.

300
00:29:51,311 --> 00:29:53,471
I don't want to be here all summer

301
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:56,104
and be an object of ridicule
for the twins and all of you.

302
00:29:56,216 --> 00:29:58,207
I don't want to!

303
00:29:58,317 --> 00:30:00,547
I'll speak to Sigfrid.

304
00:30:00,653 --> 00:30:02,121
If he doesn't behave,

305
00:30:02,221 --> 00:30:04,656
I'll make sure he's made to study
during the summer holidays.

306
00:30:04,757 --> 00:30:06,419
Papa will fix that
as easy as anything.

307
00:30:06,525 --> 00:30:09,460
He too thinks Sigfrid is a
good-for-nothing and needs to work.

308
00:30:09,563 --> 00:30:13,054
Poor little Isak
who's so good to me.

309
00:30:14,368 --> 00:30:16,928
How unfair everything is.

310
00:30:18,572 --> 00:30:20,733
All will be well, you'll see.

311
00:30:20,841 --> 00:30:23,900
Listen, now they're singing
for Uncle Aron.

312
00:30:25,211 --> 00:30:30,514
How silly to write a song
for a deaf old man.

313
00:30:30,617 --> 00:30:32,244
How typical of the twins.

314
00:30:32,351 --> 00:30:37,255
<i>Flowers nod, grasses bow</i>

315
00:30:37,357 --> 00:30:42,817
<i>Around our lovely house</i>

316
00:30:42,928 --> 00:30:48,492
<i>We our Uncle Aron celebrate</i>

317
00:30:48,601 --> 00:30:50,570
<i>And with our song</i>

318
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:55,040
<i>Ornament his brow</i>

319
00:30:55,742 --> 00:30:59,438
Four cheers for Uncle Aron.

320
00:30:59,545 --> 00:31:03,641
Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah!

321
00:31:10,923 --> 00:31:13,255
I'll run down and meet
Isak and Uncle.

322
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,850
You do that.

323
00:31:15,762 --> 00:31:21,291
<i>I was overwhelmed by feelings
of emptiness and sadness,</i>

324
00:31:21,668 --> 00:31:25,364
<i>but was soon awakened
from my reveries</i>

325
00:31:26,505 --> 00:31:29,907
<i>by the voice of a young girl
asking me repeatedly about something.</i>

326
00:31:30,009 --> 00:31:31,841
Is this your house?

327
00:31:31,945 --> 00:31:34,037
No, it's not.

328
00:31:34,147 --> 00:31:36,478
You're lucky to be telling the truth.

329
00:31:36,582 --> 00:31:39,416
It's my dad who owns the whole
headland, including the house.

330
00:31:39,518 --> 00:31:43,420
I lived here once.
Two hundred years ago.

331
00:31:43,523 --> 00:31:45,821
Oh, yeah?

332
00:31:46,226 --> 00:31:49,457
- Is that your car up at the gate?
- Yes, that's my car.

333
00:31:49,563 --> 00:31:50,688
Looks antique.

334
00:31:50,796 --> 00:31:53,630
Yes, it's antique, like its owner.

335
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:58,769
So you have self-irony too.
That's fantastic.

336
00:31:58,871 --> 00:32:00,897
Where are you going?
I mean, in which direction?

337
00:32:01,006 --> 00:32:02,838
Well, I'm going to Lund.

338
00:32:02,942 --> 00:32:05,571
But that suits me perfectly.
You see, I'm on my way to Italy.

339
00:32:05,678 --> 00:32:08,409
I'm honored.

340
00:32:08,515 --> 00:32:10,846
My name's Sara.
Silly name, isn't it?

341
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:14,284
My name's Isak.
It's silly too.

342
00:32:14,388 --> 00:32:15,650
Weren't they married?

343
00:32:15,755 --> 00:32:20,591
No, unfortunately.
That was Abraham and Sara.

344
00:32:20,694 --> 00:32:21,820
Let's leave, then.

345
00:32:21,928 --> 00:32:25,762
I have another lady with me.
Here she comes.

346
00:32:25,865 --> 00:32:28,733
- Marianne, this is Sara.
- Hello.

347
00:32:28,834 --> 00:32:30,803
We're going to have company
as far as Lund.

348
00:32:30,903 --> 00:32:34,862
Sara's off to Italy, but she's promised
to ride a ways with us.

349
00:32:34,975 --> 00:32:38,138
Ironic again, but it suits you.

350
00:32:38,945 --> 00:32:40,435
Let's be off.

351
00:32:45,284 --> 00:32:48,448
Hey, guys, I've got a lift
almost to Italy.

352
00:32:48,554 --> 00:32:54,515
That's Anders and that's Viktor
and this is Father Isak.

353
00:32:56,929 --> 00:33:00,331
That peach you're gaping at
is Marianne.

354
00:33:03,969 --> 00:33:05,596
What a big bus.

355
00:33:05,705 --> 00:33:07,639
Yes, there's room for us all.

356
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:11,871
Put your luggage in the trunk,
if you don't mind.

357
00:33:27,294 --> 00:33:31,229
I must tell you, Isak,
that Anders and I are going steady.

358
00:33:31,331 --> 00:33:33,093
We're crazy about each other.

359
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:36,466
Viktor's the chaperone.
Daddy insisted.

360
00:33:37,803 --> 00:33:42,764
Viktor is in love with me too.

361
00:33:42,876 --> 00:33:45,743
It's a brilliant move of Daddy's.

362
00:33:45,845 --> 00:33:49,303
I may have to seduce Viktor
to get rid of him.

363
00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:54,850
I'd better tell you I'm a virgin.
That's why I'm so cheeky.

364
00:33:54,955 --> 00:33:56,979
And I smoke a pipe.

365
00:33:57,090 --> 00:34:02,187
Viktor says it's good for you.
He's crazy about anything healthy.

366
00:34:04,096 --> 00:34:07,032
I was once in love
with a woman called Sara.

367
00:34:07,132 --> 00:34:09,532
No! She was like me, wasn't she?

368
00:34:09,635 --> 00:34:12,537
She was, actually.

369
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:14,197
What happened to her?

370
00:34:14,307 --> 00:34:18,675
She married my brother Sigfrid
and had six children.

371
00:34:18,778 --> 00:34:22,713
She's 75 now
and quite a beautiful old lady.

372
00:34:22,816 --> 00:34:25,443
I can't think of anything worse
than growing old.

373
00:34:26,852 --> 00:34:31,084
<i>Oh, dear,
now I have put my foot in it.</i>

374
00:35:14,467 --> 00:35:15,934
Are you all right?

375
00:35:16,035 --> 00:35:19,061
I have no excuse.
It's all our fault.

376
00:35:19,171 --> 00:35:25,133
My wife was driving.
Are you all right?

377
00:35:25,912 --> 00:35:31,407
The murderers must introduce
themselves! My name's Alman.

378
00:35:32,052 --> 00:35:34,986
That's my wife Berit.
You can see she has been an actress.

379
00:35:35,088 --> 00:35:37,954
That's the complication
we were discussing when...

380
00:35:38,057 --> 00:35:40,218
Come here, Berit,
and say you're sorry.

381
00:35:40,327 --> 00:35:43,990
I'm so sorry.
It was all my fault.

382
00:35:44,097 --> 00:35:48,430
I was just going to hit my husband
when that curve appeared.

383
00:35:48,535 --> 00:35:53,700
God punishes some people at once,
eh, you Catholic?

384
00:35:53,807 --> 00:35:56,798
Let's get your car upright.

385
00:35:56,910 --> 00:35:59,673
- Oh, never mind us. Please.
- Shut up, Sten.

386
00:35:59,778 --> 00:36:04,238
<i>Some people are unselfish,
though you don't think so.</i>

387
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:11,086
My wife is a little nervous.
We've had a shock.

388
00:36:12,925 --> 00:36:17,760
Just look at him measuring
his strength with the youngsters,

389
00:36:17,863 --> 00:36:23,631
straining his flabby muscles
to show off in front of that cute girl.

390
00:36:29,376 --> 00:36:32,675
Darling, you might have a stroke.

391
00:36:35,414 --> 00:36:37,780
My wife likes ridiculing me.

392
00:36:37,883 --> 00:36:40,785
I let her.
It's psychotherapy.

393
00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:49,046
I never know whether my wife
is really crying or just playacting.

394
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:52,057
I'll be damned if it isn't real.

395
00:37:54,894 --> 00:37:57,727
It happens when you catch
a glimpse of death.

396
00:37:57,831 --> 00:37:59,856
Can't you shut up?

397
00:37:59,965 --> 00:38:02,695
<i>My wife can really live a part.</i>

398
00:38:03,535 --> 00:38:07,028
For two years,
she made me think she had cancer

399
00:38:07,139 --> 00:38:10,700
and plagued us
with every possible symptom,

400
00:38:10,809 --> 00:38:13,642
even though the doctors
could find nothing wrong with her.

401
00:38:13,747 --> 00:38:19,514
Eventually we believed her
more than the doctors!

402
00:38:19,619 --> 00:38:21,814
It's natural that you're upset,

403
00:38:21,921 --> 00:38:24,354
but why not leave your wife
in peace for a while?

404
00:38:24,456 --> 00:38:26,822
A woman has a right
to her tears, eh?

405
00:38:26,925 --> 00:38:30,053
Don't get in the way
of a woman's tears.

406
00:38:31,497 --> 00:38:36,197
You are beautiful,
but old Berit's a bit past her prime.

407
00:38:36,302 --> 00:38:37,997
<i>So you can afford to defend her.</i>

408
00:38:38,104 --> 00:38:41,561
I sympathize with her.
For several reasons.

409
00:38:41,673 --> 00:38:43,800
Very sarcastic!

410
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:46,309
Yet you don't seem
in the least hysterical.

411
00:38:47,079 --> 00:38:50,481
But little Berit is.

412
00:38:50,849 --> 00:38:53,044
Do you know
what that means for me?

413
00:38:53,153 --> 00:38:54,950
I gather you're a Catholic.

414
00:38:55,053 --> 00:38:57,488
Quite right.
That's how I stand it.

415
00:38:57,590 --> 00:38:59,921
We ridicule each other.

416
00:39:00,026 --> 00:39:02,289
She has her hysteria.
I have my Catholicism.

417
00:39:02,394 --> 00:39:05,626
So, you see,
we need each other.

418
00:39:05,731 --> 00:39:08,825
It's only egoism
that we haven't killed each other.

419
00:39:19,111 --> 00:39:21,137
There it came.

420
00:39:21,247 --> 00:39:24,477
That's what is called syncopes,
isn't it?

421
00:39:26,852 --> 00:39:29,151
Very funny.

422
00:39:32,624 --> 00:39:36,686
If I'd had a stopwatch,
I could have timed the explosion.

423
00:39:36,796 --> 00:39:39,959
Shut up! Shut up!

424
00:39:45,537 --> 00:39:48,735
This may be too blunt,

425
00:39:49,843 --> 00:39:53,573
but for the children's sake,
will you please get out.

426
00:40:03,122 --> 00:40:06,113
Forgive us, if you can.

427
00:40:36,622 --> 00:40:40,218
<i>It was with mixed feelings
I saw this region again.</i>

428
00:40:40,827 --> 00:40:43,557
<i>I had my first practice here,</i>

429
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:48,293
<i>and my old mother lives nearby.</i>

430
00:40:58,644 --> 00:41:00,738
Hello there, Doctor.

431
00:41:02,148 --> 00:41:04,479
So you're in these parts again,
Doctor?

432
00:41:04,584 --> 00:41:07,677
Shall I fill it up?
Pass me the key to the hood.

433
00:41:10,490 --> 00:41:12,981
Eva! Come here a moment!

434
00:41:15,061 --> 00:41:18,519
It's Dr. Borg in person.

435
00:41:19,398 --> 00:41:23,494
Mom and Dad and the whole countryside
still talk about him.

436
00:41:23,602 --> 00:41:25,832
The world's best doctor.

437
00:41:27,407 --> 00:41:31,104
Let's call the baby after him.

438
00:41:31,209 --> 00:41:34,543
Isak Akerman... not a bad name
for a prime minister.

439
00:41:34,646 --> 00:41:36,615
Suppose it's a girl.

440
00:41:36,715 --> 00:41:39,707
We only have boys.

441
00:41:46,092 --> 00:41:49,084
And how's your father these days?

442
00:41:49,195 --> 00:41:53,153
Oh, Dad's getting a bit decrepit.

443
00:41:53,265 --> 00:41:56,030
But Mom's as lively as a cricket.

444
00:41:57,202 --> 00:41:59,568
<i>And you're going to see
your mother, Doctor?</i>

445
00:42:00,706 --> 00:42:04,608
She's amazing.
She must be at least 95.

446
00:42:04,711 --> 00:42:07,202
- Ninety-six.
- Imagine that.

447
00:42:09,381 --> 00:42:10,974
What do I owe you?

448
00:42:11,084 --> 00:42:14,247
- This is on Eva and me!
- Absolutely not!

449
00:42:14,354 --> 00:42:18,222
Don't insult us, Doctor.
We can do the proper thing too!

450
00:42:18,323 --> 00:42:22,885
Why should you pay
for my gasoline?

451
00:42:22,996 --> 00:42:26,762
<i>There are things
that can't be paid back...</i>

452
00:42:26,898 --> 00:42:28,526
not even with gas.

453
00:42:28,633 --> 00:42:31,102
We haven't forgotten.

454
00:42:31,204 --> 00:42:34,970
Ask anyone around here.

455
00:42:35,073 --> 00:42:38,043
They all remember your kindness.

456
00:42:40,113 --> 00:42:43,343
Maybe I should have stayed here.

457
00:42:43,448 --> 00:42:45,041
What do you mean?

458
00:42:48,287 --> 00:42:51,050
You said you should have stayed.

459
00:42:51,157 --> 00:42:53,352
Did I?

460
00:42:53,459 --> 00:42:56,950
Well, thanks anyway.

461
00:42:58,164 --> 00:43:02,793
Let me know when the new son arrives,
and I'll be the godfather.

462
00:43:02,901 --> 00:43:04,802
You know where to find me.

463
00:43:26,025 --> 00:43:30,927
<i>During lunch I was in good spirits</i>

464
00:43:31,030 --> 00:43:35,490
<i>and told the young people about
my years as district medical officer.</i>

465
00:43:35,601 --> 00:43:38,229
<i>My stories were quite a success,</i>

466
00:43:38,336 --> 00:43:41,602
<i>and I don't think they laughed
merely out of courtesy.</i>

467
00:43:42,175 --> 00:43:46,635
<i>I had wine with the lunch,
and then port with the coffee.</i>

468
00:43:50,816 --> 00:43:56,414
Ah, when creation shows
so much beauty,

469
00:43:57,289 --> 00:44:00,588
how radiant must be its source!

470
00:44:00,693 --> 00:44:02,854
He is going to be a minister,
and Viktor a doctor.

471
00:44:02,961 --> 00:44:05,122
Reciting poetry
is against our agreement

472
00:44:05,231 --> 00:44:09,599
not to discuss God
or science on this trip.

473
00:44:09,702 --> 00:44:10,930
It was beautiful!

474
00:44:11,037 --> 00:44:15,439
How can anyone today
study to become a minister!

475
00:44:15,541 --> 00:44:19,943
Your rationalism is as dry as dust.

476
00:44:20,046 --> 00:44:21,775
I say that modern man...

477
00:44:21,881 --> 00:44:23,644
I say that...

478
00:44:23,749 --> 00:44:28,914
believes only in himself

479
00:44:29,021 --> 00:44:30,648
and his biological death.

480
00:44:30,756 --> 00:44:33,519
Modern man is a figment
of your imagination.

481
00:44:33,626 --> 00:44:37,220
Man regards death with horror.

482
00:44:37,329 --> 00:44:41,595
Religion for the people.
Opium for the aching limb.

483
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:43,258
<i>How sweet they both are!</i>

484
00:44:43,369 --> 00:44:45,394
I always agree with the one
I spoke with last.

485
00:44:45,505 --> 00:44:48,405
Once you believed in Santa Claus...
now in God.

486
00:44:48,508 --> 00:44:51,965
You never had any imagination!

487
00:44:52,077 --> 00:44:54,568
What do you say, Professor?

488
00:44:54,680 --> 00:45:00,481
Whatever I said
would be met with tolerant irony,

489
00:45:00,586 --> 00:45:02,110
so I'll say nothing.

490
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:04,121
I'm sure they'll be disappointed.

491
00:45:04,222 --> 00:45:07,919
No, Sara. Very, very happy.

492
00:45:09,996 --> 00:45:13,488
"Where is the friend I seek

493
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:19,298
at break of day?

494
00:45:19,405 --> 00:45:23,363
When night falls, when..."

495
00:45:23,476 --> 00:45:26,775
"When night falls,
I still have not found Him."

496
00:45:26,878 --> 00:45:30,644
"My burning heart
shows me His traces..."

497
00:45:30,749 --> 00:45:32,684
Are you religious, Professor?

498
00:45:34,887 --> 00:45:38,983
"I see His traces

499
00:45:39,090 --> 00:45:43,858
wherever flowers bloom.

500
00:45:49,001 --> 00:45:54,267
His love is mingled with every air."

501
00:45:55,207 --> 00:45:58,177
"His voice calls
in the summer wind."

502
00:45:58,276 --> 00:46:01,371
Not bad for a love poem.

503
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:06,546
I've gone all solemn again
for no reason.

504
00:46:07,787 --> 00:46:12,918
Well, I'm going to call on my mother.
I'll be back soon.

505
00:46:13,025 --> 00:46:15,720
- May I come?
- Of course.

506
00:46:27,439 --> 00:46:29,805
Here comes the thunder.

507
00:46:36,349 --> 00:46:40,785
I have just sent you a telegram

508
00:46:40,885 --> 00:46:43,945
on your great day.

509
00:46:44,222 --> 00:46:45,747
And now you're here.

510
00:46:45,858 --> 00:46:49,349
We all have our bright moments,
dear Mother.

511
00:46:51,863 --> 00:46:54,628
Is that your wife over there?

512
00:46:54,733 --> 00:46:57,793
I don't want to talk to her.

513
00:46:58,470 --> 00:47:00,871
She has done us too much harm.

514
00:47:00,972 --> 00:47:03,702
No, Mother dear.

515
00:47:03,809 --> 00:47:08,405
This is Evald's wife, Marianne.

516
00:47:08,514 --> 00:47:11,539
Well, let her come
and say hello to me.

517
00:47:13,852 --> 00:47:15,787
Good day, Mrs. Borg.

518
00:47:16,088 --> 00:47:19,421
And why are you
gadding about like this?

519
00:47:19,525 --> 00:47:21,515
I have been in Stockholm for a visit.

520
00:47:21,626 --> 00:47:25,756
Why aren't you with Evald
and the child?

521
00:47:25,865 --> 00:47:28,765
Evald and I have no children.

522
00:47:28,867 --> 00:47:33,965
These young people nowadays!
I bore ten children.

523
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:41,409
Will you please hand me
that big box over there.

524
00:47:43,448 --> 00:47:46,349
My mother lived in this house.

525
00:47:46,452 --> 00:47:50,081
Do you remember
coming to see her, Isak?

526
00:47:50,189 --> 00:47:52,053
Very well.

527
00:47:52,157 --> 00:47:56,184
Here are some of your toys.

528
00:47:56,294 --> 00:48:01,197
I have been trying to think
which of you owned what.

529
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:05,030
Ten children,
and all dead except Isak.

530
00:48:05,137 --> 00:48:07,264
Twenty grandchildren.

531
00:48:07,372 --> 00:48:10,307
Evald's the only one
who comes to see me.

532
00:48:10,409 --> 00:48:13,139
Don't get me wrong...
I'm not complaining.

533
00:48:14,012 --> 00:48:17,244
Fifteen great-grandchildren
whom I have never seen.

534
00:48:17,349 --> 00:48:23,084
I send presents
for all their birthdays.

535
00:48:23,189 --> 00:48:29,025
I get letters of thanks,
but nobody bothers to visit me

536
00:48:29,128 --> 00:48:32,655
unless they want to borrow money.

537
00:48:32,764 --> 00:48:35,927
Oh, I know I'm tiresome.

538
00:48:36,035 --> 00:48:38,559
Don't think that, Mother.

539
00:48:38,671 --> 00:48:40,798
And I've one more fault.

540
00:48:41,340 --> 00:48:43,307
I don't die.

541
00:48:43,409 --> 00:48:47,037
The inheritance
isn't being divided up

542
00:48:47,146 --> 00:48:50,171
the way these crafty young people
had planned.

543
00:48:51,349 --> 00:48:54,751
This was Sigbritt's doll.

544
00:48:55,019 --> 00:48:58,079
She got it when she turned eight.

545
00:48:58,256 --> 00:49:00,918
I made the dress myself.

546
00:49:01,026 --> 00:49:03,392
But she never cared for it

547
00:49:03,496 --> 00:49:05,430
so it went to Charlotta.

548
00:49:05,530 --> 00:49:09,092
She took care of it...
I remember it clearly.

549
00:49:10,869 --> 00:49:12,633
Do you see who that is?

550
00:49:12,738 --> 00:49:16,037
Sigfrid was three
and you were five.

551
00:49:16,742 --> 00:49:20,177
And myself.

552
00:49:20,278 --> 00:49:22,713
What a fright
one looked in those days.

553
00:49:23,749 --> 00:49:25,215
May I have it?

554
00:49:25,316 --> 00:49:27,842
By all means.
It's only rubbish.

555
00:49:28,854 --> 00:49:30,684
And here's a coloring book.

556
00:49:30,789 --> 00:49:36,421
I don't know whose it was.

557
00:49:36,528 --> 00:49:39,088
They've all put their names in it.

558
00:49:40,166 --> 00:49:42,133
Kristina has scrawled:

559
00:49:42,233 --> 00:49:47,193
"I love Papa more than
anything in the whole world."

560
00:49:48,441 --> 00:49:53,468
And Birgitta has put:
"I'm going to marry Papa."

561
00:49:54,479 --> 00:49:58,883
Isn't that funny?
I laughed when I saw it.

562
00:49:59,918 --> 00:50:04,048
Don't you think it's cold in here?

563
00:50:04,155 --> 00:50:06,784
No, not particularly.

564
00:50:06,892 --> 00:50:10,555
I have felt cold all my life.

565
00:50:10,662 --> 00:50:14,121
Mostly my stomach.
I wonder why.

566
00:50:14,233 --> 00:50:17,066
You have low blood pressure.

567
00:50:17,168 --> 00:50:22,037
Let us have some tea,
and we can sit and talk.

568
00:50:22,140 --> 00:50:25,303
No, thank you, Mother.
We won't disturb you any longer.

569
00:50:29,514 --> 00:50:32,483
Sigbritt's eldest boy
will soon be 50.

570
00:50:32,584 --> 00:50:35,678
I thought of giving him
Father's gold watch.

571
00:50:35,787 --> 00:50:39,689
It has no hands.
Does that matter?

572
00:50:49,635 --> 00:50:53,934
I remember when Sigbritt's boy
was a newborn.

573
00:50:54,039 --> 00:50:59,443
He used to lie in the lilac arbor
at the summer house.

574
00:50:59,544 --> 00:51:02,604
Now he's turning 50.

575
00:51:03,715 --> 00:51:09,211
And little cousin Sara used to
carry him around and sing to him.

576
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:12,084
She married Sigfrid,
that good-for-nothing.

577
00:51:13,057 --> 00:51:18,519
Well, you must go now,
or you'll be late for the ceremony.

578
00:51:18,631 --> 00:51:23,693
I am very glad you came,
and I hope to see you again.

579
00:51:23,802 --> 00:51:27,293
Give my love to Evald.
Good-bye.

580
00:51:53,999 --> 00:51:56,398
Where are Anders and Viktor?

581
00:51:56,501 --> 00:52:02,133
They started arguing about God,
and then they lost their tempers.

582
00:52:02,575 --> 00:52:05,702
And Anders tried
to twist Viktor's arm,

583
00:52:05,811 --> 00:52:09,747
and Viktor said that was
a lousy argument for God's existence.

584
00:52:09,847 --> 00:52:13,477
I said they could talk
about me instead.

585
00:52:13,586 --> 00:52:18,285
Then they told me to shut up
because I didn't understand the debate,

586
00:52:18,389 --> 00:52:19,856
so I left.

587
00:52:19,959 --> 00:52:24,088
They went up the hill to fight it out
because each insisted...

588
00:52:24,195 --> 00:52:27,131
the other had hurt
his innermost feelings.

589
00:52:27,231 --> 00:52:29,461
- Where are they now?
- Up there.

590
00:52:33,572 --> 00:52:35,198
I'll see to them.

591
00:52:35,307 --> 00:52:37,740
<i>Which one do you like best?</i>

592
00:52:38,110 --> 00:52:40,340
Which one do you like best?

593
00:52:40,445 --> 00:52:43,813
I don't know.
Anders is going to be a minister...

594
00:52:43,916 --> 00:52:45,941
He's a darling.

595
00:52:46,885 --> 00:52:48,910
But a minister's wife...

596
00:52:49,021 --> 00:52:51,990
Viktor's nice too.
In a different way.

597
00:52:52,090 --> 00:52:55,526
- Viktor will go far, of course.
- What do you mean?

598
00:52:55,628 --> 00:53:00,860
A doctor earns more money.
And ministers are out of date.

599
00:53:00,965 --> 00:53:04,662
Though he has got nice legs
and a sweet neck.

600
00:53:05,903 --> 00:53:07,838
<i>But how can anyone believe in God?</i>

601
00:53:21,486 --> 00:53:24,081
Well? Does God exist?

602
00:53:47,780 --> 00:53:53,218
<i>I dozed off,
but was haunted by vivid</i>

603
00:53:53,318 --> 00:53:58,914
<i>and humiliating dreams.</i>

604
00:53:59,858 --> 00:54:06,195
<i>There was something overpowering
in these dream images</i>

605
00:54:06,298 --> 00:54:12,236
<i>that bored relentlessly into my mind.</i>

606
00:54:22,947 --> 00:54:24,939
Have you looked in the mirror, Isak?

607
00:54:28,086 --> 00:54:30,077
Then I'll show you
what you look like.

608
00:54:32,090 --> 00:54:35,389
You're a worried old man
who's soon going to die,

609
00:54:35,494 --> 00:54:38,189
but I have all my life before me.

610
00:54:39,764 --> 00:54:42,198
That hurt your feelings, after all.

611
00:54:43,135 --> 00:54:46,400
No, it didn't hurt.

612
00:54:46,505 --> 00:54:51,602
Yes, it hurt
because you can't bear the truth.

613
00:54:52,644 --> 00:54:56,171
The truth is that
I've been too considerate.

614
00:54:56,782 --> 00:54:58,943
And so became unintentionally cruel.

615
00:55:02,086 --> 00:55:03,178
I understand.

616
00:55:03,287 --> 00:55:08,224
No, you don't understand.
We don't speak the same language.

617
00:55:09,461 --> 00:55:11,189
Look in the mirror again.

618
00:55:11,296 --> 00:55:13,320
No, don't turn away.

619
00:55:13,932 --> 00:55:15,490
I see.

620
00:55:16,101 --> 00:55:17,762
Listen to me.

621
00:55:18,970 --> 00:55:22,202
I'm going to marry
your brother Sigfrid.

622
00:55:23,041 --> 00:55:27,171
Love is almost a game for us.

623
00:55:28,881 --> 00:55:33,318
Look at your face now.
Try to smile!

624
00:55:34,986 --> 00:55:37,581
There! Now you're smiling.

625
00:55:39,691 --> 00:55:41,715
But it hurts so.

626
00:55:42,227 --> 00:55:47,164
As professor emeritus,
you ought to know why it hurts.

627
00:55:47,265 --> 00:55:48,823
But you don't know.

628
00:55:49,968 --> 00:55:53,903
You know so much,
and you don't know anything.

629
00:55:55,874 --> 00:55:57,501
I must go.

630
00:55:57,608 --> 00:56:01,135
I promised to keep an eye
on Sigbritt's baby.

631
00:56:29,874 --> 00:56:32,104
Poor little thing.

632
00:56:32,811 --> 00:56:35,575
Hush, baby. Sleep.

633
00:56:36,849 --> 00:56:38,646
Don't be afraid of the wind

634
00:56:39,718 --> 00:56:44,552
or the birds

635
00:56:45,423 --> 00:56:48,358
or the waves of the sea.

636
00:56:49,061 --> 00:56:52,394
I'm here with you,
holding you tight.

637
00:56:52,497 --> 00:56:55,021
Don't be afraid, little one.

638
00:56:56,401 --> 00:56:58,561
It will soon be day again.

639
00:56:59,604 --> 00:57:01,572
No one will hurt you.

640
00:57:01,673 --> 00:57:04,836
I am with you.
I am holding you.

641
01:00:12,898 --> 01:00:14,990
Please come in, Professor Borg.

642
01:01:33,311 --> 01:01:35,336
Have you brought
your examination book?

643
01:01:42,854 --> 01:01:46,483
Please identify the bacterial specimen
under the microscope.

644
01:01:57,936 --> 01:01:59,994
There must be something wrong.

645
01:02:04,242 --> 01:02:05,731
Not with the microscope.

646
01:02:05,843 --> 01:02:09,142
I can't see a thing.

647
01:02:10,182 --> 01:02:12,912
Please read this text.

648
01:02:27,831 --> 01:02:29,264
What does it mean?

649
01:02:31,001 --> 01:02:32,764
I don't know.

650
01:02:34,405 --> 01:02:35,497
Really?

651
01:02:35,606 --> 01:02:39,407
I'm a doctor, not a linguist.

652
01:02:40,477 --> 01:02:46,211
What you see on the blackboard
is a doctor's first duty.

653
01:02:47,352 --> 01:02:50,253
Don't you know what that is?

654
01:02:53,057 --> 01:02:54,854
Let me think.

655
01:02:54,959 --> 01:02:56,586
Take your time.

656
01:02:58,597 --> 01:03:02,727
A doctor's first duty...

657
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:04,930
A doctor's...

658
01:03:06,604 --> 01:03:08,037
I've forgotten.

659
01:03:08,139 --> 01:03:12,371
A doctor's first duty
is to ask for forgiveness.

660
01:03:13,077 --> 01:03:17,481
Of course! Now I remember!

661
01:03:29,193 --> 01:03:31,856
You have been accused of guilt.

662
01:03:35,032 --> 01:03:38,298
I'll make a note that you haven't
understood the charge.

663
01:03:41,472 --> 01:03:43,441
Is it serious?

664
01:03:44,175 --> 01:03:45,836
Unfortunately, Professor.

665
01:03:57,856 --> 01:03:59,517
I have a weak heart.

666
01:03:59,624 --> 01:04:01,887
I'm an old man.

667
01:04:01,992 --> 01:04:04,825
You must be lenient with me.
It's only fair.

668
01:04:05,262 --> 01:04:07,992
There's nothing about your heart
in my papers.

669
01:04:08,599 --> 01:04:09,999
Do you want to stop the examination?

670
01:04:10,101 --> 01:04:12,126
No, for God's sake, no!

671
01:04:19,644 --> 01:04:22,874
Please diagnose the patient.

672
01:04:36,727 --> 01:04:39,356
The patient is dead.

673
01:05:01,619 --> 01:05:03,814
What are you writing in my book?

674
01:05:03,921 --> 01:05:06,981
- My verdict.
- And that is?

675
01:05:07,425 --> 01:05:09,358
That you are incompetent.

676
01:05:12,764 --> 01:05:18,099
You are also accused of some minor
but still serious offenses.

677
01:05:18,736 --> 01:05:23,173
Callousness, selfishness,
ruthlessness.

678
01:05:24,008 --> 01:05:26,977
Your wife has made the charge.

679
01:05:27,077 --> 01:05:29,410
You'll be confronted with her.

680
01:05:29,514 --> 01:05:32,005
But my wife has been dead for years!

681
01:05:32,117 --> 01:05:33,981
Do you think I'm joking?

682
01:05:36,553 --> 01:05:38,715
Please come with me.

683
01:05:39,224 --> 01:05:41,316
You have no choice.

684
01:08:01,932 --> 01:08:04,925
Many forget a woman
who has been dead for 30 years.

685
01:08:05,602 --> 01:08:08,697
Some cherish
a sweet and fading picture,

686
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:14,805
but you can recall this scene
at any time.

687
01:08:15,646 --> 01:08:18,343
Tuesday, May 1 st, 1917.

688
01:08:19,617 --> 01:08:21,277
You stood on this very spot.

689
01:08:21,385 --> 01:08:25,822
And heard and saw what that man
and woman said and did.

690
01:08:40,838 --> 01:08:45,275
Now I'll go home and tell Isak.
I know just what he'll say.

691
01:08:45,375 --> 01:08:48,709
"My poor girl, I'm sorry for you."

692
01:08:50,581 --> 01:08:52,947
Just as if he were God.

693
01:08:54,585 --> 01:08:59,818
Then I'll weep and say,
"Do you really feel sorry for me?"

694
01:09:01,058 --> 01:09:05,495
He'll say, "Yes, very sorry."

695
01:09:06,097 --> 01:09:10,124
Then I'll weep even more
and ask him to forgive me.

696
01:09:10,233 --> 01:09:11,428
He'll say,

697
01:09:11,536 --> 01:09:16,838
"You mustn't beg my forgiveness.
There is nothing to forgive."

698
01:09:19,611 --> 01:09:22,340
But he doesn't mean
a word he says

699
01:09:24,314 --> 01:09:26,579
because he's cold as ice.

700
01:09:28,486 --> 01:09:31,182
And suddenly he gets very tender,

701
01:09:32,723 --> 01:09:35,214
and I scream at him that he's mad

702
01:09:36,995 --> 01:09:40,259
and that his hypocrisy makes me sick.

703
01:09:41,299 --> 01:09:44,325
Then he says
he'll get me a sedative

704
01:09:44,434 --> 01:09:47,631
and that he understands
everything quite well.

705
01:09:48,839 --> 01:09:51,000
And I tell him it's his fault
that I am as I am.

706
01:09:53,443 --> 01:09:57,573
<i>And he looks sad
and says it is his fault.</i>

707
01:09:59,483 --> 01:10:01,781
But he doesn't really care
about anything

708
01:10:02,452 --> 01:10:04,420
because he's so cold.

709
01:10:28,412 --> 01:10:29,879
Where is she?

710
01:10:29,981 --> 01:10:34,441
Gone. All are gone.

711
01:10:34,552 --> 01:10:38,487
Removed by an operation,
Professor.

712
01:10:39,122 --> 01:10:42,751
A surgical masterpiece.
No pain.

713
01:10:42,860 --> 01:10:44,794
Nothing that bleeds or trembles.

714
01:10:45,696 --> 01:10:47,857
How silent it is.

715
01:10:48,866 --> 01:10:51,357
A perfect achievement
in its way, Professor.

716
01:10:52,402 --> 01:10:54,200
And the punishment?

717
01:10:54,304 --> 01:10:57,968
I don't know.
The usual, I suppose.

718
01:10:58,076 --> 01:10:59,634
The usual?

719
01:10:59,744 --> 01:11:01,643
Loneliness.

720
01:11:01,745 --> 01:11:04,044
Loneliness?

721
01:11:04,147 --> 01:11:06,981
Precisely.

722
01:11:07,719 --> 01:11:09,812
Is there no mercy?

723
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:13,287
Don't ask me. I don't know.

724
01:11:33,510 --> 01:11:35,240
What's this?

725
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:38,946
The children wanted
to stretch their legs.

726
01:11:39,049 --> 01:11:41,745
But it's still raining.

727
01:11:41,853 --> 01:11:46,517
I told them about today
and they want to honor you.

728
01:11:47,991 --> 01:11:49,015
Slept well?

729
01:11:49,126 --> 01:11:54,894
Yes, but recently I've had
the weirdest dreams,

730
01:11:59,737 --> 01:12:04,071
as if I must tell myself something
I won't listen to when I'm awake.

731
01:12:04,174 --> 01:12:05,505
What's that?

732
01:12:06,878 --> 01:12:10,005
That I'm dead.
Although I'm alive.

733
01:12:10,881 --> 01:12:13,372
You and Evald are very alike.

734
01:12:14,251 --> 01:12:15,912
So you've said.

735
01:12:16,019 --> 01:12:18,250
He said the same thing.

736
01:12:18,688 --> 01:12:20,714
About me?

737
01:12:20,825 --> 01:12:22,554
No. About himself.

738
01:12:22,660 --> 01:12:24,126
But he's only 38.

739
01:12:26,731 --> 01:12:29,222
May I tell you about it?

740
01:12:29,332 --> 01:12:33,268
Yes, I'd be grateful.

741
01:12:34,839 --> 01:12:39,207
A few months ago
I wanted to talk to Evald,

742
01:12:39,309 --> 01:12:41,402
so he drove me down to the sea.

743
01:12:41,512 --> 01:12:45,572
It was raining then too.
He sat where you sit now.

744
01:12:47,852 --> 01:12:52,220
Well, you've trapped me.
What do you want to say?

745
01:12:52,322 --> 01:12:54,553
Something unpleasant, of course.

746
01:12:55,927 --> 01:12:57,986
I wish I didn't have to.

747
01:12:58,094 --> 01:13:00,153
You have found someone else.

748
01:13:01,064 --> 01:13:02,896
Don't be childish.

749
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:07,595
You tell me in funereal tones
that you must talk to me,

750
01:13:07,705 --> 01:13:11,436
and then you find it
hard to begin.

751
01:13:11,541 --> 01:13:17,481
Come on, for heaven's sake!
Don't keep me on tenterhooks!

752
01:13:17,581 --> 01:13:19,412
I almost want to laugh now.

753
01:13:19,517 --> 01:13:21,416
Whatever do you think
I'm going to tell you?

754
01:13:21,518 --> 01:13:25,717
That I've killed someone,
or stolen the faculty funds?

755
01:13:25,822 --> 01:13:27,450
I'm going to have a baby.

756
01:13:30,327 --> 01:13:31,852
Are you sure?

757
01:13:31,963 --> 01:13:34,362
The doctor told me yesterday.

758
01:13:34,464 --> 01:13:38,834
So that was the secret.

759
01:13:39,836 --> 01:13:44,137
I might as well tell you
that I intend to have this child.

760
01:13:45,343 --> 01:13:47,970
- You've made up your mind?
- Yes, I have.

761
01:14:04,461 --> 01:14:06,521
You know I don't want a child.

762
01:14:06,630 --> 01:14:09,064
You'll have to choose
between me and the child.

763
01:14:09,165 --> 01:14:12,226
- Poor Evald.
- Don't "poor Evald" me!

764
01:14:13,036 --> 01:14:16,528
It's absurd to bring children
into this world

765
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:19,508
and think they'll be better off
than we are.

766
01:14:19,610 --> 01:14:23,478
- That's just an excuse.
- Call it what you want.

767
01:14:23,580 --> 01:14:27,880
I was an unwanted child
in a hellish marriage.

768
01:14:27,985 --> 01:14:30,852
Is he even sure I'm his son?

769
01:14:30,955 --> 01:14:34,617
That's no excuse
for behaving like this.

770
01:14:34,724 --> 01:14:36,249
I must be at the hospital at 3:00.

771
01:14:36,360 --> 01:14:39,329
I have neither the time nor the desire
to discuss this any further.

772
01:14:41,398 --> 01:14:43,299
You're a coward.

773
01:14:43,867 --> 01:14:45,335
Yes.

774
01:14:45,702 --> 01:14:47,830
This life sickens me.

775
01:14:47,938 --> 01:14:49,599
I will not be forced to take on

776
01:14:49,706 --> 01:14:52,540
a responsibility that will make me live
for one day longer than I want to.

777
01:14:52,643 --> 01:14:57,512
And you know
that I mean what I say.

778
01:15:09,927 --> 01:15:11,758
I know that this is wrong.

779
01:15:11,862 --> 01:15:14,193
There's neither right nor wrong.

780
01:15:14,298 --> 01:15:18,428
We act according to our needs.

781
01:15:18,536 --> 01:15:19,798
And what are they?

782
01:15:20,537 --> 01:15:25,031
Yours is a hellish desire
to live and to create life.

783
01:15:25,142 --> 01:15:26,268
And yours?

784
01:15:27,411 --> 01:15:31,403
Mine is to be dead.
Stone-dead.

785
01:15:44,295 --> 01:15:48,061
If you want to smoke a cigarette,
I don't mind.

786
01:15:52,402 --> 01:15:55,201
Why have you told me all this?

787
01:15:57,674 --> 01:16:03,613
I saw you with your mother,
and I was panic-stricken.

788
01:16:05,116 --> 01:16:06,777
I don't understand.

789
01:16:09,320 --> 01:16:13,653
I thought: That's his mother.

790
01:16:14,457 --> 01:16:19,521
An old woman, cold as ice,

791
01:16:19,629 --> 01:16:22,656
more forbidding than death.

792
01:16:23,933 --> 01:16:26,164
And this is her son,

793
01:16:26,704 --> 01:16:29,901
and there are light-years
between them.

794
01:16:30,907 --> 01:16:33,570
He himself says
he's a living corpse.

795
01:16:35,679 --> 01:16:41,082
And Evald is growing
just as lonely, cold and dead.

796
01:16:42,786 --> 01:16:45,755
And I thought of the baby inside me.

797
01:16:46,756 --> 01:16:51,022
All along the line,
there's nothing but cold and death

798
01:16:51,128 --> 01:16:54,097
and loneliness.

799
01:16:54,999 --> 01:16:57,330
It must end somewhere.

800
01:16:58,501 --> 01:17:01,027
But you're going back to Evald!

801
01:17:02,807 --> 01:17:05,866
To say I can't agree
to his conditions.

802
01:17:05,976 --> 01:17:09,969
I want this child.
No one can take it from me.

803
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:12,514
Not even the man
I love most of all.

804
01:17:15,986 --> 01:17:18,010
Can I help you?

805
01:17:18,121 --> 01:17:19,589
No one can help me.

806
01:17:21,192 --> 01:17:24,251
We are too old.
Things have gone too far.

807
01:17:25,196 --> 01:17:28,028
What happened after your talk?

808
01:17:28,131 --> 01:17:30,599
Nothing.
I left him the next day.

809
01:17:31,134 --> 01:17:33,228
Hasn't he gotten in touch with you?

810
01:17:35,171 --> 01:17:39,905
- I don't want us to get...
- To get what?

811
01:17:41,679 --> 01:17:44,272
Like those two in the car today.

812
01:17:46,049 --> 01:17:48,678
I was just thinking of them.

813
01:17:49,219 --> 01:17:52,711
It reminded me of my own marriage.

814
01:17:53,456 --> 01:17:55,287
But we love each other.

815
01:17:55,392 --> 01:17:57,860
<i>Long may he live
Long may he live</i>

816
01:17:57,961 --> 01:18:00,795
<i>May he live to be
a hundred years old</i>

817
01:18:03,099 --> 01:18:06,000
We heard you're celebrating
a grand occasion today.

818
01:18:06,103 --> 01:18:10,300
With these simple flowers
we want to say

819
01:18:10,406 --> 01:18:14,969
<i>that we are very impressed
that you've been a doctor for 50 years.</i>

820
01:18:15,079 --> 01:18:18,879
We know you must be
a very wise old man

821
01:18:19,683 --> 01:18:22,379
<i>who knows everything about life</i>

822
01:18:22,486 --> 01:18:26,923
and has learned
all the instructions by heart.

823
01:18:29,226 --> 01:18:31,660
Thank you.

824
01:18:32,929 --> 01:18:36,093
Now we must go on.
It's getting late.

825
01:19:05,196 --> 01:19:09,656
So you did come.
Evald and I had given up hope.

826
01:19:09,933 --> 01:19:12,697
A nice drive is relaxing, isn't it?

827
01:19:13,536 --> 01:19:16,505
You'll have to get
into your tails at once.

828
01:19:17,540 --> 01:19:21,170
Good afternoon, Marianne.
I've told Evald you're coming.

829
01:19:21,277 --> 01:19:23,745
Thank you.
That was most kind.

830
01:19:24,781 --> 01:19:26,647
So you came after all, Miss Agda.

831
01:19:26,750 --> 01:19:31,847
I considered it my duty.
But my pleasure's been spoiled.

832
01:19:33,156 --> 01:19:34,714
Welcome, Father.

833
01:19:35,992 --> 01:19:38,018
As you see,
I've brought Marianne with me.

834
01:19:38,128 --> 01:19:40,857
- Hello, Marianne.
- May I put my things upstairs?

835
01:19:40,964 --> 01:19:43,956
The guest room as usual, Father?

836
01:19:44,067 --> 01:19:46,433
Let me take your bag.
It's rather heavy.

837
01:19:50,340 --> 01:19:53,207
- Did you have a good trip?
- Yes, it was pleasant.

838
01:19:53,309 --> 01:19:54,537
Who are those young people?

839
01:19:54,644 --> 01:19:56,839
I don't know. They're nice,
and they're off to Italy.

840
01:19:56,946 --> 01:19:59,915
- They seem nice.
- Yes, they're very nice.

841
01:20:00,017 --> 01:20:02,713
It's a quarter past 4:00.

842
01:20:07,825 --> 01:20:09,816
I've bought you new shoelaces.

843
01:20:18,768 --> 01:20:21,134
I'm leaving tomorrow,
so don't worry.

844
01:20:21,237 --> 01:20:23,638
- Are you going to a hotel?
- No, why?

845
01:20:23,741 --> 01:20:27,472
Can't we share the bedroom
for one more night? Unless you object.

846
01:20:27,577 --> 01:20:30,546
- Give me a hand unpacking?
- It's nice to see you.

847
01:20:30,714 --> 01:20:32,613
And unexpected.

848
01:20:32,715 --> 01:20:34,411
Same here.

849
01:20:34,518 --> 01:20:37,351
Are we going on
to the banquet afterwards?

850
01:20:37,454 --> 01:20:41,982
Yes, I'll just call Stenberg
and tell him I'll have a lady with me.

851
01:20:49,633 --> 01:20:51,759
Hurry up, Professor!

852
01:22:26,696 --> 01:22:31,634
<i>During the ceremony,</i>

853
01:22:31,735 --> 01:22:35,670
<i>my thoughts strayed
to the day's events,</i>

854
01:22:36,473 --> 01:22:40,670
<i>and it was then I decided</i>

855
01:22:40,777 --> 01:22:43,576
<i>to write down what had happened.</i>

856
01:22:44,046 --> 01:22:49,951
<i>In this jumble of events,</i>

857
01:22:50,053 --> 01:22:54,250
<i>I seemed to discern
an extraordinary logic.</i>

858
01:23:19,916 --> 01:23:22,885
Did you enjoy the ceremony?

859
01:23:22,986 --> 01:23:24,714
Yes, thank you.

860
01:23:26,589 --> 01:23:28,113
Are you tired, Miss Agda?

861
01:23:28,224 --> 01:23:29,817
I won't deny it.

862
01:23:29,927 --> 01:23:31,951
Take one of my sleeping pills.

863
01:23:34,798 --> 01:23:39,701
Miss Agda, I am sorry
about this morning.

864
01:23:40,237 --> 01:23:42,170
Are you ill, Professor?

865
01:23:42,272 --> 01:23:44,205
No. Why?

866
01:23:44,308 --> 01:23:47,744
I don't like the sound of it.

867
01:23:48,378 --> 01:23:50,710
Is it so rare
for me to say I'm sorry?

868
01:23:53,416 --> 01:23:55,749
Do you want the carafe
on the table?

869
01:24:19,910 --> 01:24:23,812
Thank you anyway, Professor.
Good night.

870
01:24:24,414 --> 01:24:26,143
Miss Agda,

871
01:24:28,151 --> 01:24:32,451
as we have known each other

872
01:24:32,555 --> 01:24:34,683
for so many years,

873
01:24:34,790 --> 01:24:38,282
don't you think we could call
each other Agda and Isak?

874
01:24:38,394 --> 01:24:41,057
No, I don't.

875
01:24:41,164 --> 01:24:42,460
Why not?

876
01:24:43,232 --> 01:24:45,063
Have you brushed your teeth,
Professor?

877
01:24:46,937 --> 01:24:51,032
No intimacies for me, thank you.

878
01:24:51,140 --> 01:24:53,302
It's all right between us as it is.

879
01:24:53,410 --> 01:24:56,344
But we are old now.

880
01:24:56,446 --> 01:25:01,213
Speak for yourself.
A woman is jealous of her reputation.

881
01:25:01,919 --> 01:25:06,151
What would people think if we
suddenly began to say Agda and Isak?

882
01:25:06,255 --> 01:25:08,189
They would make fun of us.

883
01:25:08,291 --> 01:25:11,692
Are you always right?

884
01:25:11,795 --> 01:25:13,853
Almost always.

885
01:25:13,964 --> 01:25:18,957
At our age,
we should know how to behave.

886
01:25:26,108 --> 01:25:30,442
Good night, Professor.
I'll leave the door ajar.

887
01:25:30,546 --> 01:25:34,573
You know where I am
if you want anything.

888
01:26:20,229 --> 01:26:23,893
Father Isak! You were splendid
in the procession.

889
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,969
We were terribly proud
to know you.

890
01:26:26,068 --> 01:26:30,027
An old girl is giving us a lift
all the way to Hamburg.

891
01:26:30,139 --> 01:26:33,040
- Anders is mad about her.
- Oh, be quiet.

892
01:26:33,143 --> 01:26:34,939
We just wanted to say good-bye.

893
01:26:35,045 --> 01:26:37,478
Good-bye. And thank you
for your company.

894
01:26:39,816 --> 01:26:42,113
It's you I really love, you know.

895
01:26:42,219 --> 01:26:46,245
Today, tomorrow, always.

896
01:26:46,756 --> 01:26:48,621
I'll remember.

897
01:26:49,058 --> 01:26:51,754
Come on.

898
01:26:57,200 --> 01:27:00,965
We have to go now.

899
01:27:04,573 --> 01:27:06,701
Let me hear from you.

900
01:27:18,821 --> 01:27:21,312
- I think Uncle is asleep.
- Evald!

901
01:27:23,160 --> 01:27:24,421
Yes, Father?

902
01:27:24,527 --> 01:27:26,155
Are you back already?

903
01:27:27,496 --> 01:27:29,964
Marianne lost the heel on a shoe.

904
01:27:31,902 --> 01:27:34,062
So you're going to the dance?

905
01:27:35,237 --> 01:27:37,171
I suppose so.

906
01:27:38,308 --> 01:27:41,367
- How are you, Father?
- Excellent.

907
01:27:41,478 --> 01:27:44,207
- Heart all right?
- Excellent.

908
01:27:45,982 --> 01:27:48,040
Sleep well.

909
01:27:50,253 --> 01:27:53,245
Sit down a moment.

910
01:27:54,957 --> 01:27:56,857
Anything special?

911
01:27:58,161 --> 01:28:03,496
How is it to be
between you and Marianne?

912
01:28:04,968 --> 01:28:06,594
Forgive my asking.

913
01:28:06,702 --> 01:28:08,192
I don't know.

914
01:28:09,039 --> 01:28:11,803
It's not my business, but...

915
01:28:13,809 --> 01:28:16,335
But wouldn't it...

916
01:28:16,446 --> 01:28:18,470
I have asked her to stay with me.

917
01:28:18,581 --> 01:28:20,777
Shouldn't you... I mean...

918
01:28:20,884 --> 01:28:25,150
- I can't live without her.
- You mean alone?

919
01:28:25,254 --> 01:28:28,314
<i>I can't live without her.
That's what I mean.</i>

920
01:28:28,424 --> 01:28:30,393
Oh, I see.

921
01:28:30,494 --> 01:28:32,223
It will be as she wants.

922
01:28:32,661 --> 01:28:35,323
And she...

923
01:28:35,965 --> 01:28:39,129
She says she'll think about it.

924
01:28:40,036 --> 01:28:41,969
About that debt of yours...

925
01:28:42,071 --> 01:28:44,302
Don't worry,
you'll get your money.

926
01:28:44,406 --> 01:28:47,000
That's not what I meant.

927
01:28:49,478 --> 01:28:50,844
How are you, Uncle Isak?

928
01:28:50,946 --> 01:28:52,880
Fine. Just fine.

929
01:28:52,982 --> 01:28:55,974
I lost a heel.
Will these shoes do?

930
01:28:56,085 --> 01:28:58,554
They're very nice.

931
01:29:01,491 --> 01:29:03,584
Thanks for coming with me.

932
01:29:06,929 --> 01:29:09,830
I like you, Marianne.

933
01:29:10,467 --> 01:29:12,764
I like you too, Uncle Isak.

934
01:29:21,244 --> 01:29:25,407
<i>If I have been worried
or sad during the day,</i>

935
01:29:25,915 --> 01:29:31,478
<i>it often calms me
to recall childhood memories.</i>

936
01:29:32,488 --> 01:29:34,854
<i>I did so on this evening too.</i>

937
01:29:46,736 --> 01:29:50,103
Isak, there are no
wild strawberries left.

938
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:53,071
Auntie wants you
to look for your papa.

939
01:29:53,175 --> 01:29:55,871
We'll sail around and meet you
at the other side of the island.

940
01:29:56,312 --> 01:30:00,682
I can't find either Papa or Mama.

941
01:30:01,284 --> 01:30:03,878
Come, I'll help you.
