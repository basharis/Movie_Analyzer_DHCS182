1
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,250
- Joint raided!
- No, no.

2
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:51,420
It's just our Raymond.
Our lovable Sergeant Shaw.

3
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,520
All right, let's go, you men! Come on!

4
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,850
Let's go.

5
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,870
Come on, Sarge.
Gertrude buy you beer.

6
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,530
What's the matter him?

7
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,760
I'm afraid our Saint Raymond,
he don't approve.

8
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:11,320
Well, maybe he's got a girl
back home or something.

9
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:13,610
Him? Our Raymond?
Are you kidding?

10
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,740
Come on, Stevens, get up! Let's go!

11
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,190
- Hey, Silver, how about the robe?
- What do you mean, my robe? Get outta here.

12
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:22,260
We gotta go.
We gotta go.

13
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,400
Bad here.

14
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,240
- How do you know?
- Chunjin born two miles from here, Captain.

15
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:56,280
So far, every place we've been in Korea,
this joker was born two miles from it.

16
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:58,620
- What's so bad about it?
- Tricky.

17
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,410
Swamp all around.
Thirty yards up may be quicksand.

18
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:03,620
Nobody said anything
about quicksand.

19
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,750
Can't we go around it?

20
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:08,670
No, Sergeant.

21
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:10,840
What's your personal advice?

22
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,170
All walk in single line next 200 yards.

23
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:16,180
Rejected. Not tactical
to travel forward in a single line.

24
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,680
Patrol sink.

25
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,140
Can't we go around it?

26
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,180
- No, Sergeant.
- Never mind.

27
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,940
Okay, pass the word.

28
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:39,590
<i>This nation jealously guards</i>
<i>its highest award for valor,</i>

29
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:41,840
<i>the Congressional Medal of Honor.</i>

30
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:46,720
<i>In the Korean War,</i>
<i>with 5,720,000 personnel engaged,</i>

31
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:49,610
<i>only 77 men were so honored.</i>

32
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:54,360
<i>One of these 77 men</i>
<i>was Staff Sergeant Raymond Shaw.</i>

33
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:59,610
<i>Raymond Shaw was returned from combat</i>
<i>and flown directly to Washington</i>

34
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:03,450
<i>to be decorated personally</i>
<i>by the president of the United States.</i>

35
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:07,200
<i>This is why his presence, or the presence</i>
<i>of any Medal of Honor winner,</i>

36
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:10,420
<i>is sufficient to bring generals</i>
<i>to their feet, saluting.</i>

37
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:23,130
Congratulations, son.
How do you feel?

38
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:26,060
Like Captain Idiot in
<i>Astounding Science Comics.</i>

39
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:28,810
Hold it, General!

40
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:31,600
Hold it, General, please!

41
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,400
Come on, Jack. We've got to
get in there quickly. Quickly!

42
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:41,990
Mother, what is this?
What are you doing here?

43
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,800
- Senator Iselin, how about a statement?
- Thank you, General.

44
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,910
How does it feel to be the father
of a Medal of Honor winner?

45
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:53,250
He's <i>not</i> my father!

46
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:55,810
The senator is Raymond's stepfather.
However, Raymond's always...

47
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:59,670
I can only say that as one who has
devoted his life to the service of his country...

48
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:02,000
You did this, Mother.

49
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,020
You organized
this disgusting three-ring circus.

50
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,170
But, darling,
you're a Medal of Honor winner.

51
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:07,680
Incidentally, congratulations.

52
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:11,130
I was going to write to you, but we've been in
the most frightful mess the last few months.

53
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:14,220
- This moment will stand out as the proudest...
- All right, all right. Let him through.

54
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:17,740
That's enough now.
That's enough, I say. Let him through.

55
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,070
Say "cheese."

56
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:26,700
All right, that's enough now.
Let the poor boy through now. Please.

57
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:33,390
What is the matter with you, Raymond?
We've gone to a good deal of trouble to...

58
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:36,200
- Arranged a parade for you and so forth.
- A parade?

59
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,870
Get that... Get that out of here.

60
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:40,170
Why, you publicity-sick,
flag-simple boob.

61
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:43,110
Raymond, just because your parents,
and the entire country for that matter,

62
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:45,280
- happens to be proud of you...
- Who's kidding who, Mother?

63
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:47,300
Johnny's up for reelection in November.

64
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,300
You've got it all figured out,
haven't you?

65
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:53,100
Johnny Iselin's boy, Medal of Honor winner.
That should get you another 50,000 votes.

66
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,100
Raymond, I'm your mother.
How can you talk to me this way?

67
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,100
You know I want nothing for myself.

68
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,280
You know that my entire life is devoted
to helping you and to helping Johnny.

69
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:04,070
- My boys. My two little boys.
- Mother, stop it. Stop it.

70
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:05,650
- Stop it.
- That is all I want.

71
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:08,070
<i>On the afternoon</i>
<i>of his arrival in Washington,</i>

72
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:10,320
<i>Raymond Shaw was decorated</i>
<i>at the White House</i>

73
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:12,620
<i>by the president of the United States.</i>

74
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,950
<i>His citation attested to</i>
<i>by his commanding officer,</i>

75
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:17,500
<i>Captain Bennett Marco,</i>

76
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,500
<i>and the nine surviving members</i>
<i>of his patrol, read in part...</i>

77
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,750
<i>"Displaying valor above</i>
<i>and beyond the call of duty,</i>

78
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:28,470
<i>did single-handedly save the lives</i>
<i>of nine members of his patrol,</i>

79
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:30,680
<i>capturing an enemy machine gun nest</i>

80
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:34,300
<i>and taking out, in the process,</i>
<i>a full company of enemy infantry.</i>

81
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,310
<i>He then proceeded</i>
<i>to lead his patrol,</i>

82
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:39,310
<i>which had been listed</i>
<i>as missing in action for three days,</i>

83
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:41,400
<i>back through the enemy lines to safety."</i>

84
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:50,360
A gift from the Citizens For Iselin Committee
for his last birthday.

85
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,500
It's absolutely saved our lives
during the campaign.

86
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,040
You see, this opens up
into a double bed.

87
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,800
This is the press room.

88
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,970
And this... this is my private office.

89
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:08,340
Anything to take the pain
out of campaigning, huh?

90
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,770
That's what I always say.

91
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:15,100
May I take this thing off now, Mother?

92
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,100
Oh, Raymond,
what is the matter with you?

93
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,210
You look as if your head were going to
come to a point in the next 13 seconds.

94
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:23,100
Johnny, fix him a drink or something.
Sit down, Raymond. Relax.

95
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,560
We'll be home
in less than two and a half hours.

96
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:28,570
I'm not going home with you, Mother.
I'm going to New York.

97
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:29,670
What?

98
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:32,360
I've got a job on a newspaper.

99
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:34,820
Research assistant
to Mr. Holborn Gaines.

100
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,950
Holborn Gaines?
That Communist?

101
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:41,200
He's not a Communist, Mother.
As a matter of fact, he's a Republican.

102
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:44,680
But the terrible things
he's written about Johnny.

103
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,380
He came to interview me
at the White House this morning.

104
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,560
Afterwards, I asked him for a job.
He gave it to me.

105
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:55,340
We discovered that we had
a great deal in common.

106
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,470
What could you possibly have in common
with that dreadful old man?

107
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:03,780
Well, for one thing, we discovered that
we both loathe and despise you and Johnny.

108
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,860
And that's a beginning.

109
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:16,450
<i>The war in Korea was over.</i>

110
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:19,370
<i>Captain, now Major Bennett Marco</i>
<i>had been reassigned</i>

111
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:22,130
<i>to Army Intelligence in Washington.</i>

112
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:28,790
<i>It was, by and large, a pleasant assignment,</i>
<i>except for one thing.</i>

113
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:33,810
<i>Night after night, the major was plagued</i>
<i>by the same reoccurring nightmare.</i>

114
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:54,320
Stop him.

115
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,580
Stop him, Mama.
Stop him, Mama.

116
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,880
Stop him.

117
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:01,490
Stop him.

118
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:04,920
Another modern discovery
which we owe to the hydrangea...

119
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:10,540
concerns the influence of air drainage
upon plant climate.

120
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,590
Many years ago, when I was
traveling about the country,

121
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:17,800
I noticed magnificent hydrangeas
on the hills

122
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:21,350
where the air drainage was, uh, perfect,

123
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:23,350
and very poor specimens,

124
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:25,060
or perhaps none at all,

125
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,890
in the valleys.

126
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:30,150
Formerly, we used to
consider sheltered valleys

127
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:33,110
more favorable to plants than hilltops.

128
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:36,780
But the avoidance of late spring
and early autumn frosts

129
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,530
enjoyed by sites
with good air drainage,

130
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:43,200
where the cold air can drain
safely away to lower levels,

131
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:46,830
gives the hills
a decided advantage.

132
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:50,460
Thus it was the hydrangeas
that gave the first pointer

133
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,640
in another modern discovery
of horticultural importance.

134
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:59,720
From this it might appear that
the hydrangea is a fairly simple plant,

135
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,510
but there are more complications.

136
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:06,640
The cultivation of hydrangeas was evolved
from a number of varieties

137
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:09,020
originally found in Japan,

138
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,690
not all of which, of course,
have the same characteristics.

139
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:17,570
Two of them do not share the quality
of producing blue flowers

140
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:19,830
in mineral-rich soils.

141
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:31,250
Allow me to introduce
our American visitors.

142
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:34,750
I must ask you to forgive their
somewhat lackadaisical manners,

143
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:36,460
but I have conditioned them,

144
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,680
or brainwashed them, which I understand
is the new American word,

145
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:43,180
to believe that they are
waiting out a storm

146
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,970
in a lobby of a small hotel
in New Jersey

147
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:49,930
where a meeting of
the ladies' garden club is in progress.

148
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:54,230
You will notice that I have told them
they may smoke.

149
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:57,730
I've allowed my people
to have a little fun

150
00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:02,210
in the selection of
bizarre tobacco substitutes.

151
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,750
Are you enjoying
your cigarette, Ed?

152
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:08,210
Yes, ma'am.

153
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,620
Yak dung.

154
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,510
Oh, tastes good like a cigarette should.

155
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,960
Now then, comrades...

156
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:20,840
May I present
the famous Raymond Shaw.

157
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:23,260
The young man
you've flown 8,000 miles

158
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,350
to this dreary spot in Manchuria to see.

159
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:29,980
Raymond, pull your chair
over here by me, please.

160
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:36,110
I am sure you've all heard
the old wives' tale

161
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:38,780
that no hypnotized subject
may be forced to do

162
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,950
that which is repellent
to his moral nature,

163
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:43,700
whatever that may be.

164
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,530
Nonsense, of course.

165
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:50,330
Oh, you note-takers might set down
a reminder to consult Brenman's paper,

166
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:56,500
"Experiments in the Hypnotic Production
of Antisocial and Self-Injurious Behavior,"

167
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:00,170
or Wells' 1941 paper
which was titled, I believe,

168
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:02,930
"Experiments in the
Hypnotic Production of Crime."

169
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,850
Or, of course,
Andrew Salter's remarkable book,

170
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:09,180
<i>Conditioned Reflex Therapy,</i>

171
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,270
to name only three.

172
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:14,520
Or if it offends you
that only the West is working

173
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:17,610
to manufacture more crime
and better criminals...

174
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:20,190
against the modern shortages,

175
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:24,280
I suggest Krasnogorski's
<i>Primary Violence Motivation,</i>

176
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:28,780
or Serov's <i>The Unilateral Suggestion
to Self-Destruction.</i>

177
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,700
My dear Yen,

178
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,460
as you grow older
you grow more long-winded.

179
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,000
Can't we get to the point?

180
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:40,920
Has the man ever killed anyone
or has he not?

181
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:44,050
I apologize, my dear Dimitri.

182
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:49,230
I keep forgetting that you're a young country
and your attention span is limited.

183
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:54,180
Tell me, Raymond,
have you ever killed anyone?

184
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:57,030
- No, ma'am.
- Not even in combat?

185
00:15:58,450 --> 00:15:59,990
In combat?

186
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,900
Yes, ma'am, I think so.

187
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,070
Of course you have, Raymond.

188
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:07,410
Raymond has been a crack shot
since childhood.

189
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:09,960
Marvelous outlet for his aggressions.

190
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:12,790
May I have the bayonet, please?

191
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:15,910
Not with the knife.
With the hands.

192
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:17,960
With the hands?

193
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,960
Here. Have him use this.

194
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:22,010
Ah. <i>Da, da.</i>

195
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:32,970
Raymond, whom do you dislike the least
in your group here today?

196
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:35,190
- The least?
- That's right.

197
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:38,980
Well, I guess Captain Marco, ma'am.

198
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:42,770
You notice how he is
always drawn to authority.

199
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:44,400
That won't do, Raymond.

200
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,690
We need the captain
to get you your medal.

201
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:48,740
Whom else?

202
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,780
Well, I guess Ed Mavole, ma'am.

203
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,660
Ah, that's better.

204
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,540
Now then, Raymond,

205
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,880
take this scarf

206
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:02,250
and strangle Ed Mavole.

207
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:04,050
Uh, to death.

208
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:05,720
Yes, ma'am.

209
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,810
- Excuse me, Ben.
- Mm-hmm.

210
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,270
Pardon me.

211
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:26,480
- Hey, Sarge, cut it out.
- Quiet, Ed, please.

212
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:30,660
Now, you just sit there quietly
and cooperate.

213
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,420
Yes, ma'am.

214
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:45,500
Major, to your knowledge,

215
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,310
have any other ex-members of your patrol
had similar dreams?

216
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:52,850
No, sir, not to my knowledge.

217
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:57,400
Doesn't it strike anyone
as curious that

218
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:01,740
Mavole was one of the two men
lost in the action and...

219
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,740
yet every night in my dream,
he's the...

220
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:08,950
he's the one that Raymond...

221
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:13,570
I'm sorry, gentlemen.

222
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:15,530
Now look, Major Marco,

223
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:19,040
since you first brought this recurring
dream of yours to our attention,

224
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:23,040
Raymond Shaw, his life, his background,
his habits, his friends and associates

225
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:25,340
have been under
scrupulous examination.

226
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,920
Now, the facts speak for themselves.

227
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:30,630
His stepfather
is a United States senator.

228
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:33,840
His mother is head of
15 different patriotic organizations.

229
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:37,390
Raymond Shaw himself is employed
as confidential assistant to Holborn Gaines,

230
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:39,890
the most respected
political journalist in America.

231
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:42,270
- Now, it's inconceivable, Major, that any...
- Major Marco.

232
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:44,150
Major, as the consulting
psychiatrist present,

233
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:47,320
I'd be most interested in hearing
your personal feelings about Shaw.

234
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:53,400
Raymond Shaw
is the kindest, bravest, warmest,

235
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,000
most wonderful human being
I've ever known in my life.

236
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:57,910
I see.

237
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:01,120
And this opinion, Major,
was it generally held?

238
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:03,840
His fellow soldiers, did they feel
the same way toward him?

239
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,040
The men loved him, sir.

240
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:09,250
Why shouldn't they?
He saved their lives.

241
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:12,590
It would seem obvious to me

242
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:14,630
Major Marco is suffering
a delayed reaction

243
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:17,350
to 18 months
of continuous combat in Korea.

244
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:22,100
I would strongly recommend that the matter
of Raymond Shaw be dropped here and now

245
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,810
and that Major Marco
be temporarily reassigned

246
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:26,350
to less, uh, strenuous

247
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:28,820
and, if I may say so,
less sensitive duties.

248
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:32,440
I think a few months,
uh, detached service

249
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:35,820
to, uh, well,
perhaps the public relations corps

250
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,950
should put the major
right back in the pink.

251
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:41,950
Mr. Secretary! Mr. Secretary!

252
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:45,420
Can you explain
the proposed cut in budget?

253
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:48,790
Since, sir, you have asked
a simple-minded question,

254
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:52,130
I will give you an equally
simple-minded answer.

255
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:55,550
Since no great naval power
menaces the free world today,

256
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:58,090
the navy's overwhelming
preponderance of surface ships

257
00:19:58,190 --> 00:19:59,640
seems to be superfluous.

258
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:02,010
Hence the cut in budget.

259
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:04,600
Major, my time is important.

260
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,980
How much longer must we
go on with this nonsense?

261
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,480
Yes, sir.

262
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:10,570
If there are no further questions
for the secretary,

263
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:12,480
I think that about wraps things up.

264
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:15,380
Mr. Secretary.

265
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,110
I have a question, sir.

266
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:19,780
Who are you, sir?

267
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:23,580
I am United States Senator
John Yerkes Iselin,

268
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,210
and I have a question so serious

269
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:30,720
that the safety of our nation
may well depend on your answer.

270
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,760
Who?

271
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:35,840
No evasions, Mr. Secretary.

272
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:38,050
No evasions, if you please, sir.

273
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:40,220
Evasions? What the hell
are you talking about?

274
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,220
What kind of foolishness is this?

275
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,220
Mr. Secretary,
I'm kinda new at this job,

276
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,560
but I don't think it's good public relations
to talk that way to a United States senator,

277
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:48,730
even if he is an idiot.

278
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:51,770
I am United States Senator
John Yerkes Iselin,

279
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:57,030
and I have here a list of
the names of 207 persons

280
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:59,360
who are known
by the secretary of defense

281
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:02,530
as being members
of the Communist party!

282
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:05,080
- What?
- And who are still, nevertheless...

283
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,830
If you have such a list,
bring it up here!

284
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:10,880
shaping the policy
of the Defense Department!

285
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:13,460
Senator who? What the hell
did you say your name was?

286
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,460
I demand an answer, Mr. Secretary.

287
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:18,050
There will be no covering up, sir.

288
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:20,510
- What?
- No covering up.

289
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,650
You are not going to get
your hands on this list.

290
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,430
How did you get in here in the first place?

291
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:27,180
- And I deeply regret...
- Major, throw that lunatic out of here!

292
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,060
having to say,
in front of these ladies and gentlemen...

293
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:33,060
- You claim that you're a senator?
- and television and radio audience

294
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,050
- of our great country...
- Senator what, I wanna know.

295
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:38,240
that you no longer
have my confidence, sir!

296
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:41,110
Why, you're an idiot, if you ask me!
You're out of your mind!

297
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:45,120
This is no longer a matter for investigation
by the Defense Department!

298
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,450
Get out of here!
Where's the sergeant at arms?

299
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:50,380
- I'm afraid you have lost your chance, sir.
- Get that man out of this room!

300
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,670
This matter is now the responsibility

301
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:54,920
of the United States Senate!

302
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:58,420
Get him out of this room!
I will not have him in here. Do you hear me?

303
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,760
No! Never!

304
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:04,010
If I ever catch you in this room again,
I'll throw you out bodily!

305
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:05,930
What do you want?
Get out of here!

306
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:08,600
- Hold it!
- Don't you take my picture anymore!

307
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,980
Clear this room!
Get away from me!

308
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,600
- Go on! Get out of here!
- Senator. Senator Iselin, I'd like to...

309
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,650
- Yes.
- I'd like to verify that number, sir.

310
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:17,650
- Huh?
- How many Communists did you say?

311
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:20,820
Oh, uh...
Well, Major, I said there are exactly...

312
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,780
I have absolute proof there are, uh,

313
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,950
104 card-carrying Communists
in the Defense Department at this time.

314
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:28,540
- How many, sir?
- Uh... 275.

315
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,770
And that's absolutely all I have to say
on the subject at this time. Come, babe.

316
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:33,740
- Major, how many did he say?
- Hold it! Hold it!

317
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,540
- Excuse me.
- Hold it, Senator.

318
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,350
- Boys, please.
- Major, how many did he say?

319
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:21,750
Ladies.

320
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:24,340
Very good, Raymond.

321
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,680
Thank you, ma'am.

322
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,230
Captain Marco.

323
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:30,470
- Yes, ma'am?
- On your feet, Captain, please.

324
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:33,600
- Sorry, ma'am.
- Captain...

325
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:36,600
When you are returned
with your patrol to Korea

326
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:39,360
and you make your way
to command headquarters,

327
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:42,080
what will be the first duty
you will undertake?

328
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:46,360
I will make my report
on the patrol, ma'am.

329
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:48,820
What will you report?

330
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,580
I will recommend urgently

331
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:53,910
that Raymond Shaw
be posted for the Medal of Honor.

332
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:55,580
He saved our lives

333
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:58,210
and took out a complete company
of Chinese infantry.

334
00:23:58,310 --> 00:24:00,960
A complete company?
What the hell is this?

335
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:04,010
We can spare
an imaginary company of infantry

336
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:07,640
for this particular plan, Mikhail Mikhalich.

337
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:09,050
All right.

338
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:12,470
If we are out to humiliate
our brave Chinese ally

339
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:15,060
in the newspapers of the world,

340
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,980
we might as well make it
a full battalion.

341
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:21,820
We don't object, Comrade.
I assure you of that.

342
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:26,080
However, Comrade, we thank you
for thinking of the matter in that light.

343
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:31,000
If we may proceed
with the demonstration.

344
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:33,430
Raymond.

345
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:40,180
Who is that little fellow
sitting next to the captain?

346
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:43,500
That's Bobby Lembeck.

347
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,600
Our mascot,
I guess you'd call him.

348
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:49,140
Doesn't look old enough
to be in your army.

349
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,350
I guess he isn't,
but there he is, ma'am.

350
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:57,100
Captain Marco, will you be good enough
to lend Raymond your pistol, please?

351
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,780
Yes, ma'am.

352
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:06,290
- Thanks, Ben.
- Sure, kid.

353
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:12,040
Shoot Bobby Raymond
through the forehead.

354
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:14,920
Yes, ma'am.

355
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:28,300
Honey.
Wake up, wake up!

356
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,180
Wake up. Wake up.
It's all right.

357
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,340
It's all right.
It's all right.

358
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,220
It's all right.

359
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,430
It's all right. It's all right.

360
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:39,440
- It's that same dream again?
- Uh-huh.

361
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:42,020
It's all right.

362
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,480
What... What makes it so awful

363
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:48,580
is that I keep dreaming a thing like that
about Sergeant Shaw.

364
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:52,700
It's been going on for weeks now.

365
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,830
I must be going crazy!

366
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:56,890
What you ought to do
is to write to Sergeant Shaw.

367
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:58,380
I tell you, nothing's wrong with me!

368
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,750
Write to him and see if anyone else
is having dreams like yours.

369
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:03,420
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

370
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,630
Maybe... Maybe I will.

371
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:08,430
Yeah, maybe I'll do that.

372
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:12,840
If anybody can help me, he can.

373
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:15,600
You like him a lot, don't you?

374
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:18,360
Raymond Shaw is the bravest, kindest,
warmest, most wonderful human being

375
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:19,940
I've ever known in my life.

376
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,940
<i>Dear Sarge,</i>

377
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:56,450
<i>I had to say this or write this to someone</i>
<i>because I think I'm going nuts,</i>

378
00:27:56,550 --> 00:28:00,450
<i>and since you were my best friend</i>
<i>in the army, here goes.</i>

379
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:02,450
<i>Sarge, I'm in trouble.</i>

380
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:06,290
<i>I'm afraid to go to sleep</i>
<i>because I have terrible dreams.</i>

381
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:09,710
<i>I dream about all the guys on the patrol</i>
<i>where you won the medal,</i>

382
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:12,500
<i>and the dream has</i>
<i>a lot of Chinese people in it</i>

383
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:15,510
<i>and a lot of big brass</i>
<i>from the Russian Army.</i>

384
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:18,810
<i>Well, it's pretty rough.</i>
<i>You have to take my word for that.</i>

385
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,150
<i>Raymond Shaw, please.</i>

386
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:30,190
This is he.

387
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:31,860
<i>Raymond,</i>

388
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:35,660
<i>why don't you pass the time</i>
<i>by playing a little solitaire?</i>

389
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:38,810
<i>Raymond.</i>

390
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:42,060
- Yes, sir.
<i>- Can you see the red queen?</i>

391
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:44,970
Yes, sir.

392
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:47,240
<i>Good.</i>

393
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:49,230
<i>One week from next Saturday</i>

394
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:52,770
<i>you will be called for at 11:10 AM</i>

395
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:55,400
<i>and taken to</i>
<i>the Timothy Swardon Sanitarium,</i>

396
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:58,320
<i>84 East 61st Street.</i>

397
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:00,570
<i>We want you there for a checkup.</i>

398
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:02,160
<i>Is that clear?</i>

399
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:04,780
Yes, sir.

400
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,910
<i>You may put the cards away now.</i>

401
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:08,340
<i>Good-bye, Raymond.</i>

402
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:26,760
Mr. Gaines. It's Mr. Shaw.

403
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:29,770
He was run down in the street
by a hit-and-run driver.

404
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:31,350
It just came over the AP.

405
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:33,100
Good heavens.

406
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:37,200
Find out what hospital he's in and call them.
See if there's anything we can do to help.

407
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:42,370
You're welcome.
Good-bye.

408
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:47,200
That was Mr. Gaines
from his newspaper.

409
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:50,500
He said to tell him to take it easy
and not to worry about a thing.

410
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,500
Which, of course, you will not tell him,

411
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,630
on the chance it is some sort
of prearranged code.

412
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,180
- Comrade Zilkov?
- Yes?

413
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,770
Yen Lo.
Pavlov Institute?

414
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:14,090
Doctor,

415
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:16,820
an honor and a pleasure.

416
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:20,950
You may go.

417
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,330
When did you arrive?

418
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:37,960
I was flown in last night
under embassy quota.

419
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:39,630
Revolting journey.

420
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:42,600
Ah, Raymond.
Nice to see you again.

421
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:45,430
It's nice to see <i>you</i> again, sir.

422
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:49,850
We're going through
this elaborate procedure

423
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:52,560
simply out of precaution,

424
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,940
in case there are any visitors.

425
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:58,070
Although I cannot imagine
who will visit Raymond.

426
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,150
Attractive plant you have here.

427
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:04,700
Thank you, Doctor.

428
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:08,030
It's actually a rest home
for wealthy alcoholics.

429
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:10,290
We were able to purchase it
three years ago.

430
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:13,620
Except for this floor
and the floor above it,

431
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:16,000
which we have sealed off
for security purposes,

432
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,000
the rest functions quite normally.

433
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:20,630
In fact, it is one of the few
Soviet operations in America

434
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:23,800
that actually showed a profit
at the end of the last fiscal year.

435
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,470
Profit? Fiscal year?
Tsk-tsk-tsk-tsk-tsk-tsk.

436
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:27,930
Beware, my dear Zilkov.

437
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:30,550
The virus of capitalism
is highly infectious.

438
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:33,230
Soon you'll be letting money out
at interest.

439
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:39,860
You must try, Comrade Zilkov,
to cultivate a sense of humor.

440
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:43,650
There's nothing like a good laugh now and then
to lighten the burdens of the day.

441
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:45,990
Tell me, Raymond.

442
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:48,580
Do you remember murdering
Mavole and Lembeck?

443
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:51,240
I beg your pardon, sir?

444
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:53,700
Mavole and Lembeck.

445
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:56,290
The men who were lost on the patrol.

446
00:32:56,390 --> 00:32:59,330
Can you recall what happened to them?

447
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:01,230
Yes, sir.

448
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:04,960
It was a very clear action
for a night action.

449
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:07,590
Captain Marco
sent up some low flares

450
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:10,260
so it was easy to see
what was happening.

451
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:13,560
Bobby Lembeck
got separated to the left.

452
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:16,140
Mavole went after him.

453
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,610
By the time he reached him,
the enemy had a fix on the position.

454
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:24,400
They were killed instantly
by a high mortar shell.

455
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,490
I don't think they ever knew
what hit them.

456
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:28,150
Do you realize, Comrade,

457
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:33,080
the implications of the weapon
that has been placed at your disposal?

458
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:36,040
You may remove
your head bandage, Raymond.

459
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:40,580
A normally conditioned American
who has been trained to kill

460
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:43,750
and then to have no memory
of having killed.

461
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:45,750
Without memory of his deed,

462
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:47,970
he cannot possibly feel guilt.

463
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:51,970
Nor will he, of course,
have any reason to fear being caught.

464
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:57,180
And having been relieved of those uniquely
American symptoms, guilt and fear,

465
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:59,900
he cannot possibly give himself away.

466
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:04,770
Ah, our Raymond will remain
an outwardly normal, productive,

467
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:08,320
sober and respected member
of the community.

468
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:10,900
And I should say, if properly used,

469
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,500
entirely police-proof.

470
00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:16,490
His brain has not only
been washed, as they say,

471
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:18,420
it has been dry-cleaned.

472
00:34:22,930 --> 00:34:25,840
Thank you, Raymond.
You may replace your head bandage.

473
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:29,460
Sealed floors or no, you will,
of course, permit him to have visitors,

474
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,760
uh, to avoid suspicion.

475
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:33,140
Of course.

476
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,600
A team of my specialists
is being flown in tonight.

477
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:38,390
It will take about a week,
working between visiting hours,

478
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:40,690
to check the mechanism out
completely.

479
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,690
It's been, after all, two years

480
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:46,270
since the conditioning took place,

481
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:49,530
and you want to be sure the linkages
are still functioning correctly

482
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:52,620
before he is turned over
to his American operator.

483
00:34:53,370 --> 00:34:56,660
And now, Comrade,
if you will excuse me.

484
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,160
Where are you going?

485
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:01,460
Since there is nothing more I can do
until my specialists arrive,

486
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:04,130
I had thought to
spend the afternoon at Macy's.

487
00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:08,100
Madam Yen has given me
the most appalling list.

488
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:15,430
No, no.
I personally guarantee it.

489
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:18,390
He's ready to be turned over
to his American operator.

490
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:22,060
And I, being personally responsible
for Soviet security

491
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:25,230
in the entire Eastern Seaboard
of the United States,

492
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:28,020
refuse to turn him over
to his operator

493
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:31,150
until at least one practical test
has been run.

494
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:33,820
You say the man has been built
as an assassin.

495
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,320
Very well, then.

496
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:37,250
Let him assassinate someone.

497
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,540
I'm shocked

498
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:44,290
that a security officer
with the responsibility you hold

499
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:47,130
would risk a mechanism
as valuable as Raymond

500
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:50,130
out of sheer nervousness.

501
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:54,310
You yourself admit the man
has not killed for over two years.

502
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:56,680
I assure you, Doctor,

503
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:59,810
conditions offering minimum risk
can be arranged.

504
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:02,270
All right, if you insist
on this foolishness,

505
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:04,980
have him kill one of your own people
here on a sealed floor.

506
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,940
I would. I would, gladly.

507
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:11,110
But our table of organization happens
to be under acceptable strength as it is.

508
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:13,190
Why can't we be reasonable about this?

509
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:16,950
Why can't he kill some
nonproductive person on the outside?

510
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:18,950
Very well then.

511
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:20,620
But for his own protection,

512
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,620
he must be instructed
that if he is ever, at any time,

513
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:26,290
discovered at the scene
of an assignment,

514
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:30,540
this other person or persons
must also be killed.

515
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,630
All right, all right, Doctor.

516
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:34,890
Whom do you think he should kill?

517
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:46,900
With humor, my dear Zilkov.

518
00:36:47,690 --> 00:36:50,480
Always with a little humor.

519
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:53,780
If kill we must for a better New York,

520
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,940
why should it not be

521
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,110
his superior at the newspaper,

522
00:36:58,210 --> 00:37:01,410
Mr... Holborn Gaines?

523
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:03,830
With Mr. Gaines out of the way,

524
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:08,840
might he not then be given
that very influential job himself?

525
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:11,960
Who's there?

526
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:13,890
It's me, Mr. Gaines.

527
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:16,860
Raymond.

528
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:23,510
I'm sorry to disturb you, sir.

529
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:27,810
Don't get any silly ideas about
this ridiculous-looking bed jacket.

530
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:31,190
It was my wife's.
It's the warmest thing I have.

531
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:33,860
Perfect for reading in bed at night.

532
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,280
I didn't know you were married, sir.

533
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:38,700
She died nearly six years ago.

534
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,700
But what the devil are you doing here
at 4:00 in the morning?

535
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:44,130
Anyway, I thought you were
in the hospital.

536
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:48,910
Oh, now, don't tell me that you've
come here at this ridiculous hour

537
00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:50,920
to talk something over?

538
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:52,920
You're not gonna pour out your heart

539
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:56,590
with the details of some sordid love affair
or anything like that, are you?

540
00:37:56,690 --> 00:37:58,220
No, sir.

541
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:01,640
As a matter of fact,
they told me you'd be asleep.

542
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:03,850
Who told you I'd be asleep?

543
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:05,310
They did.

544
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:06,810
"They"?

545
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:09,460
<i>"They"?</i>

546
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,940
Who's this mysterious "they"?

547
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:13,610
Raymond?

548
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:15,490
Answer me, my boy.

549
00:38:31,010 --> 00:38:33,420
- Colonel.
- Ben. May I come in for a minute?

550
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,930
Oh, please do.
Of course. Come on in.

551
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:42,130
Uh, may I ask the colonel,
"A," is this an official visit?

552
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:44,550
And "B," may I, uh, mix you a drink?

553
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:46,560
"A," yes, it is,
and "B," you certainly may.

554
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:48,360
- Scotch all right?
- Fine.

555
00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:56,060
My God, where do you
get all the books?

556
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:59,230
Oh, I, uh... I got a guy
picks them out for me.

557
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:01,070
At random.

558
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:03,370
- Water all right?
- Fine.

559
00:39:04,370 --> 00:39:06,830
He's in, uh, San Francisco.

560
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:09,120
A little bookstore up there.

561
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:11,910
He ships 'em to me
wherever I happen to be stationed.

562
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:14,720
- You read them all?
- Yeah.

563
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:19,130
They'd also make great insulation
against an enemy attack.

564
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:22,130
But the, uh, truth of the matter is
that I'm just interested, you know,

565
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:27,690
in, uh, <i>The Principles of Modern Banking,</i>
and <i>History of Piracy,</i>

566
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:30,730
<i>Paintings of Orozco,</i>

567
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:33,780
<i>Modern French Theater,</i>

568
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:38,660
<i>The Jurisprudential Factor</i>
<i>of Mafia Administration,</i>

569
00:39:39,570 --> 00:39:42,910
<i>Diseases of Horses,</i>
the novels of Joyce Cary and...

570
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:46,530
ethnic choices of the Arabs...

571
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:48,500
things like that.

572
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:57,430
- Ben.
- Sir.

573
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:02,920
The army's got a lot of things wrong with it,
but it does take care of its own people.

574
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:04,770
Which is why I'm here.

575
00:40:05,810 --> 00:40:08,510
As a public relations officer,
you're a disaster.

576
00:40:08,610 --> 00:40:10,350
I never wanted the jo...

577
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:12,580
Apparently, among other things,
you permitted the secretary

578
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:15,190
to make a number of unfortunate remarks
to that idiot Iselin,

579
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:17,270
which started him off on a rampage.

580
00:40:17,370 --> 00:40:18,980
Mickey, listen to me, please.

581
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:22,730
For the last six months I've been driven nearly
out of my mind by this same recurring dream.

582
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:24,300
The medical officer in charge offered...

583
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,620
What the hell does the medical corps
know about intelligence work, Milt?

584
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:30,370
I tell you,
there's something phony going on.

585
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:32,950
There's something phony about me,
about Raymond Shaw,

586
00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:35,540
about the whole
Medal of Honor business.

587
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,540
For instance,
when the psychiatrist asked me

588
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:40,380
how I felt about Raymond Shaw,
how I personally felt about him,

589
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:43,100
and how the whole patrol felt about him,
did you hear what I said?

590
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,090
Did you really hear what I said?

591
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:48,470
I said, Raymond Shaw
is the kindest, warmest, bravest,

592
00:40:48,570 --> 00:40:51,430
most wonderful human being
I have ever known in my life.

593
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:53,600
And even now I feel that way,
this minute.

594
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:57,350
And yet somewhere in the back of my mind,
something tells me it's not true.

595
00:40:57,450 --> 00:40:59,450
It's just not true.

596
00:41:00,610 --> 00:41:02,980
It isn't as if Raymond's hard to like.

597
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:05,240
He's <i>impossible</i> to like.

598
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:09,410
In fact, he's probably one of
the most repulsive human beings

599
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:12,740
I've ever known in my whole...
all of my life.

600
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:17,040
Ben, what I came to tell you is,
public relations has bounced you back to me.

601
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:20,760
And in your present state
there's no possible way I can use you.

602
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:24,420
As of this moment,
I'm placing you on indefinite sick leave.

603
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,210
Go away, Ben.

604
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:28,640
Find yourself a girl.
Lie in the sun.

605
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:36,020
I absolutely refuse.

606
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:41,700
You don't seem to understand.

607
00:41:43,870 --> 00:41:46,690
What I've just told you
is not a suggestion, Major.

608
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:48,290
It is an order.

609
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:56,340
Yes, sir.

610
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,340
Good night, Ben.

611
00:43:14,830 --> 00:43:17,960
- Do you mind if I smoke?
- Not at all. Please do.

612
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:55,960
Maryland's a beautiful state.

613
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:59,410
- This is Delaware.
- I know.

614
00:43:59,510 --> 00:44:03,300
I was one of the original Chinese workmen
who laid the track on this stretch.

615
00:44:04,170 --> 00:44:07,580
But, um, nonetheless,
Maryland is a beautiful state.

616
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,680
So is Ohio, for that matter.

617
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:12,880
I guess so.

618
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:15,310
Columbus is
a tremendous football town.

619
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:20,900
- You in the railroad business?
- Not anymore.

620
00:44:22,070 --> 00:44:24,770
However, if you will permit me
to point out,

621
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:27,060
when you ask that question,
you really should say,

622
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:29,160
"Are you in the railroad line?"

623
00:44:31,990 --> 00:44:33,490
Where's your home?

624
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,210
I'm in the army.
I'm a major.

625
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:42,160
I've been in the army
most of my life.

626
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:44,250
We move a good deal.

627
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:48,380
I was born in New Hampshire.

628
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:52,050
I went to a girls' camp once
on Lake Francis.

629
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:55,920
That's pretty far north.

630
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:57,020
Yeah.

631
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:01,720
What's your name?

632
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:03,400
Eugenie.

633
00:45:05,110 --> 00:45:06,480
Pardon?

634
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:08,350
No kidding. I really mean it.

635
00:45:08,450 --> 00:45:10,740
Crazy French pronunciation and all.

636
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:14,030
- It's pretty.
- Well, thank you.

637
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:17,700
I guess your friends call you Jennie?

638
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:20,700
Not yet, they haven't,
for which I am deeply grateful.

639
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:23,130
But you may call me Jennie.

640
00:45:24,170 --> 00:45:26,210
What do your friends call you?

641
00:45:27,090 --> 00:45:28,290
Rosie.

642
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:30,020
Why?

643
00:45:31,550 --> 00:45:33,850
My full name is Eugenie Rose.

644
00:45:36,850 --> 00:45:39,510
Of the two names,
I've always favored Rosie

645
00:45:39,610 --> 00:45:42,940
because it smells of brown soap and beer.

646
00:45:46,150 --> 00:45:49,070
Eugenie is somehow more fragile.

647
00:45:53,570 --> 00:45:56,870
Still, when I asked you what your name was,
you said it was Eugenie.

648
00:45:58,950 --> 00:46:02,500
It's quite possible I was feeling
more or less fragile at that instant.

649
00:46:05,670 --> 00:46:09,420
I could never figure out
what that phrase meant, "more or less."

650
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:16,470
- Are you Arabic?
- No.

651
00:46:20,430 --> 00:46:22,510
My name is Ben.

652
00:46:22,610 --> 00:46:24,220
It's really Bennett.

653
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:26,430
I was named after Arnold Bennett.

654
00:46:26,530 --> 00:46:28,220
- The writer?
- No.

655
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:29,770
A lieutenant colonel.

656
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:32,490
He was my father's
commanding officer at the time.

657
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:37,620
- What's your last name?
- Marco.

658
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:40,830
Major Marco.

659
00:46:41,870 --> 00:46:43,700
Are <i>you</i> Arabic?

660
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:45,200
No. No.

661
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:49,080
Let me put it another way.

662
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:51,040
Are you married?

663
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:52,140
No.

664
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:54,180
- You?
- No.

665
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:04,350
- What's your last name?
- Cheyney.

666
00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:07,720
I'm production assistant
for a man named Justin

667
00:47:07,820 --> 00:47:09,850
who had two hits last season.

668
00:47:09,950 --> 00:47:11,850
I live on 54th Street,

669
00:47:11,950 --> 00:47:14,350
a few doors from
the Modern Museum of Art,

670
00:47:14,450 --> 00:47:18,200
of which I am
a tea-privileges member, no cream.

671
00:47:19,370 --> 00:47:22,570
I live at 53 West 54th Street.

672
00:47:22,670 --> 00:47:24,450
Apartment 3B.

673
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:26,040
Can you remember that?

674
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:28,880
Yes.

675
00:47:31,630 --> 00:47:34,420
Eldorado 5-9970.

676
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:37,390
Can you remember that?

677
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:40,720
Yes.

678
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:45,300
Are you stationed in New York?

679
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:48,150
Or is "stationed" the right word?

680
00:47:54,570 --> 00:47:58,060
I'm not exactly stationed in New York.
I was stationed in Washington.

681
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:00,650
But I got sick

682
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:04,370
and now I'm on leave
and I'm gonna s-spend it in New York.

683
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:08,420
Eldorado 5-9970.

684
00:48:15,090 --> 00:48:18,760
I'm gonna look up an old friend of mine
who's a newspaper man.

685
00:48:20,430 --> 00:48:22,560
We were in Korea together.

686
00:48:25,350 --> 00:48:28,600
Mr. Shaw, there's a gentleman
outside to see you.

687
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:32,680
- A gentleman?
- An Oriental gentleman, sir.

688
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:35,850
He said he was in the army with you.

689
00:48:35,950 --> 00:48:39,360
There were no Oriental gentlemen
in the army with me.

690
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:41,740
He is very insistent, sir.

691
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:46,370
All right, all right, show him in.

692
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:06,380
I am Chunjin, Mr. Shaw, sir.

693
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:09,550
I was interpreter attached
to Charlie Company,

694
00:49:09,650 --> 00:49:11,800
52nd Regiment.

695
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:13,720
Yes, I remember you.

696
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:16,230
You were the guide
and interpreter to the patrol.

697
00:49:16,330 --> 00:49:18,490
Yes, sir, Mr. Shaw.

698
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:22,400
What can I do for you?

699
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:24,820
I mean to say,
what are you doing here?

700
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:27,080
Your father did not say to you?

701
00:49:28,250 --> 00:49:29,700
- My father?
- Yes.

702
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,070
Senator Iselin. I...

703
00:49:31,170 --> 00:49:34,580
Senator Iselin is not my father.

704
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:37,420
Repeat. He is not my father.

705
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:42,640
If you learn nothing else on your visit
to this country, memorize that fact.

706
00:49:43,390 --> 00:49:45,840
I write to Senator Iselin.

707
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:48,970
I tell him how I interpret your outfit.

708
00:49:49,070 --> 00:49:51,590
I tell him I want to come to America.

709
00:49:51,690 --> 00:49:53,680
He get me visa.

710
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:54,980
Now I need job.

711
00:49:55,770 --> 00:49:56,970
A job?

712
00:49:57,530 --> 00:49:59,770
Yes, sir, Mr. Shaw.

713
00:49:59,870 --> 00:50:02,440
But, my dear fellow,
we don't need interpreters here.

714
00:50:02,540 --> 00:50:04,440
We all speak the same language.

715
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:08,360
I am tailor and mender.
I am cook. I drive car.

716
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:12,460
I am cleaner and scrubber.
I fix anything. I take message.

717
00:50:13,370 --> 00:50:15,540
I sleep at house of my cousin.

718
00:50:17,550 --> 00:50:20,040
I ask for job with you

719
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:22,080
because you are great man

720
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:24,180
who save my life.

721
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:31,380
I could use a valet, I think.

722
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:33,680
And I would like having a cook.

723
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:35,400
A good cook, I mean.

724
00:50:36,690 --> 00:50:39,890
Very well.
You can live at your cousin's.

725
00:50:39,990 --> 00:50:42,030
I will pay you $60 a week.

726
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:45,730
You will have every Thursday
and every other Sunday off.

727
00:50:45,830 --> 00:50:48,370
Thank you, Mr. Shaw.

728
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:52,990
I'm leaving for Washington in a few minutes.
I'll be back here this evening by 8:30.

729
00:50:53,090 --> 00:50:55,500
I would like to have dinner waiting.

730
00:50:56,290 --> 00:50:57,990
Yes, sir.

731
00:50:58,090 --> 00:50:59,620
Yes, sir, Mr. Shaw.

732
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:01,710
Just like United State Army.

733
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:05,260
Oh, God, I hope not.

734
00:51:08,220 --> 00:51:11,130
You're going to be perfectly
marvelous in there this afternoon, hon.

735
00:51:11,230 --> 00:51:13,230
I just know you are.

736
00:51:16,150 --> 00:51:17,150
Yeah.

737
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:25,060
There's just one thing, babe.

738
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:26,730
I'd be a lot happier

739
00:51:26,830 --> 00:51:29,400
if we could just settle
on the number of Communists

740
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:31,740
I know there are
in the Defense Department.

741
00:51:34,620 --> 00:51:37,700
I mean, the way you keep changing
the figures on me all the time,

742
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:41,790
it makes me look like
some kind of a nut, I-like an idiot.

743
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:44,500
The boys are even startin'
to kid me about it.

744
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:47,750
Why, just yesterday, in the cloakroom
they said, "Hey, Johnny"...

745
00:51:47,850 --> 00:51:49,910
Well, you're going to look like
an even bigger idiot

746
00:51:50,010 --> 00:51:53,380
if you don't get in there
and do <i>exactly</i> what you're told.

747
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:54,480
Babe.

748
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:58,510
Who are they writing about all over this country?
And what are they saying?

749
00:51:58,610 --> 00:52:01,520
Are they saying, Are there any Communists
in the Defense Department?

750
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:03,020
Of course not.

751
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:06,520
They're saying, <i>How many</i> Communists
are there in the Defense Department?

752
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:08,980
So just stop talking like an expert
all of a sudden

753
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:12,860
and get out there and say
what you're supposed to say.

754
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:15,490
Aw, come on, babe, I...

755
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:17,620
I'm sorry, hon.

756
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:22,000
Would it really make it easier for you
if we settled on just one number?

757
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:24,800
Yeah.

758
00:52:25,470 --> 00:52:30,680
Just one real simple number
that'd be easy for me to remember.

759
00:52:41,860 --> 00:52:44,430
There are exactly 57

760
00:52:44,530 --> 00:52:46,100
card-carrying members

761
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:48,100
of the Communist Party...

762
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:50,320
in the Department of Defense
at this time.

763
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:56,080
Point of order, Mr. Speaker.
Point of order, if you please.

764
00:53:25,650 --> 00:53:27,650
What was Raymond doing
with his hands?

765
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:36,450
How did the old ladies
turn into Russians?

766
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:21,910
What was Raymond doing
with his hands?

767
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:33,710
How did the old ladies
turn into Russians?

768
00:54:33,810 --> 00:54:35,750
What was Raymond doing
with his hands?

769
00:54:35,850 --> 00:54:38,710
What were <i>you</i> doing there?

770
00:54:38,810 --> 00:54:41,430
What was Raymond doing with his hands?

771
00:54:41,530 --> 00:54:43,890
What were you doing there?

772
00:54:43,990 --> 00:54:46,150
Get away...
What were you doing there?

773
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:08,870
Well, I must say
it was original of you

774
00:55:08,970 --> 00:55:12,720
to have the police department
call so shyly and ask for our first date.

775
00:55:14,550 --> 00:55:17,590
Well, they asked me who would...

776
00:55:17,690 --> 00:55:20,210
who I'd be willing to c...

777
00:55:20,310 --> 00:55:21,710
I know.

778
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:23,590
And thank you.

779
00:55:23,690 --> 00:55:25,480
- Thank you very much.
<i>- Bueno.</i>

780
00:55:40,870 --> 00:55:44,310
<i>Sí</i>. Uh-huh.

781
00:55:44,410 --> 00:55:46,250
Okay. Uh-huh.

782
00:55:53,130 --> 00:55:54,830
I've got to find Raymond.

783
00:55:54,930 --> 00:55:56,880
Maybe he's home by now.

784
00:55:56,980 --> 00:55:59,300
All right, darling.
Whatever you want.

785
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:02,300
But first, I have something to tell you.

786
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:05,510
You know what I was doing when
you so cleverly had the police call me?

787
00:56:05,610 --> 00:56:08,300
Don't bother trying to guess.
You're too tired.

788
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:10,470
I'll tell you what I was doing.

789
00:56:10,570 --> 00:56:12,680
After I dropped you off,

790
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:16,100
I went straight home,
and when I got upstairs...

791
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:18,190
- Apartment 3B.
- That's right.

792
00:56:18,290 --> 00:56:20,230
Very good.

793
00:56:20,330 --> 00:56:24,160
Before I even took my coat off,
I telephoned my fiancé.

794
00:56:25,830 --> 00:56:27,820
I told you I wasn't married.

795
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:30,330
I never said I wasn't engaged.

796
00:56:30,430 --> 00:56:33,040
Well, I called up my fiancé

797
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:36,250
and he came over as soon as he could,
which was instantly,

798
00:56:36,350 --> 00:56:40,040
and I told him I had just met you,
and I gave him his ring back.

799
00:56:40,140 --> 00:56:43,170
I tried to convey my regrets

800
00:56:43,270 --> 00:56:45,880
for whatever pain
I might be causing him,

801
00:56:45,980 --> 00:56:47,640
and then, just then,

802
00:56:47,740 --> 00:56:51,220
you had the police call to invite me
to meet you at the 24th Precinct.

803
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:52,810
So I grabbed my coat,

804
00:56:52,910 --> 00:56:56,480
kissed my fiancé on the cheek
for the last time in our lives we would ever kiss,

805
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:58,110
and I ran.

806
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:03,530
At the police station, they told me you had just
beaten up a very large Chinese gentleman.

807
00:57:03,630 --> 00:57:07,200
Not Chinese, dear. Korean.
At least I think he was Korean.

808
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:09,530
A very large Korean gentleman.

809
00:57:09,630 --> 00:57:12,660
But that you were a pretty solid type yourself,
according to Washington,

810
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:14,410
with whom they had apparently checked.

811
00:57:14,510 --> 00:57:16,800
So I figured if they were
willing to go to all the trouble

812
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:19,170
to get a comment on you
out of George Washington,

813
00:57:19,270 --> 00:57:21,880
why, you must be somebody
very important indeed.

814
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:25,710
And I must say it was rather sweet
of the general, with you only a major.

815
00:57:25,810 --> 00:57:28,270
I didn't even know you knew him.

816
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:33,810
If they were the tiniest bit puzzled
about you, they could've asked me.

817
00:57:34,690 --> 00:57:37,310
Oh, yes, indeed, my darling Ben,

818
00:57:37,410 --> 00:57:39,070
they could've asked me,

819
00:57:40,030 --> 00:57:42,030
and I would've told them.

820
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,780
- Hi, kid.
- What in the hell's going on?

821
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:56,850
They called me in Washington to tell me
that you'd broken into my apartment

822
00:57:56,950 --> 00:57:58,880
and beaten up my houseboy.

823
00:58:03,140 --> 00:58:04,800
Yeah, well, uh,

824
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:06,300
you see, Chunjin, when I...

825
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:08,220
My God, you look terrible.

826
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:10,680
I mean, I've never
seen you look so awful.

827
00:58:11,690 --> 00:58:12,690
Yeah.

828
00:58:28,910 --> 00:58:30,580
Raymond, uh,

829
00:58:31,870 --> 00:58:33,950
I want to tell you that I been

830
00:58:34,050 --> 00:58:36,710
having this terrible nightmare.

831
00:58:48,930 --> 00:58:51,350
I've been in the army 19 years.

832
00:58:52,230 --> 00:58:54,230
First time I've ever seen one of these.

833
00:59:00,730 --> 00:59:02,900
I've been havin' this nightmare.

834
00:59:04,110 --> 00:59:06,780
A real swinger of a nightmare too.

835
00:59:07,830 --> 00:59:11,530
It has to do with, uh,
all kinds of strange people.

836
00:59:11,630 --> 00:59:14,620
Is it about a Russian general
and some Chinese

837
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:17,380
and me and the men
who were on the patrol?

838
00:59:18,380 --> 00:59:21,580
How did you know that?
How do <i>you</i> know?

839
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:23,840
Take your hands off me.

840
00:59:26,050 --> 00:59:27,720
Please, Raymond.

841
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:31,060
Tell me.
How did you know?

842
00:59:32,310 --> 00:59:35,670
- I don't really know anything about it at all.
- But you just started to tell me...

843
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:37,760
You remember Al Melvin?

844
00:59:37,860 --> 00:59:39,740
- The corporal in the patrol?
- Yes, of course.

845
00:59:39,870 --> 00:59:42,520
Well, I had a letter from him
a couple of weeks ago.

846
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:45,900
Needless to say,
I was very surprised to hear from him.

847
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,520
You know how much the guys
in the outfit hated me.

848
00:59:48,620 --> 00:59:50,530
Not as much as I hated them,
of course.

849
00:59:50,630 --> 00:59:53,570
Well, anyway, the funny thing was,

850
00:59:53,670 --> 00:59:56,960
he said in his letter that I was
the best friend he had in the army.

851
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:00,870
<i>I</i> was the best friend
he had in the army.

852
01:00:00,970 --> 01:00:02,870
Why, the poor, simple boob.

853
01:00:02,970 --> 01:00:05,710
Anyway, that's what he wanted to tell me...
about his nightmare.

854
01:00:05,810 --> 01:00:08,970
- He said he was going out of his mind.
- Raymond.

855
01:00:10,180 --> 01:00:12,710
Tell me what he said
about the nightmare.

856
01:00:12,810 --> 01:00:16,390
Well, he keeps dreaming that the patrol
is all sitting together in this hotel lobby,

857
01:00:16,490 --> 01:00:20,810
and there are a lot of Chinese brass
and Russian generals and I don't know.

858
01:00:20,910 --> 01:00:23,060
Anyway, what's so much
of a nightmare about that?

859
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:25,810
The letter.
Have you got the letter?

860
01:00:25,910 --> 01:00:28,320
No, I don't.
I never keep letters.

861
01:00:29,110 --> 01:00:31,650
That's all he wrote?
That was the end of it?

862
01:00:31,750 --> 01:00:34,240
Why? Is it the same thing
that you've been dreaming?

863
01:00:34,340 --> 01:00:36,740
Raymond,
do something for me, will you?

864
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:39,660
Call Eldorado 5-9970.

865
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:42,910
If a young lady answers, and she will,
tell her I've gone to Washington.

866
01:00:43,010 --> 01:00:44,580
The town, not the general.

867
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:47,000
Tell her I'll be in touch with her
as quickly as I can.

868
01:00:47,100 --> 01:00:50,340
You'll do that, won't you?
Eldorado 5-9970.

869
01:00:57,690 --> 01:01:00,760
To take some of the mystery
out of it, Major,

870
01:01:00,860 --> 01:01:03,930
the photographs you're looking at
are shots of male models,

871
01:01:04,030 --> 01:01:08,440
Mexican circus performers,
Czech research chemists,

872
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:12,360
Japanese criminals,
French headwaiters,

873
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:15,690
Turkish wrestlers,
pastoral psychiatrists

874
01:01:15,790 --> 01:01:21,290
and, of course, various officials of the USSR,
the People's Republic of China

875
01:01:21,830 --> 01:01:23,500
and the Soviet Army.

876
01:01:25,590 --> 01:01:28,550
- Hold the one on the right, please.
- Hold that one.

877
01:01:41,850 --> 01:01:43,360
Hold this one too, please.

878
01:01:48,650 --> 01:01:50,440
Exactly one hour ago,

879
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:53,110
your friend, Mr. Alan Melvin,
in Wainright, Alaska,

880
01:01:53,210 --> 01:01:54,910
made the same two photographs.

881
01:01:58,580 --> 01:02:01,580
This one here wore sunglasses.
Smelled like a goat.

882
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:06,200
His mustache was a little thinner then.

883
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:08,250
He had a loud voice and it grated.

884
01:02:08,350 --> 01:02:11,540
He's about 5'11",
on the heavy side.

885
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:13,890
Uniformed as a lieutenant general.

886
01:02:15,100 --> 01:02:18,510
His staff were dressed in civilian clothes.
They looked a little like FBI men.

887
01:02:18,610 --> 01:02:21,180
His name, incidentally, is Berezovo.

888
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:23,270
He's a member
of the central committee.

889
01:02:24,690 --> 01:02:28,100
This one was dressed in civilian clothes,
but his staff was uniformed,

890
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:31,440
bearing from a full colonel
to a first lieutenant.

891
01:02:31,540 --> 01:02:33,190
They wore political markings.

892
01:02:33,290 --> 01:02:34,690
Lights.

893
01:02:41,710 --> 01:02:43,490
All right, Ben.

894
01:02:43,590 --> 01:02:48,620
I'm going to recommend setting up
a joint intelligence CIA-FBI unit

895
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:50,330
based out of New York.

896
01:02:50,430 --> 01:02:52,920
You'll work with them,
representing the army.

897
01:02:53,020 --> 01:02:55,960
- Your assignment's Raymond Shaw.
- Very good, Colonel.

898
01:02:56,060 --> 01:02:58,590
Should be a very pleasant
assignment, Major,

899
01:02:58,690 --> 01:03:01,050
considering that Raymond Shaw

900
01:03:01,150 --> 01:03:03,680
is the kindest, bravest, warmest,

901
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:07,270
most wonderful human being
you've ever met in your life.

902
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:14,110
My mother, Ben,
is a terrible woman.

903
01:03:15,070 --> 01:03:17,910
A terrible, terrible woman.

904
01:03:22,330 --> 01:03:23,930
Chunjin.

905
01:03:24,340 --> 01:03:26,830
Chunjin.
We would like some more wine.

906
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:30,100
Chunjin!

907
01:03:30,930 --> 01:03:32,910
Oh, I forgot.

908
01:03:33,010 --> 01:03:35,880
After you called,
I... I gave Chunjin the night off.

909
01:03:35,980 --> 01:03:37,750
<i>~ On the first day of Christmas ~</i>

910
01:03:37,850 --> 01:03:40,210
Because it was Christmas Eve,
I told him.

911
01:03:40,310 --> 01:03:42,260
He was very reluctant to go.

912
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:44,430
<i>~ A partridge in a pear tree ~</i>

913
01:03:44,530 --> 01:03:47,390
That's probably because he's a Buddhist
and he doesn't celebrate Christmas.

914
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:48,560
Uh-uh.

915
01:03:48,950 --> 01:03:52,600
I don't think that Chunjin is a Buddhist.

916
01:03:52,700 --> 01:03:55,230
Well, he smiles all the time.

917
01:03:55,330 --> 01:03:57,270
Oh, what a shame.

918
01:03:57,370 --> 01:03:59,190
I thought he was a Buddhist.

919
01:03:59,290 --> 01:04:01,940
Otherwise I would have sent him
a Christmas card.

920
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:03,870
But I figured

921
01:04:05,830 --> 01:04:09,380
that if I sent him a card
at this time of the year,

922
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:15,750
then he would have to send me
a card on the Buddha's birthday.

923
01:04:15,850 --> 01:04:17,710
- To save face, right?
- Oh, right.

924
01:04:17,810 --> 01:04:19,920
And that would have started
a whole big megillah.

925
01:04:20,020 --> 01:04:21,510
- Exactly.
- All right.

926
01:04:21,610 --> 01:04:25,430
That's what...
You did exactly the right thing.

927
01:04:25,530 --> 01:04:27,590
<i>~ Two turtle doves ~</i>

928
01:04:27,690 --> 01:04:30,140
<i>~ And a partridge in a pear tree ~</i>

929
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:32,820
Twelve days of Christmas.

930
01:04:34,230 --> 01:04:37,200
One day of Christmas
is loathsome enough.

931
01:04:39,660 --> 01:04:42,070
What were we saying?
Oh, yes, my mother.

932
01:04:42,170 --> 01:04:45,320
Oh, but you don't want to sit there,
listening to me talking about my mother.

933
01:04:45,420 --> 01:04:47,580
Of course I do. I'm interested.

934
01:04:48,370 --> 01:04:53,540
It's rather like listening to Orestes
gripe about Clytemnestra.

935
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:55,290
- Who?
- Greeks.

936
01:04:55,390 --> 01:04:57,330
- A couple of Greeks in a play.
- Oh.

937
01:04:57,430 --> 01:04:59,460
Well, you know, Ben,

938
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:02,670
it's a terrible thing to hate your mother.

939
01:05:02,770 --> 01:05:05,130
But I didn't always hate her.

940
01:05:05,230 --> 01:05:09,190
No. When I was a child,
I... I only kind of disliked her.

941
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:14,220
But after what she did to Jocie and me,

942
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:17,520
that's when I began to hate her.

943
01:05:17,620 --> 01:05:18,820
Jocie?

944
01:05:19,580 --> 01:05:21,490
Jocie Jordan.

945
01:05:22,620 --> 01:05:25,860
- Senator Jordan's daughter.
- Hmm.

946
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:28,250
That's pretty funny, isn't it?

947
01:05:31,880 --> 01:05:34,290
Thomas Jordan's daughter

948
01:05:35,550 --> 01:05:38,590
and Johnny Iselin's stepson.

949
01:05:44,140 --> 01:05:45,640
That's her.

950
01:05:47,980 --> 01:05:49,180
Jocie.

951
01:05:51,690 --> 01:05:54,860
- She's lovely.
- I always keep her picture.

952
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:05,780
Years later, I realized, Ben,
that I am not very lovable.

953
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:08,030
No, no, don't contradict me.

954
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:10,240
I am not lovable.

955
01:06:10,340 --> 01:06:14,200
Some people are lovable,
and other people are not lovable.

956
01:06:14,300 --> 01:06:16,960
I am not lovable.

957
01:06:19,340 --> 01:06:22,260
Oh, but I was very lovable with Jocie.

958
01:06:23,340 --> 01:06:26,680
Ben, you cannot believe
how lovable I was.

959
01:06:27,510 --> 01:06:29,270
In a way.

960
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:33,230
And, of course,
my mother fixed all that.

961
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:39,810
Ben, you don't blame me
for hating my mother, do you?

962
01:06:39,910 --> 01:06:42,560
I'm not making excuses,

963
01:06:42,660 --> 01:06:49,540
but I have been even less lovable
than I was since.

964
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:56,620
It was the summer
just before I went into the army.

965
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:59,380
And I was bitten by this snake.

966
01:07:02,220 --> 01:07:03,670
Are you following me?

967
01:07:03,770 --> 01:07:04,770
I am.

968
01:07:05,850 --> 01:07:10,220
Well, while I was lying there,
absolutely helpless,

969
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:13,340
afraid to move...
because you're not supposed to move.

970
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:17,730
It-It makes the poison circulate.

971
01:07:20,030 --> 01:07:23,230
When unexpectedly,

972
01:07:23,330 --> 01:07:27,440
there she was with a razor blade
in her hand.

973
01:07:27,540 --> 01:07:30,150
My daddy's going to be
so pleased about this.

974
01:07:30,250 --> 01:07:34,070
I mean, he's just absolutely scared tiddly
about snakes in this part of the country.

975
01:07:34,170 --> 01:07:36,580
I know that sounds
terribly Freudian and everything,

976
01:07:36,680 --> 01:07:38,580
but in this case, I don't think it is.

977
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:42,460
I mean, I think he's just simply and
uncomplicatedly afraid of snakes, period.

978
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:45,540
Which is why I happen to be
riding around with a razor blade

979
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:49,210
and a bottle of
potassium permanganate solution.

980
01:07:49,310 --> 01:07:51,670
You don't happen to have
a handkerchief, do you?

981
01:07:51,770 --> 01:07:53,840
Oh, no, of course you don't.

982
01:07:53,940 --> 01:07:56,050
Well, I don't either.

983
01:07:56,150 --> 01:07:58,930
I do have a Kleenex, but...

984
01:07:59,030 --> 01:08:00,470
Oh, well.

985
01:08:00,570 --> 01:08:04,780
Seriously, Daddy is going
to be just thrilled about this.

986
01:08:06,450 --> 01:08:10,610
All summer long he's been raving about
snakes, and nobody's even seen one.

987
01:08:10,710 --> 01:08:12,690
And now this.

988
01:08:12,790 --> 01:08:15,740
I promise you one thing.
It may be a little uncomfortable for you.

989
01:08:15,840 --> 01:08:18,200
But it's going to absolutely
make his summer.

990
01:08:18,300 --> 01:08:20,580
Now you just lie very still.
Don't move.

991
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:24,130
That's very important.
I'll be right back with the car in a minute.

992
01:08:34,390 --> 01:08:36,220
You're lucky, young man, very lucky.

993
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:41,150
If I were to tell you the statistics
on death by snakebite every year...

994
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:44,770
But in this case, I... I think...

995
01:08:44,870 --> 01:08:47,490
Oh, there's no swelling above or below.

996
01:08:48,530 --> 01:08:49,530
Hmm.

997
01:08:56,200 --> 01:08:57,600
Normal.

998
01:08:58,010 --> 01:09:01,420
Well, I must say, there's a good chance
you're going to live.

999
01:09:04,210 --> 01:09:07,090
You are not, by any chance,
a mute, are you?

1000
01:09:09,840 --> 01:09:12,260
- No, sir.
- Oh. Well.

1001
01:09:13,850 --> 01:09:16,510
I want to thank you very much,
Miss... Miss...

1002
01:09:16,610 --> 01:09:20,050
- Jordan.
- Miss Jocelyn Jordan.

1003
01:09:20,150 --> 01:09:22,020
- How do you do?
- Hi.

1004
01:09:24,110 --> 01:09:27,640
And now, according
to the quaint local custom,

1005
01:09:27,740 --> 01:09:29,980
it's your turn to tell us
what your name is.

1006
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:31,770
My name is Raymond Shaw, sir.

1007
01:09:31,870 --> 01:09:35,150
How do you do, Raymond?
Is your place near here, Raymond?

1008
01:09:35,250 --> 01:09:38,280
Yes. It's that red house
just across the lake.

1009
01:09:38,380 --> 01:09:41,070
- The Iselin house?
- My house.

1010
01:09:41,170 --> 01:09:44,160
It was my father's.
My father's dead. He left it to me.

1011
01:09:44,260 --> 01:09:48,120
We were told that that was
the summer camp of Senator Iselin.

1012
01:09:48,220 --> 01:09:50,750
Johnny stays there sometimes, sir.

1013
01:09:50,850 --> 01:09:54,220
When he gets too drunk for my mother
to allow him to be seen in Washington.

1014
01:09:57,180 --> 01:10:00,590
My dear, although we've done everything
that modern science recommends,

1015
01:10:00,690 --> 01:10:03,890
there is still the traditional folk remedy
against snakebite

1016
01:10:03,990 --> 01:10:05,930
which we haven't applied,

1017
01:10:06,030 --> 01:10:08,190
so to be on the safe side...

1018
01:10:11,570 --> 01:10:13,240
Mrs. Iselin is your mother?

1019
01:10:13,910 --> 01:10:15,410
Yes, sir.

1020
01:10:17,910 --> 01:10:20,320
I once found it necessary
to sue your mother

1021
01:10:20,420 --> 01:10:24,120
for defamation of character
and slander.

1022
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:27,750
My name is Thomas Jordan.
Senator Thomas Jordan.

1023
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:30,420
The Communist?

1024
01:10:31,680 --> 01:10:37,010
Well, one of your mother's
more endearing traits

1025
01:10:37,110 --> 01:10:40,630
is her tendency to refer to anyone
who disagrees with her about anything

1026
01:10:40,730 --> 01:10:42,520
as a Communist.

1027
01:10:43,020 --> 01:10:46,850
The last time she so referred to me
on a network radio program,

1028
01:10:46,950 --> 01:10:51,400
it cost her $65,000 and court costs.

1029
01:10:52,530 --> 01:10:55,360
What hurt her more than the money,
I think,

1030
01:10:55,460 --> 01:10:58,320
was the fact that I donated all of it
to an organization

1031
01:10:58,420 --> 01:11:01,580
called the American Civil Liberties Union.

1032
01:11:04,620 --> 01:11:06,120
Senator Jordan?

1033
01:11:06,220 --> 01:11:08,040
Yes, Raymond.

1034
01:11:09,880 --> 01:11:13,130
I would very much like to ask
your permission, sir, to marry Jocelyn.

1035
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:34,740
We were together every minute
after that.

1036
01:11:39,580 --> 01:11:42,240
You just cannot believe, Ben,

1037
01:11:42,340 --> 01:11:45,040
how lovable the whole damn thing was.

1038
01:11:47,670 --> 01:11:49,840
All summer long we were together.

1039
01:11:52,380 --> 01:11:54,050
I was lovable.

1040
01:11:55,590 --> 01:11:57,510
Jocie was lovable.

1041
01:11:58,720 --> 01:12:00,920
The senator was lovable.

1042
01:12:01,020 --> 01:12:03,680
The days were lovable,
the nights were lovable.

1043
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:08,940
And everybody was lovable

1044
01:12:11,570 --> 01:12:15,400
except, of course, my mother.

1045
01:12:18,070 --> 01:12:19,570
Raymond?

1046
01:12:22,490 --> 01:12:24,280
What is it, Mother?

1047
01:12:24,380 --> 01:12:26,660
What sort of a greeting is that
at 3:30 in the morning?

1048
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:28,660
It's a quarter to 3:00,
and what do you want?

1049
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:31,080
I want to talk to you, Raymond.

1050
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:32,790
About what?

1051
01:12:32,890 --> 01:12:35,010
I would like to talk to you
about that Communist tart.

1052
01:12:35,110 --> 01:12:36,830
Shut up with that, Mother!
Shut up!

1053
01:12:36,930 --> 01:12:40,040
Do you know what Jordan is?
Are you out to crucify me, to crucify Johnny?

1054
01:12:40,140 --> 01:12:42,600
I don't know what you're talking about,
and I don't want to know.

1055
01:12:42,700 --> 01:12:44,630
- I'm going to bed.
- Raymond.

1056
01:12:44,730 --> 01:12:46,310
Sit down.

1057
01:12:57,280 --> 01:12:59,810
How would you see her?
They live in New York.

1058
01:12:59,910 --> 01:13:01,940
I'm getting a job in New York.

1059
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:03,740
You have your army service.

1060
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:05,320
Next spring.

1061
01:13:05,420 --> 01:13:07,820
I might be dead by next spring.

1062
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:10,990
Raymond, if we were at war

1063
01:13:11,090 --> 01:13:15,120
and you were suddenly to become infatuated
with the daughter of a Russian agent,

1064
01:13:15,220 --> 01:13:17,710
wouldn't you expect me
to come to you and object

1065
01:13:17,810 --> 01:13:21,340
and beg you to stop the entire thing
before it was too late?

1066
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:23,340
Well, we are at war.

1067
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:27,180
It's a cold war,
but it will get worse and worse

1068
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:29,760
until every man, woman and child
in this country

1069
01:13:29,860 --> 01:13:31,760
will have to stand up and be counted

1070
01:13:31,860 --> 01:13:34,390
and say whether they are on the side
of right and freedom

1071
01:13:34,490 --> 01:13:37,730
or on the side of the Thomas Jordans
of this country.

1072
01:13:37,830 --> 01:13:40,730
I will go with you to Washington.
Tomorrow, if you like.

1073
01:13:40,830 --> 01:13:44,150
And I will show you documented proof
that this man stands for evil,

1074
01:13:44,250 --> 01:13:47,320
that he is evil
and that his whole life was devoted

1075
01:13:47,420 --> 01:13:50,990
to undermining everything
that you and I and Johnny

1076
01:13:51,090 --> 01:13:53,030
and every freedom-minded American...

1077
01:13:53,130 --> 01:13:55,790
She won, of course.

1078
01:13:55,890 --> 01:13:58,010
She always does.

1079
01:13:59,010 --> 01:14:00,970
I could never beat her.

1080
01:14:02,930 --> 01:14:04,800
I still can't.

1081
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:11,350
I wrote a letter.

1082
01:14:12,440 --> 01:14:16,110
Or she wrote it and I signed it.
I-I can't even remember which.

1083
01:14:18,650 --> 01:14:23,820
It was a terrible, vile, disgusting letter.

1084
01:14:29,870 --> 01:14:32,170
The next day I enlisted in the army

1085
01:14:35,750 --> 01:14:37,840
and I never saw her again.

1086
01:14:40,260 --> 01:14:42,630
God knows, Ben, I...

1087
01:14:43,680 --> 01:14:45,640
I'm not lovable,

1088
01:14:47,180 --> 01:14:49,920
but I loved her.

1089
01:14:50,020 --> 01:14:52,090
I did love her.

1090
01:14:52,190 --> 01:14:54,520
I <i>do</i> love her.

1091
01:15:02,530 --> 01:15:04,110
Come on, kid.

1092
01:15:04,210 --> 01:15:06,990
It's time for you to call it a night.
Come on.

1093
01:15:11,660 --> 01:15:16,120
So this lousy brother-in-law of mine,
I say to him, "You think you're a poker player?

1094
01:15:16,220 --> 01:15:19,880
Well, I got a flash for you.
You ain't no poker player."

1095
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:23,830
So I says to him,

1096
01:15:23,930 --> 01:15:27,960
"My advice to you,
from the bottom of the heart...

1097
01:15:28,060 --> 01:15:30,060
Don't play poker.

1098
01:15:31,270 --> 01:15:36,140
If I was you, I'd get myself
another line of action.

1099
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:40,930
Why don't you pass the time
by playing a little solitaire?"

1100
01:15:41,030 --> 01:15:43,990
- So he says to me...
- I need a deck of cards, please.

1101
01:15:52,160 --> 01:15:54,320
When I get married to my old lady,

1102
01:15:54,420 --> 01:15:58,490
I got no idea that this guy comes
in the same package,

1103
01:15:58,590 --> 01:16:00,580
that it's a package deal.

1104
01:16:00,680 --> 01:16:05,330
And for 11 long years,
I got this crumb tied around my neck.

1105
01:16:05,430 --> 01:16:07,790
And believe me, it's no bargain.

1106
01:16:07,890 --> 01:16:10,340
You got no idea what kind
of a problem I got with this guy.

1107
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:12,840
Beer, please.
Sorry I'm late, kid.

1108
01:16:12,940 --> 01:16:15,090
Got held up in traffic, you know?

1109
01:16:15,190 --> 01:16:18,300
So, I says to him,
"Please, do me a favor, will you?

1110
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:20,260
Why don't you go
and take yourself a cab

1111
01:16:20,360 --> 01:16:24,530
and go up to Central Park
and go jump in the lake?"

1112
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:30,230
Hey. Raymond!

1113
01:16:30,330 --> 01:16:31,330
Hey.

1114
01:16:38,290 --> 01:16:39,790
Raymond.

1115
01:18:11,550 --> 01:18:13,550
Get out of there.

1116
01:18:14,850 --> 01:18:16,850
What are you doing?

1117
01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:21,640
- Hi, Ben.
- What the hell are you doing?

1118
01:18:21,740 --> 01:18:23,390
What's the matter with you?

1119
01:18:23,490 --> 01:18:25,020
I don't know.

1120
01:18:26,520 --> 01:18:29,620
I was standing next to you at the bar,
and you were playing a game of solitaire.

1121
01:18:29,720 --> 01:18:31,400
Do you remember that?

1122
01:18:33,570 --> 01:18:36,530
Then you bolted out of the bar,
jumped in a cab, drove up here to the park

1123
01:18:36,670 --> 01:18:38,150
and jumped into the water.

1124
01:18:38,250 --> 01:18:42,080
I don't remember, Ben.
I just don't remember.

1125
01:18:42,750 --> 01:18:46,620
Wait a minute. I do. I remember.

1126
01:18:46,720 --> 01:18:48,660
In the dream.

1127
01:18:48,760 --> 01:18:51,470
I remember what you were doing
with your hands.

1128
01:18:52,340 --> 01:18:54,340
You were...

1129
01:18:54,440 --> 01:18:56,050
Of course.

1130
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:02,800
Obviously the solitaire game serves
as some kind of trigger mechanism.

1131
01:19:02,900 --> 01:19:05,310
Black seven on the red eight.

1132
01:19:07,980 --> 01:19:12,350
I suggest we discard the various number
systems and concentrate on the face cards.

1133
01:19:12,450 --> 01:19:14,900
- Red six on the black seven.
- Thanks a lot.

1134
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:18,440
Because of their symbolic identification
with human beings.

1135
01:19:18,540 --> 01:19:20,650
Based on Raymond's
psychiatric pattern,

1136
01:19:20,750 --> 01:19:23,490
I think we can safely eliminate
jacks and kings.

1137
01:19:23,590 --> 01:19:26,030
Black six on the red seven.

1138
01:19:26,130 --> 01:19:28,460
Why don't you try it for a while?

1139
01:19:31,130 --> 01:19:34,040
Human fish swimming at the bottom
of the great ocean of atmosphere

1140
01:19:34,140 --> 01:19:38,460
develop psychic injuries
as they collide with one another.

1141
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:43,480
Most mortal of all
are those gotten from the parent fish.

1142
01:19:44,890 --> 01:19:47,150
Queen of diamonds on the black king.

1143
01:19:49,690 --> 01:19:51,810
Hey, what are you doing?

1144
01:19:51,910 --> 01:19:53,980
To cheat at solitaire
is a form of regression that...

1145
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:56,060
I remember.

1146
01:19:56,160 --> 01:19:57,660
I remember.

1147
01:19:59,870 --> 01:20:04,570
I can see that Chinese cat
standin' there smilin' like Fu Manchu

1148
01:20:04,670 --> 01:20:06,700
and saying,

1149
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:11,040
"The queen of diamonds
is reminiscent in many ways

1150
01:20:11,140 --> 01:20:14,220
of Raymond's dearly loved
and hated mother

1151
01:20:15,550 --> 01:20:19,800
and is the second key
to clear the mechanism

1152
01:20:19,900 --> 01:20:22,420
for any other assignment."

1153
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:23,520
Yeah.

1154
01:20:25,810 --> 01:20:29,010
"...our great republic...
repeat 'republic'...

1155
01:20:29,110 --> 01:20:32,390
until the peril of international Communism
is driven

1156
01:20:32,490 --> 01:20:35,450
from every dark corner
of this great nation."

1157
01:20:36,450 --> 01:20:39,190
Getting a little chucky on the chin.
You know what I mean?

1158
01:20:39,290 --> 01:20:41,940
You know, hon, I can't tell you
how worried I am about Raymond.

1159
01:20:42,040 --> 01:20:43,530
Raymond? What Raymond?

1160
01:20:43,630 --> 01:20:46,780
Raymond Shaw.
My son. Your stepson.

1161
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:49,990
I've been thinking about him a great deal lately,
and you know what I've decided?

1162
01:20:50,090 --> 01:20:51,950
- No.
- I've decided it's time he got married.

1163
01:20:52,050 --> 01:20:53,050
Hmm.

1164
01:20:54,310 --> 01:20:57,120
May I ask what you find so amusing?

1165
01:20:57,220 --> 01:21:01,090
Who could you possibly find
who would marry Raymond?

1166
01:21:01,190 --> 01:21:04,510
I have devoted considerable thought
to the problem,

1167
01:21:04,610 --> 01:21:08,340
and it has occurred to me
that Tom Jordan's daughter Jocelyn...

1168
01:21:08,440 --> 01:21:09,930
You remember her, hon?

1169
01:21:10,030 --> 01:21:13,600
That mousy little girl Raymond was
so attracted to that summer at the lake.

1170
01:21:13,700 --> 01:21:16,230
Oh, yeah, that little Communist tart?

1171
01:21:16,330 --> 01:21:18,330
All right.

1172
01:21:18,540 --> 01:21:21,390
- So I might have been a little bit hasty.
- A little in the hairline here.

1173
01:21:21,490 --> 01:21:24,610
Anyway, times change. I now think she
would make Raymond an excellent wife.

1174
01:21:24,710 --> 01:21:27,200
She's been living in Paris
for the past two years.

1175
01:21:27,300 --> 01:21:29,410
I have word
she'll be coming home soon.

1176
01:21:29,510 --> 01:21:33,250
And when she does,
I think we should give a little party.

1177
01:21:33,960 --> 01:21:36,620
But, babe, I thought
that you and Senator Jordan...

1178
01:21:36,720 --> 01:21:39,880
I keep telling you not to think.

1179
01:21:39,980 --> 01:21:42,340
You're very, very good
at a great many things,

1180
01:21:42,440 --> 01:21:45,840
but thinking, hon,
just simply isn't one of them.

1181
01:21:45,940 --> 01:21:49,930
You just keep shouting, "Point of order,
point of order" into the television cameras,

1182
01:21:50,030 --> 01:21:51,680
and I'll handle the rest.

1183
01:21:51,780 --> 01:21:53,220
Jimmy. Bourbon and water.

1184
01:21:53,320 --> 01:21:56,270
I think a June wedding would be nice,

1185
01:21:56,370 --> 01:21:58,860
right before the convention.

1186
01:22:00,570 --> 01:22:03,860
Raymond, I don't know why yours
is the only apartment in New York City

1187
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:05,440
without an air conditioner.

1188
01:22:05,540 --> 01:22:08,700
Sometimes I think you came to us
from another century.

1189
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:11,030
Chu Chin Chow,
or whatever your name is,

1190
01:22:11,130 --> 01:22:13,740
the steaks are to be broiled
for exactly 11 minutes.

1191
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:17,710
No more, no less, on each side
in a preheated grill at 400 degrees.

1192
01:22:17,810 --> 01:22:19,250
Yes, ma'am.

1193
01:22:19,350 --> 01:22:21,500
- Raymond?
- Mother?

1194
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:24,750
- May I ask a question?
- Of course.

1195
01:22:24,850 --> 01:22:26,460
What are you doing here?

1196
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:28,880
I mean, why are we having
our annual meeting?

1197
01:22:28,980 --> 01:22:30,930
I don't know what you're talking about.

1198
01:22:31,030 --> 01:22:33,750
Well, when I got your message
announcing that you were coming to lunch,

1199
01:22:33,850 --> 01:22:36,180
I naturally assumed it was
because you wanted something.

1200
01:22:36,280 --> 01:22:38,730
Not at all.
This is a purely social event.

1201
01:22:38,830 --> 01:22:40,940
- However...
- Ah.

1202
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:42,690
The "however."

1203
01:22:42,790 --> 01:22:46,820
As you may or may not have heard,
Johnny and I are giving an enormous party.

1204
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:50,820
A costume ball, actually,
at the summer house on Long Island.

1205
01:22:50,920 --> 01:22:53,170
I wondered if you'd like to attend.

1206
01:22:54,790 --> 01:22:56,840
Have you gone out of your mind?

1207
01:22:57,880 --> 01:23:01,670
The reason I ask is because we're giving it
in honor of an old friend of yours

1208
01:23:01,770 --> 01:23:03,420
and her father.

1209
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:05,010
What old friend?

1210
01:23:06,140 --> 01:23:09,420
Do you remember a darling girl we met
the summer before you went into the army...

1211
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:12,430
Jocelyn Jordan,
Senator Jordan's daughter?

1212
01:23:12,530 --> 01:23:15,270
Well, she's been living abroad
for the last several years.

1213
01:23:16,060 --> 01:23:18,890
She arrived back in New York
a week or so ago.

1214
01:23:18,990 --> 01:23:20,560
And I thought,

1215
01:23:20,660 --> 01:23:23,480
considering the rather shabby way
you treated her,

1216
01:23:23,580 --> 01:23:28,200
it might be a rather gracious gesture
if I gave her a coming home party.

1217
01:23:29,830 --> 01:23:31,660
Jocie and her father...

1218
01:23:34,210 --> 01:23:35,870
coming to a party of yours?

1219
01:23:35,970 --> 01:23:37,280
Of course.

1220
01:23:37,380 --> 01:23:39,630
Once I explained to her
you would be there.

1221
01:23:47,890 --> 01:23:50,840
It's all right. It's Polish caviar.

1222
01:23:50,940 --> 01:23:53,270
- Johnny? Come over here, hon.
- Hmm?

1223
01:23:55,230 --> 01:23:58,060
Come on, get a picture. Quick.

1224
01:23:59,860 --> 01:24:01,360
You stand in the middle.

1225
01:24:04,610 --> 01:24:07,240
- Great. You look marvelous.
- Thank you. See you later.

1226
01:24:11,950 --> 01:24:15,160
- Where is she? Have they come?
- They'll be here any minute.

1227
01:24:15,260 --> 01:24:17,680
Are you sure they're coming, Mother?
Are you absolutely sure?

1228
01:24:17,780 --> 01:24:19,490
Oh, Raymond, don't be such a jerk.

1229
01:24:19,590 --> 01:24:22,710
Go and get yourself a drink
or a tranquilizer or something.

1230
01:24:23,260 --> 01:24:25,170
Raymond can certainly be a royal pain.

1231
01:24:25,270 --> 01:24:30,000
Ah, she's just kiddin'.
Ray, you look great. Look just great.

1232
01:24:30,100 --> 01:24:32,820
What are... What are you supposed to be,
one of those Dutch skaters?

1233
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:36,100
Raymond, darling.

1234
01:24:37,900 --> 01:24:39,890
Raymond, dear, why do you
always have to look

1235
01:24:39,990 --> 01:24:42,560
as if your head's just about
to come to a point?

1236
01:24:42,660 --> 01:24:45,350
Now just be patient,
and she'll be here.

1237
01:24:45,450 --> 01:24:47,360
I guarantee it.

1238
01:24:49,030 --> 01:24:52,650
Raymond, why don't we just
sneak away for a few minutes

1239
01:24:52,750 --> 01:24:55,120
and sit down somewhere quietly
and have a drink?

1240
01:24:56,870 --> 01:24:58,990
Are you absolutely sure
she's coming, Mother?

1241
01:24:59,090 --> 01:25:03,750
I told you, she telephoned me
20 minutes ago from the hotel.

1242
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:08,380
Mother... Mother, how did she sound?

1243
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:10,430
Like a girl.

1244
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:13,100
Raymond.

1245
01:25:14,310 --> 01:25:17,640
Why don't you pass the time
by playing a little solitaire?

1246
01:25:19,810 --> 01:25:20,810
Tom!

1247
01:25:22,570 --> 01:25:25,560
Oh, Tom. Oh, Tom, boy.

1248
01:25:25,660 --> 01:25:28,480
Tom boy, so great you could come.

1249
01:25:28,580 --> 01:25:31,570
I am here at this fascist rally

1250
01:25:31,670 --> 01:25:33,690
because my daughter has assured me

1251
01:25:33,790 --> 01:25:37,490
that it was important to her happiness
that I come.

1252
01:25:37,590 --> 01:25:39,570
There is no other reason.

1253
01:25:39,670 --> 01:25:41,630
Good old Tom.

1254
01:25:47,550 --> 01:25:49,150
Raymond?

1255
01:25:49,430 --> 01:25:53,420
The time has come for us
to have a serious discussion.

1256
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:55,260
We feel...

1257
01:25:55,360 --> 01:25:57,720
- What is it?
- It's me, babe. Johnny.

1258
01:25:57,820 --> 01:25:59,470
Tom Jordan's here. I need you.

1259
01:25:59,570 --> 01:26:01,140
I'll be right out.

1260
01:26:01,240 --> 01:26:03,970
- Who's in there with you, anyway?
- Raymond.

1261
01:26:04,070 --> 01:26:07,740
Well, hurry it up, will you?
We've got work to do out here.

1262
01:26:11,740 --> 01:26:13,650
I'll take this one with me, dear.

1263
01:26:13,750 --> 01:26:16,110
It might be mischief if I leave it.

1264
01:26:16,210 --> 01:26:17,700
Yes, Mother.

1265
01:26:21,420 --> 01:26:23,670
I'll be back as soon as I can.

1266
01:26:40,180 --> 01:26:42,930
I've been watching you
through the window.

1267
01:26:43,030 --> 01:26:46,720
When I saw you,
my heart almost shot out of my body.

1268
01:26:46,820 --> 01:26:49,480
I sent Daddy around the front way.

1269
01:26:49,580 --> 01:26:51,740
I had to see you alone.

1270
01:26:57,330 --> 01:26:58,530
Jocie.

1271
01:27:01,290 --> 01:27:02,960
Oh, Jocie.

1272
01:27:17,680 --> 01:27:19,680
He's got it!

1273
01:27:39,030 --> 01:27:41,030
Thank you.

1274
01:27:41,460 --> 01:27:43,530
Come on, lover.

1275
01:27:43,630 --> 01:27:47,830
Why don't you just take that somewhere
very quietly and drink it?

1276
01:27:47,930 --> 01:27:49,370
But, babe, I...

1277
01:27:49,470 --> 01:27:53,040
All right, dear. Run along.
The grown-ups have to talk.

1278
01:27:53,140 --> 01:27:54,140
Huh?

1279
01:28:01,850 --> 01:28:03,930
How good of you to come, Tom.

1280
01:28:04,030 --> 01:28:06,930
I have explained to your husband
why I am here.

1281
01:28:07,030 --> 01:28:10,060
Tom, I know you have
very strong personal feelings

1282
01:28:10,160 --> 01:28:12,560
about Johnny and about me.

1283
01:28:12,660 --> 01:28:16,020
What I would like to find out
is how strong they really are.

1284
01:28:16,120 --> 01:28:18,190
To put it as simply as possible,

1285
01:28:18,290 --> 01:28:21,440
if Johnny's name were put forward
at the convention next week,

1286
01:28:21,540 --> 01:28:23,530
would you attempt to block him?

1287
01:28:23,630 --> 01:28:25,280
You're joking, of course.

1288
01:28:25,380 --> 01:28:28,530
Mr. Stevenson makes jokes.
I do not.

1289
01:28:28,630 --> 01:28:31,080
You're seriously trying
for the nomination for Johnny?

1290
01:28:31,180 --> 01:28:33,410
No. We couldn't make it.

1291
01:28:33,510 --> 01:28:36,630
But I think he has a good chance
for the second spot.

1292
01:28:36,730 --> 01:28:39,460
I've answered your question,
but you haven't answered mine.

1293
01:28:39,560 --> 01:28:42,140
- What question?
- Will you block us?

1294
01:28:44,640 --> 01:28:46,560
Will I block you?

1295
01:28:47,730 --> 01:28:53,190
I would spend every cent I own
and all I could borrow to block you.

1296
01:28:55,360 --> 01:28:59,520
There are people who think of Johnny
as a clown and a buffoon,

1297
01:28:59,620 --> 01:29:01,610
but I do not.

1298
01:29:01,710 --> 01:29:07,080
I despise John Iselin and everything
that Iselinism has come to stand for.

1299
01:29:08,080 --> 01:29:11,450
I think if John Iselin
were a paid Soviet agent,

1300
01:29:11,550 --> 01:29:15,210
he could not do more to harm this country
than he is doing now.

1301
01:29:16,840 --> 01:29:21,050
You asked me a question.
Very well. I'll answer you.

1302
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:24,720
If you attempt to deal
with the delegates

1303
01:29:24,820 --> 01:29:28,300
or cause Johnny's name
to be brought forward on the ticket,

1304
01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:31,470
or if in my canvass of the delegates
tomorrow morning by telephone

1305
01:29:31,570 --> 01:29:34,310
I find that you are so acting,

1306
01:29:34,410 --> 01:29:37,440
I will bring impeachment proceedings
against your husband

1307
01:29:37,540 --> 01:29:40,440
on the floor of the United States Senate.

1308
01:29:40,540 --> 01:29:43,320
And I will hit him, I promise you,

1309
01:29:43,420 --> 01:29:47,250
with everything
in my well-documented book.

1310
01:30:09,100 --> 01:30:12,180
For one million bucks, pick a card.

1311
01:30:12,280 --> 01:30:14,600
Oh, Bennie, card tricks.
If I had known that...

1312
01:30:14,700 --> 01:30:16,690
Oh, come on. Pick a card.

1313
01:30:20,490 --> 01:30:22,490
The queen of diamonds.

1314
01:30:23,700 --> 01:30:26,200
That's pretty good.
How did you do that?

1315
01:30:27,700 --> 01:30:30,710
This is what is known, my dear girl,
as a forced deck.

1316
01:30:32,790 --> 01:30:36,240
This deck of cards is often employed
by a professional magician

1317
01:30:36,340 --> 01:30:38,370
to simplify his problem
of guessing the card

1318
01:30:38,470 --> 01:30:40,870
picked by the little old lady
in the third row.

1319
01:30:40,970 --> 01:30:44,540
Also employed
by army intelligence officers who...

1320
01:30:44,640 --> 01:30:46,130
- Rosie?
- Hmm?

1321
01:30:46,230 --> 01:30:48,590
Let's get married.

1322
01:30:48,690 --> 01:30:50,880
We certainly are in good spirits
tonight, aren't we?

1323
01:30:50,980 --> 01:30:52,890
Yes, we are.

1324
01:30:52,990 --> 01:30:54,640
Tomorrow's the big day.

1325
01:30:54,740 --> 01:30:57,220
Lunch with Raymond,
have a nice little game of solitaire

1326
01:30:57,320 --> 01:31:01,150
and a nice long chat
about the good old days in Korea.

1327
01:31:01,990 --> 01:31:04,660
And some old Chinese
and Russian friends of ours.

1328
01:31:05,740 --> 01:31:08,790
Then a suggestion or two
that'll rip out all of the wiring.

1329
01:31:10,830 --> 01:31:13,530
And then, dear girl, it's over.
All over.

1330
01:31:13,630 --> 01:31:16,080
- What's the matter? Don't you want to?
- Want to what?

1331
01:31:16,180 --> 01:31:19,620
Get married. Why don't you pay attention
to me when I speak to you?

1332
01:31:19,720 --> 01:31:24,540
Oh, Bennie, I want to marry you more
than I want to go on eating Italian food,

1333
01:31:24,640 --> 01:31:26,760
which will give you some idea.

1334
01:31:29,180 --> 01:31:31,170
Well, then why don't we
get with it, kiddo?

1335
01:31:31,270 --> 01:31:33,390
You know, arranging for the papers,
for the blood test,

1336
01:31:33,490 --> 01:31:34,890
posting the banns,

1337
01:31:34,990 --> 01:31:37,100
figure out what
we're gonna name the kids,

1338
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:39,980
renting the rice, buy the ring,
call the folks.

1339
01:31:40,080 --> 01:31:41,280
Folks?

1340
01:31:41,660 --> 01:31:43,020
- You neither?
- Mm-mmm.

1341
01:31:43,120 --> 01:31:44,270
- Orphan?
- Uh-huh.

1342
01:31:44,370 --> 01:31:47,340
I used to be convinced that as a baby
I was the soul survivor of a spaceship

1343
01:31:47,440 --> 01:31:48,900
that overshot Mars.

1344
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:50,440
Very sexy stuff.

1345
01:31:50,540 --> 01:31:53,210
Very, very sexy.

1346
01:32:04,720 --> 01:32:07,220
- Ben.
- Hello, Raymond.

1347
01:32:08,100 --> 01:32:10,920
Ben, I want...
I want you to meet Jocie.

1348
01:32:11,020 --> 01:32:14,630
Remember, I told you about her?
Uh, this is my friend, Major Ben Marco.

1349
01:32:14,730 --> 01:32:16,510
- Miss Jordan.
- How do you do, Major?

1350
01:32:16,610 --> 01:32:18,720
Only it's not Miss Jordan anymore,
it's Mrs. Shaw.

1351
01:32:18,820 --> 01:32:22,140
- Mrs. Raymond Shaw.
- We flew to Maryland last night.

1352
01:32:22,240 --> 01:32:24,350
We got married. We just got back.

1353
01:32:24,450 --> 01:32:27,650
Well, aren't you going to pop champagne,
or dance in the streets,

1354
01:32:27,750 --> 01:32:29,270
or, well, at least kiss the bride?

1355
01:32:29,370 --> 01:32:31,240
- Congratulations, Mrs. Shaw.
- Thank you, Major.

1356
01:32:31,340 --> 01:32:33,820
My God, Ben, isn't she beautiful though?
Isn't she?

1357
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:36,950
And am I not the luckiest guy in the world?
I mean, the whole world?

1358
01:32:37,050 --> 01:32:39,950
You don't have to answer that, Major.
Anyway, I'm the one who's lucky.

1359
01:32:40,050 --> 01:32:41,550
- Raymond.
- Listen, darling.

1360
01:32:42,210 --> 01:32:45,370
There must be some beer
or champagne or penicillin eyedrops

1361
01:32:45,470 --> 01:32:47,500
or some anchovies in the ice box.

1362
01:32:47,600 --> 01:32:50,710
Crack open whatever it is. The three of us,
we've absolutely got to have a drink.

1363
01:32:50,810 --> 01:32:53,010
Come on, bustle.
Make like a housewife.

1364
01:32:53,110 --> 01:32:54,840
I'll get out of this idiot suit.

1365
01:32:54,940 --> 01:32:57,680
Ben. Ben you should've seen
the judge's face.

1366
01:32:57,780 --> 01:32:59,510
There we were,
the queen of diamonds

1367
01:32:59,610 --> 01:33:02,520
and me looking like...
I don't know, like "Gaucho" Marx.

1368
01:33:04,570 --> 01:33:06,850
Gaucho Marx?

1369
01:33:06,950 --> 01:33:10,020
Ben? Ben, I just made a joke.

1370
01:33:10,120 --> 01:33:12,690
Not a very good joke,
I admit, but a joke.

1371
01:33:12,790 --> 01:33:15,850
Ben, in all the years that you've known me,
have you ever heard me make a joke?

1372
01:33:15,950 --> 01:33:18,240
Well, I just made one. Gaucho Marx.

1373
01:33:18,340 --> 01:33:19,740
Me. Ha.

1374
01:33:20,130 --> 01:33:22,040
Big day.
Mark that down in your book.

1375
01:33:22,140 --> 01:33:25,090
Raymond Shaw got married,
and he made a joke.

1376
01:33:25,880 --> 01:33:27,380
Gaucho Marx.

1377
01:33:33,470 --> 01:33:36,880
The queen of diamonds?
What did he mean, the queen of diamonds?

1378
01:33:36,980 --> 01:33:40,600
My costume. I came to this costume party
as the queen of diamonds.

1379
01:33:40,700 --> 01:33:44,300
I couldn't think what to wear, then I saw this
big playing card in a shop window on 67th...

1380
01:33:44,400 --> 01:33:47,350
- Mrs. Shaw.
- Oh, please, Major. Jocie.

1381
01:33:47,450 --> 01:33:49,400
You call me Jocie, I'll call you Ben.

1382
01:33:49,500 --> 01:33:51,370
Mrs. Shaw... Jocie,

1383
01:33:52,820 --> 01:33:56,900
the reason I came here this morning is to ask
Raymond to voluntarily put himself under arrest.

1384
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:58,000
What?

1385
01:33:58,340 --> 01:34:00,620
Well, maybe not under arrest.
That's pretty strong.

1386
01:34:00,720 --> 01:34:04,080
But to surrender himself
for some questioning.

1387
01:34:04,180 --> 01:34:06,300
Questioning?
What kind of questioning?

1388
01:34:08,010 --> 01:34:10,460
Raymond is sick, Mrs. Shaw,

1389
01:34:10,560 --> 01:34:12,750
in a kind of a special way.

1390
01:34:12,850 --> 01:34:15,800
- He doesn't even realize it himself.
- Sick? He's not sick.

1391
01:34:15,900 --> 01:34:18,110
He's the healthiest man
I've ever seen in my whole life.

1392
01:34:18,210 --> 01:34:19,820
You can tell that by just looking at him.

1393
01:34:19,920 --> 01:34:22,560
That's not the kind of sick I mean.

1394
01:34:25,020 --> 01:34:26,890
Oh, you're wrong, Ben.

1395
01:34:26,990 --> 01:34:28,980
You're wrong.

1396
01:34:29,080 --> 01:34:31,650
He's tied up inside
in a thousand knots. I know that.

1397
01:34:31,750 --> 01:34:34,700
But you can see for yourself
how he is with me.

1398
01:34:35,990 --> 01:34:37,590
Oh, God.

1399
01:34:48,420 --> 01:34:49,420
Ben,

1400
01:34:50,350 --> 01:34:52,880
we were married just six hours ago.

1401
01:34:52,980 --> 01:34:56,560
We've been in cars and offices
and airplanes ever since.

1402
01:34:58,850 --> 01:35:02,140
What were your... What are your plans?

1403
01:35:03,480 --> 01:35:06,560
Well, there's an inn,
Bedford House, near Bedford Village.

1404
01:35:06,660 --> 01:35:08,680
It's about an hour from here.

1405
01:35:08,780 --> 01:35:11,270
There's hardly anyone there
this early in the season.

1406
01:35:11,370 --> 01:35:13,360
We've already wired for a room.

1407
01:35:14,740 --> 01:35:17,150
Ben, you've got to
believe me and trust me.

1408
01:35:17,250 --> 01:35:19,410
I can make him well.

1409
01:35:20,870 --> 01:35:22,700
I'll give you 48 hours.

1410
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:25,620
You have him back here
day after tomorrow.

1411
01:35:25,720 --> 01:35:27,710
I'll talk to him then.

1412
01:35:28,710 --> 01:35:31,500
After that, we'll see.

1413
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:33,830
Oh, thank you, Ben.

1414
01:35:33,930 --> 01:35:36,010
Thank you and God bless you.

1415
01:35:44,560 --> 01:35:46,060
Darling.

1416
01:35:55,110 --> 01:35:56,110
What?

1417
01:35:57,570 --> 01:35:59,170
Nothing.

1418
01:35:59,290 --> 01:36:01,240
Just darling.

1419
01:36:13,130 --> 01:36:14,130
Mmm.

1420
01:36:17,930 --> 01:36:20,050
My dear girl,

1421
01:36:20,150 --> 01:36:22,130
have you noticed
that the human race is divided

1422
01:36:22,230 --> 01:36:25,390
into two distinct
and irreconcilable groups?

1423
01:36:25,490 --> 01:36:29,310
Those who walk into rooms
and automatically turn television sets on,

1424
01:36:29,410 --> 01:36:32,150
and those who walk into rooms
and automatically turn them off.

1425
01:36:33,990 --> 01:36:36,270
You know, the problem is,
they usually marry each other,

1426
01:36:36,370 --> 01:36:37,940
which naturally causes a great deal...

1427
01:36:38,040 --> 01:36:40,720
<i>The elopement of Jocelyn Jordan,</i>
<i>daughter of Senator Thomas Jordan,</i>

1428
01:36:40,820 --> 01:36:44,200
<i>and Korean war hero Raymond Shaw,</i>
<i>stepson of Senator John Iselin.</i>

1429
01:36:44,300 --> 01:36:46,610
<i>- It appears, however...</i>
- My Romeo.

1430
01:36:46,710 --> 01:36:49,520
<i>that this Montague-Capulet note</i>
<i>will have little effect on the feud</i>

1431
01:36:49,620 --> 01:36:51,750
<i>now raging</i>
<i>between the two party leaders.</i>

1432
01:36:51,850 --> 01:36:53,910
<i>From his campaign headquarters</i>
<i>this morning,</i>

1433
01:36:54,010 --> 01:36:56,920
<i>Senator Iselin stepped up his charges</i>
<i>against the leader of the group</i>

1434
01:36:57,020 --> 01:36:59,040
<i>attempting to block his nomination.</i>

1435
01:36:59,140 --> 01:37:04,420
<i>I now charge this man, Thomas Jordan,</i>
<i>with high treason.</i>

1436
01:37:04,520 --> 01:37:08,470
<i>And I assure you,</i>
<i>the moment the Senate reconvenes,</i>

1437
01:37:08,570 --> 01:37:12,270
<i>I shall move for this man Jordan's</i>
<i>impeachment!</i>

1438
01:37:12,370 --> 01:37:15,350
<i>And after that, a civil trial.</i>

1439
01:37:15,450 --> 01:37:17,850
Come on. Get dressed.

1440
01:37:17,950 --> 01:37:20,940
We're driving down to New York.
Go straight to your father's house.

1441
01:37:21,040 --> 01:37:23,810
Please convey my personal apologies to him.
I'll join you there later.

1442
01:37:23,910 --> 01:37:25,700
What are you going to do?

1443
01:37:25,800 --> 01:37:27,780
<i>...that Thomas Jordan represents...</i>

1444
01:37:27,880 --> 01:37:30,160
Something I should've done
a long time ago.

1445
01:37:30,260 --> 01:37:35,170
I'm going to beat that vile, slandering
son of a numskull to a bloody pulp!

1446
01:37:38,760 --> 01:37:40,160
Mother!

1447
01:37:40,600 --> 01:37:44,310
That vile, slandering husband of yours!
Where is he?

1448
01:37:45,520 --> 01:37:49,350
Darling, something very important has come up.
There is something you have to do.

1449
01:38:07,250 --> 01:38:09,250
Who is it?

1450
01:38:12,460 --> 01:38:15,000
- It's me, sir.
- Raymond, my boy!

1451
01:38:17,210 --> 01:38:19,500
Jocie waited up as long as she could.

1452
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:21,670
She turned in about a quarter to 2:00.

1453
01:38:21,770 --> 01:38:23,340
She told me the good news.

1454
01:38:23,440 --> 01:38:24,880
- Raymond?
- Yes, sir.

1455
01:38:24,980 --> 01:38:28,550
I want to offer my congratulations
and welcome you to the family.

1456
01:38:28,650 --> 01:38:31,140
I've been watching
my daughter's face all evening.

1457
01:38:31,240 --> 01:38:33,260
She's a very happy girl.

1458
01:38:33,360 --> 01:38:35,350
- Thank you, sir.
- Come with me.

1459
01:38:35,450 --> 01:38:38,520
I'll force some good whiskey on you
to celebrate your wedding,

1460
01:38:38,620 --> 01:38:41,650
soothe you after a trying day,
any number of good reasons.

1461
01:38:41,750 --> 01:38:43,600
There's some whiskey
in that cabinet beside you.

1462
01:38:43,700 --> 01:38:45,400
Help yourself.

1463
01:38:45,500 --> 01:38:50,450
I only hope you haven't been too much upset
by these idiotic attacks of Iselin.

1464
01:38:50,550 --> 01:38:54,370
Actually, I take the position that
any attack by Iselin is a great honor.

1465
01:38:54,470 --> 01:38:57,160
Actually, I haven't had so much
supporting mail in the Senate

1466
01:38:57,260 --> 01:38:58,920
in the last 22 years.

1467
01:39:00,220 --> 01:39:02,380
I'm very glad to hear that, sir.

1468
01:39:04,510 --> 01:39:06,670
What the hell is that in your hand?

1469
01:39:06,770 --> 01:39:08,470
It's a pistol, sir.

1470
01:39:09,060 --> 01:39:10,640
Is that a silencer?

1471
01:39:11,350 --> 01:39:12,590
Yes, sir.

1472
01:39:12,690 --> 01:39:15,440
Why are you carrying a pistol?

1473
01:39:16,900 --> 01:39:18,900
Raymond, what are you...

1474
01:39:27,830 --> 01:39:30,570
Daddy, what is it?

1475
01:39:30,670 --> 01:39:32,830
Raymond, no! Raymond, darling.

1476
01:40:28,720 --> 01:40:29,720
Ben?

1477
01:40:40,400 --> 01:40:43,070
Ben, what is it?

1478
01:40:43,940 --> 01:40:46,950
Raymond Shaw shot and killed his wife
early this morning.

1479
01:40:53,410 --> 01:40:55,820
But i-it doesn't say...

1480
01:40:55,920 --> 01:40:57,320
I know.

1481
01:40:58,670 --> 01:41:00,790
It wasn't Raymond that really did it.

1482
01:41:02,920 --> 01:41:05,090
In a way, it was me.

1483
01:41:06,880 --> 01:41:08,750
As you can well understand,
gentlemen,

1484
01:41:08,850 --> 01:41:14,170
my... my wife is prostrate over the loss
of this dear and wonderful girl

1485
01:41:14,270 --> 01:41:16,260
whom she loved as a daughter.

1486
01:41:16,360 --> 01:41:19,180
And your stepson, Senator, where is he?

1487
01:41:19,280 --> 01:41:22,430
My... My son Raymond's in retreat,

1488
01:41:22,530 --> 01:41:25,850
praying for strength, understanding

1489
01:41:25,950 --> 01:41:29,610
to... to try and carry on somehow.

1490
01:41:34,370 --> 01:41:36,500
Ben, it's for you.

1491
01:41:43,290 --> 01:41:44,920
Major Marco speaking.

1492
01:41:46,590 --> 01:41:47,590
Ben?

1493
01:41:47,970 --> 01:41:49,570
Hi, kid.

1494
01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:52,670
How could anyone...

1495
01:41:52,770 --> 01:41:53,970
Jocie.

1496
01:41:55,060 --> 01:41:58,470
<i>- How could it happen?</i>
- Where are you, Raymond?

1497
01:41:58,570 --> 01:41:59,570
I...

1498
01:42:00,820 --> 01:42:03,730
I think maybe I'm going crazy.

1499
01:42:04,770 --> 01:42:08,390
I'm having terrible dreams
like you used to have and...

1500
01:42:08,490 --> 01:42:11,020
Where are you, Raymond?
We can't talk on the telephone.

1501
01:42:11,120 --> 01:42:12,780
Just tell me where you are.

1502
01:42:13,320 --> 01:42:15,280
Uh... I...

1503
01:42:15,380 --> 01:42:17,370
I'm in a hotel room

1504
01:42:19,120 --> 01:42:20,790
across from the Garden.

1505
01:42:22,330 --> 01:42:24,590
Eighth Avenue side.

1506
01:42:25,590 --> 01:42:26,990
Room 4.

1507
01:42:27,890 --> 01:42:30,210
All right. Now listen to me.
Just wait right there.

1508
01:42:30,310 --> 01:42:33,970
I'll be there in 10 minutes.
Don't move. Just wait right there.

1509
01:42:35,010 --> 01:42:36,760
Okay, I'll take him now.

1510
01:42:36,860 --> 01:42:38,970
Everything's got to move quite normally.

1511
01:42:39,070 --> 01:42:44,010
Now, I want him to feel like he's safe.
Just give me a pack of cards.

1512
01:42:44,110 --> 01:42:45,600
What do you know?

1513
01:42:45,700 --> 01:42:49,850
They just handed the vice presidential
nomination to that idiot Iselin.

1514
01:42:49,950 --> 01:42:50,950
Oh.

1515
01:43:07,210 --> 01:43:08,760
Hi, kid.

1516
01:43:11,630 --> 01:43:15,300
Who killed Jocie, Ben?

1517
01:43:16,890 --> 01:43:19,640
Tell me. I... I've got to know.

1518
01:43:35,990 --> 01:43:39,080
How about passing the time
by playing a little solitaire?

1519
01:43:49,170 --> 01:43:50,660
All right.

1520
01:43:50,760 --> 01:43:54,000
Now let's start unlocking
a few doors.

1521
01:43:54,100 --> 01:43:56,500
Let's begin with the patrol.

1522
01:43:56,600 --> 01:43:59,170
You didn't save our lives
and take out an enemy company

1523
01:43:59,270 --> 01:44:01,720
or anything like that,
did you, Raymond?

1524
01:44:01,820 --> 01:44:03,420
Did you?

1525
01:44:03,650 --> 01:44:05,310
- No.
- What happened?

1526
01:44:07,060 --> 01:44:10,230
The patrol was taken
by a Russian airborne unit

1527
01:44:11,280 --> 01:44:14,060
and flown by helicopter

1528
01:44:14,160 --> 01:44:17,620
across the Manchurian border
to a place called Tonghua.

1529
01:44:19,450 --> 01:44:22,490
We were worked on for three days

1530
01:44:22,590 --> 01:44:27,540
by a team of specialists
from the Pavlov Institute in Moscow.

1531
01:44:28,290 --> 01:44:32,130
They've developed a technique
for descent into the unconscious mind...

1532
01:44:32,960 --> 01:44:35,000
part light-induced and part drug.

1533
01:44:35,100 --> 01:44:37,460
Never mind all that. Not now.

1534
01:44:37,560 --> 01:44:39,550
Tell me what else happened at Tonghua.

1535
01:44:40,720 --> 01:44:42,970
We were drilled for three days.

1536
01:44:44,430 --> 01:44:47,840
We were made to memorize
the details of the imaginary action.

1537
01:44:47,970 --> 01:44:49,020
What else?

1538
01:44:55,110 --> 01:44:57,450
And I strangled Ed Mavole

1539
01:44:58,490 --> 01:45:01,120
and shot Bobby Lembeck.

1540
01:45:03,490 --> 01:45:06,070
One red queen works pretty good.

1541
01:45:06,170 --> 01:45:09,670
Let's see what we get with two of 'em.
Keep playing.

1542
01:45:24,600 --> 01:45:27,100
Then I killed Mr. Gaines.

1543
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:31,930
It was just a test.

1544
01:45:32,030 --> 01:45:34,770
It didn't matter who I killed.

1545
01:45:34,870 --> 01:45:37,480
They picked him to see
if all the linkages still worked

1546
01:45:37,580 --> 01:45:40,530
before they turned me over
to my American operator.

1547
01:45:43,700 --> 01:45:46,740
And that business
about jumping in the lake?

1548
01:45:46,840 --> 01:45:49,450
It really did happen.

1549
01:45:49,550 --> 01:45:52,120
It was an accident.

1550
01:45:52,220 --> 01:45:55,960
Something somebody said in the bar
accidentally triggered it.

1551
01:45:56,060 --> 01:45:57,220
Keep playing.

1552
01:46:08,390 --> 01:46:11,770
Then I killed Senator Jordan

1553
01:46:13,940 --> 01:46:16,230
and after that, I...

1554
01:46:17,740 --> 01:46:21,020
You are to forget everything that happened
at the senator's house.

1555
01:46:21,120 --> 01:46:22,940
Do you understand, Raymond?

1556
01:46:23,040 --> 01:46:25,070
You'll only remember it
when I tell you so.

1557
01:46:25,170 --> 01:46:27,580
You are to forget about it.
Do you understand?

1558
01:46:28,910 --> 01:46:30,360
Yes, sir.

1559
01:46:30,460 --> 01:46:33,060
Now, Raymond,

1560
01:46:33,380 --> 01:46:36,080
now the big one.

1561
01:46:36,180 --> 01:46:40,000
Why... Why is all of this being done?

1562
01:46:40,100 --> 01:46:42,050
What have they built you to do?

1563
01:46:43,930 --> 01:46:45,600
I don't know.

1564
01:46:49,390 --> 01:46:54,860
I don't think anybody really knows
except Berezovo in Moscow

1565
01:46:56,320 --> 01:46:58,690
and my American operator here.

1566
01:47:00,280 --> 01:47:03,900
Well, whatever it is,
it's supposed to happen soon.

1567
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,690
Right at the convention.

1568
01:47:06,790 --> 01:47:08,290
Maybe it...

1569
01:47:09,870 --> 01:47:11,830
I don't know.

1570
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:19,920
They can make me do anything,
Ben, can't they?

1571
01:47:21,920 --> 01:47:23,420
Anything.

1572
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:25,750
We'll see, kid.

1573
01:47:25,850 --> 01:47:28,600
We'll see what they can do
and we'll see what we can do.

1574
01:47:32,810 --> 01:47:35,310
So the red queen is our baby.

1575
01:47:37,020 --> 01:47:39,440
Well, take a look at this, kid.

1576
01:47:41,780 --> 01:47:43,280
Fifty-two of them.

1577
01:47:44,360 --> 01:47:46,320
Take a good look at 'em, Raymond.
Look at 'em.

1578
01:47:46,420 --> 01:47:49,320
And while you're looking, listen.

1579
01:47:49,420 --> 01:47:51,910
This is me, Marco, talking.

1580
01:47:53,040 --> 01:47:55,450
Fifty-two red queens and me
are telling you.

1581
01:47:55,550 --> 01:47:57,990
You know what we're telling you?
It's over.

1582
01:47:58,090 --> 01:48:01,460
The links, their beautifully
conditioned links are smashed.

1583
01:48:01,560 --> 01:48:04,460
They're smashed as of now
because we say so,

1584
01:48:04,560 --> 01:48:06,750
because we say
they are to be smashed.

1585
01:48:06,850 --> 01:48:09,800
We're bustin' up the joint.
We're tearing out all the wires.

1586
01:48:09,900 --> 01:48:11,800
We're busting it up so good,

1587
01:48:11,900 --> 01:48:13,700
all the queen's horses
and all the queen's men

1588
01:48:13,800 --> 01:48:15,640
will never put old Raymond
back together again.

1589
01:48:15,740 --> 01:48:18,140
You don't work anymore.

1590
01:48:18,240 --> 01:48:19,890
That's an order.

1591
01:48:19,990 --> 01:48:22,350
Anybody invites you
to a game of solitaire,

1592
01:48:22,450 --> 01:48:26,780
you tell 'em, "Sorry, buster.
The ball game is over."

1593
01:48:52,060 --> 01:48:55,310
It's time for my American operator
to give me the plan.

1594
01:48:59,650 --> 01:49:00,650
Yes?

1595
01:49:01,410 --> 01:49:03,570
Yes, I understand, Mother.

1596
01:49:12,540 --> 01:49:15,150
She wants me to go.

1597
01:49:15,250 --> 01:49:18,410
There's a car waiting for me downstairs.

1598
01:49:18,510 --> 01:49:22,090
The convention's adjourned. It reconvenes
at 9:00 for the acceptance speeches.

1599
01:49:23,630 --> 01:49:25,760
I don't think anything
will happen until then.

1600
01:49:27,680 --> 01:49:29,460
I'd better go now.

1601
01:49:29,560 --> 01:49:31,300
Here's a number.

1602
01:49:38,140 --> 01:49:42,680
I've got 500 people at my disposal,
a thousand if I need them.

1603
01:49:42,780 --> 01:49:46,440
You call me at that number.
Try to call me by 8:30.

1604
01:49:46,540 --> 01:49:49,190
Or as soon as you find out
whatever it is they want you to do.

1605
01:49:49,290 --> 01:49:50,730
I'll be waiting.

1606
01:49:50,830 --> 01:49:52,330
Yes, sir.

1607
01:49:54,990 --> 01:49:56,500
Raymond.

1608
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:02,340
Remember, Raymond,
the wires have been pulled.

1609
01:50:03,040 --> 01:50:05,330
They can't touch you anymore.

1610
01:50:05,430 --> 01:50:06,920
You're free.

1611
01:50:20,100 --> 01:50:23,720
It's been decided that you
will be dressed as a priest

1612
01:50:23,820 --> 01:50:26,730
to help you get away
in the pandemonium afterwards.

1613
01:50:27,530 --> 01:50:30,310
Chunjin will give you a two-piece
Soviet Army sniper's rifle

1614
01:50:30,410 --> 01:50:32,660
that fits nicely into a special bag.

1615
01:50:33,950 --> 01:50:36,580
There's a spotlight booth
that won't be in use.

1616
01:50:37,660 --> 01:50:40,870
It's up under the roof
on the Eighth Avenue side of the Garden.

1617
01:50:41,580 --> 01:50:45,000
You will have absolutely clear,
protected shooting.

1618
01:50:50,680 --> 01:50:54,010
You are to shoot the presidential nominee
through the head,

1619
01:50:54,890 --> 01:50:58,300
and Johnny will rise gallantly
to his feet

1620
01:50:58,400 --> 01:51:01,970
and lift Ben Arthur's body in his arms

1621
01:51:02,070 --> 01:51:05,650
and stand in front of the microphones
and begin to speak.

1622
01:51:07,730 --> 01:51:10,100
The speech is short,

1623
01:51:10,200 --> 01:51:12,860
but it's the most rousing speech
I've ever read.

1624
01:51:13,950 --> 01:51:17,700
It's been worked on here and in Russia
on and off for over eight years.

1625
01:51:18,870 --> 01:51:22,200
I shall force someone
to take the body away from him.

1626
01:51:22,300 --> 01:51:25,910
Then Johnny will really hit
those microphones and those cameras,

1627
01:51:26,010 --> 01:51:27,830
with blood all over him,

1628
01:51:27,930 --> 01:51:29,610
fighting off anyone
who tries to help him,

1629
01:51:29,720 --> 01:51:33,250
defending America
even if it means his own death,

1630
01:51:33,350 --> 01:51:36,630
rallying a nation of television viewers
into hysteria

1631
01:51:36,730 --> 01:51:39,010
to sweep us up into the White House

1632
01:51:39,110 --> 01:51:43,060
with powers that will make
martial law seem like anarchy.

1633
01:51:44,060 --> 01:51:46,020
Now, this is very important.

1634
01:51:47,900 --> 01:51:49,810
I want the nominee to be dead

1635
01:51:49,910 --> 01:51:53,940
about two minutes after he begins
his acceptance speech,

1636
01:51:54,040 --> 01:51:56,820
depending on his reading time
under pressure.

1637
01:51:56,920 --> 01:52:01,900
You are to hit him right at the point
that he finishes the phrase,

1638
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:07,240
"Nor would I ask of any fellow American
in defense of his freedom

1639
01:52:07,340 --> 01:52:11,830
that which I would not gladly give myself.

1640
01:52:11,930 --> 01:52:15,010
My life before my liberty."

1641
01:52:16,640 --> 01:52:19,430
Is that absolutely clear?

1642
01:52:24,140 --> 01:52:26,190
Would you repeat it for me, Raymond?

1643
01:52:27,190 --> 01:52:30,180
Nor would I ask
of any fellow American...

1644
01:52:30,280 --> 01:52:33,440
- In defense of his freedom...
- in defense of his freedom...

1645
01:52:33,540 --> 01:52:36,260
- that which I would not gladly...
- that which I would not gladly give...

1646
01:52:36,360 --> 01:52:38,190
- give myself.
- myself.

1647
01:52:38,290 --> 01:52:39,860
- My life...
- My life...

1648
01:52:39,960 --> 01:52:43,080
- before my liberty.
- before my liberty.

1649
01:52:55,930 --> 01:53:00,300
I know you will never entirely
comprehend this, Raymond,

1650
01:53:00,400 --> 01:53:04,890
but you must believe
I did not know it would be you.

1651
01:53:06,020 --> 01:53:09,100
I served them.
I fought for them.

1652
01:53:09,200 --> 01:53:11,600
I'm on the point of winning for them
the greatest foothold

1653
01:53:11,700 --> 01:53:14,140
they will ever have in this country.

1654
01:53:14,240 --> 01:53:16,230
And they paid me back

1655
01:53:16,330 --> 01:53:19,770
by taking your soul away from you.

1656
01:53:19,870 --> 01:53:22,480
I told them to build me an assassin.

1657
01:53:22,580 --> 01:53:25,570
I wanted a killer
from a world filled with killers,

1658
01:53:25,670 --> 01:53:27,820
and they chose you

1659
01:53:27,920 --> 01:53:31,130
because they thought
it would bind <i>me</i> closer to them.

1660
01:53:35,130 --> 01:53:38,710
But now we have come
almost to the end.

1661
01:53:38,810 --> 01:53:41,300
One last step,

1662
01:53:41,400 --> 01:53:43,460
and then when I take power,

1663
01:53:43,560 --> 01:53:47,090
they will be pulled down
and ground into dirt

1664
01:53:47,190 --> 01:53:50,100
for what they did to you

1665
01:53:50,200 --> 01:53:54,650
and what they did in so contemptuously
underestimating me.

1666
01:54:41,360 --> 01:54:44,070
One, two, three, four, five, six.

1667
01:54:59,420 --> 01:55:03,260
Testing.
One, two, three, four, five, six.

1668
01:55:47,180 --> 01:55:49,640
Hit the lights. Lights.

1669
01:56:07,490 --> 01:56:08,940
Lights out.

1670
01:56:09,040 --> 01:56:10,440
Lights!

1671
01:56:36,480 --> 01:56:39,010
Why hasn't he called?

1672
01:56:39,110 --> 01:56:42,110
It was a calculated risk, Ben.
You were right to take it.

1673
01:56:42,780 --> 01:56:45,740
Even if it's not true,
it's nice of you to say it.

1674
01:56:48,450 --> 01:56:49,940
The Garden's filling up.

1675
01:56:50,040 --> 01:56:52,110
Take it easy.

1676
01:56:52,210 --> 01:56:55,040
- 8:44.
- I know.

1677
01:57:00,750 --> 01:57:04,330
If Steinkamp doesn't take off that stupid hat
and stop messin' around with those broads,

1678
01:57:04,430 --> 01:57:06,630
I'm gonna bust him into a PFC.

1679
01:57:06,730 --> 01:57:08,470
Easy, Ben.

1680
01:57:12,180 --> 01:57:15,270
Okay, Milt, I blew it. I blew it!

1681
01:57:16,480 --> 01:57:19,180
My magic is better than your magic.

1682
01:57:19,280 --> 01:57:21,310
I should've known better.

1683
01:57:21,410 --> 01:57:24,490
Intelligence officer.
Stupidity officer is better.

1684
01:57:26,070 --> 01:57:28,290
If the Pentagon ever wants
to open up a stupidity division,

1685
01:57:28,390 --> 01:57:30,490
they know who they can get to lead it.

1686
01:57:34,200 --> 01:57:36,490
Well, Raymond was theirs.
He is theirs.

1687
01:57:36,590 --> 01:57:39,530
He'll always be theirs.

1688
01:57:39,630 --> 01:57:42,420
There's time. He may still call.

1689
01:57:47,590 --> 01:57:49,090
For money?

1690
01:57:51,850 --> 01:57:52,850
No.

1691
01:57:55,180 --> 01:57:57,180
That's what I figured.

1692
01:58:01,940 --> 01:58:04,610
- Let's get the hell out of here.
- All right, Ben. Let's go.

1693
01:59:38,200 --> 01:59:40,120
Milt, I tell you,
you've got to stop this thing.

1694
01:59:40,220 --> 01:59:42,370
Stop it? How can I stop it?
On what evidence?

1695
01:59:42,500 --> 01:59:45,960
If there was a bomb planted here, you got a
tip that there was, you'd stop it fast enough.

1696
01:59:46,060 --> 01:59:47,560
You'd empty the
White House if you had to.

1697
01:59:47,660 --> 01:59:50,620
I tell you, there's a bomb here,
a time bomb that's just waiting to go off.

1698
01:59:54,720 --> 01:59:57,710
Ladies and gentlemen,
our national anthem.

1699
01:59:57,810 --> 02:00:02,610
<i>~ Oh, say, can you see ~</i>

1700
02:00:02,820 --> 02:00:07,060
<i>~ By the dawn's early light ~</i>

1701
02:00:07,160 --> 02:00:11,560
<i>~ What so proudly we hailed ~</i>

1702
02:00:11,660 --> 02:00:16,650
<i>~ At the twilight's last gleaming? ~</i>

1703
02:00:16,750 --> 02:00:19,610
<i>- ~ Whose broad stripes and bright stars ~</i>
- Stop twitching.

1704
02:00:19,710 --> 02:00:21,600
Raymond has never missed
with a rifle in his life.

1705
02:00:21,700 --> 02:00:26,070
<i>~ Through the perilous fight ~</i>

1706
02:00:26,170 --> 02:00:30,950
<i>~ O'er the ramparts we watched ~</i>

1707
02:00:31,050 --> 02:00:36,130
<i>~ Were so gallantly streaming ~</i>

1708
02:00:36,230 --> 02:00:41,340
<i>~ And the rocket's red glare ~</i>

1709
02:00:41,440 --> 02:00:46,550
<i>~ The bombs bursting in air ~</i>

1710
02:00:46,650 --> 02:00:51,680
<i>~ Gave proof through the night ~</i>

1711
02:00:51,780 --> 02:00:57,860
<i>~ That our flag was still there ~</i>

1712
02:00:57,960 --> 02:01:05,530
<i>~ Oh, say does</i>
<i>that star-spangled banner ~</i>

1713
02:01:05,630 --> 02:01:08,030
<i>~ Yet wave ~</i>

1714
02:01:11,140 --> 02:01:16,740
<i>~ For the land of the free ~</i>

1715
02:01:17,140 --> 02:01:19,040
We're in like Flynn, lover.

1716
02:01:19,140 --> 02:01:22,340
<i>~ And the home ~</i>

1717
02:01:22,650 --> 02:01:26,050
<i>~ Of the brave ~~</i>

1718
02:01:39,950 --> 02:01:42,820
- Ladies and gentlemen...
- All you have to do is take it easy.

1719
02:01:42,920 --> 02:01:47,570
I give you the next president
of the United States,

1720
02:01:47,670 --> 02:01:51,470
Benjamin K. Arthur!

1721
02:02:18,700 --> 02:02:20,490
Mr. Chairman,

1722
02:02:21,870 --> 02:02:23,320
delegates,

1723
02:02:23,420 --> 02:02:26,860
my fellow Americans,

1724
02:02:26,960 --> 02:02:28,780
it is with great humility,

1725
02:02:28,880 --> 02:02:32,330
albeit with enormous pride

1726
02:02:32,430 --> 02:02:36,200
and with a sense
of the job to be done,

1727
02:02:36,300 --> 02:02:40,290
that I most humbly
and most gratefully

1728
02:02:40,390 --> 02:02:44,890
accept this nomination
for the highest office in our land.

1729
02:02:52,100 --> 02:02:54,230
It is with a full awareness

1730
02:02:55,190 --> 02:02:59,730
that the four years that lie ahead
for this country

1731
02:02:59,830 --> 02:03:02,900
are, in a sense, the crucial years.

1732
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:05,000
The years,

1733
02:03:05,420 --> 02:03:09,150
if I may borrow
Mr. Churchill's phrase,

1734
02:03:09,250 --> 02:03:11,200
"the years of decision."

1735
02:03:11,300 --> 02:03:16,040
And, if I may be permitted
a phrase of my own,

1736
02:03:16,140 --> 02:03:19,210
the years of striving.

1737
02:03:19,310 --> 02:03:25,050
For it is not what has
been done in the past,

1738
02:03:25,150 --> 02:03:28,720
or what may be done
against the far horizons

1739
02:03:28,820 --> 02:03:31,180
of some distant future,

1740
02:03:31,280 --> 02:03:35,690
but what will be done now.

1741
02:03:45,660 --> 02:03:48,690
...that you, my fellow Americans,

1742
02:03:48,790 --> 02:03:52,040
have placed on my shoulders.

1743
02:03:53,250 --> 02:03:57,240
Nor will I ask of any fellow American

1744
02:03:57,340 --> 02:03:59,800
in defense of his freedom...

1745
02:04:05,680 --> 02:04:07,680
Excuse me.

1746
02:04:07,900 --> 02:04:11,760
...that which I would not
gladly give myself.

1747
02:04:11,860 --> 02:04:15,810
My life before my liberty!

1748
02:04:43,130 --> 02:04:45,720
You couldn't have stopped them.
The army couldn't have stopped them.

1749
02:04:45,820 --> 02:04:48,760
So I had to.
That's why I didn't call.

1750
02:04:51,890 --> 02:04:53,980
Oh, God, Ben.

1751
02:05:04,530 --> 02:05:06,030
Poor Raymond.

1752
02:05:06,860 --> 02:05:09,160
Poor friendless, friendless Raymond.

1753
02:05:12,330 --> 02:05:14,700
He was wearing his medal
when he died.

1754
02:05:19,210 --> 02:05:21,880
You should read some
of the citations some time.

1755
02:05:23,300 --> 02:05:25,220
Just read them.

1756
02:05:28,140 --> 02:05:31,130
"Taken eight prisoners,
killing four enemy in the process,

1757
02:05:31,230 --> 02:05:33,470
while one leg and one arm
were shattered

1758
02:05:33,570 --> 02:05:36,590
and he could only crawl
because the other leg had been blown off.

1759
02:05:36,690 --> 02:05:38,290
Edwards.

1760
02:05:38,570 --> 02:05:40,140
Wounded five times,

1761
02:05:40,240 --> 02:05:43,730
dragged himself across the direct fire
of three enemy machine guns

1762
02:05:43,830 --> 02:05:45,810
to pull two of his wounded men to safety

1763
02:05:45,910 --> 02:05:50,440
amid 69 dead and 203 casualties.

1764
02:05:50,540 --> 02:05:52,030
Holderman."

1765
02:06:03,710 --> 02:06:06,040
Made to commit acts

1766
02:06:06,140 --> 02:06:08,970
too unspeakable to be cited here

1767
02:06:12,100 --> 02:06:16,430
by an enemy who had captured
his mind and his soul.

1768
02:06:21,060 --> 02:06:23,060
He freed himself at last

1769
02:06:25,780 --> 02:06:27,730
and, in the end,

1770
02:06:27,830 --> 02:06:33,580
heroically and unhesitatingly
gave his life to save his country.

1771
02:06:34,910 --> 02:06:36,410
Raymond Shaw.

1772
02:06:40,420 --> 02:06:42,220
Oh, hell!

1773
02:06:42,630 --> 02:06:43,630
Hell!
