1
00:03:58,814 --> 00:04:03,012
"Where life had no value,
death, sometimes, had its price.

2
00:04:03,084 --> 00:04:07,545
That is why
the bounty killers appeared."

3
00:04:20,569 --> 00:04:22,332
Tickets.

4
00:04:23,272 --> 00:04:25,796
Tickets, please.

5
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:34,577
Thank you. Tickets.

6
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:37,084
Is it far to Tucumcari?

7
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:39,245
We should pass there
in about three or four minutes.

8
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,651
Thanks.

9
00:04:40,723 --> 00:04:44,055
Excuse me, but you've
made a mistake, Reverend.

10
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:46,616
I couldn't help hearing
you're going to Tucumcari.

11
00:04:46,695 --> 00:04:49,858
I peddle goods around here, and I better
tell you you're on the wrong train.

12
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:56,967
I think the nearest stop
to Tucumcari is Amarillo.

13
00:04:57,038 --> 00:05:00,303
By getting off at Sante Fe
and returning by way of Amarillo...

14
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:04,142
you should be able to get
right where you're going.

15
00:05:06,548 --> 00:05:10,712
You see, the train
doesn't stop at Tucumcari.

16
00:05:20,962 --> 00:05:23,397
This train'll stop at Tucumcari.

17
00:05:49,091 --> 00:05:51,923
Take it easy, everybody!

18
00:05:51,993 --> 00:05:54,257
Why'd you stop?
Something gone wrong?

19
00:05:54,329 --> 00:05:56,524
Somebody pulled the emergency cord.

20
00:06:06,909 --> 00:06:10,538
Hey, mister, you just can't pull
the emergency cord and jump off.

21
00:06:10,613 --> 00:06:13,673
Why'd you stop that train?
If you want to get off, you...

22
00:06:14,683 --> 00:06:18,209
Well, the railroad company'd be mighty
pleased to make any arrangements...

23
00:06:18,286 --> 00:06:21,414
for any passenger if you want
to get off here, sir.

24
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:24,185
I did get off. Thanks.

25
00:06:26,762 --> 00:06:29,993
All right, let's go!
Go ahead!

26
00:07:03,699 --> 00:07:07,464
Guy passed by here in person
and added on those two zeros.

27
00:07:07,536 --> 00:07:11,164
He was spittin' mad when he saw what
they was offerin'. He wasn't flattered.

28
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:14,402
He said, "A measly thousand bucks
for me is much too little.

29
00:07:14,476 --> 00:07:17,308
I'm worth a lot more than that."

30
00:07:17,378 --> 00:07:20,370
He said that, and then he added
the zeros on the thousand.

31
00:07:22,216 --> 00:07:25,777
There isn't anyone got the guts
to face that killer, eh?

32
00:07:33,361 --> 00:07:35,262
At least...

33
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:38,094
it's been that way till now.

34
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,702
Where is he?

35
00:08:35,224 --> 00:08:37,158
Where is he?

36
00:08:45,501 --> 00:08:47,435
I have no idea
where he'd be today.

37
00:09:10,191 --> 00:09:12,126
- Hold still.
- But Guy...

38
00:09:12,194 --> 00:09:15,094
- Hold still, I said.
- You hurt me with those hands of yours.

39
00:09:15,164 --> 00:09:17,927
- Then do as I tell ya.
- Stop it!

40
00:09:17,999 --> 00:09:20,867
>Now see, you've made me drop the soap.

41
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:24,868
- Wait, I'll get it for ya.
- You're killing me.

42
00:09:27,876 --> 00:09:29,844
Oh, look. What's that?

43
00:10:12,186 --> 00:10:14,747
Pardon me, ma'am.

44
00:11:45,479 --> 00:11:47,276
I'll kill you for this.

45
00:11:59,026 --> 00:12:01,655
There you are.
A thousand dollars.

46
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:14,334
What do you know about Cavanagh?

47
00:12:14,408 --> 00:12:17,469
About a week ago
he was seen at White Rocks.

48
00:12:17,546 --> 00:12:19,706
Thanks.

49
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:22,045
If it's of any interest to ya...

50
00:12:22,117 --> 00:12:24,710
somebody else dropped in
to see me about him.

51
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,983
Who?

52
00:12:27,055 --> 00:12:29,819
I'd never seen him before.

53
00:12:29,891 --> 00:12:32,518
His name is Monco.

54
00:14:02,744 --> 00:14:04,679
Light?

55
00:14:06,849 --> 00:14:09,282
You know Baby Cavanagh?

56
00:14:12,421 --> 00:14:15,083
>Now tell me,
you know where I can find him?

57
00:14:22,098 --> 00:14:25,123
There, at that table.

58
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,134
He's got his back to ya.

59
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:32,773
Thanks.

60
00:15:38,107 --> 00:15:40,041
Two cards.

61
00:16:19,915 --> 00:16:22,041
Didn't hear what the bet was.

62
00:16:25,253 --> 00:16:26,743
Your life.

63
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:58,819
Alive or dead...
it's your choice.

64
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:04,257
Let Red go.

65
00:17:41,263 --> 00:17:44,130
Two thousand dollars.
It's a lot of money.

66
00:17:44,199 --> 00:17:46,462
Takes me three years to earn it.

67
00:17:46,535 --> 00:17:50,767
Tell me, isn't a sheriff
supposed to be courageous, loyal...

68
00:17:50,838 --> 00:17:52,773
and above all, honest?

69
00:17:53,776 --> 00:17:56,006
Yeah, that he is.

70
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:10,853
I think you people
need a new sheriff.

71
00:21:11,707 --> 00:21:13,766
Hughie.

72
00:21:49,878 --> 00:21:51,812
How are you, >Nino?

73
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,814
Better when I see you.

74
00:22:06,995 --> 00:22:08,929
Go on. Go ahead.

75
00:22:30,986 --> 00:22:32,384
Open it.

76
00:22:51,305 --> 00:22:54,536
- What's up? Who is it?
- Rodriguez, senor.

77
00:23:26,607 --> 00:23:29,236
You. Come along.

78
00:23:44,492 --> 00:23:46,427
I'm letting you live, hero.

79
00:23:46,495 --> 00:23:49,691
That's so you can tell everybody
you've seen what takes place here.

80
00:24:49,053 --> 00:24:50,988
For the lousy money.

81
00:24:59,229 --> 00:25:01,663
You took money
to put me behind bars.

82
00:25:04,702 --> 00:25:06,636
You should've killed me
when you could.

83
00:25:07,471 --> 00:25:09,405
It would be better for you.

84
00:25:10,741 --> 00:25:12,732
And for them.

85
00:25:16,013 --> 00:25:18,174
How old's the boy?

86
00:25:21,786 --> 00:25:24,015
How old is the boy, I asked?

87
00:25:24,955 --> 00:25:26,651
He's 18 months now.

88
00:25:28,125 --> 00:25:30,959
Just the time that I was in jail.

89
00:25:33,664 --> 00:25:35,928
You used the reward that you got...

90
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,434
to start raising a family.

91
00:25:40,104 --> 00:25:42,334
And that's why I feel
your family is partly mine.

92
00:25:45,042 --> 00:25:47,442
I'll take my part now.

93
00:25:47,511 --> 00:25:49,445
Outside.

94
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:56,909
They're both innocent. Please let them
go! I was the one. You know that.

95
00:26:25,249 --> 00:26:28,741
I know.
I'm sure you hate me just enough.

96
00:26:52,042 --> 00:26:54,603
This time you'll have a chance
to shoot me, but not in the back.

97
00:26:58,382 --> 00:26:59,576
Let go.

98
00:27:06,056 --> 00:27:08,286
When you hear the music finish, begin.

99
00:27:09,993 --> 00:27:11,927
Or do you think you can?

100
00:27:15,432 --> 00:27:17,491
Let's start.

101
00:29:13,617 --> 00:29:15,585
>Now.

102
00:29:54,358 --> 00:29:57,191
- Check those figures again.
- Yes, sir.

103
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:02,494
Good day, sir. Good afternoon.

104
00:30:02,566 --> 00:30:05,228
Mortimer.

105
00:30:05,302 --> 00:30:08,363
- Douglas Mortimer.
- Mortimer. Virginia, isn't it?

106
00:30:08,438 --> 00:30:11,134
- Carolina.
- That's right, Carolina.

107
00:30:11,209 --> 00:30:13,472
Can I help in some way?

108
00:30:13,543 --> 00:30:17,502
- I'm looking for a first-class bank.
- Oh, but exactly.

109
00:30:17,581 --> 00:30:19,048
Yeah.

110
00:30:19,116 --> 00:30:22,517
The largest and most secure bank
in the territory.

111
00:30:22,586 --> 00:30:25,384
Well, Mr. Mortimer,
I want to assure you our bank here...

112
00:30:25,455 --> 00:30:28,117
has everything...
all the safeguards you're looking for.

113
00:30:28,191 --> 00:30:31,456
I don't doubt that, but I have
a large sum to deposit.

114
00:30:31,528 --> 00:30:33,655
>Now, suppose I'm a bandit.

115
00:30:36,466 --> 00:30:38,434
A bandit?

116
00:30:38,502 --> 00:30:41,494
A very dangerous bandit
with a gang of killers.

117
00:30:41,571 --> 00:30:46,270
What would be the most
impossible bank for me to rob?

118
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:50,007
In your case, the one bank
I would suggest is the Bank of El Paso.

119
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,207
>Not even Indio would dare
to attack that one.

120
00:30:52,282 --> 00:30:54,876
It's not a bank.
It's a fortress there.

121
00:30:59,923 --> 00:31:02,323
What time's the next train
for El Paso?

122
00:31:02,392 --> 00:31:04,826
11:30. I'll telegraph
to my colleague...

123
00:31:04,895 --> 00:31:07,193
in the Bank of El Paso
that you're going to arrive.

124
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:09,323
Thanks.

125
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:37,087
Hey, mister. Captain.
General. Welcome.

126
00:31:37,161 --> 00:31:40,493
Do you need a stable or a room?
Do you want to take a bath?

127
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:43,328
My name is Fernando.
The stable is right here.

128
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:45,197
And that is your hotel.

129
00:31:46,269 --> 00:31:48,863
Why this hotel
and not some other?

130
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:51,601
You probably wouldn't like
that other place as much, senor.

131
00:31:51,675 --> 00:31:54,906
You'd have to spend half the night
shootin' cockroaches.

132
00:31:54,978 --> 00:31:57,378
At this hotel, the rooms
will cost you so much less.

133
00:31:57,447 --> 00:31:59,438
And there's a landlady
at this one, senor.

134
00:32:01,051 --> 00:32:03,383
- Married?
- Yes, but she doesn't care.

135
00:32:22,373 --> 00:32:25,671
That's the bank. As soon as I get
some money, I'll put it in.

136
00:32:25,742 --> 00:32:28,040
Well, you're gonna have
to earn it first.

137
00:32:29,946 --> 00:32:32,414
I have 50 cents here for you
if you'll let me know...

138
00:32:32,482 --> 00:32:36,976
when anybody you've never seen before
here in El Paso comes to town.

139
00:32:37,053 --> 00:32:40,250
At the hotel, senor.
A stranger just came outta there.

140
00:32:47,431 --> 00:32:49,365
Where's he staying?

141
00:32:58,408 --> 00:33:00,342
The hotel.

142
00:33:04,047 --> 00:33:06,709
Let me know if you see
any more strangers.

143
00:33:06,783 --> 00:33:09,013
Sure, senor.

144
00:33:24,267 --> 00:33:27,532
- Help you, sir?
- I want the room right above.

145
00:33:27,604 --> 00:33:30,937
I'm sorry, it's occupied.
It's too bad.

146
00:33:31,007 --> 00:33:33,874
The hotel's filled to capacity.
I'm sorry.

147
00:33:33,944 --> 00:33:36,970
The room you want is our best.
It's always occupied.

148
00:33:37,047 --> 00:33:38,241
By who?

149
00:33:39,282 --> 00:33:41,011
Check the register.

150
00:33:41,084 --> 00:33:42,676
Mary!

151
00:33:44,354 --> 00:33:46,584
It's Senor Martinez.

152
00:33:55,198 --> 00:33:58,430
- It's free now.
- That room is taken!

153
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:01,703
I'll see to it.

154
00:34:06,911 --> 00:34:10,142
He's nothing but a wild,
vicious animal!

155
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:12,147
He's tall, isn't he?

156
00:34:16,254 --> 00:34:18,187
You're just dirty!

157
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:33,230
Proprietor, quick! My bill!

158
00:34:33,303 --> 00:34:35,238
I want my bill!

159
00:34:37,475 --> 00:34:40,535
- Before he comes down, give me my bill.
- There's no need to check out.

160
00:34:40,611 --> 00:34:43,807
Everything's gonna be all right.
I'll give you another room immediately.

161
00:34:43,881 --> 00:34:47,145
It's the best in the whole hotel.
We'll let him have the bridal suite.

162
00:34:47,218 --> 00:34:49,584
>No, Mary, the bill.
I'd like to stay, only I can't.

163
00:34:49,653 --> 00:34:52,383
- Don't go, Mr. Martinez.
- I have an appointment elsewhere.

164
00:34:56,693 --> 00:34:58,821
Yes, senor, what do you want?

165
00:35:04,768 --> 00:35:06,702
I don't wear 'em.

166
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:08,931
I'm honored that you thought of me.
Thank you.

167
00:35:48,678 --> 00:35:51,306
Watch this.

168
00:36:15,138 --> 00:36:17,073
Hello, my friends.

169
00:36:18,341 --> 00:36:20,138
Hello, Indio.

170
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:23,180
You see, I didn't waste
a minute coming here.

171
00:36:23,247 --> 00:36:26,147
Indio calls and Groggy
comes running right away.

172
00:36:26,216 --> 00:36:27,707
And Sancho?

173
00:36:27,785 --> 00:36:31,618
If you're waiting for Sancho, I'll go
and come back in about four years.

174
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:35,055
He's in prison for four years.

175
00:36:41,698 --> 00:36:45,259
Bad for him.
>Not so bad for the rest of us.

176
00:36:45,335 --> 00:36:48,305
A man who gets caught
doesn't deserve respect, huh?

177
00:36:50,774 --> 00:36:52,969
What's it all about, huh?

178
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:54,602
>Now just listen.

179
00:36:58,982 --> 00:37:00,575
A bank at El Paso.

180
00:37:02,452 --> 00:37:03,852
Let's see.

181
00:37:03,921 --> 00:37:08,948
We'll say this is the inside
of the bank. >Nino is the safe.

182
00:37:09,026 --> 00:37:12,017
Which weighs three tons
and can't be opened with dynamite.

183
00:37:13,663 --> 00:37:15,597
There's the part with two cashiers.

184
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:19,528
This is the manager's desk.

185
00:37:19,602 --> 00:37:22,401
Right in back is a fancy cabinet
containing bottles...

186
00:37:22,472 --> 00:37:25,066
for offering drinks
to the rich depositors.

187
00:37:26,977 --> 00:37:31,073
There's the main door, and opposite
they built a double wall.

188
00:37:31,147 --> 00:37:33,115
What happens, Groggy?

189
00:37:33,183 --> 00:37:37,176
Let's say you've already killed
the two cashiers and the manager.

190
00:37:37,254 --> 00:37:41,189
For the next few minutes,
you're the boss of the bank.

191
00:37:41,257 --> 00:37:43,191
>Now what?

192
00:37:44,227 --> 00:37:46,526
The time's been wasted.

193
00:37:48,098 --> 00:37:51,830
Right, a waste of time.
Especially, Groggy, to blast open...

194
00:37:51,901 --> 00:37:55,632
that damn iron safe, we'd have
to be using so much dynamite...

195
00:37:55,705 --> 00:37:58,640
that the whole bank
would just disappear.

196
00:37:58,709 --> 00:38:01,700
And you'd all go up with it.

197
00:38:01,778 --> 00:38:06,511
Besides, the presence of a safe alone
doesn't always signify...

198
00:38:06,584 --> 00:38:08,414
that there is money inside.

199
00:38:10,086 --> 00:38:12,020
To help you understand what I mean...

200
00:38:14,357 --> 00:38:18,794
I would like to relate
a nice little parable.

201
00:38:21,431 --> 00:38:24,196
Once upon a time
there was a carpenter.

202
00:38:26,469 --> 00:38:28,664
You don't think a carpenter
can make money, eh?

203
00:38:29,739 --> 00:38:32,173
>No? You're wrong.

204
00:38:33,276 --> 00:38:38,044
This one did well because
he was a builder of safes.

205
00:38:39,249 --> 00:38:41,444
There was a banker once...

206
00:38:41,518 --> 00:38:44,147
who decided he must have
his iron safe disguised...

207
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:47,747
to look like a wood cabinet.

208
00:38:50,928 --> 00:38:52,861
To get it made...

209
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:57,526
the banker goes to our carpenter
for the job, and one day...

210
00:38:58,635 --> 00:39:00,763
as destiny has it...

211
00:39:00,837 --> 00:39:03,397
the carpenter's in El Paso.

212
00:39:03,473 --> 00:39:06,671
He happens to walk into the bank there,
and what does he find?

213
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:08,872
The cabinet.

214
00:39:09,979 --> 00:39:13,006
Since he'd worked on the cabinet,
he spotted it right away.

215
00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:16,683
From that day on,
he couldn't work anymore.

216
00:39:16,754 --> 00:39:19,779
Pity, because...

217
00:39:19,856 --> 00:39:22,689
there was something he had to do.

218
00:39:22,759 --> 00:39:25,557
There was this crazy idea.

219
00:39:25,629 --> 00:39:27,562
And it stayed...

220
00:39:31,669 --> 00:39:34,432
to put his hands on the money inside.

221
00:39:34,504 --> 00:39:36,439
Get in there and grab all the money.

222
00:39:38,174 --> 00:39:42,076
Sure, you think that carpenter
was lucky the way things work out...

223
00:39:42,145 --> 00:39:44,546
that he was lucky
to go in just that bank.

224
00:39:44,614 --> 00:39:46,548
It wasn't true.

225
00:39:48,585 --> 00:39:50,781
His good fortune stopped that day.

226
00:39:50,854 --> 00:39:53,220
Because later...

227
00:39:53,289 --> 00:39:55,223
as a prisoner...

228
00:39:57,961 --> 00:39:59,895
he ran into me.

229
00:40:04,868 --> 00:40:08,326
The carpenter told me the story,
and I tell you.

230
00:40:14,777 --> 00:40:17,075
The money isn't in the safe.
It's right in this!

231
00:40:20,683 --> 00:40:23,243
Almost a million dollars in it.

232
00:40:26,055 --> 00:40:28,615
Your colleague in Tucumcari told me
that this bank...

233
00:40:28,691 --> 00:40:31,854
has the largest deposits
in the whole state.

234
00:40:31,928 --> 00:40:34,055
Yes, that's correct,
Mr. Mortimer.

235
00:40:34,131 --> 00:40:38,328
Here at the bank at El Paso we have half
a million dollars in reserve on hand.

236
00:40:41,337 --> 00:40:45,205
I see. You sure this bank
is secure enough to hold that much?

237
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:48,109
From the moment your money's
on deposit here...

238
00:40:48,178 --> 00:40:50,111
you can sleep without any worries.

239
00:40:53,249 --> 00:40:55,615
Besides...

240
00:40:55,685 --> 00:40:58,415
when the bank is closed,
an armed guard always remains here...

241
00:40:58,488 --> 00:41:01,116
and a patrol
is on guard outside.

242
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:05,183
Even the Bank of San Francisco
isn't that well protected.

243
00:41:05,261 --> 00:41:08,924
Exactly. The truth is...

244
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,258
to try robbing us
would be so futile...

245
00:41:12,335 --> 00:41:15,736
that only a complete fool
would attempt it.

246
00:41:15,805 --> 00:41:17,899
Yeah.

247
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:20,033
Or a complete madman.

248
00:41:30,754 --> 00:41:32,914
Get out of the way!
Get out of here!

249
00:42:18,868 --> 00:42:20,803
More news, amigo.

250
00:42:23,073 --> 00:42:25,803
Another stranger in town?

251
00:42:25,875 --> 00:42:28,504
Yes. And I know something else.

252
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:37,812
There was another stranger
I didn't tell you about.

253
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:40,856
Listen to me,
you sawed-off little runt!

254
00:42:40,923 --> 00:42:43,414
I want to know how many men
there are all together.

255
00:42:43,493 --> 00:42:45,859
Well, there were two.
>Now there's two more.

256
00:42:45,928 --> 00:42:48,328
Where?

257
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:50,765
In the saloon.

258
00:45:00,631 --> 00:45:01,961
Whiskey.

259
00:45:02,031 --> 00:45:05,228
Listen, mister, why do you choose
my place to commit suicide?

260
00:45:05,301 --> 00:45:08,702
I know that man.
It's a miracle you're alive.

261
00:45:08,772 --> 00:45:12,401
Why should a man walk around with
a pistol and let himself be insulted?

262
00:45:12,475 --> 00:45:14,410
It's mighty strange.

263
00:45:14,477 --> 00:45:16,446
If the hunchback didn't shoot you...

264
00:45:16,513 --> 00:45:20,004
he had a very important reason,
that's all.

265
00:45:21,685 --> 00:45:23,652
I was thinking that myself.

266
00:46:23,714 --> 00:46:26,307
1, 2...

267
00:46:26,382 --> 00:46:30,614
3, now 4, now 5...

268
00:46:38,828 --> 00:46:42,196
11, 12, 13...

269
00:46:42,265 --> 00:46:45,723
14, 15, 16...

270
00:46:45,801 --> 00:46:50,205
17, 18, 19...

271
00:46:50,274 --> 00:46:54,471
20, 21, 22...

272
00:46:54,544 --> 00:46:57,603
23, 24...

273
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:00,478
25, 26...

274
00:47:00,549 --> 00:47:05,613
27, 28, 29...

275
00:47:05,689 --> 00:47:08,555
30, 31...

276
00:47:08,624 --> 00:47:11,957
32 and 33.

277
00:48:57,033 --> 00:48:58,966
All right, now.

278
00:49:00,504 --> 00:49:03,200
I don't know him!

279
00:49:03,272 --> 00:49:05,207
Come on, now, you know everybody.

280
00:49:05,274 --> 00:49:09,075
I don't know anybody anymore!
I'm dead! Understand?

281
00:49:09,145 --> 00:49:11,613
Well, there was a time
when I knew everybody.

282
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:14,513
That was a long time ago
when all this was prairie.

283
00:49:14,584 --> 00:49:16,984
In these days everybody's in a hurry.
That's right...

284
00:49:17,053 --> 00:49:19,647
with your damned
good-for-nothing trains!

285
00:49:23,026 --> 00:49:24,515
Disgusting!

286
00:49:24,593 --> 00:49:26,926
One day, someone from the railroad
comes here to see me.

287
00:49:26,997 --> 00:49:30,660
He says, "Prophet, the railway's
gonna go right past your house."

288
00:49:30,734 --> 00:49:33,669
"Is that so?" I said.

289
00:49:33,736 --> 00:49:36,102
"Yep, that right," he says.

290
00:49:36,172 --> 00:49:38,402
"All those trains
gonna go right past here.

291
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:40,806
The best thing for you, Prophet,
is sell your land to the company...

292
00:49:40,877 --> 00:49:42,605
or else we'll buy Baker's.

293
00:49:42,678 --> 00:49:45,442
He lives next to your place,
and I'll put the tracks here...

294
00:49:45,515 --> 00:49:47,607
and that'll make you go crazy.

295
00:49:47,683 --> 00:49:49,879
Will you sell out
to our company, Prophet?"

296
00:49:49,952 --> 00:49:52,421
"Oh, is that so?" says I.

297
00:49:54,256 --> 00:49:56,690
He was very anxious
for me to sell out.

298
00:49:56,759 --> 00:49:59,024
You know what I told him
about the railroad?

299
00:49:59,094 --> 00:50:01,961
You know what I told him
he could do with his railroad?

300
00:50:21,017 --> 00:50:23,712
You know what my decision
about selling was?

301
00:50:23,786 --> 00:50:25,720
Well, you said no.

302
00:50:25,788 --> 00:50:29,189
You're right about that.
>No to him and his damn trains!

303
00:50:29,258 --> 00:50:31,192
I wouldn't! >No!

304
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:34,196
Look, listen to me, old man.

305
00:50:34,263 --> 00:50:36,198
You're supposed to be a prophet.

306
00:50:36,265 --> 00:50:39,098
I didn't come here to listen to you
rattle on about trains.

307
00:50:39,169 --> 00:50:42,569
I want to find out about this man.
It's obvious you don't know anything.

308
00:50:42,638 --> 00:50:45,402
>No need to be insulting.
If that's all you came here to do...

309
00:50:45,475 --> 00:50:48,443
you can clear out of my house fast
before I lose my temper.

310
00:50:48,511 --> 00:50:50,446
Understand?

311
00:50:54,216 --> 00:50:56,411
Hey! Where you goin'?

312
00:50:59,421 --> 00:51:02,219
I guess I better leave before
you go and lose your temper.

313
00:51:03,292 --> 00:51:05,624
What's the matter with you?
Why are you so dang stupid?

314
00:51:05,694 --> 00:51:07,629
Hurry up,
give me that pistol there.

315
00:51:07,696 --> 00:51:10,131
Yeah, right there behind ya.

316
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:12,133
Hurry!

317
00:51:12,201 --> 00:51:15,602
Yes, that's the one.
>Now, hand it over.

318
00:51:15,671 --> 00:51:19,334
That's it. Give me that gun.
The man you asked about.

319
00:51:19,408 --> 00:51:22,401
There's only one question:
How does he carry his gun?

320
00:51:22,478 --> 00:51:24,673
He wears it here,
across his belly?

321
00:51:24,747 --> 00:51:28,205
Well, why didn't you tell me that
in the first place, my boy.

322
00:51:28,285 --> 00:51:30,752
Of course I know the man
you're trying to find out about.

323
00:51:30,819 --> 00:51:32,754
Of course I know him.

324
00:51:32,821 --> 00:51:35,654
He's Colonel Douglas Mortimer.

325
00:51:35,725 --> 00:51:38,625
Mortimer... a brave man, a soldier.

326
00:51:39,461 --> 00:51:41,952
He was known as the best shot
in the Carolinas.

327
00:51:42,031 --> 00:51:43,658
A great soldier.

328
00:51:43,732 --> 00:51:47,634
>Now he's reduced to being
a bounty killer, same as you.

329
00:51:47,703 --> 00:51:49,466
Because of trains!

330
00:51:49,538 --> 00:51:52,837
Because of the damn trains!
Damn 'em!

331
00:53:19,261 --> 00:53:23,198
Take it to the station.
The gentleman's leavin'.

332
00:53:27,836 --> 00:53:29,600
Hold it.

333
00:53:31,573 --> 00:53:33,040
Take it back.

334
00:53:36,312 --> 00:53:38,404
Take it to the station.

335
00:53:40,482 --> 00:53:43,383
- Go inside.
- The station!

336
00:54:52,388 --> 00:54:54,582
Just like the games we know.

337
00:55:50,212 --> 00:55:52,477
- He's picking it up.
- A trick, maybe.

338
00:57:38,252 --> 00:57:42,654
How can somebody in my business
go around with a contraption like this?

339
00:57:43,757 --> 00:57:45,691
That contraption...

340
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:49,156
almost sent you to your grave.

341
00:57:51,164 --> 00:57:54,361
You're forgetting one thing, Colonel...
I was shooting at your hat.

342
00:57:54,435 --> 00:57:56,664
Well, I was only shooting at yours.

343
00:57:57,738 --> 00:58:00,002
But I recall firing first.

344
00:58:02,008 --> 00:58:03,839
Boy...

345
00:58:03,910 --> 00:58:07,107
I've reached almost 50 years
of age with my system.

346
00:58:07,180 --> 00:58:09,513
>Not many men last long
in these parts.

347
00:58:09,584 --> 00:58:11,847
How long do you expect to last?

348
00:58:13,587 --> 00:58:15,180
Much longer than that.

349
00:58:16,256 --> 00:58:20,091
When I get my hands on Indio
and that $ 10,000...

350
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:23,527
I'm gonna buy myself a little place,
possibly retire.

351
00:58:25,132 --> 00:58:28,067
Well, I don't believe we ought
to start another fight.

352
00:58:28,135 --> 00:58:30,194
But you forget one small detail.

353
00:58:30,270 --> 00:58:31,794
What's that?

354
00:58:31,872 --> 00:58:34,136
I wanna get my hands on Indio too.

355
00:58:34,207 --> 00:58:36,642
Sure, after me.

356
00:58:38,312 --> 00:58:40,575
Or before you.

357
00:58:40,647 --> 00:58:42,582
Or at the same time.

358
00:58:45,719 --> 00:58:47,381
Is that a proposition?

359
00:58:48,789 --> 00:58:50,347
An equal partnership.

360
00:58:51,426 --> 00:58:53,290
Why? Why should I?

361
00:58:53,361 --> 00:58:55,294
I can think of three reasons.

362
00:58:55,363 --> 00:58:57,524
First is there's 14 of them.

363
00:58:57,597 --> 00:58:59,497
Yeah, that's a lot.

364
00:58:59,566 --> 00:59:01,124
A lot for me.

365
00:59:01,201 --> 00:59:03,727
Yeah. >No small number
even for two of us.

366
00:59:03,805 --> 00:59:05,397
Second reason?

367
00:59:06,673 --> 00:59:08,732
Second reason...

368
00:59:11,278 --> 00:59:13,906
The second reason is
you could make it 15 to one.

369
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:16,448
Don't forget I wanna play
in this game too.

370
00:59:16,517 --> 00:59:20,919
As you're aware, when two hunters
go after the same prey...

371
00:59:20,988 --> 00:59:24,423
they usually end up shooting each other
in the back, and we don't want that.

372
00:59:28,796 --> 00:59:30,957
Then the colonel dies, hmm?

373
00:59:33,301 --> 00:59:35,200
All right, I'll be generous.

374
00:59:36,903 --> 00:59:39,531
You can have the reward
for Indio...

375
00:59:39,606 --> 00:59:41,801
and I'll take the reward
for the rest of the band.

376
00:59:45,145 --> 00:59:47,205
All wrong.

377
00:59:47,281 --> 00:59:51,774
Indio's worth $ 10,000 dollars, but
the rest adds up to much more than that.

378
00:59:51,852 --> 00:59:55,413
Blackie's worth four,
Wild's worth three, >Nino two.

379
00:59:55,489 --> 00:59:57,151
>Nino's one.

380
00:59:59,826 --> 01:00:02,227
Well, Frisco's worth two.

381
01:00:02,296 --> 01:00:04,786
That's ten thousand.

382
01:00:04,865 --> 01:00:06,765
Yeah, but...

383
01:00:06,834 --> 01:00:10,031
there's a few more that'll
add up to more than that, I'm sure.

384
01:00:10,103 --> 01:00:13,368
- How do you know that?
- I have my information.

385
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:15,374
When all's said and done...

386
01:00:15,442 --> 01:00:18,502
I think I might just take you up
on your proposition.

387
01:00:21,716 --> 01:00:24,013
Let's drink to this partnership.

388
01:00:27,754 --> 01:00:31,019
To the partnership,
with no tricks, of course.

389
01:00:32,158 --> 01:00:33,853
>No tricks.

390
01:00:37,864 --> 01:00:39,263
>Now, then...

391
01:00:39,332 --> 01:00:43,736
you realize we're gonna have to figure
out some way to get them in the middle.

392
01:00:46,707 --> 01:00:50,642
One from the outside, one from
the inside. There's no other way.

393
01:00:50,710 --> 01:00:54,147
One of us will have to
join Indio's band.

394
01:00:56,316 --> 01:00:58,841
Why are you looking at me
when you say "one of us"?

395
01:00:58,919 --> 01:01:00,580
Because they don't know you.

396
01:01:00,654 --> 01:01:03,522
Wild sees me and his hump
will catch on fire.

397
01:01:06,127 --> 01:01:07,685
Tell me...

398
01:01:07,761 --> 01:01:10,924
how do you propose that I
join up with Indio?

399
01:01:10,997 --> 01:01:13,966
Maybe bring him
a bunch of roses?

400
01:01:14,035 --> 01:01:18,471
You could do that, but I'd suggest
you take him Sancho Perez.

401
01:01:18,538 --> 01:01:20,836
Who's Sancho Perez?

402
01:01:20,908 --> 01:01:23,843
A friend of Indio's.
Right now he's cooling off.

403
01:01:23,910 --> 01:01:26,538
He's cooling off
in Alamogourdo jail.

404
01:01:26,613 --> 01:01:29,173
How do you know all this?

405
01:01:30,383 --> 01:01:32,681
I've got my information too.

406
01:01:34,754 --> 01:01:38,781
>Naturally, you'll have to arrange
for his, uh, release.

407
01:01:41,528 --> 01:01:42,325
>Naturally.

408
01:01:44,832 --> 01:01:46,799
Tell me...

409
01:01:46,866 --> 01:01:49,334
were you ever young?

410
01:01:52,939 --> 01:01:55,134
And just as reckless as you.

411
01:01:58,546 --> 01:02:01,480
Then one day something happened.

412
01:02:01,548 --> 01:02:03,312
Made life very precious to me.

413
01:02:03,383 --> 01:02:04,975
What's that?

414
01:02:10,957 --> 01:02:13,357
Or is the question indiscreet?

415
01:02:16,363 --> 01:02:18,490
The question isn't indiscreet.

416
01:02:19,834 --> 01:02:21,825
But the answer could be.

417
01:05:36,162 --> 01:05:40,292
They told me you were put away. You'd be
resting for four long years in prison.

418
01:05:43,002 --> 01:05:46,939
>No, Indio, for four weeks.
>No more than four weeks.

419
01:05:58,585 --> 01:06:00,417
Who is that with you?

420
01:06:00,486 --> 01:06:03,614
He got me out.
The man's a friend of mine.

421
01:06:11,164 --> 01:06:14,133
Why did he help you?
Did you ask him that?

422
01:06:15,736 --> 01:06:19,136
Yeah. Amigo, why did you
help me out?

423
01:06:21,107 --> 01:06:26,238
Well, there's such a big reward
being offered on all you gentlemen...

424
01:06:26,312 --> 01:06:29,475
that I thought I might just tag along
on your next robbery.

425
01:06:30,750 --> 01:06:32,685
I might just turn you
into the law.

426
01:07:15,528 --> 01:07:17,120
Amigo...

427
01:07:18,765 --> 01:07:21,962
that's the one answer
that would prove you're all right.

428
01:07:24,171 --> 01:07:27,629
And you arrived just in time too.
The job is already set.

429
01:07:28,709 --> 01:07:30,267
It's tomorrow.

430
01:07:31,377 --> 01:07:33,470
The place is...

431
01:07:33,546 --> 01:07:35,980
the bank in El Paso.

432
01:07:38,318 --> 01:07:41,481
>Not far from El Paso
there's a little town, Santa Cruz.

433
01:07:41,555 --> 01:07:45,046
Tomorrow, Blackie, Chico,
Paco...

434
01:07:45,124 --> 01:07:48,287
and you, amigo...

435
01:07:48,361 --> 01:07:50,955
will rob the bank in Santa Cruz.

436
01:07:51,031 --> 01:07:54,193
Shoot, kill, get every gun
in the area after you...

437
01:07:54,267 --> 01:07:56,201
especially those from El Paso.

438
01:07:56,269 --> 01:07:59,671
Any others around,
we'll take care of them.

439
01:08:01,507 --> 01:08:04,477
And then after the job,
we'll all meet again at Las Palmeras.

440
01:08:08,948 --> 01:08:11,179
Where are you going?

441
01:08:17,224 --> 01:08:20,022
Well, if there's gonna be
any shooting...

442
01:08:21,095 --> 01:08:23,028
I gotta get my rest.

443
01:08:40,230 --> 01:08:44,860
Hey, amigo, you know when you told
that story yesterday, I fell for it.

444
01:08:44,935 --> 01:08:47,267
Big joke, wasn't it, amigo?

445
01:08:56,580 --> 01:08:58,411
Who said I was jokin'?

446
01:09:00,684 --> 01:09:02,652
I don't get that.
If it's true...

447
01:09:02,719 --> 01:09:05,153
Too bad you have to die.

448
01:09:09,326 --> 01:09:10,793
What is it?

449
01:10:06,650 --> 01:10:09,585
By now they should be
at Santa Cruz.

450
01:10:51,928 --> 01:10:53,452
Listen, shorty...

451
01:10:57,034 --> 01:11:00,834
Indio and his band have just
robbed the bank here in town.

452
01:11:00,904 --> 01:11:04,362
>Now why don't you just sit down
and send out the alarm to El Paso...

453
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:07,308
and the rest of the towns around here
and warn 'em, right?

454
01:11:07,377 --> 01:11:11,040
But, mister, I didn't hear any shots
at the bank, and I sure would have.

455
01:11:11,114 --> 01:11:13,047
You might hear one.

456
01:11:13,116 --> 01:11:14,743
The alarm.

457
01:11:58,261 --> 01:12:00,286
Easy now.

458
01:12:00,364 --> 01:12:03,060
They've robbed the bank
at Santa Cruz!

459
01:12:04,701 --> 01:12:06,395
Follow me!

460
01:13:44,668 --> 01:13:47,466
Groggy, the telegraph wires.

461
01:15:41,184 --> 01:15:43,345
- Good day, gentlemen.
- Good day, sir.

462
01:15:46,355 --> 01:15:48,688
- Sir.
- Good afternoon.

463
01:17:38,768 --> 01:17:40,462
The other side.

464
01:18:24,447 --> 01:18:26,346
Eleven...

465
01:18:26,416 --> 01:18:27,781
twelve...

466
01:18:30,787 --> 01:18:32,584
Fourteen...

467
01:21:13,950 --> 01:21:15,611
Let's go!

468
01:22:38,868 --> 01:22:42,167
What are you doin' here?
You're not runnin' away, are you?

469
01:22:42,238 --> 01:22:43,967
>No, I'm not running away.

470
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:47,703
I'm going after them and I'm going
alone. Our partnership is dissolved.

471
01:22:47,777 --> 01:22:49,608
Boy, let's wait
and talk it over.

472
01:22:49,679 --> 01:22:53,809
All we've done is talk.
I've been reasonable with no results.

473
01:22:53,882 --> 01:22:57,181
>Now take it easy. We only knew
the Santa Cruz part of this plan.

474
01:22:57,253 --> 01:23:00,381
You were the one who had
their strategy all worked out.

475
01:23:00,456 --> 01:23:03,084
- >Now I'm gonna meet Indio.
- I see. I better go along.

476
01:23:04,160 --> 01:23:06,094
I'm going alone... Me.

477
01:23:06,162 --> 01:23:09,563
I have an appointment with Indio
and I'm not gonna let anyone interfere.

478
01:23:09,632 --> 01:23:12,623
- You certain about that?
- That's right.

479
01:23:12,702 --> 01:23:15,170
In that case I'm sorry.

480
01:23:19,042 --> 01:23:23,741
That's not bad. Indio sent
four men to Santa Cruz.

481
01:23:23,813 --> 01:23:27,010
And one man returns...
a new man without a scratch.

482
01:23:27,083 --> 01:23:29,244
Mm-mm. Indio's no idiot.

483
01:23:29,318 --> 01:23:32,776
When you ride up to him and show him
that little nick, he might believe you.

484
01:23:33,855 --> 01:23:35,949
And don't forget,
that as of today...

485
01:23:36,025 --> 01:23:38,653
the whole gang's worth
$40,000 more.

486
01:23:38,728 --> 01:23:41,754
That's the reward offered by the bank
to get the money back.

487
01:23:41,831 --> 01:23:45,631
- Is the partnership operating again?
- Just how do you figure?

488
01:23:45,701 --> 01:23:50,604
Try to convince Indio to go north,
and then go along the Rio Bravo.

489
01:23:50,672 --> 01:23:53,870
It's a good spot for an ambush
and we can get him between two fires.

490
01:23:53,943 --> 01:23:57,743
You on the outside,
me on the inside, right?

491
01:23:59,114 --> 01:24:00,446
>North?

492
01:24:04,687 --> 01:24:06,177
>North.

493
01:24:25,341 --> 01:24:27,070
Hughie.

494
01:24:34,917 --> 01:24:39,377
Wait a minute. We need time to open it
and this isn't the right place.

495
01:25:08,951 --> 01:25:10,543
And the others?

496
01:25:10,620 --> 01:25:12,087
Dead?

497
01:25:13,288 --> 01:25:17,783
After Santa Cruz, we headed for El Paso
and they hit us from all sides.

498
01:25:19,262 --> 01:25:22,595
And you just saved your own skin,
isn't that right, you yellow...

499
01:25:42,151 --> 01:25:45,450
You did your part of it.
Let's go.

500
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:47,148
Which way we headed?

501
01:25:48,224 --> 01:25:49,589
>North.

502
01:25:49,659 --> 01:25:52,855
>North? Along Rio Bravo canyon?

503
01:25:52,929 --> 01:25:54,520
Why not?

504
01:25:55,898 --> 01:25:58,366
Seems like a good place
for an ambush to me.

505
01:26:00,469 --> 01:26:02,403
You know a better way to go?

506
01:26:02,471 --> 01:26:04,404
Yeah, south.

507
01:26:06,475 --> 01:26:08,102
Ride to the border?

508
01:26:08,177 --> 01:26:12,204
They'll never expect you to cross the
border now that the alarm's been sent.

509
01:26:18,688 --> 01:26:20,918
Think we'll head east.

510
01:26:20,989 --> 01:26:24,323
There's a place I know about,
Agua Caliente.

511
01:26:25,394 --> 01:26:28,386
Here we are.
That's Agua Caliente.

512
01:26:29,465 --> 01:26:32,297
Yes, I have many friends here.

513
01:26:32,368 --> 01:26:34,302
It looks just like a morgue.

514
01:26:35,471 --> 01:26:37,496
But look out.

515
01:26:37,573 --> 01:26:39,700
It could be one so easily.

516
01:26:40,977 --> 01:26:44,378
- They don't like strangers.
- >No, they don't like anybody.

517
01:26:46,248 --> 01:26:50,185
Wild, you never saw
our friend here shoot, right?

518
01:26:54,290 --> 01:26:56,019
Did any of you?

519
01:26:59,028 --> 01:27:01,690
We don't know how you'd be
in emergencies.

520
01:27:02,797 --> 01:27:05,358
I was thinking,
this is the right place.

521
01:27:05,434 --> 01:27:07,698
I got a way
you can show the men.

522
01:27:10,105 --> 01:27:11,630
How's that?

523
01:27:13,109 --> 01:27:14,872
Go into town alone, amigo.

524
01:30:01,510 --> 01:30:02,636
Bravo.

525
01:30:53,262 --> 01:30:56,026
Do you mind tellin' me
how you got here?

526
01:30:56,098 --> 01:30:58,658
I just reasoned it out.

527
01:30:58,734 --> 01:31:00,929
I figured you'd tell Indio...

528
01:31:01,003 --> 01:31:04,461
to do just exactly the opposite
of what we agreed...

529
01:31:04,540 --> 01:31:07,407
and he's suspicious enough
to figure out somethin' else.

530
01:31:08,644 --> 01:31:12,239
Since El Paso was out of the question,
well, here I am.

531
01:31:14,550 --> 01:31:16,415
Rum... a double.

532
01:31:17,486 --> 01:31:19,420
Tequila for all of us.

533
01:31:36,171 --> 01:31:38,901
If it isn't the smoker.

534
01:31:50,052 --> 01:31:52,384
Remember me, amigo?

535
01:31:54,556 --> 01:31:57,720
Of course you do. El Paso.

536
01:32:00,796 --> 01:32:03,264
It's a small world.

537
01:32:03,332 --> 01:32:06,062
Yes, and very, very bad.

538
01:32:07,169 --> 01:32:10,332
>Now, come on.
You light another match.

539
01:32:12,107 --> 01:32:16,407
I generally smoke just after I eat.
Come back in ten minutes.

540
01:32:16,478 --> 01:32:20,380
Ten minutes you'll be smoking
in hell. Get up!

541
01:32:20,449 --> 01:32:21,814
Stay calm.

542
01:32:24,119 --> 01:32:26,053
On your feet.

543
01:32:33,762 --> 01:32:35,422
Cucillo.

544
01:32:36,599 --> 01:32:38,089
Count to three.

545
01:32:48,010 --> 01:32:49,875
One...

546
01:32:51,714 --> 01:32:53,375
two...

547
01:32:55,017 --> 01:32:56,609
three!

548
01:33:00,355 --> 01:33:02,051
Stop it!

549
01:33:24,346 --> 01:33:26,041
Who are you?

550
01:33:27,616 --> 01:33:29,550
I'm the one who can open
the safe for you.

551
01:33:34,355 --> 01:33:35,755
What safe, senor?

552
01:33:35,824 --> 01:33:39,260
The one from El Paso.
You got there ahead of me.

553
01:33:39,328 --> 01:33:41,262
- However...
- However?

554
01:33:43,165 --> 01:33:46,931
Open that safe and you're gonna
destroy half the bank notes.

555
01:33:47,002 --> 01:33:49,527
I can open it
without blowing it up.

556
01:33:57,946 --> 01:33:59,413
What'll it cost?

557
01:33:59,480 --> 01:34:00,971
Five thousand.

558
01:34:04,620 --> 01:34:06,554
Two's all I'll pay you.

559
01:34:07,690 --> 01:34:09,385
Five.

560
01:34:46,562 --> 01:34:48,496
Keep your hands off it!

561
01:34:48,564 --> 01:34:52,022
It's easy to steal.
The trouble is in keeping the loot.

562
01:34:52,101 --> 01:34:54,364
Take it out.

563
01:34:54,436 --> 01:34:56,734
>Now every man in >New Mexico
is after us.

564
01:34:56,805 --> 01:35:00,468
If they catch one of us with money
we'll all end up the same way.

565
01:35:00,542 --> 01:35:04,444
We're going to wait here for an
entire month if I think it's necessary.

566
01:35:04,513 --> 01:35:07,482
Then everybody will get his share.

567
01:35:07,549 --> 01:35:09,915
And you will wait a month
to get your money.

568
01:35:11,253 --> 01:35:12,880
>Naturally.

569
01:35:12,955 --> 01:35:15,321
I'll be in the tavern.

570
01:35:15,390 --> 01:35:19,520
The air around here stinks anyway,
just like the food.

571
01:35:19,595 --> 01:35:21,563
But the month will go fast.

572
01:36:01,804 --> 01:36:03,237
Right here.

573
01:36:04,306 --> 01:36:05,898
Let's go.

574
01:38:30,218 --> 01:38:32,413
I was worried about you.

575
01:38:32,487 --> 01:38:36,355
All alone with, uh,
so many problems to solve.

576
01:38:52,975 --> 01:38:55,102
It's all right here.

577
01:39:00,449 --> 01:39:02,110
Go ahead.

578
01:40:10,452 --> 01:40:13,012
You shouldn't have shot
the apples off that tree.

579
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:26,433
Put it on.

580
01:42:33,134 --> 01:42:36,126
What's he doing now,
this sheriff of El Paso?

581
01:42:36,202 --> 01:42:39,468
Right now? Lookin' for the cash
that was in the bank.

582
01:42:40,608 --> 01:42:42,404
Right.

583
01:42:42,475 --> 01:42:47,277
And suppose he finds the bodies
of these men just outside El Paso...

584
01:42:47,348 --> 01:42:49,645
with lots of money on them?

585
01:42:51,184 --> 01:42:53,153
What will the sheriff think?

586
01:42:53,220 --> 01:42:55,017
Well, he...

587
01:42:55,089 --> 01:42:56,818
That's right.

588
01:44:14,003 --> 01:44:15,527
Slim.

589
01:44:18,774 --> 01:44:21,206
What is it, >Nino?

590
01:44:21,278 --> 01:44:25,007
A change of plans.

591
01:44:25,079 --> 01:44:28,309
Indio wants you to...

592
01:45:07,090 --> 01:45:09,023
It's not loaded.

593
01:45:32,814 --> 01:45:35,443
I think you should
get out fast now.

594
01:45:35,518 --> 01:45:38,782
Here's your guns without bullets.

595
01:45:38,854 --> 01:45:41,755
Listen. Don't you let Indio
find you both around.

596
01:46:30,473 --> 01:46:33,930
I know you don't like questions,
but why are you doing this?

597
01:46:36,946 --> 01:46:39,938
How long have you known
that Monco's a bounty killer?

598
01:46:41,850 --> 01:46:44,114
I found out tonight. Why?

599
01:46:47,322 --> 01:46:50,349
I knew he was one from
the first moment he arrived.

600
01:46:56,064 --> 01:46:59,000
The other one's also
a bounty killer.

601
01:47:00,603 --> 01:47:02,662
So I have an idea.

602
01:47:02,737 --> 01:47:04,898
They'll be useful to us.

603
01:47:06,242 --> 01:47:07,868
We'll try it.

604
01:47:08,944 --> 01:47:12,437
Those men are a lot better
than mine with a gun.

605
01:47:12,514 --> 01:47:16,781
So we'll let all of them
get mixed up in a gun battle.

606
01:47:16,853 --> 01:47:19,787
But that won't
really matter to me.

607
01:47:22,390 --> 01:47:23,915
Or you.

608
01:47:26,062 --> 01:47:29,087
Because we'll be far away, right?

609
01:47:34,569 --> 01:47:37,265
And we'll have all the money.

610
01:47:39,841 --> 01:47:41,639
Go on.

611
01:47:41,711 --> 01:47:43,940
Go on and wake Cucillo.

612
01:48:33,395 --> 01:48:34,727
Who did it?

613
01:48:34,796 --> 01:48:37,357
Why don't you look
at the knife?

614
01:48:45,640 --> 01:48:47,608
It's mine.

615
01:48:47,676 --> 01:48:50,645
Then it shouldn't be there,
should it?

616
01:49:00,255 --> 01:49:03,419
But I didn't kill him.
I didn't do it.

617
01:49:05,928 --> 01:49:08,590
It's difficult to prove that.

618
01:49:11,334 --> 01:49:12,823
I am innocent.

619
01:49:12,902 --> 01:49:15,426
One of your horses is outside.

620
01:49:16,505 --> 01:49:18,973
Let's see if you can get to it.

621
01:50:06,721 --> 01:50:08,211
He just killed Slim.

622
01:50:10,192 --> 01:50:14,424
And he... he helped those
two bounty killers get away.

623
01:50:18,233 --> 01:50:19,791
I want them back...

624
01:50:21,437 --> 01:50:23,131
right now.

625
01:50:36,051 --> 01:50:38,349
What are you doing here?

626
01:50:38,420 --> 01:50:40,912
Go and get them back!

627
01:50:45,161 --> 01:50:49,996
Those two bounty killers are sitting on
our backs and must be killed right away.

628
01:50:55,071 --> 01:50:57,005
We can't let 'em go free.

629
01:51:11,920 --> 01:51:13,479
It's done now.

630
01:51:15,491 --> 01:51:17,788
Prepare to get out of here.

631
01:52:00,736 --> 01:52:01,997
Here.

632
01:52:03,772 --> 01:52:05,433
Hold it.

633
01:52:10,045 --> 01:52:12,912
>Not a bad idea.

634
01:52:12,982 --> 01:52:15,506
But I'm one thing
you forgot about.

635
01:52:15,584 --> 01:52:17,278
Open it up now.

636
01:52:39,073 --> 01:52:41,304
All right, come on now,
open it.

637
01:53:39,715 --> 01:53:41,911
Leave Indio to me.

638
01:53:44,821 --> 01:53:46,345
All right.

639
01:54:18,688 --> 01:54:20,814
Where in hell is it?

640
01:54:49,085 --> 01:54:52,577
I'll kill 'em, but I'll rip
out their guts first.

641
01:54:52,654 --> 01:54:54,589
I have a plan.

642
01:55:01,029 --> 01:55:03,054
What?

643
01:55:03,132 --> 01:55:05,260
Let's just wait.

644
01:55:05,335 --> 01:55:07,461
They'll be back here.

645
01:55:09,505 --> 01:55:12,770
And this way,
there'll be two of us.

646
01:55:12,841 --> 01:55:16,005
Can they come back here?
Your men could've killed them.

647
01:55:16,078 --> 01:55:18,013
Who? They?

648
01:55:21,416 --> 01:55:25,011
Are you sure of that?
That they haven't?

649
01:55:28,625 --> 01:55:30,819
I thought something different.

650
01:55:30,894 --> 01:55:35,729
You made the boys ride on out to
make sure they're both killed, and fast.

651
01:55:35,799 --> 01:55:38,996
I'm not as dumb
as the rest of them.

652
01:55:40,170 --> 01:55:42,104
There was no help for it.

653
01:57:15,631 --> 01:57:17,156
Go on.

654
01:59:05,140 --> 01:59:06,573
That watch...

655
01:59:08,044 --> 01:59:10,841
It's been a long time
that I wanted to ask.

656
01:59:12,314 --> 01:59:15,078
I can see that it means
a lot to you.

657
01:59:15,151 --> 01:59:16,675
Why?

658
02:00:53,381 --> 02:00:54,974
Listen to me!

659
02:00:56,818 --> 02:00:58,979
This is Colonel Mortimer!

660
02:01:01,590 --> 02:01:03,218
Douglas Mortimer!

661
02:01:05,495 --> 02:01:07,894
Does the name
mean anything to you?

662
02:02:40,456 --> 02:02:43,687
When the chimes end,
pick up your gun.

663
02:02:43,759 --> 02:02:46,125
Try and shoot me, Colonel.

664
02:02:48,764 --> 02:02:50,788
Just try.

665
02:04:45,880 --> 02:04:48,281
Very careless of you, old man.

666
02:05:14,510 --> 02:05:16,136
Try this.

667
02:05:23,285 --> 02:05:25,219
>Now we start.

668
02:07:15,864 --> 02:07:17,162
Bravo.

669
02:07:58,741 --> 02:08:01,335
There seems to be
a family resemblance.

670
02:08:07,715 --> 02:08:09,308
Here.

671
02:08:13,956 --> 02:08:16,947
>Naturally, between
brother and sister.

672
02:08:17,026 --> 02:08:18,617
My gun.

673
02:08:23,698 --> 02:08:24,961
My boy...

674
02:08:26,035 --> 02:08:28,401
you've become rich.

675
02:08:28,470 --> 02:08:31,131
You mean we've become rich,
old man.

676
02:08:31,206 --> 02:08:34,265
>No, it's all for you.
I think you deserve it.

677
02:08:35,376 --> 02:08:37,709
What about our partnership?

678
02:08:40,148 --> 02:08:41,809
Maybe next time.

679
02:09:24,492 --> 02:09:28,724
Ten thousand, twelve thousand...

680
02:09:28,796 --> 02:09:30,196
fifteen...

681
02:09:31,265 --> 02:09:32,926
sixteen...

682
02:09:33,001 --> 02:09:34,299
seventeen...

683
02:09:36,037 --> 02:09:38,268
twenty-two...

684
02:09:45,714 --> 02:09:47,738
Twenty-seven.

685
02:09:49,417 --> 02:09:50,885
Any trouble, boy?

686
02:09:53,455 --> 02:09:55,046
>No, old man.

687
02:09:56,425 --> 02:09:59,484
Thought I was having trouble
with my adding.

688
02:09:59,560 --> 02:10:00,960
It's all right now.
