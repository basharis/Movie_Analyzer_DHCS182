0
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:42,701
<i>I shall tell you of William Wallace.</i>

1
00:01:43,736 --> 00:01:47,137
<i>Historians from England</i>
<i>will say I am a liar,</i>

2
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:51,301
<i>but history is written by those</i>
<i>who have hanged heroes.</i>

3
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:55,906
<i>The king of Scotland</i>
<i>had died without a son,</i>

4
00:01:56,015 --> 00:01:57,642
<i>and the king of England,</i>

5
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:01,311
<i>a cruel pagan known</i>
<i>as Edward the Longshanks,</i>

6
00:02:01,654 --> 00:02:04,487
<i>claimed the throne of Scotland</i>
<i>for himself.</i>

7
00:02:05,391 --> 00:02:07,484
<i>Scotland's nobles fought him</i>

8
00:02:07,994 --> 00:02:10,929
<i>and fought each other over the crown.</i>

9
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:15,096
<i>So Longshanks invited them</i>
<i>to talks of truce,</i>

10
00:02:15,568 --> 00:02:18,366
<i>no weapons, one page only.</i>

11
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:25,536
<i>Among the farmers of that shire</i>
<i>was Malcolm Wallace,</i>

12
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:27,442
<i>a commoner with his own lands.</i>

13
00:02:27,547 --> 00:02:30,141
<i>He had two sons, John and William.</i>

14
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:39,420
I told you to stay.

15
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,987
Well, I finished my work.

16
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:44,154
Where are we going?

17
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:47,427
MacAndrews'. He was supposed to visit
when the gathering was over.

18
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:49,661
-Can I come?
-No. Go home, boy.

19
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:51,100
But I want to go.

20
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:53,866
Go home, William,
or you'll feel the back of my hand.

21
00:02:53,973 --> 00:02:56,100
Go you home, William.

22
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:21,733
MacAndrews!

23
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:28,196
MacAndrews!

24
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:38,009
Holy Jesus.

25
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:24,993
-It's all right!
-William! William!

26
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:29,124
William! William, it's all right.

27
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:31,601
It's all right. Easy, lad.

28
00:04:47,887 --> 00:04:49,115
William.

29
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:54,155
And I say we hit back now!

30
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:57,024
-We cannot fight them! It's suicide!
-Something's got to be done.

31
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,826
Wallace is right! We fight them!

32
00:04:59,932 --> 00:05:02,628
Every nobleman who had a will to fight
was at that meeting.

33
00:05:02,735 --> 00:05:03,929
We cannot beat an army.

34
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:05,732
Not with 50 farmers.

35
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:09,035
We do not have to beat them,
just fight them.

36
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:11,605
Now, who's with me?

37
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:13,611
I am, Wallace.

38
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:15,576
All right, all right.

39
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:16,808
Ready.

40
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:33,095
Where do you think you're going?

41
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,564
I'm going with you.

42
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:36,862
You're going with me, are you?

43
00:05:36,969 --> 00:05:40,268
-And what are you going to do?
-I'm gonna help.

44
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:42,603
And a good help you'd be, too,

45
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:47,539
but I need you to stay here
and look after the place for me

46
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,046
while I'm away.

47
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,674
I can fight.

48
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:58,649
I know. I know you can fight.

49
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:06,690
But it's our wits that make us men.

50
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:13,198
See you tomorrow.

51
00:06:44,303 --> 00:06:45,998
-English.
-Get down.

52
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:51,175
With your father and brother gone,
they'll kill us and burn the farm.

53
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:53,669
It's up to us, Hamish.

54
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:13,157
Nah.

55
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:00,412
Da?

56
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:07,908
Da?

57
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,191
William.

58
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:27,323
Come here, lad.

59
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:58,818
Amen.

60
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:00,620
-Amen.
-Amen.

61
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:55,368
William.

62
00:12:57,309 --> 00:12:59,834
I'm your uncle. Argyle.

63
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:15,425
You have the look of your mother.

64
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,467
We'll stay here tonight.

65
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:30,906
Tomorrow you'll come home with me.

66
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,875
I don't want to leave.

67
00:13:33,946 --> 00:13:37,245
You didn't want your father to die either,
did you?

68
00:13:37,349 --> 00:13:38,941
But it happened.

69
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:45,485
Did the priest give a poetic benediction?

70
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:47,825
''The Lord bless thee and keep thee''?

71
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:49,758
It was in Latin.

72
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:51,420
You don't speak Latin?

73
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:56,596
Well, that's something
we shall have to remedy, isn't it?

74
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:02,669
The Lord bless thee and keep thee.

75
00:14:04,109 --> 00:14:07,442
The Lord cause his light
to shine on thee.

76
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:10,709
The Lord lift up
his countenance upon thee

77
00:14:10,816 --> 00:14:12,875
and give thee peace.

78
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:15,246
Amen.

79
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:23,356
Your heart is free.

80
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:27,427
Have the courage to follow it.

81
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,885
What are they doing?

82
00:14:56,996 --> 00:15:00,193
Saying goodbye in their own way.

83
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:03,757
Playing outlawed tunes
on outlawed pipes.

84
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:18,106
It was the same for me and your daddy
when our father was killed.

85
00:15:45,644 --> 00:15:50,172
First, learn to use this.

86
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:56,087
Then I'll teach you to use this.

87
00:16:26,618 --> 00:16:28,051
<i>Many years later,</i>

88
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:31,088
<i>Edward the Longshanks,</i>
<i>King of England,</i>

89
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:33,920
<i>supervised the wedding</i>
<i>of his eldest son,</i>

90
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:36,586
<i>who would succeed him to the throne.</i>

91
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:40,628
Amen.

92
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:46,968
<i>As bride for his son,</i>

93
00:16:47,072 --> 00:16:50,439
<i>Longshanks had chosen the daughter</i>
<i>of his rival,</i>

94
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:52,305
<i>the King of France.</i>

95
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:19,628
<i>It was widely whispered</i>
<i>that for the princess to conceive,</i>

96
00:17:19,738 --> 00:17:22,798
<i>Longshanks would have to do</i>
<i>the honors himself.</i>

97
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:26,805
<i>That may have been</i>
<i>what he had in mind all along.</i>

98
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:34,842
Scotland. My land.

99
00:17:37,322 --> 00:17:41,486
The French will grovel
to anyone with strength,

100
00:17:42,294 --> 00:17:44,592
but how will they believe our strength

101
00:17:44,696 --> 00:17:47,790
when we cannot rule
the whole of our own island?

102
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:00,271
Where is my son?

103
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:03,906
Your pardon, milord.
He asked me to come in his stead.

104
00:18:04,716 --> 00:18:06,775
I sent for him, and he sends you.

105
00:18:07,719 --> 00:18:09,584
Shall I leave, milord?

106
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:14,390
If he wants his queen
to rule when I am gone,

107
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:17,519
then, by all means, stay and learn how.

108
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:19,091
Please.

109
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:24,596
Nobles.

110
00:18:25,337 --> 00:18:28,670
Nobles are the key
to the door of Scotland.

111
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:32,436
Grant our nobles lands in the north,

112
00:18:32,544 --> 00:18:36,378
give their nobles
estates here in England,

113
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:38,780
and make them too greedy
to oppose us.

114
00:18:38,884 --> 00:18:41,944
But, sire,
our nobles will be reluctant to uproot.

115
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:44,386
New lands mean new taxes,

116
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:46,481
and they're already taxed
for the war in France.

117
00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:47,889
Are they?

118
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:50,725
Are they?

119
00:19:09,581 --> 00:19:13,915
The trouble with Scotland
is that it's full of Scots.

120
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:23,189
Perhaps the time has come
to reinstitute an old custom.

121
00:19:24,062 --> 00:19:26,929
Grant them <i>prima nocte.</i>

122
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:30,967
First night.

123
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:34,897
When any common girl inhabiting
their lands is married,

124
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:41,310
our nobles shall have sexual rights
to her on the night of her wedding.

125
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:47,950
If we can't get them out,
we'll breed them out.

126
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:53,387
That should fetch just the kind of lords
we want to Scotland,

127
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:55,255
taxes or no taxes.

128
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:59,322
-A most excellent idea, sire.
-Is it?

129
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:08,533
<i>Now in Edinburgh were gathered</i>
<i>the council of Scottish nobles.</i>

130
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:13,043
<i>Among these was Robert,</i>
<i>the 17th Earl of Bruce,</i>

131
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:16,907
<i>a leading contender for the crown</i>
<i>of Scotland.</i>

132
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:26,556
I hear that Longshanks
has granted <i>prima nocte.</i>

133
00:20:27,492 --> 00:20:30,723
Clearly meant to draw more
of his supporters here.

134
00:20:31,496 --> 00:20:36,058
My father believes that we must
lull Longshanks into our confidence

135
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:38,136
by neither supporting his decree
nor opposing it.

136
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,795
A wise plan.

137
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:42,066
And how is your father?
We missed him at the council.

138
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:45,007
His affairs in France
keep him long overdue.

139
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:52,377
But he sends his greetings,

140
00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:56,420
and he says that I speak
for all of the Bruces and for Scotland.

141
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:09,519
It's all over now.

142
00:23:09,621 --> 00:23:11,521
You've dropped your rock.

143
00:23:11,623 --> 00:23:13,056
Test of manhood.

144
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,388
You win.

145
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:20,729
Call it a test of soldiery, then.

146
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:23,232
The English won't let us train
with weapons,

147
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:24,700
so we train with stones.

148
00:23:24,803 --> 00:23:28,637
The test of a soldier is not in his arm.
It's here.

149
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,708
No. It's here.

150
00:23:37,716 --> 00:23:38,910
Hamish?

151
00:23:52,998 --> 00:23:54,022
Here you go, Son.

152
00:23:54,132 --> 00:23:55,121
Show him how.

153
00:23:55,233 --> 00:23:56,530
Come on, Hamish!

154
00:23:58,370 --> 00:23:59,997
You'll never beat Hamish.

155
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:02,096
Come on there, boy!

156
00:24:13,418 --> 00:24:14,407
My boy!

157
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:16,646
That's a good throw.

158
00:24:16,755 --> 00:24:18,382
Aye. Aye, it was.

159
00:24:19,224 --> 00:24:22,625
I was wondering if you could do that
when it matters.

160
00:24:25,263 --> 00:24:27,254
As it matters in battle.

161
00:24:29,367 --> 00:24:31,801
Could you crush a man with that throw?

162
00:24:31,903 --> 00:24:34,394
I could crush you like a worm.

163
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:38,973
-You could?
-Aye.

164
00:24:39,911 --> 00:24:40,935
Well, then, do it.

165
00:24:41,046 --> 00:24:42,809
Would you like to see him crush me
like a worm?

166
00:24:42,914 --> 00:24:43,881
Aye.

167
00:24:47,886 --> 00:24:49,615
-Come do it.
-You'll move.

168
00:24:49,721 --> 00:24:51,086
I will not.

169
00:24:51,857 --> 00:24:53,154
Right.

170
00:24:53,258 --> 00:24:54,282
He'll move.

171
00:24:54,392 --> 00:24:56,360
Come on, Hamish.

172
00:24:57,662 --> 00:24:59,425
Come on there, boy!

173
00:25:07,873 --> 00:25:09,204
Well done!

174
00:25:23,221 --> 00:25:25,246
Fine display, young Wallace.

175
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:26,915
Are you all right?

176
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:29,016
You look a wee bit shaky.

177
00:25:29,995 --> 00:25:33,192
-I should have remembered the rocks.
-Aye, you should have.

178
00:25:38,603 --> 00:25:40,867
Get up, you big heap.

179
00:25:40,972 --> 00:25:42,371
It's good to see you again.

180
00:25:42,474 --> 00:25:44,169
Aye. Welcome home.

181
00:25:46,478 --> 00:25:48,810
-Got my head.
-Well, you should have moved.

182
00:26:00,258 --> 00:26:02,692
William, will you dance with me?

183
00:26:04,095 --> 00:26:05,722
Of course I will.

184
00:26:30,956 --> 00:26:33,891
I've come to claim the right
of <i>prima nocte.</i>

185
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:38,126
As lord of these lands,
I will bless this marriage

186
00:26:38,229 --> 00:26:43,223
by taking the bride into my bed
on the first night of her union.

187
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:45,166
By God, you will not!

188
00:26:48,907 --> 00:26:50,966
It is my noble right.

189
00:28:52,764 --> 00:28:53,992
Good evening, sir.

190
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:55,623
Young Wallace.

191
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:59,969
-Grand soft evening, huh?
-Aye, it's that.

192
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:03,700
I was wondering if I might have a word
with your daughter.

193
00:29:04,509 --> 00:29:06,773
What do you want
to have a word with her about?

194
00:29:06,878 --> 00:29:07,845
Well...

195
00:29:08,513 --> 00:29:12,609
Murron, would you like to come
and ride with me on this fine evening?

196
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:17,113
In this? You're out of your mind.

197
00:29:17,222 --> 00:29:20,385
It's good Scottish weather, madam.
The rain is falling straight down.

198
00:29:20,492 --> 00:29:21,959
Slightly to the side, like.

199
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:24,722
-She can't go with you.
-No?

200
00:29:24,829 --> 00:29:27,093
No the now, anyway.

201
00:29:27,198 --> 00:29:29,166
-No the now.
-No the now?

202
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:30,325
We'll see you later.

203
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:32,460
The weather's just fine.
It's hardly raining.

204
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:34,902
Did you not hear what I said?

205
00:29:35,006 --> 00:29:37,702
-Murron!
-Murron! Get...

206
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:41,643
It's you she takes after.

207
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:13,901
How did you know me after so long?

208
00:30:14,012 --> 00:30:15,445
I didn't.

209
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:18,878
It's just... I saw you staring at me,
and I didn't know who you were.

210
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:21,076
I'm sorry. I suppose I was.

211
00:30:23,888 --> 00:30:26,857
Are you in the habit of riding off
in the rain with strangers?

212
00:30:26,958 --> 00:30:30,257
It was the best way to make you leave.

213
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:35,160
If I can ever work up the courage
to ask you again,

214
00:30:35,266 --> 00:30:36,665
I'll send you a written warning first.

215
00:30:36,768 --> 00:30:38,736
That wouldn't do you much good.
I can't read.

216
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:40,828
-Can you not?
-No.

217
00:30:43,741 --> 00:30:46,301
Well, that's something
we shall have to remedy, isn't it?

218
00:30:46,411 --> 00:30:49,141
-You're going to teach me to read, then?
-lf you like.

219
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:52,009
-Aye.
-In what language?

220
00:30:53,818 --> 00:30:55,217
You're showing off now.

221
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:58,289
-That's right. Are you impressed yet?
-No. Why? Should I be?

222
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:10,130
Do that standing on your head,
and I'll be impressed.

223
00:31:10,501 --> 00:31:12,492
My kilt will fly up, but I'll try it.

224
00:31:12,604 --> 00:31:14,868
God, you certainly didn't learn
any manners on your travels.

225
00:31:14,973 --> 00:31:17,703
The French and the Romans
have far worse manners than I.

226
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:20,972
-You've been to Rome?
-Aye, Argyle took me on a pilgrimage.

227
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:22,740
What was it like?

228
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:30,046
What does that mean?

229
00:31:30,154 --> 00:31:31,485
Beautiful.

230
00:31:34,826 --> 00:31:36,487
But I belong here.

231
00:32:09,627 --> 00:32:11,595
Murron? Come in now.

232
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:26,232
Sir, I know it was strange of me
to invite Murron to ride last night,

233
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:27,304
but I assure you...

234
00:33:27,405 --> 00:33:30,169
MacClannough's daughter
is another matter.

235
00:33:30,274 --> 00:33:32,936
I've come to fetch you to our meeting.

236
00:33:33,711 --> 00:33:36,043
-What kind of meeting?
-The secret kind.

237
00:33:36,147 --> 00:33:39,048
Your meetings are a waste of time,
Campbell.

238
00:33:40,752 --> 00:33:44,153
Your father was a fighter and a patriot.

239
00:33:47,058 --> 00:33:49,083
I know who my father was.

240
00:33:50,395 --> 00:33:54,161
I came back home to raise crops
and, God willing, a family.

241
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:58,596
-lf I can live in peace, I will.
-Go on.

242
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:00,637
You say you want to stay out
of the troubles?

243
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:01,839
Aye.

244
00:34:01,939 --> 00:34:04,499
If you can prove it,
you may court my daughter.

245
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:07,043
Until you prove it, my answer's no.

246
00:34:07,145 --> 00:34:08,305
No?

247
00:34:08,413 --> 00:34:10,005
No, Wallace. No.

248
00:34:10,481 --> 00:34:12,779
-Didn't I just prove it?
-No!

249
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:14,681
-No?
-No!

250
00:34:56,794 --> 00:34:59,888
Of course,
running a farm's a lot of work,

251
00:34:59,997 --> 00:35:02,932
but that will all change
when my sons arrive.

252
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:06,036
So you've got children?

253
00:35:06,137 --> 00:35:09,834
Not yet, but I was hoping
that you could help me with that.

254
00:35:10,741 --> 00:35:11,943
So you want me to marry you, then?

255
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:12,466
So you want me to marry you, then?

256
00:35:12,577 --> 00:35:14,909
It's a bit sudden, but all right.

257
00:35:15,012 --> 00:35:17,412
Is that what you call a proposal?

258
00:35:18,549 --> 00:35:21,279
I love you. Always have.

259
00:35:23,654 --> 00:35:25,383
I want to marry you.

260
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:39,034
Is that a yes?

261
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:41,264
-Aye, that's a yes.
-It is?

262
00:36:24,315 --> 00:36:26,340
We best hurry. He'll be waiting.

263
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:28,577
-Wait.
-Where are you going?

264
00:36:34,959 --> 00:36:36,984
-What's that?
-You'll see.

265
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,379
Father.

266
00:37:10,161 --> 00:37:12,425
I will love you my whole life,

267
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:15,392
you and no other.

268
00:37:20,838 --> 00:37:22,169
And I you,

269
00:37:23,107 --> 00:37:25,132
you and no other, forever.

270
00:40:53,851 --> 00:40:55,375
When am I going to see you again?

271
00:40:55,486 --> 00:40:56,919
Tonight?

272
00:40:57,021 --> 00:40:59,046
-I can't.
-Why not?

273
00:40:59,156 --> 00:41:00,248
My dad's growing suspicious.

274
00:41:00,357 --> 00:41:01,483
Growing suspicious, is he?

275
00:41:01,592 --> 00:41:03,321
Wouldn't have anything to do with that,
would it?

276
00:41:03,427 --> 00:41:05,122
When? When? When?

277
00:41:06,864 --> 00:41:08,695
-When?
-Tonight.

278
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:10,960
-Tonight.
-Tonight.

279
00:41:18,108 --> 00:41:20,042
Look lively, Sergeant.

280
00:41:31,388 --> 00:41:33,083
Where are you going, lassie?

281
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:34,282
That looks heavy.

282
00:41:34,391 --> 00:41:36,655
-Let me help you with it.
-No. It's fine.

283
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:39,160
I'm not going to steal it.

284
00:41:41,565 --> 00:41:44,466
You remind me
of my daughter back home.

285
00:41:57,281 --> 00:41:58,578
Hello, lassie.

286
00:42:13,397 --> 00:42:15,297
No! No!

287
00:42:18,168 --> 00:42:20,534
Keep it quiet, Smythe.

288
00:42:24,008 --> 00:42:25,669
You bitch!

289
00:42:32,983 --> 00:42:34,507
You bitch!

290
00:42:43,127 --> 00:42:44,219
Are you all right?

291
00:42:44,328 --> 00:42:46,193
All right? Come on.

292
00:42:48,699 --> 00:42:49,859
-Are you all right?
-Aye.

293
00:42:49,967 --> 00:42:51,628
Are you all right?

294
00:43:00,811 --> 00:43:02,540
-Can you ride?
-Aye.

295
00:43:07,351 --> 00:43:10,047
Come back here, you bastard!

296
00:43:10,888 --> 00:43:12,287
Raise the alarm!

297
00:43:12,389 --> 00:43:13,754
Help!

298
00:43:14,391 --> 00:43:16,518
Meet me at the grove. Ride!

299
00:43:16,994 --> 00:43:18,894
They're getting away!

300
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:26,736
Go round back!

301
00:43:43,354 --> 00:43:44,616
Get her!

302
00:43:45,489 --> 00:43:47,855
Come on!

303
00:44:02,606 --> 00:44:03,573
You bitch!

304
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:28,131
Murron?

305
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:36,973
Murron!

306
00:44:45,549 --> 00:44:48,074
All of you know full well

307
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:50,585
the great pains I've always taken

308
00:44:51,422 --> 00:44:55,984
never to be too strict, too rigid
with the application of our laws.

309
00:44:56,894 --> 00:44:58,885
And as a consequence,

310
00:44:58,996 --> 00:45:02,159
have we not learned to live together

311
00:45:02,266 --> 00:45:04,496
in relative peace and harmony?

312
00:45:10,441 --> 00:45:15,970
And this day's lawlessness
is how you repay my leniency!

313
00:45:25,355 --> 00:45:27,755
Well, you leave me with little choice.

314
00:45:35,632 --> 00:45:38,066
An assault on the king's soldiers

315
00:45:39,436 --> 00:45:42,462
is the same as an assault
on the king himself.

316
00:45:58,822 --> 00:46:00,722
Now,

317
00:46:00,824 --> 00:46:03,452
let this scrapper come to me.

318
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:50,898
Sir!

319
00:46:59,449 --> 00:47:00,677
There.

320
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:28,551
Corporal.

321
00:50:28,658 --> 00:50:30,990
Some archers on the tower. Now!

322
00:50:40,804 --> 00:50:42,567
Hold still, Father.

323
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:45,265
You're an idiot, boy!

324
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:11,122
Father, you all right?

325
00:53:34,311 --> 00:53:35,676
MacAulish.

326
00:53:38,081 --> 00:53:39,605
MacAulish.

327
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:43,250
MacAulish!

328
00:53:44,387 --> 00:53:47,379
MacAulish! MacAulish!

329
00:53:48,091 --> 00:53:52,084
-MacAulish! MacAulish!
-Wallace! Wallace!

330
00:53:52,195 --> 00:53:54,322
Wallace! Wallace!

331
00:53:54,431 --> 00:53:57,696
Wallace! Wallace! Wallace!

332
00:53:57,801 --> 00:54:00,964
Wallace! Wallace! Wallace!

333
00:56:16,573 --> 00:56:18,598
What you waiting for, boy?

334
00:56:19,909 --> 00:56:22,673
Here. You can do it. I'll hold him down.

335
00:56:24,714 --> 00:56:26,511
Here. You can do it.

336
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:28,084
I'll hold him down.

337
00:56:28,084 --> 00:56:28,641
I'll hold him down.

338
00:56:28,752 --> 00:56:30,413
Pour it straight in the wound, boy.

339
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:32,579
I know it seems like a waste
of good whiskey.

340
00:56:32,689 --> 00:56:34,088
Indulge me.

341
00:56:37,794 --> 00:56:39,125
Hold him. Hold him.

342
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:42,096
Hold him. Now let him go.

343
00:56:43,299 --> 00:56:45,164
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

344
00:56:48,972 --> 00:56:51,736
That'll wake you up in the morning, boy.

345
00:56:51,841 --> 00:56:53,433
There's somebody coming!

346
00:56:53,543 --> 00:56:55,306
Arm yourselves!

347
00:57:01,151 --> 00:57:03,142
There's somebody coming.

348
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:06,453
MacGregors, from the next glen.

349
00:57:12,228 --> 00:57:14,719
We heard about what was happening.

350
00:57:14,831 --> 00:57:18,426
We don't want you <i>amadans</i> thinking
you can have your fun without us.

351
00:57:18,535 --> 00:57:19,900
-That's right.
-Aye.

352
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:22,032
Go home.

353
00:57:23,173 --> 00:57:25,107
Some of us are in this.

354
00:57:25,842 --> 00:57:27,742
Can't help that now.

355
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:31,414
But you can help yourselves. Go home.

356
00:57:31,514 --> 00:57:34,210
We'll have no homes left when
the English garrison from the castle

357
00:57:34,317 --> 00:57:37,047
comes through and burns us out.

358
00:57:37,153 --> 00:57:39,621
-And they will.
-Aye.

359
00:57:41,691 --> 00:57:43,022
Welcome.

360
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:15,124
Patrol returning, milord!

361
00:58:42,919 --> 00:58:44,648
So what news?

362
00:58:56,466 --> 00:58:59,196
I have dispatched
100 soldiers to Lanark.

363
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:01,527
They will be returning now!

364
00:59:01,638 --> 00:59:04,072
Were they dressed like this?

365
00:59:04,908 --> 00:59:07,433
Actually, it was more like 50.

366
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:09,011
Make it quick.

367
00:59:11,814 --> 00:59:13,406
You remember me?

368
00:59:14,918 --> 00:59:17,250
I never did her any harm.
It was my right.

369
00:59:17,353 --> 00:59:18,377
Your right?

370
00:59:18,488 --> 00:59:21,252
Well, I'm here to claim the right
of a husband!

371
00:59:28,331 --> 00:59:30,299
I am William Wallace,

372
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:35,367
and the rest of you will be spared.

373
00:59:35,471 --> 00:59:38,201
Go back to England and tell them there

374
00:59:39,075 --> 00:59:42,636
that Scotland's daughters
and her sons are yours no more.

375
00:59:44,847 --> 00:59:47,315
Tell them Scotland is free.

376
00:59:53,156 --> 00:59:54,646
Burn it.

377
01:00:08,972 --> 01:00:10,166
Good job, milord.

378
01:00:28,491 --> 01:00:32,985
Scottish rebels have routed
one of my garrisons

379
01:00:33,096 --> 01:00:35,326
and murdered the noble lord.

380
01:00:35,431 --> 01:00:36,864
I heard.

381
01:00:36,966 --> 01:00:39,662
This Wallace is a brigand,
nothing more.

382
01:00:40,236 --> 01:00:42,864
And how would you deal
with this brigand?

383
01:00:42,972 --> 01:00:44,371
Like any common thief.

384
01:00:44,474 --> 01:00:48,205
Have the local magistrate arrest him
and punish him accordingly.

385
01:00:50,780 --> 01:00:52,077
Leave us.

386
01:01:03,126 --> 01:01:05,856
Wallace has already killed
the magistrate

387
01:01:05,962 --> 01:01:08,089
and taken control of the town.

388
01:01:08,898 --> 01:01:10,490
Stand up.

389
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:11,897
Stand up.

390
01:01:12,869 --> 01:01:14,700
In the morning,

391
01:01:15,838 --> 01:01:18,864
I depart for France
to press our rights there,

392
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:22,240
and I leave you here
to quell this little rebellion.

393
01:01:22,345 --> 01:01:24,006
Understood? Is it?

394
01:01:28,351 --> 01:01:30,512
One day, you will be a king,

395
01:01:32,288 --> 01:01:34,518
at least try to act like one.

396
01:01:38,394 --> 01:01:40,021
Get away from me!

397
01:01:40,763 --> 01:01:42,924
Convene my military council.

398
01:02:24,373 --> 01:02:25,772
There!

399
01:02:28,511 --> 01:02:29,876
After them.

400
01:02:57,173 --> 01:02:58,333
No point resisting.

401
01:02:58,441 --> 01:03:00,306
You're outnumbered and trapped.

402
01:03:00,409 --> 01:03:03,503
Now, where are the rest of you?
Where's Wallace?

403
01:03:15,725 --> 01:03:16,987
Father?

404
01:03:17,093 --> 01:03:19,061
Come in. Come in.

405
01:03:19,862 --> 01:03:21,921
A rebellion has begun.

406
01:03:28,638 --> 01:03:29,935
Under whom?

407
01:03:30,039 --> 01:03:33,133
A commoner named William Wallace.

408
01:03:44,086 --> 01:03:46,520
You will embrace this rebellion.

409
01:03:46,923 --> 01:03:49,721
Support it from our lands in the north.

410
01:03:50,293 --> 01:03:52,386
I will gain English favor

411
01:03:52,495 --> 01:03:57,455
by condemning it and ordering it
opposed from our lands in the south.

412
01:03:59,302 --> 01:04:01,361
Sit down. Stay awhile.

413
01:04:08,845 --> 01:04:10,403
This Wallace,

414
01:04:12,248 --> 01:04:16,412
he doesn't even have a knighthood,
but he fights with passion,

415
01:04:16,519 --> 01:04:18,077
and he inspires.

416
01:04:18,754 --> 01:04:21,746
And you wish to charge off
and fight as he did?

417
01:04:23,159 --> 01:04:24,751
So would I.

418
01:04:24,927 --> 01:04:26,360
Well, maybe it's time.

419
01:04:26,462 --> 01:04:29,397
It is time to survive.

420
01:04:30,233 --> 01:04:32,463
You're the 17th Robert Bruce.

421
01:04:33,102 --> 01:04:38,904
The 16 before you passed you land
and title because they didn't charge in.

422
01:04:40,910 --> 01:04:43,743
-Call a meeting of the nobles.
-They do nothing but talk.

423
01:04:43,846 --> 01:04:44,972
Rightly so.

424
01:04:45,081 --> 01:04:47,948
They're as rich in English titles
and lands as they are in Scottish.

425
01:04:48,050 --> 01:04:49,483
Just as we are.

426
01:04:49,585 --> 01:04:52,554
You admire this man,
this William Wallace.

427
01:04:52,655 --> 01:04:55,249
Uncompromising men
are easy to admire.

428
01:04:55,758 --> 01:04:58,090
He has courage, so does a dog.

429
01:04:58,194 --> 01:05:01,220
But it is exactly
the ability to compromise

430
01:05:01,330 --> 01:05:03,298
that makes a man noble.

431
01:05:03,966 --> 01:05:05,558
And understand this,

432
01:05:05,668 --> 01:05:08,228
Edward Longshanks
is the most ruthless king

433
01:05:08,337 --> 01:05:11,033
ever to sit on the throne of England,

434
01:05:11,140 --> 01:05:17,636
and none of us and nothing of Scotland
will remain unless we are as ruthless.

435
01:05:19,315 --> 01:05:21,249
Give ear to our nobles.

436
01:05:22,318 --> 01:05:26,721
Knowing their minds
is the key to the throne.

437
01:05:43,205 --> 01:05:46,038
Wait. Wait. Look.

438
01:05:46,809 --> 01:05:49,107
-This is out, and this is left.
-Of course.

439
01:05:49,211 --> 01:05:50,473
Carry on.

440
01:05:50,579 --> 01:05:52,046
Carry on!

441
01:07:34,583 --> 01:07:35,845
You know,

442
01:07:35,951 --> 01:07:39,079
eventually, Longshanks will send
his whole northern army against us.

443
01:07:39,188 --> 01:07:41,486
Heavy cavalry, armored horse.

444
01:07:42,024 --> 01:07:43,889
Shake the very ground.

445
01:07:45,027 --> 01:07:46,619
They'll ride right over us.

446
01:07:46,729 --> 01:07:49,254
Uncle Argyle used to talk about it,

447
01:07:49,365 --> 01:07:52,732
how no army had ever stood up
to a charge of heavy horse.

448
01:07:52,835 --> 01:07:56,430
-So what do we do?
-Hit, run, hide, the Highland way.

449
01:08:04,647 --> 01:08:06,171
We'll make spears.

450
01:08:07,450 --> 01:08:08,849
Hundreds of them.

451
01:08:08,951 --> 01:08:11,852
Long spears, twice as long as a man.

452
01:08:11,954 --> 01:08:13,979
-That long?
-Aye.

453
01:08:15,324 --> 01:08:17,189
Some men are longer than others.

454
01:08:17,293 --> 01:08:20,626
Your mother been telling you stories
about me again.

455
01:08:22,198 --> 01:08:24,428
Volunteers coming in!

456
01:08:27,236 --> 01:08:28,760
William Wallace,

457
01:08:28,871 --> 01:08:31,339
we've come to fight and to die for you.

458
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:34,204
Stand up, man. I'm not the Pope.

459
01:08:34,310 --> 01:08:37,177
My name is Faudron. My sword is yours.

460
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:38,303
I brought you this.

461
01:08:38,414 --> 01:08:40,405
We checked them for arms.

462
01:08:41,484 --> 01:08:43,179
I brought you this.

463
01:08:43,652 --> 01:08:46,348
-My wife made it for you.
-Thank you.

464
01:08:51,227 --> 01:08:53,718
Him? That can't be William Wallace.

465
01:08:53,829 --> 01:08:56,024
I'm prettier than this man.

466
01:08:59,301 --> 01:09:01,667
All right, Father. I'll ask him.

467
01:09:05,641 --> 01:09:09,941
If I risk my neck for you,
will I get a chance to kill Englishmen?

468
01:09:10,045 --> 01:09:13,537
Is your father a ghost,
or do you converse with the Almighty?

469
01:09:13,649 --> 01:09:16,812
In order to find his equal,
an Irishman is forced to talk to God.

470
01:09:16,919 --> 01:09:17,908
Yes, Father?

471
01:09:18,020 --> 01:09:20,113
The Almighty says
don't change the subject,

472
01:09:20,222 --> 01:09:21,746
just answer the fucking question.

473
01:09:21,857 --> 01:09:22,824
Mind your tongue.

474
01:09:22,925 --> 01:09:24,392
Insane Irish.

475
01:09:28,597 --> 01:09:32,226
Smart enough to get a dagger
past your guards, old man.

476
01:09:33,068 --> 01:09:35,161
That's my friend, Irishman,

477
01:09:35,271 --> 01:09:37,296
and the answer to your question is yes.

478
01:09:37,406 --> 01:09:40,307
You fight for me,
you get to kill the English.

479
01:09:40,409 --> 01:09:41,967
Excellent!

480
01:09:42,077 --> 01:09:44,170
Stephen is my name.

481
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:49,479
I'm the most wanted man on my island,
except I'm not on my island, of course.

482
01:09:49,585 --> 01:09:50,984
More's the pity.

483
01:09:51,086 --> 01:09:53,281
Your island? You mean Ireland?

484
01:09:53,389 --> 01:09:54,947
Yeah. It's mine.

485
01:09:59,595 --> 01:10:01,222
You're a madman.

486
01:10:08,470 --> 01:10:10,961
I've come to the right place, then.

487
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:34,578
Sure didn't the Almighty
send me to watch your back?

488
01:11:36,158 --> 01:11:38,217
I didn't like him anyway.

489
01:11:40,429 --> 01:11:42,590
He wasn't right in the head.

490
01:11:56,078 --> 01:11:57,170
William!

491
01:11:57,279 --> 01:11:59,076
It's several runners!

492
01:12:10,059 --> 01:12:13,722
The English are advancing
an army toward Stirling.

493
01:12:13,829 --> 01:12:14,955
Do the nobles rally?

494
01:12:15,064 --> 01:12:18,431
Robert the Bruce and most of the others
will not commit to battle,

495
01:12:18,534 --> 01:12:19,865
but word has spread,

496
01:12:19,968 --> 01:12:21,799
and the Highlanders
are coming down on their own.

497
01:12:21,904 --> 01:12:25,203
Aye, in droves of hundreds
and thousands.

498
01:12:25,808 --> 01:12:27,935
Are you ready for a war?

499
01:12:43,392 --> 01:12:45,019
-Well, what news?
-We're outnumbered,

500
01:12:45,127 --> 01:12:46,287
at least three to one.

501
01:12:46,395 --> 01:12:48,863
-How many horse, then?
-Three hundred. Maybe more.

502
01:12:48,964 --> 01:12:50,329
Three hundred heavy horse?

503
01:12:50,432 --> 01:12:53,765
-We must try to negotiate.
-Well, who is in command?

504
01:12:53,869 --> 01:12:57,430
-Did he have a scarlet chevron?
-Aye, he did.

505
01:12:59,007 --> 01:13:00,907
We can still negotiate.

506
01:13:04,313 --> 01:13:06,611
What are they talking about?

507
01:13:06,715 --> 01:13:09,411
I can't hear, but it doesn't look good.

508
01:13:09,518 --> 01:13:11,452
The nobles will negotiate.

509
01:13:11,553 --> 01:13:13,953
They'll do a deal, then we go home.

510
01:13:14,990 --> 01:13:17,015
If not, we charge.

511
01:13:17,126 --> 01:13:19,959
Three hundred heavy horse,
we've no chance.

512
01:14:19,588 --> 01:14:20,987
So many.

513
01:14:25,861 --> 01:14:28,694
I didn't come here to fight
so they could own more lands.

514
01:14:28,797 --> 01:14:31,197
Then I'll have to work for them.

515
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:32,426
Nor me.

516
01:14:33,802 --> 01:14:37,863
All right, lads!
I'm not dying for these bastards.

517
01:14:37,973 --> 01:14:39,531
Let's go home!

518
01:14:57,426 --> 01:15:00,793
Stop, men! Do not flee!

519
01:15:00,896 --> 01:15:03,387
Wait until we've negotiated!

520
01:15:56,885 --> 01:15:58,079
William Wallace.

521
01:15:58,186 --> 01:16:00,211
Can't be. Not tall enough.

522
01:16:21,209 --> 01:16:23,734
The Almighty says
this must be a fashionable fight.

523
01:16:23,845 --> 01:16:25,608
It's drawn the finest people.

524
01:16:25,714 --> 01:16:27,272
Where is thy salute?

525
01:16:27,382 --> 01:16:31,148
For presenting yourselves
on this battlefield, I give you thanks.

526
01:16:31,253 --> 01:16:32,777
This is our army.

527
01:16:32,888 --> 01:16:34,412
To join it, you give homage.

528
01:16:34,523 --> 01:16:36,923
I give homage to Scotland,

529
01:16:37,626 --> 01:16:39,753
and if this is your army

530
01:16:40,929 --> 01:16:42,453
why does it go?

531
01:16:42,564 --> 01:16:45,226
We didn't come here to fight for them!

532
01:16:48,637 --> 01:16:51,105
Home! The English are too many.

533
01:17:00,148 --> 01:17:01,911
Sons of Scotland,

534
01:17:03,118 --> 01:17:04,813
I am William Wallace.

535
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:07,047
William Wallace is seven feet tall.

536
01:17:07,155 --> 01:17:09,123
Yes, I've heard.

537
01:17:09,224 --> 01:17:11,488
He kills men by the hundreds,

538
01:17:11,593 --> 01:17:14,221
and if he were here,
he'd consume the English

539
01:17:14,329 --> 01:17:18,834
with fireballs from his eyes
and bolts of lightning from his arse.

540
01:17:22,104 --> 01:17:23,935
I am William Wallace,

541
01:17:25,574 --> 01:17:29,601
and I see a whole army
of my countrymen

542
01:17:30,245 --> 01:17:32,406
here in defiance of tyranny.

543
01:17:35,851 --> 01:17:38,479
You've come to fight as free men.

544
01:17:40,489 --> 01:17:42,320
And free men you are.

545
01:17:45,494 --> 01:17:47,962
What will you do with that freedom?

546
01:17:50,132 --> 01:17:51,724
Will you fight?

547
01:17:51,833 --> 01:17:54,768
No! No! No!

548
01:17:54,870 --> 01:17:57,065
Fight? Against that? No!

549
01:17:57,506 --> 01:17:59,736
We will run, and we will live.

550
01:18:00,809 --> 01:18:02,037
Aye.

551
01:18:02,144 --> 01:18:04,169
Fight, and you may die.

552
01:18:04,279 --> 01:18:06,179
Run, and you'll live.

553
01:18:07,249 --> 01:18:08,944
At least awhile.

554
01:18:12,220 --> 01:18:15,587
And dying in your beds
many years from now,

555
01:18:16,792 --> 01:18:22,196
would you be willing to trade
all the days from this day to that

556
01:18:22,297 --> 01:18:28,099
for one chance, just one chance,
to come back here and tell our enemies

557
01:18:28,403 --> 01:18:30,633
that they may take our lives,

558
01:18:31,339 --> 01:18:34,570
but they'll never take our freedom?

559
01:19:01,903 --> 01:19:03,871
They seem quite optimistic to me.

560
01:19:03,972 --> 01:19:05,132
Maybe they do want to fight.

561
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:08,801
Confrontation might be
a foregone conclusion, milord,

562
01:19:08,910 --> 01:19:12,038
but, nonetheless, I think
we should deliver the king's terms.

563
01:19:12,147 --> 01:19:15,344
The king's terms?
He'll never live up to them.

564
01:19:15,450 --> 01:19:16,940
Milord, I think...

565
01:19:17,052 --> 01:19:19,577
All right. Offer them the terms.

566
01:19:22,724 --> 01:19:24,919
They're coming out.
Shall we go and meet them?

567
01:19:25,026 --> 01:19:27,324
-Let me do the talking. Agreed?
-Agreed.

568
01:19:33,668 --> 01:19:35,727
Fine speech.

569
01:19:35,837 --> 01:19:37,532
Now what do we do?

570
01:19:39,274 --> 01:19:41,105
Just be yourselves.

571
01:19:41,710 --> 01:19:43,337
Where are you going?

572
01:19:43,445 --> 01:19:45,470
I'm going to pick a fight.

573
01:19:52,187 --> 01:19:55,452
Well, we didn't get dressed up
for nothing.

574
01:19:58,059 --> 01:20:00,050
Mornay, Lochlan, Craig.

575
01:20:05,100 --> 01:20:07,261
Here are the king's terms.

576
01:20:07,369 --> 01:20:10,497
Lead this army off the field,

577
01:20:14,676 --> 01:20:17,736
and he will give you each
estates in Yorkshire,

578
01:20:18,747 --> 01:20:21,045
including hereditary title,

579
01:20:21,149 --> 01:20:23,640
from which you will pay...

580
01:20:23,752 --> 01:20:25,811
From which you will pay him
an annual duty...

581
01:20:25,921 --> 01:20:27,354
I have an offer for you.

582
01:20:27,455 --> 01:20:29,923
Cheltham, this is William Wallace.

583
01:20:31,660 --> 01:20:33,992
From which you will pay the king
an annual duty...

584
01:20:34,095 --> 01:20:35,426
I said I have an offer for you.

585
01:20:35,530 --> 01:20:37,157
You disrespect a banner of truce?

586
01:20:37,265 --> 01:20:39,290
From his king? Absolutely.

587
01:20:40,502 --> 01:20:42,561
Here are Scotland's terms.

588
01:20:43,071 --> 01:20:46,529
Lower your flags
and march straight back to England,

589
01:20:46,641 --> 01:20:49,235
stopping at every home you pass by
to beg forgiveness

590
01:20:49,344 --> 01:20:52,177
for 100 years of theft, rape and murder.

591
01:20:52,881 --> 01:20:55,645
Do that and your men shall live.

592
01:20:55,750 --> 01:20:58,878
Do it not
and every one of you will die today.

593
01:21:06,027 --> 01:21:07,927
You are outmatched.

594
01:21:08,029 --> 01:21:09,826
You have no heavy cavalry.

595
01:21:09,931 --> 01:21:12,263
In two centuries, no army has won...

596
01:21:12,367 --> 01:21:13,959
I'm not finished!

597
01:21:16,271 --> 01:21:18,262
Before we let you leave,

598
01:21:18,773 --> 01:21:23,642
your commander must cross that field,
present himself before this army,

599
01:21:23,745 --> 01:21:25,770
put his head between his legs,

600
01:21:25,881 --> 01:21:27,746
and kiss his own arse.

601
01:21:38,360 --> 01:21:40,885
I'd say that was rather less cordial
than he was used to.

602
01:21:40,996 --> 01:21:43,260
You be ready and do exactly as I say.

603
01:21:43,365 --> 01:21:44,389
On my signal,

604
01:21:44,499 --> 01:21:47,525
ride round behind our position
and flank them.

605
01:21:47,636 --> 01:21:49,103
We must not divide our forces.

606
01:21:49,204 --> 01:21:52,037
Do it and let the English see you do it.

607
01:21:53,308 --> 01:21:55,469
They'll think we run away.

608
01:21:55,577 --> 01:21:58,341
Take out their archers.
I'll meet you in the middle.

609
01:21:58,446 --> 01:21:59,970
Right. Come on.

610
01:22:24,506 --> 01:22:26,303
Insolent bastard.

611
01:22:26,408 --> 01:22:29,241
I want this Wallace's heart on a plate.

612
01:22:29,344 --> 01:22:30,675
Archers.

613
01:22:30,779 --> 01:22:33,407
-Archers! Archers!
-Archers!

614
01:22:39,387 --> 01:22:43,084
-Archers, forward!
-Archers, forward!

615
01:23:39,047 --> 01:23:40,537
You bastards!

616
01:24:15,250 --> 01:24:16,512
Loose!

617
01:24:36,805 --> 01:24:39,365
The Lord tells me he can get me
out of this mess,

618
01:24:39,474 --> 01:24:41,965
but he's pretty sure you're fucked.

619
01:25:03,250 --> 01:25:04,740
-Ready!
-Loose!

620
01:25:22,636 --> 01:25:24,160
Ride!

621
01:25:28,575 --> 01:25:31,339
See, every Scot with a horse is fleeing.

622
01:25:31,445 --> 01:25:34,471
Our cavalry will ride them down
like grass.

623
01:25:34,581 --> 01:25:36,048
Send the horse.

624
01:25:36,149 --> 01:25:37,810
Full attack.

625
01:26:52,259 --> 01:26:53,920
Steady!

626
01:26:55,262 --> 01:26:56,729
Hold!

627
01:26:58,732 --> 01:27:00,256
Hold!

628
01:27:04,938 --> 01:27:05,962
Hold!

629
01:27:10,811 --> 01:27:12,005
Hold!
