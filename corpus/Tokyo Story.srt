l’m leaving now

20
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:53,732
You don't need to see us off
if you're busy at school

21
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:57,277
It’s fine, I have plenty of time

- Are you sure?
- l’ll see you at the station

Bye!

27
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:42,572
Have you got the air cushion?

28
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:45,325
Didn't I give it to you?

29
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:47,995
It’s not here

30
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:52,124
- l’m sure I gave it to you
- Did you?

31
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:57,671
Good morning!

32
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:59,298
Morning

33
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:02,718
- Off to Tokyo today?
- Yes, the train's this afternoon

34
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:08,015
- I see...
- We're going to see all our children

35
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:13,353
They must be looking forward
to your visit

36
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:17,399
You'll keep an eye on the house
for us, won't you?

37
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:19,735
Of course. You enjoy yourselves

38
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:25,699
You're lucky you've got such
fine sons and daughters

39
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:28,493
Well, we'll see how we fare

40
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:33,540
- And it's a lovely day, too
- We're very lucky

41
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:37,919
- Well, I wish you both a safe trip
- Thank you

42
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:48,764
- I still can't find that air cushion
- It must be there. Have another look

43
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:55,103
- Oh, here it is
- Found it?

44
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:56,980
Got it

45
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:30,389
Doctor Hirayama
Paediatrician

46
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:40,876
Don't make the place untidy, Isamu

47
00:07:57,852 --> 00:07:59,478
l’m back!

48
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:01,313
Welcome home!

49
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:07,986
Hi. Have grandpa and grandma
arrived?

50
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:10,071
They'll be here very soon

51
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:38,225
Mum!

52
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:42,729
- What is it?
- Why have you moved my desk?

53
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:44,898
To make room
for grandpa and grandma

54
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:47,442
You don't have to move my desk,
do you?

55
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:49,945
They need the space to sleep in

56
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:53,406
Where am I supposed to study
for my exams?

57
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,825
You can study wherever you like

58
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:07,671
But Mum... where do I do my homework?

59
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:13,802
- Where, Mum?
- Just pipe down

60
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:17,138
- You never usually want to study
- Yes, I do!

61
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:19,641
You do not!

62
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:22,519
So I don't have to do
any homework, then?

63
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:26,356
- Well, that suits me just fine!
- Quiet, Minoru!

64
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:29,734
They're here

65
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:38,285
Welcome home, dear

66
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,579
Come on in

67
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:43,790
- Welcome
- Come in

68
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:52,716
Come in

69
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:58,013
There you go

70
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:12,777
You must be tired, Mother.
Did you sleep on the train?

71
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:14,779
Yes, very well

72
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:17,741
Come and sit here

73
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:25,665
Welcome to you both

74
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:29,461
It’s been a while
since we last saw you

75
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:33,965
Many thanks for having us to stay

76
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:39,888
- It’s been ages, Mother
- It has indeed

77
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:41,931
It’s lovely to see you

78
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:46,227
- Is our sister Kyoko well?
- Very well, thank you

79
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:49,064
- She's looking after the house?
- Yes

80
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:56,488
Oh, wait, Fumiko

81
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:59,824
I brought you a little something

82
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:03,536
Just some rice crackers.
They're quite tasty

83
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:06,956
- Thank you so much
- Mother's fond of them

84
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,833
Shall I serve them?

85
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:12,504
Any bowl will do

86
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:15,382
- How about this?
- Perfect, perfect

87
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:20,762
Did Noriko go to the station?

88
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:23,682
No, she didn't.
I told her when they were arriving

89
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:27,018
- I wonder what happened?
- Serve these, will you?

90
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:33,108
Minoru? Isamu?
What are you up to?

91
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:35,026
Come with me

92
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:45,286
Grandpa, grandma...

93
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:49,290
You've both grown

94
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:53,420
- Minoru's at primary school now
- I see

95
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:56,631
- And how old are you, Isamu?
- How old are you?

96
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:58,341
How old?

97
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:07,142
The bath's ready for you
whenever you like

98
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:09,894
- Would you like a bath, Father?
- All right...

99
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:12,313
- Would you like to change, Mother?
- l’ll get you a light kimono...

100
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,107
l’m fine, Fumiko

101
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,276
l’ll get in the bath

102
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:20,029
l’ll take that

103
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:21,740
This way

104
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:39,174
Did Keizo meet you at Osaka?

105
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,844
Yes, I sent him a telegram
and he met us

106
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,971
- Is he well?
- Yes

107
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:47,182
He sent a present for you

108
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:49,559
It’s all right, Mother, give it to me later

109
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:52,479
- Have you got a towel, Father?
- Yes, yes

110
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,272
Take your time

111
00:12:56,692 --> 00:13:00,236
- What shall we feed them?
- I don't know...

112
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:03,364
- Hey, brother?
- What?

113
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:06,576
Meat's all right for supper, isn't it?
Sukiyaki?

114
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:08,411
Yeah, fine

115
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:10,330
And maybe some sashimi?

116
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:14,209
The meat'll be enough

117
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:16,336
There's plenty to go round

118
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:21,007
- Hello?
- Here's Noriko. Come in!

119
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:27,180
- Welcome
- I was too late!

120
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:31,100
- Did you go to Tokyo Station?
- By the time I got there, they'd gone

121
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:33,770
- For you
- Oh, thank you

122
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:38,983
- Oh, come in
- Welcome

123
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:42,070
- Sorry l’m so late
- They're upstairs

124
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:45,532
All right, l’ll go and say hello

125
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:54,999
Welcome to you both

126
00:13:57,127 --> 00:14:00,922
- It’s been a while, Noriko
- It’s lovely to see you

127
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,968
Were you very busy?

128
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:12,475
Not really, but by the time I'd finished,
it was too late

129
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:18,857
Oh, you needn't have rushed round here.
We could've met tomorrow

130
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:22,569
Still working for the same company?

131
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:31,786
- It must be hard, supporting yourself
- Not at all

132
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:35,248
- Your bath's ready, Father!
- Coming!

133
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:51,222
- l’ll do that for you, Mother
- l’m fine

134
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:56,102
Being in Tokyo is like a dream

135
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:03,151
I always thought Tokyo
was so far away...

136
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:08,907
...but it was only yesterday we were
in Onomichi, and now we're with you

137
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:15,413
l’m glad l’m alive to see
so many changes

138
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:19,709
But the two of you
haven't changed at all

139
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:25,423
Of course we have,
we're a couple of old folks now

140
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:28,134
Mother?

141
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:33,848
What are you two talking about?
Let's go downstairs

142
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:40,355
Mother, l’m sure you're getting taller

143
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:43,942
How could I have grown?

144
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:46,986
It’s true, you have.
And you've put on weight

145
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:51,532
When I was a child,
she was so big...

146
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:55,453
...I used to feel ashamed
in front of my classmates

147
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:58,456
- Once, she broke a school chair
- Don't tell lies!

148
00:15:58,582 --> 00:16:00,667
That chair was already broken

149
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:04,212
- You still believe that?
- Of course!

150
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:06,506
Never mind. Let's go down

151
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,942
- Shall I take this through, Sister?
- Yes, do

152
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:16,576
- And this?
- Just leave it out

153
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:33,760
It’s a little cooler now

154
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:39,474
- It must be hot in Onomichi
- It is indeed

155
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,435
Mother, how is O-Ko?

156
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:48,316
She must've been born
under an unlucky star

157
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:53,780
When she was widowed,
she married again last spring...

158
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:57,408
...and took her child with her
to Kurashiki

159
00:17:58,285 --> 00:18:02,163
But I hear the poor woman's
not very happy

160
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:03,790
Really?

161
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:10,171
What was the name of that fellow
on the council staff?

162
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:14,008
Oh, Mihashi, you mean?
He passed away

163
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:18,304
- Quite some time ago, wasn't it?
- That's right

164
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:22,058
Do you remember Hattori?

165
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:24,268
In the military section?

166
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:25,978
I remember him

167
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:31,192
- He's living in Tokyo now
- Is that right?

168
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:35,404
- I intend to go round and visit him
- Where is he?

169
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:39,367
Somewhere in the Daito district.
I have his address

170
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:40,993
Right...

171
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:45,706
Have you tidied everything up?
Thanks so much

172
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:49,418
Noriko, here's your present
from Keizo

173
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:51,212
Oh, thank you

174
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:54,215
Thank you

175
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:58,928
- Oh, sorry, Grandma...
- Not at all, Fumiko, not at all

176
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:02,557
You're going out tomorrow, aren't you?

177
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:05,226
It’s Sunday,
so I can show them around

178
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:10,523
- Right. Shall we be off then, Noriko?
- Let's leave together

179
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:12,441
- Thank you
- Thank you

180
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:15,611
- Thank you for coming
- Thanks for dinner, Brother

181
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:18,114
- Sorry it's so late
- l’ll see you soon, Father

182
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,033
- Thanks
- Thanks

183
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:24,912
We'll be fine, Fumiko

184
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:40,887
- Thanks for having us so late
- Thank you for supper

185
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,471
Thank you for coming

186
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:56,319
You must be tired, Father

187
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,281
Do you want to go to bed, Mother?

188
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,618
Shall we retire, then?

189
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:08,206
- Night, then
- Goodnight

190
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:17,298
- Night
- Goodnight

191
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:21,219
- Goodnight
- Night

192
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:23,512
l’ll bring you some water

193
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:52,750
- You must be tired
- Not really

194
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:59,674
l’m glad they're all well

195
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:04,971
We're here at last

196
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:11,477
What part of Tokyo is this?

197
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:16,357
- The suburbs
- I guess so

198
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:21,320
It was a long ride from the station

199
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:27,118
I thought they'd live
somewhere more central

200
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:29,996
- Than here?
- Yes

201
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:35,209
Koichi did want to move more centrally

202
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:39,213
But it's not easy

203
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:09,118
Urara Beauty Salon

204
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,932
How long are your mother
and father staying?

205
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:34,643
Four or five days. Pass me that

206
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:41,901
- Shouldn't I call round to see them?
- Don't bother. They'll come here

207
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:47,865
I should take them to a show
or something

208
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:51,327
You needn't bother
worrying about them

209
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:57,958
They're delicious, these beans

210
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:03,589
What are their plans for today?

211
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:08,427
Don't eat all those beans

212
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:12,640
My brother's taking them sightseeing

213
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:16,310
So I needn't bother, then

214
00:23:16,436 --> 00:23:19,021
Kiyo, come and get some food

215
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:26,487
Behave yourselves today
when you're with grandpa and grandma

216
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:28,906
- You hear me?
- Yes

217
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:30,533
Sit down

218
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:34,161
- How much longer?
- They'll be ready soon

219
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:37,790
Go upstairs and
ask if they're ready to go

220
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:49,260
- Are you ready?
- Ready

221
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:52,721
- Sorry to keep you waiting
- Let's go, then

222
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:00,771
They're coming

223
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:07,236
What about lunch?

224
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:11,115
We'll go to a restaurant
in a department store

225
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:13,701
- The children will like that
- Fine

226
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:17,788
- Isamu loves those kiddy lunches
- All right

227
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:33,345
Excuse me...

228
00:24:35,056 --> 00:24:38,767
- How is he?
- No better

229
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:46,108
- Any appetite?
- He'll only take a cold drink

230
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:51,322
- Has his temperature fallen?
- His temperature is still 102

231
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:53,449
I see. I'd better see him

232
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:56,869
Thank you, l’m sorry to spoil your day

233
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:09,882
Are the hypodermics sterilised?
I must visit a patient

234
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:11,467
Really?

235
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:20,142
Father, l’m afraid
I have to visit a patient

236
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:21,727
- I see
- Sorry

237
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:26,941
- Never mind
- It could take a while

238
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:29,026
That's all right

239
00:25:29,152 --> 00:25:32,863
- l’ll see you later
- Take care

240
00:25:34,741 --> 00:25:37,576
- Still not ready?
- No...

241
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:49,129
- I may be late
- What about your mother and father?

242
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:51,715
Shall I take them?

243
00:25:51,841 --> 00:25:57,388
You can't leave the house unoccupied.
We'll go next Sunday

244
00:25:57,514 --> 00:26:00,474
Very well. See you later

245
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:10,276
- Where's dad going?
- To see a patient

246
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:18,826
l’m awfully sorry

247
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:21,787
Never mind.
A busy doctor's a good doctor

248
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:24,373
He's very dedicated

249
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:28,210
Aren't we going, Mum? It’s not fair!

250
00:26:28,336 --> 00:26:31,171
It can't be helped. A patient needs him

251
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:33,340
Not fair!

252
00:26:33,466 --> 00:26:36,510
- You can go another time
- Not fair!

253
00:26:36,636 --> 00:26:38,679
Behave yourself, Minoru!

254
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:41,807
- You lied!
- Make yourself scarce!

255
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:47,479
- Come here
- No way!

256
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:53,193
- They're so naughty
- It’s good for boys to be spirited

257
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:07,041
Now just behave yourselves

258
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:08,834
It’s not fair!

259
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:12,504
You can go another time

260
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:16,216
It’s always "another time".
We never go!

261
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:18,719
It can't be helped
that dad had to go out

262
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:23,599
- As usual!
- Now don't be so difficult

263
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:26,018
- It’s not fair!
- Not fair!

264
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:30,397
- Not fair!
- What? You're being horrible

265
00:27:30,523 --> 00:27:33,651
- Behave, or l’ll tell your father
- Go and tell him!

266
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:39,198
- You just remember those words!
- See if I care!

267
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:44,662
- What's the matter?
- Oh, nothing...

268
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:48,832
Come along, Isamu,
come for a walk with granny

269
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:51,627
- Won't you come, too, Minoru?
- Minoru...

270
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:56,632
- Come on, then
- That'll be nice with granny, Isamu

271
00:27:56,758 --> 00:27:58,884
Let's go

272
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:02,388
Sure you don't want to come, Minoru?

273
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:06,892
Thank you

274
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:11,397
Minoru, go with them

275
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:14,233
- Shan't!
- Suit yourself then

276
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:21,615
See you later

277
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:52,312
Here you are

278
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:56,734
Thank you

279
00:28:58,778 --> 00:29:03,449
- What's up with Minoru?
- He's just so stubborn

280
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:06,201
His father was the same

281
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:11,123
Koichi always had to have his own way

282
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:14,418
It’s just a shame he had to go out
when you're here

283
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:16,920
Oh, we're fine

284
00:29:17,046 --> 00:29:19,548
We'll go next Sunday

285
00:29:19,674 --> 00:29:21,592
Thank you

286
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:26,972
After a few days here,
we're thinking of visiting Shige

287
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:36,064
There they are

288
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:05,886
What do you want to be
when you grow up, Isamu?

289
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:16,021
Do you want to be a doctor
like your daddy?

290
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:22,361
By the time you're a doctor,
I wonder where l’ll be?

291
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:22,296
Welcome back

292
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:25,424
Hello

293
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:28,635
- There was a call for you
- Who from?

294
00:31:28,761 --> 00:31:33,098
- Enomoto phoned about that business
- That's all wrapped up

295
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:40,814
- What are your folks up to?
- They're upstairs

296
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:45,110
I bought some sweets for them
from a place in Asakusa

297
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:51,450
Try one, they're delicious

298
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:56,788
These are expensive.
They don't expect such things

299
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:05,130
Tasty, eh?

300
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:08,342
Yes, but such things
are wasted on them

301
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:10,427
Rice crackers would've done

302
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:12,763
But they had rice crackers yesterday

303
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:15,724
Yes, but they really like them

304
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:23,023
Will you take them out somewhere
tomorrow?

305
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:26,735
Tomorrow? l’m afraid I can't

306
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:29,988
- I have to collect some accounts
- Really?

307
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:35,160
I was hoping my brother
would do something with them

308
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:39,164
- How about taking them to a film?
- What's on?

309
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:43,877
- There's plenty on in the evenings
- Do that with them, then

310
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:46,046
They've seen nothing of Tokyo yet

311
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:48,757
It'd be a shame for them
not to get out

312
00:32:48,883 --> 00:32:52,886
I know, but who has the time
to take them?

313
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:44,062
- You look busy
- Oh, you're back

314
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:46,982
- Here
- Oh, thank you

315
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:53,447
- What a job you've been asked to do!
- Not at all

316
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:56,116
- Where's father?
- Putting clothes out to dry

317
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:58,910
I see. Let's go to the bathhouse

318
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:08,587
Father? Father!

319
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:15,427
Let's go to the bathhouse

320
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:34,863
Welcome home

321
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:37,157
Let's go to the bathhouse

322
00:34:37,283 --> 00:34:41,787
- And we can buy ice-cream afterwards
- Oh, thank you

323
00:34:44,665 --> 00:34:46,625
Right, let's go

324
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:07,145
- We're off to the bathhouse
- All right

325
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:11,191
- See you later
- Bye

326
00:35:11,317 --> 00:35:12,859
See you later

327
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:15,862
Mother, you can use my old sandals

328
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:19,116
Really? Thanks

329
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:32,003
Here

330
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:47,644
Hello? Is that Yoneyama & Co?

331
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:51,106
May I speak to Noriko Hirayama?
Thank you

332
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,197
Ah, Noriko? It’s me

333
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:01,116
Don't mention it

334
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:05,120
Listen, I need a favour

335
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:08,790
Can you spare any time tomorrow?

336
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:13,753
Father and mother haven't
been sightseeing yet in Tokyo

337
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:19,384
I was wondering if you could
take them out somewhere tomorrow

338
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:26,808
I know. I ought to take them really,
but l’m too busy at the shop

339
00:36:26,934 --> 00:36:29,936
I know, l’m sorry

340
00:36:30,062 --> 00:36:31,897
Eh? Really?

341
00:36:33,065 --> 00:36:35,400
- Thank you
- Not at all

342
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:39,404
Wait a moment, l’ll have to see

343
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:49,247
- l’m sorry it's such short notice...
- What is it?

344
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:51,958
- May I have tomorrow off?
- All right

345
00:36:52,084 --> 00:36:54,294
- Thank you
- What about the aluminium contract?

346
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,421
l’ll get it finished today

347
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:03,470
Hello? Sorry to keep you waiting

348
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:06,473
l’ll call for them at 9:00
tomorrow morning

349
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:07,933
Not at all

350
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:11,269
Give my best regards
to your mother and father

351
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:13,230
Till tomorrow, then

352
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:23,657
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Tokyo

353
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:30,121
Let's trace the illustrious history
of this great city

354
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:36,294
On your right, the Imperial Palace,
formerly Chiyoda Castle

355
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:41,508
Built 500 years ago
by Lord Dokan Ota...

356
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:46,137
...its tranquil setting amid
green pine trees and a large moat...

357
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:50,892
...contrasts strongly
with the bustle of modern Tokyo

358
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:50,869
- Koichi's house is in that direction
- I see...

359
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:57,667
- And Shige's house?
- Her house is that way, I think

360
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:03,298
- And yours?
- My house is in that direction

361
00:39:09,972 --> 00:39:12,766
- It’s over that way
- I see

362
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:17,562
I hope you'll come home with me later

363
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:49,052
Who is it?

364
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:52,263
- Only me
- You're home early today

365
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:55,475
- Is Miko sleeping?
- She's just settled down

366
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:59,187
- You don't have any sake, do you?
- Sake?

367
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:04,567
- My in-laws are here
- I think I might have some

368
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:12,742
- This is all l’ve got. Is this enough?
- Fine. Thanks

369
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:27,132
Where did he have this photo taken?

370
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:30,885
In Kamakura. A friend took it

371
00:40:31,011 --> 00:40:33,012
- I see
- When was that?

372
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:36,766
- The year before he was conscripted
- Really...

373
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:40,562
That's his typical look

374
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:43,481
Head on one side

375
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:46,151
He always stood like that

376
00:40:56,662 --> 00:40:59,038
- What is it?
- May I borrow a flask?

377
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:00,832
Oh, right

378
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:10,758
There you go. Do you want these, too?
They're delicious

379
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:12,969
Thank you

380
00:41:13,095 --> 00:41:14,888
Sorry to bother you

381
00:41:25,858 --> 00:41:29,569
Noriko, please don't go to any trouble

382
00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:32,363
It’s fine, it's no trouble

383
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:38,328
Thank you so much for today

384
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:42,874
Not at all.
You both must be exhausted

385
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:47,504
No, we've seen so many places,
thanks to you

386
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:04,562
l’m sorry you had to put up with us
all day

387
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:07,106
Of course not

388
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:11,528
- You must be busy at work, though
- Not really

389
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:16,574
We're only a small company and
not that busy, so I can take time off

390
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:19,077
Well, that's lucky for us

391
00:42:33,425 --> 00:42:34,926
Please...

392
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:37,637
All right...

393
00:42:39,473 --> 00:42:42,350
And on an empty stomach, too...

394
00:42:48,315 --> 00:42:50,984
This is good stuff

395
00:42:51,777 --> 00:42:54,153
Do you like a drop of sake, Father?

396
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:57,824
Oh, yes,
very much so in the old days

397
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:01,953
If we ever ran out at home...

398
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:04,998
...he'd rush out for more,
any time of the night

399
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:09,168
Every time we had a son...

400
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:13,798
...I'd pray he wouldn't
become a drinker

401
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:16,759
Did Shoji drink?

402
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:22,724
- He did indeed
- Is that so?

403
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:26,644
Often, when he went out drinking
after work...

404
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:31,024
...he'd bring friends home because
they'd missed their last trains

405
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:36,279
- Really?
- So you had the sort of trouble I had

406
00:43:36,405 --> 00:43:42,619
Yes... but now
it's a very dear memory

407
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:44,454
How true

408
00:43:45,414 --> 00:43:47,707
Poor Shoji,
he lived so far away...

409
00:43:47,833 --> 00:43:50,793
...I feel he's still alive somewhere

410
00:43:51,837 --> 00:43:55,798
Father often tells me
not to be so foolish

411
00:43:55,924 --> 00:44:01,012
He must be dead. It’s been
eight years since the end of the war

412
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:03,181
I know, but all the same...

413
00:44:04,391 --> 00:44:07,894
He was so wilful as a boy

414
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:10,355
l’m sure he gave you
plenty of trouble, too

415
00:44:11,398 --> 00:44:12,857
Not really...

416
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:18,863
Then he had to die. Poor Noriko

417
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:23,618
Yes?

418
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:30,375
- Sorry to keep you waiting
- Thank you

419
00:44:33,629 --> 00:44:35,463
It’s not much, but...

420
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:42,178
- There you are, Mother
- Thanks

421
00:44:42,304 --> 00:44:47,809
- Help yourself
- Very well. Thank you so much

422
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:27,724
- They're late
- They'll be back soon

423
00:45:33,105 --> 00:45:36,107
How long are they planning
to stay in Tokyo?

424
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:43,030
- They said nothing to you?
- No...

425
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:48,244
Listen, Brother...

426
00:45:49,913 --> 00:45:54,333
...I was thinking, are you willing
to put up 3,000 yen?

427
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:57,837
- What for?
- I will if you will

428
00:45:57,963 --> 00:46:00,047
2,000 yen should suffice

429
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:03,676
- No, we'll need 3,000 yen
- What for?

430
00:46:03,802 --> 00:46:07,972
I was thinking we could send them
to a hot springs

431
00:46:09,349 --> 00:46:14,145
You and I are too busy
to shepherd them around

432
00:46:15,314 --> 00:46:18,149
And we can't keep asking Noriko

433
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:21,861
- What do you think?
- Not a bad idea...

434
00:46:21,987 --> 00:46:26,908
I know a nice hotel in Atami,
not expensive at all

435
00:46:28,702 --> 00:46:34,499
- Sounds good. Let's send them there
- l’m sure they'll be pleased

436
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:36,292
Good...

437
00:46:37,294 --> 00:46:42,882
I was worrying about the cost of taking
them around. But 3,000 yen's fine

438
00:46:43,008 --> 00:46:48,179
Of course, sending them to Atami
will be much cheaper for us

439
00:46:50,182 --> 00:46:52,016
Dear?

440
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:55,728
What is it?

441
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:05,905
We're making plans
to send the old folks to Atami spa

442
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:07,907
That's a great idea

443
00:47:08,033 --> 00:47:12,328
I wish I could show them around,
but l’m just so busy

444
00:47:12,454 --> 00:47:17,333
- So you agree?
- Absolutely. It’s a great idea

445
00:47:17,459 --> 00:47:19,877
Let's do it, then

446
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:24,298
- We can do nothing for them here
- Yeah, you're right

447
00:47:24,424 --> 00:47:26,092
Atami is a good idea

448
00:47:26,218 --> 00:47:28,678
Rather than tramping around Tokyo...

449
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:31,681
...they can bathe in the hot springs
and relax

450
00:47:31,807 --> 00:47:35,393
- The old folks will love it, won't they?
- You're right

451
00:47:38,438 --> 00:47:40,356
They are late, though

452
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:44,902
- Perhaps they're at Noriko's place
- Oh, maybe

453
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:30,114
l’ve never been to a hot springs before

454
00:48:31,283 --> 00:48:34,285
We've put them to additional expense

455
00:48:35,454 --> 00:48:37,872
Isn't this nice, though?

456
00:48:39,458 --> 00:48:43,586
Let's get up early tomorrow
and take a walk along the beach

457
00:48:43,712 --> 00:48:45,546
Let's do that

458
00:48:45,672 --> 00:48:50,635
The scenery around here
is supposed to be lovely

459
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:54,555
- That's what the maid told me
- Really?

460
00:48:57,893 --> 00:49:00,102
The sea is so calm

461
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:54,573
- Sorry to keep you waiting
- The noodles have arrived

462
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:57,743
- What's the bet?
- You had that?

463
00:49:57,869 --> 00:50:00,871
- That hurts me
- Not bad, not bad

464
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:06,961
- There you are
- l’ll take, l’ll take

465
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:11,590
- Ready!
- Ready?

466
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:14,427
- You discarded this?
- Yeah, I did

467
00:50:14,553 --> 00:50:16,262
l’m out

468
00:50:16,388 --> 00:50:18,723
How do you like that, you idiot?

469
00:50:22,394 --> 00:50:24,645
That makes 1632

470
00:50:24,771 --> 00:50:26,397
He thrashed us!

471
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:03,642
It’s so noisy

472
00:51:12,652 --> 00:51:15,362
I wonder how late it is

473
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:29,794
Evening!

474
00:53:29,497 --> 00:53:32,166
What's the matter?

475
00:53:32,292 --> 00:53:34,919
You didn't sleep well last night,
did you?

476
00:53:37,422 --> 00:53:39,423
But you slept well

477
00:53:39,549 --> 00:53:42,801
No, I didn't sleep a wink

478
00:53:42,928 --> 00:53:45,971
You say that,
but you were sound asleep

479
00:53:46,097 --> 00:53:47,806
Really?

480
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:51,852
This place is for the younger generation

481
00:53:51,978 --> 00:53:53,604
You're right

482
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:09,286
Hey, what about those newlyweds?
They made so much noise!

483
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:11,914
Do you think they're really
honeymooners?

484
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:16,126
He was up this morning,
but she was lolling in bed

485
00:54:16,253 --> 00:54:17,544
He's a fool

486
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:24,176
I heard him tell her, "You're all mine!
Ears, eyes, mouth, all mine!"

487
00:54:24,302 --> 00:54:26,971
A woman like her!

488
00:54:37,148 --> 00:54:39,900
I wonder how Kyoko's getting on
by herself

489
00:54:42,988 --> 00:54:44,780
Shall we head home?

490
00:54:46,658 --> 00:54:49,910
Are you feeling homesick already?

491
00:54:50,036 --> 00:54:54,123
You're the one that's homesick,
aren't you?

492
00:54:56,626 --> 00:55:00,379
We've seen Tokyo,
we've seen Atami

493
00:55:01,506 --> 00:55:06,802
- Shall we go home?
- Very well, let's go home

494
00:55:20,817 --> 00:55:22,526
What's the matter?

495
00:55:25,697 --> 00:55:30,409
I just felt slightly dizzy.
l’m fine now

496
00:55:30,535 --> 00:55:33,912
You didn't sleep very well, that's why.
Let's go

497
00:56:05,737 --> 00:56:10,616
How about sweeping it back?
That would suit you

498
00:56:10,742 --> 00:56:12,284
You think so?

499
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:15,079
You have a lovely neckline

500
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:19,291
Keep the left side flat
and put a wave in the right side

501
00:56:19,417 --> 00:56:23,253
- l’ll try it next time
- It will enhance your personality

502
00:56:24,714 --> 00:56:27,925
Kiyo, pass me another magazine.
And some matches

503
00:56:42,273 --> 00:56:45,234
- Welcome
- We're back

504
00:56:46,486 --> 00:56:49,947
What? Back so soon?

505
00:56:53,201 --> 00:56:57,079
- Afternoon
- Why didn't you stay longer?

506
00:56:57,205 --> 00:57:01,291
- What happened?
- Well...

507
00:57:05,922 --> 00:57:07,548
Afternoon

508
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:22,771
- Who's that?
- Just some friends from the country

509
00:57:25,942 --> 00:57:28,652
Kiyo, take over this for me

510
00:57:40,623 --> 00:57:43,000
What happened?
You're back so soon

511
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:48,046
- How was Atami?
- Yes, we liked the hot baths

512
00:57:48,173 --> 00:57:51,884
And our room had a lovely view

513
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:57,556
I know. That hotel's only just
been built. Was it crowded?

514
00:57:57,682 --> 00:58:00,893
Hmm... a little crowded

515
00:58:01,019 --> 00:58:05,272
- And what about the food?
- Sashimi, savoury egg custard...

516
00:58:05,398 --> 00:58:08,734
Their sashimi is tasty.
It’s on the coast, that's why

517
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:11,904
And they served huge omelettes, too

518
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:16,200
How come you came back?
We wanted you to relax

519
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:18,869
We thought you'd have
two or three days' rest

520
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:23,248
We thought it was time
we got back home

521
00:58:23,374 --> 00:58:27,461
So soon?
You're not that often in Tokyo

522
00:58:27,587 --> 00:58:30,506
Still, we'd better be going

523
00:58:30,632 --> 00:58:33,550
Kyoko must be feeling lonely at home

524
00:58:33,676 --> 00:58:37,763
She'll be fine, Mother.
She's not a baby anymore

525
00:58:37,889 --> 00:58:40,807
Next time, I plan to take you
to the Kabuki theatre

526
00:58:40,934 --> 00:58:46,146
I don't want to put you
to so much expense

527
00:58:47,148 --> 00:58:49,566
I just want you to relax

528
00:58:49,692 --> 00:58:54,905
Still, my colleagues are holding
a meeting here tonight from 7:00

529
00:58:55,031 --> 00:58:58,200
Oh? Will there be many of them?

530
00:58:58,326 --> 00:59:01,703
Yes. It’s my turn to be host

531
00:59:01,829 --> 00:59:04,957
We've come back
at the wrong moment

532
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:10,462
I should have told you. That's why
I wanted you to stay at Atami

533
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:16,426
- The dye's ready
- All right. Excuse me

534
00:59:31,776 --> 00:59:33,402
What shall we do?

535
00:59:35,446 --> 00:59:37,072
I don't know

536
00:59:38,366 --> 00:59:42,869
We can't go to Koichi's
and bother them again

537
00:59:42,996 --> 00:59:48,792
You're right.
Shall we get Noriko to put us up?

538
00:59:48,918 --> 00:59:54,006
She hasn't got room for both of us.
You go there

539
00:59:55,091 --> 00:59:56,800
What about you?

540
00:59:57,677 --> 01:00:03,098
l’ll visit the Hattori family
and stay there if I can

541
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:06,518
Anyway, let's get going

542
01:00:15,945 --> 01:00:19,114
Well, we've become homeless at last

543
01:01:09,874 --> 01:01:15,045
- Noriko ought to be home by now
- You think so?

544
01:01:15,171 --> 01:01:17,339
Perhaps it's still a bit early

545
01:01:17,465 --> 01:01:23,053
If you're going to the Hattori family,
you'd better start now

546
01:01:23,179 --> 01:01:26,473
Yes, we'd better go

547
01:01:49,288 --> 01:01:51,331
That's just like you

548
01:02:14,272 --> 01:02:18,233
Isn't Tokyo vast?

549
01:02:18,359 --> 01:02:20,485
Isn't it just?

550
01:02:20,611 --> 01:02:26,324
If we were to get lost,
we might find never each other again

551
01:02:46,637 --> 01:02:49,765
Hattori - Professional Scribe

552
01:02:54,479 --> 01:02:57,063
Is that how long it's been?

553
01:02:57,190 --> 01:03:00,650
It must be 17 or 18 years

554
01:03:00,777 --> 01:03:02,235
Really?

555
01:03:02,361 --> 01:03:05,238
Still, you've sent me a card
every New Year's

556
01:03:05,364 --> 01:03:07,199
Don't mention it

557
01:03:07,325 --> 01:03:10,827
I suppose Onomichi
has changed a lot

558
01:03:10,953 --> 01:03:15,415
Well, fortunately, it wasn't bombed

559
01:03:15,541 --> 01:03:19,878
The area you used to live in
hasn't changed at all

560
01:03:20,004 --> 01:03:23,590
Is that right?
It was such a nice place

561
01:03:24,592 --> 01:03:28,470
We used to enjoy the view
from the Senko temple

562
01:03:28,596 --> 01:03:32,808
The price of sea bream used to drop
after the cherry blossom season

563
01:03:32,934 --> 01:03:35,185
We haven't eaten it
since we moved to Tokyo

564
01:03:35,311 --> 01:03:37,187
That's so true

565
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:41,191
Listen, dear...

566
01:03:42,693 --> 01:03:44,611
Hmm, later

567
01:03:48,366 --> 01:03:52,202
Tell my friends
l’ll be playing pin-ball round there

568
01:03:52,328 --> 01:03:54,371
- See you later
- Thank you

569
01:03:55,998 --> 01:04:00,627
We rent the upstairs room to him.
He likes going out at night

570
01:04:01,963 --> 01:04:06,091
He's a law student,
but he never does any studying

571
01:04:06,217 --> 01:04:08,051
Really?

572
01:04:08,177 --> 01:04:13,431
He's always gambling at pin-ball
and mah-jong. I feel sorry for his father

573
01:04:15,226 --> 01:04:17,435
Go on, dear...

574
01:04:17,562 --> 01:04:20,647
How's about going for a drink
for old times' sake?

575
01:04:21,691 --> 01:04:24,943
l’m sure my cooking isn't
good enough for you

576
01:04:25,069 --> 01:04:27,445
Forgive me for turning up
out of the blue

577
01:04:27,572 --> 01:04:32,242
- Remember our old police chief?
- Numata?

578
01:04:32,368 --> 01:04:37,539
- He lives nearby
- Does he? How is he?

579
01:04:37,665 --> 01:04:42,085
He's fine. His son's an executive
in a printing company

580
01:04:42,211 --> 01:04:45,964
- Well, good for him
- Shall we pay him a visit?

581
01:04:46,090 --> 01:04:49,509
That would be wonderful

582
01:04:51,804 --> 01:04:53,722
Fancy that?

583
01:05:09,322 --> 01:05:12,157
- Drink up
- l’ve had plenty

584
01:05:12,283 --> 01:05:15,535
Drink up, for old times' sake!

585
01:05:18,706 --> 01:05:21,583
I haven't touched a drink in years

586
01:05:21,709 --> 01:05:25,378
Remember how you drank
when the Governor visited us?

587
01:05:25,504 --> 01:05:27,297
You mean at the Takemura?

588
01:05:28,925 --> 01:05:30,967
You got absolutely legless!

589
01:05:31,093 --> 01:05:33,762
Remember that young geisha
who served us?

590
01:05:33,888 --> 01:05:36,723
- Umeko?
- You really took a fancy to her

591
01:05:38,643 --> 01:05:43,229
So did the Governor,
if you remember?

592
01:05:43,856 --> 01:05:45,732
And you, as well

593
01:05:45,858 --> 01:05:51,613
Ah, youth! I always disgraced myself
whenever I got drunk

594
01:05:51,739 --> 01:05:56,117
Not at all!
Drink is good for your health

595
01:05:59,705 --> 01:06:04,000
You're lucky, your children
are all well settled

596
01:06:04,126 --> 01:06:06,378
l’m not so sure about that

597
01:06:06,504 --> 01:06:11,341
I often wish at least
one of my sons were alive

598
01:06:11,467 --> 01:06:13,927
Both were killed in the war

599
01:06:15,179 --> 01:06:16,888
Didn't you lose one?

600
01:06:18,474 --> 01:06:20,600
Yes, my second son

601
01:06:20,726 --> 01:06:23,728
l’ve had enough of war

602
01:06:26,774 --> 01:06:30,902
It’s hard to lose one's children

603
01:06:31,028 --> 01:06:36,700
However, living with them
isn't always easy, either

604
01:06:37,743 --> 01:06:39,911
A real dilemma

605
01:06:42,498 --> 01:06:44,124
Let's drink

606
01:06:45,793 --> 01:06:48,336
Let's change the subject

607
01:06:50,297 --> 01:06:52,424
- And cheer up!
- Yes!

608
01:06:53,134 --> 01:06:57,637
If I had an extra bedroom for you,
we could drink till morning

609
01:07:02,393 --> 01:07:05,061
Miss, more sake!

610
01:07:06,230 --> 01:07:08,815
Come on, Miss,
bring us some sake...

611
01:07:14,196 --> 01:07:17,532
Anyway, l’m really glad you came

612
01:07:17,658 --> 01:07:21,411
I never dreamed
I'd see you here in Tokyo

613
01:07:34,091 --> 01:07:36,843
Okaya Noodles

614
01:07:56,447 --> 01:07:58,281
Here's some warm sake

615
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:01,868
Pour one for me, would you?

616
01:08:01,994 --> 01:08:03,953
You're so drunk

617
01:08:06,165 --> 01:08:10,585
Hirayama, she looks like
someone, don't you think?

618
01:08:10,711 --> 01:08:13,963
- Here we go again!
- Don't you think so?

619
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:16,132
Well, like who?

620
01:08:17,718 --> 01:08:19,886
- Yes, she does
- Like who?

621
01:08:20,012 --> 01:08:25,183
- That geisha Umeko?
- Oh, no! She was much fatter

622
01:08:25,309 --> 01:08:28,770
- She looks like my wife
- You're right

623
01:08:28,896 --> 01:08:31,064
See, especially here...

624
01:08:31,190 --> 01:08:34,400
Isn't it time you went home?
You've had enough

625
01:08:34,527 --> 01:08:37,487
- And both of them are bad-tempered!
- You're being a nuisance

626
01:08:37,613 --> 01:08:39,948
That's what my wife says, too

627
01:08:41,075 --> 01:08:44,619
Hey, come here and pour for me

628
01:08:46,413 --> 01:08:48,039
Have some more

629
01:08:48,999 --> 01:08:50,625
No, thanks

630
01:08:54,213 --> 01:08:58,633
I think you're the luckiest one of all

631
01:08:58,759 --> 01:09:00,677
How come?

632
01:09:00,803 --> 01:09:05,014
With good sons and daughters
to be proud of

633
01:09:05,141 --> 01:09:07,308
You can be proud of yours, too

634
01:09:07,434 --> 01:09:10,436
No, my son's no good

635
01:09:10,563 --> 01:09:14,524
He's henpecked
and treats me like l’m in the way

636
01:09:14,650 --> 01:09:16,568
He's nothing!

637
01:09:18,404 --> 01:09:22,198
But being head of department
is a good position

638
01:09:22,324 --> 01:09:24,993
Head of nothing, more like!

639
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:27,620
He's only an assistant section chief

640
01:09:27,746 --> 01:09:34,294
I get so depressed that I lie to people
about his position

641
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:36,171
He's a failure

642
01:09:37,965 --> 01:09:39,549
I don't think so

643
01:09:40,467 --> 01:09:45,013
He's my only son,
so I spared the rod and spoiled him

644
01:09:46,807 --> 01:09:50,935
You brought your son up properly

645
01:09:51,061 --> 01:09:53,646
He has a degree and everything!

646
01:09:53,772 --> 01:09:57,066
All doctors have to have degrees

647
01:09:58,861 --> 01:10:02,655
l’m afraid we expect
too much of our children

648
01:10:04,116 --> 01:10:06,534
They lack spirit

649
01:10:06,660 --> 01:10:09,871
And they lack ambition

650
01:10:09,997 --> 01:10:13,041
l’ve told my son that

651
01:10:13,167 --> 01:10:16,669
He said that there are
too many people in Tokyo...

652
01:10:16,795 --> 01:10:19,255
...that it's hard to get ahead

653
01:10:19,381 --> 01:10:23,259
What do you think?
Young people today have no backbone

654
01:10:23,385 --> 01:10:26,387
Where is their spirit?

655
01:10:27,306 --> 01:10:29,265
That's not how I raised him!

656
01:10:30,309 --> 01:10:33,102
But Numata...

657
01:10:34,897 --> 01:10:37,190
You don't agree with me?

658
01:10:37,316 --> 01:10:42,237
- You're satisfied?
- Of course not, but...

659
01:10:42,363 --> 01:10:46,324
You see?
Even you aren't satisfied

660
01:10:52,665 --> 01:10:54,832
It makes me feel so sad

661
01:10:55,709 --> 01:10:58,753
No more to drink

662
01:11:05,844 --> 01:11:10,556
However, Numata,
until I came up to Tokyo...

663
01:11:10,683 --> 01:11:14,310
...I was under the impression
that my son was doing better

664
01:11:15,562 --> 01:11:20,400
But l’ve found that he's only
a small neighbourhood doctor

665
01:11:20,526 --> 01:11:23,152
I know how you feel

666
01:11:23,279 --> 01:11:26,572
l’m as dissatisfied as you are

667
01:11:26,699 --> 01:11:32,745
But we can't expect too much
from our children, Numata

668
01:11:32,871 --> 01:11:36,958
Times have changed.
We have to face it

669
01:11:37,084 --> 01:11:40,837
- That's what I think
- Is it?

670
01:11:40,963 --> 01:11:46,134
- Yes
- I see. You, too

671
01:11:46,969 --> 01:11:51,889
My son has really changed,
but there's nothing I can do about it

672
01:11:53,684 --> 01:11:58,438
After all, there are
too many people in Tokyo

673
01:11:58,564 --> 01:12:00,815
You think so?

674
01:12:00,941 --> 01:12:03,776
I suppose I should be happy

675
01:12:05,696 --> 01:12:07,947
Maybe you're right

676
01:12:08,991 --> 01:12:14,787
Nowadays, some young men
kill their parents without a thought

677
01:12:14,913 --> 01:12:18,499
At least mine wouldn't do that

678
01:12:22,629 --> 01:12:25,131
Look, it's gone midnight

679
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:28,301
So what?

680
01:12:29,136 --> 01:12:31,012
It’s time you went home

681
01:12:33,515 --> 01:12:37,602
You get more and more like my wife.
I like you, you know?

682
01:12:37,728 --> 01:12:40,730
Do something with him, will you?

683
01:12:40,856 --> 01:12:43,399
Leave him alone

684
01:12:43,525 --> 01:12:47,528
Let's drink up tonight, right?

685
01:12:47,654 --> 01:12:49,655
A wonderful night, eh?

686
01:12:51,033 --> 01:12:53,242
Wonderful, wonderful

687
01:12:53,369 --> 01:12:55,536
Wonderful night

688
01:13:29,196 --> 01:13:32,031
Thank you. That's enough for me

689
01:13:35,035 --> 01:13:37,537
It’s been a long day today

690
01:13:38,455 --> 01:13:40,873
First we get back from Atami...

691
01:13:40,999 --> 01:13:43,042
...then to Shige's house...

692
01:13:44,378 --> 01:13:46,712
...then over to Ueno Park

693
01:13:46,839 --> 01:13:48,798
You must be tired

694
01:13:48,924 --> 01:13:50,633
Not so much

695
01:13:51,510 --> 01:13:54,679
And here I am, troubling you

696
01:13:54,805 --> 01:13:57,723
- l’m so sorry
- Not at all

697
01:13:58,809 --> 01:14:03,855
But I really appreciate your coming.
l’m so happy

698
01:14:04,815 --> 01:14:06,941
l’m a burden to everyone

699
01:14:07,901 --> 01:14:11,028
- You've done more than enough
- Really?

700
01:14:12,281 --> 01:14:14,323
Thank you so much

701
01:14:23,625 --> 01:14:28,296
You must go to bed now.
You have your work tomorrow morning

702
01:14:28,422 --> 01:14:32,550
You need to go to bed, too.
Let's both get some sleep

703
01:14:32,676 --> 01:14:38,055
- Very well. I think I will
- Please do

704
01:14:48,692 --> 01:14:54,113
What a treat,
to sleep in Shoji's bed

705
01:15:02,331 --> 01:15:04,123
Noriko...

706
01:15:05,459 --> 01:15:09,629
- Forgive me if l’m being rude...
- What is it?

707
01:15:09,755 --> 01:15:14,217
Well, it's been eight years
since my son's death...

708
01:15:14,343 --> 01:15:19,388
...yet you still keep
his photo up there like that

709
01:15:20,224 --> 01:15:23,559
I feel sorry for you

710
01:15:24,394 --> 01:15:25,895
Why?

711
01:15:26,021 --> 01:15:29,565
Because you're young and...

712
01:15:31,151 --> 01:15:33,027
l’m not that young anymore

713
01:15:33,153 --> 01:15:35,571
Yes, you are

714
01:15:35,697 --> 01:15:39,116
I feel we're doing you wrong

715
01:15:39,243 --> 01:15:42,161
l’ve often talked to Father about this

716
01:15:43,163 --> 01:15:46,082
If you ever meet someone else...

717
01:15:46,208 --> 01:15:49,544
...you must feel free
to get remarried any time

718
01:15:50,921 --> 01:15:52,630
I mean it

719
01:15:52,756 --> 01:15:57,718
It pains us to think
that you won't remarry

720
01:15:58,428 --> 01:16:00,638
All right, if I meet the right man...

721
01:16:00,764 --> 01:16:03,307
You certainly will

722
01:16:03,433 --> 01:16:05,726
Why wouldn't you?

723
01:16:06,353 --> 01:16:07,812
You think so?

724
01:16:07,938 --> 01:16:12,733
You had more hard times
than happiness after marrying him

725
01:16:12,859 --> 01:16:17,113
I know we should have done
something for you

726
01:16:17,239 --> 01:16:21,075
Please, Mother.
l’m quite happy as I am

727
01:16:21,201 --> 01:16:25,871
But you should have had
a better life

728
01:16:25,998 --> 01:16:29,875
Not at all. I like it this way

729
01:16:31,169 --> 01:16:34,088
You may be happy
while you're still young...

730
01:16:34,214 --> 01:16:40,344
...but as you get older,
you'll find it lonely

731
01:16:40,470 --> 01:16:44,181
I won't get that old,
so don't worry

732
01:16:46,518 --> 01:16:50,271
You're such a good person

733
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:53,733
Goodnight, then

734
01:17:07,331 --> 01:17:08,998
Goodnight

735
01:17:51,833 --> 01:17:54,126
Good evening!

736
01:17:57,464 --> 01:17:59,340
Hello? Hello?

737
01:18:00,384 --> 01:18:02,134
Mrs Kaneko?

738
01:18:02,260 --> 01:18:04,637
Yes? Who is it?

739
01:18:04,763 --> 01:18:06,889
Who could it be?

740
01:18:12,771 --> 01:18:16,524
- Who is it?
- The police. Officer Takahashi

741
01:18:16,650 --> 01:18:18,526
Oh, all right...

742
01:18:25,325 --> 01:18:28,786
Sorry for calling so late.
l’ve brought your friends round

743
01:18:28,912 --> 01:18:30,788
They're quite drunk

744
01:18:32,290 --> 01:18:34,709
Why, Father!

745
01:18:36,586 --> 01:18:38,379
- l’m terribly sorry
- Goodnight

746
01:18:52,769 --> 01:18:54,687
Who's he, Father?

747
01:19:01,361 --> 01:19:04,530
Father, what's all this?

748
01:19:05,574 --> 01:19:07,032
Father!

749
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:11,871
Hey, what's happened?

750
01:19:12,706 --> 01:19:15,291
- He's brought some stranger with him
- Who is it?

751
01:19:15,417 --> 01:19:18,377
- I don't know
- Stop all the noise!

752
01:19:20,213 --> 01:19:22,256
What's all this, Father?

753
01:19:22,382 --> 01:19:23,591
Father!

754
01:19:23,717 --> 01:19:27,595
- Father! What's all this?
- Well...

755
01:19:32,642 --> 01:19:37,271
Hopeless!
You've started drinking again!

756
01:19:39,399 --> 01:19:41,442
Hello? Hello?

757
01:19:41,568 --> 01:19:43,402
Hey, you! Hey, you!

758
01:19:47,866 --> 01:19:50,242
Father? Father!

759
01:19:51,036 --> 01:19:53,037
You're hopeless!

760
01:19:56,750 --> 01:19:59,794
What happened?
Where's he been drinking?

761
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:02,588
Where? How should I know?

762
01:20:03,715 --> 01:20:06,091
He used to drink all the time

763
01:20:06,218 --> 01:20:10,971
Used to come home blind drunk,
upsetting Mother

764
01:20:11,097 --> 01:20:13,265
We hated it

765
01:20:13,391 --> 01:20:16,769
But he stopped drinking
after Kyoko was born

766
01:20:16,895 --> 01:20:20,105
He was like a new man,
I thought it was great

767
01:20:20,232 --> 01:20:22,650
Now he's started again

768
01:20:29,825 --> 01:20:32,159
Hey, what shall we do?

769
01:20:32,285 --> 01:20:37,540
I didn't expect him back here tonight,
let alone with company!

770
01:20:48,343 --> 01:20:53,222
- We can't leave them there like that
- It can't be helped

771
01:20:53,348 --> 01:20:56,684
Let's bring Kiyo down
and we'll put them upstairs

772
01:20:57,727 --> 01:20:59,812
They're too drunk to make it upstairs

773
01:21:01,523 --> 01:21:04,024
What shall we do?

774
01:21:04,150 --> 01:21:06,068
What a mess!

775
01:21:08,154 --> 01:21:11,115
You sleep upstairs.
l’ll put them here

776
01:21:15,912 --> 01:21:17,454
What a bother!

777
01:21:18,582 --> 01:21:21,166
Why didn't he tell me
he was coming back?

778
01:21:23,128 --> 01:21:26,046
So late and so drunk!

779
01:21:27,507 --> 01:21:29,592
I hate drunkards

780
01:21:30,886 --> 01:21:34,346
And with a stranger, too

781
01:21:35,390 --> 01:21:37,516
Oh, I can't bear it!

782
01:22:24,439 --> 01:22:27,816
- Thank you for letting me stay
- Not at all

783
01:22:27,943 --> 01:22:30,402
l’m sorry the place is such a mess

784
01:22:32,739 --> 01:22:37,034
Won't you be late for work?
Will you be all right?

785
01:22:38,036 --> 01:22:40,120
Yes, l’ll be fine

786
01:22:52,092 --> 01:22:54,635
- Mother?
- What is it?

787
01:22:56,262 --> 01:22:58,681
I want you to have this

788
01:22:59,975 --> 01:23:03,143
- What is it?
- Spending money for you

789
01:23:03,269 --> 01:23:08,774
- What do you mean?
- It’s not much, though

790
01:23:08,900 --> 01:23:11,360
You don't have to do this!

791
01:23:11,486 --> 01:23:14,321
Please take it, Mother!

792
01:23:14,447 --> 01:23:17,491
- I couldn't possibly
- Please, Mother!

793
01:23:17,617 --> 01:23:20,285
- I couldn't...
- Please

794
01:23:22,038 --> 01:23:24,748
l’m the one who should be
giving you something

795
01:23:24,874 --> 01:23:28,377
Please accept it, Mother

796
01:23:28,503 --> 01:23:30,045
Please

797
01:23:31,214 --> 01:23:32,673
Must I?

798
01:23:32,799 --> 01:23:37,136
Then thank you very much, my dear

799
01:23:37,262 --> 01:23:38,721
Please

800
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:46,478
You must need money for yourself,
but still you do this for me

801
01:23:46,604 --> 01:23:49,523
I don't know what to say...

802
01:23:51,943 --> 01:23:54,153
...but thank you so much

803
01:23:54,279 --> 01:23:55,946
Thank you

804
01:23:57,198 --> 01:23:59,283
Let's get going, Mother

805
01:24:00,118 --> 01:24:01,535
Yes...

806
01:24:05,623 --> 01:24:10,836
If you come up to Tokyo again,
Mother, please visit me

807
01:24:13,923 --> 01:24:17,968
But I don't know
whether l’ll be able to...

808
01:24:19,512 --> 01:24:25,851
I know you're busy, but you should
try to come to Onomichi

809
01:24:26,686 --> 01:24:30,856
I'd really like to,
if only it were a bit nearer

810
01:24:30,982 --> 01:24:35,444
You're right. It’s so far away

811
01:24:58,885 --> 01:25:01,678
Mother, you forgot these

812
01:25:01,805 --> 01:25:05,474
Oh, again! l’ve got so forgetful lately

813
01:25:11,106 --> 01:25:13,524
Let's go, then

814
01:25:38,591 --> 01:25:41,969
Next Tokaido line departure
on Platform 14

815
01:25:42,095 --> 01:25:46,598
21:00 express to Hiroshima

816
01:26:17,964 --> 01:26:19,882
It’s packed, isn't it?

817
01:26:21,968 --> 01:26:24,803
But we're in a good position
to get seats here

818
01:26:25,680 --> 01:26:29,641
The train should arrive in Nagoya
or Gifu by morning

819
01:26:31,436 --> 01:26:34,688
- When does it arrive in Onomichi?
- 01:35 tomorrow afternoon

820
01:26:34,814 --> 01:26:38,734
Did you send Kyoko a telegram?

821
01:26:38,860 --> 01:26:40,652
Yes, I did

822
01:26:40,778 --> 01:26:43,322
Keizo will meet you at Osaka, too

823
01:26:44,866 --> 01:26:48,368
Mother, I hope you have
a good sleep on the train

824
01:26:48,494 --> 01:26:52,247
She can sleep soundly anywhere!

825
01:26:52,373 --> 01:26:56,668
Even if I don't,
l’ll be home tomorrow afternoon

826
01:26:56,794 --> 01:26:59,880
And Father, don't drink too much

827
01:27:00,006 --> 01:27:04,593
Well, last night's reunion
was an exception

828
01:27:04,719 --> 01:27:07,888
Has the headache gone?

829
01:27:09,015 --> 01:27:10,515
It’s fine

830
01:27:11,517 --> 01:27:13,852
Let this be a warning

831
01:27:15,313 --> 01:27:18,148
l’m sure it was a good lesson

832
01:27:18,274 --> 01:27:23,612
You've been very kind to us, all of you.
We enjoyed our trip

833
01:27:23,738 --> 01:27:28,700
Thanks for looking after us
when you have such busy lives

834
01:27:28,826 --> 01:27:33,789
Now that we've seen you all,
you needn't come down...

835
01:27:33,915 --> 01:27:36,833
...even if anything should happen
to either one of us

836
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:39,711
Don't talk like that, Mother

837
01:27:39,837 --> 01:27:41,672
This isn't a farewell

838
01:27:42,757 --> 01:27:46,510
I mean it. We live so far away

839
01:27:48,054 --> 01:27:53,350
Sorry for keeping you waiting.
The 21:00 departure is now ready...

840
01:28:36,561 --> 01:28:38,437
- Morning
- Morning

841
01:28:41,107 --> 01:28:44,735
- Morning
- Morning. Sorry about yesterday

842
01:28:50,325 --> 01:28:53,910
- I heard your parents came
- Yes. What a palaver

843
01:28:54,037 --> 01:28:58,332
They weren't supposed to get off
the train, but my mother became ill

844
01:28:59,334 --> 01:29:03,837
- What was the trouble?
- She didn't feel well here

845
01:29:03,963 --> 01:29:06,506
- Was it her heart?
- Travel sickness, I reckon

846
01:29:06,632 --> 01:29:09,426
She hadn't been on a train
for a long time

847
01:29:10,803 --> 01:29:13,013
What a drama

848
01:29:13,139 --> 01:29:17,642
I had to borrow blankets
and send for the doctor twice

849
01:29:19,020 --> 01:29:23,523
- And how is she now?
- She's feeling fine this morning

850
01:29:23,649 --> 01:29:25,233
How old is she?

851
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:27,361
Let me see...

852
01:29:27,487 --> 01:29:29,863
She's way over 60

853
01:29:29,989 --> 01:29:32,491
67 or 68, maybe

854
01:29:32,617 --> 01:29:34,910
Fairly old, then

855
01:29:35,036 --> 01:29:37,204
Take good care of her

856
01:29:37,330 --> 01:29:39,998
"Honour your parents
while they are still alive"

857
01:29:40,666 --> 01:29:42,292
That's right

858
01:29:42,418 --> 01:29:46,296
And they say, "One cannot serve
one's parents beyond the grave"

859
01:30:02,688 --> 01:30:05,690
It must've been
because the train was so crowded

860
01:30:05,817 --> 01:30:07,692
You're probably right

861
01:30:09,070 --> 01:30:12,447
- Feeling better?
- I feel fine now

862
01:30:20,873 --> 01:30:23,875
I should be able
to leave for home tonight

863
01:30:25,002 --> 01:30:30,257
Well, let's stay here one more night
and tomorrow take a less crowded train

864
01:30:33,386 --> 01:30:36,430
Kyoko must be worried about us

865
01:30:38,599 --> 01:30:44,688
But at least we're here in Osaka
and able to see Keizo

866
01:30:44,814 --> 01:30:49,067
In the past ten days
we've managed to see all our children

867
01:30:51,904 --> 01:30:54,906
And our grown-up grandchildren, too

868
01:30:56,033 --> 01:30:59,995
Some grandparents seem to prefer their
grandchildren more than their children

869
01:31:00,121 --> 01:31:01,580
What do you think?

870
01:31:02,748 --> 01:31:04,124
What about you?

871
01:31:04,959 --> 01:31:07,627
I prefer my own children

872
01:31:07,753 --> 01:31:09,463
I agree with you

873
01:31:09,589 --> 01:31:13,258
But it surprises me
how children change

874
01:31:14,469 --> 01:31:18,722
Shige used to be
a much nicer person before

875
01:31:18,848 --> 01:31:20,932
She did, didn't she?

876
01:31:21,058 --> 01:31:24,311
When a daughter marries,
she becomes a stranger

877
01:31:24,437 --> 01:31:29,524
Koichi has changed, too.
He used to be such a nice boy

878
01:31:29,650 --> 01:31:32,777
Children never live up
to their parents' expectations

879
01:31:34,947 --> 01:31:39,159
Let's just be happy that
they're better than most

880
01:31:39,285 --> 01:31:43,580
They're certainly
better than average

881
01:31:43,706 --> 01:31:46,249
We're fortunate

882
01:31:46,375 --> 01:31:48,835
I think so, too

883
01:31:48,961 --> 01:31:51,838
We should consider ourselves lucky

884
01:31:51,964 --> 01:31:55,634
Yes, we are very lucky

885
01:32:26,999 --> 01:32:30,043
My folks had to get off the train
at Osaka

886
01:32:30,169 --> 01:32:31,836
Oh, really?

887
01:32:37,593 --> 01:32:41,221
Mother became sick on the train

888
01:32:43,015 --> 01:32:44,933
They got home on the 10th

889
01:32:52,233 --> 01:32:54,150
Is she all right now?

890
01:32:54,277 --> 01:32:57,279
I think so.
They wrote to say thanks

891
01:32:57,405 --> 01:32:59,364
She must've been tired

892
01:33:01,200 --> 01:33:03,285
The trip was too much for her

893
01:33:04,787 --> 01:33:08,290
- Was she satisfied?
- Why wouldn't she be?

894
01:33:08,416 --> 01:33:11,501
She got to see lots of places
and went to Atami, too

895
01:33:11,627 --> 01:33:13,545
I suppose so

896
01:33:13,671 --> 01:33:16,298
She'll talk about Tokyo
for a long time to come

897
01:33:26,183 --> 01:33:27,726
Hello?

898
01:33:28,769 --> 01:33:30,228
Speaking...

899
01:33:31,564 --> 01:33:33,273
A telegram?

900
01:33:34,734 --> 01:33:36,693
Not yet. Where from?

901
01:33:36,819 --> 01:33:38,737
From Onomichi

902
01:33:38,863 --> 01:33:41,740
It came today, but it's very odd

903
01:33:41,866 --> 01:33:44,576
It says mother's critically ill

904
01:33:44,702 --> 01:33:48,079
Eh? That's right

905
01:33:48,205 --> 01:33:49,914
That's strange

906
01:33:50,041 --> 01:33:52,917
I just got a letter from father

907
01:33:55,087 --> 01:33:58,965
It says they got off at Osaka
because mother felt sick

908
01:33:59,091 --> 01:34:02,302
They arrived home in Onomichi
on the 10th

909
01:34:06,766 --> 01:34:07,891
That's right

910
01:34:09,268 --> 01:34:10,727
Telegram!

911
01:34:10,853 --> 01:34:12,437
Hold on

912
01:34:20,112 --> 01:34:21,571
Thank you

913
01:34:26,160 --> 01:34:28,286
- It’s from Onomichi
- Read it

914
01:34:31,499 --> 01:34:33,708
"Mother critically ill - Kyoko"

915
01:34:34,877 --> 01:34:37,295
Hello? Hello?

916
01:34:39,382 --> 01:34:41,466
The telegram just arrived

917
01:34:41,592 --> 01:34:43,885
You just got one too?

918
01:34:46,722 --> 01:34:49,474
Right, l’ll come over

919
01:34:52,478 --> 01:34:54,938
- See you later
- l’ll be waiting

920
01:34:56,941 --> 01:34:59,317
How did it happen so suddenly?

921
01:35:05,116 --> 01:35:07,158
I wonder if it's serious

922
01:35:08,828 --> 01:35:10,704
Should I let Noriko know?

923
01:35:10,830 --> 01:35:13,164
Yes, do that for me

924
01:36:00,254 --> 01:36:03,131
Yes? Yoneyama Trading Company

925
01:36:03,257 --> 01:36:05,675
Hold the line, please

926
01:36:10,639 --> 01:36:12,140
Miss Hirayama, telephone!

927
01:36:13,267 --> 01:36:14,976
For me?

928
01:36:25,279 --> 01:36:26,821
Hello?

929
01:36:26,947 --> 01:36:29,574
Oh, hello

930
01:36:32,036 --> 01:36:34,162
Mother is?

931
01:36:40,002 --> 01:36:41,586
Is that so?

932
01:36:47,218 --> 01:36:48,635
Thank you

933
01:37:41,063 --> 01:37:42,939
What can it mean?

934
01:37:43,065 --> 01:37:45,149
I can understand Father falling ill

935
01:37:46,485 --> 01:37:48,903
But Mother's got so much vitality

936
01:37:49,989 --> 01:37:51,489
Think it's serious?

937
01:37:53,158 --> 01:37:56,369
It’s not good.
They said "critically ill"

938
01:37:56,495 --> 01:37:59,539
I suppose we'll have to go then

939
01:38:01,375 --> 01:38:04,127
I sensed something wasn't right
at the station

940
01:38:04,253 --> 01:38:06,796
She said,
"If anything should happen..."

941
01:38:08,299 --> 01:38:12,010
She must've had a bad feeling,
somehow or other

942
01:38:13,929 --> 01:38:19,267
- Anyway, we should go and see her
- I guess so, since she's critically ill

943
01:38:19,393 --> 01:38:22,312
If we're going, we better hurry.
We should take the express

944
01:38:23,772 --> 01:38:28,902
l’ll have to make all kinds
of arrangements before I leave

945
01:38:29,028 --> 01:38:31,070
So will I

946
01:38:31,196 --> 01:38:34,115
In the middle of this busy time, too

947
01:38:48,839 --> 01:38:50,340
Come in

948
01:38:51,216 --> 01:38:54,135
Hey, can you bring a bandage?

949
01:38:55,596 --> 01:38:57,096
A bandage

950
01:39:02,561 --> 01:39:04,896
Let's leave tonight, then

951
01:39:05,022 --> 01:39:08,733
Might as well, if we have to go.
See you later

952
01:39:12,738 --> 01:39:14,197
Brother?

953
01:39:15,532 --> 01:39:16,991
What is it?

954
01:39:17,743 --> 01:39:20,411
What about mourning clothes?
Shall we take them?

955
01:39:23,248 --> 01:39:25,124
Maybe we should

956
01:39:25,250 --> 01:39:28,002
All right, let's take them

957
01:39:28,128 --> 01:39:30,630
Let's just hope
we don't need to use them

958
01:39:30,756 --> 01:39:34,384
- Right
- l’ll meet you at Tokyo Station

959
01:40:27,187 --> 01:40:29,230
l’ll go and meet them, Father

960
01:40:30,941 --> 01:40:33,735
That's very good of you

961
01:41:15,486 --> 01:41:17,361
l’ll be back soon

962
01:41:42,221 --> 01:41:43,888
What's the matter?

963
01:41:47,893 --> 01:41:49,727
Are you too hot?

964
01:41:51,563 --> 01:41:55,024
The children are coming from Tokyo
to see you

965
01:41:55,150 --> 01:41:57,568
Kyoko's just gone to meet them

966
01:41:57,694 --> 01:42:00,404
They'll be here any moment

967
01:42:24,012 --> 01:42:28,349
You'll get better

968
01:42:29,768 --> 01:42:31,352
You will...

969
01:43:22,029 --> 01:43:26,532
Her blood pressure's dropped,
but she's still in a coma

970
01:43:26,658 --> 01:43:28,284
I see

971
01:43:42,007 --> 01:43:43,841
Her reactions are weak

972
01:43:44,927 --> 01:43:48,012
- Thank you, anyway
- l’ll drop by again

973
01:43:48,138 --> 01:43:50,014
Thank you for coming

974
01:43:59,024 --> 01:44:00,608
Take care

975
01:44:24,633 --> 01:44:28,052
I wonder where Keizo is.
He's so late

976
01:44:33,350 --> 01:44:37,561
- Did he answer the telegram?
- No, not a word

977
01:44:42,651 --> 01:44:46,279
But he lives in Osaka,
the closest of all of us

978
01:44:50,409 --> 01:44:53,452
Father, come with me

979
01:44:53,578 --> 01:44:55,204
You as well

980
01:45:12,931 --> 01:45:16,976
Listen, Father,
I don't like her condition

981
01:45:17,102 --> 01:45:18,728
I see...

982
01:45:26,695 --> 01:45:29,280
What do you mean?

983
01:45:29,406 --> 01:45:31,782
I mean it's dangerous

984
01:45:33,702 --> 01:45:37,830
The fact that she's still in a coma
isn't a good sign

985
01:45:37,956 --> 01:45:39,790
I see...

986
01:45:39,916 --> 01:45:43,461
Did the trip to Tokyo exhaust her
and bring this on?

987
01:45:43,587 --> 01:45:48,591
I don't think so. She was so lively
in Tokyo. Wasn't she?

988
01:45:51,636 --> 01:45:55,556
- It might've caused it
- So what is it, then?

989
01:45:57,225 --> 01:45:59,602
She may not live till tomorrow morning

990
01:46:00,312 --> 01:46:01,979
Tomorrow morning?

991
01:46:03,565 --> 01:46:05,983
It'll probably happen around dawn

992
01:46:06,943 --> 01:46:10,279
I see...
She's not going to live

993
01:46:17,245 --> 01:46:20,831
Mother's 68, isn't she?

994
01:46:23,210 --> 01:46:27,338
So... she's not going to live

995
01:46:28,965 --> 01:46:30,591
That's what I think

996
01:46:32,010 --> 01:46:33,511
I see...

997
01:46:35,097 --> 01:46:38,057
So this is the end?

998
01:46:39,684 --> 01:46:41,685
That's all

999
01:47:10,048 --> 01:47:12,550
Then Keizo won't be in time, will he?

1000
01:48:51,983 --> 01:48:54,944
Life's too short, isn't it?

1001
01:48:56,905 --> 01:48:58,989
She was so lively, too

1002
01:49:01,159 --> 01:49:03,577
She must've had a feeling
this would happen

1003
01:49:05,705 --> 01:49:07,164
Perhaps

1004
01:49:11,211 --> 01:49:13,921
Still, l’m glad she came to Tokyo

1005
01:49:15,006 --> 01:49:17,383
We were able to see her alive

1006
01:49:19,177 --> 01:49:21,220
And we talked about many things

1007
01:49:22,514 --> 01:49:26,058
Noriko, did you bring
any mourning clothes?

1008
01:49:26,184 --> 01:49:29,853
- No
- You should've brought some

1009
01:49:30,981 --> 01:49:33,232
Do you have any, Kyoko?

1010
01:49:33,358 --> 01:49:35,109
No, I don't

1011
01:49:35,235 --> 01:49:37,486
You'll have to borrow some, then

1012
01:49:37,612 --> 01:49:39,863
And get some for Noriko, too

1013
01:49:47,747 --> 01:49:53,210
At least mother died peacefully
and without suffering at all

1014
01:49:56,881 --> 01:49:58,966
I wonder if that's Keizo

1015
01:50:08,393 --> 01:50:10,311
How is she?

1016
01:50:18,987 --> 01:50:21,905
So... I wasn't in time

1017
01:50:24,326 --> 01:50:26,410
I was afraid of that

1018
01:50:35,003 --> 01:50:36,420
Good day

1019
01:50:39,841 --> 01:50:43,177
Unfortunately,
I was out of town on business

1020
01:50:43,303 --> 01:50:45,679
l’m sorry l’m late

1021
01:50:46,931 --> 01:50:50,100
- The telegram came while I was away
- Really?

1022
01:50:52,062 --> 01:50:54,647
How awful...

1023
01:50:54,773 --> 01:50:56,231
When was it?

1024
01:50:57,525 --> 01:51:01,487
This morning... at 3:15

1025
01:51:01,613 --> 01:51:03,113
I see...

1026
01:51:04,532 --> 01:51:08,952
If I'd taken the 8:40 train from
Kagoshima, I would've been in time

1027
01:51:10,038 --> 01:51:14,833
Keizo, look at her.
See how peaceful she is

1028
01:51:50,620 --> 01:51:53,080
Forgive my delay

1029
01:52:03,883 --> 01:52:05,509
Where's father?

1030
01:52:06,720 --> 01:52:08,178
I wonder

1031
01:52:42,922 --> 01:52:44,381
Father...

1032
01:52:45,425 --> 01:52:48,552
- Keizo has just arrived
- Has he?

1033
01:52:50,388 --> 01:52:53,390
It was such a beautiful dawn

1034
01:52:57,562 --> 01:53:00,481
It’s going to be another hot day today

1035
01:55:27,837 --> 01:55:29,338
What's the matter?

1036
01:55:30,214 --> 01:55:32,382
I can't stand that sound

1037
01:55:33,801 --> 01:55:35,302
Why?

1038
01:55:36,304 --> 01:55:41,224
As I hear it, I feel as if my mother
were becoming smaller, bit by bit

1039
01:55:42,936 --> 01:55:45,354
I wasn't a very good son

1040
01:55:52,779 --> 01:55:54,905
It’s time to offer incense

1041
01:55:56,991 --> 01:55:59,451
I can't lose her now

1042
01:55:59,577 --> 01:56:03,080
"One cannot serve one's parents
beyond the grave"

1043
01:56:45,498 --> 01:56:49,251
We used to watch fireworks
from this room, didn't we, Father?

1044
01:56:49,377 --> 01:56:51,545
Oh, did we?

1045
01:56:51,671 --> 01:56:54,339
On the night of the town festival

1046
01:56:54,465 --> 01:56:57,134
- Remember, Keizo?
- No, I don't

1047
01:56:57,260 --> 01:57:02,180
You were so excited,
but after sunset you fell asleep

1048
01:57:02,306 --> 01:57:05,017
With your head on mother's lap

1049
01:57:05,143 --> 01:57:07,310
I really don't remember

1050
01:57:09,022 --> 01:57:11,523
What were you doing
in those days, Father?

1051
01:57:12,650 --> 01:57:16,111
I was head of the city's
board of education, I believe

1052
01:57:16,237 --> 01:57:19,406
Were you?
A long time ago, wasn't it?

1053
01:57:20,408 --> 01:57:23,201
Once we all went to Omishima
during the spring holidays

1054
01:57:23,327 --> 01:57:26,371
Oh, that I do remember

1055
01:57:26,497 --> 01:57:31,543
- Mother got seasick
- Yes, I remember that

1056
01:57:33,629 --> 01:57:36,131
She was so full of life then

1057
01:57:36,257 --> 01:57:39,676
How old was she then? Forty...?

1058
01:57:40,428 --> 01:57:44,139
Forty-two or forty-three, I think

1059
01:57:44,265 --> 01:57:47,642
You have to take good care
of yourself now, Father...

1060
01:57:47,769 --> 01:57:49,728
...and enjoy a long life

1061
01:57:49,854 --> 01:57:51,521
Thank you

1062
01:58:02,283 --> 01:58:04,201
Some more?

1063
01:58:10,083 --> 01:58:11,875
More, sis?

1064
01:58:23,596 --> 01:58:27,265
It may sound heartless to say so...

1065
01:58:27,391 --> 01:58:30,477
...but I rather wish father had died first

1066
01:58:32,730 --> 01:58:35,732
If Kyoko gets married,
he'll be left all alone

1067
01:58:37,693 --> 01:58:38,985
Maybe

1068
01:58:39,112 --> 01:58:42,489
We could've looked
after mother in Tokyo

1069
01:58:43,741 --> 01:58:48,787
Kyoko, did mother still have
that grey summer sash?

1070
01:58:48,913 --> 01:58:51,123
- Yes
- I'd like it as a memento

1071
01:58:51,249 --> 01:58:53,917
- Is that all right, Brother?
- Why not?

1072
01:58:54,043 --> 01:58:55,544
And also...

1073
01:58:57,004 --> 01:58:59,422
...that linen kimono
she used to wear in summer?

1074
01:58:59,549 --> 01:59:01,591
- It’s here
- I want that, too

1075
01:59:01,717 --> 01:59:04,511
You know where it is?
Get it out for me

1076
01:59:17,817 --> 01:59:21,194
It’s all over now

1077
01:59:22,405 --> 01:59:28,118
Thank you all for coming so far
and giving up your precious time

1078
01:59:29,370 --> 01:59:30,954
Thank you

1079
01:59:38,087 --> 01:59:42,132
She would've been pleased
to know Koichi looked after her

1080
01:59:44,844 --> 01:59:47,095
I didn't really do anything

1081
01:59:48,181 --> 01:59:54,144
I remember when we went
to Atami from Tokyo...

1082
01:59:54,270 --> 01:59:58,231
...she had a dizzy spell

1083
01:59:59,817 --> 02:00:04,529
- Oh?
- It didn't seem that serious

1084
02:00:04,655 --> 02:00:08,700
Really? Why didn't you tell us, Father?

1085
02:00:08,826 --> 02:00:11,411
You should've told Koichi at least

1086
02:00:12,914 --> 02:00:14,998
I guess I should have

1087
02:00:16,876 --> 02:00:19,920
But that wasn't the cause

1088
02:00:20,046 --> 02:00:23,381
Mother was overweight,
so the illness came on suddenly

1089
02:00:23,507 --> 02:00:24,925
I see...

1090
02:00:26,886 --> 02:00:29,054
It’s just like a dream

1091
02:00:30,264 --> 02:00:34,809
- When are you leaving, Brother?
- I can't stay long

1092
02:00:34,936 --> 02:00:38,396
Me neither.
Shall we take the express tonight?

1093
02:00:39,941 --> 02:00:43,526
- What about you, Keizo?
- I can stay

1094
02:00:44,946 --> 02:00:47,239
- Let's leave tonight, then
- Right

1095
02:00:47,365 --> 02:00:50,784
Noriko, you'll stay with father
a bit longer, won't you?

1096
02:00:50,910 --> 02:00:53,912
- Yes
- No, you're busy. l’ll be fine

1097
02:00:54,038 --> 02:00:58,500
I might as well go, then.
I have to make a report.

1098
02:00:58,626 --> 02:01:01,586
And there's that baseball match, too

1099
02:01:01,712 --> 02:01:05,590
Well, thanks for coming
when you're so busy

1100
02:01:05,716 --> 02:01:08,593
You'll be lonely now, Father

1101
02:01:08,719 --> 02:01:11,596
l’ll get used to it

1102
02:01:11,722 --> 02:01:14,391
Kyoko, pass me some more rice

1103
02:01:15,685 --> 02:01:18,311
Get the train tickets for us,
will you, Keizo?

1104
02:01:18,437 --> 02:01:21,189
Yes. Rice for me, too

1105
02:01:25,903 --> 02:01:28,113
I hope the train's empty

1106
02:01:51,095 --> 02:01:54,264
Father, you mustn't drink too much

1107
02:01:54,390 --> 02:01:56,766
l’ll be all right

1108
02:02:03,607 --> 02:02:06,943
So, you're all going home?

1109
02:03:05,294 --> 02:03:08,004
- Here's your lunch
- Thank you so much

1110
02:03:10,758 --> 02:03:13,760
Thanks for letting me stay

1111
02:03:13,886 --> 02:03:17,180
Come and see me in Tokyo
in your summer holidays

1112
02:03:17,306 --> 02:03:21,768
- Do you have to go home today?
- Yes, I must

1113
02:03:21,894 --> 02:03:23,353
Really?

1114
02:03:24,438 --> 02:03:27,649
- Sorry I can't see you off
- That's all right

1115
02:03:29,068 --> 02:03:32,195
Do come and see me
in the summer holidays

1116
02:03:34,240 --> 02:03:37,826
l’m so glad you stayed

1117
02:03:39,328 --> 02:03:43,373
I think my brothers and sister
should have stayed a bit longer

1118
02:03:44,083 --> 02:03:46,084
But they're very busy

1119
02:03:46,210 --> 02:03:48,336
They're just selfish

1120
02:03:49,213 --> 02:03:52,590
Demanding things
and then leaving just like that

1121
02:03:52,716 --> 02:03:56,219
That can't be helped.
They have work to get back to

1122
02:03:57,805 --> 02:04:00,432
But you have yours too

1123
02:04:00,558 --> 02:04:04,727
- They think only of themselves
- But Kyoko...

1124
02:04:06,397 --> 02:04:09,858
Asking for mementos of mother
right after her death!

1125
02:04:10,901 --> 02:04:14,612
I felt so sorry for poor mother

1126
02:04:15,739 --> 02:04:20,535
Even strangers would have been
more considerate

1127
02:04:22,705 --> 02:04:27,083
But look, Kyoko,
I thought so too when I was your age

1128
02:04:28,419 --> 02:04:33,256
But, as children get older,
they drift away from their parents

1129
02:04:35,509 --> 02:04:39,637
A woman has her own life,
apart from her parents...

1130
02:04:39,763 --> 02:04:42,182
...when she becomes Shige's age

1131
02:04:43,726 --> 02:04:47,479
So she meant no harm, l’m sure

1132
02:04:48,939 --> 02:04:53,151
They have their own lives to look after

1133
02:04:53,986 --> 02:04:55,987
I wonder...

1134
02:04:56,113 --> 02:04:58,156
But I won't ever be like that

1135
02:04:58,282 --> 02:05:00,867
Otherwise what's the point
of being part of a family?

1136
02:05:01,619 --> 02:05:03,453
You're right

1137
02:05:03,579 --> 02:05:09,167
But all children become like that
eventually

1138
02:05:09,293 --> 02:05:11,127
You, too?

1139
02:05:12,796 --> 02:05:16,382
I may become like that,
in spite of myself

1140
02:05:17,927 --> 02:05:20,803
Isn't life disappointing?

1141
02:05:20,930 --> 02:05:24,349
Yes, nothing but disappointment

1142
02:05:29,813 --> 02:05:35,026
- Well, I should get going
- Goodbye, then

1143
02:05:35,152 --> 02:05:37,320
Father, l’m leaving now

1144
02:05:45,204 --> 02:05:50,124
- Take care of yourself
- Thank you. You, too

1145
02:05:51,627 --> 02:05:54,212
Come and see me
in the summer holidays

1146
02:05:56,340 --> 02:05:58,174
Goodbye, then

1147
02:05:59,260 --> 02:06:02,345
- Goodbye
- See you soon

1148
02:06:18,028 --> 02:06:20,863
- Goodbye
- Goodbye

1149
02:06:56,609 --> 02:06:59,068
Has Kyoko left?

1150
02:07:04,116 --> 02:07:09,120
Father, l’m leaving
on the afternoon train

1151
02:07:09,246 --> 02:07:11,748
Oh? You're going home?

1152
02:07:13,042 --> 02:07:14,959
Thank you for everything

1153
02:07:15,085 --> 02:07:17,545
Please, I didn't do anything

1154
02:07:17,671 --> 02:07:21,424
- You've been a great help
- Not at all

1155
02:07:24,845 --> 02:07:29,432
My wife told me
how kind you were to her...

1156
02:07:29,558 --> 02:07:31,934
...when she stayed
at your place in Tokyo

1157
02:07:32,061 --> 02:07:36,356
Not at all.
I didn't have much to offer

1158
02:07:36,482 --> 02:07:39,359
Well, she really meant it

1159
02:07:39,485 --> 02:07:42,987
She told me that evening with you
was her happiest time in Tokyo

1160
02:07:43,113 --> 02:07:47,950
- I want to thank you, too
- Not at all

1161
02:07:54,792 --> 02:08:00,338
She was so worried
about your future

1162
02:08:00,464 --> 02:08:03,174
You mustn't go on like this

1163
02:08:03,300 --> 02:08:05,134
Don't worry about me

1164
02:08:05,260 --> 02:08:08,471
You should get remarried
if you meet the right man

1165
02:08:10,140 --> 02:08:13,351
Just forget about Shoji

1166
02:08:14,895 --> 02:08:21,651
It pains me to see you
living like this

1167
02:08:22,903 --> 02:08:26,155
No, it's not like that

1168
02:08:26,281 --> 02:08:32,829
She said she'd never met
a nicer woman than you

1169
02:08:34,081 --> 02:08:37,792
l’m sure she was overestimating me

1170
02:08:37,918 --> 02:08:40,378
She certainly wasn't

1171
02:08:40,504 --> 02:08:45,591
l’m not the nice woman
she thought I was

1172
02:08:46,885 --> 02:08:52,807
It embarrasses me that
you should think of me like that

1173
02:08:52,933 --> 02:08:55,393
Well, it shouldn't

1174
02:08:55,519 --> 02:08:58,646
Really, I can be quite selfish

1175
02:09:00,023 --> 02:09:06,821
l’m not always thinking of your late son,
though you may think I am

1176
02:09:07,614 --> 02:09:10,575
You should just forget him

1177
02:09:11,201 --> 02:09:17,039
Often, there are days
when I don't think of him at all

1178
02:09:19,877 --> 02:09:24,213
Sometimes I feel
I can't go on like this forever

1179
02:09:25,215 --> 02:09:31,637
Often I lay awake at night wondering
what will become of me if I remain alone

1180
02:09:32,890 --> 02:09:36,934
Days pass and nothing happens,
and I feel so alone

1181
02:09:38,270 --> 02:09:42,023
In my heart,
I seem to be waiting for something

1182
02:09:44,610 --> 02:09:48,112
- l’m just being selfish
- No, you're not

1183
02:09:48,238 --> 02:09:49,781
Yes, I am

1184
02:09:51,408 --> 02:09:54,869
But I couldn't say this to mother

1185
02:09:55,913 --> 02:09:57,705
That's all right

1186
02:09:57,831 --> 02:10:01,584
You truly are a good woman.
An honest woman

1187
02:10:03,879 --> 02:10:05,379
Not at all

1188
02:10:32,741 --> 02:10:35,785
This watch belonged to her

1189
02:10:35,911 --> 02:10:38,788
It’s rather old-fashioned...

1190
02:10:38,914 --> 02:10:42,917
...but she used it
since she was your age

1191
02:10:43,043 --> 02:10:45,169
Please take it as a memento

1192
02:10:45,295 --> 02:10:48,798
- But I...
- Please take it

1193
02:10:50,300 --> 02:10:55,054
l’m sure she'd be very happy
if you used it

1194
02:10:56,223 --> 02:10:58,891
Please take it

1195
02:10:59,810 --> 02:11:01,310
Thank you

1196
02:11:05,858 --> 02:11:12,196
Please believe me when I say
that I want you to be happy

1197
02:11:12,322 --> 02:11:15,491
I mean it sincerely

1198
02:11:28,505 --> 02:11:30,256
It’s strange...

1199
02:11:30,382 --> 02:11:32,884
We have children of our own...

1200
02:11:33,010 --> 02:11:38,681
...yet you've done the most for us,
and you're not even a blood relative

1201
02:11:39,683 --> 02:11:41,684
Thank you

1202
02:14:09,833 --> 02:14:13,502
You must be feeling lonely
with them all gone

1203
02:14:14,504 --> 02:14:17,214
It was so sudden, wasn't it?

1204
02:14:17,340 --> 02:14:20,718
Well, she was a headstrong woman...

1205
02:14:20,844 --> 02:14:23,220
...but if I'd known things
would come to this...

1206
02:14:23,346 --> 02:14:27,475
...I'd have been kinder to her
while she was alive

1207
02:14:28,977 --> 02:14:32,438
Living alone,
I think the days will seem very long

1208
02:14:32,564 --> 02:14:34,106
Absolutely

1209
02:14:34,232 --> 02:14:36,233
You'll feel lonely

1210
02:15:42,801 --> 02:15:46,971
The End
