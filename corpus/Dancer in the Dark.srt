1
00:03:25,233 --> 00:03:26,442
- You're sweatin'.
- I know!

2
00:03:26,942 --> 00:03:29,900
I'm excited, though.
I can see it all happening.

3
00:03:33,983 --> 00:03:36,942
A little turn. Now side to side.

4
00:03:37,067 --> 00:03:40,192
- # Raindrops and roses...
- Other people can sing.

5
00:03:40,275 --> 00:03:41,692
#.. on kittens

6
00:03:41,775 --> 00:03:45,900
# White copper kettles
and warm woollen mittens

7
00:03:45,942 --> 00:03:49,858
# Brown paper packages
tied up with string

8
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:53,983
# These are a few
of my favourite things... #

9
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:56,983
- Can we talk?
- But she's fantastic.

10
00:03:57,108 --> 00:03:59,275
- I think she sings funny.
- God!

11
00:03:59,358 --> 00:04:02,817
- Her dancing's not great either.
- It's the first time she did it.

12
00:04:02,858 --> 00:04:06,108
Bum bum-bum, bum bum-bum,
bum bum-bum...

13
00:04:06,192 --> 00:04:10,567
But I had the kettle by then,
she didn't take the kettle.

14
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,650
Do you want me to...

15
00:04:12,733 --> 00:04:16,275
No, I just want Kathy
to put it here. This is...

16
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:20,650
You say these words, put
your hands out and they're there.

17
00:04:20,733 --> 00:04:24,067
# These are a few
of my favourite things... #

18
00:04:24,108 --> 00:04:26,400
Please, don't drop the props, Kathy.

19
00:04:26,483 --> 00:04:30,150
# Cream-coloured ponies
and apple strudels

20
00:04:30,275 --> 00:04:33,692
# Doorbells and sleigh bells
and schnitzel with noodles... #

21
00:04:33,817 --> 00:04:38,525
Why are you putting it
on her head? I'm a little confused.

22
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:41,900
I don't know... Because she's not
going to pick it up.

23
00:04:41,942 --> 00:04:45,233
It looks like you're trying to put
a hat on her head.

24
00:04:45,358 --> 00:04:48,942
You're fantastic. You just have
to listen to your heart, Cvalda.

25
00:04:49,025 --> 00:04:51,858
I don't want you to call me Cvalda.

26
00:04:51,942 --> 00:04:53,525
You're Cvalda to me.

27
00:04:53,608 --> 00:04:55,275
Let's do some sound effects.

28
00:04:55,317 --> 00:04:57,983
- Uh! # When the dog bites
- Woof!

29
00:04:58,025 --> 00:04:59,942
- # When the bee stings
- Ouch!

30
00:05:00,025 --> 00:05:03,067
# When I'm feeling sad...

31
00:05:03,108 --> 00:05:05,567
- # When the dog bites
- Woof!

32
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:07,025
# When the... #

33
00:05:07,067 --> 00:05:10,858
- I'm not barking.
- #.. I'm feeling sad

34
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:17,400
# And then I don't feel so bad #

35
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,275
Wait!

36
00:05:22,358 --> 00:05:25,233
I told you no tapping
in "The Sound of Music"!

37
00:05:25,275 --> 00:05:27,942
It needs rhythm,
like drums or something.

38
00:05:28,025 --> 00:05:31,400
Everybody's doing
a great job.

39
00:05:32,233 --> 00:05:33,192
Really.

40
00:05:50,233 --> 00:05:53,608
- Hello, Selma. Come in. Ready?
- Yeah.

41
00:05:53,692 --> 00:05:56,817
- OK, you know where to stand.
- Yeah.

42
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,858
Let's try this one.

43
00:05:59,483 --> 00:06:02,108
F- E-Z-D

44
00:06:02,192 --> 00:06:03,942
Maybe the last one.

45
00:06:04,025 --> 00:06:07,317
D- E-F-P-O

46
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,275
I think you can work
that machine safely.

47
00:06:10,358 --> 00:06:13,192
I'll write a note to the plant.

48
00:06:13,317 --> 00:06:14,942
OK, thank you.

49
00:06:15,025 --> 00:06:16,358
Bye.

50
00:06:16,442 --> 00:06:18,108
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

51
00:06:18,192 --> 00:06:20,233
Bye.

52
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:26,150
# So long, farewell,
auf wiedersehen, adieu... #

53
00:06:29,483 --> 00:06:33,025
# I'd like to stay
and taste my French champagne

54
00:06:33,108 --> 00:06:34,567
# Ah-ha!

55
00:06:34,692 --> 00:06:38,442
# So long, farewell,
auf wiedersehen, adieu #

56
00:06:47,858 --> 00:06:52,358
We lost five hours cos some
idiot broke the machine.

57
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,775
- Bill's here.
- So?

58
00:06:56,108 --> 00:06:58,150
Well, he's here with Gene.

59
00:06:58,233 --> 00:07:00,942
That sounds like bad news.

60
00:07:00,983 --> 00:07:03,483
What are you going to do?

61
00:07:03,567 --> 00:07:06,150
I guess I gotta tell her, don't I?

62
00:07:07,233 --> 00:07:08,900
# So long... #

63
00:07:10,275 --> 00:07:13,150
You can't bring the script
to work, Selma.

64
00:07:13,192 --> 00:07:15,983
Keep your eyes on the machine, OK?

65
00:07:16,067 --> 00:07:17,858
Yeah.

66
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,692
Sure, sure.

67
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:24,025
Bill's here.

68
00:07:24,108 --> 00:07:25,442
Bill?

69
00:07:25,525 --> 00:07:27,400
He's here with Gene.

70
00:07:29,025 --> 00:07:30,983
Damn.

71
00:07:31,608 --> 00:07:33,275
Not again.

72
00:07:33,358 --> 00:07:35,442
You gotta come right back, OK?

73
00:07:41,442 --> 00:07:43,400
Don't be too worried.

74
00:07:44,067 --> 00:07:46,483
We'll work this out. Here she comes.

75
00:07:52,192 --> 00:07:54,817
Why are you not in school?

76
00:07:56,358 --> 00:07:59,025
When I say so you go to school.

77
00:07:59,067 --> 00:08:02,025
Do you think I joke?
You have to study!

78
00:08:02,067 --> 00:08:04,567
Come on, Selma, stop.

79
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:08,608
We talked about this, didn't we?

80
00:08:08,692 --> 00:08:10,942
Hanging out with those
automobile thieves.

81
00:08:11,025 --> 00:08:13,317
- So what?
- He's learning.

82
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,358
Selma, he's learning.

83
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:19,442
Gene, this is the most
important thing.

84
00:08:19,483 --> 00:08:21,483
You have to go to school.

85
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:26,192
I- I-I can drive him back to school.

86
00:08:26,233 --> 00:08:28,817
Since when was that your business?

87
00:08:28,858 --> 00:08:30,817
If you need a ride home...

88
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,983
I- I don't even punch out
till another two hours.

89
00:08:34,067 --> 00:08:37,983
- Sometimes you punch out around now.
- I never punch out early!

90
00:08:38,067 --> 00:08:42,775
Don't need a dump!
Don't need a ride!

91
00:08:42,858 --> 00:08:45,192
.. in your little head.

92
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:47,733
Let's get you to school, Mr G.

93
00:09:07,275 --> 00:09:11,442
Thank you, but... I'll just,
I'll just ride my bike.

94
00:09:12,775 --> 00:09:15,275
Bye, Jeff.

95
00:09:17,817 --> 00:09:19,692
She likes you.

96
00:09:19,775 --> 00:09:21,692
I'm sure of it.

97
00:09:21,775 --> 00:09:25,483
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure of it.

98
00:09:27,983 --> 00:09:32,358
This is my punishment,
that you help me with this.

99
00:09:32,442 --> 00:09:34,317
And you've got...

100
00:09:35,483 --> 00:09:38,442
You've got to make your bed as well.

101
00:09:40,067 --> 00:09:44,358
And you forgot to wrap up
the bread... two times.

102
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:49,858
There's no more of that.
You keep reading.

103
00:09:49,942 --> 00:09:54,442
"So long, farewell,
auf... wiedersehen,

104
00:09:54,525 --> 00:09:59,358
"adieu, adieu, adieu
to yieu and yieu and yieu. "

105
00:10:01,358 --> 00:10:06,192
To "yieu" and "yieu"...
What does that mean...

106
00:10:07,275 --> 00:10:08,733
"yieu"?

107
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:13,400
- It's your dumb musical.
- And yieu?

108
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,900
It's German.

109
00:10:16,025 --> 00:10:17,942
Do you think?

110
00:10:25,567 --> 00:10:28,942
- Y-you want some more ketchup?
- No.

111
00:10:36,025 --> 00:10:38,358
Are you tired?

112
00:10:42,025 --> 00:10:48,650
Wh-Why should you... always
ask me so, so stupid questions?

113
00:10:52,567 --> 00:10:54,692
Shall I show you my step?

114
00:10:58,317 --> 00:11:03,483
# So long, farewell,
auf wiedersehen, adieu

115
00:11:03,567 --> 00:11:04,942
# So long... #

116
00:11:04,983 --> 00:11:08,525
- Oh, hi.
- Hi, Gene. Hi.

117
00:11:08,608 --> 00:11:10,358
How's the dancin'?

118
00:11:10,442 --> 00:11:14,067
- Oh, good, yeah.
- Yeah?

119
00:11:14,192 --> 00:11:19,067
You want to come to me and Bill's
place and listen to some music?

120
00:11:19,192 --> 00:11:23,900
That... that would be lovely.
But we couldn't.

121
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:26,900
- Come on. Come on.
- Yeah, I'll...

122
00:11:26,942 --> 00:11:29,025
Let's go. Come on.

123
00:11:37,317 --> 00:11:39,775
You should ask Bill about his money.

124
00:11:39,817 --> 00:11:42,858
Linda likes it
when we talk about that.

125
00:11:44,858 --> 00:11:47,358
You're doing a nice job of these.

126
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,400
How about that?

127
00:11:49,483 --> 00:11:53,942
You have to be very careful
not to bend the card.

128
00:11:54,067 --> 00:11:57,233
Otherwise I don't get paid for it.

129
00:11:57,275 --> 00:11:58,692
No?!

130
00:11:58,817 --> 00:12:01,775
That's fair, because the people
in the shops

131
00:12:01,817 --> 00:12:04,400
would never buy it if it's bent.

132
00:12:04,483 --> 00:12:08,400
- You wouldn't buy it if it was bent.
- That's true. No.

133
00:12:17,358 --> 00:12:20,525
In Czechoslovakia... I saw a film

134
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:24,692
and they were eating candy
from a tin just like this.

135
00:12:24,733 --> 00:12:27,442
- No
- I thought to myself...

136
00:12:28,817 --> 00:12:32,817
how wonderful it must be
in the United States.

137
00:12:34,358 --> 00:12:37,483
Yeah? You think
my house looks like a movie?

138
00:12:37,567 --> 00:12:42,067
- Our house looks like a movie!
- You look like a movie star.

139
00:12:43,192 --> 00:12:46,483
Bill gives me a lot of money,
you know.

140
00:12:46,525 --> 00:12:50,692
Of course, it's all that money
you inherited, Bill.

141
00:12:50,775 --> 00:12:52,942
That's right.

142
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,858
Hey, Selma...

143
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,067
Are you sure?

144
00:14:15,483 --> 00:14:18,358
- Hello.
- Good morning.

145
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:20,483
Got the rent.

146
00:14:20,608 --> 00:14:23,692
Oh, you always pay right on time.

147
00:14:23,817 --> 00:14:26,983
Don't worry about Gene,
I'll get him to school.

148
00:14:27,108 --> 00:14:29,317
Thank you. Thanks very much.

149
00:14:29,358 --> 00:14:31,358
Remember your bag.

150
00:14:32,525 --> 00:14:35,358
- Bye.
- Bye.

151
00:14:37,108 --> 00:14:39,067
You're always so serious, Kathy.

152
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:41,067
Ah, again we start.

153
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:45,025
I don't think
inside you're serious at all.

154
00:14:45,067 --> 00:14:47,025
I don't know.

155
00:14:47,608 --> 00:14:49,733
- Not always.
- Cvalda.

156
00:14:49,817 --> 00:14:54,442
- Why do you call me that?
- It's like... someone who's...

157
00:14:55,608 --> 00:14:57,983
- What?
- Dunno, big and happy.

158
00:14:58,067 --> 00:15:01,983
Hey! I'm not that big.
Happy, I don't know.

159
00:15:02,025 --> 00:15:05,442
You just need someone
to pull it out.

160
00:15:05,525 --> 00:15:10,275
# You're getting to be
a habit with me... #

161
00:15:10,358 --> 00:15:14,650
- Beautiful eyes.
- Yeah. But he's not happy.

162
00:15:16,275 --> 00:15:18,108
How's she doing?

163
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:23,483
It's when she cannot keep up
and she is going to faint.

164
00:15:23,608 --> 00:15:24,942
She fainted.

165
00:15:25,067 --> 00:15:28,442
- Please, be quiet.
- She doesn't see that well.

166
00:15:28,483 --> 00:15:32,483
- I paid good money to see this.
- So did she.

167
00:15:34,525 --> 00:15:36,483
I love it when they dance.

168
00:15:36,608 --> 00:15:39,525
It's a musical,
of course they're dancing!

169
00:15:39,608 --> 00:15:41,733
- We know.
- You're so smart!

170
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:43,858
- Yes.
- Oh.

171
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,942
I think you made friends, Kathy.

172
00:15:47,025 --> 00:15:48,400
Shh!

173
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:00,942
So?

174
00:16:03,775 --> 00:16:06,067
So what did she say?

175
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:08,150
- What?
- What did she say?

176
00:16:08,192 --> 00:16:10,233
She didn't say anything.

177
00:16:10,317 --> 00:16:13,025
Are you trying to tell me something?

178
00:16:13,108 --> 00:16:15,525
It's about the bike.

179
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:18,567
- The bike?
- Mmm. The bike.

180
00:16:18,692 --> 00:16:22,650
Oh... I-I cannot give...
give Gene a bike.

181
00:16:22,775 --> 00:16:25,608
- Is this his idea?
- It is not.

182
00:16:25,733 --> 00:16:27,817
- Gene?
- Yeah?

183
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:30,275
Did you ask them to come over?

184
00:16:30,358 --> 00:16:31,775
No.

185
00:16:31,858 --> 00:16:35,317
No, he doesn't
know anything, Selma. Frankly.

186
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,317
- Why? Have I done something?
- No.

187
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,358
I haven't got the money.

188
00:16:41,525 --> 00:16:45,150
I'm almost the only kid in class
who doesn't have a bike.

189
00:16:45,233 --> 00:16:48,067
I even know a boy
who's got a scooter.

190
00:16:48,192 --> 00:16:50,900
You all know I haven't got any money.

191
00:16:50,983 --> 00:16:53,192
All the extra money I've got...

192
00:16:53,233 --> 00:16:56,775
The times I save up -
I send it to Grandpa.

193
00:16:56,858 --> 00:17:00,567
Come and have a look.
Your mother is only teasing.

194
00:17:00,608 --> 00:17:02,692
Look what she's brought for you!

195
00:17:02,775 --> 00:17:04,108
It's a bike!

196
00:17:04,192 --> 00:17:07,108
- We can't accept that.
- It's not new.

197
00:17:07,233 --> 00:17:11,983
I can't give him any expensive things
- not even for his birthday.

198
00:17:12,067 --> 00:17:15,483
He's just gotta accept
I'm not that sort of mum.

199
00:17:15,525 --> 00:17:20,483
I- I-I'm just not
that kind of mother, G-Gene...

200
00:17:20,525 --> 00:17:23,775
Can't you be that kind of a mother?

201
00:17:23,858 --> 00:17:25,900
It's not exactly a scooter.

202
00:17:25,983 --> 00:17:28,400
We'll see.

203
00:17:30,067 --> 00:17:33,567
- Careful! Careful!
- Don't ride so fast!

204
00:17:35,442 --> 00:17:37,608
Gene, bring it over here.

205
00:17:41,275 --> 00:17:45,025
- He looks very happy.
- He does look happy.

206
00:17:45,108 --> 00:17:47,817
Here he comes again.
Attention!

207
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:50,108
Bring it over here.

208
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:53,025
- Mom?
- OK.

209
00:17:53,067 --> 00:17:55,192
Did you hear that?

210
00:17:55,275 --> 00:17:57,692
- Did you say OK?
- Yeah.

211
00:17:57,817 --> 00:18:00,733
- She said OK?
- Yeah.

212
00:18:00,817 --> 00:18:05,067
- But promise to go to school.
- Yes, yes.

213
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:07,567
Every day... on time.

214
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:10,775
I didn't know
you were such a good biker.

215
00:18:10,858 --> 00:18:13,150
Rust and women are the same.

216
00:18:13,233 --> 00:18:15,442
Rust and women are the same?

217
00:18:15,525 --> 00:18:17,358
Yeah, I'm just saying...

218
00:18:17,442 --> 00:18:20,067
- Your father said that.
- Yeah.

219
00:18:21,525 --> 00:18:23,650
I didn't know what it meant.

220
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:32,358
He is so kind. Look at me...

221
00:18:32,442 --> 00:18:35,400
He did all the work.
He's really kind.

222
00:18:37,233 --> 00:18:39,400
Thank you, Jeff.

223
00:18:39,525 --> 00:18:40,983
You're welcome.

224
00:18:48,108 --> 00:18:49,858
Come in.

225
00:18:50,733 --> 00:18:52,483
Something up, Bill?

226
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:56,567
No. I just couldn't sleep,
that's all.

227
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:06,275
I have no money.

228
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,317
All the money that I inherited is...
It's gone.

229
00:19:14,775 --> 00:19:16,733
And Linda...

230
00:19:18,608 --> 00:19:20,567
Ah, Linda.

231
00:19:21,525 --> 00:19:23,483
She just spends and spends.

232
00:19:27,025 --> 00:19:29,775
And my salary is nowhere near enough.

233
00:19:30,942 --> 00:19:33,733
I can't say no to her.

234
00:19:33,817 --> 00:19:37,150
The bank is going to repossess
the house...

235
00:19:38,858 --> 00:19:42,692
because I'm so far behind
on the payments.

236
00:19:42,733 --> 00:19:45,525
And I'm going to lose Linda.

237
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:47,608
I know it.

238
00:19:48,233 --> 00:19:50,150
I know I am.

239
00:19:53,608 --> 00:19:55,817
She loves you, Bill.

240
00:20:00,817 --> 00:20:02,525
Ah, don't cry.

241
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:11,067
I shouldn't have told you.

242
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:14,108
- Don't worry. It's OK.
- I shouldn't have.

243
00:20:14,233 --> 00:20:16,942
No, I think you've got...
enough stuff...

244
00:20:17,025 --> 00:20:20,567
Would it make you feel better
if I told you a secret?

245
00:20:20,692 --> 00:20:22,608
What could you tell me?

246
00:20:28,983 --> 00:20:30,983
I'm going blind.

247
00:20:37,733 --> 00:20:41,442
Not yet, but... soon.

248
00:20:44,525 --> 00:20:46,733
Maybe sometime this year.

249
00:20:56,108 --> 00:20:58,108
Blind?

250
00:21:02,108 --> 00:21:04,983
It's not as bad as it sounds.

251
00:21:06,692 --> 00:21:08,650
It's a...

252
00:21:09,275 --> 00:21:11,275
It's a family thing.

253
00:21:15,067 --> 00:21:18,483
- But blind?
- I've always known it.

254
00:21:18,567 --> 00:21:22,150
From... from...
I was a little girl, I knew.

255
00:21:27,442 --> 00:21:29,442
And you're OK?

256
00:21:30,442 --> 00:21:32,650
Well, I came to America,

257
00:21:32,733 --> 00:21:37,983
because in America they can give
Gene an operation, you know?

258
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:40,483
Gene?

259
00:21:40,608 --> 00:21:43,025
But, he doesn't know about it.

260
00:21:44,525 --> 00:21:48,692
You mustn't tell him
because then it could get worse.

261
00:21:48,817 --> 00:21:52,983
I just have to save up money,
you know. Enough money to...

262
00:21:54,067 --> 00:21:56,025
Oh, I almost got it.

263
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:59,567
To, um... For the operation.

264
00:22:00,733 --> 00:22:04,233
They can operate on Gene
when he turns 13.

265
00:22:04,317 --> 00:22:07,275
You made up that story
about your father?

266
00:22:09,983 --> 00:22:14,442
I never had a father.
I made up his name too.

267
00:22:16,608 --> 00:22:21,525
That's why you put in all these
hours and do everything you do.

268
00:22:22,733 --> 00:22:26,067
For him? For his operation?

269
00:22:31,067 --> 00:22:34,150
Well, it is my fault... I guess.

270
00:22:35,483 --> 00:22:37,608
How is it your fault?

271
00:22:42,442 --> 00:22:47,442
Because I knew he would...
he would have bad eyes like me.

272
00:22:49,983 --> 00:22:52,775
But I had him all the same.

273
00:22:56,358 --> 00:22:58,317
You're very strong.

274
00:23:00,233 --> 00:23:02,233
I'm not strong.

275
00:23:02,942 --> 00:23:06,942
I've got little games I play
when it goes really hard.

276
00:23:08,567 --> 00:23:11,275
When I'm working in the factory...

277
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:17,317
and the machines,
they make these... rhythms.

278
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:25,608
And I just start dreaming
and it all becomes music.

279
00:23:25,692 --> 00:23:28,275
- You like movies, don't you?
- I love them.

280
00:23:28,358 --> 00:23:31,608
- Yeah?
- I just love the musicals.

281
00:23:31,692 --> 00:23:35,067
- When they're all tap-dancing?
- All of them tap-dancing.

282
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:37,733
All of them in those huge long lines.

283
00:23:37,817 --> 00:23:40,942
I... Wouldn't you like
to be in that line?

284
00:23:42,233 --> 00:23:44,067
- Yeah.
- Just kicking your feet.

285
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:45,733
Yeah.

286
00:23:45,817 --> 00:23:50,483
When they're like spiralling up
the huge enormous wedding cakes.

287
00:23:50,525 --> 00:23:52,650
- Yeah, yeah.
- To the top?

288
00:23:52,775 --> 00:23:55,733
Isn't it annoying when they
do the last song?

289
00:23:55,817 --> 00:23:57,108
Why?

290
00:23:57,192 --> 00:23:59,400
You know when it goes really big

291
00:23:59,525 --> 00:24:02,858
and the camera goes, like,
out of the roof

292
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:05,692
and you just know it's going to end.

293
00:24:05,733 --> 00:24:08,608
I hate that. I really hate that.

294
00:24:08,692 --> 00:24:12,733
I used to cheat when I was
a little girl in Czechoslovakia.

295
00:24:12,858 --> 00:24:18,525
I would leave the cinema just
after the next to last song.

296
00:24:18,608 --> 00:24:21,567
And the film
would just go on forever.

297
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,650
- It's lovely, isn't it?
- It is lovely.

298
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:32,067
- Selma?
- Yeah?

299
00:24:32,483 --> 00:24:35,192
Thank you for telling me your secret.

300
00:24:37,025 --> 00:24:39,275
Thanks for telling me yours.

301
00:24:41,025 --> 00:24:42,733
Mum's the word, right?

302
00:24:42,775 --> 00:24:44,442
Mum?

303
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:48,483
- We don't tell anybody.
- Oh, yes.

304
00:24:49,567 --> 00:24:51,608
I won't tell anyone.

305
00:24:51,733 --> 00:24:53,692
Good night.

306
00:25:13,608 --> 00:25:15,025
Thank you.

307
00:25:15,067 --> 00:25:17,358
So, can I get you another?

308
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,150
Yeah, sure.

309
00:25:19,233 --> 00:25:23,192
- How about a big one?
- How many is there in a big one?

310
00:25:23,275 --> 00:25:25,192
Ten thousand.

311
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:27,608
I'll have a big one.

312
00:25:31,608 --> 00:25:34,358
What's this guy's name again?

313
00:25:34,775 --> 00:25:36,233
Who?

314
00:25:36,317 --> 00:25:40,275
The old man - the guy we're
carding these pins for?

315
00:25:41,775 --> 00:25:46,733
Her father? I know. Oldrich, right?

316
00:25:46,775 --> 00:25:48,192
Yeah.

317
00:25:48,233 --> 00:25:52,775
Oldrich Novy.
He used to dance in Prague.

318
00:25:52,858 --> 00:25:56,067
You commies make a big deal
out of sharing everything.

319
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:59,775
Yeah, it's a good thing.

320
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,817
What are you doing here,

321
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:05,650
if Czechoslovakia is so much
better than the US of A?

322
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:43,858
No, Selma, no!

323
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:46,025
There are two plates.

324
00:26:48,442 --> 00:26:50,692
It's all right.

325
00:26:53,692 --> 00:26:57,608
You know what happens when you put
two plates in, don't you?

326
00:26:59,692 --> 00:27:01,650
Well, she didn't. It didn't..

327
00:27:01,733 --> 00:27:03,692
You destroy the tool!

328
00:27:05,108 --> 00:27:08,608
Takes a whole day to mend.
Never two plates, Selma!

329
00:27:08,775 --> 00:27:12,233
You cheated the doctor.
You shouldn't be working here.

330
00:27:12,317 --> 00:27:14,817
How dare you! How much can you see?

331
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:17,608
We could do it with our eyes closed.

332
00:27:17,692 --> 00:27:19,025
No.

333
00:27:19,108 --> 00:27:21,525
It's just because I was daydreaming.

334
00:27:21,608 --> 00:27:24,483
Daydreaming? Dreaming about what?

335
00:27:24,525 --> 00:27:28,150
- I just hear music.
- Come on, Selma. Music?

336
00:27:28,233 --> 00:27:32,025
You could cut off your hand.
You have to watch out.

337
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:34,358
Promise me you'll stay awake.

338
00:27:35,275 --> 00:27:37,608
I promise I will stop daydreaming.

339
00:27:37,692 --> 00:27:40,192
No, you're not really,
you repeat but...

340
00:27:40,275 --> 00:27:43,025
I don't know why I bother that much.

341
00:27:44,275 --> 00:27:46,233
Hi, Selma.

342
00:27:47,192 --> 00:27:50,525
If you're not going with Kathy
can I give you a lift?

343
00:27:50,608 --> 00:27:54,692
I don't want a boyfriend.
I- I told you.

344
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:59,442
You're a really nice guy,
Jeff, but...

345
00:27:59,567 --> 00:28:02,567
I just don't have time
for a boyfriend.

346
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:04,567
Not right now.

347
00:28:05,858 --> 00:28:07,900
I know.

348
00:28:07,942 --> 00:28:11,692
If I wanted a boyfriend,
it would be you, Jeff.

349
00:28:11,775 --> 00:28:14,233
I just don't want one right now.

350
00:28:20,817 --> 00:28:25,025
No problem, you know - on the
back - to have the bike there.

351
00:28:25,108 --> 00:28:26,858
Yeah.

352
00:28:32,108 --> 00:28:33,567
Bye, Jeff.

353
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:35,858
I don't think it's very safe,

354
00:28:35,942 --> 00:28:38,942
riding the bike wearing glasses
and all.

355
00:28:39,025 --> 00:28:41,483
- Selma?
- Bye, Jeff.

356
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,817
Are you OK?

357
00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:54,567
Yeah, I'm fine.

358
00:28:55,358 --> 00:28:57,858
- Hi, Selma.
- Hi, Bill.

359
00:28:57,942 --> 00:29:00,650
- Heading home?
- Oh, yes.

360
00:29:00,692 --> 00:29:02,692
Wanna throw that in the back?

361
00:29:02,733 --> 00:29:04,858
That would be lovely. Yes, please.

362
00:29:04,942 --> 00:29:07,817
- Hi, Jeff.
- Hey, did you see the truck?

363
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:09,233
No.

364
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:12,567
Like, driving like crazy.

365
00:29:13,858 --> 00:29:17,358
- He what?
- He was driving like crazy.

366
00:29:21,858 --> 00:29:23,817
Getting dirty.

367
00:29:26,817 --> 00:29:28,483
Thank you.

368
00:29:28,525 --> 00:29:32,650
- Bye, Jeff.
- Bye. Thank you, Bill.

369
00:29:35,775 --> 00:29:37,692
- OK?
- OK.

370
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:47,442
If I could make the next payment,
I'd have a bit more time.

371
00:29:47,477 --> 00:29:49,067
Yeah.

372
00:29:49,942 --> 00:29:52,983
All I need is a loan.

373
00:29:56,817 --> 00:29:58,900
Just be a month.

374
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:02,650
This money's Gene's.

375
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:08,317
- I'm sorry, Bill.
- I shouldn't have asked.

376
00:30:08,358 --> 00:30:10,858
Don't worry,
there's no harm in asking.

377
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:14,692
No, I shouldn't have asked.
Linda wants new couches.

378
00:30:16,275 --> 00:30:18,025
Huh.

379
00:30:21,317 --> 00:30:23,275
I could always shoot myself.

380
00:30:24,983 --> 00:30:27,567
You mustn't say things like that.

381
00:30:29,067 --> 00:30:31,692
It'd just... make things easier.

382
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,817
- You know that, Bill?
- No, Selma...

383
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:39,025
- You mustn't say those things.
- I'm kidding.

384
00:30:45,525 --> 00:30:49,733
Hi, Selma. Come on in. Hi, Gene.

385
00:30:49,858 --> 00:30:52,275
- Good morning.
- Hi.

386
00:31:01,858 --> 00:31:05,817
- How are you?
- Fine, thank you.

387
00:31:10,858 --> 00:31:14,358
- Can I see the gun?
- Yeah, go on.

388
00:31:16,525 --> 00:31:20,150
- He's got a gun?
- Sure, he's a police officer.

389
00:31:20,233 --> 00:31:23,733
Just didn't know he'd keep
it here, in the house.

390
00:31:23,858 --> 00:31:27,900
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Keeps it in his desk.

391
00:31:36,983 --> 00:31:39,025
Maybe I should pay more rent.

392
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:42,108
It's been the same
since I've been here.

393
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:44,317
No, Selma. I won't hear it.

394
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:48,108
You keep your money,
you need it more than we do.

395
00:32:35,442 --> 00:32:37,317
Two boxes?

396
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:41,275
You are going to do two boxes
at the same time now?

397
00:32:41,317 --> 00:32:43,817
- Yeah.
- Selma, ten o'clock, then?

398
00:32:43,858 --> 00:32:45,817
Yeah, ten o'clock.

399
00:32:46,983 --> 00:32:49,067
What happens at ten o'clock?

400
00:32:49,108 --> 00:32:52,025
I'm gonna do the night shift.

401
00:32:52,067 --> 00:32:56,608
The night shift? You can hardly
see enough to do your own shift.

402
00:32:56,692 --> 00:33:00,608
It suits me fine.
It's just after drama class.

403
00:33:00,733 --> 00:33:03,150
You are going to do that too?

404
00:33:04,608 --> 00:33:07,900
I've had my fill of you.
Do what you want.

405
00:33:07,942 --> 00:33:11,275
Go ahead! Break your neck.
You do your night shift.

406
00:33:11,358 --> 00:33:14,525
But don't think
I'm going to come rescue you.

407
00:33:21,025 --> 00:33:23,025
Selma.

408
00:33:24,525 --> 00:33:26,900
Kathy split already.

409
00:33:27,025 --> 00:33:30,858
I'm not looking for Kathy.
I was looking for you.

410
00:33:32,317 --> 00:33:35,400
Just have to go to a drama rehearsal.

411
00:33:35,483 --> 00:33:37,733
What do you say?

412
00:33:37,775 --> 00:33:41,275
You always ride your bike.
You have it over there.

413
00:33:41,317 --> 00:33:45,608
I... I left it at home. I thought
it would be quicker if I walk.

414
00:33:46,192 --> 00:33:48,025
How do you reckon that?

415
00:33:48,108 --> 00:33:51,525
I'd just walk along
the railroad tracks.

416
00:33:52,650 --> 00:33:55,775
It's, a... short cut.

417
00:34:14,442 --> 00:34:17,400
I don't understand, in musicals...

418
00:34:17,442 --> 00:34:21,567
why do they start to sing
and dance all of a sudden?

419
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:26,817
I mean, I don't suddenly start
to sing and dance.

420
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,733
No.

421
00:34:30,692 --> 00:34:33,317
You're right, Jeff. You don't.

422
00:34:33,358 --> 00:34:37,525
The last thing on the list
is the bake sale.

423
00:34:37,608 --> 00:34:39,567
Two Sundays away.

424
00:34:41,067 --> 00:34:43,733
- Hi, Selma. Come on in.
- Hi.

425
00:34:43,817 --> 00:34:46,192
I'm gonna introduce you
to your understudy.

426
00:34:46,275 --> 00:34:48,858
- My... my understudy?
- Yeah.

427
00:34:48,942 --> 00:34:53,608
This girl, Suzan, whom Boris knows.
She's a good singer and dancer.

428
00:34:53,692 --> 00:34:55,692
She'll learn your part too.

429
00:34:55,817 --> 00:35:01,442
Because, say you get a cold
and... you can't do it...

430
00:35:01,483 --> 00:35:04,858
then the show
doesn't have to stop. OK?

431
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:08,817
Suzan - Selma. Selma - Suzan.

432
00:35:08,858 --> 00:35:12,567
Ah... Could you take off
your glasses?

433
00:35:18,608 --> 00:35:21,567
I think we'll do the part
without glasses.

434
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:24,942
Next Sunday you will see both Marias.

435
00:35:25,025 --> 00:35:30,358
I mean Selma will do the role, but
I'll have you read too. All right?

436
00:35:32,108 --> 00:35:34,233
It's your first night shift, right?

437
00:35:34,317 --> 00:35:37,275
While this is being pressed,
you'll be cutting here.

438
00:35:37,733 --> 00:35:42,317
That means you'll be in charge
of two machines.

439
00:35:42,358 --> 00:35:46,067
You have to feed Sarah
over there, right?

440
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:48,067
This palette must never be empty.

441
00:35:48,192 --> 00:35:52,108
- Is it always so dark in here?
- What?

442
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:54,942
It's exactly the same as the daytime.

443
00:35:55,025 --> 00:35:57,400
But you have to work a little faster.

444
00:35:57,483 --> 00:35:59,900
- That's what we're paid for. OK?
- Thank you.

445
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,858
Excuse me. You have to work,
you know, a little faster.

446
00:36:25,942 --> 00:36:27,775
OK.

447
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,358
What are you doing here?

448
00:36:52,442 --> 00:36:54,400
What do you think?

449
00:36:58,733 --> 00:37:02,192
I didn't put you down
for the night shift, Kathy.

450
00:37:02,275 --> 00:37:05,525
Run along, Norman.
I'm on my own time now.

451
00:37:05,608 --> 00:37:08,150
How I spend it is my own business.

452
00:37:08,233 --> 00:37:10,275
- Night, ladies!
- Good night.

453
00:37:12,442 --> 00:37:15,150
Faster. A little faster.

454
00:37:15,192 --> 00:37:17,817
I like it better when you dance.

455
00:37:17,858 --> 00:37:20,608
You should dance more, Cvalda.

456
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:22,692
I will when there is music.

457
00:38:14,233 --> 00:38:16,817
# Clatter, crash, clack

458
00:38:16,858 --> 00:38:18,525
# Racket, bang, thump

459
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:20,150
# Rattle, clang, crack

460
00:38:20,192 --> 00:38:22,525
# Thud, whack, bam...

461
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:25,067
# Clatter, crash, clack

462
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:27,108
# Racket, bang, slam

463
00:38:27,192 --> 00:38:30,692
# Rattle, clang, crack,
thud, whack, bam

464
00:38:30,775 --> 00:38:32,733
- # It's music
- Dance, dance

465
00:38:32,817 --> 00:38:35,067
- # Now dance
- Dance, dance

466
00:38:35,192 --> 00:38:39,067
# Listen, Cvalda

467
00:38:39,192 --> 00:38:43,275
# You're the dancer

468
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:47,442
# You've got the sparkle

469
00:38:47,483 --> 00:38:51,983
# In your eyes

470
00:38:52,025 --> 00:38:54,442
# Look

471
00:38:54,525 --> 00:38:56,483
# At

472
00:38:56,650 --> 00:38:58,692
# Me

473
00:38:58,775 --> 00:39:04,608
# And transcend...

474
00:39:09,067 --> 00:39:10,942
# Clatter, crash, clack

475
00:39:10,983 --> 00:39:13,067
# Racket, bang, thump

476
00:39:13,192 --> 00:39:17,483
# Rattle, clang, crash,
splash, whack, bam...

477
00:39:20,192 --> 00:39:23,317
# The clatter machines

478
00:39:23,358 --> 00:39:28,483
# They greet you and say...

479
00:39:28,817 --> 00:39:32,275
# We tap out a rhythm

480
00:39:32,358 --> 00:39:36,817
# And sweep you away

481
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:39,608
# A clatter machine

482
00:39:40,775 --> 00:39:45,067
# What a magical sound

483
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:47,858
# A room full of noises

484
00:39:49,108 --> 00:39:53,942
# That spins you around

485
00:40:07,108 --> 00:40:15,317
# Darling, Selma, look who's dancing

486
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:23,692
# Faster than a shooting star

487
00:40:25,192 --> 00:40:27,150
# Cvalda's here

488
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:31,358
# Dance... dance

489
00:40:31,483 --> 00:40:34,983
# Cvalda's here

490
00:40:36,692 --> 00:40:39,900
# Dance, dance, dance,
dance, dance, dance, dance

491
00:40:41,358 --> 00:40:45,317
# Clatter, crash, clack,
racket, bang, thump

492
00:40:45,358 --> 00:40:48,608
# Racket, clang, crack,

493
00:40:49,442 --> 00:40:53,525

494
00:40:53,567 --> 00:40:56,858
# Rattle, clang, crack,

495
00:40:56,942 --> 00:40:59,817
# The clatter machines

496
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:05,192
# They greet you and say

497
00:41:05,233 --> 00:41:08,150
# Tap out a rhythm

498
00:41:08,775 --> 00:41:13,192
# And sweep you away

499
00:41:13,275 --> 00:41:17,067
# A clatter machine

500
00:41:17,192 --> 00:41:22,067
# What a magical sound

501
00:41:22,108 --> 00:41:25,233
# A room full of noises

502
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:34,400
# That spins us around

503
00:41:34,442 --> 00:41:36,067
# That spins us... #

504
00:41:38,817 --> 00:41:41,525
Selma!
Stop it you've cut yourself!

505
00:41:41,608 --> 00:41:44,525
Get away from the machine. Henry!

506
00:41:52,067 --> 00:41:54,567
Oh, Jeff is here.

507
00:41:56,233 --> 00:41:58,692
- Hello, Jeff.
- Hi, Kathy.

508
00:41:58,733 --> 00:42:00,692
Do you live here?

509
00:42:02,275 --> 00:42:05,942
She might say yes to a ride
when it's this late.

510
00:42:06,067 --> 00:42:09,108
Maybe Kathy... wants a ride.

511
00:42:09,233 --> 00:42:11,400
No, it's all right.

512
00:42:12,608 --> 00:42:14,817
What's that on your hand?

513
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:17,483
- She cut her...
- Cut my finger.

514
00:42:17,608 --> 00:42:21,275
- It's going to be all right.
- The plates are sharp.

515
00:42:21,358 --> 00:42:23,608
- Good night.
- Careful.

516
00:43:20,733 --> 00:43:23,817
I think I found a solution
to my problem.

517
00:43:25,775 --> 00:43:28,025
That makes me really happy.

518
00:43:28,108 --> 00:43:30,692
It's nothing special.

519
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:34,608
But I've made up my mind
I'm gonna tell Linda.

520
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:42,525
I mean, after all,
she loves me, and...

521
00:43:45,775 --> 00:43:48,942
We'll just work it out together.

522
00:43:49,025 --> 00:43:52,442
That sounds like
a really good idea, Bill.

523
00:43:59,692 --> 00:44:01,858
Sorry. I'll let you get to bed.

524
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:05,483
I guess I'm kinda tired.
Thanks, Bill.

525
00:44:05,567 --> 00:44:08,483
- Good night, Selma.
- Good night, Bill.

526
00:44:18,525 --> 00:44:20,400
Bill?

527
00:45:40,525 --> 00:45:42,108
What's happening now?

528
00:46:04,067 --> 00:46:06,608
Here we go.
Selma, are you ready?

529
00:46:06,692 --> 00:46:10,983
# So long, farewell,
auf wiedersehen, goodbye

530
00:46:11,025 --> 00:46:14,358
# I hate to go
and leave this pretty sight... #

531
00:46:14,442 --> 00:46:15,858
And...

532
00:46:15,942 --> 00:46:17,858
You're on.

533
00:46:21,650 --> 00:46:24,567
Cut, cut.
Stop, stop, please.

534
00:46:25,775 --> 00:46:29,275
This is
Selma's entrance, OK? Yeah?

535
00:46:30,483 --> 00:46:32,108
OK, Paul, please.

536
00:46:32,150 --> 00:46:34,650
#.. an absurd little bird... #

537
00:46:34,733 --> 00:46:37,317
How far do you think it is?

538
00:46:37,358 --> 00:46:38,817
I don't know.

539
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:44,108
# So long, farewell,
auf wiedersehen, goodbye... #

540
00:46:44,233 --> 00:46:45,692
And...

541
00:46:48,942 --> 00:46:52,150
Kathy, what are you doing?
This is Maria's entrance.

542
00:46:52,233 --> 00:46:55,233
Yes, I'm sorry. It's my mistake.

543
00:46:55,275 --> 00:46:57,233
Please, I don't have all night.

544
00:46:57,317 --> 00:47:00,067
- Six steps.
- OK.

545
00:47:09,525 --> 00:47:10,900
Good.

546
00:47:10,983 --> 00:47:13,483
OK, I'm thinking maybe, Selma,

547
00:47:13,650 --> 00:47:17,233
you could take a little circle
around Boris on this next part.

548
00:47:17,317 --> 00:47:20,692
Unless you have something else
you want to suggest.

549
00:47:20,775 --> 00:47:22,483
I'm open.

550
00:47:23,692 --> 00:47:25,025
OK?

551
00:47:25,150 --> 00:47:27,983
- Samuel?
- Yes?

552
00:47:28,025 --> 00:47:29,900
I need to talk to you.

553
00:47:30,025 --> 00:47:33,317
If it's about the drummer,
I have been looking everywhere...

554
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:37,108
- I promised you...
- It's not about the drummer.

555
00:47:41,317 --> 00:47:45,150
- Just a quick word.
- Do you wanna go outside?

556
00:47:45,275 --> 00:47:47,275
- Yeah.
- OK.

557
00:47:47,317 --> 00:47:51,358
# And up in the nursery
an absurd little bird

558
00:47:51,442 --> 00:47:55,025
# Is popping out to say cuckoo

559
00:47:57,067 --> 00:47:59,442
I'm... I'm not gonna play Maria.

560
00:47:59,567 --> 00:48:00,942
What?

561
00:48:02,233 --> 00:48:04,442
My heart just isn't in this,

562
00:48:04,525 --> 00:48:08,733
like, I shouldn't be wasting
my time on something...

563
00:48:08,817 --> 00:48:11,775
that isn't that important, really.

564
00:48:13,733 --> 00:48:18,317
I've been watching Suzan
and she's... she's great.

565
00:48:18,442 --> 00:48:22,567
She's... she's a much better
dancer than I am.

566
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:25,983
Suzan's terrific,
I'm not denying that.

567
00:48:26,067 --> 00:48:29,150
But, you... I thought
you lived for musicals.

568
00:48:29,192 --> 00:48:32,275
So you've been pretending
the whole time?

569
00:48:32,358 --> 00:48:35,983
Yes, I've just been pretending.

570
00:48:36,067 --> 00:48:39,233
I don't know what else...
Everything's cast now.

571
00:48:39,275 --> 00:48:41,025
Yeah.

572
00:48:41,108 --> 00:48:44,900
The only part that's left
is the old nun.

573
00:48:44,942 --> 00:48:48,692
I don't think you'd want
that part. There's no dancing.

574
00:48:50,192 --> 00:48:52,150
She's quite serious, then?

575
00:48:52,275 --> 00:48:55,150
She's serious, yeah.
It's important for the part.

576
00:48:55,192 --> 00:48:59,275
And not dancing, really. No.

577
00:48:59,358 --> 00:49:02,025
I could put a little dancing
in there.

578
00:49:02,108 --> 00:49:04,317
You think so?

579
00:49:04,442 --> 00:49:07,233
I didn't have it in mind.

580
00:49:07,317 --> 00:49:09,650
You can have your tapping.

581
00:49:11,150 --> 00:49:15,233
She could be just a little
humorous once in a while.

582
00:49:15,317 --> 00:49:17,525
Even though she's a nun.

583
00:49:19,275 --> 00:49:22,317
You'll always be my perfect Maria.

584
00:49:24,650 --> 00:49:26,358
Where are all the hairpins today?

585
00:49:26,483 --> 00:49:28,400
I left them at home.

586
00:49:28,483 --> 00:49:31,025
And she won't be playing Maria.

587
00:49:31,067 --> 00:49:34,192
What will I do
if I can't bawl you out

588
00:49:34,275 --> 00:49:36,775
for learning your lines
on company time?

589
00:49:36,858 --> 00:49:40,067
One... two... three!

590
00:49:42,817 --> 00:49:45,400
What kind of a joke is that?

591
00:49:45,525 --> 00:49:49,067
- I need a word with you.
- We're talking now.

592
00:49:49,150 --> 00:49:51,817
All right. Come on.

593
00:50:00,317 --> 00:50:02,442
Please, sit down.

594
00:50:04,442 --> 00:50:06,858
We were off for the whole day.

595
00:50:06,942 --> 00:50:10,275
Everything stops when the
machine breaks, you know that.

596
00:50:11,858 --> 00:50:17,275
I- I can do my job just fine
if I stick to the day shift.

597
00:50:18,358 --> 00:50:20,775
This won't happen again.

598
00:50:21,858 --> 00:50:24,275
I- I daydream too much.

599
00:50:24,358 --> 00:50:26,900
I- I decided to quit.

600
00:50:30,983 --> 00:50:34,150
I guess, then, I forgot.

601
00:50:36,983 --> 00:50:39,983
I've been ordered
to let you go, Selma.

602
00:50:46,858 --> 00:50:51,692
You don't have to pay for the machine
you broke. I got them to agree.

603
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:53,733
Thanks, Norman.

604
00:50:57,317 --> 00:50:59,442
This is your, ah... salary.

605
00:51:02,317 --> 00:51:05,150
And you know, ah...

606
00:51:05,275 --> 00:51:08,858
maybe we can find you something
away from the machines...

607
00:51:10,275 --> 00:51:12,817
where your eyesight
wouldn't matter so much.

608
00:51:12,858 --> 00:51:16,483
- Not right away.
- That's very kind.

609
00:51:16,567 --> 00:51:19,067
But, um, I'll be OK.

610
00:51:19,150 --> 00:51:21,067
I- I really will.

611
00:51:22,067 --> 00:51:24,400
- Thanks, Norman.
- Thank you, Selma.

612
00:51:24,483 --> 00:51:26,317
Thank you.

613
00:51:42,858 --> 00:51:47,817
What is she going to do now?!
Did you ever think about that?!

614
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:53,817
Don't worry, Kathy, really.
I'm going to be fine.

615
00:51:55,442 --> 00:51:57,400
Has anybody seen Jeff today?

616
00:51:57,483 --> 00:52:01,067
He's usually here early, Selma.
But not this early.

617
00:52:01,150 --> 00:52:03,358
That's a shame.

618
00:52:11,983 --> 00:52:13,483
Selma!

619
00:52:15,942 --> 00:52:17,608
Selma.

620
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:23,483
I could give you a lift if you want.

621
00:52:24,442 --> 00:52:27,067
I- I will need a lift... later.

622
00:52:28,775 --> 00:52:32,733
I need to do something important
at, ah... three.

623
00:52:34,317 --> 00:52:37,733
You need to get your truck,
then, don't you?

624
00:52:37,817 --> 00:52:39,775
Yeah.

625
00:52:46,567 --> 00:52:49,608
Train's coming.
Get off the track, Jeff.

626
00:52:49,692 --> 00:52:52,025
You have to be careful.

627
00:52:52,067 --> 00:52:54,067
Stick to the side.

628
00:53:00,442 --> 00:53:02,400
You can't see, can you?

629
00:53:19,525 --> 00:53:21,483
What is there to see?

630
00:53:33,650 --> 00:53:36,567
# I've seen it all

631
00:53:36,650 --> 00:53:39,942
# I have seen the trees

632
00:53:40,067 --> 00:53:43,525
# I have seen the willow leaves

633
00:53:43,608 --> 00:53:46,275
# Dancing in the breeze

634
00:53:46,358 --> 00:53:51,983
# I've see a man killed
by his best friend

635
00:53:52,067 --> 00:53:58,192
# And lives that were over
before they were spent

636
00:53:58,317 --> 00:54:01,525
# I've seen what I was

637
00:54:01,567 --> 00:54:04,858
# And I know what I'll be

638
00:54:04,983 --> 00:54:11,192
# I've seen it all -
there is no more to see

639
00:54:33,192 --> 00:54:39,275
# You haven't seen elephants,
kings or Peru

640
00:54:39,358 --> 00:54:46,233
# I'm happy to say
I have better to do

641
00:54:46,275 --> 00:54:48,192
# What about China?

642
00:54:48,275 --> 00:54:52,317
# Have you seen the Great Wall?

643
00:54:52,358 --> 00:54:57,817
# All walls are great
if their roof doesn't fall

644
00:54:57,942 --> 00:55:00,983
# And the man you will marry

645
00:55:01,067 --> 00:55:04,275
# The home you will share?

646
00:55:04,858 --> 00:55:10,275
# To be honest, I really don't care

647
00:55:32,150 --> 00:55:38,858
# You've never been to Niagara Falls

648
00:55:38,942 --> 00:55:41,525
# I have seen water

649
00:55:41,608 --> 00:55:44,775
# It's water, that's all

650
00:55:44,858 --> 00:55:50,900
# The Eiffel Tower, the Empire State

651
00:55:50,983 --> 00:55:56,858
# My pulse was as high
on my very first date

652
00:55:56,942 --> 00:56:03,650
# Your grandson's hand
as he plays with your hair

653
00:56:03,685 --> 00:56:09,900
# To be honest, I really don't care

654
00:56:31,108 --> 00:56:34,275
# I've seen it all

655
00:56:34,317 --> 00:56:37,192
# I have seen the dark

656
00:56:37,317 --> 00:56:43,358
# I have seen the brightness
in one little spark

657
00:56:43,483 --> 00:56:49,608
# I have seen what I choose
and seen what I need

658
00:56:49,692 --> 00:56:56,275
# And that is enough,
to want more would be greed

659
00:56:56,358 --> 00:56:59,025
# I've seen what I was

660
00:56:59,067 --> 00:57:02,608
# And I know what I'll be

661
00:57:02,650 --> 00:57:08,692
# I've seen it all -
there is no more to see

662
00:57:18,192 --> 00:57:24,275
# You've seen it all
and all you have seen

663
00:57:24,358 --> 00:57:29,900
# You can always review
on your own little screen

664
00:57:30,692 --> 00:57:36,442
# The light and the dark,
the big and the small

665
00:57:36,525 --> 00:57:42,233
# Just keep in mind
you need no more at all

666
00:57:42,317 --> 00:57:48,983
# You've seen what you were
and know what you'll be

667
00:57:49,025 --> 00:57:54,067
# You've seen it all,
there is no more to see #

668
00:58:09,108 --> 00:58:11,067
You can't see, can you?

669
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:16,358
See you at three.

670
00:58:22,150 --> 00:58:24,150
I can see.

671
00:59:16,442 --> 00:59:18,983
Gene hasn't come back yet.

672
00:59:21,275 --> 00:59:23,483
I need to talk to Bill.

673
00:59:23,567 --> 00:59:28,525
He decided to take the day off
to go to the bank for his box.

674
00:59:29,608 --> 00:59:31,942
Is he... is he upstairs?

675
00:59:34,483 --> 00:59:37,817
I know everything, Selma.
Bill told me.

676
00:59:37,858 --> 00:59:40,317
I want you to move out.

677
00:59:44,983 --> 00:59:48,567
I don't understand. What do you know?

678
00:59:51,608 --> 00:59:53,817
That you came on to him.

679
00:59:53,942 --> 00:59:58,483
That you asked him into the trailer,
but he turned you down.

680
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:06,650
You've got nothing
to say for yourself?!

681
01:00:07,692 --> 01:00:10,733
No. I want to talk to Bill.

682
01:00:30,483 --> 01:00:32,442
Hi, Bill.

683
01:00:35,483 --> 01:00:40,858
Linda saw me go up to the, um...
up to the trailer.

684
01:00:44,275 --> 01:00:47,567
I told her it was you
who wanted to...

685
01:00:47,650 --> 01:00:51,067
That you'd... That you'd fallen
in love with me.

686
01:00:51,192 --> 01:00:54,858
I know. She told me.

687
01:00:54,942 --> 01:00:57,150
And what did you tell her?

688
01:00:57,233 --> 01:00:59,275
Nothing.

689
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:01,942
You didn't tell her I was lying?

690
01:01:02,067 --> 01:01:04,233
Mum's the word, right?

691
01:01:11,525 --> 01:01:14,525
Linda told me you went to the bank.

692
01:01:15,733 --> 01:01:19,025
I went to the bank
to ask for more time.

693
01:01:22,233 --> 01:01:26,650
But I couldn't do it
and I brought the box home instead.

694
01:01:26,733 --> 01:01:32,108
Linda always gets so proud when she
sees me sitting in here with it.

695
01:01:33,108 --> 01:01:36,942
But you've put my money in it,
haven't you?

696
01:01:39,317 --> 01:01:41,858
To make it look like it's yours.

697
01:01:50,692 --> 01:01:55,108
But it's my money, Bill.
I'm gonna have to take it.

698
01:01:55,233 --> 01:01:57,858
You can have it back.

699
01:02:00,317 --> 01:02:04,233
Y- You can...
you can have it back in a month.

700
01:02:08,942 --> 01:02:10,983
But I can't do that, Bill.

701
01:02:11,025 --> 01:02:12,525
Selma...

702
01:02:12,650 --> 01:02:18,067
I- I've decided to...
to pay the doctor this afternoon.

703
01:02:19,608 --> 01:02:23,358
I can't save up more money.
That's over now.

704
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:32,358
Gene doesn't even turn thirteen
until after Christmas.

705
01:02:32,442 --> 01:02:40,025
There was $2,026
and ten cents in the tin.

706
01:02:41,817 --> 01:02:45,150
I can't count it now,
but I trust you.

707
01:02:46,483 --> 01:02:50,942
And it's thirty dollars
I got today...

708
01:02:51,025 --> 01:02:53,025
which makes it...

709
01:02:54,192 --> 01:02:59,817
2,056... ten cents.

710
01:02:59,900 --> 01:03:01,858
It's not enough...

711
01:03:02,900 --> 01:03:04,858
but it'll have to do.

712
01:03:04,900 --> 01:03:06,983
- Selma.
- Bye, Bill.

713
01:03:07,067 --> 01:03:08,442
Selma.

714
01:03:15,108 --> 01:03:17,067
Selma, stop.

715
01:03:19,567 --> 01:03:22,108
I'm pointing my gun at you, Selma.

716
01:03:26,525 --> 01:03:28,608
I don't believe you.

717
01:03:28,692 --> 01:03:32,400
You're just trying to scare me.
I can't see a gun.

718
01:03:34,317 --> 01:03:38,608
Just feel this.
Feel this. Feel it. Feel it!

719
01:03:40,608 --> 01:03:43,150
Do you believe I have the gun?

720
01:03:43,275 --> 01:03:46,650
I believe you. But it's my money.

721
01:03:46,733 --> 01:03:50,817
No, it's my money.
It's the money I had in MY box

722
01:03:50,900 --> 01:03:53,400
and you're trying
to steal it from me.

723
01:03:53,483 --> 01:03:55,442
Selma! Selma!

724
01:03:55,525 --> 01:04:00,817
SELMA! STOP! SELMA, STOP!
LINDA! LINDA! LINDA!

725
01:04:00,900 --> 01:04:03,067
What's the matter, Bill?

726
01:04:04,067 --> 01:04:06,400
She was trying to steal our money.

727
01:04:08,025 --> 01:04:11,233
She knew I had the gun
in my drawer and she...

728
01:04:11,358 --> 01:04:13,942
Is that why you wanted him?
For the money?

729
01:04:13,977 --> 01:04:16,483
Run to the car and get my handcuffs.

730
01:04:16,608 --> 01:04:18,567
Go get the handcuffs.

731
01:04:20,275 --> 01:04:21,900
Give me the money.

732
01:04:30,025 --> 01:04:32,025
Where should I go?

733
01:04:37,900 --> 01:04:40,025
Gimme the money. Give me...

734
01:04:40,108 --> 01:04:43,442
No! No! No!

735
01:04:52,358 --> 01:04:54,358
You shot me.

736
01:04:57,150 --> 01:04:59,150
I'm gonna...

737
01:05:00,525 --> 01:05:03,525
No, no, Selma,
you did the right thing.

738
01:05:03,650 --> 01:05:06,150
I should have done it myself.

739
01:05:11,692 --> 01:05:13,692
Kill me.

740
01:05:15,942 --> 01:05:17,900
Just kill me.

741
01:05:19,442 --> 01:05:24,817
Be my friend and show some
mercy, please, and just kill me.

742
01:05:25,650 --> 01:05:27,608
You handcuffs aren't in the car.

743
01:05:27,733 --> 01:05:30,317
Show some mercy, Selma, and just...

744
01:05:35,108 --> 01:05:37,775
Linda, run. Run up to Miller's farm.

745
01:05:37,858 --> 01:05:41,025
Call the station
and tell them to hurry.

746
01:05:41,067 --> 01:05:43,733
RUN! GET UP THERE!
Go to Miller's farm!

747
01:05:47,067 --> 01:05:49,025
If you want the money...

748
01:05:53,775 --> 01:05:56,025
You're going to have to kill me.

749
01:05:56,108 --> 01:05:58,317
Don't do this to me.

750
01:06:08,275 --> 01:06:10,483
Don't do this to me.

751
01:06:12,025 --> 01:06:13,942
I'm not letting go.

752
01:06:15,567 --> 01:06:16,942
No.

753
01:06:18,525 --> 01:06:24,025
Just shoot me. Just shoot me.
Shoot me! Shoot me! Shoot me!

754
01:06:37,858 --> 01:06:42,150
Can't you just stand up
and pull the goddamn trigger!

755
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:04,775
I want to take my money.

756
01:09:26,317 --> 01:09:32,483
# Black night is falling

757
01:09:32,567 --> 01:09:39,233
# The sun is gone to bed

758
01:09:39,358 --> 01:09:46,442
# The innocent are dreaming

759
01:09:46,525 --> 01:09:52,525
# As you should, sleepyhead

760
01:09:52,608 --> 01:10:00,483
# Sleepyhead, sleepyhead

761
01:10:20,567 --> 01:10:24,275
# Does it hurt?

762
01:10:26,733 --> 01:10:29,442
# I hurt you much more

763
01:10:30,733 --> 01:10:33,483
# So don't you worry

764
01:10:39,525 --> 01:10:44,983
# I don't know what to do

765
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:51,525
# Everything just feels so wrong

766
01:10:53,150 --> 01:10:55,983
# Everything is fine

767
01:10:57,525 --> 01:10:59,442
# Just stay strong

768
01:11:00,983 --> 01:11:02,858
# Silly Selma

769
01:11:03,900 --> 01:11:05,858
# You're the one to blame

770
01:11:05,983 --> 01:11:12,941
# You just did
what you had to do

771
01:11:12,976 --> 01:11:19,900
# You just did what you had to do

772
01:11:20,025 --> 01:11:26,733
# You just did what you had to do

773
01:11:26,858 --> 01:11:34,108
# You just did what you had to do

774
01:11:35,442 --> 01:11:41,942
# The time it takes a tear to fall

775
01:11:42,025 --> 01:11:45,858
# A snake to shed its skin

776
01:11:49,025 --> 01:11:53,900
# Is all the time that's needed

777
01:11:53,935 --> 01:11:57,733
# To forgive. Forgive me

778
01:12:00,525 --> 01:12:03,525
# You are forgiven

779
01:12:05,067 --> 01:12:07,275
# Come on, hurry

780
01:12:43,775 --> 01:12:48,650
# I killed your man

781
01:12:52,942 --> 01:12:55,233
# You have to hurry up

782
01:12:56,858 --> 01:12:59,608
# I've called the police

783
01:12:59,733 --> 01:13:02,650
# They're just down the road

784
01:13:02,733 --> 01:13:06,483
# They've come for me

785
01:13:06,567 --> 01:13:09,150
# Why should I run?

786
01:13:09,275 --> 01:13:12,942
# They'll take your money

787
01:13:13,983 --> 01:13:17,317
# Run for your boy

788
01:13:18,983 --> 01:13:21,858
# Silly Selma

789
01:13:21,942 --> 01:13:24,192
# You're the one to blame

790
01:13:24,275 --> 01:13:30,525
# You just did
what you had to do

791
01:13:30,608 --> 01:13:37,400
# You just did what you had to do

792
01:13:37,817 --> 01:13:43,942
# You just did what you had to do

793
01:13:44,233 --> 01:13:51,692
# You just did what you had to do

794
01:13:56,067 --> 01:14:01,317
# The time it takes a tear to fall

795
01:14:02,358 --> 01:14:07,192
# A heart to miss a beat

796
01:14:08,692 --> 01:14:13,358
# A snake to shed its skin

797
01:14:14,442 --> 01:14:19,900
# A rose to grow a thorn

798
01:14:19,983 --> 01:14:26,567
# Is all the time that's needed

799
01:14:26,650 --> 01:14:32,358
# To forgive me

800
01:14:33,442 --> 01:14:38,858
# I am so sorry

801
01:14:41,025 --> 01:14:47,150
# I just did what I had to do

802
01:14:47,442 --> 01:14:54,775
# I just did what I had to do

803
01:14:55,067 --> 01:15:01,317
# I just did what I had to do

804
01:15:01,358 --> 01:15:08,483
# I just did what I had to do #

805
01:15:26,900 --> 01:15:28,275
Selma?

806
01:15:32,483 --> 01:15:34,275
Jeff.

807
01:15:42,067 --> 01:15:44,358
What are you doing here?

808
01:15:48,608 --> 01:15:50,858
Is it already three?

809
01:15:52,525 --> 01:15:56,275
Well, not really.
But, hell, I'm always early.

810
01:16:04,525 --> 01:16:06,817
You cut yourself again.

811
01:16:06,900 --> 01:16:09,400
There's some blood on your blouse.

812
01:16:09,525 --> 01:16:11,317
Strange.

813
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:13,983
I couldn't feel it at all.

814
01:16:49,775 --> 01:16:51,733
Selma?

815
01:16:53,067 --> 01:16:54,900
We're here now.

816
01:17:00,608 --> 01:17:02,775
By the bus stop?

817
01:17:04,775 --> 01:17:06,775
Yeah, the bus stop.

818
01:17:07,442 --> 01:17:09,317
It's over there.

819
01:17:09,358 --> 01:17:11,317
And the lake is here.

820
01:17:12,275 --> 01:17:16,192
Promise me that you won't
follow me. Promise.

821
01:17:21,358 --> 01:17:23,483
Yeah, I promise.

822
01:19:08,900 --> 01:19:12,275
I would like to pay for
the operation now.

823
01:19:13,817 --> 01:19:18,192
2,056 dollars and ten cents.

824
01:19:19,817 --> 01:19:23,608
I know it's not quite
what you told me, but...

825
01:19:24,733 --> 01:19:27,483
But it's all I could get together.

826
01:19:32,108 --> 01:19:35,233
What last name
shall I put on the receipt?

827
01:19:35,358 --> 01:19:39,525
Oh, I don't need a receipt,
I really don't.

828
01:19:39,567 --> 01:19:41,733
I have to know the name of your son

829
01:19:41,858 --> 01:19:44,442
for when he comes in
for his operation.

830
01:19:46,483 --> 01:19:48,442
Novy.

831
01:19:50,442 --> 01:19:54,608
He will come and he will say
that his name is Novy.

832
01:19:56,150 --> 01:20:00,525
And then you will know...
that he's been paid for.

833
01:20:00,608 --> 01:20:02,608
Novy?

834
01:20:02,650 --> 01:20:06,900
Like Oldrich Novy,
the tap dancer?

835
01:20:07,650 --> 01:20:09,567
It is strange, isn't it?

836
01:20:09,650 --> 01:20:12,900
He never really made it
over here, did he?

837
01:20:12,942 --> 01:20:16,358
I saw his films when I was a kid.

838
01:20:16,442 --> 01:20:20,733
He was in the first musical
I ever saw.

839
01:20:20,775 --> 01:20:22,192
Same here.

840
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:30,358
Selma?

841
01:20:44,275 --> 01:20:46,483
It's Tuesday night.

842
01:20:48,983 --> 01:20:51,108
What about your rehearsal?

843
01:20:53,275 --> 01:20:55,483
Yeah, I guess...

844
01:20:56,525 --> 01:20:58,442
You wanna go?

845
01:20:58,525 --> 01:21:00,108
Yeah.

846
01:21:00,150 --> 01:21:04,192
And maybe put your arm around her
and a little bit of...

847
01:21:05,150 --> 01:21:06,900
Hi, Selma.

848
01:21:06,983 --> 01:21:08,650
Hi, Samuel.

849
01:21:08,733 --> 01:21:12,108
We weren't sure you'd show up,
actually.

850
01:21:12,733 --> 01:21:14,817
Sure I show up.

851
01:21:17,025 --> 01:21:19,275
Nice to see you. Be right back.

852
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:20,983
OK.

853
01:21:43,817 --> 01:21:45,692
Uh...

854
01:21:45,817 --> 01:21:50,900
OK, I think you could try it
one more time for me.

855
01:21:50,983 --> 01:21:56,233
But I should... I should be going
now. Gene might wonder where I am.

856
01:21:57,733 --> 01:22:00,192
Jeff, he hasn't seen me all day.

857
01:22:00,275 --> 01:22:04,942
I think we could do your scene.
Let's do the tapping scene. OK?

858
01:22:04,983 --> 01:22:06,942
We haven't done it in weeks.

859
01:22:07,025 --> 01:22:11,817
While you're here, we might as well
take advantage of the time. Please?

860
01:22:11,858 --> 01:22:15,608
Let's do the tapping scene.
Let me have the nuns up there.

861
01:22:15,650 --> 01:22:19,192
Imagi... You do Selma's part
for her for now, all right?

862
01:22:23,775 --> 01:22:26,567
- Like it?
- Yes.

863
01:22:26,608 --> 01:22:29,400
We haven't done it for a while.

864
01:22:53,275 --> 01:22:57,817
Remember that part we did where you,
uh, you come to the convent gate?

865
01:22:57,858 --> 01:23:00,067
To say goodbye to Maria.

866
01:23:00,150 --> 01:23:02,067
I should leave, Jeff.

867
01:23:02,192 --> 01:23:05,358
- What?
- Gene is probably worried now.

868
01:23:05,400 --> 01:23:07,608
I haven't seen him all day.

869
01:23:10,983 --> 01:23:12,942
I'm sorry, Samuel, but...

870
01:23:12,983 --> 01:23:14,650
Betty, come here a second.

871
01:23:14,775 --> 01:23:17,317
The drummer you wanted, remember?

872
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:19,983
I found somebody. She's fantastic.

873
01:23:20,067 --> 01:23:24,358
She's here for the first time.
Please meet her. This is Selma.

874
01:23:24,442 --> 01:23:28,192
- Hi, Betty. You play the drums?
- Yeah.

875
01:23:28,275 --> 01:23:30,650
Tell her how long
you've been studying.

876
01:23:30,733 --> 01:23:32,275
Two years.

877
01:23:32,358 --> 01:23:36,192
She's wonderful. You've gotta
stay and enjoy this. You've...

878
01:23:36,233 --> 01:23:39,400
I have an idea. Let's do the finale.

879
01:23:39,442 --> 01:23:42,275
I just remembered,
you hate finales.

880
01:23:42,358 --> 01:23:45,025
No finale. I've a better idea.

881
01:23:45,608 --> 01:23:47,942
"Climb Every Mountain", part one.

882
01:23:59,317 --> 01:24:02,483
# Climb every mountain

883
01:24:02,567 --> 01:24:04,692
# Ford every stream

884
01:24:04,775 --> 01:24:06,525
Like Indians!

885
01:24:06,608 --> 01:24:10,567
# Follow every rainbow

886
01:24:10,650 --> 01:24:13,400
# Till you find your dream #

887
01:24:15,233 --> 01:24:19,817
# Why do I love it so much?

888
01:24:22,192 --> 01:24:29,567
# What kind of magic is this?

889
01:24:35,025 --> 01:24:41,067
# How come I can't help adore it?

890
01:24:43,400 --> 01:24:48,483
# It's just another musical

891
01:24:51,817 --> 01:24:54,942
# No one minds at all

892
01:24:55,067 --> 01:24:57,817
# If I'm having a ball

893
01:24:57,858 --> 01:25:00,948
# Cos this is a musical

894
01:25:00,983 --> 01:25:08,192
# And there's always someone
to catch me

895
01:25:08,317 --> 01:25:14,650
# There's always someone to catch me

896
01:25:14,900 --> 01:25:21,483
# There's always someone to catch me

897
01:25:21,942 --> 01:25:27,358
# There's always someone to catch me

898
01:25:28,067 --> 01:25:30,025
# When you fall #

899
01:25:44,692 --> 01:25:46,692
The State will show...

900
01:25:46,733 --> 01:25:50,483
that the defendant has not only
perpetrated the most callous

901
01:25:50,567 --> 01:25:53,900
and well-planned homicide
in recent memory,

902
01:25:55,108 --> 01:25:59,608
but is also a fundamentally
selfish individual

903
01:26:00,775 --> 01:26:03,858
who cynically hides
behind a handicap,

904
01:26:03,942 --> 01:26:07,858
devoid of sympathy for anybody
but herself.

905
01:26:09,358 --> 01:26:11,942
This woman found trust
and friendship

906
01:26:13,233 --> 01:26:15,858
when she sought refuge
in our country.

907
01:26:15,942 --> 01:26:19,567
And the evidence will show that
she has repaid such kindness

908
01:26:19,692 --> 01:26:22,442
with betrayal, robbery and murder,

909
01:26:22,567 --> 01:26:24,858
inflicted upon the VERY people

910
01:26:24,900 --> 01:26:28,275
who opened their homes
and hearts to her.

911
01:26:29,817 --> 01:26:32,067
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

912
01:26:32,108 --> 01:26:34,733
the evidence will prove
that she herself

913
01:26:34,775 --> 01:26:38,942
did not show that mercy
she will ask of us.

914
01:26:40,025 --> 01:26:42,567
Is this the bag here, Detective?

915
01:26:42,650 --> 01:26:44,442
Uh...

916
01:26:45,733 --> 01:26:49,275
Yes, the very same.
Houston's blood was all over it.

917
01:26:49,358 --> 01:26:54,650
Shortly before the homicide
I had a check-up on her vision

918
01:26:54,733 --> 01:26:59,108
and I found that she was myopic.
That's near-sighted.

919
01:26:59,150 --> 01:27:01,817
Near-sighted, but she COULD see.

920
01:27:03,483 --> 01:27:05,150
Yes.

921
01:27:05,233 --> 01:27:08,817
She said communism
was better for human beings.

922
01:27:10,692 --> 01:27:13,858
She had nothing but contempt
for our great country and...

923
01:27:13,983 --> 01:27:18,233
Apart from its musicals. She said
the American ones were better.

924
01:27:18,358 --> 01:27:20,275
So...

925
01:27:20,358 --> 01:27:23,650
The defendant preferred
Hollywood to Vladivostok.

926
01:27:24,983 --> 01:27:27,400
I suppose that's
an acknowledgement of sorts.

927
01:27:27,442 --> 01:27:30,067
She just asked many times
about the money.

928
01:27:30,150 --> 01:27:32,817
She wanted to know where it was.

929
01:27:32,900 --> 01:27:34,275
That's right.

930
01:27:34,317 --> 01:27:37,358
- She asked about the gun?
- Yes, she did.

931
01:27:37,442 --> 01:27:40,150
She wanted to know where it was kept?

932
01:27:40,192 --> 01:27:41,817
That's right.

933
01:27:41,900 --> 01:27:46,900
Bill was lying on the floor...
and he was wounded and...

934
01:27:48,483 --> 01:27:50,233
Um...

935
01:27:50,317 --> 01:27:52,858
He was pleading for his life.

936
01:27:52,900 --> 01:27:54,483
Yes.

937
01:27:54,983 --> 01:27:57,275
"I beg you. I beg you. I beg you. "

938
01:27:57,358 --> 01:28:00,817
You showed him no mercy, Selma.

939
01:28:06,150 --> 01:28:09,067
You should have no mercy either.

940
01:28:11,442 --> 01:28:14,775
Would you state your name
for the record, please.

941
01:28:17,108 --> 01:28:19,233
Selma Jezkova.

942
01:28:19,317 --> 01:28:25,858
And Bill and Linda Houston...
were your friends. Is that right?

943
01:28:29,192 --> 01:28:30,608
Yeah.

944
01:28:30,692 --> 01:28:34,442
In fact you lived in a trailer
on their property.

945
01:28:37,858 --> 01:28:39,358
Yeah.

946
01:28:39,400 --> 01:28:44,942
And didn't they also take care of
your young son when you were at work?

947
01:28:49,233 --> 01:28:50,983
Yeah.

948
01:28:52,067 --> 01:28:55,567
They bought him
a birthday present recently.

949
01:28:55,650 --> 01:28:57,608
Is that right?

950
01:29:01,525 --> 01:29:03,817
Yeah, they got him a bike.

951
01:29:05,608 --> 01:29:07,358
Right.

952
01:29:08,233 --> 01:29:11,692
Your sight was poor, you claim -

953
01:29:11,733 --> 01:29:15,192
contrary to the expert testimony
we received.

954
01:29:16,733 --> 01:29:18,740
But you saw well enough

955
01:29:18,775 --> 01:29:22,483
to inflict 34 wounds on Bill Houston.

956
01:29:24,150 --> 01:29:26,650
So why did you kill him, actually?

957
01:29:27,858 --> 01:29:30,692
If I may be so bold to ask.

958
01:29:36,317 --> 01:29:38,442
He asked me to.

959
01:29:38,775 --> 01:29:40,733
He did?

960
01:29:40,942 --> 01:29:42,900
How intriguing.

961
01:29:42,983 --> 01:29:46,358
A man with a fine career,
some wealth and a happy marriage?

962
01:29:46,442 --> 01:29:50,275
Why would this Bill Houston
ask you to kill him?

963
01:29:55,400 --> 01:29:57,483
I promised not to say.

964
01:29:57,525 --> 01:30:00,650
Oh! That clears things up
immensely

965
01:30:00,775 --> 01:30:02,817
You promised you wouldn't say.

966
01:30:02,942 --> 01:30:06,733
In that case we'll just have
to take your word for it

967
01:30:06,858 --> 01:30:09,233
that the money you stole was yours

968
01:30:09,358 --> 01:30:11,775
despite the fact that Bill
Houston's savings

969
01:30:11,900 --> 01:30:14,900
also disappeared so mysteriously
that same day.

970
01:30:14,983 --> 01:30:16,983
Just, ah...

971
01:30:17,067 --> 01:30:19,817
Just where did you get your money?

972
01:30:22,900 --> 01:30:24,900
Well...

973
01:30:26,025 --> 01:30:27,983
I'd been saving up.

974
01:30:28,858 --> 01:30:31,650
I suppose you could call it that.

975
01:30:31,775 --> 01:30:34,483
What were these savings
to be used for?

976
01:30:34,567 --> 01:30:39,192
You never bought your son so much as
a birthday present, as we've heard.

977
01:30:40,817 --> 01:30:42,567
Um...

978
01:30:43,233 --> 01:30:45,025
Yes?

979
01:30:46,275 --> 01:30:48,233
My... my father...

980
01:30:49,067 --> 01:30:51,733
in Czechoslovakia.

981
01:30:54,858 --> 01:30:56,817
Your father.

982
01:30:58,358 --> 01:31:01,108
And what, pray tell, is his name?

983
01:31:04,983 --> 01:31:07,108
My... my father is...

984
01:31:09,983 --> 01:31:11,942
Oldrich Novy.

985
01:31:12,025 --> 01:31:13,525
So...

986
01:31:13,567 --> 01:31:15,983
We're meant to believe

987
01:31:16,067 --> 01:31:20,317
that you killed Bill Houston
by inflicting 34 wounds on him

988
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:24,025
because he asked you to?

989
01:31:24,067 --> 01:31:26,317
Just as we're meant to believe

990
01:31:26,400 --> 01:31:29,400
that you were blind when you did it.

991
01:31:30,192 --> 01:31:34,733
As we're meant to believe that it
was your savings you stole from him.

992
01:31:34,775 --> 01:31:36,858
Just as we're meant to believe

993
01:31:36,942 --> 01:31:40,400
you sent all you had
to your father back home.

994
01:31:40,442 --> 01:31:43,317
A man by the name of Oldrich Novy.

995
01:31:43,400 --> 01:31:45,358
Is that right?

996
01:31:49,692 --> 01:31:51,108
Yes.

997
01:31:52,567 --> 01:31:54,983
Thank you, Miss Jezkova.

998
01:32:03,608 --> 01:32:07,942
Ladies and gentlemen, you've now
heard from the defendant's lips.

999
01:32:08,067 --> 01:32:10,150
You must believe her.

1000
01:32:10,233 --> 01:32:12,442
Just as you must believe her

1001
01:32:12,525 --> 01:32:16,817
when she claims her father's name
is Oldrich Novy.

1002
01:32:16,900 --> 01:32:18,442
Your Honour,

1003
01:32:18,483 --> 01:32:22,025
at this time the State
calls to the witness stand...

1004
01:32:23,858 --> 01:32:25,775
Oldrich Novy.

1005
01:32:35,442 --> 01:32:37,233
Please state your full name.

1006
01:32:37,275 --> 01:32:39,775
My name is Oldrich Novy.

1007
01:32:39,817 --> 01:32:43,150
And you used to live
in Czechoslovakia.

1008
01:32:43,192 --> 01:32:47,817
That is right. I live now
in California, as you know.

1009
01:32:47,942 --> 01:32:49,983
Right. That's where we found you.

1010
01:32:50,067 --> 01:32:54,358
What exactly is your relationship
to the defendant?

1011
01:32:59,317 --> 01:33:01,400
I do not know her.

1012
01:33:02,525 --> 01:33:04,483
You don't know her?

1013
01:33:04,567 --> 01:33:08,608
So... you have
not received money from her?

1014
01:33:08,733 --> 01:33:12,942
Money, that... that she says
was so dearly earned?

1015
01:33:13,608 --> 01:33:15,567
No, I have not.

1016
01:33:15,650 --> 01:33:18,650
Perhaps you're not her father, then.

1017
01:33:18,692 --> 01:33:20,692
- No, I am not.
- No.

1018
01:33:20,775 --> 01:33:24,942
Well, if this relationship
was made up by the defendant

1019
01:33:25,025 --> 01:33:29,025
then can you think of any way
she might know your name?

1020
01:33:29,108 --> 01:33:33,275
I was once well-known
in Czechoslovakia

1021
01:33:33,358 --> 01:33:35,775
because of my profession.

1022
01:33:35,858 --> 01:33:38,317
Yes, and Mr Novy,
what is your profession?

1023
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:41,650
Maybe that can give us a clue
to why -

1024
01:33:41,733 --> 01:33:44,733
why this somewhat romantic,
certainly communistic woman

1025
01:33:44,817 --> 01:33:47,650
who worships Fred Astaire,
but not his country -

1026
01:33:47,775 --> 01:33:51,650
why she might have lied
and misused your name -

1027
01:33:51,733 --> 01:33:56,067
to make everybody think all
her money was spent on a poor father

1028
01:33:56,150 --> 01:33:58,067
and not her own vanity?

1029
01:33:58,150 --> 01:34:02,483
- What do you do?
- I was an actor. I made films.

1030
01:34:02,525 --> 01:34:03,900
They were musicals.

1031
01:34:12,733 --> 01:34:18,025
# Why do I love you so much?

1032
01:34:19,942 --> 01:34:26,067
# What kind of magic is there?

1033
01:34:27,358 --> 01:34:32,525
# How come I can't help adore you?

1034
01:34:33,567 --> 01:34:38,025
# You were in a musical

1035
01:34:38,108 --> 01:34:41,317
# I didn't mind it at all

1036
01:34:41,400 --> 01:34:44,442
# That you were having a ball

1037
01:34:44,525 --> 01:34:49,442
# At my musical

1038
01:34:51,192 --> 01:34:57,442
# And I was always there to catch you

1039
01:34:57,983 --> 01:35:04,358
# You were always there to catch me

1040
01:35:04,692 --> 01:35:09,733
# You were always there to catch me

1041
01:35:11,192 --> 01:35:17,650
# You were always there to catch me

1042
01:35:17,733 --> 01:35:19,775
# When I'd fall

1043
01:35:46,900 --> 01:35:48,442
# Say it again

1044
01:35:48,483 --> 01:35:52,233
# I don't mind it at all

1045
01:35:52,525 --> 01:35:54,983
# If you're having a ball

1046
01:35:55,108 --> 01:35:59,150
# This is your musical

1047
01:35:59,192 --> 01:36:05,400
# I'll always be there to catch you

1048
01:36:05,483 --> 01:36:11,108
# You will always be there
to catch me

1049
01:36:12,400 --> 01:36:18,650
# I'll always be there to catch you

1050
01:36:18,692 --> 01:36:23,900
# You will always be there
to catch me

1051
01:36:38,817 --> 01:36:43,483
# We'll always be there
to catch you

1052
01:36:45,192 --> 01:36:49,942
# We'll always be there to catch you

1053
01:36:51,692 --> 01:36:56,275
# We'll always be there to catch you

1054
01:36:58,358 --> 01:37:03,150
# We'll always be there to catch you

1055
01:37:04,858 --> 01:37:07,025
# When I fall #

1056
01:37:08,192 --> 01:37:10,233
Will the court please rise?

1057
01:37:11,650 --> 01:37:14,608
The honourable
Judge AD Mantle presiding.

1058
01:37:25,567 --> 01:37:27,858
Have you reached a verdict?

1059
01:37:29,067 --> 01:37:31,025
Yes, Your Honour.

1060
01:37:49,275 --> 01:37:52,233
Will the defendant
please rise?

1061
01:38:01,400 --> 01:38:05,233
We, the jury, find the defendant,
Selma Jezkova,

1062
01:38:05,317 --> 01:38:07,692
guilty of murder in the first degree

1063
01:38:07,775 --> 01:38:10,275
and hereby sentence her to death.

1064
01:38:10,692 --> 01:38:13,150
Is this the verdict
of this jury?

1065
01:38:13,275 --> 01:38:16,275
You fully understand
that it must be unanimous?

1066
01:38:16,317 --> 01:38:18,483
We do, Your Honour.

1067
01:38:18,525 --> 01:38:20,983
Selma Jezkova...

1068
01:38:21,108 --> 01:38:24,983
you are hereby sentenced
to be taken from this place

1069
01:38:25,025 --> 01:38:27,692
and confined
in the state penitentiary

1070
01:38:27,733 --> 01:38:30,733
until such time
as you shall be executed

1071
01:38:30,817 --> 01:38:34,608
by being hanged by the neck,
until you are dead.

1072
01:38:34,692 --> 01:38:36,733
This court is adjourned.

1073
01:38:36,900 --> 01:38:38,817
All rise.

1074
01:38:55,317 --> 01:38:59,983
I just heard about the...
the Supreme Court decision.

1075
01:39:00,025 --> 01:39:04,358
Yeah, I... I just want to talk
practical stuff.

1076
01:39:08,775 --> 01:39:10,733
On Gene's birthday...

1077
01:39:12,942 --> 01:39:15,108
he will receive a letter.

1078
01:39:16,108 --> 01:39:20,942
And it's so important, Kathy,
that he reads it very carefully.

1079
01:39:20,983 --> 01:39:24,275
I need you to take care of that
for me.

1080
01:39:24,317 --> 01:39:28,067
Because I'm not going to be there
when he gets it.

1081
01:39:28,150 --> 01:39:32,442
He should not be afraid, because
there's nothing to be afraid of.

1082
01:39:32,525 --> 01:39:36,150
Listen, Gene wants
to see you so badly.

1083
01:39:36,233 --> 01:39:38,817
Won't you let him? Please.

1084
01:39:42,233 --> 01:39:44,650
There's nothing for him to see.

1085
01:39:46,400 --> 01:39:48,358
He's got you now, Kathy.

1086
01:39:51,608 --> 01:39:53,608
And there's one more thing.

1087
01:39:53,692 --> 01:39:55,817
He has to call himself Novy.

1088
01:39:56,192 --> 01:39:58,275
That's very important.

1089
01:39:58,358 --> 01:40:03,775
- All right. Time's up, Selma.
- I know it sounds foolish.

1090
01:40:03,817 --> 01:40:08,025
Sorry I didn't tell you before
about this, I didn't dare to

1091
01:40:08,150 --> 01:40:10,567
because they would ruin everything.

1092
01:40:10,692 --> 01:40:13,442
But why does he have to call
himself Novy?

1093
01:40:13,567 --> 01:40:15,483
Stop asking those questions, Cvalda.

1094
01:40:15,567 --> 01:40:19,692
Please, let me tell Gene hello,
from you to him.

1095
01:40:21,442 --> 01:40:23,233
No.

1096
01:40:41,525 --> 01:40:44,317
I know you love your son very much.

1097
01:40:45,150 --> 01:40:47,275
I love him very much.

1098
01:40:51,150 --> 01:40:53,692
Got a boy of my own back home.

1099
01:40:58,108 --> 01:41:00,025
You never told me that.

1100
01:41:06,067 --> 01:41:08,317
- Good night, Brenda.
- Good night.

1101
01:41:08,442 --> 01:41:11,067
Say hi to your son from me.

1102
01:41:12,858 --> 01:41:14,983
Thank you, Selma.

1103
01:42:09,400 --> 01:42:11,358
Can I help you?

1104
01:42:11,483 --> 01:42:14,567
Did you once have a patient called...

1105
01:42:14,650 --> 01:42:16,608
Jezkova?

1106
01:42:16,692 --> 01:42:18,692
Selma Jezkova?

1107
01:42:19,233 --> 01:42:23,275
Well, if it wasn't too long ago,
I can check my records.

1108
01:42:25,150 --> 01:42:28,525
Jez... Jez... Jez...

1109
01:42:28,567 --> 01:42:31,400
Sorry, there's no one here
by that name.

1110
01:42:37,108 --> 01:42:39,067
What about Novy?

1111
01:42:40,192 --> 01:42:43,650
- I have good news for you.
- What's that?

1112
01:42:43,817 --> 01:42:48,317
We found a new lawyer and he is
going to get your case reopened.

1113
01:42:48,358 --> 01:42:51,192
He says your lawyer was incompetent.

1114
01:42:52,900 --> 01:42:54,858
W- what do you mean?

1115
01:42:56,358 --> 01:42:59,400
Well, the case is going
to be reopened.

1116
01:42:59,525 --> 01:43:01,900
You won't get the death sentence.

1117
01:43:03,817 --> 01:43:07,817
- Is that true?
- Yes. New information has turned up.

1118
01:43:09,108 --> 01:43:11,067
What information?

1119
01:43:11,108 --> 01:43:15,483
We know the whole story, Selma.
Why didn't you tell us anything?

1120
01:43:15,567 --> 01:43:19,442
You know, about... about the money
for Gene's operation.

1121
01:43:21,983 --> 01:43:24,192
How did you find out?

1122
01:43:24,275 --> 01:43:26,817
Well, Jeff talked to the doctor.

1123
01:43:28,692 --> 01:43:30,733
Does... does Gene know?

1124
01:43:32,275 --> 01:43:34,858
Have you told Gene?

1125
01:43:34,942 --> 01:43:39,400
No. No, I didn't. But you've got
a much better case now.

1126
01:43:39,483 --> 01:43:41,983
That's very important, Kathy.

1127
01:43:43,775 --> 01:43:46,192
His eyes might get worse
from worrying.

1128
01:43:46,275 --> 01:43:49,025
And then the operation won't work.

1129
01:43:49,108 --> 01:43:53,692
Yes, Selma, but don't you see,
it would help you if they knew

1130
01:43:53,817 --> 01:43:58,067
that you were trying to save
your son from going blind.

1131
01:43:58,150 --> 01:44:01,358
The lawyer will come
in two weeks' time.

1132
01:44:01,442 --> 01:44:05,025
Kathy, by then... You know
they're hanging me in one week.

1133
01:44:05,150 --> 01:44:08,650
We know, but he says
you can apply for a stay.

1134
01:44:08,733 --> 01:44:11,442
Most cases get one the first time.

1135
01:44:13,650 --> 01:44:15,608
Well, you can smile.

1136
01:44:17,608 --> 01:44:21,775
- Selma?
- Yeah... It's just too much for me.

1137
01:44:24,567 --> 01:44:28,317
I thought I was strong.
I just can't take it, Kathy.

1138
01:44:28,400 --> 01:44:30,483
Apply for a stay.

1139
01:44:42,025 --> 01:44:44,192
What if they don't phone?

1140
01:44:45,900 --> 01:44:49,650
Ah, well, you'll be transferred
to the other...

1141
01:44:49,733 --> 01:44:52,483
cell block at some point tomorrow.

1142
01:44:54,608 --> 01:44:58,025
That's the cell block
where they hang people?

1143
01:45:01,150 --> 01:45:04,858
Yeah, that's where they...
spend the last day.

1144
01:45:06,483 --> 01:45:11,358
And then they do their 107 steps
that's from that room...

1145
01:45:12,400 --> 01:45:14,608
to the gallows, isn't it?

1146
01:45:16,108 --> 01:45:18,400
That's what they say, Selma, but...

1147
01:45:18,525 --> 01:45:21,650
Look, it...
You're gonna get your stay.

1148
01:45:21,775 --> 01:45:25,608
Why don't you try to think
of somethin' nice, all right?

1149
01:45:28,817 --> 01:45:31,067
It's just so quiet here.

1150
01:45:33,317 --> 01:45:36,150
What's that got to do with it, Selma?

1151
01:45:39,942 --> 01:45:43,233
You know, when I used to work
in the factory,

1152
01:45:44,775 --> 01:45:48,067
I used to dream
that I was in a musical.

1153
01:45:48,108 --> 01:45:52,525
Because in a musical
nothing dreadful ever happens.

1154
01:45:56,483 --> 01:45:58,733
But it's so quiet here.

1155
01:46:00,775 --> 01:46:03,400
Don't the prisoners march
or something?

1156
01:46:03,483 --> 01:46:06,983
March? No. No, they don't...
they don't... There's not...

1157
01:46:08,525 --> 01:46:11,775
There's not much noise
around here, Selma, I know.

1158
01:46:13,775 --> 01:46:16,525
But later they turn on the radio.

1159
01:46:16,567 --> 01:46:18,400
No, no, no. There's no...

1160
01:46:18,483 --> 01:46:22,775
They don't allow radio
in the isolation block, Selma.

1161
01:46:22,900 --> 01:46:27,233
But I've been listening
to the ventilation shaft.

1162
01:46:28,608 --> 01:46:31,942
I hear sometimes people
singing there, like...

1163
01:46:31,983 --> 01:46:34,900
hymns, or...

1164
01:46:34,983 --> 01:46:37,983
It's not against the rules
to listen, is it?

1165
01:46:39,692 --> 01:46:41,067
No.

1166
01:46:41,150 --> 01:46:43,817
I wonder if...

1167
01:46:43,900 --> 01:46:47,608
if maybe you're hearing the singing
coming from the chapel.

1168
01:46:47,650 --> 01:46:49,233
Yeah?

1169
01:46:51,192 --> 01:46:54,567
- Maybe you'll even get a sermon.
- Yeah?

1170
01:48:15,775 --> 01:48:23,317
# Raindrops... and roses

1171
01:48:24,525 --> 01:48:30,192
# And whiskers on kittens... #

1172
01:48:38,608 --> 01:48:45,608
# Raindrops and roses
and whiskers on kittens... #

1173
01:48:52,150 --> 01:48:58,317
# Bright copper kettles
and warm woollen mittens

1174
01:48:58,358 --> 01:49:03,817
# Brown paper packages
tied up with string... #

1175
01:49:11,817 --> 01:49:17,775
# These are the few
of my favourite things... #

1176
01:49:31,983 --> 01:49:37,608
# Cream-coloured ponies

1177
01:49:38,650 --> 01:49:44,067
# And crisp apple strudels

1178
01:49:45,817 --> 01:49:50,608
# Doorbells and sleigh bells and...

1179
01:49:52,233 --> 01:49:55,358
# Schnitzel with noodles

1180
01:49:57,650 --> 01:50:02,608
# Wild geese that fly
with the moon on their... wings

1181
01:50:03,942 --> 01:50:08,192
# These are the few
of my favourite things

1182
01:50:08,275 --> 01:50:10,067
# When the bee stings

1183
01:50:10,192 --> 01:50:12,192
# When the dog bites

1184
01:50:12,317 --> 01:50:16,525
# When I'm feeling bad

1185
01:50:16,567 --> 01:50:24,108
# I simply remember
my favourite things

1186
01:50:24,192 --> 01:50:32,525
# And then I don't feel so sad #

1187
01:50:38,567 --> 01:50:40,025
Selma.

1188
01:50:41,150 --> 01:50:42,525
Selma.

1189
01:50:43,608 --> 01:50:45,358
You got your stay.

1190
01:50:45,483 --> 01:50:47,275
You got the stay.

1191
01:50:49,775 --> 01:50:52,317
I'm so happy for you.

1192
01:51:05,942 --> 01:51:09,192
I'm your new legal counsel.
My name is Luke, OK?

1193
01:51:09,275 --> 01:51:11,025
Hi, Luke.

1194
01:51:11,108 --> 01:51:15,733
I'm quite sure I can get
your sentence commuted.

1195
01:51:16,775 --> 01:51:21,400
All I need is a signature
stating you want the case reopened.

1196
01:51:21,483 --> 01:51:24,567
Then I can get the paperwork
ready by tomorrow.

1197
01:51:28,442 --> 01:51:32,817
There are things your other lawyer
didn't do that I'm going to do.

1198
01:51:32,942 --> 01:51:36,567
A lot of ground wasn't covered
that I'm going to cover.

1199
01:51:36,650 --> 01:51:40,900
The fact you were fighting for your
boy is something we can really milk.

1200
01:51:40,983 --> 01:51:45,608
And I have some experience
in cases like this, so...

1201
01:51:45,692 --> 01:51:47,817
That's what the attorney before said.

1202
01:51:47,900 --> 01:51:49,817
Oh, yeah.

1203
01:51:49,900 --> 01:51:53,275
You see, he was appointed
by the court.

1204
01:51:53,317 --> 01:51:57,233
And you don't get the best
legal counsel that way.

1205
01:51:57,268 --> 01:52:00,233
You were not appointed by the court.

1206
01:52:00,275 --> 01:52:01,900
I'm not, no.

1207
01:52:01,942 --> 01:52:04,192
You're gonna have to pay me.

1208
01:52:07,442 --> 01:52:10,692
- But... not to worry.
- Yeah.

1209
01:52:10,775 --> 01:52:14,858
That's been taken care of.
I made a deal with your lady friend.

1210
01:52:14,942 --> 01:52:18,483
- Deal?
- Yeah, in regard to my fee.

1211
01:52:18,525 --> 01:52:23,525
I'm going to accept the amount
that she said she could raise.

1212
01:52:32,775 --> 01:52:36,650
How much... How much was it?

1213
01:52:36,733 --> 01:52:39,733
I can tell you precisely
because I received an envelope.

1214
01:52:39,817 --> 01:52:45,733
- It was, ah... $2,000...
- $2,056 and 10 cents?

1215
01:52:45,817 --> 01:52:48,233
That's it, precisely.

1216
01:52:50,400 --> 01:52:52,900
Now... ah...

1217
01:52:53,775 --> 01:52:55,775
There's something here...

1218
01:52:55,817 --> 01:53:01,775
Uh... I'd like to...
just sort of go over our tactics.

1219
01:53:01,900 --> 01:53:04,400
I have a couple of questions
to ask you.

1220
01:53:04,525 --> 01:53:08,108
If he doesn't have the operation
next month it'll be too late!

1221
01:53:08,192 --> 01:53:10,150
He'll never be able to see!

1222
01:53:10,275 --> 01:53:12,317
This is what it's all about.

1223
01:53:12,358 --> 01:53:14,733
So he can see his grandchildren...

1224
01:53:14,775 --> 01:53:18,733
- Let me tell you...
- It's the only thing that matters!

1225
01:53:18,817 --> 01:53:21,150
You don't understand, Kathy.

1226
01:53:21,192 --> 01:53:24,567
It's plain stupidity
to waste that kind of money

1227
01:53:24,650 --> 01:53:27,567
on a blind woman in jail.

1228
01:53:27,692 --> 01:53:30,317
But he needs his mother!
No matter where!

1229
01:53:30,400 --> 01:53:32,900
You don't understand!
He needs his eyes.

1230
01:53:32,935 --> 01:53:34,567
- He needs his mother.
- NO!

1231
01:53:34,650 --> 01:53:35,942
- Yes, alive...
- NO!

1232
01:53:36,067 --> 01:53:39,233
Listen to reason for once, Selma.

1233
01:53:39,275 --> 01:53:42,900
- Selma...
- I listen to my heart.

1234
01:53:42,983 --> 01:53:48,233
I will go to the police, I will tell
them you stole the money from Bill.

1235
01:53:48,275 --> 01:53:51,275
I will say that.
I will tell them that.

1236
01:53:51,358 --> 01:53:55,317
That you stole it from Bill.
Then you'll never see it again.

1237
01:53:55,358 --> 01:53:57,567
They will be gone for good.

1238
01:53:57,692 --> 01:53:59,900
No parachute. No mother. Nothing!

1239
01:54:09,400 --> 01:54:11,608
You can have your money back.

1240
01:54:11,733 --> 01:54:13,900
I just want to make sure

1241
01:54:13,942 --> 01:54:19,067
you fully comprehend
what this means - this decision.

1242
01:54:19,108 --> 01:54:21,192
- Yeah.
- You realise what will happen?

1243
01:54:21,275 --> 01:54:25,358
Yeah. I've already
asked for no more stays.

1244
01:54:25,442 --> 01:54:29,608
Once this starts there's no
stopping it, do you understand?

1245
01:54:29,650 --> 01:54:31,483
Yeah.

1246
01:54:32,900 --> 01:54:35,150
I'm prepared.

1247
01:54:43,733 --> 01:54:46,067
Gene says thank you.

1248
01:54:49,692 --> 01:54:51,608
Thanks for what?

1249
01:54:54,650 --> 01:54:57,692
Oh, some comic book on his birthday.

1250
01:55:00,817 --> 01:55:05,442
You can't buy him presents
and say it's from me.

1251
01:55:07,025 --> 01:55:09,483
You're to stop doing that, Jeff.

1252
01:55:10,858 --> 01:55:12,817
Maybe you can just...

1253
01:55:17,317 --> 01:55:19,275
phone him.

1254
01:55:20,733 --> 01:55:22,775
Just say, you know...

1255
01:55:23,108 --> 01:55:25,067
something to him.

1256
01:55:25,150 --> 01:55:27,942
No, that's... That's not a good idea.

1257
01:55:31,650 --> 01:55:34,483
He wants to be the one...

1258
01:55:35,775 --> 01:55:38,692
who's allowed to be there
when it happens.

1259
01:55:42,192 --> 01:55:46,525
But I... And then they told him
he's too young.

1260
01:55:49,483 --> 01:55:53,025
Who put that crazy idea
in his head anyway?

1261
01:55:54,900 --> 01:55:57,400
I don't want him to be there.

1262
01:55:59,233 --> 01:56:01,525
I'd be there if you would...

1263
01:56:03,150 --> 01:56:04,692
And Kathy?

1264
01:56:10,525 --> 01:56:12,692
You know Kathy, she's...

1265
01:56:14,358 --> 01:56:16,358
She's still angry.

1266
01:56:18,233 --> 01:56:21,025
If you think you can take it...

1267
01:56:23,608 --> 01:56:25,858
I would love you to be there.

1268
01:56:32,525 --> 01:56:34,650
Don't cry, Jeff.

1269
01:56:35,067 --> 01:56:38,025
Jeff, don't worry.
It's gonna be fine.

1270
01:56:39,775 --> 01:56:41,150
Jeff?

1271
01:56:50,608 --> 01:56:52,567
Why did you have him?

1272
01:56:53,900 --> 01:56:57,317
You knew he would have
the same disease as you.

1273
01:57:05,733 --> 01:57:09,192
I just wanted
to hold a little baby...

1274
01:57:13,900 --> 01:57:15,942
in my arms.

1275
01:57:22,400 --> 01:57:24,358
I love you.

1276
01:57:54,483 --> 01:57:56,233
It's time, Selma.

1277
01:58:21,733 --> 01:58:23,525
OK?

1278
01:58:26,608 --> 01:58:28,108
OK.

1279
01:59:44,900 --> 01:59:46,983
Your meal, Jezkova.

1280
02:00:49,733 --> 02:00:51,858
Selma Jezkova.

1281
02:00:51,900 --> 02:00:53,942
It's time.

1282
02:01:11,525 --> 02:01:13,525
Please stand.

1283
02:01:14,942 --> 02:01:17,192
She can walk on her own.

1284
02:01:21,067 --> 02:01:22,733
Selma.

1285
02:01:22,775 --> 02:01:26,067
I'm afraid my legs
aren't working very well.

1286
02:01:26,192 --> 02:01:29,067
- You can do it, Selma.
- Yeah.

1287
02:01:29,150 --> 02:01:32,150
- I have a plan, OK?
- Yeah.

1288
02:01:33,358 --> 02:01:36,317
- You're gonna stand up with me.
- Yeah.

1289
02:01:36,358 --> 02:01:39,150
OK, I will make some noise.

1290
02:01:39,192 --> 02:01:41,817
It will give you
something to listen to.

1291
02:01:41,942 --> 02:01:44,275
- Yeah.
- Listen.

1292
02:01:49,817 --> 02:01:52,192
It's 107 steps.

1293
02:01:52,275 --> 02:01:55,233
- Listen to the march.
- I couldn't even do one.

1294
02:01:55,275 --> 02:01:59,233
- You can do it.
- I can't do it.

1295
02:01:59,358 --> 02:02:02,733
Now, listen Selma,
I want you to do one.

1296
02:02:02,775 --> 02:02:04,775
There - one.

1297
02:02:06,567 --> 02:02:08,108
Come on.

1298
02:02:08,192 --> 02:02:09,858
Listen.

1299
02:02:11,400 --> 02:02:12,733
Two.

1300
02:02:17,442 --> 02:02:23,858
.. five, six, seven,
eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve,

1301
02:02:24,608 --> 02:02:28,442
thirteen, fourteen,
fifteen, sixteen...

1302
02:02:32,525 --> 02:02:34,900
.. twenty-one, twenty-two,
twenty-three...

1303
02:02:36,483 --> 02:02:38,942
.. twenty-five, twenty-six,
twenty-seven,

1304
02:02:39,067 --> 02:02:41,192
twenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty...

1305
02:02:41,275 --> 02:02:44,650
# Thirty-one

1306
02:02:44,733 --> 02:02:50,150
# Thirty-five, thirty-eight

1307
02:02:51,275 --> 02:02:53,567
# Forty-two... #

1308
02:02:56,942 --> 02:03:00,483
# Forty-eight

1309
02:03:00,567 --> 02:03:04,900
# Fifty-one, fifty-four

1310
02:03:06,567 --> 02:03:09,775
# Fifty-eight

1311
02:03:11,775 --> 02:03:15,733
# Sixty-four

1312
02:03:15,817 --> 02:03:20,775
# Sixty-eight, sixty-nine

1313
02:03:21,817 --> 02:03:24,567
# Seventy-five

1314
02:03:27,317 --> 02:03:31,490
# Seventy-nine

1315
02:03:31,525 --> 02:03:37,067
# Eighty-two, eighty-six

1316
02:03:37,150 --> 02:03:43,983
# Eighty-nine, ninety-three

1317
02:03:44,108 --> 02:03:48,983
# One hundred and seven

1318
02:03:49,025 --> 02:03:53,817
# Steps #

1319
02:03:55,733 --> 02:03:56,983
One hundred and seven.

1320
02:03:57,067 --> 02:04:00,942
Selma Jezkova,
do you have any last words?

1321
02:04:05,692 --> 02:04:07,858
Very well. Proceed.

1322
02:04:16,608 --> 02:04:20,775
Selma. Selma. Selma, are you OK?

1323
02:04:23,358 --> 02:04:25,358
It's OK.

1324
02:04:29,400 --> 02:04:31,525
Come on, now.

1325
02:04:31,567 --> 02:04:33,858
- Use the board.
- No, wait. Give her a chair.

1326
02:04:33,983 --> 02:04:36,983
She can stand up,
she can stand.

1327
02:04:37,025 --> 02:04:39,150
Get her feet.

1328
02:05:00,900 --> 02:05:02,817
Straps on her hands...

1329
02:05:02,983 --> 02:05:06,775
- I'm scared. I'm so scared.
- I know.

1330
02:05:14,150 --> 02:05:16,150
On the mark.

1331
02:05:23,608 --> 02:05:26,317
No. I can't do the hood.

1332
02:05:26,442 --> 02:05:28,275
It's OK, Selma.

1333
02:05:28,358 --> 02:05:31,942
I have to breathe.
Nobody told me about the hood.

1334
02:05:31,983 --> 02:05:34,900
- It's just so you can't see...
- I can't breathe!

1335
02:05:34,983 --> 02:05:36,817
- I can't breathe!
- Look, look...

1336
02:05:36,942 --> 02:05:38,525
I can't breathe!

1337
02:05:38,650 --> 02:05:42,108
She can't breathe!

1338
02:05:42,192 --> 02:05:44,525
She can't...
I'm taking it. I'm taking it.

1339
02:05:44,608 --> 02:05:46,275
- Look...
- This is irregular.

1340
02:05:46,317 --> 02:05:48,192
I don't care. She can't see...

1341
02:05:48,233 --> 02:05:50,650
- We have regulations...
- I don't care!

1342
02:05:50,733 --> 02:05:52,733
The girl is blind for Christ's sake.

1343
02:05:52,775 --> 02:05:54,775
- I'm gonna make a call.
- Make the call.

1344
02:05:57,275 --> 02:05:58,608
Gene!

1345
02:05:58,733 --> 02:06:02,192
We have a situation here.
I'll hold for him.

1346
02:06:02,317 --> 02:06:03,817
Gene.

1347
02:06:03,858 --> 02:06:05,150
The woman is blind.

1348
02:06:05,275 --> 02:06:06,983
Gene!

1349
02:06:07,442 --> 02:06:08,817
Gene.

1350
02:06:10,400 --> 02:06:12,317
We're waiting for a call.

1351
02:06:12,400 --> 02:06:13,733
Gene.

1352
02:06:21,900 --> 02:06:25,067
Gene!

1353
02:06:27,317 --> 02:06:28,483
Gene!

1354
02:06:29,817 --> 02:06:32,942
He's just outside.
He gave me these for you.

1355
02:06:32,983 --> 02:06:35,650
So he had the operation?

1356
02:06:35,733 --> 02:06:39,650
He will see his grandchildren.
He's just outside.

1357
02:06:40,983 --> 02:06:44,192
You were right, Selma.
Listen to your heart!

1358
02:07:22,525 --> 02:07:29,067
# Dear Gene, of course you are near

1359
02:07:30,317 --> 02:07:37,608
# And now there's nothing to fear

1360
02:07:41,442 --> 02:07:44,317
# I should have known

1361
02:07:48,233 --> 02:07:52,733
# I was never alone

1362
02:07:55,692 --> 02:08:00,150
# This isn't the last song

1363
02:08:00,233 --> 02:08:04,233
# There's no violin

1364
02:08:04,275 --> 02:08:10,775
# The choir is so quiet
and no one takes a spin

1365
02:08:10,810 --> 02:08:17,442
# This is the next to last song

1366
02:08:17,483 --> 02:08:26,358
# And that's all

1367
02:08:26,442 --> 02:08:33,608
# All

1368
02:08:35,275 --> 02:08:42,442
# Remember what I have said

1369
02:08:43,483 --> 02:08:49,650
# Remember, wrap up the bread

1370
02:08:50,692 --> 02:08:57,275
# Do this, do that, make your bed

1371
02:08:58,692 --> 02:09:06,733
# This isn't the last song,
there's no violin

1372
02:09:06,817 --> 02:09:13,900
# The choir is quiet
and no one takes a spin

1373
02:09:14,942 --> 02:09:19,025
# It's the next to last song

1374
02:09:20,067 --> 02:09:22,067
# And that's a... #

1375
02:10:30,275 --> 02:10:35,858
# Train whistle, sweet clementine

1376
02:10:36,817 --> 02:10:42,525
# Blueberries, dancers in line

1377
02:10:42,942 --> 02:10:48,400
# Cobwebs, a bakery sign

1378
02:10:48,525 --> 02:10:51,317
# Ooh-ooh-ooh

1379
02:10:51,400 --> 02:10:54,817
# A sweet clementine

1380
02:10:54,900 --> 02:10:57,150
# Ooh-ooh-ooh

1381
02:10:57,275 --> 02:11:01,108
# Dancers in line

1382
02:11:01,192 --> 02:11:04,067
# Ooh-ooh-ooh

1383
02:11:04,150 --> 02:11:06,983
# If living is seeing

1384
02:11:07,108 --> 02:11:10,317
# I'm holding my breath

1385
02:11:10,400 --> 02:11:12,525
# In wonder

1386
02:11:12,650 --> 02:11:16,775
# I wonder what happens next

1387
02:11:16,858 --> 02:11:26,317
# A new world a new day to see

1388
02:11:26,400 --> 02:11:32,400
# See

1389
02:11:32,817 --> 02:11:37,858
# See

1390
02:11:40,108 --> 02:11:44,983
# I'm softly walking on air

1391
02:11:46,025 --> 02:11:51,442
# Halfway to heaven from here

1392
02:11:52,483 --> 02:11:57,025
# Sunlight unfolds in my hair

1393
02:11:58,108 --> 02:12:00,525
# Ooh-ooh-ooh

1394
02:12:00,608 --> 02:12:04,358
