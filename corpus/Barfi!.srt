1
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:45,125
The movie is about to start...

2
00:00:52,416 --> 00:00:55,957
Spread love and joy
with people all around you.

3
00:00:56,166 --> 00:00:59,790
But don't spread your
legs too far in front.

4
00:00:59,958 --> 00:01:03,499
Switch on your clockwork hearts
and tear glands.

5
00:01:03,708 --> 00:01:07,165
But switch off mobile phones
and wailing children.

6
00:01:14,916 --> 00:01:16,624
Love in today's world..

7
00:01:16,833 --> 00:01:18,624
Is like instant noodles.

8
00:01:18,625 --> 00:01:21,374
When it reaches your stomach,
it's mostly over.

9
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:24,249
Love in today's world
is born through Facebook.

10
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,999
Comes of age in backseats of cars.

11
00:01:26,208 --> 00:01:29,124
And dies in cold legal courts.

12
00:01:29,875 --> 00:01:33,457
Our story is about
a very different kind of love.

13
00:01:33,666 --> 00:01:37,165
A love filled with rainbows and dreams.

14
00:01:37,416 --> 00:01:39,165
It's not a selfish kind of love.

15
00:01:39,375 --> 00:01:40,999
It's not a messy kind of love.

16
00:01:41,208 --> 00:01:44,290
It's a love that will tickle and linger.

17
00:01:44,666 --> 00:01:52,666
The movie is about to start...

18
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,582
I'd often complain to Barfi.

19
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:55,874
That I didn't have a single
good photograph of him.

20
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,374
But his answer was
always the same.

21
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:04,832
I'll send you one before I die.

22
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:06,999
You can have that framed.

23
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:15,207
And true to his word...

24
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:18,624
Barfi fulfilled his last promise.

25
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:33,624
Since I was a child,
my idea of love was...

26
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:36,749
to live together...

27
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,415
and die together.

28
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:43,999
Just like my grandparents.

29
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:48,249
I was ten,
when my grandpa passed away.

30
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:53,124
And, a day later,
my grandma also left us.

31
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:57,790
I yearned for that kind of love.

32
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:04,332
But Barfi was miles away in Darjeeling
breathing his last.

33
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:09,749
I wasn't sure if I'd make it in time.

34
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:18,957
I had learned from Barfi...

35
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:23,499
that happiness is found
in the little things.

36
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:28,207
Even a bowl of water is enough
for ships to sail in.

37
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,581
And if you truly believe...

38
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:33,749
even paper birds can take flight.

39
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:39,332
Barfi always stayed happy.

40
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:42,124
And for some strange reason, unknowingly...

41
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:46,499
I always brought difficulties
into his life.

42
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:50,957
But he never complained...

43
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,999
neither about me...

44
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:56,707
nor about the difficulties.

45
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:56,582
Barfi!

46
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,999
In the name of the law...

47
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,082
I order you to stop!

48
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:04,415
You fools!
What are you doing down there?

49
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:05,999
He's on the roof!
Get up here now!

50
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:30,624
Barfi!

51
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:52,749
Move out of the way!

52
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,040
Inspector, there seems to be a mistake.

53
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:46,499
This isn't a mistake.
And thank you very much, Mrs. Sengupta.

54
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,860
I wouldn't have caught him,
if you hadn't filed a complaint.

55
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:50,665
Where are you taking him?

56
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:51,915
London!

57
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:54,707
Justjoking, Mrs. Sengupta.
We're taking him to Darjeeling.

58
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:55,624
Let's go.

59
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:18,540
Ma'am, sir is on the line.

60
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:20,374
He's called twice before.

61
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:31,124
Why did the cops come home?

62
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:33,707
You didn't even bother informing me.

63
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:35,374
Hello!

64
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,624
Who is Barfi?

65
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:39,207
Who the hell is he to you?

66
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:42,040
We've never had cops
in our house before...

67
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:44,332
Who is Barfi to me?

68
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,332
I had no answer to Ranjeet's question.

69
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:50,374
Shruti?

70
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:54,790
After six years of being married to Ranjeet,
why was Barfi still important to me?

71
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:57,874
Please give this to Ranjeet.

72
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:03,124
That day, I broke all ties
to help Barfi.

73
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:12,124
I guess, I could take such a
drastic step only because...

74
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:15,749
I was still as deeply in love with Barfi...

75
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:18,124
as I was the first time I met him.

76
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:22,665
That was when my dad
had to relocate to Darjeeling.

77
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:43,374
Rollup the window.
You'll catch a cold.

78
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:47,040
Who will believe she's
getting married in three months?

79
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:00,832
108...

80
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:01,957
What is it?

81
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,165
Wait, let me check.

82
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:27,790
101-4, Government Bungalows, Hill Road?

83
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:30,457
- Hillcart Road...
- Hillcart Road.

84
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:43,583
Idiot!

85
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:23,124
I don't want to talk about Barfi.

86
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:30,790
I've spent half my life running after him.

87
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:35,915
If it weren't for Barfi...

88
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:39,457
I'd have retired as
the Superintendent of Police.

89
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:43,374
But now, I sell Homeopathy pills.

90
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:46,124
Homeopathy!

91
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:54,249
That rascal Barfi!

92
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:37,040
Barfi spread love everywhere he went.

93
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:42,207
But never wanted anything in return.

94
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:46,874
No wonder he had so many well-wishers.

95
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:49,582
Barfi and I were childhood friends.

96
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,665
We had a lot of fun.

97
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:54,915
He was hearing and speech impaired.

98
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:57,624
But that didn't stop him
from being stubborn.

99
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:00,915
He had a problem, though.

100
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:03,082
He thought...

101
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:05,749
people would abandon him.

102
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:09,999
That's why he always
put his close ones through a test.

103
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:07,915
His father lovingly named him...

104
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:09,457
Murphy, after the Murphy Radio Baby.

105
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:13,415
If anyone asked him his name, he'd say...

106
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:14,790
Barfi!

107
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:35,165
Barfi.

108
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,582
You're wasting your time.

109
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:07,790
I am engaged.

110
00:22:07,708 --> 00:22:08,915
Who sent this?

111
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:24,165
Look I've put the clock back
by 15 minutes.

112
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,582
Assume that you and I never met.

113
00:22:29,083 --> 00:22:31,290
And assume I never proposed to you.

114
00:22:32,333 --> 00:22:35,874
Assume you have
made a new friend called Barfi.

115
00:22:36,375 --> 00:22:40,124
And assume this friend is helping you
plan your wedding.

116
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:41,707
How sweet!

117
00:22:42,791 --> 00:22:44,707
And now that
you've assumed all of this,

118
00:22:44,708 --> 00:22:47,457
why don't you give in with a smile
and wave.

119
00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:49,707
So cute!

120
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:57,582
I thought you told him you're engaged
so that he wouldn't bother you.

121
00:23:01,125 --> 00:23:01,885
He's very handsome.

122
00:23:02,166 --> 00:23:02,999
I know.

123
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:05,250
All the girls at the university
had a crush on him.

124
00:23:05,708 --> 00:23:06,749
Love marriage?

125
00:23:10,416 --> 00:23:10,916
What?

126
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:13,930
One fine day he walked into the library...

127
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,121
held my hand and asked me...

128
00:23:15,333 --> 00:23:16,134
"Will you marry me?"

129
00:23:16,375 --> 00:23:16,875
Then?

130
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:18,250
Then...

131
00:23:20,541 --> 00:23:22,582
I never hid anything from my mother.

132
00:23:23,583 --> 00:23:26,624
When I told her about Ranjeet...

133
00:23:26,625 --> 00:23:28,624
she only had one question.

134
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:30,874
"What does his father do?"

135
00:23:32,625 --> 00:23:34,832
After coming to Darjeeling,
I don't know why...

136
00:23:35,125 --> 00:23:38,540
I was happy to be away from Ranjeet.

137
00:24:06,083 --> 00:24:08,582
Barfi came along like a gust of wind...

138
00:24:08,875 --> 00:24:11,499
and in a blink, I was swept
away from my ordinary life...

139
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,040
I didn't realize it.

140
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:17,374
Barfi showed me how to live.

141
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:22,374
How to be adventurous.

142
00:24:23,833 --> 00:24:26,415
And the most important lesson
I learned...

143
00:24:27,125 --> 00:24:29,249
is that the biggest risk in life...

144
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:32,040
is never taking any risk at all.

145
00:24:59,041 --> 00:25:00,749
Excuse me... Inspector Dutta?

146
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,457
You scoundrel!

147
00:25:04,791 --> 00:25:06,540
Barfi the Great!

148
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,374
You think you can
run from Inspector Dutta?!

149
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:11,999
Inspector...

150
00:25:12,291 --> 00:25:13,290
Sir, please wait...

151
00:25:14,916 --> 00:25:15,874
Mrs. Sengupta...

152
00:25:16,541 --> 00:25:17,165
from Calcutta!

153
00:25:18,041 --> 00:25:19,362
Didn't take you long to get here!

154
00:25:20,291 --> 00:25:21,540
Go on... beat him up.

155
00:25:21,833 --> 00:25:23,082
Inspector, he can't talk.

156
00:25:23,083 --> 00:25:24,457
Of course!

157
00:25:24,625 --> 00:25:25,499
I know that.

158
00:25:25,708 --> 00:25:27,540
We go back a long way.

159
00:25:28,833 --> 00:25:30,124
I think there's been a mistake.

160
00:25:30,333 --> 00:25:31,665
Don't you try to teach me.

161
00:25:32,083 --> 00:25:33,082
There's been no mistake.

162
00:25:33,291 --> 00:25:34,874
And if you want to help him...

163
00:25:35,125 --> 00:25:39,790
find someone who can
communicate with him!

164
00:25:39,791 --> 00:25:43,499
Because if I file a case against him
it will be all over for him.

165
00:25:43,916 --> 00:25:45,707
But what has he done?

166
00:25:46,458 --> 00:25:47,290
What has he done?

167
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:49,499
What has he done?!

168
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,790
Look at this...

169
00:25:50,791 --> 00:25:52,707
my waist used to be 52 inches...

170
00:25:52,916 --> 00:25:53,915
and now it's 42 inches!

171
00:25:53,916 --> 00:25:55,165
And you ask me?

172
00:25:55,625 --> 00:25:56,125
Come!

173
00:25:57,541 --> 00:25:58,124
Come in.

174
00:26:01,625 --> 00:26:02,265
Take a look...

175
00:26:02,791 --> 00:26:03,624
Here's your Barfi!

176
00:26:04,041 --> 00:26:04,722
What has he done?

177
00:26:05,583 --> 00:26:08,082
He has robbed a bank,
Mrs. Sengupta.

178
00:26:08,541 --> 00:26:10,082
No, no, don't be surprised.

179
00:26:10,291 --> 00:26:11,582
The story does not end here.

180
00:26:12,208 --> 00:26:14,499
He kidnapped the granddaughter...

181
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,624
of the most respected man in Darjeeling!

182
00:26:18,875 --> 00:26:19,540
Here...

183
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:21,457
This is...

184
00:26:22,333 --> 00:26:23,499
Ms. Jhilmil Chatterjee.

185
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:25,624
Happy?

186
00:26:37,791 --> 00:26:39,915
She was only six...

187
00:26:41,583 --> 00:26:44,415
when Jhilmil's family
left her at Muskaan.

188
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,624
Pure as can be...

189
00:26:49,208 --> 00:26:50,749
and soft as a cloud.

190
00:26:51,875 --> 00:26:55,540
Even back then
Autism was considered a disease.

191
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:59,832
Her parents considered her
an embarrassment.

192
00:27:01,416 --> 00:27:02,832
I also heard that...

193
00:27:03,083 --> 00:27:07,582
her mom tried to strangle her
under the influence of alcohol.

194
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,582
And that's when her granddad
brought her to Muskaan.

195
00:27:14,458 --> 00:27:14,999
Since then...

196
00:27:15,208 --> 00:27:17,332
Muskaan was Jhilmil's home.

197
00:27:21,083 --> 00:27:22,843
You think you'll be able to
take care of her?

198
00:27:23,416 --> 00:27:25,457
How will you look after her?

199
00:27:26,458 --> 00:27:27,749
We have many servants.

200
00:27:30,041 --> 00:27:30,832
Servants!

201
00:27:31,333 --> 00:27:33,999
You see, her grandpa's health
has worsened.

202
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,999
Perhaps his last few days.

203
00:27:36,833 --> 00:27:38,957
And he insists on seeing Jhilmil.

204
00:27:39,541 --> 00:27:42,707
You know very well,
that no one can disobey his order.

205
00:27:43,083 --> 00:27:45,790
Daju, you'll need to come.

206
00:27:56,541 --> 00:27:57,540
Jhilmil...

207
00:28:37,208 --> 00:28:42,249
Of all the kids at Muskaan,
Jhilmil was closest to Daju's heart.

208
00:28:43,625 --> 00:28:44,707
And why not?

209
00:28:45,458 --> 00:28:47,124
She was such an angel.

210
00:28:47,583 --> 00:28:51,665
If Daju had his way,
he'd never let go of Jhilmil.

211
00:28:53,083 --> 00:28:54,832
An alcoholic mother...

212
00:28:55,458 --> 00:28:57,582
a gambling good-for-nothing dad.

213
00:28:58,916 --> 00:29:04,124
Moreover, Jhilmil needed
special care and attention.

214
00:30:33,958 --> 00:30:34,665
Jung Bahadur!

215
00:31:02,333 --> 00:31:03,499
Barfi.

216
00:33:06,041 --> 00:33:07,540
Please, grandpa!

217
00:33:11,541 --> 00:33:12,041
Here.

218
00:33:59,583 --> 00:34:00,499
Shruti!

219
00:36:35,875 --> 00:36:37,249
You haven't been keeping well...

220
00:36:37,458 --> 00:36:38,665
but if you could sign these papers...

221
00:36:38,666 --> 00:36:40,415
I'm not going to die...

222
00:36:41,791 --> 00:36:42,832
anytime soon.

223
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,290
Don't laugh at me!

224
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:44,040
What's his name?

225
00:41:45,583 --> 00:41:46,415
Whose name?

226
00:41:48,041 --> 00:41:48,915
Whose?

227
00:41:53,583 --> 00:41:54,540
Barfi.

228
00:42:03,625 --> 00:42:09,457
When I was your age,
I went to school here in Darjeeling.

229
00:42:10,541 --> 00:42:11,124
I know.

230
00:42:12,375 --> 00:42:14,749
Well, there's something you don't know.

231
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:16,000
What?

232
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:23,832
See that man...

233
00:42:25,291 --> 00:42:26,374
in the blue sweater?

234
00:42:26,541 --> 00:42:27,124
Yes.

235
00:42:29,125 --> 00:42:30,415
He's my friend's brother.

236
00:42:31,333 --> 00:42:33,249
He was very handsome back then.

237
00:42:34,125 --> 00:42:35,540
I was crazy about him.

238
00:42:36,958 --> 00:42:39,332
And I wanted to elope with him.

239
00:42:40,958 --> 00:42:41,458
And then?

240
00:42:43,041 --> 00:42:44,915
I was at the railway station...

241
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:46,457
with a ticket in my hand.

242
00:42:47,458 --> 00:42:48,999
And the train left the station.

243
00:42:50,125 --> 00:42:51,249
I didn't go with him.

244
00:42:54,375 --> 00:42:56,457
Since your father got transferred here...

245
00:42:57,958 --> 00:42:59,749
whenever it's possible...

246
00:43:01,041 --> 00:43:02,499
I come here.

247
00:43:03,791 --> 00:43:05,332
And look at him from a distance.

248
00:43:06,833 --> 00:43:09,415
I am scared to imagine...

249
00:43:10,416 --> 00:43:12,457
what if I had eloped with him?

250
00:43:13,708 --> 00:43:15,999
What would my life be like now?

251
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:19,707
What life would I
be able to offer you?

252
00:43:21,833 --> 00:43:23,707
The crossroads you are at right now...

253
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:25,957
I had turned away from.

254
00:43:30,958 --> 00:43:31,790
But...

255
00:43:35,916 --> 00:43:36,915
I don't love Ranjeet...

256
00:43:36,916 --> 00:43:38,749
Ranjeet is perfect for you.

257
00:43:39,833 --> 00:43:41,207
So is it only about money?

258
00:43:42,083 --> 00:43:42,957
No.

259
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:45,082
It's not about money.

260
00:43:48,041 --> 00:43:51,540
He can't say the words
you wish to hear...

261
00:43:52,958 --> 00:43:55,874
and he can't hear the words
you wish to say.

262
00:43:58,750 --> 00:44:00,915
Sometimes silence is
the language of love.

263
00:44:01,333 --> 00:44:05,915
And some day that silence will
drown out your love.

264
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:09,999
You will use your fingers to talk to him...

265
00:44:10,875 --> 00:44:13,249
but the world will point fingers at you.

266
00:44:20,083 --> 00:44:21,874
Do you really love dad?

267
00:44:25,291 --> 00:44:27,457
Who said you can only love once?

268
00:44:29,958 --> 00:44:32,457
He probably doesn't even
recognize me now.

269
00:44:58,041 --> 00:44:58,541
Here.

270
00:45:04,041 --> 00:45:06,841
Come to me the next time you need money...
and I'll teach you a lesson.

271
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:51,749
Respected Shruti's father,

272
00:45:51,958 --> 00:45:54,624
Life is a beautiful journey...

273
00:45:54,625 --> 00:45:57,290
who knows what it has
in store for us.

274
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:59,165
But I do know this.

275
00:45:59,166 --> 00:46:02,374
You love your daughter a lot.

276
00:46:02,666 --> 00:46:04,457
Your daughter loves me a lot.

277
00:46:04,458 --> 00:46:07,499
And I love your daughter a lot.

278
00:46:07,791 --> 00:46:11,540
When there's so much
love amongst us...

279
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:14,499
why don't we become a family?

280
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:15,165
Yes?

281
00:46:20,416 --> 00:46:22,874
Please get your daughter married to me.

282
00:46:23,166 --> 00:46:27,290
Our life would then be
the perfect fairy tale.

283
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:29,790
And, we'd all live happily ever after!

284
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,290
Please say yes.

285
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:34,665
Yours sincerely, Barfi.

286
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:44,582
What is it?

287
00:46:47,666 --> 00:46:48,582
Let me check.

288
00:47:08,083 --> 00:47:08,957
What is it?

289
00:47:10,458 --> 00:47:11,749
He's here for a donation.

290
00:47:12,416 --> 00:47:14,056
You see,
he's hearing and speech impaired.

291
00:47:59,041 --> 00:47:59,707
Barfi.

292
00:53:08,375 --> 00:53:08,919
Move it!

293
00:53:25,666 --> 00:53:26,290
Sit!

294
00:53:33,041 --> 00:53:33,541
Right...

295
00:53:35,125 --> 00:53:35,874
tell me.

296
00:53:45,541 --> 00:53:46,207
Jhilmil?

297
00:53:47,833 --> 00:53:49,957
He is asking about Jhilmil.

298
00:54:17,541 --> 00:54:22,040
DROP RS. 7,000 AT
THE POST OFFICE AT 11 PM.

299
00:54:32,166 --> 00:54:33,290
Who has written this?

300
00:54:35,833 --> 00:54:39,832
BRING RS. 100,000 TO
LONA KUKUR BRIDGE AT 11 PM.

301
00:54:57,416 --> 00:55:00,540
You think I'm foolish?

302
00:55:21,458 --> 00:55:22,790
Idiot!

303
00:55:24,041 --> 00:55:25,957
Tell him to start at the beginning.

304
00:55:32,916 --> 00:55:36,040
My mother passed away
giving birth to me.

305
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:39,665
- My father is a driver...
- Stop it!

306
00:55:41,833 --> 00:55:43,207
Not from that beginning.

307
00:55:46,458 --> 00:55:48,082
Start from this point on.

308
00:56:46,458 --> 00:56:51,207
After Shruti left,
Barfi became a completely different person.

309
00:56:51,916 --> 00:56:54,665
His father lost his job.

310
00:56:56,958 --> 00:57:01,124
This happened after
Jhilmil's grandpa passed away.

311
00:57:01,125 --> 00:57:02,582
Grandpa, wake up!

312
00:57:03,125 --> 00:57:09,665
Jhilmil's grandpa left
his entire wealth to her Trust Fund.

313
00:57:10,583 --> 00:57:17,040
Jhilmil's father was left to live off a
meagre monthly allowance, like the servants.

314
00:57:18,166 --> 00:57:19,874
The arguments got worse...

315
00:57:20,875 --> 00:57:28,124
and one day he got rid of all the servants,
including the old timers.

316
00:57:28,958 --> 00:57:33,124
Including Barf I's father
and Jhilmil's nanny.

317
00:57:33,833 --> 00:57:39,707
He didn't consider how Jhilmil
would survive without her nanny.

318
00:58:57,916 --> 00:58:59,332
Kidney failure...

319
00:59:00,458 --> 00:59:03,040
He needs surgery.

320
00:59:04,291 --> 00:59:06,124
Seven thousand rupees...

321
00:59:15,041 --> 00:59:16,832
Within two days...

322
00:59:17,416 --> 00:59:18,207
two days.

323
01:00:56,125 --> 01:00:56,915
Hello...

324
01:00:57,583 --> 01:00:58,374
Yes!

325
01:00:59,583 --> 01:01:00,957
Mr. Chatterjee...

326
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:02,832
Good evening, sir.

327
01:01:03,916 --> 01:01:04,790
Kidnapped?

328
01:01:06,250 --> 01:01:07,332
Your daughter?

329
01:01:08,375 --> 01:01:09,624
Are you sure?

330
01:01:36,875 --> 01:01:39,332
Who was the last to see her?

331
01:01:39,666 --> 01:01:42,415
I was reading her a bedtime story...

332
01:01:42,416 --> 01:01:46,040
If she was asleep,
how could she be kidnapped?

333
01:01:46,375 --> 01:01:48,124
For God's sake!
I received a call.

334
01:01:48,583 --> 01:01:50,665
For a ransom of 50,000 rupees!

335
01:01:50,666 --> 01:01:51,249
50,000?

336
01:01:51,250 --> 01:01:52,374
This way, please...

337
01:01:54,333 --> 01:01:55,332
Do you suspect anyone?

338
01:01:55,333 --> 01:01:57,332
I mean, do you have any enemies?

339
01:01:57,666 --> 01:01:59,290
He has several debts...

340
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:01,207
so, yes, there are enemies.

341
01:02:01,375 --> 01:02:02,332
I'm sorry.

342
01:02:02,541 --> 01:02:04,749
- Sorry, she's been drinking.
- I'm sure its one of them.

343
01:02:04,750 --> 01:02:07,665
- Please, can you stop drinking?
- I was not drinking.

344
01:02:10,375 --> 01:02:12,540
Go call the other servants.

345
01:02:12,541 --> 01:02:13,415
Take him with you.

346
01:02:15,416 --> 01:02:16,415
You tried to strangle her
when she was a child.

347
01:02:16,416 --> 01:02:17,832
Why do you have to bring that up?

348
01:02:18,125 --> 01:02:18,926
How can I forget it?

349
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:19,500
Shut up!

350
01:02:19,708 --> 01:02:20,374
You shut up!

351
01:02:54,125 --> 01:02:56,249
MR. CHATTERJEE'S DAUGHTER KIDNAPPED.

352
01:05:25,125 --> 01:05:25,790
Barfi!

353
01:05:40,625 --> 01:05:43,415
Where were you?

354
01:05:44,333 --> 01:05:45,207
Where are you going?

355
01:05:45,916 --> 01:05:46,957
Mr. Dutta!

356
01:05:47,833 --> 01:05:48,915
We are late.

357
01:06:57,375 --> 01:06:58,655
Inspector Dutta, do something!

358
01:11:35,583 --> 01:11:36,332
Barfi.

359
01:11:46,833 --> 01:11:48,040
Got to pee...

360
01:12:29,791 --> 01:12:30,957
No, don't shut the door...

361
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,165
DROP RS. 7,000 AT
THE POST OFFICE AT 11 PM.

362
01:15:27,500 --> 01:15:30,832
Who goes there?

363
01:16:46,083 --> 01:16:47,035
Open the door.

364
01:18:02,208 --> 01:18:05,499
I looked after her for 15 years,
but you...

365
01:18:05,791 --> 01:18:07,707
couldn't take care of her for 15 days!

366
01:18:07,875 --> 01:18:09,540
When did you get this letter?

367
01:18:09,916 --> 01:18:11,040
I got it this morning
in the letterbox.

368
01:18:11,250 --> 01:18:13,207
I told you
not to take her away!

369
01:18:14,125 --> 01:18:15,832
Money is all that matters to you!

370
01:18:16,500 --> 01:18:18,707
I know what's happening here.

371
01:18:18,708 --> 01:18:19,499
What are you trying to say?

372
01:18:19,708 --> 01:18:21,124
How can you talk like that?

373
01:18:21,541 --> 01:18:23,332
You don't know the facts!

374
01:18:23,833 --> 01:18:24,832
There's a cop here.

375
01:18:25,041 --> 01:18:26,290
Yet you're saying such things.

376
01:18:28,041 --> 01:18:28,832
Inspector...

377
01:18:30,375 --> 01:18:32,290
please investigate this thoroughly.

378
01:18:32,791 --> 01:18:34,790
I think Jhilmil's family is involved.

379
01:24:47,375 --> 01:24:47,957
209...

380
01:24:48,125 --> 01:24:49,832
- 210?
- 210.

381
01:24:49,833 --> 01:24:51,332
- 211?
- 211.

382
01:24:52,375 --> 01:24:53,832
What is the patient's name?

383
01:24:54,708 --> 01:24:55,832
Jung Bahadur.

384
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:23,249
Eeny Meeny Miny Moe.

385
01:26:48,416 --> 01:26:50,136
Sir, the Senior Inspector wants to see you.

386
01:26:57,041 --> 01:26:57,541
Sir...

387
01:26:58,875 --> 01:26:59,957
Sir, my wife is...

388
01:27:00,666 --> 01:27:01,166
pregnant.

389
01:27:01,291 --> 01:27:02,332
But you aren't!

390
01:27:02,625 --> 01:27:03,707
Stay here.

391
01:27:11,375 --> 01:27:12,249
Did he tell you?

392
01:27:13,708 --> 01:27:14,582
He didn't tell me.

393
01:27:16,291 --> 01:27:17,540
Did you tell him?

394
01:27:19,083 --> 01:27:20,082
I didn't tell him.

395
01:27:22,750 --> 01:27:23,707
What do we do?

396
01:27:25,083 --> 01:27:26,665
- Tell me.
- You tell me, sir.

397
01:27:28,458 --> 01:27:29,249
What do we do?

398
01:27:31,166 --> 01:27:32,124
He's already here.

399
01:27:35,875 --> 01:27:37,332
Yes, sir, he is here.

400
01:27:38,458 --> 01:27:39,374
Will you go?

401
01:27:40,166 --> 01:27:41,165
Or should I?

402
01:27:44,666 --> 01:27:45,665
There's an hour to go.

403
01:27:48,625 --> 01:27:51,290
I will continue the interrogation.

404
01:27:52,250 --> 01:27:55,290
We got two ransom notes.

405
01:27:56,666 --> 01:28:00,832
The first, for 7,000 rupees,
was written by Barfi.

406
01:28:02,958 --> 01:28:06,124
But we don't know who wrote
the second note for 100,000 rupees.

407
01:28:08,333 --> 01:28:10,915
'If your daughter's life is dear to you...

408
01:28:12,333 --> 01:28:14,374
come with 100,000 rupees to...

409
01:28:15,416 --> 01:28:18,749
Lona Kukur bridge at 11 pm.

410
01:28:19,375 --> 01:28:21,165
Otherwise the girl is dead.'

411
01:28:21,833 --> 01:28:24,540
So the Senior Inspector
and Mr. Chatterjee...

412
01:28:24,750 --> 01:28:28,040
went to the bridge at 11 pm sharp.

413
01:29:31,125 --> 01:29:35,707
All night long, many officers...

414
01:29:37,166 --> 01:29:38,999
tried to look for Jhilmil
in the lake.

415
01:29:42,208 --> 01:29:44,499
The strange thing about this case was...

416
01:29:47,916 --> 01:29:49,624
no one could identify the villain.

417
01:29:51,791 --> 01:29:54,290
If Jhilmil were to be killed...

418
01:29:55,083 --> 01:29:56,624
who would stand to gain?

419
01:29:59,375 --> 01:30:02,790
I continued with my interrogation.

420
01:30:04,125 --> 01:30:07,999
I was sure of getting a lead somewhere.

421
01:30:10,041 --> 01:30:11,249
I didn't get any leads.

422
01:30:12,916 --> 01:30:14,290
But what I did get...

423
01:30:15,625 --> 01:30:17,415
was emotionally shocking.

424
01:31:17,583 --> 01:31:19,290
You can't get away!

425
01:31:19,666 --> 01:31:21,457
Hey... wait!

426
01:32:46,958 --> 01:32:49,124
Do you want to go or not?

427
01:36:58,291 --> 01:36:58,835
Barfi...

428
01:37:23,208 --> 01:37:25,207
Barfi!

429
01:42:10,750 --> 01:42:12,707
CHATTERJEE GIRL MISSING.
KIDNAPPER ON THE RUN.

430
01:43:52,333 --> 01:43:54,249
Sorry, sir.

431
01:43:56,625 --> 01:43:58,665
The Senior Inspector wants to see you.

432
01:44:18,416 --> 01:44:19,207
Excuse me!

433
01:44:28,291 --> 01:44:29,540
Mr. Sengupta.

434
01:44:30,708 --> 01:44:31,374
Waiting.

435
01:45:00,791 --> 01:45:02,957
Once again I lost my resolve
when I saw Ranjeet.

436
01:45:05,041 --> 01:45:07,540
Once again I'd left Barfi behind.

437
01:45:12,375 --> 01:45:14,749
But destiny kept bringing me
back to him.

438
01:45:15,500 --> 01:45:16,957
Yet, I don't know why...

439
01:45:18,791 --> 01:45:21,624
I never had the courage to follow my heart.

440
01:45:23,250 --> 01:45:27,082
Perhaps that's why destiny
didn't favor me.

441
01:45:28,875 --> 01:45:31,332
Barfi could've taken Jhilmil anywhere.

442
01:45:33,125 --> 01:45:35,040
But destiny brought him to Kolkata.

443
01:45:37,500 --> 01:45:40,790
Or he came there intentionally.

444
01:45:43,125 --> 01:45:47,540
Because he knew I had moved to
Kolkata after my wedding.

445
01:48:15,041 --> 01:48:18,790
A...

446
01:48:26,291 --> 01:48:29,874
B...

447
01:48:30,166 --> 01:48:33,749
B for Barfi...

448
01:48:34,041 --> 01:48:36,040
Barfi...

449
01:48:36,041 --> 01:48:36,957
Barfi!

450
01:53:06,416 --> 01:53:10,999
I never imagined
Barfi would enter my life again.

451
01:53:12,875 --> 01:53:15,457
And when I met him
after all this time...

452
01:53:16,833 --> 01:53:19,832
I wasn'tjust meeting Barfi.

453
01:53:20,791 --> 01:53:22,249
But also the girl...

454
01:53:23,541 --> 01:53:26,082
who lost herself after
becoming Mrs. Sengupta.

455
01:55:07,958 --> 01:55:08,832
Mom once said...

456
01:55:08,833 --> 01:55:11,165
that a silence would envelope
Barfi and me.

457
01:55:11,583 --> 01:55:14,040
And that some day that
silence would drown out our love.

458
01:55:15,083 --> 01:55:19,082
But silence was all Ranjeet and I had.

459
01:55:20,125 --> 01:55:24,249
We could hear each other clearly...
but we didn't feel a thing.

460
01:55:25,041 --> 01:55:27,499
In every way we were complete...

461
01:55:27,750 --> 01:55:29,749
but our love remained incomplete.

462
01:55:31,708 --> 01:55:33,832
You could say, in some ways
Barfi was incomplete...

463
01:55:34,458 --> 01:55:36,707
but his love was complete.

464
01:59:53,250 --> 01:59:54,957
All I know is that she is from Darjeeling.

465
01:59:55,708 --> 01:59:58,108
But what about her parents?
Don't you have any other details?

466
02:00:10,625 --> 02:00:11,874
Mrs. Sengupta?

467
02:00:12,083 --> 02:00:13,499
Yes.

468
02:00:14,208 --> 02:00:16,415
Jhilmil Chatterjee's missing report?

469
02:00:16,708 --> 02:00:17,707
Yes?

470
02:00:17,916 --> 02:00:18,749
Did you report it?

471
02:00:18,750 --> 02:00:19,415
Yes.

472
02:00:41,375 --> 02:00:45,082
Jhilmil went missing three times.

473
02:00:47,416 --> 02:00:49,082
First, she was kidnapped from her home.

474
02:00:49,750 --> 02:00:53,915
The second time
Barfi took her from under our nose!

475
02:00:55,708 --> 02:00:59,874
The next six months
I didn't hear a thing.

476
02:01:01,125 --> 02:01:04,124
I assumed it was the end of the case.

477
02:01:05,875 --> 02:01:09,957
But, six months later,
Mr. Chatterjee called me...

478
02:01:10,791 --> 02:01:11,624
to his house.

479
02:01:12,541 --> 02:01:13,999
And, why did he call me?

480
02:01:15,416 --> 02:01:18,540
To give me the
100,000 rupee ransom note.

481
02:01:19,833 --> 02:01:20,874
Case reopened.

482
02:01:22,750 --> 02:01:26,707
But, even before I could get started,
I got a call from Calcutta.

483
02:01:27,750 --> 02:01:31,165
That a certain
Mrs. Sengupta in Calcutta...

484
02:01:31,166 --> 02:01:34,290
had reported Jhilmil missing.

485
02:01:35,291 --> 02:01:37,999
Jhilmil missing in Calcutta...

486
02:01:39,791 --> 02:01:41,165
and ransom note in Darjeeling.

487
02:01:41,333 --> 02:01:43,707
It made no sense.

488
02:01:44,375 --> 02:01:48,415
Just like a bad detective novel.

489
02:01:52,375 --> 02:01:52,875
Now?

490
02:01:54,458 --> 02:01:55,019
What now, sir?

491
02:01:56,250 --> 02:01:57,832
We have to tell the girl's father...

492
02:01:58,708 --> 02:02:00,332
who killed her.

493
02:02:01,333 --> 02:02:02,124
Who?

494
02:02:05,250 --> 02:02:06,540
Who is in our custody?

495
02:02:06,958 --> 02:02:07,665
Barfi.

496
02:02:08,500 --> 02:02:09,249
He killed Jhilmil.

497
02:02:10,500 --> 02:02:11,740
How could he have killed her...

498
02:02:12,541 --> 02:02:13,862
while he has been in our custody?

499
02:02:13,916 --> 02:02:17,790
You and I know that,
but Mr. Chatterjee doesn't.

500
02:02:18,875 --> 02:02:20,082
No.

501
02:02:20,500 --> 02:02:22,124
Fundamentally, this is wrong, sir.

502
02:02:22,666 --> 02:02:25,999
Fundamentally, he can
dismiss us from our jobs.

503
02:02:26,750 --> 02:02:27,832
He's very powerful.

504
02:02:28,250 --> 02:02:29,915
He can take names off school rolls.

505
02:02:29,916 --> 02:02:32,290
I don't go to school, sir.

506
02:02:32,500 --> 02:02:34,082
But your kids do.

507
02:02:34,625 --> 02:02:37,749
If you lose your job,
how will you pay the fees?

508
02:02:38,500 --> 02:02:41,499
We'll tell Chatterjee that we arrested him
after the girl died.

509
02:02:42,416 --> 02:02:45,040
He is hearing and speech impaired.
He can't argue, simple!

510
02:02:57,375 --> 02:02:58,957
Hello... Mr. Chatterjee...

511
02:03:21,791 --> 02:03:23,415
What are you looking for?

512
02:03:24,791 --> 02:03:25,999
The lawyer's number.

513
02:03:38,875 --> 02:03:41,582
Why don't you eat something...

514
02:03:45,875 --> 02:03:46,540
Shruti...

515
02:03:50,541 --> 02:03:52,707
You lied to me, mom.

516
02:03:54,875 --> 02:03:59,999
Why do you sneak out
to see that man?

517
02:04:01,875 --> 02:04:04,165
It's because you still love him.

518
02:04:06,500 --> 02:04:07,332
Don't you?

519
02:04:11,208 --> 02:04:13,290
Do you really love dad?

520
02:04:39,375 --> 02:04:41,540
Mr. Chatterjee... don't do this.

521
02:04:43,916 --> 02:04:45,999
Mr. Chatterjee, listen...

522
02:04:46,250 --> 02:04:48,082
Control yourself... please!

523
02:04:56,250 --> 02:04:57,165
I request you.

524
02:04:57,375 --> 02:04:59,207
Get a hold of yourself!

525
02:04:59,833 --> 02:05:02,832
Barfi! Don't do that.

526
02:05:45,833 --> 02:05:46,374
Hello...

527
02:05:48,500 --> 02:05:49,082
Yes.

528
02:05:59,166 --> 02:06:00,366
Okay Inspector, I'll be there.

529
02:06:07,375 --> 02:06:08,707
Do you really have to go?

530
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:15,707
Shruti...

531
02:06:18,416 --> 02:06:19,499
Then don't come back.

532
02:06:42,791 --> 02:06:43,999
Thank you, Mrs. Sengupta.

533
02:06:45,458 --> 02:06:47,624
I wasn't sure who to call.

534
02:06:49,375 --> 02:06:51,249
And I didn't think
anybody else would turn up.

535
02:06:53,333 --> 02:06:55,332
We don't know who murdered Jhilmil.

536
02:06:56,166 --> 02:06:59,207
But when asked,
the cops will say he did it.

537
02:07:00,916 --> 02:07:01,874
I'll find out...

538
02:07:03,208 --> 02:07:04,624
who the real culprit is.

539
02:07:06,125 --> 02:07:07,405
But that could take some time.

540
02:07:09,833 --> 02:07:11,665
I don't have a soft corner for him.

541
02:07:13,291 --> 02:07:15,165
But I guess you do...

542
02:07:17,375 --> 02:07:19,874
He'll get trapped, Mrs. Sengupta.

543
02:07:21,250 --> 02:07:22,582
They are a powerful family.

544
02:07:23,833 --> 02:07:25,165
Take him away.

545
02:07:26,666 --> 02:07:27,457
But...

546
02:07:29,250 --> 02:07:30,957
everybody deserves a second chance.

547
02:07:40,916 --> 02:07:42,540
Here... a ticket for Calcutta.

548
02:07:42,750 --> 02:07:43,790
Thank you!

549
02:07:47,791 --> 02:07:49,249
One more ticket, please.

550
02:11:51,250 --> 02:11:52,749
I don't know why but...

551
02:11:53,916 --> 02:11:56,749
I wasn't really concerned
about Jhilmil's disappearance.

552
02:11:57,291 --> 02:11:58,499
In fact, I was happy.

553
02:12:00,375 --> 02:12:01,999
Because, finally Barfi was mine.

554
02:12:03,750 --> 02:12:05,540
But someone who loses their love...

555
02:12:05,875 --> 02:12:09,457
and goes on with life,
who knew that better than me.

556
02:12:11,333 --> 02:12:13,665
Living with Barfi I realised that...

557
02:12:14,416 --> 02:12:15,957
I finally got my opportunity.

558
02:12:16,666 --> 02:12:18,290
But a little too late.

559
02:12:19,708 --> 02:12:21,957
There I was with Barfi...

560
02:12:22,583 --> 02:12:27,040
but Barfi was still devoted to Jhilmil.

561
02:13:56,583 --> 02:13:57,790
So, you're Barfi.

562
02:13:59,125 --> 02:14:01,624
You're here looking for Jhilmil.

563
02:14:03,208 --> 02:14:04,165
But why here?

564
02:14:05,791 --> 02:14:08,165
Jhilmil had the number of this place.

565
02:14:13,333 --> 02:14:17,040
So he thought... his last hope...

566
02:14:17,458 --> 02:14:19,290
Why would Jhilmil be here?

567
02:14:21,291 --> 02:14:22,415
It's been so long since...

568
02:14:24,416 --> 02:14:26,207
Jhilmil didn't come here.

569
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:29,540
Please leave!

570
02:14:30,041 --> 02:14:31,040
Please go away.

571
02:14:32,333 --> 02:14:33,415
Please go!

572
02:14:35,250 --> 02:14:36,540
Jhilmil is not here.

573
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:40,249
Jhilmil is not here!

574
02:14:42,166 --> 02:14:48,332
Get him... catch him...

575
02:15:46,125 --> 02:15:47,290
Daju...

576
02:15:49,083 --> 02:15:50,082
Jhilmil...

577
02:15:55,291 --> 02:15:56,707
I hope you haven't told anyone.

578
02:15:57,833 --> 02:15:58,832
Please don't.

579
02:16:01,250 --> 02:16:04,207
What could I do...
I was in a mess.

580
02:16:05,500 --> 02:16:08,415
I thought she'd go missing
for a few hours.

581
02:16:08,625 --> 02:16:11,582
This was the best way to get money
from my own family!

582
02:16:12,458 --> 02:16:13,915
The debts were killing me.

583
02:16:14,666 --> 02:16:17,082
Jhilmil's grandpa made sure
I only got a measly amount every month.

584
02:16:17,291 --> 02:16:20,249
He left the rest of his wealth
in Jhilmil's Trust Fund.

585
02:16:22,458 --> 02:16:25,874
This was the only way to
get funds out of the Trust.

586
02:16:28,125 --> 02:16:29,165
I made a mistake.

587
02:16:30,833 --> 02:16:32,207
A grave mistake.

588
02:16:33,416 --> 02:16:35,582
I really care about Jhilmil, Daju.

589
02:16:36,041 --> 02:16:39,165
Will you take Jhilmil
away from here again?

590
02:16:40,208 --> 02:16:41,165
Yes.

591
02:16:41,708 --> 02:16:44,707
Her mother wouldn't want her
to be here.

592
02:16:46,208 --> 02:16:49,457
Do you still need the money?

593
02:16:54,375 --> 02:16:55,457
Jhilmil is...

594
02:16:57,166 --> 02:16:58,290
very happy here.

595
02:18:13,541 --> 02:18:16,249
Daju looked at
Barf I's attempts in silence.

596
02:18:16,916 --> 02:18:18,874
Here was Barfi...

597
02:18:19,666 --> 02:18:22,207
who cared for Jhilmil even
more than he did.

598
02:18:23,291 --> 02:18:27,082
Whether Jhilmil would stay back at Muskaan
or go away with Barfi...

599
02:18:27,583 --> 02:18:30,415
was a decision
he left to Jhilmil.

600
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:50,290
Barfi...

601
02:18:51,500 --> 02:18:52,582
Barfi!

602
02:24:39,958 --> 02:24:42,165
That was the love
I always yearned for.

603
02:24:43,541 --> 02:24:45,040
Just like my grandparents.

604
02:24:46,666 --> 02:24:47,957
True love.

605
02:24:49,125 --> 02:24:51,457
To live together and die together...

606
02:24:53,083 --> 02:24:54,790
in each other's arms.

607
02:24:56,000 --> 02:24:58,040
So no ones left behind in tears.

608
02:25:01,250 --> 02:25:02,499
They left...

609
02:25:03,708 --> 02:25:04,624
together.

610
02:25:05,791 --> 02:25:08,457
Leaving me all alone.

611
02:25:11,083 --> 02:25:13,249
It could have been me
instead of Jhilmil.

612
02:25:14,125 --> 02:25:15,790
But it was Jhilmil who got Barfi.

613
02:25:17,541 --> 02:25:20,624
Because she didn't
plan to fall in love.

614
02:25:21,208 --> 02:25:24,165
She didn't think
about the consequences.

615
02:25:25,791 --> 02:25:29,082
She didn't think
how life would turn out.

616
02:25:30,416 --> 02:25:32,874
She just loved him unconditionally.

617
02:25:33,541 --> 02:25:38,207
And it all turned out well
in the end.
