8
00:02:17,123 --> 00:02:19,353
<i>Chalo,</i> let's play.

9
00:02:26,933 --> 00:02:29,367
Smile. You'll be fine.

10
00:02:29,435 --> 00:02:30,868
Name.

11
00:02:36,442 --> 00:02:39,707
- Name.
- Jamal... Malik.

12
00:02:39,779 --> 00:02:42,441
You have a name. Good.

13
00:02:42,515 --> 00:02:44,642
Stop crying.

14
00:02:44,717 --> 00:02:46,651
<i>Thank you. Thank you.</i>

15
00:02:48,021 --> 00:02:50,785
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you very much.

16
00:02:50,857 --> 00:02:54,054
So, Jamal...

17
00:02:54,127 --> 00:02:55,617
<i>tell me something about yourself.</i>

18
00:02:59,933 --> 00:03:03,061
I work in a call center.
In Juhu.

19
00:03:03,136 --> 00:03:05,127
Good.

20
00:03:05,204 --> 00:03:07,502
<i>A phone basher.</i>

21
00:03:07,574 --> 00:03:09,474
And what type of call center
would that be?

22
00:03:09,542 --> 00:03:12,272
XL 5 mobile phones.

23
00:03:12,345 --> 00:03:17,305
Oh. So you're the one who calls
me up every single day of my
life with special offers, huh?

24
00:03:17,383 --> 00:03:20,944
No. Actually, I'm an assistant.

25
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,988
An assistant phone basher?

26
00:03:25,124 --> 00:03:29,151
And what does a assistant
phone basher do exactly?

27
00:03:29,228 --> 00:03:32,322
I get tea for people and-

28
00:03:32,398 --> 00:03:35,162
Chai wallah.
A chai wallah!

29
00:03:37,937 --> 00:03:40,337
Well, ladies and gentlemen...

30
00:03:40,406 --> 00:03:42,966
Jamal Malik-

31
00:03:43,042 --> 00:03:47,672
...from Mumbai, let's play
<i>Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?</i>

32
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:59,790
So, has he confessed yet?

33
00:03:59,859 --> 00:04:02,885
Except his name, I could not get
anything out of the runt.

34
00:04:02,962 --> 00:04:06,796
You have been here a whole bloody night,
Srinivas. What have you been doing?

35
00:04:06,866 --> 00:04:08,857
He's a tough guy.

36
00:04:08,935 --> 00:04:11,631
A little electricity will loosen his tongue.
Give him.

37
00:04:11,704 --> 00:04:13,695
Yes, sir.

38
00:04:22,281 --> 00:04:26,377
<i>Okay. So, were you wired up?</i>
<i>Mobile or a pager?</i>

39
00:04:27,453 --> 00:04:30,718
A coughing accomplice
in the audience...

40
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:34,021
<i>or a microchip under the skin?</i>

41
00:04:34,093 --> 00:04:36,755
Huh?

42
00:04:40,433 --> 00:04:42,367
- The chip is not here.
- <i>Not here?</i>

43
00:04:42,435 --> 00:04:45,427
- No.
- Okay. Leave the chip.
Leave the chip. Leave the chip.

44
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:48,805
It's hot...

45
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:51,844
and my wife is giving me hell...

46
00:04:51,911 --> 00:04:55,438
and I've got a desk full <i>of</i>
murderers, rapists...

47
00:04:55,515 --> 00:04:59,383
extortionists, bum bandits and you.

48
00:05:01,821 --> 00:05:04,722
So why don't you save us
both a lot of time...

49
00:05:06,492 --> 00:05:09,120
and tell me how you cheated.

50
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:13,121
Hmm.

51
00:05:25,244 --> 00:05:27,235
I'm done, sir.

52
00:05:31,684 --> 00:05:33,675
Now, listen.

53
00:05:36,189 --> 00:05:38,180
Hello.

54
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:42,655
He's unconscious, Juti.
What good is that?

55
00:05:42,729 --> 00:05:44,959
How many times
have I told you, Srinivas?

56
00:05:45,031 --> 00:05:46,931
I'm sorry, sir.

57
00:05:46,999 --> 00:05:50,264
<i>Srinivas. Now we'll have...</i>

58
00:05:50,336 --> 00:05:53,100
Amnesty International here next,
peeing in their pants about human rights.

59
00:05:53,172 --> 00:05:55,470
Sir, I was thinking, um-

60
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:58,908
- Get him down, tidy him up,
please, for God's sake!
- <i>Sir...</i>

61
00:05:58,978 --> 00:06:01,674
what if he did know the answers?

62
00:06:04,417 --> 00:06:08,114
Professors, doctors, lawyers,
general knowledge wallahs...

63
00:06:08,187 --> 00:06:10,246
never get beyond 16,000 rupees.

64
00:06:10,323 --> 00:06:13,622
He's on 10 million.
What the hell can a...

65
00:06:13,693 --> 00:06:15,684
slumdog possibly know?

66
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:19,921
The answers.

67
00:06:25,338 --> 00:06:28,739
I knew the answers.

68
00:08:18,551 --> 00:08:22,419
<i># They can't touch me</i>
<i>We break off, run so fast</i>
<i>they can't even catch me #</i>

69
00:08:22,488 --> 00:08:26,891
<i># Been that gypsy</i>

<i># Some days they suck</i>

<i>we get for the family #</i>

73
00:08:34,901 --> 00:08:39,031
<i># One day I wanna be a star</i>
<i>so I get to hang in a bar#</i>

74
00:08:39,105 --> 00:08:42,597
<i># I'll go to Vegas if they pay us</i>
<i>just to forget my scars #</i>

75
00:08:45,511 --> 00:08:48,412
Sorry.

76
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,081
Sorry. Sorry.

77
00:08:53,152 --> 00:08:54,585
Sorry!

78
00:08:54,654 --> 00:08:56,315
<i># They can't touch me</i>
<i>We break off#</i>

79
00:08:56,389 --> 00:08:58,823

- <i> Athos!</i>

83
00:09:19,578 --> 00:09:23,173
- <i> Cried the two musketeers.</i>
- <i> Musketeers.</i>

84
00:09:23,249 --> 00:09:25,513
- <i> Athos!</i>
- <i> Athos!</i>

85
00:09:25,584 --> 00:09:29,782
<i>Repeat it.</i>
<i>"You have sent for me, sir,"said Athos.</i>

86
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:31,789
- "You have sent for me, sir."
- <i>Ah.</i>

87
00:09:47,206 --> 00:09:49,071
Huh?

88
00:10:09,095 --> 00:10:11,325
So...

89
00:10:11,397 --> 00:10:13,331
Mr. Malik...

90
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:15,959
the man who knows all the answers.

91
00:10:17,403 --> 00:10:19,394
Talk.

92
00:10:20,406 --> 00:10:22,397
Talk.

93
00:10:26,112 --> 00:10:28,046
So, Jamal...

94
00:10:28,114 --> 00:10:31,606
are you ready for the first question
for 1,000 rupees?

95
00:10:31,684 --> 00:10:33,675
Yes.

96
00:10:33,753 --> 00:10:36,881
Not bad money to sit on a chair
and answer a question.

97
00:10:36,956 --> 00:10:39,584
Better than making tea, no?

98
00:10:39,658 --> 00:10:42,183
No. Yes. No.

99
00:10:42,261 --> 00:10:44,126
No? Yes? No?

100
00:10:44,196 --> 00:10:47,256
Is that your final answer?

101
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:51,099
<i>So, remember, you have</i>
<i>three lifelines.</i>

102
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:54,105
Ask the audience, fifty-fifty...

103
00:10:54,173 --> 00:10:55,731
<i>phone a friend.</i>

104
00:10:55,808 --> 00:10:59,369
So the first question for 1,000 rupees.
Here we go.

105
00:11:00,579 --> 00:11:05,539
Who was the star in
the 1973 hit film <i>Zanjeer?</i>

106
00:12:05,111 --> 00:12:07,011
Amitabh?

107
00:12:28,067 --> 00:12:30,126
Amitabh Bachchan!

108
00:12:36,275 --> 00:12:38,004
Salim!

109
00:13:09,108 --> 00:13:12,168
Amitabh Bachchan!

110
00:13:14,346 --> 00:13:17,008
<i>Amitabh!</i>

111
00:13:47,046 --> 00:13:50,209
Yea!

112
00:13:50,282 --> 00:13:53,740
<i>Amitabh-</i>

113
00:14:57,716 --> 00:14:59,616
<i>"A."Amitabh Bachchan.</i>

114
00:15:00,886 --> 00:15:03,047
Guess what. You're right.
You just won 1,000 rupees.

115
00:15:07,092 --> 00:15:09,060
You don't have to be a genius.

116
00:15:09,128 --> 00:15:11,494
I knew it was Amitabh Bachchan.

117
00:15:11,563 --> 00:15:13,554
- Hmm?
- Mmm.

118
00:15:13,632 --> 00:15:16,726
Like I said, don't have to be
a genius.

119
00:15:19,104 --> 00:15:21,698
He's the most famous man in India.

120
00:15:22,975 --> 00:15:25,569
<i>A picture of three lions...</i>

121
00:15:25,644 --> 00:15:28,477
<i>is seen in the national</i>
<i>emblem of India.</i>

122
00:15:28,547 --> 00:15:31,414
What is written underneath?

123
00:15:31,483 --> 00:15:35,044
"A," the truth alone triumphs...

124
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,588
"B," lies alone triumph...

125
00:15:37,656 --> 00:15:41,490
<i>"C,"fashion alone triumphs...</i>

126
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:45,394
"D," money alone triumphs?

127
00:15:49,802 --> 00:15:51,770
What do you think, Jamal?

128
00:15:53,105 --> 00:15:56,233
<i>The most famous phrase</i>
<i>of our country.</i>

129
00:15:56,308 --> 00:15:58,037
Would you like to phone a friend?

130
00:15:58,110 --> 00:16:00,544
Ask the audience.

131
00:16:00,612 --> 00:16:04,514
Put the poor man out of his misery,
ladies and gentlemen.

132
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:09,350
My five-year-old daughter can answer
that question, but you couldn't.

133
00:16:09,421 --> 00:16:12,288
That's strange for
a millionaire genius.

134
00:16:12,358 --> 00:16:14,292
What happened?

135
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:17,454
Your accomplice nip out for a piss?

136
00:16:17,529 --> 00:16:20,293
The inspector is asking something.

137
00:16:20,366 --> 00:16:24,132
How much is pani puri
at Harish's stall on Chowpatty?

138
00:16:24,203 --> 00:16:25,761
What?

139
00:16:25,838 --> 00:16:28,534
<i>Pani puri. One plate, how much?</i>

140
00:16:28,607 --> 00:16:31,474
- Ten rupees.
- Wrong.

141
00:16:31,543 --> 00:16:33,534
Fifteen since Divali.

142
00:16:34,947 --> 00:16:37,973
Who stole
Constable Vermaas's bicycle...

143
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:40,041
outside Santa Cruz
station last Thursday?

144
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,111
You know who that was?

145
00:16:43,188 --> 00:16:45,884
Everyone in Juhu knows that.

146
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:49,894
Even five-year-olds.

147
00:16:52,598 --> 00:16:55,260
<i> Congratulations, Jamal.</i>
<i>You just won 4,000 rupees.</i>

148
00:17:00,606 --> 00:17:03,473
For 16,000 rupees.

149
00:17:05,277 --> 00:17:07,438
Religion.

150
00:17:07,513 --> 00:17:09,572
Interesting.

151
00:17:09,648 --> 00:17:12,242
<i>In depictions of God Rama...</i>

152
00:17:12,317 --> 00:17:16,686
<i>he is famously holding what</i>
<i>in his right hand?</i>

153
00:17:26,231 --> 00:17:28,222
Hey, Jamal.

154
00:18:26,758 --> 00:18:28,692
Jamal-

155
00:19:49,942 --> 00:19:53,673
I wake up every morning wishing I didn't
know the answer to that question.

156
00:19:57,649 --> 00:20:00,379
If it wasn't for Rama and Allah...

157
00:20:01,954 --> 00:20:03,922
I would still have a mother.

158
00:20:13,765 --> 00:20:15,756
A bow and arrow.

159
00:20:15,834 --> 00:20:18,029
Final answer?

160
00:20:20,572 --> 00:20:22,563
Final answer.

161
00:20:22,641 --> 00:20:26,975
Hmm. Ah. <i>Computer-ji,</i>
<i>"D"lock kiya-jaye.</i>

162
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:34,018
You've just won 16,000 rupees.

163
00:20:37,055 --> 00:20:39,046
Well done, my friend.

164
00:20:41,126 --> 00:20:44,357
<i>Time for a commercial break.</i>
<i>Don't go away now.</i>

165
00:20:44,429 --> 00:20:47,830
<i> You got lucky, huh?</i>

166
00:20:47,899 --> 00:20:50,732
If I were you,
I would take the money and run.

167
00:20:50,802 --> 00:20:52,793
You're not gonna get the next one.

168
00:20:52,871 --> 00:20:54,862
<i>Everybody back in 90, please.
Okay?</i>

169
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:57,602
<i>Can you come and do</i>
<i>the controls, please?</i>

170
00:22:07,913 --> 00:22:09,904
Salim.

00:23:24,523 --> 00:23:27,686
Welcome back to <i>Who Wants</i>
<i>to Be a Millionaire?</i>

174
00:23:35,133 --> 00:23:37,124
ask the audience.

175

Yes.

177
00:23:53,018 --> 00:23:57,250
The song "Darshan do Ghanshyam" was

You're right!

What happened to the girl?
They blinded her too?

217
00:38:18,549 --> 00:38:20,540
They had other plans.

218
00:38:21,852 --> 00:38:24,446

Some hotel, huh?

254
00:41:54,498 --> 00:41:58,264
The Taj Mahal is considered the finest
example of Mogul architecture.

<i>during the birth</i>

257
00:42:04,708 --> 00:42:09,338
The Taj Mahal was completed around, uh,
1648, using a labor force of 20,000 workers-

00:42:09,413 --> 00:42:14,407

I will show you 99 names of Allah

<i>Please take off your shoes.</i>

Please. Please.
What time is the next tour?

00:42:54,258 --> 00:42:56,192
We are on a very tight
schedule, you see.

264
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:58,888
Have to see the Red Fort
this afternoon.

265
00:42:58,963 --> 00:43:01,488
- No, I-
- Please, would it be possible...

266
00:43:01,565 --> 00:43:03,556
to show us around now?

267
00:43:03,634 --> 00:43:07,229
Obviously we understand
that it costs more for just the two of us.

But of course, madam.

00:43:11,742 --> 00:43:14,210
Please follow me.

270
00:43:14,278 --> 00:43:18,374
The Taj Mahal was built
by Emperor Khurram...

271
00:43:18,449 --> 00:43:20,576
for his wife Mumtaz.

272
00:43:20,651 --> 00:43:23,586
Was the maximum beautiful
woman in the world.

273
00:43:23,654 --> 00:43:27,681
So, when she died, the emperor decided
to build this...

274
00:43:27,758 --> 00:43:29,885
five-star hotel...

275
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:32,190
for everyone
who'd like to visit her too.

276
00:43:32,262 --> 00:43:36,164
But he died in 1587...

277
00:43:36,233 --> 00:43:39,862
before any of the rooms
were built or any of the lifts.

278
00:43:39,937 --> 00:43:42,269
But the swimming pool,
as you can see...

279
00:43:42,339 --> 00:43:46,605
<i>was completed on schedule,</i>
<i>in top-class fashion.</i>

280
00:43:46,677 --> 00:43:49,373
There's nothing of this
in the guidebook.

281
00:43:49,446 --> 00:43:54,110
The guidebook was written by a bunch <i>of</i>
lazy, good-for-nothing Indian beggars.

282
00:43:54,184 --> 00:43:56,516
Oh.

283
00:43:56,587 --> 00:44:02,423
And this, lady and gentleman,
is the burial place of Mumtaz.

284
00:44:02,493 --> 00:44:05,326
How did she die?

285
00:44:05,396 --> 00:44:08,593
- A road traffic accident.
- Really?

286
00:44:08,665 --> 00:44:11,327
Maximum pileup.

287
00:44:11,402 --> 00:44:15,031
I thought she died in childbirth.

288
00:44:15,105 --> 00:44:19,701
Exactly, sir. She was on the way
to hospital when it happened.

289
00:44:26,216 --> 00:44:28,480
Ready?
Don't move an inch.
