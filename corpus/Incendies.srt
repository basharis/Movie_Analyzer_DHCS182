1
00:04:31,064 --> 00:04:32,827
I'm glad to see you.

2
00:04:42,307 --> 00:04:43,147
Please.

3
00:04:43,571 --> 00:04:51,571
THE TWINS

4
00:05:11,234 --> 00:05:13,395
Last will and testament of
Dr. Nawal Marwan.

5
00:05:13,537 --> 00:05:16,836
Opening of the will to
her two children,

6
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:20,899
Simon Marwan and Jeanne Marwan.

7
00:05:22,379 --> 00:05:24,346
"In accordance with the will,

8
00:05:24,446 --> 00:05:28,348
regulations and rights of
Nawal Marwan,

9
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:30,418
the notary, Jean Lebel,

10
00:05:30,553 --> 00:05:33,613
is named executor."

11
00:05:33,756 --> 00:05:35,883
Hmm ... I must tell you here

12
00:05:36,058 --> 00:05:38,855
that it was your mother's decision.

13
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,260
I was personally against
it, but she insisted.

14
00:05:45,466 --> 00:05:46,558
You know ...

15
00:05:48,203 --> 00:05:50,728
...your mother was more
than an employee.

16
00:05:50,905 --> 00:05:52,202
To my late wife and me

17
00:05:52,306 --> 00:05:55,605
you felt more like part
of our family, so ...

18
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:58,134
I could not refuse.

19
00:06:00,581 --> 00:06:03,880
Hum!
"All my assets are to be
shared between the twins,

20
00:06:03,984 --> 00:06:05,281
Jeanne and Simon Marwan."

21
00:06:05,419 --> 00:06:07,648
"The money is to be equitably
shared"

22
00:06:07,787 --> 00:06:11,086
"My furniture distributed by
mutual agreement."

23
00:06:12,491 --> 00:06:13,753
"Burial"

24
00:06:14,927 --> 00:06:17,157
"Notary Jean Lebel will

25
00:06:17,296 --> 00:06:20,561
bury me without a coffin, naked

26
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:21,893
and without prayers."

27
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,061
"My face turned towards the ground,
my back against the world."

28
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:31,737
"Tombstone and Epitaph"

29
00:06:31,743 --> 00:06:33,768
"No headstone is to be
placed on my grave

30
00:06:33,912 --> 00:06:35,277
and my name engraved nowhere."

31
00:06:35,413 --> 00:06:38,677
"No epitaph is deserved for those
who do not keep their promises."

32
00:06:40,684 --> 00:06:43,084
"To Jeanne and Simon"

33
00:06:43,187 --> 00:06:46,486
"Childhood is like a knife
stuck in the throat

34
00:06:46,624 --> 00:06:48,956
which cannot be removed easily."

35
00:06:51,861 --> 00:06:55,695
"Jeanne, notary Lebel will
hand you an envelope."

36
00:06:57,333 --> 00:07:00,962
"This envelope is for your father."

37
00:07:02,105 --> 00:07:03,936
"Find him

38
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,871
and hand him the envelope."

39
00:07:08,844 --> 00:07:11,677
"Simon, the notary will
hand you an envelope."

40
00:07:11,813 --> 00:07:13,303
I've heard enough.

41
00:07:15,484 --> 00:07:18,453
Oh ... but it's not finished.

42
00:07:20,888 --> 00:07:22,378
Continue.

43
00:07:23,991 --> 00:07:27,017
"Simon, the notary will
hand you an envelope."

44
00:07:27,161 --> 00:07:30,130
"This envelope is for your brother."

45
00:07:31,499 --> 00:07:34,900
"Find him and hand it to him."

46
00:07:39,239 --> 00:07:42,174
"When these envelopes
have been handed

47
00:07:42,342 --> 00:07:46,005
to their addressees, a
letter will be given to you."

48
00:07:46,179 --> 00:07:49,080
"When the silence is broken,
and the promise kept

49
00:07:49,215 --> 00:07:52,377
a stone may be placed
on my grave

50
00:07:52,518 --> 00:07:55,578
and my name engraved on
the stone."

51
00:08:10,668 --> 00:08:12,568
I admit it's a bit strange.

52
00:08:19,876 --> 00:08:21,935
Is there stuff to sign?

53
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:24,206
No, not today.

54
00:08:24,348 --> 00:08:25,576
OK.

55
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:28,210
Thank you, Jean.

56
00:08:28,385 --> 00:08:29,875
- Shall we?
- Wait.

57
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:36,419
You know, the history
of our father.

58
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,857
You know, we have no brother.

59
00:08:38,961 --> 00:08:41,293
Why did you let her write this?

60
00:08:42,698 --> 00:08:44,757
I understand your surprise.

61
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,130
It's ... it's very surprising.

62
00:08:47,269 --> 00:08:48,236
Stop pretending to be innocent!

63
00:08:48,404 --> 00:08:50,928
We know that we speak of, there is
nothing surprising in this.

64
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:53,302
We did not make these
things up, Simon...

65
00:08:53,441 --> 00:08:54,738
They are part of a will.

66
00:08:55,877 --> 00:08:57,401
There's that, too.

67
00:09:13,627 --> 00:09:18,087
Well, this morning your mother
gave us something rather special.

68
00:09:18,232 --> 00:09:20,791
We'll sleep on it, then ...

69
00:09:20,933 --> 00:09:22,798
We'll meet again, huh?

70
00:09:22,935 --> 00:09:25,403
I'll wait outside.
Thank you, Jean.

71
00:09:25,505 --> 00:09:27,439
Sit down, Simon.

72
00:09:27,573 --> 00:09:30,303
Look, Jean ...

73
00:09:30,443 --> 00:09:33,139
your secretary, she loved
working for you.

74
00:09:34,179 --> 00:09:37,910
She did this well all her
life, congratulations.

75
00:09:38,016 --> 00:09:40,246
Your secretary, however, was also
my mother.

76
00:09:40,352 --> 00:09:43,116
Then her job as a mother,
that's another story.

77
00:09:43,288 --> 00:09:44,312
Simon ...

78
00:09:44,456 --> 00:09:46,947
You can bury your secretary
in any way you wish.

79
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:49,684
But my mother, I want her
buried in the normal way.

80
00:09:49,827 --> 00:09:51,419
For once in your fucking life

81
00:09:51,529 --> 00:09:53,622
make it something normal.

82
00:09:55,499 --> 00:09:56,989
This is not negotiable.

83
00:10:10,847 --> 00:10:12,212
Take your time.

84
00:10:12,348 --> 00:10:14,976
And come see me when Simon
has calmed down.

85
00:10:19,888 --> 00:10:22,482
I know it's very unusual, but ...

86
00:10:24,993 --> 00:10:27,484
your mother was not crazy, Jeanne.

87
00:10:46,814 --> 00:10:48,872
We have a large family now.

88
00:10:53,687 --> 00:10:55,086
She spoke of a traitor?

89
00:10:55,222 --> 00:10:57,816
In a big family, there's always a dog.

90
00:10:57,924 --> 00:11:00,552
How long will it be before we
find the traitor?

91
00:11:01,728 --> 00:11:03,251
Fucking crazy woman!

92
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,829
I'll fix that with Jean.

93
00:11:10,936 --> 00:11:12,369
Fix what?

94
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:15,065
We'll give her a
normal funeral.

95
00:11:18,243 --> 00:11:21,212
We'll take care of her, then
I'll take care of you.

96
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:36,426
Where are you going?

97
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,721
You bury her any way you like!

98
00:11:38,896 --> 00:11:40,386
Oh, stop!

99
00:11:41,732 --> 00:11:43,723
You feel guilty because
you were not there

100
00:11:43,901 --> 00:11:44,868
when she died.

101
00:11:44,968 --> 00:11:46,798
You feel guilty because
you were there

102
00:11:46,936 --> 00:11:48,233
when she had her accident.

103
00:11:48,404 --> 00:11:50,929
You need to stop you feeling
guilty for everything!

104
00:11:51,073 --> 00:11:52,768
I am not feeling guilty
about anything.

105
00:11:52,909 --> 00:11:55,400
Do you realize the significance of
what he just read?

106
00:11:55,578 --> 00:11:56,738
Well, she's gone!

107
00:11:56,879 --> 00:11:58,779
It's over, I'm at peace!

108
00:12:03,418 --> 00:12:05,545
I have fucking peace!

109
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:12,784
I'm at peace now.

110
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:17,056
Yes, I see.

111
00:12:21,335 --> 00:12:25,135
Mathematics as you
have known so far

112
00:12:25,272 --> 00:12:29,231
have aimed to achieve a precise
and definitive response

113
00:12:29,343 --> 00:12:32,277
to precise and definitive problems.

114
00:12:32,445 --> 00:12:35,903
Now, you are about to enter into
entirely different adventure.

115
00:12:36,015 --> 00:12:38,506
The subject will be
intractable problems

116
00:12:38,651 --> 00:12:40,243
that will always lead

117
00:12:40,353 --> 00:12:43,288
to other problems just
as intractable.

118
00:12:43,456 --> 00:12:46,151
People around you will
repeatedly insist

119
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:49,283
that what you are doing is
hopeless.

120
00:12:49,461 --> 00:12:52,453
You'll have no argument
to defend yourself,

121
00:12:52,598 --> 00:12:55,362
because they will be of an
overwhelming complexity.

122
00:12:56,768 --> 00:12:59,703
Welcome to pure mathematics,

123
00:12:59,838 --> 00:13:01,828
the land of loneliness.

124
00:13:01,973 --> 00:13:04,965
This is my assistant,

125
00:13:05,109 --> 00:13:06,940
Miss Jeanne Marwan.

126
00:13:07,979 --> 00:13:09,469
Hello!

127
00:13:12,717 --> 00:13:15,514
We will start with the conjecture
of Syracuse.

128
00:13:18,355 --> 00:13:20,823
What does your intuition
tell you?

129
00:13:27,964 --> 00:13:29,828
Your intuition is always right.

130
00:13:29,999 --> 00:13:32,194
That's why you got potential

131
00:13:32,334 --> 00:13:34,734
to becoming a real mathematician.

132
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:37,498
But over there, you'll need help.

133
00:13:38,674 --> 00:13:40,665
Do you have any family there?

134
00:13:42,211 --> 00:13:44,872
- Contacts?
- It's ridiculous, Niv.

135
00:13:45,013 --> 00:13:48,540
You've come to learn that
a) your father is alive;

136
00:13:48,683 --> 00:13:50,742
and b) you have another brother.

137
00:13:50,885 --> 00:13:51,977
This is ridiculous

138
00:13:52,086 --> 00:13:55,487
What is ridiculous to question
the inevitable.

139
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:57,080
You need to know.

140
00:13:58,092 --> 00:14:00,753
Otherwise, your mind
will never be at peace.

141
00:14:02,763 --> 00:14:06,426
And peace of mind has nothing to
do with pure mathematics.

142
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:12,163
You need a starting point.

143
00:14:17,877 --> 00:14:20,209
My father died during
the war in Daresh.

144
00:14:20,346 --> 00:14:22,576
That's the unknown variable
in the equation.

145
00:14:22,715 --> 00:14:25,707
You never start with the
unknown variable.

146
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,584
My mother used to speak about
a village

147
00:14:29,721 --> 00:14:31,552
called Der Om, in Fouad.

148
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:35,055
She graduated in French

149
00:14:35,226 --> 00:14:36,557
at the University of Daresh.

150
00:14:36,695 --> 00:14:39,630
If she studied, there is hope.

151
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:43,723
Said Haidar.

152
00:14:43,901 --> 00:14:46,461
You'll go knock on the
door Said Haidar

153
00:14:46,603 --> 00:14:49,037
an old friend of mine who
teaches at Daresh.

154
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:51,073
You can trust him.

155
00:17:47,239 --> 00:17:48,968
What are you doing?

156
00:17:49,107 --> 00:17:52,201
Mom! Are you Okay?

157
00:17:55,713 --> 00:17:58,079
Madam, that's my towel, please.

158
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:00,906
Mom?

159
00:18:02,419 --> 00:18:03,886
Mom!

160
00:18:27,276 --> 00:18:28,766
Mom?

161
00:18:30,846 --> 00:18:32,336
What happened?

162
00:18:35,017 --> 00:18:36,450
Where's Jeanne?

163
00:18:39,454 --> 00:18:40,943
Mom?

164
00:18:53,467 --> 00:18:55,161
Does she suffer from migraines?

165
00:18:55,302 --> 00:18:56,291
No.

166
00:18:56,436 --> 00:18:58,597
- Memory loss?
- No.

167
00:18:58,705 --> 00:19:00,866
Loss of balance?

168
00:19:01,007 --> 00:19:02,031
No.

169
00:19:02,175 --> 00:19:03,767
Absent-minded?

170
00:19:03,877 --> 00:19:05,845
She's always absent.

171
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:08,379
No, she was never absent.

172
00:20:19,214 --> 00:20:20,875
Wahab, come.

173
00:20:44,137 --> 00:20:45,570
Just get out of my sister's way.

174
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:50,800
Son of refugees, where do you
think you're going?

175
00:20:56,214 --> 00:20:58,648
Nicolas, stop!

176
00:20:59,117 --> 00:21:00,243
Go back to your country.

177
00:21:01,486 --> 00:21:02,384
Wahab!

178
00:21:02,988 --> 00:21:06,048
We'll leave your hide
in your camps, believe me.

179
00:21:06,792 --> 00:21:07,780
Give me.

180
00:21:08,426 --> 00:21:10,326
- I want to kill her.
- It's mine to do.

181
00:21:12,463 --> 00:21:14,761
You have sullied the
family honor.

182
00:21:15,433 --> 00:21:16,331
- Enough!

183
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:19,164
Go home!

184
00:21:20,271 --> 00:21:22,101
Go home!

185
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:30,076
Outside.

186
00:21:36,985 --> 00:21:38,976
What have you done!

187
00:21:39,154 --> 00:21:42,590
You have humiliated us!
You have sullied the name of our family!

188
00:21:42,858 --> 00:21:46,487
Why God have you plunged
us in the dark?

189
00:21:49,298 --> 00:21:52,630
My God, what have you done?
Why did you do that?

190
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,667
What will I do with you!
You want me to kill you?

191
00:21:57,605 --> 00:21:59,766
I'm pregnant, grandma.

192
00:22:00,842 --> 00:22:03,970
- My God, everything is black.
Why?

193
00:22:04,145 --> 00:22:06,339
Why have you done this?

194
00:22:07,047 --> 00:22:09,345
Do I have to kill you?

195
00:22:10,016 --> 00:22:12,484
What will I do with you?

196
00:23:32,027 --> 00:23:33,289
Come.

197
00:23:35,229 --> 00:23:37,925
Eat if you want your
child safe.

198
00:23:44,405 --> 00:23:46,100
Listen to me.

199
00:23:47,107 --> 00:23:49,268
There's nothing here for you.

200
00:23:50,777 --> 00:23:53,371
I'll help after the birth.

201
00:23:53,546 --> 00:23:55,639
I want you to go away.

202
00:23:57,250 --> 00:24:01,152
You'll go to live with
your uncle Charbel.

203
00:24:02,155 --> 00:24:04,452
There, you'll go to school.

204
00:24:04,556 --> 00:24:06,820
To learn to read,
to learn to think

205
00:24:06,992 --> 00:24:10,052
out of this misery.

206
00:24:11,663 --> 00:24:13,995
Promise me and I'll help you.

207
00:24:16,802 --> 00:24:20,430
Promise me you'll go to school.

208
00:24:26,777 --> 00:24:28,506
I promise you, grandmother.

209
00:24:31,015 --> 00:24:32,312
I promise.

210
00:26:35,564 --> 00:26:37,054
Shh.

211
00:26:52,313 --> 00:26:53,803
Shh.

212
00:27:13,833 --> 00:27:17,791
Look carefully at your mother.
You'll have to recognize her.

213
00:27:21,006 --> 00:27:27,241
I'll find you one day.
I promise you, my heart.

214
00:27:37,455 --> 00:27:40,481
Be careful.
Don't worry.

215
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:16,657
Come on, it's time
for you to go.

216
00:28:17,826 --> 00:28:21,785
I feel that something terrible
is coming ...

217
00:28:37,478 --> 00:28:40,311
One day I'll find you, my son.

218
00:30:16,937 --> 00:30:20,805
I received a message
from my friend Niv Cohen

219
00:30:20,941 --> 00:30:23,000
but I can't help you

220
00:30:23,143 --> 00:30:25,111
because at the time,

221
00:30:25,245 --> 00:30:26,439
I taught

222
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:29,946
History of Mathematics
in Paris.

223
00:30:30,115 --> 00:30:32,982
Specifically, the period

224
00:30:33,118 --> 00:30:37,077
where Euler had
succeeded

225
00:30:37,189 --> 00:30:39,123
to give the first

226
00:30:39,291 --> 00:30:42,454
formal mathematical resolution

227
00:30:42,627 --> 00:30:47,326
to the problem of the seven bridges
of Konigsberg, yes.

228
00:30:47,465 --> 00:30:50,457
Diderot defied the Court

229
00:30:50,602 --> 00:30:52,502
saying:

230
00:30:52,637 --> 00:30:53,695
"Gentlemen ..."

231
00:30:53,838 --> 00:30:57,466
I-ft plus

232
00:30:57,641 --> 00:30:58,972
Equals zero.

233
00:30:59,977 --> 00:31:02,138
So, God exists!"

234
00:31:04,314 --> 00:31:06,646
Niv, Niv, Niv ...

235
00:31:20,563 --> 00:31:22,724
Hello! Do you speak French?

236
00:31:22,865 --> 00:31:24,730
- Yes, of course!
- Can I help you?

237
00:31:24,867 --> 00:31:28,529
Uh, yes, I am looking for someone
who would have known this woman.

238
00:31:30,005 --> 00:31:32,496
She studied here maybe
35 years ago.

239
00:31:34,542 --> 00:31:36,066
Are you kidding me?

240
00:31:36,211 --> 00:31:37,371
I wasn't even born.

241
00:31:37,512 --> 00:31:39,673
Well, you're in the wrong
place...

242
00:31:39,814 --> 00:31:40,974
I'm not kidding.

243
00:31:41,082 --> 00:31:43,140
I'm sure you know someone
who can help me.

244
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:44,808
I have come from far away.

245
00:31:44,918 --> 00:31:47,580
Please. Her name is Nawal Marwan.

246
00:31:56,529 --> 00:31:58,190
You are very kind.

247
00:31:58,331 --> 00:32:01,164
I'm not nice, I want
to get rid of you.

248
00:32:01,234 --> 00:32:02,826
Najat, that's me.

249
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:05,433
You have time to waste?

250
00:32:06,572 --> 00:32:09,040
That tells me something.

251
00:32:09,175 --> 00:32:13,577
She may have worked in the
campus newspaper.

252
00:32:14,613 --> 00:32:16,103
It's been a long time.

253
00:32:18,717 --> 00:32:22,710
People who leave usually
change identities.

254
00:32:25,457 --> 00:32:27,390
It is striking nonetheless.

255
00:32:38,736 --> 00:32:42,865
Your mother was photographed
in Kfar Ryat.

256
00:32:42,972 --> 00:32:44,462
Look here.

257
00:32:45,775 --> 00:32:48,767
This is a sign of Kfar Ryat.

258
00:32:49,813 --> 00:32:52,714
It is a prison in the south.

259
00:32:56,785 --> 00:32:58,912
You do not know Kfar Ryat?

260
00:32:59,054 --> 00:33:00,078
- No.

261
00:33:00,255 --> 00:33:03,656
You're definitely not from
here.

262
00:33:04,927 --> 00:33:07,760
You don't know the South.

263
00:33:40,626 --> 00:33:42,753
If the international community

264
00:33:44,029 --> 00:33:46,657
does not intervene now

265
00:33:48,134 --> 00:33:49,658
The refugees in overcrowded

266
00:33:51,203 --> 00:33:55,696
camps at the border ...will be
massacred.

267
00:33:59,010 --> 00:34:00,500
She has arrived.

268
00:34:00,645 --> 00:34:01,771
OK.

269
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:04,644
We, the students, are oppose
against the Nationalist Party

270
00:34:04,783 --> 00:34:07,149
that are trying to evict the refugees
across the borders.

271
00:34:07,318 --> 00:34:08,649
The National Party supports

272
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:10,343
militias of the Christian right,

273
00:34:10,487 --> 00:34:12,387
who make open threats against
the refugees.

274
00:34:12,523 --> 00:34:14,514
In the South, the refugees
are now armed.

275
00:34:14,658 --> 00:34:16,455
And have the support

276
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:20,860
of much of the country's Muslim
population.

277
00:34:20,998 --> 00:34:24,194
But you ...you're a Christian.

278
00:34:24,333 --> 00:34:26,824
We are for peace.

279
00:34:26,969 --> 00:34:29,335
Religion has nothing
to do with it.

280
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:39,912
Nawal!

281
00:34:40,682 --> 00:34:43,173
Put the radio!
They've come to close
the University!

282
00:34:43,351 --> 00:34:46,013
The Nationalists have
closed the campus!

283
00:35:01,435 --> 00:35:03,198
Nawal, come back.

284
00:35:04,004 --> 00:35:05,665
Stay here.

285
00:35:08,775 --> 00:35:11,266
Uncle Charbel, the Nationalists
are closing the campus!

286
00:35:11,544 --> 00:35:15,241
There will be clashes.

287
00:35:15,415 --> 00:35:17,576
Stay with me.

288
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:37,461
There is shooting outside ...

289
00:35:40,204 --> 00:35:41,364
To the table, girls!

290
00:35:41,539 --> 00:35:43,404
Mom, they're attacking
the university!

291
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:46,271
It's not a reason not to eat!

292
00:35:54,251 --> 00:35:55,741
Aioua?

293
00:36:25,947 --> 00:36:29,246
Christian villages were attacked
in the South this morning.

294
00:36:29,417 --> 00:36:31,510
May God protect us!

295
00:36:31,686 --> 00:36:33,677
That's why they closed
the university.

296
00:36:33,855 --> 00:36:37,187
In short time, it will
explode here as well.

297
00:36:38,792 --> 00:36:43,661
We'll go to the mountain
until it calms down.

298
00:36:44,631 --> 00:36:46,121
For how long?

299
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,858
We start tomorrow.

300
00:36:48,035 --> 00:36:50,799
The rest of the family
is already there.

301
00:36:50,971 --> 00:36:52,460
And the school?

302
00:36:53,606 --> 00:36:55,972
Anyway, the school will close.

303
00:36:56,475 --> 00:36:58,443
Only God knows how long.

304
00:36:58,978 --> 00:37:00,206
And Le Journal?

305
00:37:01,047 --> 00:37:02,537
Don't be afraid.

306
00:37:02,715 --> 00:37:06,116
Le Journal can survive without
us for a while.

307
00:37:06,952 --> 00:37:09,978
But ideas only survive if someone
is there to defend them!

308
00:37:10,155 --> 00:37:11,952
Exactly, Rafqa.

309
00:37:13,024 --> 00:37:14,616
Exactly.

310
00:37:26,170 --> 00:37:28,832
There are only two orphanages
in the region.

311
00:37:28,973 --> 00:37:30,838
I will join you soon.

312
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:33,169
You will not go there now!

313
00:37:35,045 --> 00:37:37,342
You had promised Grandma you
would finish your studies.

314
00:37:37,513 --> 00:37:39,037
You heard your father.

315
00:37:39,182 --> 00:37:42,208
It's going to explode across the country
if they attack the camps.

316
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:44,686
The studies are finished.

317
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:51,018
I think of him every day.

318
00:37:51,193 --> 00:37:52,854
That's my child.

319
00:37:54,096 --> 00:37:55,825
I want to find him alive.

320
00:38:16,951 --> 00:38:19,419
I'm going to fetch
water from Shadia.

321
00:38:19,587 --> 00:38:21,850
Hurry, Nawal.

322
00:40:21,199 --> 00:40:22,996
- Your name?
- Nawal.

323
00:40:23,168 --> 00:40:25,500
- Nawal what?
- Nawal Marwan.

324
00:40:26,338 --> 00:40:27,498
Where are you going?

325
00:40:27,906 --> 00:40:28,873
South.

326
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,029
What for?

327
00:40:30,809 --> 00:40:32,538
To meet my husband.

328
00:42:54,542 --> 00:42:55,975
Wahab.

329
00:43:22,669 --> 00:43:25,069
You have only daughters?

330
00:43:25,672 --> 00:43:28,505
The older boys are in Kfar
Kout.

331
00:43:30,976 --> 00:43:34,139
You should go with us.
Kfar Kout was attacked
yesterday.

332
00:45:04,130 --> 00:45:07,622
Looking for the orphanage.
You know where is it?

333
00:45:08,334 --> 00:45:09,266
There.

334
00:45:10,236 --> 00:45:13,171
The children?
Where are the children?

335
00:45:14,172 --> 00:45:16,504
You should speak with those
who were there.

336
00:45:16,674 --> 00:45:22,078
The muslim villagers fled
to the camp Deressa.

337
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:25,174
They fear reprisals will come.

338
00:45:25,617 --> 00:45:28,744
The children may be with them.

339
00:45:30,621 --> 00:45:36,856
Chamseddine and his men killed all the
Christians to avenge the refugees.

340
00:45:38,962 --> 00:45:42,693
Perhaps the children are in Deressa.

341
00:47:06,244 --> 00:47:08,212
Can you take me to the camp in Deressa?

342
00:51:11,271 --> 00:51:12,738
I am a Christian.

343
00:51:24,751 --> 00:51:27,311
My daughter! My daughter!

344
00:51:34,127 --> 00:51:35,355
Mom!

345
00:55:03,554 --> 00:55:04,953
Hi, Simon, it's me!

346
00:55:05,056 --> 00:55:06,853
I am in Mama's village.

347
00:55:06,991 --> 00:55:08,788
I wish you were here with me.

348
00:55:08,893 --> 00:55:09,825
Listen.

349
00:55:32,649 --> 00:55:35,014
Oh, I'm sorry, I do not understand.

350
00:56:08,682 --> 00:56:11,845
I told you never to come here again!

351
00:56:15,188 --> 00:56:16,177
Hello!

352
00:56:17,523 --> 00:56:18,512
Souha?

353
00:56:22,061 --> 00:56:25,030
Ahmed loves you!
Ahmed loves you!

354
00:56:29,402 --> 00:56:32,461
I told you not to say that again!

355
00:56:35,206 --> 00:56:36,195
Hello.

356
00:56:36,708 --> 00:56:37,766
Can I help you?

357
00:56:41,780 --> 00:56:42,747
Hello.

358
00:56:44,215 --> 00:56:48,548
Does anyone speak French
or English?

359
00:56:49,219 --> 00:56:50,914
Where's Sami?

360
00:56:59,596 --> 00:57:01,586
Marhaba!
Marhaba!

361
00:57:02,632 --> 00:57:04,657
Hello!
Hello!

362
00:57:04,801 --> 00:57:05,790
Hello!

363
00:57:12,288 --> 00:57:13,561
Uh, Jeanne.

364
00:57:20,068 --> 00:57:21,365
Jeanne.

365
00:57:25,006 --> 00:57:26,337
Jeanne.

366
00:57:28,308 --> 00:57:29,673
Uh ...

367
00:57:34,313 --> 00:57:35,302
Thank you.

368
00:57:50,860 --> 00:57:54,318
- You speak French?
- Yes, hello!

369
00:57:54,430 --> 00:57:55,829
Hello.

370
00:57:55,932 --> 00:57:58,400
My name is Samia.

371
00:57:58,534 --> 00:58:00,831
I am Jeanne Marwan.

372
00:58:00,935 --> 00:58:02,334
Thank you for helping me.

373
00:58:02,436 --> 00:58:05,872
Marwan?
There are many Marwans here.

374
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:07,530
Really?

375
00:58:08,909 --> 00:58:11,036
Well, I'm from Canada.

376
00:58:12,078 --> 00:58:14,046
I'm looking for Souha.

377
00:58:14,214 --> 00:58:16,340
She is Souha.

378
00:58:16,448 --> 00:58:19,178
She is my great-grandmother.

379
00:58:19,284 --> 00:58:21,878
- Oh! Marhaba!
- Marhaba.

380
00:58:28,393 --> 00:58:31,589
The people in the corner shop
told me to come see you.

381
00:58:38,034 --> 00:58:39,626
I am looking for my father.

382
00:58:39,769 --> 00:58:41,430
His name is Wahab.

383
00:58:47,241 --> 00:58:50,472
Uh ...My mother's name
is Nawal Marwan.

384
00:58:52,279 --> 00:58:53,439
She was born here.

385
00:59:01,453 --> 00:59:02,943
We do not know her.

386
00:59:04,121 --> 00:59:05,645
Of course you know her.

387
00:59:11,996 --> 00:59:15,226
The Marwan family was struck with
shame.

388
00:59:33,246 --> 00:59:35,237
When the war came.

389
00:59:40,152 --> 00:59:42,518
Uh, I'm looking for Wahab.

390
00:59:46,290 --> 00:59:48,258
She does not know Wahab.

391
00:59:52,529 --> 00:59:57,262
I can not help you.
Sorry, I'm tired.

392
01:00:06,307 --> 01:00:10,300
If you're Nawal Marwan daughter,

393
01:00:11,479 --> 01:00:14,504
you're not welcome here.

394
01:00:14,647 --> 01:00:16,137
Go home.

395
01:00:20,686 --> 01:00:22,551
She is looking for her father,

396
01:00:22,721 --> 01:00:25,519
but she doesn't know
who is her mother.

397
01:02:59,452 --> 01:03:02,580
<i>I arrived at the end of the massacre
in the Deressa refugee camp.</i>

398
01:03:04,023 --> 01:03:05,957
<i>Everything was burning.</i>

399
01:03:07,826 --> 01:03:10,658
<i>I looked for my son amid
waves of blood.</i>

400
01:03:11,295 --> 01:03:15,493
<i>I was disheartened by what I saw
and heard.</i>

401
01:03:16,699 --> 01:03:18,929
You claim to be against
our enemy.

402
01:03:19,669 --> 01:03:22,866
That does not make you our friend.

403
01:03:24,374 --> 01:03:26,933
Chamseddine. why would
he trust you?

404
01:03:28,209 --> 01:03:30,507
My son's father was
a refugee from Deressa.

405
01:03:30,678 --> 01:03:32,646
My son has been swallowed
by the war.

406
01:03:34,181 --> 01:03:36,308
I have nothing to lose.

407
01:03:38,184 --> 01:03:41,209
My hatred is great toward
the Nationalists.

408
01:03:42,354 --> 01:03:45,653
This is not what you wrote
in Charbel's journal.

409
01:03:46,725 --> 01:03:51,219
My uncle Charbel thought to encourage
peace with words and books.

410
01:03:52,797 --> 01:03:54,355
I believed that.

411
01:03:56,867 --> 01:03:58,698
Life has taught me
something else.

412
01:04:01,504 --> 01:04:03,301
What are you going to do now?

413
01:04:05,908 --> 01:04:09,536
Teach the enemy what
life has taught me.

414
01:05:03,556 --> 01:05:05,717
That's good. That's good.

415
01:05:05,891 --> 01:05:08,723
You've just forgotten it. Let's go.

416
01:05:13,630 --> 01:05:15,427
So in French?

417
01:05:16,900 --> 01:05:19,562
I ... I am much better, Dad.

418
01:05:19,737 --> 01:05:21,204
They say "a lot" or "best"

419
01:05:21,305 --> 01:05:24,034
but never both at the same
time, my darling.

420
01:05:26,908 --> 01:05:29,706
I want my son to learn to speak
several languages.

421
01:05:29,878 --> 01:05:32,745
I want him to understand others
without an intermediary.

422
01:05:59,169 --> 01:06:01,831
How are you, Nawal?
It's Nouchine.

423
01:06:03,006 --> 01:06:06,339
Good evening, Nouchine.
How's your mother?

424
01:06:06,509 --> 01:06:10,308
My mother is very well.
10:00 o'clock tomorrow.

425
01:06:12,414 --> 01:06:14,109
Tomorrow.

426
01:07:03,657 --> 01:07:05,147
Marhaba.

427
01:07:30,245 --> 01:07:31,303
Hello, beautiful.

428
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:32,572
Good morning.

429
01:07:33,014 --> 01:07:34,743
Then you will be going out
with us on Thursday?

430
01:07:34,916 --> 01:07:35,905
No.

431
01:07:36,584 --> 01:07:37,516
Friday?

432
01:07:37,685 --> 01:07:38,743
No.

433
01:07:38,918 --> 01:07:39,850
Saturday?

434
01:07:40,019 --> 01:07:41,316
No.

435
01:07:42,889 --> 01:07:45,016
We are patient!

436
01:07:45,225 --> 01:07:46,658
Me too.

437
01:08:00,570 --> 01:08:01,537
Never forget:

438
01:08:01,705 --> 01:08:03,696
"Always" is "always".

439
01:09:05,891 --> 01:09:06,880
Fucking bitch.

440
01:10:49,811 --> 01:10:52,006
The prison at Kfar
Ryat was condemned in

441
01:10:52,180 --> 01:10:55,047
several reports by Amnesty
International.

442
01:11:03,690 --> 01:11:05,658
Here is the women's section.

443
01:11:07,227 --> 01:11:08,888
The cells are larger.

444
01:11:09,029 --> 01:11:12,192
Some prisoners remained
there up to 15 years.

445
01:11:21,705 --> 01:11:25,038
- It has existed since when?
- At the time of the massacres.

446
01:11:25,175 --> 01:11:27,006
Just after the war began.

447
01:11:27,110 --> 01:11:29,840
They have 600 political
prisoners jailed.

448
01:11:32,580 --> 01:11:33,911
You can come in, eh?

449
01:11:34,049 --> 01:11:35,573
I'll take a picture.

450
01:11:47,560 --> 01:11:49,289
You know this woman?

451
01:11:50,229 --> 01:11:51,196
No.

452
01:11:51,296 --> 01:11:53,526
She was imprisoned here.

453
01:11:55,434 --> 01:11:56,458
I don't know her.

454
01:11:56,601 --> 01:11:58,762
It was a really long time
ago, you know? I...

455
01:11:58,904 --> 01:12:01,872
Maybe you know someone
who worked here.

456
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:43,068
Hello.

457
01:12:50,279 --> 01:12:51,473
Hello.

458
01:12:54,850 --> 01:12:57,284
I'm looking for Harrsa Fahim.

459
01:13:00,955 --> 01:13:03,947
I am the school janitor.

460
01:13:04,091 --> 01:13:05,991
Yes, but before, what were you?

461
01:13:06,126 --> 01:13:08,526
Before, hum!

462
01:13:08,661 --> 01:13:11,528
That was before I became the
school janitor.

463
01:13:11,664 --> 01:13:14,963
It's been a long time since I'm
caretaker of the school.

464
01:13:17,201 --> 01:13:19,135
You know this woman?

465
01:13:19,303 --> 01:13:20,930
She was in Kfar Ryat.

466
01:13:23,875 --> 01:13:27,140
I am a school janitor.
Bess! That's all.

467
01:13:30,213 --> 01:13:32,339
I am looking for someone
who knew her.

468
01:13:32,481 --> 01:13:34,949
Someone who could
tell me about her.

469
01:13:37,485 --> 01:13:38,952
This is my mother.

470
01:13:42,157 --> 01:13:45,023
This is the woman who sings.

471
01:13:45,159 --> 01:13:46,285
Number 72.

472
01:13:48,461 --> 01:13:50,895
It was she who murdered the
militia leader

473
01:13:51,030 --> 01:13:52,497
of the christian right.

474
01:13:53,699 --> 01:13:55,860
They made her pay dearly.

475
01:13:56,002 --> 01:13:58,835
Very, very dearly.
Fifteen years.

476
01:14:03,841 --> 01:14:05,741
They used to call her the
woman who sings

477
01:14:05,876 --> 01:14:08,037
because she sang all the time.

478
01:14:09,145 --> 01:14:11,170
Han, you are sure it's her?

479
01:14:12,248 --> 01:14:15,080
I spent 13 years as a watchman.

480
01:14:16,919 --> 01:14:21,686
Have you ever spent 13 years
overseeing someone?

481
01:14:24,659 --> 01:14:27,219
They did everything
to make her break.

482
01:14:28,863 --> 01:14:32,923
In the end, she was
still standing,

483
01:14:33,065 --> 01:14:35,158
She looked ...

484
01:14:36,202 --> 01:14:38,033
Ah! Never seen anything like it.

485
01:14:38,204 --> 01:14:40,536
She never broke.

486
01:14:40,672 --> 01:14:43,505
It was exasperating.

487
01:14:50,713 --> 01:14:53,375
And then they sent Abu Tarek.

488
01:14:53,549 --> 01:14:54,538
Who's that?

489
01:15:04,625 --> 01:15:06,752
Abu Tarek...

490
01:15:07,962 --> 01:15:11,454
You know, sometimes it's better

491
01:15:11,598 --> 01:15:14,122
not to know everything.

492
01:15:14,266 --> 01:15:16,234
Sir, I live with it anyway.

493
01:15:17,236 --> 01:15:18,726
Continue.

494
01:15:20,272 --> 01:15:21,466
Abu Tarek...

495
01:15:22,907 --> 01:15:26,399
Abu Tarek was a investigation
specialist.

496
01:15:26,577 --> 01:15:28,737
He raped her repeatedly

497
01:15:28,912 --> 01:15:31,813
to break her before being
released.

498
01:15:31,948 --> 01:15:34,746
To stop her from singing.

499
01:15:38,287 --> 01:15:41,916
Eventually she became pregnant.

500
01:15:43,490 --> 01:15:45,424
It was like that.

501
01:15:45,592 --> 01:15:47,753
I'll never forget it.

502
01:15:47,928 --> 01:15:51,386
Number 72 pregnant by Abu Tarek.

503
01:15:53,300 --> 01:15:54,927
They waited ...

504
01:15:55,067 --> 01:15:57,558
for her to give birth in prison

505
01:15:57,670 --> 01:16:00,638
then they let her go.

506
01:16:03,941 --> 01:16:06,739
The child?
Did you see the child?

507
01:16:08,946 --> 01:16:12,347
There was a doctor who came
sometimes.

508
01:16:13,349 --> 01:16:15,442
I think he's crazy.

509
01:16:15,617 --> 01:16:18,950
Others say he has a restaurant
in Tel Aviv ...

510
01:16:21,189 --> 01:16:22,622
That's bullshit.

511
01:16:22,758 --> 01:16:25,454
He went mad and died.

512
01:16:25,626 --> 01:16:28,992
His nurse, I know her.

513
01:16:29,129 --> 01:16:31,290
She lives in Daresh.

514
01:16:34,334 --> 01:16:35,824
In Daresh?

515
01:16:44,475 --> 01:16:45,874
Listen, Simon, I'm calling you!

516
01:16:46,009 --> 01:16:49,206
I'm calling you, no, shut up, OK?
Shut your mouth!

517
01:16:49,346 --> 01:16:51,837
Mom, she was in prison.
Simon, mom, she ...

518
01:16:53,116 --> 01:16:54,981
Mom, she was raped.

519
01:16:56,485 --> 01:16:58,543
Our brother, she had him in prison.

520
01:17:00,355 --> 01:17:02,220
I need you here.

521
01:17:19,049 --> 01:17:23,149
THE WOMAN THAT SINGS

522
01:20:01,474 --> 01:20:04,807
This, Simon, are notary Amyott
contracts

523
01:20:04,977 --> 01:20:05,966
from 1868 to 1892.

524
01:20:06,111 --> 01:20:09,443
His son took over,
Édouard, until 1925.

525
01:20:09,546 --> 01:20:11,878
All the contracts are hand-written.

526
01:20:12,015 --> 01:20:14,779
My grandfather, Charles,
my father, Henry.

527
01:20:14,885 --> 01:20:16,352
And me.

528
01:20:16,486 --> 01:20:19,182
Yeah, well, it stops there
because as you know,

529
01:20:19,322 --> 01:20:20,687
I am the last of the Lebel.

530
01:20:20,823 --> 01:20:23,223
I'll show you the
will of a man ...

531
01:20:26,161 --> 01:20:27,992
...which took several lives.

532
01:20:30,798 --> 01:20:32,197
His heirs have discovered

533
01:20:32,333 --> 01:20:34,164
he had three wives, all
at the same time.

534
01:20:34,301 --> 01:20:35,325
One here, one in Miami,

535
01:20:35,503 --> 01:20:38,165
and another in Honduras,
where he did business.

536
01:20:39,571 --> 01:20:43,405
No, no ...he not longer has
three children in the file there, no

537
01:20:43,542 --> 01:20:44,509
There are eight.

538
01:20:44,676 --> 01:20:46,871
That is sport, my man.

539
01:20:48,679 --> 01:20:50,544
Look. Hum!

540
01:20:52,583 --> 01:20:55,073
Death is never the
end of a story.

541
01:20:55,218 --> 01:20:56,913
There are still traces.

542
01:20:59,355 --> 01:21:01,084
If you want to find
your brother,

543
01:21:01,223 --> 01:21:03,657
you'll have to go back into
your mother's past.

544
01:21:03,759 --> 01:21:06,353
Jean, I'm going to fetch my
sister, that's all.

545
01:21:06,495 --> 01:21:07,427
I'll take care of that.

546
01:21:07,563 --> 01:21:09,757
Two, three small matters
to take care,

547
01:21:09,897 --> 01:21:11,364
then it will take no time.

548
01:21:11,532 --> 01:21:13,261
Well, get your business ready

549
01:21:13,400 --> 01:21:14,662
we should go in ...

550
01:21:14,768 --> 01:21:16,668
My passport ...

551
01:21:16,770 --> 01:21:20,206
"We"? Don't you worry that
you already done enough already

552
01:21:20,339 --> 01:21:23,535
Exactly, this is not the
time to let you down.

553
01:21:25,510 --> 01:21:27,205
Make a man out of you, Simon.

554
01:21:27,345 --> 01:21:29,540
I know that you need me.

555
01:21:32,349 --> 01:21:33,941
We'll get it, then come back.

556
01:21:34,084 --> 01:21:35,449
I promise.

557
01:21:35,586 --> 01:21:37,610
Then, promise, Mr. Marwan,

558
01:21:37,754 --> 01:21:40,917
a notary is on the order
of the sacred.

559
01:24:36,870 --> 01:24:38,997
Sing now.

560
01:25:45,795 --> 01:25:48,160
Gently, gently.

561
01:25:50,298 --> 01:25:51,663
He is coming out.

562
01:25:52,067 --> 01:25:53,466
We can see the head.

563
01:25:53,634 --> 01:25:54,999
Push, push.

564
01:25:55,636 --> 01:25:57,228
Go, girl.

565
01:26:05,577 --> 01:26:07,169
The first came out.

566
01:26:28,130 --> 01:26:31,361
Rest now ...

567
01:26:32,467 --> 01:26:33,832
I'm proud of you.

568
01:26:35,769 --> 01:26:37,794
Get ready for the second.

569
01:27:07,229 --> 01:27:08,491
Stop.

570
01:27:08,730 --> 01:27:10,061
Stop.

571
01:27:11,233 --> 01:27:12,165
What are you doing?

572
01:27:12,501 --> 01:27:14,731
You are going to dump them in the
river as usual.

573
01:27:16,538 --> 01:27:17,834
- It's dangerous.
- No.

574
01:27:17,971 --> 01:27:21,907
You've done your duty.
Throw them in the river.

575
01:27:22,075 --> 01:27:23,702
I want to take care of them.

576
01:27:24,177 --> 01:27:26,737
These are the children of
the woman who sings.

577
01:27:46,729 --> 01:27:49,857
Oh, this country is a war
zone after another, eh!

578
01:27:50,031 --> 01:27:51,089
It's not complicated.

579
01:27:51,233 --> 01:27:53,724
If the notary had existed
at the time of Noah,

580
01:27:53,869 --> 01:27:55,029
we would not be here.

581
01:27:55,170 --> 01:27:57,934
We need only to find the
original contracts.

582
01:27:58,073 --> 01:28:01,701
That's up to you, that's up to you.
And a right of passage there.

583
01:28:01,841 --> 01:28:02,830
And we talk more about it.

584
01:28:02,942 --> 01:28:04,375
Everyone would be happy.

585
01:28:04,544 --> 01:28:07,342
Notaries have existed
only in the last 1,000 years, Simon.

586
01:28:07,447 --> 01:28:09,108
That's the problem.

587
01:28:09,249 --> 01:28:11,376
I should have been here from
the beginning.

588
01:28:11,517 --> 01:28:14,247
Thank you again for your
help, Me Maddad.

589
01:28:14,386 --> 01:28:16,910
The pleasure is all
mine, my dear fellow.

590
01:28:17,054 --> 01:28:18,715
I have the result

591
01:28:18,856 --> 01:28:20,790
that you have requested
via email.

592
01:28:20,924 --> 01:28:23,552
Simon my file on
the seat beside you.

593
01:28:23,693 --> 01:28:26,526
Could you give it to
Lebel, please?

594
01:28:26,630 --> 01:28:29,565
You are very nice, but the
delay and everything ...

595
01:28:29,699 --> 01:28:31,962
I think I'll wait until later.

596
01:28:32,100 --> 01:28:33,294
But I'll summarize.

597
01:28:33,434 --> 01:28:35,061
For the father, it is
rather difficult

598
01:28:35,236 --> 01:28:37,136
because I can not find
the death certificate.

599
01:28:37,272 --> 01:28:38,239
For the brother ...

600
01:28:38,373 --> 01:28:40,238
Excuse me, but what
are we talking about here?

601
01:28:40,408 --> 01:28:42,069
I asked for help, Simon.

602
01:28:42,242 --> 01:28:44,972
Me Maddad kindly gave us a hand

603
01:28:45,112 --> 01:28:46,442
to speed things up.

604
01:28:46,579 --> 01:28:49,878
I told you, Jean,
we came for Jeanne.

605
01:28:51,250 --> 01:28:53,912
Your sister is the one person
in your family

606
01:28:54,085 --> 01:28:55,484
easiest to find.

607
01:29:02,660 --> 01:29:05,128
I'm so glad you're here.

608
01:29:05,261 --> 01:29:07,422
Me too.

609
01:29:13,969 --> 01:29:15,936
OK, that's the nurse's name.

610
01:29:16,103 --> 01:29:17,934
which helped your mother give birth
in prison.

611
01:29:18,072 --> 01:29:19,630
We can go today.

612
01:29:20,641 --> 01:29:22,939
Jeanne, that's enough.

613
01:29:24,811 --> 01:29:26,779
No, you shut up, then follow me.

614
01:29:26,947 --> 01:29:29,847
It's your job to find our
brother, not mine!

615
01:29:29,982 --> 01:29:32,280
Then, if you don't do it for
her or for you,

616
01:29:32,451 --> 01:29:34,146
the, do it for me!

617
01:29:40,325 --> 01:29:42,122
She is at the American hospital.

618
01:29:48,264 --> 01:29:50,027
I'm glad you're here, Jean.

619
01:29:50,166 --> 01:29:52,100
Me too, my owl, me too.

620
01:29:53,169 --> 01:29:55,467
If she is sleeping, you must return
later.

621
01:30:19,890 --> 01:30:21,380
Ms. Maika?

622
01:30:50,143 --> 01:30:53,306
Lebel, Jeanne Marwan,
Simon Marwan.

623
01:30:53,480 --> 01:30:54,845
Bonjour, Madame!

624
01:30:54,981 --> 01:30:56,471
Thank you for having us.

625
01:30:56,649 --> 01:30:59,481
We seek someone you know.

626
01:30:59,617 --> 01:31:01,847
Nawal Marwan, do you know her?

627
01:31:30,010 --> 01:31:32,877
You worked in the Kfar Ryat prison
as a nurse?

628
01:31:47,358 --> 01:31:49,656
She says she knows your mom.

629
01:31:50,861 --> 01:31:53,091
You helped our mother
give birth in prison?

630
01:31:57,699 --> 01:31:59,030
Yes.

631
01:32:05,673 --> 01:32:09,370
Madame, the child we seek is Nawal
Marwan's son that was born in prison.

632
01:32:09,544 --> 01:32:10,943
Can you help us?

633
01:32:14,580 --> 01:32:17,913
She worked in the prison
of Kfar Ryat.

634
01:32:19,051 --> 01:32:21,611
She assisted her
during childbirth.

635
01:32:23,054 --> 01:32:25,045
She gathered the children.

636
01:32:31,862 --> 01:32:34,524
Then she gave them back
to the woman who sings

637
01:32:34,630 --> 01:32:36,564
when she got out of prison.

638
01:32:37,767 --> 01:32:39,894
Nawal Marwan gave
birth to twins.

639
01:32:42,804 --> 01:32:44,271
Hush, hush, hush.

640
01:32:46,373 --> 01:32:48,238
Hush, hush, hush.

641
01:36:54,782 --> 01:36:57,444
You really know the
woman who sings?

642
01:36:57,583 --> 01:37:00,609
You don't know what
it means to me.

643
01:37:01,788 --> 01:37:03,756
Nawal Marwan worked for me

644
01:37:03,856 --> 01:37:05,448
as a secretary for 18 years.

645
01:37:05,591 --> 01:37:07,820
My wife and I, we had
taken a liking

646
01:37:07,958 --> 01:37:09,448
to her and her children.

647
01:37:10,461 --> 01:37:11,792
But I confess that I

648
01:37:11,962 --> 01:37:14,453
didn't really know her till the end.

649
01:37:17,134 --> 01:37:19,295
- Ready?
- Ready.

650
01:37:31,345 --> 01:37:32,835
Hmm ...

651
01:37:34,482 --> 01:37:36,972
Me Maddadi has conducted an
investigation, at my request,

652
01:37:37,150 --> 01:37:40,313
to track your brother
and your father.

653
01:37:45,825 --> 01:37:47,452
For the father, Abu Tarek,

654
01:37:47,560 --> 01:37:50,324
I still have not found
a death certificate.

655
01:37:50,495 --> 01:37:52,621
The country has a lot
of certificates missing.

656
01:37:52,729 --> 01:37:54,959
He could have gone abroad.

657
01:37:55,065 --> 01:37:58,364
That's what happened with
this kind of characters.

658
01:37:58,502 --> 01:37:59,901
They are dead or have disappeared.

659
01:38:00,036 --> 01:38:01,162
You have to see.

660
01:38:01,337 --> 01:38:03,498
Maybe it's better that way.

661
01:38:04,540 --> 01:38:06,905
For the brother ...

662
01:38:07,042 --> 01:38:09,340
your client, Ms. Nawal Marwan,

663
01:38:09,477 --> 01:38:11,342
comes from the village
of Der Om.

664
01:38:11,512 --> 01:38:15,744
She gave the child to a midwife
who's named Elham

665
01:38:15,883 --> 01:38:19,683
who herself returned it to
the orphanage in Kfar Kout

666
01:38:19,854 --> 01:38:22,185
in May 1970.

667
01:38:23,522 --> 01:38:26,389
The main task was to
trace the registry records.

668
01:38:26,525 --> 01:38:29,085
Many documents have been
lost in the war.

669
01:38:30,095 --> 01:38:32,689
But I found the records

670
01:38:32,830 --> 01:38:35,094
which were recovered and donated

671
01:38:35,233 --> 01:38:39,362
by the Sisters of Charity
to the National Archives.

672
01:38:39,502 --> 01:38:43,199
In May 1970, the midwife at
Der Om, Elham

673
01:38:43,372 --> 01:38:46,205
filed a petition for adoption
of a male child.

674
01:38:46,342 --> 01:38:51,005
This is the only boy in the
orphanage filed in that month.

675
01:38:51,112 --> 01:38:52,443
Look.

676
01:38:52,579 --> 01:38:55,742
It was registered under
the name Nihad.

677
01:38:57,584 --> 01:38:59,711
The dates match.

678
01:38:59,853 --> 01:39:01,343
That's him.

679
01:39:02,356 --> 01:39:05,518
Ha! It's your brother! Nihad.

680
01:39:09,060 --> 01:39:11,051
Orphanage Kfar Kout,

681
01:39:11,196 --> 01:39:12,254
Nihad May.

682
01:39:12,397 --> 01:39:15,457
It's his name in the registry.

683
01:39:15,599 --> 01:39:16,793
Nihad from the month of May.

684
01:39:16,934 --> 01:39:19,368
They gave him a temporary name

685
01:39:19,470 --> 01:39:20,800
with the month of arrival.

686
01:39:20,937 --> 01:39:23,963
There was no adoption
during that period.

687
01:39:24,106 --> 01:39:25,903
It was the beginning of the war.

688
01:39:26,074 --> 01:39:28,804
The orphanage was destroyed
four years later.

689
01:39:30,078 --> 01:39:32,740
We must ask those that destroyed
the orphanage in Kfar Kout

690
01:39:32,881 --> 01:39:35,747
to know what happened
to the children.

691
01:39:37,751 --> 01:39:41,414
Between you and me, with what
happened in the region ...

692
01:39:42,422 --> 01:39:43,912
there is not much hope.

693
01:39:45,391 --> 01:39:47,416
They are probably also dead.

694
01:39:47,559 --> 01:39:49,617
I'm not saying they're dead.

695
01:39:49,761 --> 01:39:51,888
I say we lost track of them.

696
01:39:53,598 --> 01:39:55,429
They are both dead.

697
01:39:55,565 --> 01:39:57,999
We open the envelopes,
that's it, then.

698
01:39:58,135 --> 01:39:59,966
That I will not allow, Simon.

699
01:40:00,103 --> 01:40:01,934
This kind of thing is sacred.

700
01:40:05,775 --> 01:40:07,970
Luckily, I have a history.

701
01:40:10,679 --> 01:40:12,772
Excuse me.

702
01:40:14,416 --> 01:40:16,509
It is still worth exploring.

703
01:40:16,650 --> 01:40:19,914
But it is a little radical.

704
01:40:20,954 --> 01:40:21,921
The warlord

705
01:40:22,021 --> 01:40:24,649
that demolished the orphanage
at that time is still alive.

706
01:40:24,791 --> 01:40:26,850
And he may know what happened

707
01:40:26,992 --> 01:40:29,187
to Nihad's children and where
they went.

708
01:40:29,328 --> 01:40:30,522
It's already been an eternity.

709
01:40:30,662 --> 01:40:32,323
You must understand

710
01:40:32,464 --> 01:40:35,660
that during this period there were
a series of reprisals

711
01:40:35,800 --> 01:40:39,327
which fit one another in
a sort of inexorable logic,

712
01:40:43,306 --> 01:40:45,274
A warlord is exactly

713
01:40:45,375 --> 01:40:47,536
the type of man who
has a long memory.

714
01:40:47,677 --> 01:40:50,008
And he will remember, believe me.

715
01:40:51,446 --> 01:40:53,277
Wallat Chamseddine,

716
01:40:53,381 --> 01:40:54,814
is his name.

717
01:40:59,119 --> 01:41:00,484
We can find him here?

718
01:41:00,620 --> 01:41:03,611
If we don't find him, he
will find us.

719
01:41:06,492 --> 01:41:08,517
But we can try something.

720
01:41:10,362 --> 01:41:13,024
Would you like tea, Mr. Marwan?

721
01:41:17,035 --> 01:41:19,002
It's your turn.

722
01:41:22,472 --> 01:41:24,201
You will go

723
01:41:24,340 --> 01:41:26,331
to the Deressa refugee camp.

724
01:41:26,509 --> 01:41:27,976
You will come to tea

725
01:41:28,077 --> 01:41:29,339
anywhere in the camp

726
01:41:29,512 --> 01:41:31,377
with the person that invite you.

727
01:41:31,513 --> 01:41:34,504
And you say you are the son
of the woman who sings

728
01:41:34,648 --> 01:41:36,513
and are looking Nihad May.

729
01:41:36,684 --> 01:41:38,811
You can not go there alone.

730
01:41:40,087 --> 01:41:42,180
I'll find someone

731
01:41:42,322 --> 01:41:43,846
to accompany you.

732
01:42:05,941 --> 01:42:07,704
Welcome to Deressa.

733
01:43:16,266 --> 01:43:18,097
Ha! Ha! You know where you
are going, Simon?

734
01:43:18,268 --> 01:43:19,667
I know.

735
01:43:46,025 --> 01:43:47,253
How are you?

736
01:43:48,594 --> 01:43:50,084
In the name of God, you've grown!

737
01:43:50,262 --> 01:43:53,026
I have finished my engineering studies.

738
01:43:53,198 --> 01:43:57,828
I cannot find work, so I'm
a taxi driver now.

739
01:43:58,002 --> 01:44:00,027
What brings you here?

740
01:44:00,203 --> 01:44:05,266
I am with some foreign visitors, who
asked me to bring them here.

741
01:44:07,144 --> 01:44:09,009
Welcome, come.

742
01:44:09,178 --> 01:44:11,510
No, thank you, we're
in a hurry.

743
01:44:11,680 --> 01:44:13,511
Please, come.

744
01:44:18,819 --> 01:44:21,549
He is inviting us to tea.

745
01:44:21,688 --> 01:44:22,814
Oh, good!

746
01:44:40,037 --> 01:44:43,871
Uh, I wonder why you have
come to Deressa.

747
01:44:47,010 --> 01:44:49,501
I am looking for someone
named Nihad de Mai.

748
01:44:58,854 --> 01:45:01,845
He does not know Nihad de Mai.

749
01:45:01,988 --> 01:45:05,185
He asks me what are your names.

750
01:45:12,531 --> 01:45:15,363
My mother comes from the village
of Der de Om, in the South.

751
01:45:28,611 --> 01:45:30,704
My mother is the woman who sings.

752
01:45:56,101 --> 01:45:58,193
Yes, that's fine. Done.

753
01:46:03,374 --> 01:46:04,932
Wait for what?

754
01:46:38,270 --> 01:46:40,238
- Sarwan Marwan?
- Yes.

755
01:46:40,338 --> 01:46:42,669
We are here to offer help.

756
01:46:42,806 --> 01:46:45,104
You will be back in an hour.

757
01:46:46,342 --> 01:46:47,832
Can I tell my sister?

758
01:46:47,977 --> 01:46:51,003
No, you'll be back in
an hour, I promise.

759
01:46:52,482 --> 01:46:54,950
I'll put on a shirt, just a second.

760
01:46:57,752 --> 01:46:58,946
He will call.

761
01:46:59,320 --> 01:47:00,685
He's going to go.

762
01:47:01,355 --> 01:47:04,188
Ok! Do not worry, you can follow.

763
01:47:04,325 --> 01:47:07,761
Ah, I told you: the South,
a spark and it exploded.

764
01:47:07,961 --> 01:47:09,360
Oh, okay.

765
01:48:23,591 --> 01:48:26,855
You have been luck with us,
we'll help in our own way.

766
01:48:28,228 --> 01:48:29,752
You must leave the country.

767
01:48:29,930 --> 01:48:31,659
It'll be easier.

768
01:48:31,831 --> 01:48:34,265
We will find you a house and a job.

769
01:48:35,201 --> 01:48:38,193
I want your life to be better.

770
01:48:40,005 --> 01:48:42,768
We have many contacts
in America.

771
01:48:44,575 --> 01:48:46,770
You gotta go with your children.

772
01:48:47,378 --> 01:48:50,211
I know they are alive.
Take them with you.

773
01:48:53,383 --> 01:48:57,045
The children will help
you, you'll see.

774
01:49:03,858 --> 01:49:06,793
You cannot ask me.

775
01:49:08,629 --> 01:49:10,926
Your children are our
children, Nawal.

776
01:49:11,097 --> 01:49:13,224
Your family is our family.

777
01:49:13,732 --> 01:49:14,926
Trust me.

778
01:49:16,368 --> 01:49:19,303
I'll help you.

779
01:49:19,471 --> 01:49:22,804
I'm here for you and
your children.

780
01:50:12,315 --> 01:50:13,805
Hello, Sarwan.

781
01:50:15,952 --> 01:50:19,615
Excuse my introduction, but
it is for your protection.

782
01:50:21,790 --> 01:50:24,690
They call me Wallat Chamseddine.

783
01:50:27,093 --> 01:50:31,427
Tell me, what can I do to
help, Sarwan Marwan?

784
01:50:33,166 --> 01:50:34,929
You knew my mother.

785
01:50:35,035 --> 01:50:37,663
They say she worked for me.

786
01:50:37,803 --> 01:50:40,828
What can I do to help?

787
01:50:44,809 --> 01:50:48,142
I am looking for a
man named Nihad de Mai.

788
01:50:49,179 --> 01:50:51,306
Why you are looking for Nihad de Mai?

789
01:50:53,316 --> 01:50:54,374
He's my brother.

790
01:50:54,517 --> 01:50:57,008
My mother asked me to find him.

791
01:50:58,720 --> 01:51:00,551
And how can you prove that

792
01:51:00,689 --> 01:51:03,715
Nihad de Mai is the son
of Nawal Marwan?

793
01:51:06,495 --> 01:51:08,291
My brother was
placed for adoption

794
01:51:08,395 --> 01:51:10,158
at the Kfar Kout orphanage.

795
01:51:11,498 --> 01:51:14,467
We found the registry with
the original file.

796
01:51:15,468 --> 01:51:17,129
The dates ... Everything fits.

797
01:51:17,237 --> 01:51:19,467
Nihad de Mai is my brother.

798
01:52:02,707 --> 01:52:04,766
Me and my friends, we attacked

799
01:52:04,910 --> 01:52:07,241
the christian village at Kfar Kout ...

800
01:52:08,245 --> 01:52:09,712
In response to attacks

801
01:52:09,880 --> 01:52:12,713
that our brothers, the refugees,
were victims of.

802
01:52:14,350 --> 01:52:17,444
There was an orphanage
in Kfar Kout.

803
01:52:18,521 --> 01:52:20,580
I saved the children.

804
01:52:20,723 --> 01:52:22,849
I took them with us.

805
01:52:22,957 --> 01:52:25,858
And Nihad was among them.

806
01:52:25,960 --> 01:52:27,894
We have trained and prepared

807
01:52:28,062 --> 01:52:30,257
them so that they can fight
alongside us.

808
01:52:31,465 --> 01:52:33,729
Nihad, he had a gift.

809
01:52:33,900 --> 01:52:36,391
He was at unique.

810
01:52:36,569 --> 01:52:39,732
And soon it became a
formidable fencer.

811
01:52:41,040 --> 01:52:45,568
But he wanted to
find her mother.

812
01:52:45,743 --> 01:52:47,711
He sought her for a long time.

813
01:52:49,147 --> 01:52:52,411
Nihad, I do not know what
he saw or heard.

814
01:52:53,417 --> 01:52:54,907
He started ...

815
01:52:56,085 --> 01:52:58,417
a crazy war.

816
01:52:58,588 --> 01:53:02,490
He came to see me, he
wanted to be a martyr

817
01:53:02,625 --> 01:53:05,093
so that his mother should see
his picture everywhere

818
01:53:05,260 --> 01:53:06,556
on the walls around the country.

819
01:53:07,795 --> 01:53:09,422
But I refused.

820
01:53:11,332 --> 01:53:13,323
He went back to Daresh.

821
01:53:14,401 --> 01:53:16,562
He became a maverick,

822
01:53:16,669 --> 01:53:18,933
one of the most dangerous in the region.

823
01:53:19,105 --> 01:53:20,299
A real machine.

824
01:53:20,440 --> 01:53:22,304
He pulls on everyone.

825
01:53:22,441 --> 01:53:26,844
And then there was the
enemy invasion.

826
01:53:28,245 --> 01:53:29,735
And one morning ...

827
01:53:30,748 --> 01:53:32,682
They captured Nihad.

828
01:53:32,817 --> 01:53:34,614
He killed seven gunmen.

829
01:53:36,685 --> 01:53:38,448
They did not killed them.

830
01:53:38,587 --> 01:53:39,952
They captured him

831
01:53:40,089 --> 01:53:42,785
and sent him to the prison
in Kfar Ryat.

832
01:53:44,159 --> 01:53:45,854
He has been in prison?

833
01:53:45,995 --> 01:53:47,462
Yes.

834
01:53:49,831 --> 01:53:51,263
He is the executioner.

835
01:53:53,433 --> 01:53:55,333
He worked with my father?

836
01:53:55,469 --> 01:53:57,437
- No, he did not work

837
01:53:57,536 --> 01:53:59,470
with Abu Tarek, your father.

838
01:54:28,497 --> 01:54:29,964
- Are you okay?

839
01:54:34,634 --> 01:54:36,124
One plus one ...

840
01:54:37,137 --> 01:54:39,002
that makes two.

841
01:54:39,139 --> 01:54:40,629
What?

842
01:54:43,676 --> 01:54:45,735
One plus one makes two.

843
01:54:46,745 --> 01:54:48,235
You can not make one.

844
01:54:54,851 --> 01:54:56,648
Hey, you have a fever.

845
01:54:59,056 --> 01:55:00,546
Jeanne?

846
01:55:02,425 --> 01:55:05,052
One plus one, does it make one?

847
01:55:26,712 --> 01:55:28,577
Are there are empty seats, no.

848
01:55:28,714 --> 01:55:30,045
Oh, move ahead if you want.

849
01:56:58,822 --> 01:57:01,188
Can I help you, ma'am?

850
01:57:09,330 --> 01:57:11,298
Excuse me.

851
01:58:21,657 --> 01:58:24,023
<i>By becoming a hangman</i>

852
01:58:24,160 --> 01:58:26,651
<i>your brother has changed
its name.</i>

853
01:58:26,762 --> 01:58:29,322
<i>He became Abu Tarek.</i>

854
01:58:32,233 --> 01:58:35,202
<i>Nihad de Mai is Abu Tarek.</i>

855
01:58:39,440 --> 01:58:41,908
<i>We know that he now lives in Canada</i>

856
01:58:42,041 --> 01:58:44,066
<i>under a new identity.</i>

857
01:58:44,210 --> 01:58:46,700
<i>Nihad Harmanni.</i>

858
01:59:25,211 --> 01:59:26,701
Mr. Harmanni?

859
01:59:29,948 --> 01:59:30,915
Yes?

860
01:59:38,422 --> 01:59:39,912
This is for you.

861
02:00:25,929 --> 02:00:28,625
<i>My hand is shaking while
I am writing this.</i>

862
02:00:28,797 --> 02:00:30,355
<i>I recognized you.</i>

863
02:00:30,498 --> 02:00:33,126
<i>But you didn't.</i>

864
02:00:33,301 --> 02:00:35,166
<i>It's a wonderful miracle.</i>

865
02:00:35,303 --> 02:00:36,964
<i>I'm your number 72.</i>

866
02:00:37,105 --> 02:00:41,371
<i>This letter will be delivered
by our children.</i>

867
02:00:41,508 --> 02:00:43,498
<i>You will not recognize them</i>

868
02:00:43,643 --> 02:00:45,474
<i>because they are beautiful,</i>

869
02:00:45,645 --> 02:00:47,977
<i>but they know who you are.</i>

870
02:00:56,655 --> 02:00:58,884
<i>Through them, I want to tell you</i>

871
02:00:59,022 --> 02:01:00,990
<i>you're still alive.</i>

872
02:01:01,157 --> 02:01:03,148
<i>But soon, you'll be quiet.</i>

873
02:01:03,326 --> 02:01:04,816
<i>I know.</i>

874
02:01:06,162 --> 02:01:08,824
<i>Because silence is
all to the truth.</i>

875
02:01:09,832 --> 02:01:12,892
<i>Signed: The whore 72.</i>

876
02:01:26,546 --> 02:01:29,207
<i>I speak to my son.</i>

877
02:01:29,348 --> 02:01:31,373
<i>I am not talking to
the executioner.</i>

878
02:01:31,516 --> 02:01:34,485
<i>Whatever happens, I will
always love you.</i>

879
02:01:34,586 --> 02:01:39,819
<i>That's the promise I made you
at birth, my son.</i>

880
02:01:39,924 --> 02:01:43,188
<i>Whatever happens, I will
always love you.</i>

881
02:01:44,327 --> 02:01:46,727
<i>I've searched my whole life.</i>

882
02:01:46,863 --> 02:01:49,354
<i>I found you.</i>

883
02:01:49,499 --> 02:01:53,026
<i>You, you could not recognize me.</i>

884
02:01:53,201 --> 02:01:55,999
<i>You have your tattoo
on the right heel.</i>

885
02:01:56,104 --> 02:01:57,502
<i>I've seen it.</i>

886
02:01:57,605 --> 02:01:58,663
<i>I recognized you.</i>

887
02:02:00,174 --> 02:02:02,608
<i>And I found you beautiful.</i>

888
02:02:02,742 --> 02:02:06,109
<i>I'll remember you with all the
sweetness of the world, my love.</i>

889
02:02:06,246 --> 02:02:09,738
<i>Console yourself because nothing
is more beautiful</i>

890
02:02:09,883 --> 02:02:11,544
<i>than being together.</i>

891
02:02:11,718 --> 02:02:13,378
<i>You were born of love.</i>

892
02:02:13,518 --> 02:02:17,852
<i>Your brother and your sister
were also born of love.</i>

893
02:02:19,524 --> 02:02:22,891
<i>Nothing is more beautiful
than to be together.</i>

894
02:02:23,060 --> 02:02:26,052
<i>Your mother, Nawal Marwan.</i>

895
02:02:27,063 --> 02:02:29,429
<i>Prisoner number 72.</i>

896
02:02:37,739 --> 02:02:39,798

02:03:21,275 --> 02:03:23,470
<i>Then she starts in horror.</i>

907
02:03:24,679 --> 02:03:27,806
<i>At the birth of your father?</i>

908
02:03:27,947 --> 02:03:31,144
<i>Then she begins a
great love story.</i>

909
02:03:33,185 --> 02:03:36,677
<i>I say that your story
begins with a promise</i>

910
02:03:36,821 --> 02:03:39,255
<i>that will break
the thread of anger.</i>

911
02:03:41,125 --> 02:03:44,458
<i>Thanks to you, today I finally
managed to do it.</i>

912
02:03:44,628 --> 02:03:46,596
<i>The thread is broken.</i>

913
02:03:46,697 --> 02:03:49,632
<i>And I can finally take
the time to rock you in my arms...</i>

914
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:53,161
and softly sing you a lullaby

915
02:03:53,302 --> 02:03:55,167
<i>to comfort you.</i>

916
02:03:55,303 --> 02:03:57,931
<i>Nothing is more beautiful
than to be together.</i>

917
02:03:59,807 --> 02:04:01,297
<i>I love you.</i>

918
02:04:02,676 --> 02:04:05,839
<i>Your mother, Nawal.</i>
