1
00:00:34,617 --> 00:00:36,744
Every man carries a badge.

2
00:00:37,912 --> 00:00:40,205
Some symbol of his allegiance.

3
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:46,920
His were the scars of a boxer who'd used his
fists to climb the social ladder of the mob.

4
00:00:48,339 --> 00:00:52,843
A Jew who'd gained the respect of wops
through a homicidal lust.

5
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,138
He'd sworn an oath of violence.

6
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:57,931
And his master?

7
00:00:58,099 --> 00:01:00,809
His own insatiable will to power.

8
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:02,936
He wanted to own this town.

9
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:09,359
His name is Mickey Cohen.

10
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:19,203
On my badge is the city of Los Angeles.

11
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:22,498
I came back from the war
and I didn't even recognize it.

12
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:27,753
Brothels, vice, blood in the streets.

13
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:30,172
Cohen is building his empire.

14
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,257
"The children of the night.

15
00:01:33,676 --> 00:01:35,385
What music they make."

16
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:39,223
It's the damnedest thing, Russo.

17
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:41,058
I come up here so many times...

18
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:44,269
they see me,
they know they're getting a treat.

19
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:47,940
What's the matter with you? You think they're
not gonna hear about this in Chicago?

20
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:49,399
Oh, I'll make sure they do.

21
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:50,859
You're certifiable, Mickey.

22
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:54,780
You belong in a booby hatch,
eating pudding in your goddamn pajamas.

23
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:57,241
A minute ago, you were begging.

24
00:01:57,408 --> 00:01:59,284
That's when I thought you were a man.

25
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:01,870
But you're something else.
You're rotten.

26
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:09,586
What about now, Tommy?

27
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:11,588
You impressed?

28
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:14,049
You prick bastard.

29
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:16,718
- Okay, boys.
- You sick son of a bitch.

30
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:17,886
Let her rip!

31
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,809
Oh, my.

32
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:28,063
Now, you go back to Chicago...

33
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:31,066
you tell them what you saw here tonight.

34
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:36,655
You tell them that Los Angeles
belongs to Mickey Cohen.

35
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:44,413
Fighting the war had taught me...

36
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:49,960
the only thing necessary for the triumph
of evil is for good men to do nothing.

37
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:53,589
People are scared.
They say leave it alone.

38
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:55,257
Excuse me, miss?

39
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:58,051
Anyone ever tell you you look like
Lauren Bacall?

40
00:02:58,219 --> 00:02:59,219
No.

41
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:01,722
But Cohen isn't the only fighter.

42
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,849
And I'm ready to step in the ring.

43
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,311
Son of a bitch didn't waste any time,
did he?

44
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:09,646
Today's your lucky day.
We're holding auditions.

45
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:11,899
- Really?
- Let's go.

46
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:17,779
This is it.

47
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:18,947
This is wonderful.

48
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:21,658
Thank you. I can't wait to let
my folks know about this.

49
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:23,493
They're gonna be real proud of you.

50
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:26,038
You know, this is where
Bacall first met Bogart.

51
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:28,290
What the hell are you doing?

52
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:31,293
What's it look like? He's gonna
give her a bad time in there.

53
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:34,880
O'Mara, for chrissakes, that's Cohen's
place. Nobody goes in there.

54
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,840
I don't want any part of this.

55
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:38,425
Go get an ice cream.

56
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:47,142
Right this way.

57
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:52,064
You know, we hold all our screen tests
up here, kiddo.

58
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:54,608
Away from the crowds.

59
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:56,068
Come on.

60
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,032
- Help you with something, pal?
- Looking to meet someone.

61
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,034
Yeah? What's her name?

62
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:08,205
I don't know, I thought maybe you
could help me out with that.

63
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:13,585
- No, mister. It's okay, really.
- Get in the goddamn room.

64
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:15,462
- Look at what Daddy found.
- Nice.

65
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:19,758
I tell you I was partial to blonds?

66
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:23,428
Yeah, yeah, yeah. All right, big guy.
Pistola, butt-first.

67
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,265
You're a cop?

68
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:28,725
Christ, buddy. What are you,
soft in the head?

69
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:39,945
Please! Let me go! Please!

70
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,500
- Break her, boys.
- Let me go!

71
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:57,629
No! No! Stop it, please! Don't!
Please! Please!

72
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:01,174
Help!

73
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:04,386
You make another sound and you're dead.

74
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:13,687
Who is it?

75
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:16,815
Mitts in the air!

76
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,650
Come on!

77
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,527
I don't think so.

78
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:24,114
- Ten bucks says this guy ain't even heeled.
- I'll take that bet.

79
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:27,075
Why don't you come over here
and find out. Come on.

80
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:30,912
Bang.

81
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:43,050
Help! Somebody!

82
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:02,110
Please help me!

83
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,032
Welcome to Los Angeles, ma'am.

84
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:13,163
Patty, it was the strangest thing.

85
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:17,459
I arrested Whalen, next thing you know,
lickety-split, he escapes.

86
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:19,795
Oh, really? He overpowered you again?

87
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:22,756
- No.
- He just slipped his cuffs?

88
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:25,550
He sure did. It was the damnedest thing.

89
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,260
Keep moving.

90
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:30,806
What happened to you this time?

91
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:31,973
He resisted.

92
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:33,850
Oh, yeah? What happened to them?

93
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:35,352
They resisted.

94
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,312
You're working too hard.

95
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:41,358
Boys.

96
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:45,112
O'Mara! Get your Irish ass in here!

97
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:52,494
Weren't you told to stay away
from Cohen's turf?

98
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:53,745
I was.

99
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:56,581
Hendricks told me you walked in there
without a warrant.

100
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:58,834
- These three are gonna walk.
- Says who?

101
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:01,545
Says Judge Carter.

102
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:07,259
Habeas corpus. Well, that's fast work.

103
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:10,512
I didn't know any better, I'd think
someone here stiffed in a call.

104
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,849
Listen to me, we got rules
around here, smartass.

105
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:16,726
Do yourself a favor: Learn them.

106
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:20,605
Is that how you got that new Packard
out there in the parking lot?

107
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:22,399
Following the rules, boss?

108
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:25,360
Two things you can't take back
on this job, kid:

109
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:28,697
Bullets out of your gun
and words out of your mouth.

110
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:30,782
That it?

111
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:32,701
Get out.

112
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:46,298
Karl Lockwood.

113
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:48,425
That's Mickey's bodyguard.

114
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:51,845
I'm sure I'm not the first person
to tell you this...

115
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:55,223
but don't feed or tease the animals.

116
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:58,018
Doesn't it bother you?

117
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,021
No.

118
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:06,318
Not for a long time.

119
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:10,655
Okay, stay out of trouble.

120
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:24,169
Connie, look...

121
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:27,380
- Baby, you promised me.
- I know.

122
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:30,717
You stood right where you're standing
now and you promised me.

123
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:32,135
I know.

124
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:43,355
I didn't go looking for it. Scout's honor.

125
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:47,108
John, you go looking for it every time
you leave the house.

126
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,575
What happened this time?

127
00:08:57,161 --> 00:08:59,412
Oh, it was just some pimp.

128
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:05,293
He was gonna put the hurt on this poor
girl who didn't know any better.

129
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:07,546
She looked a little like you.

130
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:10,298
I mean, not nearly as pretty, but...

131
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:15,303
Smooth talk isn't your line, sarge.

132
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:20,642
Look, I don't mind living like
Ma and Pa Kettle.

133
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,811
I don't need a new pair
of shoes every week.

134
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:24,729
I married an honest cop.

135
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:29,901
You're kind, you don't talk too much,
you're a demon in the sack.

136
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:34,364
But I don't need a hero, sarge,
I need a husband.

137
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:38,243
So you do not have permission
to go belly-flop on a grenade.

138
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,662
Not when we're expecting company.
Do you read me?

139
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:43,623
Yeah.

140
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:58,555
Whores don't grow on trees.

141
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:01,516
They're like mustangs.
You gotta catch them wild...

142
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:04,561
and break them before you train them
to do tricks.

143
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:10,609
Means I need a quiet place where I can
keep the girls locked up.

144
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:13,653
Keep them hopped up on Mexican dope.

145
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,239
Watch your jacket, it's filthy here.

146
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:19,534
But this cop comes out of nowhere
like an early frost.

147
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:27,167
And now my whole crop of cunt
is ruined.

148
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:30,629
Mr. Cohen, I swear to God...

149
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:35,091
You're talking to God, Mitch,
so you might as well swear to me.

150
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:41,806
I swear, if it hadn't been for that cop,
this would have never happened.

151
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:44,392
You think I'm sore about that cop?
Hell no.

152
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,186
He's a square Joe, the guy.

153
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:50,148
Rescues a damsel in distress.

154
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:53,443
Goddamn hero is what he is.
They should put a medal on him.

155
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,740
We're gonna have to find a whole
new place. Start over again.

156
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:00,700
It's like they say:

157
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:05,955
"All good things must one day be burnt
to the ground for the insurance money."

158
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,210
Mr. Cohen, thank you so much.

159
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:12,712
I swear it won't ever happen again.

160
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,381
I know it won't, kid.

161
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:17,550
Karl, what are you doing?

162
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:18,843
Let us out of here!

163
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:43,243
Hey!

164
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:45,954
Hey, Jerry. Want a shine?

165
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:48,832
Hey, Pete, you want a shiner? Go to bed.

166
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:50,875
Come on, I'm a working man just like you.

167
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:53,837
How many times I gotta tell you?
When it gets dark, go home.

168
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:57,632
I'd love to, but I gotta make just
one more buck before I can get out of here.

169
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,051
- If I give you a dollar, will you go home?
- Yeah.

170
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:01,511
- Do you promise?
- I promise.

171
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:02,804
Beat it.

172
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:05,348
Shine? Want a shine?

173
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,395
Go ahead, detective.

174
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,359
- Hey, sugar.
- Hey, Jerry.

175
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:20,989
Here comes Mr. Five By Five

176
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:22,657
Ladies.

177
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:27,078
Solid avoirdupois

178
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:30,915
Mr. Five By Five

179
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:35,044
He's 5 feet tall and he's 5 feet wide

180
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:38,882
He don't measure no more from head to toe

181
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:41,760
Than he do from side to side

182
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:44,387
Mr. Five By Five

183
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:47,056
Jack. Fancy seeing you here.

184
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:48,600
Fancy that.

185
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:50,769
You look sharp.

186
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:53,271
- Take a pew.
- Yeah, okay.

187
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,190
How's it going, pal?

188
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:58,193
You got a steak à la carte back there
with your name on it.

189
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,402
You're a peach.

190
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:01,571
Figure you must be starving.

191
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:04,199
You haven't picked a winner in what,
six weeks?

192
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:06,993
- Five.
- My boss can help you out with that.

193
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:11,289
You know we fix the damn races, right?
All you gotta do is ask me.

194
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,625
First, Jack, you're not allowed
to tell me that.

195
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:17,295
Second of all, you know I have
a warrant for your arrest, right?

196
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:19,589
- So, what's the charge?
- Usury.

197
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:21,549
What the hell is usury?

198
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:23,760
Loansharking.
Do you want me to pull it out?

199
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:25,887
- It's in my pocket.
- Keep it in your pants.

200
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:29,015
- I can read it and tell you exactly what it's for.
- It's fine.

201
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:33,144
- Jerry, can you listen to me for a second?
- Yeah, I'm listening.

202
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:35,605
- Cohen's on the warpath.
- Warpath?

203
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,860
Looks like he's on the
"give me some more" path.

204
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:46,032
- Just keep your eyes on the players, Jerry.
- Hard to know the players without the playbill.

205
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:48,576
Okay.

206
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:50,453
Up top you got the killer.

207
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:52,163
Wrevock's his name.

208
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:54,791
And down below,
the Honorable Judge Carter.

209
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,085
Max Solomon, Cohen's lawyer.

210
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:59,879
And Burbank Police Chief
Elmer Jackson.

211
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:03,424
On this side of the table,
one Eugene W. Biscailuz...

212
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:05,593
the high sheriff of Los Angeles County.

213
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:15,186
Who's the tomato?

214
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:18,690
That's Grace Faraday,
Cohen's etiquette tutor.

215
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:21,067
- Is that right?
- He's getting all sophisticated.

216
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:23,736
- Oh, must be nice.
- What's that?

217
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:26,197
I haven't been sophisticated in weeks.

218
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,576
And it's not for lack of trying.

219
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:33,079
Roast peacock.

220
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:37,876
Romans couldn't get enough
of this stuff. The guys had class.

221
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,919
It's the other fork, darling.

222
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:45,008
Tonight...

223
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:49,304
we're celebrating the birth
of a new city...

224
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:53,766
built right here on the ruins of
Los Angeles.

225
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:56,269
- Congratulations, Mickey.
- Hear, hear.

226
00:14:56,937 --> 00:14:58,980
- Cheers.
- Hear, hear.

227
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:05,904
I think I'll just have a cigarette.

228
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,032
Don't worry about it.

229
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:11,409
It's done.

230
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:15,788
Don't even think about it, Jerry.

231
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:18,541
The penalty for poaching
the king's deer in this town...

232
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:20,877
is still a permanent vacation
in a pine box.

233
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,214
Well, you gotta die of something.

234
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:27,717
Will you excuse me?

235
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:38,603
Thanks.

236
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:40,438
Sure.

237
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:46,235
I'm Jerry.

238
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:50,448
Say, Jerry, I bet you got a ducky
war story behind that lighter.

239
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:52,617
Yeah, sure, I got stories.

240
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:56,371
- Hey, Mac, can I get a Dirty Shirley?
- Coming up.

241
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:59,374
I got shot down once over the Pacific.

242
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:05,171
I spent the night hanging on to the wing of the
plane, sharks bumping my legs in the dark.

243
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:06,798
Are you weak in the knees yet?

244
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:08,925
Sure, I am.

245
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:13,304
Let's see. You're not quite big enough
to be a shylock.

246
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:14,597
I give up.

247
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:16,849
What's your racket, handsome?

248
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:19,936
Mostly I just like to play games.

249
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:21,688
I bet. What kind of games?

250
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:23,940
I like to play Post Office.

251
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:26,901
Post Office? It's a kid's game.

252
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:28,945
Not the way I play it.

253
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,825
But my racket is I'm a Bible salesman.

254
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:37,662
You wanna take me away from all this
and make an honest woman out of me?

255
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:38,955
No, ma'am.

256
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:42,125
I was just hoping to take you to bed.

257
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:51,968
Chief! Chief, what do you think about
those girls locked up at the Croesus?

258
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:54,095
Rumor has it that was Mickey Cohen's place.

259
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:56,055
When you gonna do something
about Cohen?

260
00:16:56,223 --> 00:16:58,599
- Chief has no comment.
- Hey.

261
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:01,310
Well, who's running this town, then?

262
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:02,812
Who took it down?

263
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,106
John O'Mara. Homicide.

264
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,234
Just one man did that?

265
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:09,652
Yes, sir.

266
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,870
Sergeant O'Mara, Daryl Gates.

267
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,580
Who the hell is Daryl Gates?

268
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:22,457
The chief's driver.

269
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,168
He'd like a word with you, sergeant.

270
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:32,216
Officer Gates, kill the fatted calf,
will you?

271
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,386
I've found my prodigal son.

272
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:37,430
Two Purple Hearts.

273
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:40,016
Silver Star.

274
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:42,351
Trained at Camp X?

275
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:44,729
I never heard of Camp X, sir.

276
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,773
Of course not.

277
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:49,817
But you are skilled in guerilla warfare.

278
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:52,945
All due respect, sir,
may I ask why I'm here?

279
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:55,073
Would you please have a seat,
sergeant?

280
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:59,535
I want to talk to you about the war...

281
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:02,538
for the soul of Los Angeles.

282
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:09,003
You see, our forbearers fought
savage Indians and Mexican bandits...

283
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:11,339
to win Los Angeles.

284
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:16,219
And now, we're losing her to an
Eastern crook.

285
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:19,305
No one will testify.

286
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:22,892
They know it's suicide.

287
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:25,770
This isn't a crime wave.

288
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:31,234
It's enemy occupation, and you've
fought in occupied territory before.

289
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:33,194
I have.

290
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:35,488
I need you to do it again.

291
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:40,284
To wage guerilla war against
Mickey Cohen.

292
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:42,578
We're finally going after him.

293
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:43,788
I'll need men.

294
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:46,457
Recruit them. And keep it quiet.

295
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,459
You're off the books.

296
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:51,295
You are to make no arrests.

297
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:54,090
- You want me to kill him?
- No.

298
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:56,175
With Cohen dead...

299
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:59,804
his empire would only attract
others of his kind.

300
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:04,142
I want you to shatter his operations...

301
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:07,103
destroy his establishments...

302
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:11,149
and drive that bastard out of this city.

303
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:13,067
Yes, sir.

304
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:25,663
What are those?

305
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,335
I'm supposed to recruit a few guys
for this new outfit.

306
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:32,670
Oh, yeah?

307
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:34,463
What kind of outfit?

308
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:37,842
A small squad. Five, maybe six guys.

309
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:41,929
What kind of outfit?

310
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:47,393
We're going after Mickey Cohen.

311
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,411
Oh, Connie, Jesus.

312
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:09,248
We moved out here, you said we'd found
paradise, remember?

313
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:14,128
Wind was right, you could smell
the ocean right through that window.

314
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:19,425
That's exactly what kept me going when I
was over there, was raising a family here.

315
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:22,929
You can't ask me to just hand it
all over to Mickey Cohen.

316
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:24,639
Mickey Cohen can have I.A., John.

317
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:27,642
As far as I'm concerned,
he's welcome to the whole lousy town.

318
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:28,935
He just can't have you.

319
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:35,024
Sweetheart, look.

320
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:38,110
The war is over.

321
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:41,697
Stop fighting.

322
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:44,325
Come back to me.

323
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:47,036
I'm trying.

324
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,580
I need your help.

325
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:01,384
Hey, come here for a second,
I want to ask you something.

326
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:05,972
Well, you see, the thing is...

327
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:12,645
I bet you say that to all the girls.

328
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:13,896
I don't...

329
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:19,443
know what you're talking about.

330
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:25,491
Where have you been all
my miserable life...

331
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:30,162
Jerry the Bible salesman?

332
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,292
Drinking.

333
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:38,671
That's a noble profession.

334
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:52,852
He'll kill you if he finds out, you know.

335
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:56,272
Who?

336
00:21:58,442 --> 00:21:59,692
Mickey.

337
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:05,906
Mickey Mouse?

338
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:12,663
What are you doing
with that knucklehead, anyway?

339
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:15,583
Doesn't really seem like your type.

340
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:20,629
I'm his type.

341
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:23,841
That's what matters.

342
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,733
You are something else, you know that?

343
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:41,984
Yeah.

344
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:47,698
Top of his class. Top of his class.

345
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:51,619
This one made detective before his
30th birthday.

346
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:55,664
If I'm Cohen, these are the cops
I'm gonna buy.

347
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:58,084
They'll be lieutenants in a few years.

348
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:01,837
So I should just find other bums
like me?

349
00:23:02,005 --> 00:23:06,050
I'm just saying that you shouldn't be
looking at choir boys for this.

350
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:17,686
I'm putting a squad together.

351
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:21,315
I need an Indian guide
who knows the territory.

352
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:25,986
I wish I could help. I'm just in the middle
of a very important case, so I can't.

353
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:29,156
Who's the lucky winner this time?

354
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:37,164
Well, good luck.

355
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:38,499
That's all you got?

356
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:41,168
Sarge, the whole town's underwater...

357
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:45,631
and you're grabbing a bucket when you
should grab a bathing suit, you know?

358
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:48,092
Come on, Jerry,
what the hell happened to you?

359
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:49,885
Hey...

360
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:52,263
same thing that happened to you, pal.

361
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:56,267
But the war's over
and we don't have to fight anymore.

362
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:59,520
You're not gonna change anything
around here, sarge.

363
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:02,982
You're just gonna wake up one morning
on the wrong side of the grass.

364
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:04,275
For what?

365
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:08,737
If you can't answer that question,
take off the badge.

366
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:14,827
Drink up.

367
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:20,541
Okay, but only because it sounded
like an order.

368
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:24,795
How about this guy? They call him
The Sheriff of Central Avenue.

369
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:26,380
Coleman Harris.

370
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:29,008
Excessive force and insubordination.

371
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:31,552
Sounds like a man
after your own dear heart.

372
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:43,689
It's okay, Del.

373
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:45,816
Now, don't wiggle it.

374
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:47,818
Be best you pull it straight out.

375
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:53,073
Lieutenant. Sergeant John O'Mara.

376
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:55,201
Can I buy you a drink?

377
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:58,037
Well, seeing as though I'm still on duty...

378
00:24:58,205 --> 00:24:59,663
you better buy me two.

379
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:09,006
Damn heroin, eating Central Avenue
down to the bone.

380
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:13,636
I lost my niece to it a year ago.

381
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:18,015
I'm the only law that there is down here.

382
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:20,935
What would you say if I took you upriver?

383
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:23,145
All the way to the headwaters.

384
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:24,438
No more pushers.

385
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:26,607
Plug it up right at the source.

386
00:25:30,445 --> 00:25:32,655
- Sarge.
- What is that?

387
00:25:32,989 --> 00:25:34,198
Look.

388
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:35,824
What?

389
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:37,785
- Oh, no.
- Why not?

390
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:41,747
No, you can't just pull some guy
out of a magazine like he's a decoder ring.

391
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:42,998
You can't do that.

392
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:48,379
Sarge, Max Kennard has shot more crooks than any I.A.
cop in the last hundred years.

393
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:52,633
Sooner or later, there's gonna be gunplay,
and I want Kennard with you when it happens.

394
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:57,888
Max Kennard.

395
00:25:58,723 --> 00:25:59,723
Mind if I join you?

396
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:01,934
All right.

397
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:06,272
Navidad Ramirez.

398
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:09,024
"Christmas" Ramirez?

399
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:11,694
It's all right if you're
a burlesque dancer...

400
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:14,780
but I keep on telling him
it's no kind of name for a lawman.

401
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:16,657
Mind if I talk with you for a minute?

402
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:20,744
Go on, Navidad. Get some air.

403
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:28,127
That kid's not gonna last long
riding with you.

404
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:31,130
Hell, nobody'll work with him
on account of his heritage.

405
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:34,633
I'm going after Mickey Cohen.

406
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:38,262
And I need a gun hand.

407
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:44,643
Wouldn't you know it?

408
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,646
I just happen to have one.

409
00:26:48,231 --> 00:26:51,650
- There it is. Good as new.
- Thanks, Dad.

410
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:53,402
Yeah, don't crash.

411
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,363
Conwell Keeler?

412
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:58,824
Can I help you with something, fella?

413
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:03,454
You need someone with brains
to balance the brawn.

414
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:05,539
He was Army Intelligence.

415
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:08,500
Got demoted for not understanding
the need for a warrant.

416
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:12,171
Rocketdyne's test firing their new
missile up in Santa Susana.

417
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:14,423
It's supposed to be faster than the V-2.

418
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:16,258
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Thank you, baby.

419
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:19,345
You don't know what the V-2 is,
that's okay. This one's faster.

420
00:27:20,513 --> 00:27:22,973
I heard you were the best wire man
in the department.

421
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:24,475
Oh, yeah? Thank you.

422
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:28,395
Look, these other guys I've been asking,
none of them have families.

423
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:30,981
So you wanna think this over?

424
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:32,983
Dad! It's the rocket!

425
00:27:33,234 --> 00:27:35,027
Come on, hurry!

426
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:38,864
Isn't she a beaut?

427
00:27:40,575 --> 00:27:41,617
Look, Dad.

428
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:44,328
Yeah. It's pretty great, right?

429
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:47,623
You know, this...

430
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:49,625
a brighter future...

431
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:51,710
this is what we fought for, isn't it?

432
00:27:53,254 --> 00:27:54,505
Damn right.

433
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:56,423
He grows up...

434
00:27:56,758 --> 00:28:01,887
I don't wanna tell him that I just stood
by while Mickey Cohen took it from us.

435
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:09,561
Mr. Cohen, right this way.

436
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:12,022
Mr. Cohen, how's the haberdashery
business these days?

437
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:13,190
Booming.

438
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:16,568
Mr. Cohen.
What do you think about Chief Parker?

439
00:28:16,736 --> 00:28:18,278
Who?

440
00:28:18,446 --> 00:28:22,199
So nobody's heard from Tommy Russo in
a while. Any idea what's happened to him?

441
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:24,785
Tommy went to live on a big farm...

442
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:29,039
where he's got lots of room to run and
play with all the other Chicago gangsters.

443
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:32,251
You want, I'll take you out there
to visit him sometime.

444
00:28:45,014 --> 00:28:46,640
- Hi, Jack.
- Mickey.

445
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:48,142
You know Red.

446
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:51,645
I think I'll go bend my elbow
while you boys bend your ears.

447
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:57,109
Pair of Jacks. It's not a
two-of-a-kind night, kid. Scram.

448
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:00,320
I'll be at the bar.

449
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:06,118
Scotch.

450
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:12,666
- Grace.
- Jack.

451
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:14,209
Say, kid...

452
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:17,838
why don't you cut Jerry loose
before he gets hurt.

453
00:29:18,381 --> 00:29:20,924
Jerry's a big boy, Jack.

454
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:22,593
- Trust me.
- Yeah.

455
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:26,472
He'll make a big stain on the sidewalk
if Cohen finds out about you two.

456
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:29,725
He's my friend, Grace.
I've known him all my life.

457
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:33,228
He's a sheep in wolf's clothing.

458
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:36,648
He's got a smart mouth...

459
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:38,734
but he's dumb where it counts.

460
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:45,699
What you did to Russo,
that was a disgrace, Mickey.

461
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:50,662
The man rode on a train out from Chicago
to sit with you in good faith.

462
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:52,581
I don't get you.

463
00:29:53,249 --> 00:29:56,376
You have the world by the ass out here.

464
00:29:56,544 --> 00:30:00,756
You got all the prestige, the purse,
the pussy any man could ask for...

465
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:03,801
and you go and you poke Chicago
in the eye.

466
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:05,761
Why?

467
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:07,846
More.

468
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,390
I want more, Jack.

469
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:13,685
You wanna weep over Tommy Russo, fine,
we can drink to Tommy.

470
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:15,854
He was a guy who died
building a railroad...

471
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:19,900
and I'm sorry he won't be out here
when I drive in the golden spike.

472
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:24,112
But what happened to Tommy is nothing.

473
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:26,532
That wasn't murder.

474
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:28,700
It was progress.

475
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:32,246
I am progress.

476
00:30:33,581 --> 00:30:35,165
You know what kills me...

477
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:37,626
is you think you're something new.

478
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:40,462
I've seen guys like you before.

479
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:42,923
The Mojave is filled with them.

480
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:47,845
Bright boys that wanna shoot their way
to the top of the class.

481
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:50,430
You think I lack vision.

482
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:52,015
It's the other way around.

483
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:55,894
Matter of fact, I'm having
a vision right now.

484
00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:01,775
You are gonna wake up one morning with
your best part stuffed into your mouth.

485
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:04,653
I'm sorry, did you say something?

486
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:08,866
I was kidding.

487
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:11,201
I heard you, Jack, you're a funny guy.

488
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:14,121
And I'm not gonna carry water
for you anymore.

489
00:31:14,497 --> 00:31:15,998
You dumb kike.

490
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:20,127
You're old, you're slow. I've outgrown you.

491
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:22,754
I might be getting old,
I might be getting slow...

492
00:31:22,922 --> 00:31:25,173
but I got friends in Chicago
that are neither.

493
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:27,175
This isn't Chicago.

494
00:31:27,343 --> 00:31:30,012
This is the Wild fucking West.

495
00:31:30,513 --> 00:31:32,347
And I've been reading about it.

496
00:31:32,515 --> 00:31:36,143
You heard of Manifest Destiny? That's when
you take what you can when you can.

497
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:39,271
The greasers took it from the redskins
and we took it from them.

498
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:42,649
And I'm gonna take it all from you, Jack,
and not just because I can.

499
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:45,444
But because this is my destiny.

500
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:49,656
Los Angeles is my fucking destiny,
you motherfucker.

501
00:31:56,581 --> 00:32:00,375
When we succeed,
nobody will ever know what we've done.

502
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:03,670
No medals, no promotion.

503
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:08,884
But I'm here to tell you, there's death
in it waiting for the man who hesitates.

504
00:32:09,385 --> 00:32:13,388
Right now, our only advantage is that
he won't know who we are.

505
00:32:13,556 --> 00:32:16,475
So I have only one rule in this outfit.

506
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:19,686
Leave these at home.

507
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:22,147
We're not solving a case here.

508
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:24,191
We're going to war.

509
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:25,692
That sounds good to me.

510
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:28,403
Take it easy. No, I'm on your side.

511
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:30,739
Who the fuck is this guy?

512
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:34,117
He's a huge pain in my ass
is what he is.

513
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:36,244
He followed you here?

514
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:38,789
Real nice, Hopalong.

515
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:40,540
Yeah, but he's heard everything.

516
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:42,542
Yeah, I know your plan.

517
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,002
That's what I just said.

518
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:45,963
I want in.

519
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:47,881
Do you think you're good enough?

520
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:49,841
I got the drop on you, didn't I?

521
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:53,220
Push comes to shove...

522
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:55,389
kid'll stay behind his gun.

523
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:02,437
It's your mess, cowboy.

524
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:05,440
When do we start?

525
00:33:05,608 --> 00:33:09,111
Tonight. We're gonna hit his casino
across the river in Burbank.

526
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:15,617
There's a guy in our cowboy band

527
00:33:15,785 --> 00:33:18,245
He plays the best bass in the land

528
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:21,039
He plays it on and off the beat

529
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:22,791
He plays it hot and he plays it sweet

530
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:25,711
We destroy the equipment,
burn the money.

531
00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:29,715
We're in and out in 10 minutes and across
the river before they know what hit them.

532
00:33:29,882 --> 00:33:32,926
- We gonna do it or talk about it?
- Let's go.

533
00:33:33,636 --> 00:33:35,429
Hey, who are these guys, sarge?

534
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:37,431
Squaw need a new pair of moccasins.

535
00:33:37,598 --> 00:33:40,100
Young brave need firewater!

536
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:41,893
Movie extras.

537
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:46,898
- Yay!
- Get down! Everybody down!

538
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:52,529
Get down! Do what we tell you
and no one gets hurt!

539
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:54,531
- Get down!
- We're here for the money!

540
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:57,200
- Kiss the ground!
- Oh, shit! They're cops!

541
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:58,744
- What?
- Yeah, who are they?

542
00:33:58,911 --> 00:34:00,746
- Those aren't costumes!
- Put them down!

543
00:34:00,913 --> 00:34:02,956
These sons of bitches
are guarding the place!

544
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:05,208
- I said put them down!
- Hey, fuck you!

545
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:06,376
Let's go!

546
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:08,670
Get out! Get out! Abort! Abort!

547
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:10,338
Dirty Burbank sons of bitches!

548
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:11,923
Let's go!

549
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,177
That was a stupid idea!

550
00:34:15,344 --> 00:34:16,344
Shit!

551
00:34:16,512 --> 00:34:17,971
Stay on them!

552
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:19,598
Hold it right there!

553
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:34,029
- It's not starting! You gotta push it!
- Take your foot off the brake!

554
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,160
Hurry, get in!

555
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:41,995
Go, go, go! Just go!

556
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:45,207
Hands in the air! Now!

557
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:48,919
Damn.

558
00:34:50,713 --> 00:34:52,631
The shine had this on him.

559
00:34:53,674 --> 00:34:56,384
You packing a pig-sticker, Bwana?

560
00:34:58,554 --> 00:35:01,139
You must be out here from Chicago...

561
00:35:01,974 --> 00:35:04,392
or maybe from goddamn Mars.

562
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:07,270
Because everybody down here
on planet Earth...

563
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:10,857
knows that Mr. Cohen's place
is sacred ground.

564
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:13,652
Dragna put you up to this?

565
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:15,153
Go to hell.

566
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:23,411
You better believe I'm asking you
a whole lot nicer than Cohen's gonna.

567
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:25,247
Lock them up.

568
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,761
Hey, Jerry. How about a shine?

569
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:42,013
Oh, look, it's Pete. No, it's Re-Pete.

570
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:45,934
Look at those shoes. It looks like they've
seen more steps than the Eiffel Tower.

571
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:50,063
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. I'll make
them shine like the moon, Jerry. The moon.

572
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:51,231
Oh, yeah?

573
00:35:51,899 --> 00:35:53,775
- Okay, Pete.
- All right, all right.

574
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:03,118
New York. It's like being a rat in a maze.

575
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:05,537
Everybody living on top of each other.

576
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:08,832
You wouldn't believe how goddamn
filthy the place is.

577
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:12,294
Whole goddamn place.

578
00:36:12,461 --> 00:36:13,461
How's your mom?

579
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:15,797
How the hell should I know?

580
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:17,757
You should know how your mom is.

581
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:19,426
Okay.

582
00:36:24,056 --> 00:36:27,142
Listen, I heard Cohen's making a move
on Dragna.

583
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:30,187
Is that right?

584
00:36:30,646 --> 00:36:32,355
But out here...

585
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,402
a guy's got room to be something
more than he was.

586
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:39,696
What do you know about
Cohen and Dragna?

587
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:43,116
I'm just saying to keep
your head down, that's all.

588
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:47,245
Keep my head down?
You keep your head down.

589
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:48,496
You're a kid.

590
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:52,959
Only thing you should be worried about is how
you're gonna get your hands up a girl's skirt.

591
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:56,296
That's what you should be worried about.

592
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:00,050
The air's dry.

593
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:02,093
Clean.

594
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:03,511
You can taste it.

595
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:08,850
And that changes you.

596
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,186
Hey, Pete. Go home.

597
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:13,563
- I'm not even done yet.
- Go home right now.

598
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:16,066
- You hear me?
- Yeah, all right.

599
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:17,317
- Go.
- All right.

600
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:19,444
- Go now.
- Okay.

601
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:30,455
I love Los Angeles. I love it.

602
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:45,887
Jerry!

603
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:34,019
Hey. Hey.

604
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:42,027
You can't shoot me. You're a cop.

605
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:44,237
Not anymore.

606
00:39:24,653 --> 00:39:25,904
Come on.

607
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:27,655
Get it together, Jerry.

608
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:30,283
What's the matter with you? Stop it.

609
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:32,994
Whose blood is that, Jerry?

610
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:36,289
You know that shoeshine kid?

611
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:38,416
- They killed him.
- I'm sorry about that.

612
00:39:38,584 --> 00:39:40,418
You gotta screw your head on.

613
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:43,171
Somebody just hit Cohen's place
in Burbank.

614
00:39:44,006 --> 00:39:47,592
They think it was Dragna's guys,
but I can tell you for a fact it wasn't.

615
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:51,096
Couple of strong-armed boys made like
to knock over Mickey's casino.

616
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:52,972
Burbank cops nabbed two of them.

617
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:55,767
Cohen's sending some guys over there now.

618
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:03,024
Goddamn it, O'Mara,
you stupid son of a bitch.

619
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:08,738
I always knew I'd die in Burbank.

620
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,116
They won't kill us here.

621
00:40:11,992 --> 00:40:15,745
Cohen will send somebody to pick us up,
and then you'll wish they had.

622
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:22,919
- Watch the corridor, will you?
- All right.

623
00:40:28,467 --> 00:40:31,511
Hey, fellas. How's the food in there?

624
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:33,012
Sarge.

625
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:40,186
What the hell are you doing, Hopalong?

626
00:40:40,354 --> 00:40:42,480
This here is fixing to be a jailbreak.

627
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:46,943
Supposed to be police officers.
It's like a three-ring circus.

628
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:04,627
- Help you with something, pal?
- Yeah.

629
00:41:05,087 --> 00:41:10,049
Why don't you get off your fat ass
and get me my prisoners?

630
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:13,845
This is the dumbest thing I've ever seen.

631
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:17,807
You're the one that got pinched
and I'm the dummy?

632
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:20,685
You got here awful quick.

633
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:23,062
Yeah, well, Mr. Cohen was in a hurry.

634
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:29,402
Just one guy?

635
00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:31,654
Yeah, don't worry about it.

636
00:41:32,072 --> 00:41:33,573
I can handle these two.

637
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:36,784
With enough left over for you too, pal,
so just open it up.

638
00:41:39,788 --> 00:41:41,206
Help you fellas?

639
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:43,875
Yeah, we're here to pick up some garbage.

640
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:45,168
Two bags.

641
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,504
Oh, shit.

642
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:51,466
Hold it! That guy's bullshit!

643
00:41:55,429 --> 00:41:56,679
Lights out.

644
00:41:57,723 --> 00:41:59,098
Floor it, Navidad!

645
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:05,772
That didn't work.

646
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:19,661
Who's there?

647
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:23,039
Bwana's a Swahili word.

648
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:26,459
Means "sir." Got it?

649
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:28,044
Yes, sir.

650
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,923
Come on, let's go, let's go.

651
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:40,139
Now, who the fuck is this guy?

652
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:42,058
Jerry Wooters.

653
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:43,768
He's one of us.

654
00:42:48,023 --> 00:42:50,775
I know it doesn't look like much now.

655
00:42:51,777 --> 00:42:54,487
But this is gonna be my crown jewel.

656
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:56,614
Welcome to El Dorado Trust.

657
00:42:57,116 --> 00:43:01,327
We're standing in the middle
of a money-making machine.

658
00:43:01,495 --> 00:43:02,662
Makes me giddy.

659
00:43:03,038 --> 00:43:05,248
We got all the whores and dope sewn up.

660
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:07,834
But pari-mutuel wagering, bang.

661
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:10,128
Off-track betting, ba-bang.

662
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:12,213
That's where the real money is.

663
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:14,549
Have this place open in a few weeks.

664
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:18,845
After that, all the wire traffic west
of Chicago comes right through here.

665
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:20,054
Millions.

666
00:43:20,222 --> 00:43:23,099
I couldn't make it any faster if I was
printing it myself.

667
00:43:23,392 --> 00:43:24,892
What about the Syndicate?

668
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:27,854
That's the past. This is the future.

669
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:31,399
I'll buy them off with money we pull
out of this place alone.

670
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:33,860
Buy every politician from here to Frisco.

671
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:37,697
Within a month, we'll have the whole
West Coast tied up in a nice ribbon.

672
00:43:54,673 --> 00:43:55,757
Come on.

673
00:44:26,038 --> 00:44:27,830
All right? Your turn.

674
00:44:35,589 --> 00:44:37,298
You gonna break leather, Hopalong?

675
00:44:37,466 --> 00:44:39,300
Or you just gonna watch us?

676
00:44:53,273 --> 00:44:54,565
You were saying?

677
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:56,818
Get on up here, Navidad.

678
00:44:58,028 --> 00:44:59,445
Sheesh.

679
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:01,614
You loaded?

680
00:45:09,915 --> 00:45:12,166
Don't shoot where it is, son.

681
00:45:12,751 --> 00:45:14,627
Shoot where it's gonna be.

682
00:45:30,936 --> 00:45:32,395
They got Dragna.

683
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:34,814
They killed everybody in the house.

684
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:38,234
His wife. Killed the maid, for chrissake.

685
00:45:38,777 --> 00:45:42,071
Cohen must have thought what we did
to his casino was Dragna's guys.

686
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:43,740
This was payback.

687
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:45,700
It's war. People die.

688
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:50,037
I'm sorry, I can't believe you would
say something like that.

689
00:45:50,497 --> 00:45:52,832
Sarge, I don't want any more
civilian casualties.

690
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,167
Then talk to Cohen.

691
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:56,043
I'd rather listen to him.

692
00:45:56,211 --> 00:45:59,380
All we do is plant a bug and we can
hear everything he says.

693
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:03,009
One of the clubs?

694
00:46:03,385 --> 00:46:04,677
No, his house.

695
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:17,648
It takes him three minutes
to get around the house. Go.

696
00:46:43,842 --> 00:46:46,385
Hey, guys, do you want in on this?

697
00:46:46,553 --> 00:46:49,555
- You owe me 10 bucks from last night.
- You always say that.

698
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:51,516
We're here to play cards.

699
00:46:51,683 --> 00:46:54,060
- So five-card draw?
- Sounds good.

700
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:11,202
- What are you doing?
- Just looking at a picture.

701
00:47:18,126 --> 00:47:21,212
Cohen's home. Get out now. Get out.

702
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:32,557
Dessert, Mr. Cohen?

703
00:47:32,724 --> 00:47:34,851
Oh, hot fudge sundae.

704
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:39,105
Let's taste that, yeah.

705
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:40,773
You're the best.

706
00:47:41,066 --> 00:47:43,526
- I'm just gonna powder my nose.
- Whatever.

707
00:48:08,093 --> 00:48:10,219
Hey, Mickey. Anybody home?

708
00:48:12,472 --> 00:48:14,515
Karl, I wanna take a look at that property.

709
00:48:14,683 --> 00:48:17,852
- That bakery down near Boyle Heights.
- You got it, Mickey.

710
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:20,688
- Hi.
- You heard anything?

711
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:23,232
Apparently, Johnny Stomp's
balling Lana Turner.

712
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,526
Sinatra sounds pretty sore about it.

713
00:48:25,694 --> 00:48:30,406
Judge Carter is a world-class whoremonger
and Mickey takes good care of him.

714
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:31,574
Figures.

715
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:34,368
Those are the locations of some of the
books around town.

716
00:48:34,536 --> 00:48:37,663
There must be a ton of them.
He's building something.

717
00:48:37,873 --> 00:48:39,749
I don't know what it is yet.

718
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:41,834
Okay, well, we gotta find it.

719
00:48:42,127 --> 00:48:44,045
No. Don't touch that.

720
00:48:44,212 --> 00:48:45,504
Get some grub.

721
00:48:47,799 --> 00:48:49,884
You got something to tell me, Romeo?

722
00:48:52,137 --> 00:48:53,471
It's nothing.

723
00:48:55,098 --> 00:48:56,390
It didn't look like nothing.

724
00:48:56,558 --> 00:48:57,725
What the hell is this?

725
00:48:57,893 --> 00:49:00,895
Hey, guys, guys. I just heard
something about a heroin shipment.

726
00:49:01,063 --> 00:49:03,522
- Let me hear. Let me hear.
- Here.

727
00:49:05,567 --> 00:49:08,653
- I can't hear it, Con. Turn it up.
- Well, it's up all the way.

728
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:11,489
- I can't hear anything.
- I think they're leaving the room.

729
00:49:11,657 --> 00:49:14,075
- Oh, come on.
- Yeah, they left the room.

730
00:49:14,242 --> 00:49:15,368
Shit.

731
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:20,915
- Where. We need to know where.
- I don't know. I'll keep listening.

732
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:22,750
- I know a guy who can tell us.
- Who?

733
00:49:23,543 --> 00:49:25,294
Old friend from the neighborhood.

734
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:29,423
Cohen's got some medicine coming.
Where's he bringing it in?

735
00:49:29,591 --> 00:49:31,634
I don't know!

736
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:33,594
- Don't lie to me, boy.
- Wait, wait!

737
00:49:33,762 --> 00:49:35,054
Harris, they'll kill me.

738
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:38,474
Not if you leave town, they won't.
Now, start talking.

739
00:49:40,268 --> 00:49:42,478
Burbank Airport, Friday night.

740
00:49:42,646 --> 00:49:44,063
- You sure?
- Yes!

741
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:47,483
All right. Get your ass out of here. Damn.

742
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:50,903
I can't believe we going back to Burbank.

743
00:49:55,909 --> 00:49:57,952
That stuff is Mickey's poison.

744
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:00,371
We shut it down, we take away
his best weapon.

745
00:50:03,458 --> 00:50:04,792
Let me get that for you, sir.

746
00:50:11,174 --> 00:50:12,550
We good?

747
00:50:15,637 --> 00:50:17,096
All right, let's go.

748
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:19,724
Come on.

749
00:50:26,064 --> 00:50:28,607
Let's just wait until they get over
the river into I.A.

750
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:31,694
I think we've worn out our welcome
with the Burbank P.D.

751
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:39,493
Forget it, let's take them now.

752
00:50:43,498 --> 00:50:45,833
Looks like we picked up
a couple of ticks.

753
00:50:46,418 --> 00:50:47,960
Let's burn them off the road.

754
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:53,299
Shit!

755
00:50:54,384 --> 00:50:55,801
Oh, my God!

756
00:50:55,969 --> 00:50:57,219
Everybody get down!

757
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:00,848
Hold on to your hats, boys!

758
00:51:01,975 --> 00:51:03,434
Jesus Christ!

759
00:51:11,276 --> 00:51:12,610
Take them out!

760
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:26,207
You're giving them a clear shot!

761
00:51:26,541 --> 00:51:29,376
- All right, that's it!
- Where the hell is he going?

762
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:31,212
Get out of the way!

763
00:51:31,379 --> 00:51:32,630
What the hell's he doing?

764
00:51:32,881 --> 00:51:34,173
Move over!

765
00:51:43,391 --> 00:51:44,683
Where the hell did he go?

766
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:46,477
- You see him?
- No, sir!

767
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:47,895
Damn it, you see him?

768
00:51:50,065 --> 00:51:51,190
Jesus!

769
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:53,484
Oh, shit!

770
00:52:09,543 --> 00:52:10,709
What the hell is that?

771
00:52:11,837 --> 00:52:13,003
Shit!

772
00:52:14,256 --> 00:52:15,714
Jesus Christ!

773
00:52:16,216 --> 00:52:18,175
John, back off! Back off!

774
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:21,637
Grenade! Shit!

775
00:52:23,765 --> 00:52:24,807
Grab it!

776
00:52:33,942 --> 00:52:34,984
Hit him harder!

777
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:39,405
All right, hang on.

778
00:52:40,699 --> 00:52:42,700
Son of a bitch. No!

779
00:52:48,456 --> 00:52:49,748
Okay.

780
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:52,376
Closer, Navidad!

781
00:52:52,794 --> 00:52:54,170
Shit.

782
00:53:11,813 --> 00:53:13,397
Let's go, hoss.

783
00:53:14,691 --> 00:53:16,567
- Where do you want them?
- Right here.

784
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:20,487
Who the hell are you?

785
00:53:20,655 --> 00:53:24,158
You don't know what you done, pal.
You think he's gonna laugh this off?

786
00:53:24,326 --> 00:53:25,743
He will hunt you down.

787
00:53:25,911 --> 00:53:29,788
That's not your problem anymore.
You hear me?

788
00:53:29,956 --> 00:53:32,791
You have their wallets?
What are their names?

789
00:53:32,959 --> 00:53:35,127
Edgar Beaumont and Jeffrey Clark.

790
00:53:35,295 --> 00:53:36,503
We know who you are.

791
00:53:36,671 --> 00:53:39,632
You used to run dope for Mickey Cohen.
You're retired.

792
00:53:52,354 --> 00:53:53,896
Let's get out of here.

793
00:54:06,117 --> 00:54:09,328
You really wanna win this thing,
or you wanna die trying?

794
00:54:09,496 --> 00:54:14,208
Don't get me wrong, I love shooting gangsters
in the legs just as much as the next guy.

795
00:54:14,376 --> 00:54:16,460
But we're gonna have to be smarter
next time.

796
00:54:17,003 --> 00:54:20,881
Playing hot potato with a grenade
isn't much of a strategy.

797
00:54:23,176 --> 00:54:25,052
We got really lucky.

798
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:29,598
If we keep going head-on at him like this,
we're not gonna make it more than a week.

799
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:31,767
It worked, Jerry.

800
00:54:32,310 --> 00:54:33,727
Get in the car.

801
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:46,865
Mr. Cohen, sir. I... The

802
00:54:47,033 --> 00:54:50,202
Someone hit the shipment.

803
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:51,829
I'm sorry.

804
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:56,375
Who hit the shipment?

805
00:54:56,835 --> 00:54:59,586
Guineas from back East.
Maybe Russo's people.

806
00:54:59,754 --> 00:55:02,047
I don't know.

807
00:55:02,841 --> 00:55:05,009
Maybe Russo's people.

808
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:08,387
Well...

809
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:12,558
These things happen.

810
00:55:15,312 --> 00:55:16,979
Thank you, Mr. Cohen.

811
00:55:18,898 --> 00:55:19,940
Karl.

812
00:55:20,692 --> 00:55:22,359
You know the drill.

813
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:25,571
No! No! Karl, no!

814
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:27,197
Hey, Karl! No!

815
00:55:27,907 --> 00:55:29,908
- I'm begging you!
- You stupid bastard.

816
00:55:30,744 --> 00:55:34,246
This ain't right! This ain't right!

817
00:55:38,918 --> 00:55:42,546
Fallin' for no one but you

818
00:55:43,757 --> 00:55:46,175
There's no use denying

819
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:47,968
I might as well confess

820
00:55:48,136 --> 00:55:49,678
- Come in.
- Mrs. O'Mara?

821
00:55:50,305 --> 00:55:51,722
Please, Connie.

822
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:54,308
Jerry Wooters. Nice to meet you.

823
00:55:54,476 --> 00:55:56,852
Nice to meet you too. What'd you bring?

824
00:55:57,479 --> 00:55:58,729
Bear claws.

825
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:05,361
Congratulations. I didn't...

826
00:56:05,528 --> 00:56:07,946
Thank you. John didn't tell you?

827
00:56:08,615 --> 00:56:09,782
No, he didn't.

828
00:56:09,949 --> 00:56:11,950
- Where is that guy?
- Out back.

829
00:56:12,118 --> 00:56:13,410
Okay.

830
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:18,165
This little bird told me when we marry

831
00:56:18,333 --> 00:56:19,792
Jerry?

832
00:56:19,959 --> 00:56:20,959
Yeah?

833
00:56:21,127 --> 00:56:26,256
I know. What kind of a guy would take on a
job like this with his wife in my condition?

834
00:56:26,591 --> 00:56:27,758
That kind of guy.

835
00:56:28,885 --> 00:56:33,347
My husband's the bravest man I know
but he is not much for abstract thinking.

836
00:56:33,515 --> 00:56:35,891
Honor and duty are as real as I am.

837
00:56:36,476 --> 00:56:39,478
So if it comes down to a choice
between his life and his duty...

838
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:41,939
You want me to push him
in the right direction?

839
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:44,233
Can I shove him in the right direction?

840
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:46,527
That's why I picked you. You seem sensible.

841
00:56:46,694 --> 00:56:48,278
Well, that's a nice way to put it.

842
00:56:48,446 --> 00:56:50,823
I handpicked all of you guys,
except the Mexican kid.

843
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:54,785
- I don't know where you found him.
- I don't know where he came from either.

844
00:56:56,704 --> 00:56:58,038
Take that out?

845
00:56:58,289 --> 00:56:59,998
John's a lucky guy, Connie.

846
00:57:04,129 --> 00:57:05,170
Look, you know what?

847
00:57:05,338 --> 00:57:07,172
You should get your wife a Cadillac.

848
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:09,383
How's your love life these days?

849
00:57:09,551 --> 00:57:11,009
Your wife deserves a Cadillac.

850
00:57:11,177 --> 00:57:15,097
You're driving a Studebaker, you should
buy yourself a Cadillac. It's a nice car.

851
00:57:15,265 --> 00:57:17,099
You don't get cars like that too often.

852
00:57:17,517 --> 00:57:20,894
You know, Jerry, one of these nights
she's just gonna get bored.

853
00:57:21,229 --> 00:57:22,521
Scared.

854
00:57:23,356 --> 00:57:27,192
Or he'll give her a rock and she'll
just roll on us in a fit of gratitude.

855
00:57:28,236 --> 00:57:31,447
Or he'll just find out she's got
a new swain and that's not good.

856
00:57:34,742 --> 00:57:39,621
With all due respect, sarge, you don't
know a goddamn thing about her.

857
00:57:40,248 --> 00:57:41,373
Gentlemen.

858
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:46,503
I would congratulate you
on a job well done.

859
00:57:47,797 --> 00:57:50,132
But then I was never here.

860
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:53,760
Cohen has already organized a dragnet.

861
00:57:53,928 --> 00:57:56,054
He has his people inside the department...

862
00:57:56,222 --> 00:57:59,141
hunting for the gang
that hit his drug shipment.

863
00:57:59,517 --> 00:58:03,020
It's only a matter of time until
he realizes you're cops.

864
00:58:03,771 --> 00:58:07,191
We need to step up our timetable here,
sergeant.

865
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:10,068
We need to offer Cohen no quarter.

866
00:58:10,236 --> 00:58:11,862
I'm not a quarter kind of guy, sir.

867
00:58:12,322 --> 00:58:13,363
Neither am I.

868
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:53,028
Get out!

869
00:59:28,523 --> 00:59:29,773
Over there.

870
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:33,986
Telephones, wires. Hey, hey.

871
00:59:34,153 --> 00:59:36,363
You are dead, pal. You are all dea...

872
00:59:39,033 --> 00:59:40,367
Yeah, we get that a lot.

873
01:00:01,723 --> 01:00:03,974
Find these bastards.

874
01:00:05,226 --> 01:00:06,768
Kill them all.

875
01:00:07,604 --> 01:00:09,271
Kill their families.

876
01:00:09,439 --> 01:00:10,564
Their kids.

877
01:00:10,732 --> 01:00:12,608
Their dogs. Their cats.

878
01:00:12,775 --> 01:00:15,152
They're on the scent of El Dorado Trust.

879
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:19,197
We cannot let that happen.
Do you understand me?

880
01:00:20,742 --> 01:00:25,621
El Dorado Trust.

881
01:00:26,331 --> 01:00:27,831
It's an A-bomb.

882
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:30,542
It's Mickey Cohen's pride and joy.

883
01:00:31,336 --> 01:00:33,670
The whole reason he killed
Tommy Russo...

884
01:00:33,838 --> 01:00:36,173
was to take over his
Continental Wire service...

885
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:40,636
which means Cohen's got the only wire
between here and Chicago.

886
01:00:41,387 --> 01:00:45,807
He's building the central book
for the entire western United States.

887
01:00:45,975 --> 01:00:47,851
Wait, what's the central book?

888
01:00:48,019 --> 01:00:51,480
All gambling money on the West Coast
will go through a central book...

889
01:00:51,648 --> 01:00:53,899
and Mickey Cohen
will touch every penny.

890
01:00:54,067 --> 01:00:58,070
If he gets that thing up and running,
inside a week it won't matter what we do.

891
01:00:58,446 --> 01:01:00,781
It'll be growing faster than we can
tear it down.

892
01:01:01,324 --> 01:01:02,991
He'll own the whole goddamn state.

893
01:01:03,368 --> 01:01:04,368
Where is it?

894
01:01:05,536 --> 01:01:06,662
I don't know.

895
01:01:07,288 --> 01:01:09,039
They haven't said a thing.

896
01:01:09,374 --> 01:01:10,874
Well, we gotta find it.

897
01:01:11,042 --> 01:01:12,668
Yes, we do.

898
01:01:14,003 --> 01:01:15,629
We don't have a lot of time, Jerry.

899
01:01:27,475 --> 01:01:28,850
I'm not gonna get her killed.

900
01:01:30,019 --> 01:01:31,311
You gotta ask her.

901
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:32,979
Or I will.

902
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:37,984
You know, I ain't gotta
prove myself to you.

903
01:01:38,152 --> 01:01:40,404
You asked me to be here and I'm here.

904
01:01:41,072 --> 01:01:43,615
I'm risking my life,
like every single guy in there.

905
01:01:43,783 --> 01:01:44,908
But there's a line.

906
01:01:45,576 --> 01:01:46,910
You go and talk to my girl...

907
01:01:47,078 --> 01:01:50,455
you put her in danger, you're gonna
cross that line with me, pal.

908
01:01:50,623 --> 01:01:52,958
I'm not questioning your loyalty, Jerry.

909
01:01:53,543 --> 01:01:54,876
Don't go near her.

910
01:01:55,586 --> 01:01:57,546
Just do what needs to be done.

911
01:02:13,896 --> 01:02:15,397
You're going somewhere?

912
01:02:16,941 --> 01:02:18,233
I gotta go.

913
01:02:25,283 --> 01:02:26,825
You gotta do that in front of me?

914
01:02:28,161 --> 01:02:30,787
You gotta make yourself pretty for him
in front of me?

915
01:02:32,039 --> 01:02:34,916
- What's the matter?
- You got a lot of nerve.

916
01:02:36,794 --> 01:02:38,170
What are we doing?

917
01:02:38,588 --> 01:02:40,547
I can't figure out your angle.

918
01:02:41,799 --> 01:02:42,883
What's your angle?

919
01:02:43,050 --> 01:02:45,093
What were you doing in his house, Jerry?

920
01:02:45,261 --> 01:02:46,928
You don't wanna know that.

921
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:51,391
Why didn't you tell me you're a cop?

922
01:02:52,518 --> 01:02:53,810
I'm looking out for you.

923
01:02:53,978 --> 01:02:57,314
- Trust me.
- No. I don't trust you.

924
01:03:01,068 --> 01:03:03,111
He's gonna plant us both.

925
01:03:07,658 --> 01:03:10,702
- That stirs you a little, doesn't it?
- Oh, yeah, that stirs me up.

926
01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:14,206
- It does, Jerry, admit it.
- It stirs me right up.

927
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:16,958
Maybe that's why you're with him.

928
01:03:17,335 --> 01:03:19,795
- You think that's why I'm with him?
- I don't know.

929
01:03:21,923 --> 01:03:24,466
I came out here to be a star, Jerry.

930
01:03:25,635 --> 01:03:27,677
I figured I couldn't lose.

931
01:03:31,307 --> 01:03:33,725
I figured wrong, didn't I?

932
01:03:38,397 --> 01:03:40,565
I'm open to suggestions.

933
01:03:41,442 --> 01:03:42,776
Don't go.

934
01:03:43,778 --> 01:03:45,111
Don't let me.

935
01:04:02,964 --> 01:04:06,091
One-two..

936
01:04:06,259 --> 01:04:08,093
This the one where you break his jaw?

937
01:04:10,596 --> 01:04:11,972
Hey, Claude Rains.

938
01:04:14,725 --> 01:04:16,810
Come here,
I wanna show you something.

939
01:04:16,978 --> 01:04:18,687
Hurt him. Yeah.

940
01:04:23,734 --> 01:04:27,195
This putz was trying to steal my title.

941
01:04:28,072 --> 01:04:29,698
Story of my life.

942
01:04:30,157 --> 01:04:33,118
Some bum's always trying to steal
what's mine.

943
01:04:34,203 --> 01:04:35,662
You gotta dance.

944
01:04:39,542 --> 01:04:41,209
Come on. Finish him.

945
01:04:46,841 --> 01:04:48,675
- Hey, Dad?
- Yeah?

946
01:04:48,843 --> 01:04:51,344
Mom wants to know when you're gonna
put up the lights.

947
01:04:51,512 --> 01:04:54,514
As soon as I'm done here.
Can you hand me those wire strippers?

948
01:04:54,682 --> 01:04:55,849
Yeah.

949
01:04:56,475 --> 01:04:58,810
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

950
01:04:58,978 --> 01:05:01,938
Son, your dad's a genius.

951
01:05:03,441 --> 01:05:04,816
Go tell your mom that.

952
01:05:06,068 --> 01:05:10,530
So the first one's Pacific Telephone.
The second one's Western Union.

953
01:05:10,698 --> 01:05:11,948
And that third one...

954
01:05:12,116 --> 01:05:14,367
- Cohen's.
- That's right.

955
01:05:14,535 --> 01:05:16,578
That's all there is to it?
Just cut the wire?

956
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:20,040
No. You cut the wire, they'd be out
here in an hour to repair it.

957
01:05:20,207 --> 01:05:22,709
El Dorado Trust is the terminus
of the wire, right?

958
01:05:22,877 --> 01:05:27,213
So all you gotta do is ping the wire and the
pulse echo will tell you how far away it is.

959
01:05:27,548 --> 01:05:28,924
Why didn't I think of that?

960
01:05:29,091 --> 01:05:30,634
Hey, keep an eye out.

961
01:05:41,604 --> 01:05:42,938
What'll it be?

962
01:05:45,149 --> 01:05:46,483
Remember 75.

963
01:05:49,779 --> 01:05:52,405
And bingo.

964
01:05:52,823 --> 01:05:54,407
You gotta be shitting me.

965
01:05:54,909 --> 01:05:57,285
Am I the only one who thinks
this is fucking insane?

966
01:05:57,453 --> 01:05:59,704
Because there's an alarm,
it goes right to Cohen.

967
01:05:59,872 --> 01:06:02,207
It'll take me 10 minutes to find it
and disable it.

968
01:06:02,375 --> 01:06:03,750
You got 5 then.

969
01:06:03,918 --> 01:06:06,920
Shooting starts, sheriffs are gonna be
all over our asses.

970
01:06:07,088 --> 01:06:08,463
You sure we can pull this off?

971
01:06:10,007 --> 01:06:11,049
No.

972
01:06:11,592 --> 01:06:12,884
Let's do it then.

973
01:06:56,929 --> 01:06:58,388
- Hey.
- Hey.

974
01:06:58,556 --> 01:06:59,931
- Hey.
- Howdy.

975
01:07:00,099 --> 01:07:02,100
- Who are you guys?
- We're the band.

976
01:07:04,645 --> 01:07:05,937
Oh, shit.

977
01:07:10,443 --> 01:07:12,485
- Keeler?
- All clear.

978
01:07:36,886 --> 01:07:38,553
Boom, chica, boom-boom-boom-boom-boom

979
01:07:43,893 --> 01:07:46,853
All right, everybody, time to go home!
Out!

980
01:07:47,021 --> 01:07:49,272
Ladies, go on and take
the rest of the night off.

981
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:51,649
Come on, ladies. That means you. Get up.

982
01:07:52,526 --> 01:07:54,152
Let's go, ladies. Come on.

983
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:56,071
We already took care of that.

984
01:08:01,911 --> 01:08:03,453
Ch-ch-chica, boom

985
01:08:16,592 --> 01:08:18,927
Chica, chica, boom, chica boom
Chica, boom-boom-boom

986
01:08:19,095 --> 01:08:20,720
Boom, chica, boom-boom-boom

987
01:08:22,098 --> 01:08:23,973
Everybody out! Now!

988
01:08:24,934 --> 01:08:26,059
Everybody out!

989
01:08:53,087 --> 01:08:54,671
My, oh, my.

990
01:08:55,714 --> 01:08:58,424
What the fuck happened here, Eugene?

991
01:08:58,592 --> 01:09:01,511
We don't know, Mr. Cohen.
Right now, I'm coordinating the...

992
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:04,430
"Coordinating"? What's this coordinating?

993
01:09:04,598 --> 01:09:05,932
Take the dog.

994
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:07,100
No, the deputy.

995
01:09:11,939 --> 01:09:14,023
This how you take care of business?

996
01:09:14,191 --> 01:09:15,942
You motherfucker!

997
01:09:16,110 --> 01:09:20,530
You will find the cocksuckers
that did this to me!

998
01:09:20,698 --> 01:09:22,740
You will find them!

999
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:25,702
Drink. Come on.

1000
01:09:25,870 --> 01:09:27,912
- Look, look. Come on.
- Shut up.

1001
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:30,540
Come on, you son of a... Drink.

1002
01:09:30,708 --> 01:09:31,916
No, it's right here, man.

1003
01:09:32,084 --> 01:09:34,043
Drink it. Don't be scared, don't be scared.

1004
01:09:34,211 --> 01:09:38,506
Our young Señor Ramirez is drunker
than a peach orchard sow.

1005
01:09:38,674 --> 01:09:40,049
- Let me tap you.
- No, I'm good.

1006
01:09:40,217 --> 01:09:41,217
You sure?

1007
01:09:41,385 --> 01:09:42,719
It's not good right now.

1008
01:09:43,387 --> 01:09:44,888
Sarge, come here for a second.

1009
01:09:45,055 --> 01:09:47,891
- Come on, everybody. Get over here.
- Come on, sarge.

1010
01:09:48,058 --> 01:09:49,392
Sarge, come here.

1011
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:50,643
To the sarge.

1012
01:09:50,811 --> 01:09:52,979
For bringing us all home safe.

1013
01:09:53,147 --> 01:09:57,525
You're a bull in a china shop, but we'd
follow you anywhere. To the sarge.

1014
01:09:57,693 --> 01:10:01,029
No, look, this victory
belongs to all of us.

1015
01:10:01,447 --> 01:10:06,201
You know, I've run with a lot of outfits,
but none better than you group of misfits.

1016
01:10:07,578 --> 01:10:08,578
Cheers.

1017
01:10:08,746 --> 01:10:11,414
- To the Gangster Squad.
- The Gangster Squad.

1018
01:10:20,507 --> 01:10:22,342
How much did they get away with?

1019
01:10:22,968 --> 01:10:24,093
Nothing.

1020
01:10:24,595 --> 01:10:26,638
Neddy says they didn't take the money.

1021
01:10:33,395 --> 01:10:34,979
They're cops.

1022
01:10:38,108 --> 01:10:41,110
Chief Parker put them up to it.

1023
01:10:42,529 --> 01:10:47,408
I've had it with that sadistic,
Bible-thumping boozer.

1024
01:10:49,119 --> 01:10:50,536
He's done.

1025
01:10:51,497 --> 01:10:54,040
We never had that kind of trouble before.

1026
01:10:54,875 --> 01:10:56,584
Trust me, Karl.

1027
01:10:57,211 --> 01:11:01,047
I've bought myself enough cops.
I know what I'm talking about.

1028
01:11:02,675 --> 01:11:05,843
These guys are a special brand.

1029
01:11:06,345 --> 01:11:08,638
They're hard cases, not
interested in money.

1030
01:11:08,806 --> 01:11:11,224
A cop that's not for sale
is like a dog with rabies.

1031
01:11:11,392 --> 01:11:13,685
There's no medicine for
it, you just gotta...

1032
01:11:15,104 --> 01:11:16,562
put him down.

1033
01:11:23,862 --> 01:11:25,822
Somebody peached to them.

1034
01:11:28,117 --> 01:11:30,493
Somebody up and turned rat on me!

1035
01:11:32,162 --> 01:11:35,415
There's ears in this fucking house!
Find them!

1036
01:11:36,709 --> 01:11:38,751
The slut cluck bitches!

1037
01:11:39,420 --> 01:11:43,631
Come on. We need to get you out of here
before he runs out of pretty things to break.

1038
01:11:44,091 --> 01:11:47,218
Now, you don't ever need to come
back here, Miss Grace. Not ever.

1039
01:12:04,236 --> 01:12:07,280
Wrevock's gonna
pick up the shipment tonight in Chinatown.

1040
01:12:07,448 --> 01:12:09,073
Use the laundry truck.

1041
01:12:09,325 --> 01:12:10,700
No, wait, you gotta hear this.

1042
01:12:13,245 --> 01:12:17,040
You don't make this deal,
we're finished, you hear me? Done.

1043
01:12:17,207 --> 01:12:19,500
That hit on Slapsy's is still killing us.

1044
01:12:19,668 --> 01:12:22,587
Wrevock's gonna pick up the shipment
tonight in Chinatown.

1045
01:12:22,755 --> 01:12:26,049
Use the laundry truck. Don't fuck it up.
I need this.

1046
01:12:26,425 --> 01:12:27,425
We hurt him.

1047
01:12:28,302 --> 01:12:31,804
He is bleeding cash. Desperate enough
to do this out in the open.

1048
01:12:31,972 --> 01:12:34,807
We intercept that dope,
he is dead in the water.

1049
01:12:36,185 --> 01:12:39,812
You know, I signed up for this...

1050
01:12:41,857 --> 01:12:46,402
so that I could tell my boy that I
at least tried to do something about it.

1051
01:12:46,570 --> 01:12:49,655
But I hope he never finds out about
all the things we've done.

1052
01:12:49,823 --> 01:12:51,532
Con, we did what we had to do.

1053
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:55,620
Can you remind me of the difference
between us and them?

1054
01:12:57,664 --> 01:12:59,999
Because at this point,
I can't tell anymore.

1055
01:13:00,542 --> 01:13:03,252
You want to find a witness to sign
their own death warrant?

1056
01:13:03,420 --> 01:13:08,466
Con, look, this is the only way
we can beat him. The only way.

1057
01:13:11,512 --> 01:13:12,720
Okay.

1058
01:13:17,101 --> 01:13:20,686
All right, look,
I need you on the wire tonight.

1059
01:13:20,854 --> 01:13:22,021
- Okay?
- Oh, no.

1060
01:13:22,189 --> 01:13:26,109
In case Cohen has a change of plan.
It's all right, Con.

1061
01:13:26,276 --> 01:13:28,903
You sit this one out. We can handle it.

1062
01:13:29,655 --> 01:13:30,780
All right?

1063
01:13:32,282 --> 01:13:33,366
Okay.

1064
01:13:45,921 --> 01:13:46,963
Hey.

1065
01:13:48,215 --> 01:13:49,549
You wanted to talk to me?

1066
01:13:50,342 --> 01:13:51,801
He thinks somebody ratted.

1067
01:13:52,177 --> 01:13:53,219
He what?

1068
01:13:53,387 --> 01:13:56,597
- It's a matter of time before he gets to me.
- What are you doing here?

1069
01:13:56,765 --> 01:14:01,811
- I gotta get out of town. You should too.
- I can't. Gracie, look, for whatever it's worth...

1070
01:14:05,983 --> 01:14:09,861
Look, for whatever it's worth, Cohen had
nothing to do with us. Not for one second.

1071
01:14:10,028 --> 01:14:11,237
Don't run. Just stay.

1072
01:14:14,074 --> 01:14:15,366
Can I help you fellas?

1073
01:14:15,534 --> 01:14:18,578
- We'll get to you in a minute.
- We wanna talk to her, is all.

1074
01:14:18,745 --> 01:14:21,289
Hey, we got a message from Mr. Cohen.

1075
01:14:21,457 --> 01:14:24,083
It just seems like the lady
doesn't want to talk to you.

1076
01:14:24,251 --> 01:14:27,753
What lady? She's just one of Mickey's
pro skirts, there, pal.

1077
01:14:35,220 --> 01:14:36,220
Where is it?

1078
01:14:36,388 --> 01:14:38,264
- Where is it?
- It's over there!

1079
01:14:39,183 --> 01:14:42,310
- No, no, no.
- What is that?

1080
01:14:42,478 --> 01:14:44,729
Is that your message for her?
Is that acid?

1081
01:14:44,938 --> 01:14:48,191
- Oh, come on.
- I ever see you near her again, I'll kill you.

1082
01:14:48,358 --> 01:14:50,193
- Okay.
- Good.

1083
01:14:53,697 --> 01:14:55,323
Damn it!

1084
01:14:55,657 --> 01:14:57,158
Fuck!

1085
01:14:57,659 --> 01:15:00,077
You're gonna get yours!

1086
01:15:01,705 --> 01:15:04,874
We know Cohen's sending
Wrevock here to meet the shipment.

1087
01:15:05,042 --> 01:15:08,377
Maintain surveillance until he reaches
the target location.

1088
01:15:08,545 --> 01:15:10,505
He's gonna lead us right to the dope.

1089
01:15:10,672 --> 01:15:15,635
We get this shipment, it's over.
No more business.

1090
01:15:15,802 --> 01:15:18,387
A lot of civilians, this goes south.

1091
01:15:18,555 --> 01:15:22,475
Let's make sure that doesn't happen.
Come on.

1092
01:15:24,019 --> 01:15:27,230
- Where's Wooters?
- Wasn't my turn to watch him.

1093
01:15:29,107 --> 01:15:30,775
We're ready to go now for round 9...

1094
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:33,184
of the scheduled 15-round
lightweight championship...

1095
01:15:34,613 --> 01:15:36,739
in the Olympic Auditorium,
Los Angeles, California.

1096
01:15:44,915 --> 01:15:46,958
Jerry. Grace.

1097
01:15:47,125 --> 01:15:48,292
Come on in.

1098
01:15:48,460 --> 01:15:50,002
Come on, quick.

1099
01:15:58,220 --> 01:15:59,804
I gotta ask you a favor.

1100
01:16:00,180 --> 01:16:02,223
I need you to get Gracie
out of town tonight.

1101
01:16:02,641 --> 01:16:03,808
Yeah.

1102
01:16:05,143 --> 01:16:06,269
I can do that.

1103
01:16:07,312 --> 01:16:08,396
Thank you.

1104
01:16:09,648 --> 01:16:10,648
I gotta go.

1105
01:16:26,915 --> 01:16:28,541
Are you guys sisters?

1106
01:16:28,709 --> 01:16:30,167
We can be.

1107
01:16:32,212 --> 01:16:34,505
- Wait here in case he doubles back.
- Got it.

1108
01:18:02,219 --> 01:18:04,720
- Jesus Christ, Wooters.
- Where the fuck were you?

1109
01:18:04,888 --> 01:18:06,138
Where's John?

1110
01:18:23,365 --> 01:18:24,365
John!

1111
01:18:25,367 --> 01:18:27,159
John! John!

1112
01:18:39,923 --> 01:18:41,173
John, look out!

1113
01:19:37,898 --> 01:19:39,607
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

1114
01:19:56,750 --> 01:19:58,125
Fuck!

1115
01:20:02,297 --> 01:20:03,756
Oh, Jesus.

1116
01:20:04,090 --> 01:20:05,090
Keeler.

1117
01:20:05,759 --> 01:20:10,179
I was 9 years old when I robbed the
Palace Theater with a baseball bat.

1118
01:20:11,139 --> 01:20:13,098
Cashier was laughing.

1119
01:20:14,226 --> 01:20:16,143
Till I bashed his head in.

1120
01:20:17,395 --> 01:20:19,730
Knocking the place over,
that wasn't the hard part.

1121
01:20:19,898 --> 01:20:22,274
A 9-year-old kid with a cash box...

1122
01:20:22,442 --> 01:20:25,402
trying to get from Broadway
all the way to Boyle Heights?

1123
01:20:25,946 --> 01:20:29,156
Every block, I must have fought five,
six kids for that box.

1124
01:20:29,324 --> 01:20:32,868
But I wouldn't let it go. I wouldn't
let anybody take it away from me.

1125
01:20:34,913 --> 01:20:37,373
But you know who finally got that box?

1126
01:20:42,504 --> 01:20:43,671
A cop.

1127
01:20:44,589 --> 01:20:46,257
A dirty cop.

1128
01:20:46,967 --> 01:20:49,510
An eavesdropping fucking cop.

1129
01:20:55,475 --> 01:20:57,351
That bug's a nifty piece of work.

1130
01:20:59,104 --> 01:21:00,604
Limited range, though.

1131
01:21:11,032 --> 01:21:13,200
I'm not angry. That's done.

1132
01:21:13,660 --> 01:21:15,661
This is business.

1133
01:21:43,607 --> 01:21:45,316
Don't you worry, Grace.

1134
01:21:45,483 --> 01:21:46,942
I'll get you out of town safe.

1135
01:21:47,110 --> 01:21:49,653
I don't want out of town, Jack.
I want out of this life.

1136
01:21:49,821 --> 01:21:52,615
Jack.

1137
01:21:55,035 --> 01:21:56,744
- You stay here.
- Jack.

1138
01:22:03,168 --> 01:22:04,376
Where is she, Jack?

1139
01:22:04,794 --> 01:22:07,546
Where's that gorgeous red snatch?

1140
01:22:07,923 --> 01:22:09,048
She's not here, Mickey.

1141
01:22:09,215 --> 01:22:11,842
Did you bring your trouble boys
just to see Grace?

1142
01:22:12,010 --> 01:22:13,761
You expecting some trouble, Mickey?

1143
01:22:14,262 --> 01:22:15,429
You looking for some?

1144
01:22:15,597 --> 01:22:17,556
My dog, Mickey, Jr...

1145
01:22:17,974 --> 01:22:20,601
he shits more trouble
than you're gonna give me.

1146
01:22:20,769 --> 01:22:22,519
We'll see about that?

1147
01:22:22,771 --> 01:22:24,021
Make it good, boys?

1148
01:22:24,189 --> 01:22:25,189
You? You?

1149
01:22:32,656 --> 01:22:33,989
Come here.

1150
01:22:40,288 --> 01:22:42,164
You're up next, you little creep.

1151
01:22:43,083 --> 01:22:45,542
I've been saving something special
for you, Mickey.

1152
01:22:47,003 --> 01:22:49,713
My boxing days are over, Jack.

1153
01:22:50,715 --> 01:22:53,300
Come on, Mickey.

1154
01:22:58,974 --> 01:23:01,141
- Does that hurt?
- Fuck you, Mickey.

1155
01:23:50,233 --> 01:23:51,358
John.

1156
01:23:52,193 --> 01:23:54,820
- Damn it, John, don't do this.
- Stay out of it, Jerry.

1157
01:23:54,988 --> 01:23:55,988
Just listen to me.

1158
01:23:57,240 --> 01:24:00,993
You goddamn suicidal son of a bitch.
You want to hit something, you hit me.

1159
01:24:01,161 --> 01:24:03,620
- Get out of my way!
- You want to hit something, hit...

1160
01:24:12,881 --> 01:24:14,298
Mickey!

1161
01:24:14,841 --> 01:24:16,091
Cohen!

1162
01:24:17,594 --> 01:24:19,094
Come on!

1163
01:24:35,028 --> 01:24:36,403
Well, sarge...

1164
01:24:39,074 --> 01:24:40,824
this is where I get off.

1165
01:26:03,867 --> 01:26:08,412
The papers are calling for my resignation.

1166
01:26:09,247 --> 01:26:13,333
And the mayor, I'm afraid,
is calling for your head.

1167
01:26:14,169 --> 01:26:18,255
I will likely be replaced by someone
more amenable to Cohen.

1168
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:22,634
And you, sergeant,
you'll be relieved of your duty.

1169
01:26:23,261 --> 01:26:27,347
Your career with the Los Angeles
Police Department is over.

1170
01:26:29,934 --> 01:26:31,602
As for your comrades...

1171
01:26:31,769 --> 01:26:33,729
They were following my orders, sir.

1172
01:26:34,939 --> 01:26:36,356
Blame rests solely with me.

1173
01:26:40,069 --> 01:26:42,237
You've served with distinction.

1174
01:26:43,281 --> 01:26:44,656
I'm sorry, John.

1175
01:26:45,533 --> 01:26:46,909
He won.

1176
01:27:15,355 --> 01:27:17,105
- Here, come here.
- No.

1177
01:27:17,273 --> 01:27:19,900
It's okay, it's okay. It's okay.

1178
01:27:42,632 --> 01:27:44,925
If I leave, Keeler died for nothing.

1179
01:27:45,093 --> 01:27:48,595
Is that what you want me to tell our son
when he asks about his father?

1180
01:28:01,609 --> 01:28:02,609
Connie!

1181
01:28:42,317 --> 01:28:44,401
The war taught us how to fight.

1182
01:28:45,778 --> 01:28:47,779
And, God knows, it was worth it.

1183
01:28:50,074 --> 01:28:53,452
But now it's all I know how to do.

1184
01:28:54,662 --> 01:28:56,538
I don't know how to live.

1185
01:28:57,957 --> 01:28:59,750
I just know how to fight.

1186
01:29:03,671 --> 01:29:05,422
Might as well be Mickey Cohen.

1187
01:29:06,632 --> 01:29:08,258
You're a good man, John.

1188
01:29:09,260 --> 01:29:11,553
You might even be a fucking angel.

1189
01:29:18,936 --> 01:29:20,771
Either way you're a hero.

1190
01:29:22,690 --> 01:29:26,902
You lose everything and you win the war...

1191
01:29:27,070 --> 01:29:28,362
you're a hero.

1192
01:29:30,490 --> 01:29:33,867
You lose everything and you lose the war...

1193
01:29:39,290 --> 01:29:40,874
you're just a fool.

1194
01:30:09,987 --> 01:30:12,155
I've been looking for you everywhere.

1195
01:30:15,868 --> 01:30:16,993
Gracie.

1196
01:30:19,956 --> 01:30:22,624
- I heard about Jack and I just thought...
- I know.

1197
01:30:27,255 --> 01:30:28,672
Jack saved my life.

1198
01:30:29,507 --> 01:30:31,007
He fought like hell.

1199
01:30:32,135 --> 01:30:33,885
What are you doing here?

1200
01:30:35,513 --> 01:30:37,264
I saw Cohen kill him.

1201
01:30:37,932 --> 01:30:40,684
Well, that's all the more reason
for you to get out of here.

1202
01:30:40,852 --> 01:30:42,185
No, I'm a witness.

1203
01:30:42,353 --> 01:30:44,354
- Gracie. Listen to me...
- I'm a witness.

1204
01:30:44,522 --> 01:30:46,398
I'm your witness, Jerry.

1205
01:30:48,776 --> 01:30:50,068
Gracie.

1206
01:30:50,403 --> 01:30:51,820
Let me.

1207
01:31:03,166 --> 01:31:05,292
Excuse me. Do I know you?

1208
01:31:05,460 --> 01:31:06,751
Need a favor, judge.

1209
01:31:06,919 --> 01:31:09,963
See, we've been bugging Cohen's house
for a while now.

1210
01:31:10,131 --> 01:31:13,842
Which I understand is illegal
and inadmissible in court.

1211
01:31:14,010 --> 01:31:16,595
But we don't think the papers
are gonna be so choosy.

1212
01:31:16,762 --> 01:31:20,140
Mickey's boys get pinched, you cut
them loose, he pays you in whores.

1213
01:31:20,308 --> 01:31:22,392
- That sound familiar?
- What do you want?

1214
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:24,394
You're gonna retire, judge.

1215
01:31:24,562 --> 01:31:26,730
But before you do, just this once...

1216
01:31:27,273 --> 01:31:29,191
you're gonna do something right.

1217
01:31:30,610 --> 01:31:31,610
Sign it.

1218
01:31:32,195 --> 01:31:33,737
Come on, sign it.

1219
01:31:36,824 --> 01:31:39,326
I hope you boys know
what you're getting into.

1220
01:31:40,203 --> 01:31:41,578
Where is he?

1221
01:31:41,746 --> 01:31:44,122
He's holed up at the Park Plaza Hotel.

1222
01:31:44,290 --> 01:31:48,043
Rented out every room in the place
and it's a fortress.

1223
01:31:48,211 --> 01:31:50,086
You'll never get him out of there.

1224
01:31:53,049 --> 01:31:54,841
Tomorrow, they'll take my badge.

1225
01:31:55,801 --> 01:31:57,469
Tonight, I'm still a cop.

1226
01:31:58,429 --> 01:32:02,349
I have here an arrest warrant for
Mickey Cohen for the crime of murder.

1227
01:32:04,227 --> 01:32:05,685
I'm bringing him in.

1228
01:32:06,062 --> 01:32:08,355
Think I'll tag along
if you don't mind, sarge.

1229
01:32:09,649 --> 01:32:11,525
I got no plans tonight.

1230
01:32:12,860 --> 01:32:13,860
I'm in.

1231
01:32:14,111 --> 01:32:15,362
Let's finish it.

1232
01:32:22,662 --> 01:32:24,871
Ole buttermilk sky
I'ma telling you why

1233
01:32:25,039 --> 01:32:28,542
Now you know
Keep it in mind tonight

1234
01:32:28,709 --> 01:32:32,504
I just got off the phone with Judge Carter.
He says he signed the warrant himself.

1235
01:32:32,672 --> 01:32:34,256
Who's gonna serve it?

1236
01:32:34,423 --> 01:32:36,299
Five guys? Forget it.

1237
01:32:37,009 --> 01:32:38,718
They'll never get through the lobby.

1238
01:32:50,606 --> 01:32:52,065
- Beat it.
- Get inside.

1239
01:32:58,906 --> 01:33:01,575
Think I'll dance with the one
what brung me.

1240
01:33:05,580 --> 01:33:07,122
Mickey Cohen...

1241
01:33:07,999 --> 01:33:12,127
this is Sergeant John O'Mara of the
Los Angeles Police Department.

1242
01:33:12,587 --> 01:33:14,337
We have a warrant for your arrest.

1243
01:33:15,006 --> 01:33:19,801
Come out quietly with your hands up
and you will not be harmed.

1244
01:33:21,012 --> 01:33:24,222
Mickey Cohen,
this is your final warning.

1245
01:33:24,390 --> 01:33:26,516
I like having only one fork.

1246
01:33:27,643 --> 01:33:29,811
You never make the wrong decision.

1247
01:33:30,521 --> 01:33:31,521
Fucking had it.

1248
01:33:31,689 --> 01:33:34,482
All right, Cohen, time's up!
We're coming in!

1249
01:33:35,234 --> 01:33:36,818
We got a better idea, coppers.

1250
01:33:36,986 --> 01:33:38,528
Why don't you take your guns...

1251
01:33:38,696 --> 01:33:40,822
and shove them up your asses.

1252
01:33:42,158 --> 01:33:43,742
You call it, sarge.

1253
01:33:46,162 --> 01:33:47,162
Light them up!

1254
01:33:52,918 --> 01:33:54,794
Dirty stinking copper!

1255
01:33:55,046 --> 01:33:56,546
- Where you hiding?
- Clear!

1256
01:34:01,636 --> 01:34:02,844
Cover me!

1257
01:34:50,726 --> 01:34:52,602
We gotta take out that gun!

1258
01:34:54,355 --> 01:34:55,397
Watch this, hoss!

1259
01:35:39,608 --> 01:35:41,151
I'm out!

1260
01:36:15,311 --> 01:36:18,813
Elmer's got a plane waiting in Burbank,
but we need to leave now, Mick.

1261
01:36:21,233 --> 01:36:22,984
Can I get my tie on?

1262
01:36:24,695 --> 01:36:28,490
Want my fucking tie straight,
I'm gonna go out there in fucking public.

1263
01:36:29,325 --> 01:36:30,575
You all right?

1264
01:36:30,743 --> 01:36:32,118
I'm all right.

1265
01:36:32,912 --> 01:36:34,621
Hold on.

1266
01:36:36,165 --> 01:36:38,249
Go get that son of a bitch.

1267
01:36:53,808 --> 01:36:55,475
That you, O'Mara?

1268
01:36:55,643 --> 01:36:57,393
That's right, coward!

1269
01:36:57,561 --> 01:36:59,103
Come and get it, Cohen.

1270
01:37:01,023 --> 01:37:03,191
Here comes Santy Claus.

1271
01:37:40,354 --> 01:37:42,355
Get the car! Get the car!

1272
01:38:06,213 --> 01:38:07,714
Harris, help me out!

1273
01:38:20,060 --> 01:38:21,519
Come on, let's go!

1274
01:38:26,358 --> 01:38:28,067
Come on! Drive faster!

1275
01:38:30,738 --> 01:38:32,280
Son of a bitch.

1276
01:38:57,431 --> 01:39:00,808
Navidad, come over here and help me aim.

1277
01:39:07,816 --> 01:39:10,985
Remember, not where
the son of a bitch is, goddamn it.

1278
01:39:11,153 --> 01:39:12,862
Where he's gonna be.

1279
01:39:34,385 --> 01:39:36,135
That's my boy.

1280
01:39:50,943 --> 01:39:52,193
Mickey Cohen...

1281
01:39:52,861 --> 01:39:56,572
you're under arrest for the murder
of Jack Whalen.

1282
01:40:00,035 --> 01:40:02,537
All right, lawman, take me in.

1283
01:40:03,247 --> 01:40:04,330
Come on.

1284
01:40:12,673 --> 01:40:14,882
- Wanna dance?
- Yeah.

1285
01:40:15,050 --> 01:40:16,884
All right, come on.

1286
01:40:28,772 --> 01:40:29,981
You're an interrupter.

1287
01:40:30,733 --> 01:40:32,859
An interrupter of progress.

1288
01:40:34,194 --> 01:40:35,361
I'm progress, see?

1289
01:41:01,889 --> 01:41:02,930
Come on.

1290
01:41:28,040 --> 01:41:29,457
Get up! Get up!

1291
01:41:31,251 --> 01:41:33,294
Come on. Come on.

1292
01:41:50,104 --> 01:41:51,395
That's Mickey Cohen.

1293
01:42:03,951 --> 01:42:05,451
Take him away.

1294
01:42:08,705 --> 01:42:09,705
All right, let's go.

1295
01:42:15,838 --> 01:42:18,256
Every man carries a badge.

1296
01:42:18,423 --> 01:42:21,717
Mickey Cohen pledged allegiance
to his own power.

1297
01:42:21,885 --> 01:42:25,179
Violence was his means and his end.

1298
01:42:25,848 --> 01:42:30,434
When he was sent to Alcatraz, friends of
Jack Whalen welcomed him with a lead pipe.

1299
01:42:33,480 --> 01:42:38,151
Parker stayed on as chief of police
until his death in 1966.

1300
01:42:38,485 --> 01:42:41,070
He got credit for Cohen's downfall.

1301
01:42:41,321 --> 01:42:43,948
No one ever spoke of the Gangster Squad.

1302
01:42:45,075 --> 01:42:50,413
The reign of the gangster Mickey Cohen
in Los Angeles is at an end.

1303
01:42:50,706 --> 01:42:52,665
Parker deserved the praise.

1304
01:42:52,833 --> 01:42:56,210
In tough times, he'd kept his oath
to protect and serve...

1305
01:42:56,920 --> 01:43:00,423
just like the thousands who walk
their beats every day.

1306
01:43:00,591 --> 01:43:02,258
Maybe without glory...

1307
01:43:02,426 --> 01:43:04,093
but with pride and honor.

1308
01:43:05,596 --> 01:43:09,223
We brought Cohen in, but it was
Grace's testimony that put him away.

1309
01:43:09,975 --> 01:43:13,644
After the trial, she held on to Jerry
and wouldn't let go.

1310
01:43:14,104 --> 01:43:18,191
Jerry always threatened to leave
the force, but he never did.

1311
01:43:18,609 --> 01:43:22,361
I guess he couldn't shake
the call of duty that echoed in his ears.

1312
01:43:23,989 --> 01:43:28,242
Every man carries a badge,
and this was mine.

1313
01:43:29,161 --> 01:43:31,287
But it was time to put it away.

1314
01:43:32,706 --> 01:43:36,000
The mob has never had
a foothold in Los Angeles.

1315
01:43:36,168 --> 01:43:38,920
I'd like to think I played
a small role in that.

1316
01:43:40,214 --> 01:43:44,342
I may not be in the line of fire anymore,
but I still love my town.

1317
01:43:45,761 --> 01:43:47,637
It's not paradise...

1318
01:43:48,096 --> 01:43:49,847
but it is the City of Angels.
