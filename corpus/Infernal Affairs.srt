1
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,280
5 years ago

2
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:16,840
we started valet parking in Tuen Mun

3
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:21,880
We were full of ambition

4
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,720
But 2 weeks had hardly gone by

5
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,920
and the cops started busting us every day

6
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,080
Within one year

7
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,680
6 of our brothers died

8
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,240
Thanks to the Buddha, my life was spared

9
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,760
What thousands must die
so that Caesar may become great

10
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,320
But I don't believe in destiny

11
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:08,600
The rule of this game
is to take fate in our own hands

12
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,800
You are the newest in my gang

13
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,480
Your records are the cleanest

14
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:21,040
You can choose your own future

15
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,480
OK

16
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,120
I wish you guys

17
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,240
every success in the police force

18
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,520
Bottoms up, officers

19
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,840
27149, you were here 10 minutes ago

20
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,240
How many files were on my desk?

21
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,600
Six, sir. Four beige ones on the left

22
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,800
one red and one white on the right

23
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,880
What do you think of me?

24
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,280
Sorry, I'm not sure, sir

25
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,040
But I know you're in a hurry today

26
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,600
'coz your socks don't match

27
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,200
27149, you can go now

28
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,360
Yes, sir

29
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,800
You owe me $500

30
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,960
OK, but wait till pay day next month

31
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,320
I told you he would make the best
undercover cop

32
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,360
Now that you're in the cadet school
you should follow the rules

33
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,720
Those who break the rules will be
like him

34
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,920
They will be expelled

35
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,080
Who wants to trade place with him?

36
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,600
I do

37
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,160
Your records in the cadet school
will be erased

38
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,000
Only Superintendent Wong and
I know of your identity

39
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:26,760
This mission is highly dangerous
is that clear?

40
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:27,920
Yes, sir

41
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,600
Sir, I can't stand it any longer

42
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:35,160
I'm either harassed by cops
or beaten up by gangsters

43
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,560
4927, you are still a rookie

44
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,200
Give me a good reason
why I should promote you

45
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,400
Hang on?
Why don't you go hang yourself instead?

46
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,560
I won the Silver Whistle Award
at the cadet

47
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,320
and have received numerous kudos as
an officer

48
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,720
I am confident I can lead the police force
sir

49
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,360
Boss

50
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,840
OK, I got it

51
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,040
Move forward

52
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,360
Hurry up

53
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,560
Please go over there to take your mugshot

54
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,240
Excuse me

55
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,680
Can I try this stereo?

56
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,520
What speakers are you using?

57
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,000
Nothing special, any recommendations?

58
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:11,280
Try this tube amplifier
made in Hong Kong, 10,000 only

59
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,640
And use this cable, also locally made
about 1000

60
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,120
The sound is as good as expensive
European amps

61
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,200
Sweet high notes, crisp middle
strong bass

62
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,400
In a word, transparent

63
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,360
Come and listen

64
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,400
Human voices are drifting towards you

65
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,920
See that?

66
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,840
Voices are indeed drifting towards you

67
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,760
Try this one

68
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,280
This is ideal for listening to oldies

69
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,080
What do you think?

70
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,560
Much better indeed

71
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,880
Any discount if I buy the whole set?

72
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,720
Buy the tube amp here

73
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,520
but not the speakers

74
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,680
Go to Cheung Wai; it's cheaper there

75
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,800
Whom should I ask for?

76
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,120
Just tell them Yan sent you

77
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,360
Which one is mine?

78
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,280
The one in the middle

79
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,880
Okay, thanks

80
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,120
You're welcome

81
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,440
Is Cheung Wai open yet?

82
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,600
Sure

83
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,360
You bastard

84
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,640
I told you to watch the store
not to send my customers away

85
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,680
But your speakers are over-priced

86
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,640
If I don't sell them at this price
how can I afford to pay "protection money"?

87
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,520
You can try not paying for a change

88
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,400
Hey, the cable

89
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,360
I'll return it in a few days

90
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,600
$4,000 for a few days?

91
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,560
Where are you rushing to?

92
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:58,720
A funeral

93
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:27,960
Tell me

94
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,320
How many times have you been busted
for assault?

95
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,400
I am trying to convince
the Department of Justice

96
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,720
that you need to see a shrink

97
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,160
But you keep on beating people up

98
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,840
Are you really going nuts?

99
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,920
Have you forgotten you're a cop?

100
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:49,360
You told me it's only for 3 years

101
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,240
But after 3 years come another 3 years
and another

102
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,600
It's almost 10 years already, boss

103
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,000
Can't you be a bit more courteous to me?

104
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,720
I'm the only one in Hong Kong
who knows your real identity now

105
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:05,440
Maybe I'll just erase your file
so you can stick with the Triads for good

106
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,040
What do you want me to do?

107
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,480
Remind myself I'm a cop every day?

108
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,800
Shouting "Drop your gun, I'm a cop"
even in my dreams?

109
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,560
When will Sam place his order?

110
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,720
No idea

111
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,080
Sometime this week

112
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:33,960
What?

113
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,320
Sometime this week

114
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,280
The Thais are here

115
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,400
Once the goods arrive
Sam will resell them

116
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,200
Where is the warehouse?

117
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,240
How the hell do I know?

118
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,040
I started working for him only 3 years ago

119
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,240
OK, I'll let you retire after this

120
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,560
Bullshit
I heard this a zillion times already

121
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,600
Shit. These mikes again?

122
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,760
The Police is loaded with cash
Tell them to get more advanced models

123
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,240
How about implanting it into your body?

124
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,360
Into which part of my body?

125
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,920
A pinhole camera?

126
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,640
Where's the lens?

127
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,720
Your birthday is on the 25th, right?

128
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,080
I never wear watches

129
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:20,280
If we got nothing for the lnterpol by 5pm

130
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,520
the counterfeit passport case is off

131
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,960
3:15. Tea time

132
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,440
What would you like, boss?

133
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:27,960
Tea with milk, please

134
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,280
They won't talk without their attorney

135
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,440
Has paged their lawyers
but he hasn't called back yet

136
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,800
I won't talk without my attorney

137
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,720
I am Mr. Lau, your attorney

138
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,800
Did you call home?

139
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,040
Why should I call home?

140
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,920
It's good then

141
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:25,160
Where were you last friday
from 3:45 to 5:00 pm?

142
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:29,000
Brother Mo told me to ask you
if your family needs any help

143
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,960
No need to look around

144
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,680
They won't record anything
when a lawyer is present

145
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,920
It's not admissible in court anyway

146
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,600
Brother Mo sent you?

147
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,480
Those 2 kids next door

148
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,720
have squealed on the workshop already

149
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,320
Cops are heading there now

150
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:01,720
Brother Mo told you not to say anything

151
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,800
If your brother is there
tell him to leave right away

152
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:09,840
Here

153
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,640
What?

154
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,160
Scram

155
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,480
I ask you to scram, do you hear?

156
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,200
Scram right away

157
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,680
All right. I'll leave you

158
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,880
If you don't trust me, so be it

159
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,920
Take care

160
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,160
Remember
don't talk without your attorney

161
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,640
I don't need you to tell me that

162
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,200
Fanny

163
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,000
Yes?

164
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:56,800
Take this

165
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,040
Check this number

166
00:15:59,200 --> 00:15:59,960
Sure

167
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,280
Send this message for me

168
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,360
Cheung Fai lndustrial Building, 2nd Floor

169
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:16,360
Cheung Fai lndustrial Building, 2nd Floor
OK

170
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,080
Boss

171
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,280
All set

172
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,640
A Triad member

173
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,080
Where's my tea?

174
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:21,880
Here

175
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:22,880
Thanks

176
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,640
You're great

177
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,280
How did you know it's Mo's hideout?

178
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,120
Thanks

179
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,080
Hello, yes

180
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,760
No problem. OK

181
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,640
Sorry guys, over time tonight

182
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,080
Our target tonight is a drug trafficking
cartel

183
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:04,440
In an hour's time
they will be trading with a Thai seller

184
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:07,280
Cash will be handed over in the building
across the street

185
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,720
in a unit on the 3rd floor

186
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,760
Where the goods will be delivered is
still unknown

187
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:20,120
CIB shall tag the target
and tap the phone lines

188
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:25,960
Our unit will not take action till
our mole has pinned down the delivery location

189
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,800
Let's take a look at our principal stars

190
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,240
Here are our principal stars tonight:

191
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,920
Hon Sam, Chen Wing-yan, Del Piero

192
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,560
We've been watching them for a long time

193
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,000
We'd better nail them tonight

194
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,520
OK? No more questions?

195
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,400
Let's get to work

196
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,160
Sorry for paging you so urgently

197
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,760
But our mission is kept confidential till
the last moment

198
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:07,600
No problem

199
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,440
Do you have confidence?

200
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:09,920
Yes, it should be OK

201
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:10,840
Hello, Dad

202
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,160
Pass the phone to Dad

203
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,600
I can't come home for dinner

204
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,840
Too bad
Dinner has been prepared already

205
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,760
Call me when you're back
I'll heat it up for you

206
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,760
You look so relaxed

207
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,760
It's only work
We can always work on it next time

208
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,240
Sorry

209
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,880
All cell phone signals in this area
are under surveillance

210
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,760
SP Wong

211
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,560
SP Wong, which channel?

212
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,120
Channel 454870

213
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,320
Channel 454870

214
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,320
Attention. Our prey is in sight

215
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,080
Big Brother

216
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,320
Boss

217
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:14,960
Take out all your cell phones

218
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,760
You two, go get the car

219
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,720
Wait

220
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,480
Yan

221
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,560
escort the Thais here

222
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,840
You two, follow me

223
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:40,920
Lau

224
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:41,920
Yes

225
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,240
Did Sam and his gang make any calls?

226
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,480
No. They probably changed their phones

227
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,760
Let's search randomly for calls
made from this area

228
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,120
Searching

229
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,440
Some 6,500 cell phones

230
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,440
are being connected in this area right now

231
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:57,760
267 cell phones are making calls
on this street alone

232
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,480
Give me 10 minutes

233
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,440
Good

234
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:01,880
Thank you

235
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,280
Did they spot us?

236
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,800
Are those two over there watching us?

237
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,760
Which two?

238
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,400
Those two

239
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,000
No one is watching you

240
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:22,080
Those two making out over there

241
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,760
They are just making out
Why would they be watching you?

242
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:25,920
You think you're a movie star?

243
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,600
Our prey is back

244
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:30,840
Yip, watch our prey closely

245
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,400
Boss. The Thais are here

246
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,520
Hey man

247
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:47,280
What's up?

248
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,840
How are you?

249
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,560
Cigar?

250
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,080
Is that any good?

251
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,880
Excellent

252
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,040
Is it cold in Hong Kong?

253
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,800
Very cold

254
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,800
You even know how to speak Cantonese

255
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,320
How fantastic

256
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,480
Marvelous indeed

257
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,760
AA+

258
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,760
Deal

259
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,640
Automobile license plate number HN397
is taking off

260
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,680
Repeat, Helen, Nelson
HN397 is taking off

261
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:04,920
Attention. HN397 is taking off

262
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,240
Repeat, Helen, Nelson, 397

263
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,560
Should we send a car to tail them?

264
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,880
Elephant
Kwai Chung Container Terminus

265
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,360
Roger

266
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,920
Piero. You're being tailed

267
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,120
Lead them in circles

268
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,320
They know which channel we are on

269
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,600
Switch to channel 456855

270
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,520
Boss, where are those two going?

271
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:05,600
Don't worry, take it easy

272
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,800
Take care of the Thais for me

273
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:32,840
Sorry, sir

274
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,400
Hello?

275
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,920
Why don't you use the walkie talkie?
We've switched channels?

276
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,000
Are you done yet?

277
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,200
Beat it

278
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,600
Piero, are you being tailed?

279
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,800
Keep driving around

280
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:19,720
Cheung

281
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:23,200
Use the current channel to tell Elephant
that action has been cancelled

282
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,240
Yes, sir

283
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,960
Elephant, no hunting tonight

284
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,960
Come back to the station

285
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,200
It's done

286
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,040
What the hell is going on?

287
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,560
Our guys are freezing to death out there

288
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,960
What's so funny?

289
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,080
I speak Thai. I know what they're saying

290
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,200
Really?

291
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:57,040
Yes. They are bitching at the boss

292
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,840
What are they bitching about?

293
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:03,640
Those Thais at Lung Koo Bay
are freezing to death

294
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:07,000
You know they can't stand the cold

295
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,040
That's right

296
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,000
You're sharp

297
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,680
Cheung, call Elephant

298
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,000
Goods to be delivered at Lung Koo Bay

299
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,960
Boss, I found it

300
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:05,040
Tell Keung to check the goods
And make sure no one is around

301
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:07,800
Not a soul

302
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:16,000
A boat is approaching
Probably for checking the goods

303
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,360
The cocaine is all here

304
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,040
Keung, are you an idiot or what?

305
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:29,280
Boss

306
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,400
I heard it

307
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:34,120
Tell Keung to shout a loud
that the cocaine is his

308
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,520
Keung, the Boss

309
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,040
asks you to shout aloud that the cocaine
is yours

310
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,760
The cocaine is yours

311
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,200
Take delivery

312
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,960
They are taking delivery
Get ready for action

313
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,680
Thanks. Thanks

314
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:04,960
Thank you

315
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,240
Double Eight

316
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,160
As soon as the Thais step out, arrest them

317
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,360
There's a stooge. Stop the deal

318
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,000
There's a stooge. Stop the deal

319
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:43,840
Wait

320
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,000
There's a stooge. Stop the deal

321
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,120
Hello?

322
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,600
Cast all the goods into the sea. Now

323
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,800
Keung. Cast all the goods into the sea

324
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,400
Police. Freeze

325
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,040
We got the men but lost the goods

326
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,000
They have cast everything into the sea

327
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,360
Double Eight, hold it

328
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,200
All of you, follow me

329
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,160
What are you looking at?

330
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,040
Boss. Let's...

331
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,840
Police, don't move

332
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,480
Sam

333
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,000
Your food looks good

334
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,240
Not bad

335
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,920
We've straightened it out

336
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,960
Your boys are only strolling on the beach

337
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,440
So they can go now?

338
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:26,960
Sure, any time

339
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,120
We don't want to waste any more of
your precious time

340
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,880
We've known each other for so long
Don't give me that

341
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,920
I haven't had my dinner here
for quite a while

342
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,560
If you like it, you're always welcome here

343
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:36,440
How about tomorrow?

344
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,160
I'll take a rain check

345
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,280
I feel bad coming here empty-handed

346
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,640
Don't stand on ceremonies

347
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,400
I' should feel bad

348
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,520
for making you drop several grand
tonight

349
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,520
You think planting a mole in us will do
us in?

350
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,000
Same here

351
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,720
I remember a story

352
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,240
Two fools are waiting for their
kidney transplants

353
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,600
but only one kidney is available

354
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,840
The two guys thus play a game

355
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:42,080
They each put a playing card
into the other's pocket

356
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:45,800
Whoever guesses the card in his own
pocket wins

357
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,440
You know I can see your card

358
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,160
I think so too

359
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,960
I will beat you

360
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,160
Let's see

361
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,480
We should be more careful

362
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,480
I will

363
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,720
By the way

364
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,960
whoever loses the game will die

365
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,400
Let's see when you're gonna die

366
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:20,440
Ever seen someone shakes
a corpse's hand?

367
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,400
Let's go

368
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:46,720
Put it next to the couch

369
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:47,640
OK

370
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:48,760
Thanks

371
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,560
Mary

372
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,480
What's interior designer's number?

373
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:59,520
The interior designer... 90255047

374
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,920
How many boxes have I counted?

375
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,120
24? Are you sure?

376
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,440
Positive

377
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:11,840
Pass me the phone

378
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,080
Coming

379
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,720
Hello?

380
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:19,800
Hold on please

381
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:20,760
Who is it?

382
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:21,640
I don't know

383
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:22,880
Hello

384
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,000
It's me

385
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,880
Yes, I'm moving in

386
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,040
Don't eavesdrop. It's confidential

387
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:29,920
I lost all of my goods

388
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:31,600
There's a mole

389
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:32,760
Dig him out for me

390
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,360
Hold on, too many people around here

391
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:35,440
Hold on

392
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,360
I have no access to those undercover files
I can't dig him out

393
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:40,920
I don't care how difficult it is

394
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:45,200
I only know he uses Morse codes

395
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:55,640
Give me all the information on the people
around you last night

396
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:59,360
Their real names, ID card no.
account no., etc

397
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,200
See you tonight, at the cinema

398
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,200
OK

399
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:09,560
What's the matter?

400
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,520
I'm talking about my novel

401
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,280
I know what I'm going to write about
Come here

402
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,400
I can write about a man with 28 different
personalities

403
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:27,760
Are you talking about me?

404
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,240
Be more serious

405
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:30,640
Think about it

406
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,640
A man with 28 personalities

407
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,600
That means he starts role playing
the minute he wakes up

408
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:38,200
He is no longer certain
which personality is the real him

409
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,480
Isn't it scary?

410
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,480
Very much

411
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:42,840
Good?

412
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,120
Yeah. Will be a bestseller for sure

413
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:44,880
Wait...

414
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:45,640
What is it?

415
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Why is the ottoman so big?

416
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,400
Which one?

417
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,840
I must have gotten the measurements
wrong

418
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,600
Take it easy

419
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,200
You women...

420
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,200
Let me see. Get up slowly

421
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,120
Don't be mad

422
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:06,800
Meet up?

423
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:07,920
You want me dead?

424
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,560
There's a mole in the police station

425
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,080
Dig him out first

426
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:13,800
So who is he?

427
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,520
I can't talk anymore

428
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,680
What?

429
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,520
Just now?

430
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,160
I was at a Chinese chiropractor

431
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,040
I'm seeing the shrink now

432
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,640
I'm going psycho. That's it

433
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:26,800
This chair is really... incredible

434
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,560
You should get one for yourself?

435
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,480
So you don't need to come here
and sleep every time

436
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,200
It's more comfortable here

437
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,800
Don't be so peevish

438
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:38,360
During these 4 months, if it weren't for me

439
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,360
you wouldn't have the time to play

440
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,800
It's 5 months
computer games

441
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,440
In one more month
your mandatory therapy will be over

442
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,120
You can sleep peacefully at home then

443
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,840
So soon?

444
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:55,480
I don't seem to have improved at all

445
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,480
Why don't you just prolong my treatment

446
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:02,520
Besides, my head is splitting these days

447
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,520
Could it be schizophrenia?

448
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,800
This is called "headache"
I'll prescribe some Panadol for you

449
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,960
Actually
there's something I want to ask you

450
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,560
but...

451
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,560
it's kind of embarrassing

452
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,160
What do you think of me?

453
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,400
Do you think I'm a good guy or a bad guy?

454
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,200
I hardly know who you are

455
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:39,640
Tell you a secret, but don't tell anyone

456
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,480
I'm actually a cop

457
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:51,840
So am I

458
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,920
Let's continue next week

459
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,680
Try to remember your dreams

460
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,600
Of course

461
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:06,520
I will dream about you

462
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,360
See you next week

463
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,480
Just Panadol?

464
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,120
Bye

465
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,520
Your promotion should be OK

466
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,560
You will be transferred to lnternal Affairs

467
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,640
but you will work at OCTB

468
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:36,440
I don't understand

469
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:41,040
I suspect Sam has a mole
in the department

470
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,320
I want you to investigate

471
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:43,880
Why me?

472
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:47,600
We have scrutinized all possible
candidates

473
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,400
You have an immaculate record

474
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,880
You have solved many cases in CIB

475
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:56,160
Working in IA, you will get in touch
with senior officials

476
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,920
That's a good opportunity

477
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:01,800
I've arranged for you to appear on TV

478
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,480
Remember to spruce up a bit

479
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:07,960
When will I meet the Board?

480
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:09,720
You just did

481
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:13,960
Come, take a stab

482
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,160
Thanks

483
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,040
By the way

484
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,800
how's the wedding?

485
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,320
Everything's on schedule

486
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,240
That's good

487
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:30,480
You'll be more stable after marriage

488
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:32,120
Your image will improve too

489
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,160
You have chance of further promotion

490
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,120
Yes, broaden your horizon

491
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,880
Fill in your real name

492
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:45,240
This is my real name

493
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,240
You don't know Del Piero is my real name?

494
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,120
Is that so?

495
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,200
Yes

496
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,080
What are you guys writing?

497
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:02,360
The Boss told us to fill in these forms

498
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:05,080
Must be setting up mandatory
provident funds for us

499
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,320
You know, MPF

500
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,120
Are you serious?

501
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,760
You don't know to spell BODYGUARD?

502
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:12,480
Isn't it supposed to look like this?

503
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:13,880
Of course not

504
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,680
Should be B-O-D-Y-G-A-R-D

505
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,080
That's it

506
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
A shipment will come in next week

507
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:58,560
They are watching closely

508
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,800
You do what you need to do

509
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:03,280
I'll handle the rest

510
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,320
The file is open. I'm afraid I can't handle it

511
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,480
So you're not worried about me

512
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,000
You are worried about yourself
lnspector Lau

513
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,680
Those girls are so ugly

514
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,320
I'll take care of it as soon as I can

515
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:31,680
Hello?

516
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,600
I'm on my way back

517
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:20,000
Yan

518
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:22,840
How long have you worked for me?

519
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:24,920
3 or 4 years already

520
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:26,520
That long?

521
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:28,440
Doesn't seem that long to me

522
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:33,480
I have another shipment next week

523
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:34,800
But this time

524
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:38,320
I'm using some tough, new faces

525
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:39,640
So you guys can rest

526
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:44,480
Even Keung and the others?

527
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:46,360
Keung?

528
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:51,200
Don't you know he's nuts?

529
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,760
There's a mole within us. You know that?

530
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:12,680
What do you think we should do?

531
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:15,280
I'll take care of it

532
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:17,320
How?

533
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:32,040
I'll find out who he is in a couple of days
Get ready for action

534
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:35,840
Yan

535
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:40,280
Of all the brothers, I trust you the most

536
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:06,680
Lau

537
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:14,760
No, thanks

538
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:21,000
These folks

539
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:23,480
You know most of them
no need for introduction, right?

540
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:26,800
No, but...

541
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:27,920
they are so...

542
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:32,480
Who doesn't know you're sent here
to find the mole?

543
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:34,560
What do you want them to do?
Pour you a cup of coffee?

544
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:37,960
Only an idiot will not be envied, right?

545
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:40,760
They all want to know who the mole is

546
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:42,760
Just tell me whom you want to investigate

547
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:43,680
OK

548
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:45,640
Any clues?

549
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:49,280
Two days ago, my informer

550
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:51,640
nearly found out who he was

551
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:54,560
Too bad he lost him

552
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:56,440
But if Sam is getting a new shipment
he must contact the mole again

553
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:58,640
Just follow Sam and we'll get
what we want

554
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,600
That's right. I've much to learn from you

555
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Don't say that

556
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:05,640
Our seniors sent you here
because they think you can do it

557
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:07,760
Not everyone can handle IA tasks

558
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:08,760
It's stuffy here

559
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:10,120
Let's get out of here

560
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:12,360
The coffee here is the best
in the headquarters

561
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:13,400
I'll pour you a cup

562
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:41,200
My informer nearly found out
who the mole was

563
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:42,920
But if Sam is getting a new shipment

564
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,000
he must contact the mole again

565
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:48,320
Yes?

566
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:50,640
Hey

567
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:52,120
The bed has arrived

568
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:53,920
Is that so? Comfortable?

569
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,040
You want to try it?

570
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:58,760
Don't be silly. I have work to do

571
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,160
Think about it

572
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:04,920
No, I can't

573
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:05,880
Come on

574
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:07,000
Saturday

575
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:08,600
I'll be free next Saturday
We can try it then

576
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:10,280
OK

577
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:11,360
OK, next Saturday then

578
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:11,960
Bye

579
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:12,960
Bye

580
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:17,720
Up already?

581
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:18,960
Yes

582
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:22,680
We just tested the bed
and you are working again?

583
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:25,080
I'm very hardworking

584
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:27,120
What are you writing now?

585
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:28,600
Here

586
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:32,880
The more I think of it, the more
pathetic the main character appears

587
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:34,400
Pathetic indeed

588
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:36,800
Perhaps I should make him a happier guy

589
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:37,840
Good

590
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:39,680
Should I turn him into a good guy?

591
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:45,240
Even though he is good
he has done bad things

592
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:46,640
So how should it end?

593
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:47,682
That's a good question

594
00:49:48,002 --> 00:49:50,044
I'll leave this to you writers

595
00:49:51,045 --> 00:49:52,647
You're not going to sleep?
Help me, please

596
00:49:52,887 --> 00:49:54,729
Help me, please?

597
00:49:55,049 --> 00:49:55,930
I can't

598
00:49:56,170 --> 00:49:58,052
Go to sleep. You are tired

599
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:18,202
From now on

600
00:50:18,482 --> 00:50:19,523
follow SP Wong around the clock

601
00:50:22,926 --> 00:50:27,130
Piero, I know how to spot a plainclothes

602
00:50:27,931 --> 00:50:28,812
How?

603
00:50:29,132 --> 00:50:30,694
If he seems to be doing something

604
00:50:30,894 --> 00:50:33,096
but is paying attention to us instead

605
00:50:33,576 --> 00:50:34,858
then he is a cop

606
00:50:54,276 --> 00:50:55,917
Is that so?

607
00:50:56,798 --> 00:50:57,759
Then the whole place is filled with cops

608
00:50:57,999 --> 00:50:59,160
They're everywhere

609
00:51:08,649 --> 00:51:09,490
Yan

610
00:51:10,331 --> 00:51:11,131
Boss

611
00:51:25,345 --> 00:51:26,265
Watching something?

612
00:51:26,666 --> 00:51:27,667
You are a cop

613
00:51:28,588 --> 00:51:30,670
We are guessing who a cop is

614
00:51:31,270 --> 00:51:32,952
How trivial

615
00:51:34,954 --> 00:51:35,874
I'm going for a massage, wanna come?

616
00:51:36,075 --> 00:51:37,035
I hate it

617
00:51:37,836 --> 00:51:38,957
Don't tell

618
00:51:40,719 --> 00:51:41,680
Tell on him

619
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:42,681
I won't

620
00:51:49,847 --> 00:51:50,808
What a coincidence

621
00:51:51,009 --> 00:51:53,171
Yes, I was shopping in the hood

622
00:51:54,211 --> 00:51:55,293
Haven't seen you for ages

623
00:51:56,534 --> 00:51:57,855
6 or 7 years already

624
00:52:00,577 --> 00:52:01,538
How are you?

625
00:52:02,179 --> 00:52:04,421
I'm married. How about you?

626
00:52:04,861 --> 00:52:07,063
Still working in...?

627
00:52:13,029 --> 00:52:13,950
Mommy

628
00:52:17,073 --> 00:52:17,874
Your daughter?

629
00:52:18,034 --> 00:52:18,874
Yes

630
00:52:21,437 --> 00:52:22,318
How old is she?

631
00:52:22,598 --> 00:52:23,519
5 years old

632
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:28,323
I'm waiting for my husband's car, so...

633
00:52:28,764 --> 00:52:29,805
I'm also in a hurry

634
00:52:30,685 --> 00:52:31,406
Bye

635
00:52:31,446 --> 00:52:32,447
Bye

636
00:52:36,211 --> 00:52:38,693
Mommy, I'm 6 already

637
00:52:39,053 --> 00:52:41,496
Sorry, I always get it wrong

638
00:53:15,527 --> 00:53:16,448
Where are you now?

639
00:53:16,608 --> 00:53:17,449
On my way

640
00:53:26,017 --> 00:53:26,698
Hello?

641
00:53:27,458 --> 00:53:30,301
Boss, he is taking the subway

642
00:53:32,183 --> 00:53:33,024
Keep following him

643
00:53:54,924 --> 00:53:58,207
Boss, he has gone to the 24th floor

644
00:53:58,487 --> 00:53:59,688
Stay put. Don't do anything rash

645
00:54:15,663 --> 00:54:17,305
Boss, we've got him

646
00:54:19,427 --> 00:54:20,268
I don't know yet

647
00:54:20,828 --> 00:54:22,149
But I know where he is now

648
00:54:29,036 --> 00:54:30,117
Keep watch over here

649
00:54:46,852 --> 00:54:48,214
So? Any good news?

650
00:54:48,454 --> 00:54:49,375
A shipment will come in next week

651
00:54:49,615 --> 00:54:50,816
Time and location yet to be confirmed

652
00:54:51,417 --> 00:54:53,058
I still don't know who Sam's mole is

653
00:54:53,419 --> 00:54:55,300
but he seems confident he can blow
my cover

654
00:54:57,663 --> 00:54:59,104
In that case

655
00:55:04,749 --> 00:55:06,791
we'd better stop it
We're gonna lose for sure

656
00:55:07,472 --> 00:55:08,713
You are kidding, right?

657
00:55:08,953 --> 00:55:11,115
What else can we do? It's deadly business

658
00:55:13,277 --> 00:55:19,002
Hello?

659
00:55:19,203 --> 00:55:20,123
Boss said he had found the mole
He told us to take care of him

660
00:55:21,565 --> 00:55:22,486
I'll be right there

661
00:55:42,304 --> 00:55:43,185
Hello?

662
00:55:44,466 --> 00:55:45,067
Keep an eye on SP Wong

663
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:01,642
You two, take the stairs

664
00:56:02,523 --> 00:56:03,924
Keung, take the elevator

665
00:56:05,125 --> 00:56:06,487
Anyone knows you're seeing me today?

666
00:56:06,647 --> 00:56:07,367
No

667
00:56:07,648 --> 00:56:08,649
They are downstairs now

668
00:56:35,994 --> 00:56:36,915
What are you doing?

669
00:56:37,315 --> 00:56:38,436
Put it away

670
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:04,621
Take the window-washing scaffolding

671
00:57:04,781 --> 00:57:05,622
How about you?

672
00:57:06,182 --> 00:57:07,183
I'll take the elevator

673
00:57:09,305 --> 00:57:10,226
Be careful

674
00:57:14,350 --> 00:57:15,231
Nothing

675
00:57:52,906 --> 00:57:55,749
Darling, the apartment is superb

676
00:57:55,949 --> 00:57:58,591
A 180-degree window facing
the golf course

677
00:57:58,871 --> 00:58:00,313
plus club membership costs less than
a million

678
00:58:06,639 --> 00:58:07,560
Superintendent Wong?

679
00:58:18,009 --> 00:58:19,290
Turn around to the main entrance

680
00:59:10,538 --> 00:59:11,819
What do you think of me?

681
00:59:18,466 --> 00:59:20,868
Your birthday is on the 25th, right?

682
00:59:40,646 --> 00:59:41,567
Let's go

683
00:59:41,767 --> 00:59:42,808
Police. Let's go

684
01:00:12,916 --> 01:00:14,238
Bad news, Boss

685
01:00:14,478 --> 01:00:15,439
Something happened to SP Wong

686
01:01:05,485 --> 01:01:08,048
There's a gunfight in Sheung Wan
this afternoon

687
01:01:08,288 --> 01:01:09,329
Three suspects were dead;

688
01:01:09,569 --> 01:01:11,971
several suspects and pedestrians
were injured

689
01:01:12,212 --> 01:01:16,255
The police confirmed that
one of the victims

690
01:01:16,456 --> 01:01:17,497
was superintendent in OCTB
Mr. Wong Chi-shing

691
01:01:17,737 --> 01:01:18,818
The motive is unknown

692
01:01:19,058 --> 01:01:22,381
Possibility of gang feud is not ruled out

693
01:01:22,661 --> 01:01:24,343
They are now after several triad members
active in the Southern Kowloon area

694
01:01:24,583 --> 01:01:25,985
The Police Commissioner

695
01:01:26,185 --> 01:01:28,707
expressed condolence

696
01:01:28,947 --> 01:01:30,629
and pledged to solve the case
as soon as possible

697
01:01:31,870 --> 01:01:33,351
It was a close shave

698
01:01:33,872 --> 01:01:35,433
10 minutes after you went to your massage

699
01:01:35,674 --> 01:01:37,355
Boss told us to get ready

700
01:01:38,596 --> 01:01:40,078
I was scared stiff

701
01:01:40,558 --> 01:01:43,441
You know
I hide under the car in every fight

702
01:01:45,403 --> 01:01:47,124
And there were guns up there

703
01:01:47,805 --> 01:01:50,888
I wanted to sneak out of there

704
01:01:54,691 --> 01:01:58,855
Two days ago
Boss told me to go to his room

705
01:01:59,256 --> 01:02:01,418
He asked me how long I'd worked for him

706
01:02:01,738 --> 01:02:02,899
How the hell could I remember?

707
01:02:04,460 --> 01:02:05,942
He then said: Keung

708
01:02:07,063 --> 01:02:08,584
it's been 5 years already

709
01:02:10,346 --> 01:02:12,748
You've performed well all these years

710
01:02:13,749 --> 01:02:15,511
I have a question for you

711
01:02:16,792 --> 01:02:19,354
If one of your brothers is a mole

712
01:02:19,675 --> 01:02:20,916
will you dare to take him out?

713
01:02:21,756 --> 01:02:24,079
Of course I said yes to his face

714
01:02:24,359 --> 01:02:25,880
You think I'm an idiot?

715
01:02:29,444 --> 01:02:30,805
What's the result?

716
01:02:31,245 --> 01:02:33,487
Of course they couldn't find the mole

717
01:02:35,449 --> 01:02:37,091
The cop was tough

718
01:02:37,771 --> 01:02:38,892
They dragged him upstairs

719
01:02:39,253 --> 01:02:41,655
and beat him up for a good 10 minutes

720
01:02:42,736 --> 01:02:44,017
10 minutes...

721
01:02:47,981 --> 01:02:49,262
10 minutes...

722
01:02:50,904 --> 01:02:52,465
He didn't say a word

723
01:02:58,831 --> 01:02:59,712
Keung

724
01:03:02,194 --> 01:03:03,315
Boss said...

725
01:03:04,677 --> 01:03:06,518
the cop was hot on his trail

726
01:03:10,042 --> 01:03:12,964
Who didn't show up today is the mole

727
01:03:13,965 --> 01:03:15,046
I didn't...

728
01:03:15,647 --> 01:03:17,288
tell him you went for a massage

729
01:03:18,850 --> 01:03:22,053
If Boss knew, you're dead meat

730
01:03:24,775 --> 01:03:27,818
Yan, I want to ask you something

731
01:03:28,098 --> 01:03:30,180
How was the masseuse today?

732
01:03:32,262 --> 01:03:33,463
Because...

733
01:03:34,785 --> 01:03:37,267
if she's ugly, it's not worth it

734
01:03:42,912 --> 01:03:44,113
Leave right away

735
01:03:45,074 --> 01:03:47,436
There will be lots of cops after a car crash

736
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,522
Anyway, remember this:

737
01:03:55,604 --> 01:03:57,526
if you see someone

738
01:03:58,767 --> 01:04:03,732
doing something
but at the same time watching you...

739
01:04:06,814 --> 01:04:08,536
then he is a cop

740
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:53,160
According to the closed-circuit TV

741
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:55,520
SP Wong entered that building at 4:15 pm

742
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:58,321
The suspects entered 20 minutes later

743
01:04:59,641 --> 01:05:01,360
At 4:38 pm

744
01:05:01,721 --> 01:05:03,441
we received lnspector Lau's report

745
01:05:05,041 --> 01:05:08,561
8 minutes before we arrived
someone fell off the building

746
01:05:10,002 --> 01:05:11,202
That was SP Wong

747
01:05:12,121 --> 01:05:15,443
All the suspects killed or
injured belong to Sam's gang

748
01:05:16,242 --> 01:05:17,683
Many suspects escaped

749
01:05:18,522 --> 01:05:19,643
The actual numbers are unknown

750
01:05:20,283 --> 01:05:22,203
Do you know why SP Wong went to
that building?

751
01:05:26,564 --> 01:05:27,724
It was me

752
01:05:28,163 --> 01:05:29,564
I told CIB to follow him

753
01:05:29,844 --> 01:05:31,485
Why was CIB following him?

754
01:05:32,004 --> 01:05:33,404
That's IA's business

755
01:05:34,244 --> 01:05:35,564
Now that SP Wong is dead

756
01:05:35,805 --> 01:05:37,085
it is OCTB's business

757
01:05:37,405 --> 01:05:38,565
What kind of attitude is that?

758
01:05:38,805 --> 01:05:40,925
SP Wong was dedicated to the police force
and you investigated him?

759
01:05:41,206 --> 01:05:42,805
What kind of attitude is that?

760
01:05:43,005 --> 01:05:45,606
So we senior officers have to ask
for your approval, huh?

761
01:05:45,886 --> 01:05:47,286
Your people have made a mistake now
Or SP Wong wouldn't have died

762
01:05:47,527 --> 01:05:48,446
I am talking business here

763
01:05:48,727 --> 01:05:49,727
I am talking personal matters

764
01:05:49,927 --> 01:05:51,606
Nobody wanted this, OK?

765
01:05:57,527 --> 01:05:58,488
Sorry, sir

766
01:06:00,928 --> 01:06:02,168
It's my negligence

767
01:06:04,608 --> 01:06:06,288
I will give everybody an answer

768
01:06:07,009 --> 01:06:07,848
Sorry

769
01:06:12,609 --> 01:06:14,129
SP Wong has a file

770
01:06:14,370 --> 01:06:16,289
with information on our undercover
in Sam's gang

771
01:06:16,890 --> 01:06:18,569
It is locked by a password

772
01:06:19,010 --> 01:06:20,770
The technical staff can't decipher it

773
01:06:21,690 --> 01:06:22,170
Inspector Lau

774
01:06:22,370 --> 01:06:22,971
Yes

775
01:06:23,250 --> 01:06:25,251
Work with CIB

776
01:06:25,491 --> 01:06:26,371
to unlock it

777
01:06:26,691 --> 01:06:28,491
Find our man and get him out of there

778
01:06:30,491 --> 01:06:31,451
By the way

779
01:06:32,931 --> 01:06:34,411
SP Wong was a good cop

780
01:06:35,491 --> 01:06:38,812
We should give him a grand funeral

781
01:06:39,492 --> 01:06:40,133
Okay?

782
01:06:40,772 --> 01:06:41,732
Yes, sir

783
01:06:53,094 --> 01:06:53,853
Hello?

784
01:06:54,454 --> 01:06:57,734
Boss. Why made such a scene?

785
01:06:58,535 --> 01:06:59,615
He was following me all the time

786
01:06:59,855 --> 01:07:01,214
One of us would have to die

787
01:07:01,414 --> 01:07:02,775
I'm now in charge of everything here

788
01:07:03,015 --> 01:07:04,495
If you're having any transactions
just let me know

789
01:07:04,776 --> 01:07:05,695
It's done

790
01:07:06,055 --> 01:07:08,615
We got the goods when they killed
the cop today

791
01:07:09,296 --> 01:07:12,896
I won't bother you now

792
01:09:14,950 --> 01:09:16,110
What did you call me for?

793
01:09:18,791 --> 01:09:19,991
So you're the one?

794
01:09:22,311 --> 01:09:23,232
Who are you?

795
01:09:23,471 --> 01:09:24,911
Inspector Lau of OCTB

796
01:09:30,513 --> 01:09:32,673
SP Wong is gone. We're all upset

797
01:09:33,552 --> 01:09:34,993
I still have unfinished business

798
01:09:36,033 --> 01:09:39,154
SP Wong wouldn't want you to
take law in your own hands

799
01:09:39,473 --> 01:09:40,593
What do you want?

800
01:09:42,193 --> 01:09:43,153
Co-operation

801
01:09:52,435 --> 01:09:54,995
The police has discovered

802
01:09:55,235 --> 01:09:56,835
the body of a fugitive suspect
He was involved in

803
01:09:57,115 --> 01:09:59,956
the Sheung Wan shooting earlier today

804
01:10:00,195 --> 01:10:01,156
The police has confirmed

805
01:10:01,395 --> 01:10:04,436
the body to be an undercover cop
Tsui Wai-keung

806
01:10:04,676 --> 01:10:06,556
The police has expressed their condolence

807
01:10:06,836 --> 01:10:07,676
and promised a thorough investigation

808
01:10:07,836 --> 01:10:08,956
Boss, Yan is back

809
01:10:09,637 --> 01:10:12,357
Three vehicles collided in Yuen Long
today

810
01:10:12,637 --> 01:10:13,997
The driver of the private car was trapped

811
01:10:14,237 --> 01:10:15,758
until firefighters came and rescued him

812
01:10:18,798 --> 01:10:19,678
Boss

813
01:10:20,638 --> 01:10:21,518
What is it, Yan?

814
01:10:22,838 --> 01:10:24,239
I have taken care of Keung already

815
01:10:26,078 --> 01:10:27,519
Did you ever send him to the warehouse?

816
01:10:29,039 --> 01:10:30,640
It will be disastrous if he knows where it is

817
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:41,681
Boss. It's me

818
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,000
You don't have to go yourself

819
01:10:43,240 --> 01:10:44,280
I don't want anyone to know the password

820
01:10:44,641 --> 01:10:45,521
I understand

821
01:10:46,001 --> 01:10:47,121
I'll send everyone away

822
01:10:55,802 --> 01:10:56,602
Inspector Cheung

823
01:10:58,843 --> 01:11:00,402
Tell those boys to stop following
Sam's gang

824
01:11:05,203 --> 01:11:07,723
I got information that Sam is heading
towards the warehouse

825
01:11:07,883 --> 01:11:10,043
He won't go if he's being tailed

826
01:11:12,444 --> 01:11:13,324
Just call them back

827
01:11:13,605 --> 01:11:15,004
Let's do something for SP Wong

828
01:11:15,204 --> 01:11:16,484
Please help me, OK?

829
01:11:17,285 --> 01:11:19,165
Say something

830
01:11:20,045 --> 01:11:21,725
This is not my case

831
01:11:22,245 --> 01:11:24,166
Officer Chan told me not to get involved

832
01:11:25,286 --> 01:11:28,606
If they're willing to stop
then it's up to them

833
01:11:29,126 --> 01:11:31,807
I know I'm responsible for
SP Wong's death

834
01:11:32,086 --> 01:11:32,847
I am also a cop, like you

835
01:11:33,127 --> 01:11:35,047
I want to solve the case too

836
01:11:35,687 --> 01:11:37,207
I thought you only want promotion

837
01:11:39,807 --> 01:11:41,448
It's SP Wong's mole who tipped me off

838
01:11:41,688 --> 01:11:42,408
Do you believe it or not?

839
01:11:42,688 --> 01:11:44,568
This is our last chance
Are you ready to take the risk?

840
01:12:31,453 --> 01:12:33,214
Attention: Target vehicle

841
01:12:33,453 --> 01:12:35,334
on Highway no.3

842
01:12:42,775 --> 01:12:43,895
U-turn at Pier 3

843
01:12:44,175 --> 01:12:45,455
to Lung Cheung Road

844
01:12:58,096 --> 01:12:59,017
They have been here for 20 minutes

845
01:12:59,296 --> 01:13:00,857
they are going to the 4th floor of
the car park

846
01:13:19,939 --> 01:13:22,739
Officer Chan won't let me touch this case

847
01:13:23,060 --> 01:13:25,179
If anything goes wrong
you'll take the blame

848
01:13:30,581 --> 01:13:32,061
They are loading the goods at 4P

849
01:13:32,300 --> 01:13:34,141
Elephant, stand by at the exit at 3P

850
01:13:34,341 --> 01:13:35,981
Double Eight, watch the entrance at 2P

851
01:13:36,221 --> 01:13:38,381
Fishball and Cheung, stand by here

852
01:13:38,581 --> 01:13:40,061
All of you, wait for my signal

853
01:13:58,424 --> 01:14:00,184
Oh, I forgot Boss told me to stay behind

854
01:14:00,463 --> 01:14:01,424
Drop me off here

855
01:14:45,749 --> 01:14:46,389
Run him over

856
01:15:35,915 --> 01:15:37,116
My Master always said that about my life:

857
01:15:38,035 --> 01:15:41,396
What thousands must die so that
Caesar may become great

858
01:15:42,436 --> 01:15:45,476
You choose your own future

859
01:15:59,558 --> 01:16:00,358
That's what you have chosen

860
01:16:36,402 --> 01:16:38,283
Coffee for you

861
01:16:45,684 --> 01:16:46,603
He's waited a long time for you

862
01:16:56,284 --> 01:16:57,404
So it's you?

863
01:17:02,685 --> 01:17:03,605
Was the stereo OK?

864
01:17:03,886 --> 01:17:04,845
Pretty good

865
01:17:05,725 --> 01:17:06,965
Those tube amps have to be warmed up

866
01:17:07,286 --> 01:17:09,326
Wait 10 minutes and it sounds great

867
01:17:10,166 --> 01:17:11,126
Should I salute you?

868
01:17:11,326 --> 01:17:12,326
Not, don't

869
01:17:14,166 --> 01:17:15,286
How long have you been an undercover?

870
01:17:16,087 --> 01:17:17,687
I've followed Sam for 3 years

871
01:17:18,047 --> 01:17:19,447
I had several other bosses before

872
01:17:20,008 --> 01:17:21,368
All together it's been 10 years

873
01:17:21,607 --> 01:17:22,647
10 years?

874
01:17:22,967 --> 01:17:24,248
I should salute you instead

875
01:17:24,448 --> 01:17:25,728
I just want an identity

876
01:17:26,048 --> 01:17:27,288
I want to be a normal man

877
01:17:28,609 --> 01:17:29,448
Getting tired?

878
01:17:31,248 --> 01:17:33,929
You've never been a mole
you won't understand

879
01:17:37,290 --> 01:17:38,849
Too bad I still can't find the stooge

880
01:17:39,169 --> 01:17:40,450
I'll take him down if I find him

881
01:17:46,851 --> 01:17:50,011
Don't worry
Let me give you back your identity

882
01:17:50,371 --> 01:17:51,931
I'll open your file but...

883
01:17:52,291 --> 01:17:53,331
I don't have the password

884
01:17:55,332 --> 01:17:56,852
What's the Morse code for
"undercover"?

885
01:17:58,812 --> 01:18:00,012
That's it?

886
01:18:44,777 --> 01:18:45,417
Are you serious?

887
01:18:45,657 --> 01:18:47,098
You don't even know to
spell BODYGUARD?

888
01:18:47,577 --> 01:18:47,978
Isn't it supposed to look like this?

889
01:18:48,258 --> 01:18:49,458
Of course not

890
01:20:57,312 --> 01:20:58,193
Dr. Lee

891
01:20:59,553 --> 01:21:00,673
I thought you wouldn't come

892
01:21:00,993 --> 01:21:02,353
You're wanted by the police

893
01:21:04,194 --> 01:21:05,594
Can I sleep in your chair again?

894
01:21:06,354 --> 01:21:07,634
Let's talk upstairs

895
01:21:11,475 --> 01:21:13,114
Last time you said you're a cop

896
01:21:13,915 --> 01:21:14,995
Is it true?

897
01:21:15,634 --> 01:21:16,555
It was true

898
01:21:17,595 --> 01:21:18,795
But I'm not so sure now

899
01:21:23,916 --> 01:21:25,396
So what's your plan?

900
01:21:26,196 --> 01:21:28,757
I don't know. Still thinking

901
01:21:42,477 --> 01:21:44,318
There's one thing I've been trying to
tell you for a while

902
01:21:45,759 --> 01:21:47,319
But it's too embarrassing

903
01:21:53,719 --> 01:21:55,560
I told you I dreamt about you all the time

904
01:21:56,439 --> 01:21:57,479
It's true

905
01:22:05,521 --> 01:22:06,681
Me too

906
01:22:48,885 --> 01:22:52,287
Remember my secret. Goodbye

907
01:23:08,368 --> 01:23:09,288
Mary

908
01:23:10,328 --> 01:23:12,729
What is it? Has it broken down?

909
01:23:23,330 --> 01:23:25,370
This morning
the guys from the stereo shop came

910
01:23:26,410 --> 01:23:28,170
They have tuned it up already

911
01:23:29,931 --> 01:23:32,131
They also left a CD sampler for you

912
01:23:33,291 --> 01:23:34,531
I've listened to it

913
01:23:40,692 --> 01:23:42,212
Have you had breakfast yet?

914
01:23:42,652 --> 01:23:43,733
I'll get you some

915
01:23:45,013 --> 01:23:46,133
Iced tea?

916
01:23:47,213 --> 01:23:48,333
Chinese buns?

917
01:23:49,573 --> 01:23:50,573
Sure

918
01:24:05,775 --> 01:24:08,415
I can't finish my novel

919
01:24:12,295 --> 01:24:14,376
I don't know whether he's good or bad

920
01:24:17,576 --> 01:24:19,896
I think only he knows

921
01:24:21,697 --> 01:24:23,017
A shipment will come in next week

922
01:24:24,336 --> 01:24:25,577
They are watching closely

923
01:24:26,457 --> 01:24:27,938
You do what you need to do

924
01:24:28,738 --> 01:24:30,258
I will handle the rest

925
01:24:31,817 --> 01:24:34,418
The file is open. I can't handle it

926
01:24:34,738 --> 01:24:36,259
So you're not worried about me

927
01:24:37,739 --> 01:24:39,539
You are worried about yourself
lnspector Lau

928
01:24:44,059 --> 01:24:45,259
Are the voices crisp enough?

929
01:24:45,539 --> 01:24:46,539
The precious recording

930
01:24:47,380 --> 01:24:49,260
was taken from Sam's office

931
01:24:50,260 --> 01:24:51,300
It's not your lucky day

932
01:24:52,220 --> 01:24:54,380
Don't threaten me. What do you want?

933
01:24:54,861 --> 01:24:56,061
I want my identity back

934
01:24:56,981 --> 01:24:59,461
3 pm, Central Ferry Pier
Keep your cell on

935
01:25:22,304 --> 01:25:24,744
The number you have dialed cannot be
connected

936
01:25:24,984 --> 01:25:26,944
Please leave a message after the beep

937
01:25:28,144 --> 01:25:29,985
Mary, I'm sorry

938
01:25:31,145 --> 01:25:32,585
I've chosen to be the good guy

939
01:25:33,305 --> 01:25:34,865
I'm going to meet Yan now

940
01:25:35,465 --> 01:25:38,185
No matter what
I'll give him back his identity

941
01:25:38,626 --> 01:25:40,305
The file is in my computer

942
01:25:40,866 --> 01:25:42,466
The password is your birthday

943
01:26:56,354 --> 01:26:57,514
You sure know what you're doing

944
01:26:57,835 --> 01:26:59,235
I also went to the cadet school

945
01:27:02,755 --> 01:27:05,636
Do all undercover cops like rooftops?

946
01:27:07,596 --> 01:27:10,396
Unlike you, I'm not afraid of light

947
01:27:12,197 --> 01:27:13,397
So where's the stuff I want?

948
01:27:14,877 --> 01:27:17,038
I don't think you've brought
what I want either

949
01:27:21,958 --> 01:27:22,998
So what does this mean?

950
01:27:24,038 --> 01:27:25,599
We came up here to sunbathe?

951
01:27:27,558 --> 01:27:28,959
Give me a chance

952
01:27:30,239 --> 01:27:31,559
How?

953
01:27:33,599 --> 01:27:34,919
I have no choice before

954
01:27:36,119 --> 01:27:37,999
but now I want to turn over a new leaf

955
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:43,000
Good

956
01:27:45,161 --> 01:27:46,241
Try telling that to the judge

957
01:27:47,681 --> 01:27:49,080
See what he has to say

958
01:27:52,321 --> 01:27:53,762
You want me dead?

959
01:27:54,161 --> 01:27:56,762
Sorry, I'm a cop

960
01:27:56,922 --> 01:27:57,842
Who knows that?

961
01:28:14,124 --> 01:28:15,204
Don't move. Police

962
01:28:16,364 --> 01:28:18,245
Drop your weapon and let lnspector Lau
go first

963
01:28:18,724 --> 01:28:20,285
Your boss is Sam's mole

964
01:28:20,525 --> 01:28:21,645
I got evidence

965
01:28:21,925 --> 01:28:23,364
Let's clear this up at the station

966
01:28:23,845 --> 01:28:25,765
Drop your weapon now

967
01:28:26,045 --> 01:28:27,085
I've called the police

968
01:28:27,325 --> 01:28:28,245
Why should I trust you?

969
01:28:28,525 --> 01:28:29,645
You don't have to

970
01:28:52,409 --> 01:28:53,609
You'd better watch out

971
01:28:55,049 --> 01:28:56,329
Look who's talking

972
01:29:39,413 --> 01:29:42,694
I wish you every success in
the police force

973
01:29:45,055 --> 01:29:46,335
Bottoms up, officers

974
01:29:49,295 --> 01:29:52,015
No sweat. We are brothers

975
01:29:53,215 --> 01:29:54,576
Sam is dead now

976
01:29:57,056 --> 01:29:58,216
You have to look after me

977
01:30:05,056 --> 01:30:06,377
I joined the cadet school in 1994

978
01:30:06,897 --> 01:30:09,738
But my career never really takes off

979
01:30:11,098 --> 01:30:12,697
Sam looked down on me

980
01:30:13,458 --> 01:30:15,178
I've taken care of Sam's tape

981
01:30:15,778 --> 01:30:17,978
Don't worry. I'll follow you from now on

982
01:30:20,018 --> 01:30:22,979
Our folks will be here any minute
Let's give them a good show

983
01:30:28,739 --> 01:30:32,060
I'm actually quite smart
Too bad Sam never knew that

984
01:31:11,264 --> 01:31:12,544
I'm a cop

985
01:31:36,748 --> 01:31:39,028
Six months later, Dr. Lee Sum Yee
was looking through the personal

986
01:31:39,228 --> 01:31:40,828
properties left by Officer Yip
Headmaster of the Cadet

987
01:31:40,868 --> 01:31:43,228
She found Chen Wing-yan's file that
proved his police identity

988
01:31:43,308 --> 01:31:45,149
Chen Wing-yan is now buried
next to SP Wong Chi-shing

989
01:32:28,954 --> 01:32:30,834
How are you, Mr. Policeman?

990
01:33:08,679 --> 01:33:11,478
Those who break the rules will be like him

991
01:33:11,879 --> 01:33:12,999
They will be expelled

992
01:33:14,039 --> 01:33:15,919
Anybody wants to trade place with him?

993
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:24,360
I do

994
01:33:32,840 --> 01:33:38,920
