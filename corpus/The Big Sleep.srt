1
00:01:13,456 --> 00:01:15,958
My name's Marlowe.
The general wanted to see me.

2
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:19,517
Yes, Mr. Marlowe.
Will you come in, please, sir?

3
00:01:21,731 --> 00:01:25,447
- I'll tell the general that you're here.
- Thank you.

4
00:01:38,381 --> 00:01:39,832
Morning.

5
00:01:45,155 --> 00:01:46,986
You're not very tall, are you?

6
00:01:48,291 --> 00:01:49,978
Well, I tried to be.

7
00:01:52,428 --> 00:01:54,455
Not bad-looking...

8
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:56,698
...though you probably know it.

9
00:01:56,699 --> 00:01:58,111
Thank you.

10
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:01,790
- What's your name?
- Reilly. Doghouse Reilly.

11
00:02:02,772 --> 00:02:05,340
That's a funny kind of name.

12
00:02:05,341 --> 00:02:06,675
You think so?

13
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:10,579
What are you? A prizefighter?

14
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:12,247
- No, I'm a shamus.
- What's that?

15
00:02:12,248 --> 00:02:16,734
- A private detective.
- You're making fun of me.

16
00:02:24,828 --> 00:02:26,777
You're cute.

17
00:02:29,666 --> 00:02:32,610
The general will see you now, sir.

18
00:02:39,843 --> 00:02:41,977
- Who's that?
- Miss Carmen Sternwood.

19
00:02:41,978 --> 00:02:44,346
You ought to wean her.
She's old enough.

20
00:02:55,358 --> 00:02:58,227
- This is Mr. Marlowe, general.
- How do you do, sir?

21
00:02:58,228 --> 00:03:00,229
- Sit down, sir.
- Thank you.

22
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:02,022
Brandy, Norris.

23
00:03:02,632 --> 00:03:06,168
- How do you like your brandy, sir?
- In a glass.

24
00:03:06,169 --> 00:03:08,570
I used to like mine with champagne.

25
00:03:08,571 --> 00:03:10,739
Champagne cold as Valley Forge...

26
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:13,375
...with about three ponies
of brandy under it.

27
00:03:13,376 --> 00:03:15,207
Come, come, man!
Pour a decent one.

28
00:03:16,045 --> 00:03:19,181
I like to see people drink.

29
00:03:19,182 --> 00:03:20,974
That'll do, Norris.

30
00:03:21,384 --> 00:03:23,619
You may take off your coat, sir.

31
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,254
Thank you.

32
00:03:25,255 --> 00:03:28,395
Too hot in here for any man
with any blood in his veins.

33
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,960
You may smoke too.

34
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:34,224
I can still enjoy the smell of it.

35
00:03:35,365 --> 00:03:40,102
Nice state of affairs when a man
has to indulge his vices by proxy.

36
00:03:40,103 --> 00:03:44,439
You're looking, sir, at a very dull
survival of a very gaudy life.

37
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,075
Crippled, paralyzed in both legs.

38
00:03:47,076 --> 00:03:49,878
Little I can eat, and
my sleep is so near waking...

39
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:51,546
...it's hardly worth the name.

40
00:03:51,547 --> 00:03:56,336
I seem to exist largely on heat,
like a newborn spider.

41
00:03:56,586 --> 00:03:59,888
The orchids are an excuse
for the heat.

42
00:03:59,889 --> 00:04:02,424
- Do you like orchids?
- Not particularly.

43
00:04:02,425 --> 00:04:03,575
Nasty things.

44
00:04:03,927 --> 00:04:06,261
Their flesh is too much
like the flesh of men.

45
00:04:06,262 --> 00:04:09,742
Their perfume has the rotten
sweetness of corruption.

46
00:04:13,469 --> 00:04:15,000
Tell me about yourself.

47
00:04:15,571 --> 00:04:18,440
There isn't much to tell.
I'm 38. I went to college.

48
00:04:18,441 --> 00:04:21,143
I can still speak English
when my business demands it.

49
00:04:21,144 --> 00:04:23,345
I worked for the
district attorney's office.

50
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:26,290
Inspector Bernie Ohls
said you wanted to see me.

51
00:04:26,716 --> 00:04:29,201
You didn't like working
for the district attorney?

52
00:04:30,553 --> 00:04:34,923
I was fired for insubordination.
I seem to rate pretty high on that.

53
00:04:36,092 --> 00:04:38,657
I always did, myself.

54
00:04:39,228 --> 00:04:41,138
What do you know about my family?

55
00:04:41,397 --> 00:04:44,066
Well, you're a widower,
a millionaire.

56
00:04:44,067 --> 00:04:46,134
You have two daughters.
One unmarried...

57
00:04:46,135 --> 00:04:49,615
...and one married to a man
named Rutledge, but it didn't take.

58
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:52,204
- Both living with you and both...
- Go on, sir.

59
00:04:52,442 --> 00:04:55,503
Both pretty and both pretty wild.

60
00:04:56,946 --> 00:05:00,125
- Why'd you want to see me?
- I'm being blackmailed again.

61
00:05:00,249 --> 00:05:01,383
Again?

62
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:04,720
About a year ago, I paid a man
named Joe Brody $5000...

63
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:07,089
...to let my younger daughter alone.

64
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:09,500
What does that mean?

65
00:05:10,126 --> 00:05:12,389
It means, "Hm!"

66
00:05:12,795 --> 00:05:15,438
It didn't go through the DA
or I'd have heard.

67
00:05:15,598 --> 00:05:18,280
- Who handled it for you?
- Shawn Regan.

68
00:05:18,301 --> 00:05:22,204
There must be some reason why
he isn't handling it this time.

69
00:05:22,205 --> 00:05:24,039
Shawn has left me.

70
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:27,951
- I thought I hadn't seen him lately.
- A month ago, without a word.

71
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:32,381
I had no claim on him.
I was only his employer.

72
00:05:32,382 --> 00:05:35,784
But I had hoped that he'd come
to regard me as something more.

73
00:05:35,785 --> 00:05:38,925
And that at least
he'd have said goodbye.

74
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:42,032
That's what hurt.

75
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:44,793
You knew him too?

76
00:05:44,794 --> 00:05:48,030
Yes, in the old days when he
used to run rum out of Mexico...

77
00:05:48,031 --> 00:05:50,265
...and I was on the other side.

78
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:52,134
We swapped shots
between drinks...

79
00:05:52,135 --> 00:05:54,241
...or drinks between shots.

80
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:57,639
My respects to you, sir.

81
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:01,656
Few men ever swapped more than
one shot with Shawn Regan.

82
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:04,980
He commanded a brigade
in the Irish Republican Army.

83
00:06:04,981 --> 00:06:06,081
But you knew that.

84
00:06:06,082 --> 00:06:08,149
No, I didn't.

85
00:06:10,253 --> 00:06:12,687
I know he was a good man
at whatever he did.

86
00:06:12,688 --> 00:06:16,992
No one was more pleased than I
when you took him on as your...

87
00:06:16,993 --> 00:06:18,444
...whatever he was.

88
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:20,295
My friend.

89
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:22,363
My son, almost.

90
00:06:24,033 --> 00:06:26,635
Many an hour he sat with me,
sweating like a pig...

91
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:31,373
...drinking brandy and telling
stories of the Irish Revolution.

92
00:06:31,374 --> 00:06:33,175
Well, enough of that.

93
00:06:33,176 --> 00:06:34,549
Here.

94
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:46,443
Read the other side.

95
00:07:04,307 --> 00:07:06,334
These her signatures?

96
00:07:06,709 --> 00:07:09,211
- Who's Arthur Geiger?
- I haven't any idea.

97
00:07:09,212 --> 00:07:11,546
- Did you ask her?
- No, and I don't intend to.

98
00:07:11,547 --> 00:07:14,346
If I did, she'd just suck
her thumb and look coy.

99
00:07:14,484 --> 00:07:17,452
I met her in the hall
and she did that to me.

100
00:07:17,453 --> 00:07:20,655
Then she tried to sit on my lap
while I was standing up.

101
00:07:20,656 --> 00:07:21,990
Well?

102
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:27,195
Your other daughter, Mrs. Rutledge.
She mixed up in this?

103
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:28,608
They alike?

104
00:07:28,798 --> 00:07:32,601
They're alike only in having
the same corrupt blood.

105
00:07:32,602 --> 00:07:35,370
Vivian is spoiled, exacting...

106
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:37,272
...smart and ruthless.

107
00:07:37,273 --> 00:07:42,140
Carmen is still a little child who
likes to pull the wings off flies.

108
00:07:42,678 --> 00:07:45,447
I assume they have
all the usual vices...

109
00:07:45,448 --> 00:07:48,509
...besides those they've
invented for themselves.

110
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:51,520
If I seem a bit sinister
as a parent, Mr. Marlowe...

111
00:07:51,521 --> 00:07:54,222
...it's because my hold
on life is too slight...

112
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:56,458
...to include any
Victorian hypocrisy.

113
00:07:56,459 --> 00:07:59,628
I need hardly add that any man
who has lived as I have...

114
00:07:59,629 --> 00:08:03,398
...and who indulges, for the first
time, in parenthood at my age...

115
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:05,008
...deserves all he gets.

116
00:08:06,135 --> 00:08:07,666
Well?

117
00:08:13,943 --> 00:08:15,435
Pay him.

118
00:08:15,711 --> 00:08:19,125
- Why?
- She signed these notes, didn't she?

119
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:26,855
Who's this Joe Brody
you paid the $5000 to?

120
00:08:26,856 --> 00:08:29,925
I can't recall.
My butler, Norris, would know.

121
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:33,228
I think he called himself a gambler.

122
00:08:33,229 --> 00:08:35,530
Geiger says these are gambling debts.

123
00:08:35,531 --> 00:08:36,943
They may be.

124
00:08:36,966 --> 00:08:38,719
Think they are?

125
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:44,372
You want me to take this Geiger
off your back, right?

126
00:08:44,373 --> 00:08:46,174
Want to know anything?

127
00:08:46,175 --> 00:08:47,943
I just want to get rid of him.

128
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:50,011
Might cost you a little.

129
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,154
Thanks for the drink.

130
00:08:53,182 --> 00:08:55,951
I enjoyed your drink
as much as you did, sir.

131
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:58,281
- You'll hear from me.
- Good luck.

132
00:09:10,433 --> 00:09:14,803
Mr. Marlowe, Mrs. Rutledge would like
to see you before you leave.

133
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:17,372
About the money, the general
has instructed me...

134
00:09:17,373 --> 00:09:20,008
...to give you a check
for whatever you require.

135
00:09:20,009 --> 00:09:21,743
Instructed you how?

136
00:09:21,744 --> 00:09:25,046
I see, sir. I forget
that you're a detective.

137
00:09:25,047 --> 00:09:27,515
By the way he rang his bell, sir.

138
00:09:27,516 --> 00:09:29,784
- You write his checks?
- I have that privilege.

139
00:09:29,785 --> 00:09:32,287
Good for you.
I don't need any money now...

140
00:09:32,288 --> 00:09:35,428
...but when I do, I get
$ 25 a day and expenses.

141
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:38,660
- How did she know I was here?
- She saw you through the window.

142
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:41,496
I was obliged to tell her
who you were.

143
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:42,989
I don't know as I like that.

144
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:45,734
Are you attempting
to tell me my duties, sir?

145
00:09:45,735 --> 00:09:48,169
Just having fun trying
to guess what they are.

146
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,923
This way, sir.

147
00:09:52,742 --> 00:09:55,541
- Go right in. You're expected.
- Thanks.

148
00:10:00,216 --> 00:10:02,401
You wanted to see me?

149
00:10:07,657 --> 00:10:09,724
So you're a private detective?

150
00:10:09,725 --> 00:10:12,060
I didn't know they existed,
except in books.

151
00:10:12,061 --> 00:10:15,463
Or else they were greasy men
snooping around hotel corridors.

152
00:10:15,464 --> 00:10:17,073
You're a mess, aren't you?

153
00:10:18,668 --> 00:10:20,568
I'm not very tall either.

154
00:10:20,569 --> 00:10:24,339
Next time I'll come on stilts, wear
a white tie and carry a tennis racket.

155
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:27,008
I doubt if even that would help.

156
00:10:27,009 --> 00:10:30,412
Now, this business of Dad's,
think you can handle it for him?

157
00:10:30,413 --> 00:10:31,864
It shouldn't be too tough.

158
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:34,316
I'd have thought
it took a little effort.

159
00:10:34,317 --> 00:10:35,690
Not too much.

160
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:38,119
What will your first step be?

161
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,455
- The usual one.
- There's a usual one?

162
00:10:40,456 --> 00:10:42,657
Sure there is.
It comes with diagrams...

163
00:10:42,658 --> 00:10:46,394
<i>...on page 47 of How to be a
Detective in Ten Easy Lessons...</i>

164
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:48,880
...and your father
offered me a drink.

165
00:10:48,964 --> 00:10:50,932
You must've read one
on comedy.

166
00:10:50,933 --> 00:10:54,069
- Hear what I said about the drink?
- I'm serious. Father's...

167
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,869
- I said your father...
- Help yourself!

168
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:02,410
Now, look, Mr. Marlowe,
my father's not well.

169
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:05,313
I want this case handled with
the least worry to him.

170
00:11:05,314 --> 00:11:07,649
That's the way
I was going to handle it.

171
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:10,585
I see. No professional secrets?

172
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:13,054
- I thought you wanted a drink.
- I changed my mind.

173
00:11:13,055 --> 00:11:14,664
Then, what...

174
00:11:19,028 --> 00:11:21,513
- How'd you like Dad?
- I liked him.

175
00:11:21,697 --> 00:11:24,299
He liked Shawn. Shawn Regan.

176
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:27,138
I suppose you know who he is.

177
00:11:27,536 --> 00:11:29,865
You don't have to play poker with me.

178
00:11:29,905 --> 00:11:32,090
- Doesn't Dad want to find him?
- Do you?

179
00:11:32,308 --> 00:11:35,276
Of course. It wasn't right
for him to go off like that.

180
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:37,762
Broke Dad's heart,
although he won't say much.

181
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:40,382
- Or did he?
- Why don't you ask him?

182
00:11:40,383 --> 00:11:43,184
I don't see what there is
to be cagey about.

183
00:11:43,185 --> 00:11:44,597
I don't like your manners!

184
00:11:44,653 --> 00:11:47,522
I'm not crazy about yours.
I didn't ask to see you.

185
00:11:47,523 --> 00:11:50,325
I don't mind if you don't
like my manners. I don't either.

186
00:11:50,326 --> 00:11:51,993
I grieve over them evenings.

187
00:11:51,994 --> 00:11:54,729
I don't mind your drinking
your lunch out of a bottle.

188
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:57,165
But don't waste your time
cross-examining me.

189
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:59,770
People don't talk to me like that!

190
00:12:02,905 --> 00:12:06,408
Do you always think
you can handle people...

191
00:12:06,409 --> 00:12:08,476
...like trained seals?

192
00:12:08,611 --> 00:12:10,378
I usually get away with it too.

193
00:12:10,379 --> 00:12:12,580
How nice for you.

194
00:12:12,581 --> 00:12:15,146
Just what is it you're afraid of?

195
00:12:17,052 --> 00:12:19,220
Dad didn't see you
about Shawn, did he?

196
00:12:19,221 --> 00:12:20,516
Didn't he?

197
00:12:20,556 --> 00:12:22,657
Could you find him
if Dad wanted you to?

198
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:24,345
Maybe. When did he go?

199
00:12:24,693 --> 00:12:25,827
About a month back.

200
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:28,396
Drove off one afternoon
without saying a word.

201
00:12:28,397 --> 00:12:31,266
They found his car parked
in some private garage.

202
00:12:31,267 --> 00:12:33,635
They? Who's they?

203
00:12:33,636 --> 00:12:35,048
Dad didn't tell you.

204
00:12:35,237 --> 00:12:39,207
He told me about Regan, but that's
not what he wants to see me about.

205
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:41,409
That's what you wanted me to say.

206
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:44,846
I'm sure I don't care
what you say, Mr. Marlowe.

207
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:47,137
I'm wasting your time.

208
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:49,677
Goodbye, Mrs. Rutledge.

209
00:12:55,424 --> 00:12:57,258
Oh, Norris.

210
00:12:57,259 --> 00:13:00,428
You made a mistake. Mrs. Rutledge
didn't want to see me.

211
00:13:00,429 --> 00:13:03,987
I'm sorry, sir.
I make many mistakes.

212
00:13:32,528 --> 00:13:34,929
- Did you find what you wanted?
- Yes, thanks.

213
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:38,233
You don't look like a man who'd
be interested in first editions.

214
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:40,458
I collect blondes in bottles too.

215
00:13:58,487 --> 00:14:00,488
Can I be of any assistance?

216
00:14:00,489 --> 00:14:04,125
<i>Would you happen
to have a Ben Hur, 1860?</i>

217
00:14:04,126 --> 00:14:07,362
<i>- A what?
- Do you have a Ben Hur, 1860?</i>

218
00:14:07,363 --> 00:14:08,619
A first edition?

219
00:14:08,697 --> 00:14:11,099
No, no, the third, the third!

220
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,601
The one with the erratum on page 116.

221
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:15,094
I'm afraid not.

222
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:17,705
How about a Chevalier Audubon,
1840, full set?

223
00:14:17,706 --> 00:14:18,856
Not at the moment.

224
00:14:18,874 --> 00:14:20,483
You do sell books?

225
00:14:20,676 --> 00:14:23,111
What do those look like? Grapefruit?

226
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:26,014
They look like books.
Maybe I'd better see Mr. Geiger.

227
00:14:26,015 --> 00:14:28,880
- He's not in just now.
- That's a pity because...

228
00:14:38,427 --> 00:14:40,795
I said, Mr. Geiger is not in!

229
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:43,965
I heard you.
You needn't yell at me.

230
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:47,936
I'm late for my lecture on
Argentine ceramics, so I won't wait.

231
00:14:47,937 --> 00:14:49,537
The word is "ceramics".

232
00:14:49,538 --> 00:14:52,073
And they ain't Argentine,
they're Egyptian!

233
00:14:52,074 --> 00:14:54,709
You did sell a book once, didn't you?

234
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:56,477
I'll run along to the library.

235
00:14:56,478 --> 00:15:00,350
Or I could go to that bookstore
across the street, couldn't I?

236
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:01,761
Do so.

237
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:03,151
Thank you.

238
00:15:26,141 --> 00:15:28,076
Is there something I can do for you?

239
00:15:28,077 --> 00:15:31,674
- Would you do me a small favor?
- It depends on the favor.

240
00:15:31,981 --> 00:15:35,149
- You know Geiger's bookstore?
- I think I may have passed it.

241
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:37,177
You know Geiger by sight?

242
00:15:37,486 --> 00:15:39,317
What's he look like?

243
00:15:39,321 --> 00:15:41,923
Wouldn't it be easier to go
and ask to see him?

244
00:15:41,924 --> 00:15:44,030
I've already done that.

245
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:46,561
Know anything about rare books?

246
00:15:47,229 --> 00:15:48,760
You could try me.

247
00:15:48,764 --> 00:15:51,065
<i>Do you have a Ben Hur,
1860, third edition...</i>

248
00:15:51,066 --> 00:15:53,093
...with a duplicated line
on page 116?

249
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:03,637
Or a Chevalier Audubon, 1840?

250
00:16:09,952 --> 00:16:12,887
Nobody would. There isn't one.

251
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:15,988
The girl in Geiger's bookstore
didn't know that.

252
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,560
I see.

253
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:21,851
You begin to interest me, vaguely.

254
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,365
I'm a private dick on a case.

255
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:29,437
Perhaps I'm asking too much...

256
00:16:29,438 --> 00:16:31,884
...although it doesn't seem
too much to me.

257
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:37,034
Geiger's in his early forties...

258
00:16:37,112 --> 00:16:38,904
...medium height...

259
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:40,326
...fattish...

260
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:44,852
...soft all over,
Charlie Chan mustache...

261
00:16:44,853 --> 00:16:46,265
...well-dressed...

262
00:16:46,288 --> 00:16:48,512
...wears a black hat...

263
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:51,926
...affects a knowledge
of antiques and hasn't any...

264
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:55,396
...and I think his left eye is glass.

265
00:16:55,397 --> 00:16:57,464
You'd make a good cop.

266
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,987
Thanks.

267
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:04,191
Gonna wait for him to come out?

268
00:17:05,808 --> 00:17:08,543
They don't close
for another hour or so.

269
00:17:08,544 --> 00:17:10,878
And it's raining pretty hard.

270
00:17:10,879 --> 00:17:12,252
I got my car and...

271
00:17:16,218 --> 00:17:18,419
That's right.
It is, isn't it?

272
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:22,757
It just happens I got a bottle
of pretty good rye in my pocket.

273
00:17:22,758 --> 00:17:24,511
I'd rather get wet in here.

274
00:17:26,361 --> 00:17:28,009
Well!

275
00:17:38,407 --> 00:17:42,463
Looks like we're closed
for the rest of the afternoon.

276
00:17:47,449 --> 00:17:51,853
- Tell me more about this business.
- There isn't much to tell.

277
00:17:51,854 --> 00:17:53,502
What's the matter?

278
00:17:53,622 --> 00:17:56,526
I'm just wondering if you have to...

279
00:17:57,426 --> 00:17:59,650
Not necessarily.

280
00:18:06,602 --> 00:18:09,401
Little things like that make an...

281
00:18:09,938 --> 00:18:11,625
Hello!

282
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:28,578
I hate to tell you, but that's
Geiger's car driving up.

283
00:18:29,825 --> 00:18:31,392
Who's the man getting out?

284
00:18:31,393 --> 00:18:34,297
Geiger's shadow.
His name's Carol Lundgren.

285
00:18:35,164 --> 00:18:36,197
Thanks.

286
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:39,367
- If you ever want to buy a book...
- A Ben Hur, 1860?

287
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:40,780
With duplications.

288
00:18:40,803 --> 00:18:42,254
So long.

289
00:18:42,271 --> 00:18:44,102
So long, pal.

290
00:23:10,839 --> 00:23:12,095
You're cute.

291
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:15,142
And you're higher than a kite.
Come on, wake up.

292
00:23:15,143 --> 00:23:18,623
I know you. Doghouse Reilly.

293
00:23:19,214 --> 00:23:21,715
- You're cute.
- What do you know about this?

294
00:23:21,716 --> 00:23:23,783
Mr. Geiger, here on the floor.

295
00:23:24,386 --> 00:23:26,492
He's cute too.

296
00:23:27,722 --> 00:23:31,158
You got a dead man at your feet.
How did it happen?

297
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:33,724
You talk a lot, Reilly.

298
00:23:34,696 --> 00:23:36,449
Come on!

299
00:23:43,438 --> 00:23:45,139
Lie down there and be quiet.

300
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:47,246
All right, Reilly.

301
00:26:48,256 --> 00:26:50,087
Come on, we're going.

302
00:27:28,296 --> 00:27:30,297
- Good evening.
- Is Mrs. Rutledge in?

303
00:27:30,298 --> 00:27:31,790
- No, sir.
- The general?

304
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:34,443
- He's asleep.
- Good. I got something in the car.

305
00:27:34,836 --> 00:27:36,903
She's all right.
Is the maid around?

306
00:27:37,372 --> 00:27:39,006
Yes, I'll get Matilda.

307
00:27:39,007 --> 00:27:41,041
Now wait a minute.
Not as I'm leaving.

308
00:27:41,042 --> 00:27:43,844
I haven't been here.
You haven't seen me at all.

309
00:27:43,845 --> 00:27:45,679
Kid hasn't been out of the house.

310
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,614
I understand.
May I get you a cab?

311
00:27:47,615 --> 00:27:49,839
No, I'm all right.
Put her car away.

312
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:19,399
- Hello, Bernie. Come in.
- Hello, Phil.

313
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,695
Don't you ever go to bed?

314
00:30:20,735 --> 00:30:22,266
What you been doing?

315
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:23,565
Just sitting around.

316
00:30:23,605 --> 00:30:25,292
All evening?

317
00:30:26,307 --> 00:30:27,407
What is it?

318
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:29,209
Does it have to be something?

319
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:31,912
You're a friend, but when
a man from Homicide...

320
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:34,281
...just drops in at 2 a.m.,
I kind of...

321
00:30:34,282 --> 00:30:36,016
Working on cipher, huh?

322
00:30:36,017 --> 00:30:37,584
Just fooling around.

323
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:39,853
You're working for the Sternwoods,
right?

324
00:30:39,854 --> 00:30:41,385
Thanks to you.

325
00:30:41,389 --> 00:30:43,023
Done anything for them yet?

326
00:30:43,024 --> 00:30:45,248
I started today.
Then the rain came.

327
00:30:45,627 --> 00:30:49,563
All right. They seem to be
a family that things happen to.

328
00:30:49,564 --> 00:30:51,865
There's a Packard
belonging to them...

329
00:30:51,866 --> 00:30:54,966
...washing around in the surf
off Lido Pier.

330
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:57,671
And there's a guy in it.

331
00:30:57,672 --> 00:30:59,406
Couldn't be Regan, could it?

332
00:30:59,407 --> 00:31:01,121
Shawn Regan.

333
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:04,011
That Irish ex-legger
old Sternwood hired...

334
00:31:04,012 --> 00:31:06,146
...to do his drinking for him?

335
00:31:06,147 --> 00:31:08,582
What would he be doing down there?

336
00:31:08,583 --> 00:31:11,527
What would anybody
be doing down there?

337
00:31:11,553 --> 00:31:14,721
That's what I'm going to Lido
to find out. Wanna come?

338
00:31:14,722 --> 00:31:16,331
Yeah, I do.

339
00:31:16,724 --> 00:31:19,367
- How's the weather?
- Clearing up.

340
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:23,068
- What time did that call come in?
- About 15 minutes ago.

341
00:31:24,032 --> 00:31:27,290
- What kind of car you say it was?
- Packard.

342
00:31:43,818 --> 00:31:45,152
- Hello, Bernie.
- Hi, Ed.

343
00:31:45,186 --> 00:31:46,678
I see he's out.
Who is he?

344
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:50,557
Owen Taylor. Sternwood's chauffeur,
according to his license.

345
00:31:50,558 --> 00:31:52,926
- What's the story?
- You can see it from here.

346
00:31:52,927 --> 00:31:55,295
There's where he went
through the railing.

347
00:31:55,396 --> 00:31:57,431
The rain stopped here about 9 p.m.

348
00:31:57,432 --> 00:32:01,841
The broken rails are dry inside.
That would put it about 9:30.

349
00:32:10,244 --> 00:32:11,979
Let's have it, doc.

350
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:15,182
His neck's broken and something
hit him across the temple.

351
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:17,351
What made the bruise?
Steering wheel?

352
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:19,186
Whatever it was, it was covered.

353
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:22,289
The wound had bled under
the skin while he was alive.

354
00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:24,191
- Blackjack?
- Could be.

355
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:25,643
Bernie, funny thing.

356
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:28,161
The hand throttle is set
halfway down.

357
00:32:28,162 --> 00:32:30,497
Thanks, Jim. So long, doc.

358
00:32:30,498 --> 00:32:32,722
All right, boys. Take him away.

359
00:32:36,004 --> 00:32:39,406
- Could be drunk or a suicide.
- Yeah, but it isn't.

360
00:32:39,407 --> 00:32:41,642
You know anything about Owen Taylor?

361
00:32:41,643 --> 00:32:43,844
Only that a few
Sternwood chauffeurs...

362
00:32:43,845 --> 00:32:47,103
...lost their jobs because
of the younger daughter, Carmen.

363
00:32:47,248 --> 00:32:49,349
Tell me what
you're working on, Phil.

364
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:51,218
They told me blackmail.

365
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:53,325
Who were they after? Carmen?

366
00:32:54,088 --> 00:32:56,657
This doesn't look like
the way you'd handle it.

367
00:32:56,658 --> 00:32:58,792
You know, I got a feeling that...

368
00:32:58,793 --> 00:33:01,854
Me? I didn't do this.

369
00:33:02,363 --> 00:33:04,431
What were you going to say, Phil?

370
00:33:04,432 --> 00:33:07,734
Give me another day, Bernie.
I may have something for you.

371
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:09,422
Okay. Let's go home.

372
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:19,335
- I'm back again. Remember me?
- I'm afraid I...

373
00:33:22,684 --> 00:33:24,371
Do you remember me now?

374
00:33:24,719 --> 00:33:25,869
Now, see here!

375
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,758
That was only a stall
about those first editions.

376
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:32,993
I got something to sell.
Something Geiger wants. Is he in?

377
00:33:32,994 --> 00:33:35,495
No, he isn't.
You might come back tomorrow...

378
00:33:35,496 --> 00:33:37,998
Drop the veil.
I'm in the business myself.

379
00:33:37,999 --> 00:33:40,467
Is he sick?
I could go to his house.

380
00:33:40,468 --> 00:33:43,306
No, that wouldn't do.
If you'd come back tomorrow...

381
00:33:43,471 --> 00:33:45,263
Say, Agnes, you...

382
00:33:46,007 --> 00:33:47,721
Come on, Carol.

383
00:33:50,411 --> 00:33:52,125
Hurry up, will you?

384
00:33:53,181 --> 00:33:55,248
- Perhaps...
- His name's Lundgren, isn't it?

385
00:33:55,249 --> 00:33:57,084
- What do you want?
- Who's the other guy?

386
00:33:57,085 --> 00:33:58,952
You'd better come tomorrow.

387
00:33:58,953 --> 00:34:01,138
In the morning? Early?

388
00:34:01,489 --> 00:34:04,171
Because it looks like
you're moving today.

389
00:34:15,703 --> 00:34:17,966
All right, driver. Let's go!

390
00:34:22,677 --> 00:34:25,581
Around the corner, then take it easy.

391
00:34:25,847 --> 00:34:28,648
- Where are we going?
- Follow a car. A tail job.

392
00:34:28,649 --> 00:34:30,022
I'm your girl, bud.

393
00:34:30,051 --> 00:34:31,843
It wouldn't be bad.

394
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:36,277
That station wagon coming out
of the alley. That's the one.

395
00:35:21,669 --> 00:35:23,837
Here, sugar.
Buy yourself a cigar.

396
00:35:23,838 --> 00:35:27,140
If you can use me again sometime,
call this number.

397
00:35:27,141 --> 00:35:28,291
Day and night?

398
00:35:28,309 --> 00:35:31,867
Night's better.
I work during the day.

399
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:44,591
- Good morning.
- You do get up.

400
00:35:44,592 --> 00:35:47,561
I was thinking you worked in bed,
like Marcel Proust.

401
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:50,400
- Who's he?
- A French writer.

402
00:35:51,933 --> 00:35:54,118
Come into my boudoir.

403
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:03,910
You don't put on a front.

404
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:06,012
Not much money in this work
if you're honest.

405
00:36:06,013 --> 00:36:07,308
Are you honest?

406
00:36:07,348 --> 00:36:10,851
- We're starting that again?
- I'm sorry. Also, about yesterday.

407
00:36:10,852 --> 00:36:13,920
- Perhaps I was rude.
- We were both rude.

408
00:36:13,921 --> 00:36:15,856
You want to see me about Taylor?

409
00:36:15,857 --> 00:36:17,963
So you know about that.

410
00:36:18,492 --> 00:36:21,528
- Poor Owen.
- The DA's man took me down to Lido.

411
00:36:21,529 --> 00:36:23,930
He knew more about him than I did.

412
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:26,900
He knew Owen Taylor wanted
to marry your sister.

413
00:36:26,901 --> 00:36:29,302
Perhaps it wouldn't
have been a bad idea.

414
00:36:29,303 --> 00:36:31,504
You see, he was in love with her.

415
00:36:31,505 --> 00:36:34,226
But I didn't come here about Owen.

416
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:38,011
You still can't tell me
what my father wants you to do?

417
00:36:38,012 --> 00:36:39,579
Not without his permission.

418
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:42,418
You can't even tell me
if it was about Carmen?

419
00:36:43,918 --> 00:36:47,087
You better look at this.
A messenger brought it today.

420
00:36:47,088 --> 00:36:48,880
"Eight thirty-five".

421
00:36:48,923 --> 00:36:50,610
That's right.

422
00:36:52,093 --> 00:36:54,238
She takes a nice picture.

423
00:36:54,362 --> 00:36:56,830
They want 5000 for
the negative and prints.

424
00:36:56,831 --> 00:36:58,243
The demand came how?

425
00:36:58,266 --> 00:37:00,467
A woman phoned me
after it was delivered.

426
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:02,969
- What else?
- There has to be something else?

427
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:05,338
This thing isn't
worth $5000 to anybody.

428
00:37:05,339 --> 00:37:07,445
- They think it is.
- Why?

429
00:37:07,575 --> 00:37:09,876
She said if they didn't
get the money today...

430
00:37:09,877 --> 00:37:12,913
...I'd be talking to my sister
through a wire screen.

431
00:37:12,914 --> 00:37:15,315
She said there was a police jam
connected with it.

432
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:16,728
What kind of a jam?

433
00:37:16,751 --> 00:37:18,582
I don't know.

434
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,955
You know where
this picture was taken?

435
00:37:21,956 --> 00:37:25,158
- I haven't the slightest idea.
- Or when?

436
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:26,726
Talk to Carmen about it?

437
00:37:26,727 --> 00:37:29,529
She was asleep when I left.
She was sick last night.

438
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:32,732
- She go out at all?
- Servants say she didn't.

439
00:37:32,733 --> 00:37:33,883
You?

440
00:37:33,901 --> 00:37:37,734
I was out all evening.
Police already checked that.

441
00:37:38,205 --> 00:37:40,193
Go ahead and scratch.

442
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:45,312
What was Owen doing
with your car last night?

443
00:37:45,313 --> 00:37:47,995
Nobody knows.
He took it without permission.

444
00:37:48,082 --> 00:37:50,350
- Why? You think...
- That he knew about this?

445
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:52,182
I don't rule him out.

446
00:37:53,087 --> 00:37:54,988
Outside of what the woman said...

447
00:37:54,989 --> 00:37:57,593
...you don't know why
they want $5000 for it?

448
00:37:59,961 --> 00:38:01,795
That's why I came to you.

449
00:38:01,796 --> 00:38:05,498
There's five fingers on any glove.
Why didn't you go to the police?

450
00:38:05,499 --> 00:38:08,201
You were afraid they'd find
something I couldn't sit on.

451
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:10,470
Then where would the Sternwoods be?

452
00:38:10,471 --> 00:38:13,336
May I use your phone, Mr. Marlowe?

453
00:38:20,081 --> 00:38:23,181
Police headquarters, please.

454
00:38:24,151 --> 00:38:25,982
Hello, this is Mrs...

455
00:38:28,422 --> 00:38:30,567
Hello. What do you want, please?

456
00:38:31,092 --> 00:38:32,225
What?

457
00:38:32,226 --> 00:38:33,757
I called you?

458
00:38:33,761 --> 00:38:35,553
Say, who is this?

459
00:38:35,896 --> 00:38:39,366
Sergeant Reilly?
There isn't any Sergeant Reilly here.

460
00:38:39,367 --> 00:38:42,232
Wait a minute.
You'd better talk to my mother.

461
00:38:45,272 --> 00:38:47,299
Hello. Who's this?

462
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:50,010
The police?
This isn't a police station.

463
00:38:50,011 --> 00:38:51,462
If you know it, why did...

464
00:38:51,512 --> 00:38:55,031
Look, this is not a police station!

465
00:38:55,082 --> 00:38:57,450
What was that you said?

466
00:38:57,718 --> 00:39:00,583
My father should hear this.

467
00:39:02,490 --> 00:39:04,361
Hello. Who is this?

468
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:06,693
Yeah, but she just told you that...

469
00:39:06,694 --> 00:39:08,628
You're the police!
He's the police.

470
00:39:08,629 --> 00:39:11,651
Well, that's different.
What can I do for you?

471
00:39:12,166 --> 00:39:13,617
I can do what?

472
00:39:13,701 --> 00:39:14,851
Where?

473
00:39:14,869 --> 00:39:18,663
Oh, no! I wouldn't like that,
and neither would my daughter.

474
00:39:18,873 --> 00:39:21,508
I hope the sergeant
never traces that call.

475
00:39:21,509 --> 00:39:24,649
You like to play games, don't you?

476
00:39:24,879 --> 00:39:26,780
Why did you stop me phoning?

477
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:28,882
Because I'm working for your father.

478
00:39:28,883 --> 00:39:33,186
Or because I think I'm beginning to
like another one of the Sternwoods.

479
00:39:33,187 --> 00:39:35,869
I prefer the second reason.

480
00:39:36,023 --> 00:39:40,860
Well, let's get back to business.
Have you got $5000 in cash?

481
00:39:40,861 --> 00:39:42,662
- Can you get it?
- I think so.

482
00:39:42,663 --> 00:39:45,598
- Where from, your father?
- I'd rather not.

483
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:47,169
Where would you get it?

484
00:39:47,201 --> 00:39:49,469
Well, from Eddie Mars.

485
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:50,537
The gambler?

486
00:39:50,538 --> 00:39:53,440
That explains why you
haven't got $5000 in cash.

487
00:39:53,441 --> 00:39:55,233
- I like gambling.
- So do I.

488
00:39:55,543 --> 00:39:58,478
- How do you know he'll give it to you?
- I can get it.

489
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:00,880
I've been a good customer
of Eddie Mars'.

490
00:40:00,881 --> 00:40:02,373
Another reason:

491
00:40:02,383 --> 00:40:06,186
There's a bond between
Mr. Mars and the Sternwoods.

492
00:40:06,187 --> 00:40:09,405
You see, Shawn Regan ran off
with Eddie's wife.

493
00:40:09,423 --> 00:40:11,411
That doesn't interest you?

494
00:40:12,026 --> 00:40:15,048
It might make it easier
for me to find him.

495
00:40:15,162 --> 00:40:16,496
If I were looking for him.

496
00:40:18,365 --> 00:40:20,333
Is Regan mixed up in this?

497
00:40:20,334 --> 00:40:23,570
No. Shawn's not in any
cheap blackmailing scheme.

498
00:40:23,571 --> 00:40:26,773
I'm glad you said that.
Do you want to tell me now?

499
00:40:26,774 --> 00:40:30,188
- Tell you what?
- What you're trying to find out.

500
00:40:30,744 --> 00:40:32,579
You know, it's a funny thing.

501
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:35,115
You're trying to find out
why I was hired.

502
00:40:35,116 --> 00:40:36,950
And I'm trying to find out why you...

503
00:40:36,951 --> 00:40:39,252
You could go on forever,
couldn't you?

504
00:40:39,253 --> 00:40:42,197
It'll give us something
to talk about next time.

505
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:44,999
Among other things.
Oh, Mrs. Rutledge.

506
00:40:45,059 --> 00:40:48,277
You wanted me to do something
about this, didn't you?

507
00:40:48,295 --> 00:40:49,996
That call, how'd you leave it?

508
00:40:49,997 --> 00:40:52,298
She's to call me at 6 p.m.
with instructions.

509
00:40:52,299 --> 00:40:54,467
Phone me when you've heard from her.

510
00:40:54,468 --> 00:40:57,170
Since you're going
to pay five grand for these...

511
00:40:57,171 --> 00:40:58,663
...you'd better take this.

512
00:40:58,672 --> 00:41:00,857
Goodbye, Mr. Marlowe.

513
00:41:04,044 --> 00:41:05,845
Well, it wasn't intentional.

514
00:41:05,846 --> 00:41:08,070
Try it sometime.

515
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:46,252
- What are you...
- Remember me? I'm Doghouse Reilly.

516
00:41:46,253 --> 00:41:48,388
The man that didn't grow very tall.

517
00:41:48,389 --> 00:41:50,993
What's the matter?
Couldn't you get in the house?

518
00:41:51,458 --> 00:41:53,787
Come on. I've got a key.

519
00:41:54,662 --> 00:41:58,142
- Where'd you leave your car?
- Around in back.

520
00:42:14,515 --> 00:42:16,007
Looking for something?

521
00:42:16,016 --> 00:42:18,518
How much do you remember
about last night?

522
00:42:18,519 --> 00:42:21,921
Remember what?
I was sick last night. I was home.

523
00:42:21,922 --> 00:42:24,624
Before you went home.
In that chair there.

524
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:27,060
You remember, all right.

525
00:42:27,061 --> 00:42:29,696
Quit your stalling
and stop biting your thumb!

526
00:42:29,697 --> 00:42:32,966
- Were you the one who was here?
- How much do you remember?

527
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:35,134
Are you the police?

528
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:37,103
No, I'm a friend of your father's.

529
00:42:37,104 --> 00:42:39,131
Who killed Geiger?

530
00:42:39,707 --> 00:42:41,238
Who else knows about it?

531
00:42:41,242 --> 00:42:43,176
What, that he's dead?
I don't know.

532
00:42:43,177 --> 00:42:47,080
Not the cops, or they'd be camping
here. Was it Joe Brody?

533
00:42:47,081 --> 00:42:49,605
Joe Brody. Who's he?

534
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:52,552
I don't know how much trouble
you're used to...

535
00:42:52,553 --> 00:42:55,455
...but I hope you've had plenty
of practice dodging it.

536
00:42:55,456 --> 00:42:56,868
Did Brody kill him?

537
00:42:56,890 --> 00:42:58,538
Kill who?

538
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:04,497
Yes, Joe did it.

539
00:43:04,498 --> 00:43:06,068
He did?

540
00:43:07,935 --> 00:43:09,230
Why?

541
00:43:09,770 --> 00:43:11,182
I don't know.

542
00:43:11,205 --> 00:43:13,640
But you're ready to tell
the police he did it?

543
00:43:13,641 --> 00:43:15,642
That is, if we can get
the photograph.

544
00:43:15,643 --> 00:43:16,676
You mean...?

545
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:19,612
It's gone. I looked for it.
Brody took it with him.

546
00:43:19,613 --> 00:43:21,876
I've got to go home now.

547
00:43:22,116 --> 00:43:25,852
I wouldn't say anything
to the police about Brody just yet.

548
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:28,321
I wouldn't say anything
about anything.

549
00:43:28,322 --> 00:43:31,791
That you were ever here.
Not even to your sister.

550
00:43:31,792 --> 00:43:33,977
Just leave it to Reilly.

551
00:43:34,395 --> 00:43:37,077
Your name isn't Reilly...

552
00:43:50,377 --> 00:43:53,713
Excuse the casual entrance.
The bell didn't answer.

553
00:43:54,148 --> 00:43:55,443
Mr. Geiger around?

554
00:43:55,482 --> 00:43:57,150
We don't know where he is.

555
00:43:57,151 --> 00:43:59,716
We found the door open
and just stepped in.

556
00:44:01,288 --> 00:44:02,897
- Friends of his?
- Business.

557
00:44:03,123 --> 00:44:05,111
We dropped in for a book.

558
00:44:05,125 --> 00:44:06,893
Any message if he comes back?

559
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:10,229
No, I don't think so.
We won't bother you.

560
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:11,839
Just a minute.

561
00:44:12,366 --> 00:44:13,933
The girl can go.

562
00:44:13,934 --> 00:44:17,070
- I'd like to talk to you.
- Suppose I don't want to talk?

563
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:19,020
I've got two boys out in the car.

564
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,307
It's like that, eh?

565
00:44:23,477 --> 00:44:25,387
Run along, angel.

566
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:33,839
Your story doesn't sound right.

567
00:44:33,887 --> 00:44:36,032
That's too bad.
Got a better one?

568
00:44:36,990 --> 00:44:38,861
Maybe I can find one.

569
00:44:45,432 --> 00:44:47,734
Blood.
Quite a lot of blood.

570
00:44:47,735 --> 00:44:49,566
Is that so?

571
00:44:49,570 --> 00:44:52,514
- Do you mind?
- No, I'm used to it.

572
00:44:52,639 --> 00:44:55,041
I think we'll let
the police in on this.

573
00:44:55,042 --> 00:44:57,488
- We'll have some law...
- Yeah. Why not?

574
00:44:58,178 --> 00:44:59,473
Who are you, soldier?

575
00:44:59,513 --> 00:45:01,614
Marlowe.
I'm a private detective.

576
00:45:01,615 --> 00:45:03,146
- Who's the girl?
- A client.

577
00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:06,185
Geiger tried to throw a loop on her.
We came to talk.

578
00:45:06,186 --> 00:45:10,423
- Convenient, the door being open.
- Wasn't it? How'd you have a key?

579
00:45:10,424 --> 00:45:12,325
- That your business?
- Could be.

580
00:45:12,326 --> 00:45:13,699
I could make yours mine.

581
00:45:13,727 --> 00:45:16,631
You wouldn't like it.
The pay's too small.

582
00:45:17,765 --> 00:45:20,500
All right, I own this house.
Geiger's my tenant.

583
00:45:20,501 --> 00:45:23,202
- Now what do you think?
- You know some nice people.

584
00:45:23,203 --> 00:45:25,230
I take them as they come.

585
00:45:25,606 --> 00:45:26,784
Got any good ideas?

586
00:45:26,874 --> 00:45:29,275
One or two.
Somebody gunned Geiger.

587
00:45:29,276 --> 00:45:31,511
Or somebody got gunned
by Geiger, who ran away.

588
00:45:31,512 --> 00:45:34,614
Or he had meat for dinner
and likes to butcher in the parlor.

589
00:45:34,615 --> 00:45:38,251
No, I don't like it either.
Maybe you'd better call downtown.

590
00:45:38,252 --> 00:45:40,620
I don't get it.
I don't get your game.

591
00:45:40,621 --> 00:45:41,955
Don't you, Mr. Mars?

592
00:45:42,456 --> 00:45:44,891
Wondered why you didn't
ask me who I was.

593
00:45:44,892 --> 00:45:47,914
You're telling me Geiger was
in a racket of some kind.

594
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:49,896
- What racket?
- I wouldn't know.

595
00:45:49,897 --> 00:45:52,198
But I'll tell you
something you missed.

596
00:45:52,199 --> 00:45:54,803
Somebody cleaned out
Geiger's store today.

597
00:45:54,902 --> 00:45:56,569
You talk too much.

598
00:45:56,570 --> 00:45:59,016
You really got those boys outside?

599
00:46:00,707 --> 00:46:01,857
Open the door.

600
00:46:01,875 --> 00:46:04,936
Open it yourself.
I already got a client.

601
00:46:09,216 --> 00:46:11,517
It's all right.
Just proving something.

602
00:46:11,518 --> 00:46:13,467
While you're here, look him over.

603
00:46:18,959 --> 00:46:20,860
- Pardon me.
- Who is he?

604
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:23,796
Philip Marlowe, Hobart Arms,
Franklin Street.

605
00:46:23,797 --> 00:46:26,098
Special license,
deputy badge and all.

606
00:46:26,099 --> 00:46:27,277
All right, outside.

607
00:46:27,334 --> 00:46:29,602
- A shamus.
- The man said, outside.

608
00:46:29,603 --> 00:46:33,580
He said that.
That's what the man said.

609
00:46:35,342 --> 00:46:37,134
He kills me.

610
00:46:38,846 --> 00:46:40,024
Is he any good?

611
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:43,015
Who? Sidney?
He's company for Pete.

612
00:46:43,016 --> 00:46:44,233
All right, talk.

613
00:46:44,284 --> 00:46:46,686
Not to you.
I already got a client.

614
00:46:46,687 --> 00:46:48,788
Who cleaned out Geiger's store?

615
00:46:48,789 --> 00:46:51,757
Lots of weather we're having.
Did it rain at Las Olindas?

616
00:46:51,758 --> 00:46:53,826
I might make it worth your while.

617
00:46:53,827 --> 00:46:55,358
I might make it worth yours.

618
00:46:55,362 --> 00:46:58,064
What do you care
who cleaned out Geiger's store?

619
00:46:58,065 --> 00:47:00,233
- I could make you talk.
- It's been tried.

620
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:01,685
And?

621
00:47:01,969 --> 00:47:03,903
Why don't you call the cops?

622
00:47:03,904 --> 00:47:06,469
I think you'd better
get out of here.

623
00:47:07,207 --> 00:47:10,999
By the way,
how's Mrs. Mars these days?

624
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,446
You take chances, Marlowe.

625
00:47:13,803 --> 00:47:15,752
I get paid to.

626
00:47:35,488 --> 00:47:38,323
Mrs. Rutledge. I've been
waiting to hear from you.

627
00:47:38,324 --> 00:47:41,160
<i>I'm sorry.
I have nothing to tell you.</i>

628
00:47:41,161 --> 00:47:43,428
<i>- She didn't call?
- No, she didn't.</i>

629
00:47:43,429 --> 00:47:47,365
Did you get the money
in case she does?

630
00:47:47,366 --> 00:47:52,369
<i>I have the money. I'll get in touch
with you as soon as she calls.</i>

631
00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:56,203
All right, I'll stay
right here until you call.

632
00:49:20,883 --> 00:49:22,295
Geiger?

633
00:49:22,317 --> 00:49:24,184
- You said what?
- Arthur Geiger.

634
00:49:24,185 --> 00:49:26,186
The guy with the blackmail racket.

635
00:49:26,187 --> 00:49:29,589
- I don't know anybody by that name.
- You're Joe Brody?

636
00:49:29,590 --> 00:49:31,858
- So what?
- So you're Joe Brody.

637
00:49:31,859 --> 00:49:34,293
And you don't know Geiger.
That's very funny.

638
00:49:34,294 --> 00:49:37,963
You've got a funny sense of humor.
Take it somewhere else.

639
00:49:37,964 --> 00:49:41,400
Joe, you got Geiger's stuff.
I got his sucker list.

640
00:49:41,401 --> 00:49:43,334
Don't you think we ought to talk?

641
00:49:43,335 --> 00:49:44,786
Now!

642
00:49:45,838 --> 00:49:48,598
All right. If you think
you got something.

643
00:49:53,044 --> 00:49:54,614
You alone, Joe?

644
00:49:55,446 --> 00:49:57,591
Except for this.

645
00:49:58,183 --> 00:50:02,618
My, my, such a lot of guns
around town and so few brains.

646
00:50:02,619 --> 00:50:04,787
You're the second guy
today that thinks...

647
00:50:04,788 --> 00:50:08,006
...a gat in the hand
means the world by the tail.

648
00:50:08,826 --> 00:50:10,692
Put it down, Joe.

649
00:50:10,693 --> 00:50:13,461
The other guy was Eddie Mars.
You ever hear of him?

650
00:50:13,462 --> 00:50:16,698
If he gets wise to where you were
last night, you'll hear of him.

651
00:50:16,699 --> 00:50:18,499
What would I be to Eddie Mars?

652
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:20,501
I don't know if you don't.

653
00:50:20,502 --> 00:50:22,903
Look, don't get me wrong.

654
00:50:22,904 --> 00:50:24,505
I'm not a tough guy.

655
00:50:24,506 --> 00:50:25,684
Just careful.

656
00:50:25,841 --> 00:50:27,333
You're not careful enough.

657
00:50:27,342 --> 00:50:30,376
That play with Geiger's stuff
was terrible.

658
00:50:30,377 --> 00:50:33,913
Don't kid yourself I won't
use this if I have to.

659
00:50:33,914 --> 00:50:35,048
What's your story?

660
00:50:35,049 --> 00:50:37,349
Why don't you ask
your friend to come out?

661
00:50:37,350 --> 00:50:39,418
She must get tired
of holding her breath.

662
00:50:39,419 --> 00:50:41,253
Come on out, Agnes.

663
00:50:41,254 --> 00:50:42,387
Hello, sugar.

664
00:50:42,388 --> 00:50:44,423
I knew you were trouble.
I told Joe...

665
00:50:44,424 --> 00:50:47,562
Ask Mrs. Rutledge to come out too.

666
00:50:49,695 --> 00:50:50,873
What did you come for?

667
00:50:50,929 --> 00:50:53,431
- Why'd you lie to me?
- I don't need you.

668
00:50:53,432 --> 00:50:54,465
Keep out of it!

669
00:50:54,466 --> 00:50:56,566
I don't want you here.
Will you get out?

670
00:50:56,567 --> 00:51:00,003
But he won't let me.
He's curious, bothered and wondering.

671
00:51:00,004 --> 00:51:02,272
You bet I'm wondering
and I'll find out.

672
00:51:02,273 --> 00:51:03,907
- Sit down.
- Stop waving that gun.

673
00:51:03,908 --> 00:51:06,876
I didn't do anything.
Can't you talk without that?

674
00:51:06,877 --> 00:51:08,408
Don't argue with the man.

675
00:51:08,411 --> 00:51:11,113
- You're ruining things.
- I'm not. If you'd...

676
00:51:11,114 --> 00:51:12,606
Say, look!

677
00:51:12,616 --> 00:51:14,215
What are you up here for?

678
00:51:14,216 --> 00:51:17,986
To keep her from paying you off,
and to take the cops off your neck.

679
00:51:17,987 --> 00:51:19,321
What cops?

680
00:51:19,355 --> 00:51:23,070
The cops that want to know
where the lead in Geiger came from.

681
00:51:23,491 --> 00:51:25,125
Look, Joe, you shot Geiger.

682
00:51:25,126 --> 00:51:26,894
- I didn't know...
- The cops don't yet.

683
00:51:26,895 --> 00:51:28,766
He wasn't alone
when you shot him.

684
00:51:29,264 --> 00:51:33,232
Either you didn't notice that
or you got scared and ran away.

685
00:51:33,233 --> 00:51:35,401
But you had nerve enough
to take the film.

686
00:51:35,402 --> 00:51:38,237
And nerve enough
to come back and hide the body.

687
00:51:38,238 --> 00:51:39,839
- You're crazy!
- Shut up!

688
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:42,274
So you could clean out the store...

689
00:51:42,275 --> 00:51:44,996
...before the law knew
there was a murder.

690
00:51:45,044 --> 00:51:48,413
You take chances. It's lucky
for you I didn't shoot Geiger.

691
00:51:48,414 --> 00:51:52,116
But you can step off for it anyway.
You're made-to-order for the rap.

692
00:51:52,117 --> 00:51:53,295
You think you've got me?

693
00:51:53,351 --> 00:51:54,568
- Positive.
- How come?

694
00:51:54,619 --> 00:51:59,088
I told you, there was a witness.
Now don't go simple on me.

695
00:51:59,089 --> 00:52:01,691
You mean Carmen.
She'd say anything.

696
00:52:01,692 --> 00:52:03,826
So you have got that picture.

697
00:52:03,827 --> 00:52:05,461
I guess you think I'm dumb.

698
00:52:05,462 --> 00:52:07,697
Just average, for a grafter.

699
00:52:07,698 --> 00:52:10,265
You see, either you were
there last night...

700
00:52:10,266 --> 00:52:13,135
...or you got the picture
from somebody who was.

701
00:52:13,136 --> 00:52:14,836
You knew Carmen was there...

702
00:52:14,837 --> 00:52:18,039
...because you had your girlfriend
threaten Mrs. Rutledge.

703
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:21,108
The only way you could have known
was by being there...

704
00:52:21,109 --> 00:52:23,945
...and seeing what happened.
Or having the picture.

705
00:52:23,946 --> 00:52:25,096
Make sense?

706
00:52:25,113 --> 00:52:26,408
Who are you?

707
00:52:26,447 --> 00:52:28,982
A guy who gets paid to do
people's laundry.

708
00:52:28,983 --> 00:52:31,718
And all I'll get out
of it is that picture.

709
00:52:31,719 --> 00:52:34,087
How about some dough?
I'm down to nickels.

710
00:52:34,088 --> 00:52:37,842
Not from my client.
Get the picture, Joe.

711
00:52:41,661 --> 00:52:43,532
Stay right there.

712
00:52:46,999 --> 00:52:49,026
Here. Watch him.

713
00:53:02,113 --> 00:53:04,113
- Take it easy.
- I want my picture.

714
00:53:04,114 --> 00:53:05,801
- Now...
- I want my picture.

715
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:07,641
You shot Geiger.

716
00:53:09,419 --> 00:53:10,714
Hold it!

717
00:53:12,688 --> 00:53:16,404
Get up. You look like a Pekinese.
And since I'm collecting guns...

718
00:53:16,859 --> 00:53:18,860
Sit down, sugar.
Now where were we?

719
00:53:18,861 --> 00:53:21,843
Oh, yes, you were just about
to get something.

720
00:53:31,572 --> 00:53:33,473
There better not be
any more prints.

721
00:53:33,474 --> 00:53:35,044
There won't be.

722
00:53:40,346 --> 00:53:42,831
Can I have my picture now?

723
00:53:43,950 --> 00:53:45,100
Can I have my gun?

724
00:53:45,151 --> 00:53:46,301
Later.

725
00:53:49,221 --> 00:53:51,555
You're cute. I like you.

726
00:53:51,556 --> 00:53:56,260
This is nothing. I got a Balinese
dancing girl tattooed on my chest.

727
00:53:56,261 --> 00:53:58,405
You better take her home.

728
00:53:59,830 --> 00:54:01,865
I suppose I should thank you.

729
00:54:01,866 --> 00:54:04,704
No, just don't lie to me next time.

730
00:54:04,969 --> 00:54:06,800
Come on, Carmen.

731
00:54:08,471 --> 00:54:10,080
Hold it, Joe.

732
00:54:15,178 --> 00:54:17,745
You got off easy, Joe.
What's the matter, sugar?

733
00:54:17,746 --> 00:54:20,081
- He gives me a pain...
- Goes for me too.

734
00:54:20,082 --> 00:54:21,416
You got the photos.
Get out.

735
00:54:21,450 --> 00:54:23,217
- Where's the pain?
- In my...

736
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:24,285
Get out!

737
00:54:24,286 --> 00:54:26,920
Not yet. We got a few things
to straighten out.

738
00:54:26,921 --> 00:54:28,177
I told you to get out.

739
00:54:28,222 --> 00:54:30,323
What difference does it make now?

740
00:54:30,324 --> 00:54:32,626
Why'd you put the bee
on Mrs. Rutledge?

741
00:54:32,627 --> 00:54:36,128
I tapped the old man six months ago.
I figured it might not work twice.

742
00:54:36,129 --> 00:54:38,564
Why'd you think
Mrs. Rutledge wouldn't tell him?

743
00:54:38,565 --> 00:54:41,167
- How well do you know her?
- We'll pass that.

744
00:54:41,168 --> 00:54:45,537
I figured she might have a thing
or two she wouldn't want him to know.

745
00:54:45,538 --> 00:54:48,139
That's a little weak,
but we'll pass that too.

746
00:54:48,140 --> 00:54:50,442
Say, Joe, how'd you get that picture?

747
00:54:50,443 --> 00:54:52,810
You got what you came for,
and you got it cheap.

748
00:54:52,811 --> 00:54:55,279
I don't know anything about it.
Do I, Agnes?

749
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:57,848
- But you just gave it to me.
- A half-smart guy.

750
00:54:57,849 --> 00:54:59,583
That's what I always draw.

751
00:54:59,584 --> 00:55:03,519
Never once a man who's smart
all the way around the course.

752
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:04,815
Did I hurt you much?

753
00:55:04,855 --> 00:55:06,589
You and every other man.

754
00:55:06,590 --> 00:55:08,082
Where'd you get that picture?

755
00:55:08,258 --> 00:55:09,826
It fell out of somebody's pocket.

756
00:55:09,827 --> 00:55:13,240
- Got an alibi for last night?
- I was here with Agnes.

757
00:55:14,063 --> 00:55:15,831
That's a great witness.

758
00:55:15,832 --> 00:55:18,867
You can only die once,
even for a couple of murders.

759
00:55:18,868 --> 00:55:20,240
A couple of murders?

760
00:55:20,268 --> 00:55:23,537
I mean two murders. Where were you
about 7:30 last night?

761
00:55:23,538 --> 00:55:24,911
Where were you?

762
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:27,108
All right, I was watching
Geiger's place.

763
00:55:27,109 --> 00:55:28,560
Why?

764
00:55:28,577 --> 00:55:31,778
- To get something on him.
- Look at me while you're talking.

765
00:55:31,779 --> 00:55:34,247
It was raining hard
and I was in my car.

766
00:55:34,248 --> 00:55:38,250
There was a car out front and another
down the hill. I was in back.

767
00:55:38,251 --> 00:55:40,185
- Who else was back there?
- Nobody.

768
00:55:40,186 --> 00:55:43,455
There was a big Packard near
where I was, so I took a look.

769
00:55:43,456 --> 00:55:45,858
It was registered to the Sternwoods.

770
00:55:45,859 --> 00:55:49,760
Nothing happened, so I got tired
of waiting and I went home.

771
00:55:49,761 --> 00:55:51,963
Know where that Packard is now?

772
00:55:51,964 --> 00:55:54,132
It's in the sheriff's garage.

773
00:55:54,133 --> 00:55:57,701
It was fished out of 12 feet of water
off Lido Pier this morning.

774
00:55:57,702 --> 00:55:59,503
There was a dead man in it.

775
00:55:59,504 --> 00:56:02,506
It was pointed toward
the pier and the throttle pulled out.

776
00:56:02,507 --> 00:56:04,908
- You can't pin that on me.
- I can try.

777
00:56:04,909 --> 00:56:06,700
Sit down, Joe.

778
00:56:08,645 --> 00:56:11,981
The dead man was Owen Taylor,
Sternwood's chauffeur.

779
00:56:11,982 --> 00:56:14,983
He went up to Geiger's
because he was sweet on Carmen.

780
00:56:14,984 --> 00:56:17,719
He didn't like the games
Geiger was playing.

781
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:20,889
He let himself in the back
with a jimmy and he had a gun.

782
00:56:20,890 --> 00:56:24,791
The gun went off, as guns will,
and Geiger fell down dead.

783
00:56:24,792 --> 00:56:28,428
Owen ran with the film.
You went after him and got it.

784
00:56:28,429 --> 00:56:30,731
All right, you're right.
I heard the shots...

785
00:56:30,732 --> 00:56:33,900
...and saw him run out and
enter the Packard and away.

786
00:56:33,901 --> 00:56:35,313
I followed him.

787
00:56:35,335 --> 00:56:37,859
He turned west on Sunset.

788
00:56:38,071 --> 00:56:40,039
And beyond Beverly...

789
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:44,209
...he skidded off the road
and came to a stop.

790
00:56:44,210 --> 00:56:46,745
So I came up and played copper.

791
00:56:46,746 --> 00:56:50,348
He had a gun. He was rattled,
so I sapped him down.

792
00:56:50,349 --> 00:56:53,384
I figured the film might be
worth something, so I took it.

793
00:56:53,385 --> 00:56:55,491
That's the last I saw of him.

794
00:56:56,388 --> 00:57:00,257
So you left an unconscious man
in a car way out near Beverly.

795
00:57:00,258 --> 00:57:02,926
And you want me to believe
somebody came along...

796
00:57:02,927 --> 00:57:05,929
...ran that car to the ocean,
pushed it off the pier...

797
00:57:05,930 --> 00:57:07,764
...then hid Geiger's body?

798
00:57:07,765 --> 00:57:10,065
- Well, I didn't...
- Somebody did.

799
00:57:10,066 --> 00:57:12,467
You wanted time to take over.

800
00:57:12,468 --> 00:57:14,436
You can't prove I did it.

801
00:57:14,437 --> 00:57:16,605
I don't particularly want to.

802
00:57:16,606 --> 00:57:21,014
All I want to do is find out
what Geiger had on the Sternwoods.

803
00:57:21,443 --> 00:57:23,889
Maybe you and I can make
a little deal.

804
00:57:24,513 --> 00:57:25,886
Go ahead.

805
00:57:32,019 --> 00:57:33,392
Maybe she's back.

806
00:57:33,421 --> 00:57:36,103
If she is, she hasn't got her gun.

807
00:58:55,627 --> 00:58:57,458
You got a match, bud?

808
00:59:00,665 --> 00:59:02,932
What'll it be, kid?
Me or the cops?

809
00:59:02,933 --> 00:59:04,464
What do you want?

810
00:59:07,672 --> 00:59:10,615
Sit in that car,
back of the wheel. You drive.

811
00:59:15,412 --> 00:59:19,623
As soon as this police car goes by,
we're going to Geiger's house.

812
00:59:20,516 --> 00:59:22,984
By the way, Carol,
you shot the wrong guy.

813
00:59:22,985 --> 00:59:25,275
Brody didn't kill Geiger.

814
00:59:26,121 --> 00:59:27,833
All right, let's go.

815
00:59:50,042 --> 00:59:53,679
- You got a key. Let's go in.
- Who said I got a key?

816
00:59:58,383 --> 00:59:59,678
All right, come on!

817
01:00:00,919 --> 01:00:02,868
Maybe you need this.

818
01:01:11,148 --> 01:01:13,097
<i>- Hello.
- Hello, Bernie?</i>

819
01:01:13,216 --> 01:01:15,050
<i>Is this who I think it is?</i>

820
01:01:15,051 --> 01:01:17,619
It's Marlowe.
How are you fixed for red points?

821
01:01:17,620 --> 01:01:19,032
<i>I haven't got any.</i>

822
01:01:19,054 --> 01:01:20,585
Who has?

823
01:01:20,589 --> 01:01:23,825
I got some cold meat set out,
might interest you.

824
01:01:23,826 --> 01:01:25,426
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

825
01:01:25,427 --> 01:01:29,263
You find a gun on Owen Taylor
when they fished him out of the drink?

826
01:01:29,264 --> 01:01:33,434
- That's police business.
- I know it's police business.

827
01:01:33,435 --> 01:01:36,536
But if they did,
it had three empty shells in it.

828
01:01:36,537 --> 01:01:39,172
You come up to
7244 Laverne Terrace...

829
01:01:39,173 --> 01:01:41,574
...off Laurel Canyon.
I'll show you where the slugs went.

830
01:01:41,575 --> 01:01:44,518
<i>- I'll be right out.
- I'll be waiting for you.</i>

831
01:01:44,577 --> 01:01:47,142
What did you hide Geiger's body for?

832
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:50,148
- Do you admit shooting Brody?
- Take a jump, Jack.

833
01:01:50,149 --> 01:01:52,817
He doesn't have to admit it.
Here's his gun.

834
01:01:52,818 --> 01:01:54,269
Come on.

835
01:01:56,855 --> 01:01:59,723
You too, Phil.
The DA is waiting for us.

836
01:01:59,724 --> 01:02:02,627
On the way, you and I
can have a little talk.

837
01:02:09,033 --> 01:02:11,733
The DA isn't going
to like this very much.

838
01:02:11,734 --> 01:02:13,402
Yeah, I know.

839
01:02:13,403 --> 01:02:15,370
Cronjager'll be there too.

840
01:02:15,371 --> 01:02:17,124
That won't help.

841
01:02:17,273 --> 01:02:20,875
Maybe I can needle him enough
to take the heat off you.

842
01:02:20,876 --> 01:02:22,629
Appreciate it.

843
01:02:23,612 --> 01:02:24,762
Thanks.

844
01:02:33,588 --> 01:02:35,989
- Evening, Mr. Wilde.
- Hi, Marlowe.

845
01:02:35,990 --> 01:02:37,591
Hi, Cronjager.

846
01:02:37,592 --> 01:02:39,458
- You know Marlowe?
- I know him.

847
01:02:39,459 --> 01:02:42,127
Sit down. Unless
you'd rather be on your feet.

848
01:02:42,128 --> 01:02:43,345
You'd better start.

849
01:02:43,630 --> 01:02:46,098
I guess the best way to begin is...

850
01:02:46,099 --> 01:02:49,578
...to ask Cronjager what he's got
on the Randall Place killing.

851
01:02:50,236 --> 01:02:51,648
Brody was the name.

852
01:02:51,871 --> 01:02:55,473
We got Brody with two slugs in him,
two guns that hadn't been fired...

853
01:02:55,474 --> 01:02:58,475
...a dame trying to start a car
that didn't belong to her.

854
01:02:58,476 --> 01:03:00,577
Hers was next to it.
The same model.

855
01:03:00,578 --> 01:03:03,914
She acted rattled.
We brought her in and she talked.

856
01:03:03,915 --> 01:03:06,849
- She didn't see the killer...
- That's all you got?

857
01:03:06,850 --> 01:03:08,885
- It only happened an hour ago.
- I know.

858
01:03:08,886 --> 01:03:11,654
- You expect the movie of the killing?
- Not from you.

859
01:03:11,655 --> 01:03:14,590
That'll do.
Go ahead, Bernie.

860
01:03:14,591 --> 01:03:18,227
Your killer's down below, handcuffed.
Here's the gun he used.

861
01:03:19,228 --> 01:03:21,363
- Marlowe got him for you.
- How...?

862
01:03:21,364 --> 01:03:24,298
Oh, yeah, there are a couple
more deaths involved.

863
01:03:24,299 --> 01:03:27,368
One of them in your territory.
Maybe you know about it.

864
01:03:27,369 --> 01:03:29,703
- Marlowe uncovered them too.
- Keep going.

865
01:03:29,704 --> 01:03:33,740
And the car that was lifted out
of the ocean with a dead guy in it.

866
01:03:33,741 --> 01:03:34,891
What about it?

867
01:03:34,942 --> 01:03:38,978
The guy was chauffeur to a rich family
that was being blackmailed.

868
01:03:38,979 --> 01:03:42,015
Mr. Wilde recommended Marlowe
to the family through me.

869
01:03:42,016 --> 01:03:44,200
He'd been playing it
close to the vest.

870
01:03:44,250 --> 01:03:47,010
I love private dicks who do that.

871
01:03:47,186 --> 01:03:49,454
And you don't have
to be so coy about it.

872
01:03:49,455 --> 01:03:51,490
I don't have to be coy.

873
01:03:51,491 --> 01:03:53,624
I don't often get to be coy with you.

874
01:03:53,625 --> 01:03:55,826
I dig up stuff
your men don't see.

875
01:03:55,827 --> 01:03:57,962
- My men don't...
- That's enough.

876
01:03:57,963 --> 01:04:01,331
Sit down, captain.
And you, Bernie, go on with it.

877
01:04:01,332 --> 01:04:04,634
Well, this chauffeur
killed a guy last night.

878
01:04:04,635 --> 01:04:06,636
A guy named Geiger.

879
01:04:06,637 --> 01:04:09,639
He ran a racket, back of
a bookstore on Hollywood Blvd.

880
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:11,607
In your territory.

881
01:04:11,608 --> 01:04:15,624
But you hadn't heard about Geiger,
had you? Or the racket.

882
01:04:16,212 --> 01:04:18,414
Marlowe, tell it to them.

883
01:04:18,415 --> 01:04:20,248
- Well...
- I hadn't heard...

884
01:04:20,249 --> 01:04:21,816
- You want to talk?
- Go ahead.

885
01:04:21,817 --> 01:04:23,618
You'd better get this down.

886
01:04:23,619 --> 01:04:26,484
Yesterday, General Sternwood
showed me a letter...

887
01:04:26,755 --> 01:04:29,923
Brody stalled, but when Agnes
didn't back him up...

888
01:04:29,924 --> 01:04:32,159
...he began to get cold feet.

889
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:35,495
While I was persuading Brody to talk,
the doorbell rang.

890
01:04:35,496 --> 01:04:40,032
He opened it and somebody shot him.
Well, you know the rest.

891
01:04:40,033 --> 01:04:43,903
Outside of Taylor, Lundgren and Brody,
nobody knew about Geiger.

892
01:04:43,904 --> 01:04:46,010
His secretary.
She got it from Brody.

893
01:04:46,106 --> 01:04:48,039
No one else was near the house?

894
01:04:48,040 --> 01:04:52,043
So all you failed to do was report
a murder that happened last night?

895
01:04:52,044 --> 01:04:55,779
You fooled around all day so he
could commit a second killing today.

896
01:04:55,780 --> 01:04:58,549
That's all?
I was in a tough spot. I was wrong.

897
01:04:58,550 --> 01:05:02,686
But I wanted to protect my client.
I didn't know he'd gun for Brody.

898
01:05:02,687 --> 01:05:03,787
Just worked out that way.

899
01:05:03,788 --> 01:05:06,623
That's police business.
You're still in a tough spot.

900
01:05:06,624 --> 01:05:08,291
Have you told it complete?

901
01:05:08,292 --> 01:05:11,995
I left out personal details and
intend to keep on leaving them out.

902
01:05:11,996 --> 01:05:14,396
- Why?
- My client's entitled to protection.

903
01:05:14,397 --> 01:05:17,132
You think.
I got another idea.

904
01:05:17,133 --> 01:05:18,867
You could lose your license.

905
01:05:18,868 --> 01:05:23,204
Your division's got two murders,
both solved, with both killers.

906
01:05:23,205 --> 01:05:25,706
I don't see what you can gain
by starting trouble.

907
01:05:25,707 --> 01:05:27,775
Besides, there are
other people in this.

908
01:05:27,776 --> 01:05:30,144
What you bring out
wouldn't do any good.

909
01:05:30,445 --> 01:05:34,199
If Marlowe wants to forget it,
your office can take the credit.

910
01:05:34,782 --> 01:05:36,650
I hate to let him get away with it.

911
01:05:36,651 --> 01:05:41,440
Besides, it won't do you any good
by watching this over in the papers.

912
01:05:43,523 --> 01:05:46,825
- What do you want?
- I've got a prisoner to turn over.

913
01:05:46,826 --> 01:05:48,540
So long, Wilde.

914
01:05:55,034 --> 01:05:56,485
Eddie, you can go.

915
01:05:56,502 --> 01:05:59,563
Just a minute.
Leave that notebook here.

916
01:06:04,409 --> 01:06:07,744
You'll have to make another
statement for our files.

917
01:06:07,745 --> 01:06:10,546
You think we can keep
the two killings separate...

918
01:06:10,547 --> 01:06:13,032
...and keep Sternwood's
name out of it?

919
01:06:13,517 --> 01:06:15,584
Yeah, I think so.

920
01:06:15,652 --> 01:06:18,520
Know why I'm doing this
instead of tearing your ear off?

921
01:06:18,521 --> 01:06:22,393
- I expected to lose both of them.
- You should have.

922
01:06:22,491 --> 01:06:25,860
- What are you getting for all this?
- $ 25 a day and expenses.

923
01:06:25,861 --> 01:06:29,363
- That's $50 and a little gasoline.
- About that.

924
01:06:29,364 --> 01:06:32,833
For that, you're willing
to get in touch with the law...

925
01:06:32,834 --> 01:06:34,768
...and lose your license?

926
01:06:34,769 --> 01:06:37,411
I don't like it, but I'm on a case.

927
01:06:37,471 --> 01:06:40,973
Just what did General Sternwood
really want you for?

928
01:06:40,974 --> 01:06:43,142
To settle this business with Geiger.

929
01:06:43,143 --> 01:06:48,146
Are you sure it didn't have anything
to do with that ex-bootlegger Regan?

930
01:06:48,147 --> 01:06:49,403
What makes you say that?

931
01:06:49,449 --> 01:06:53,518
I had an idea that he thought
Regan was mixed up in this.

932
01:06:53,519 --> 01:06:56,921
And he really wanted you
to find out that Regan isn't.

933
01:06:56,922 --> 01:06:59,323
Shawn's no blackmailer.
I know him.

934
01:06:59,324 --> 01:07:01,391
You'd better find him and make sure.

935
01:07:01,426 --> 01:07:02,721
Maybe I had.

936
01:07:02,761 --> 01:07:05,361
- And buy Bernie a box of cigars.
- I'll do that.

937
01:07:05,362 --> 01:07:09,165
- He's earned it.
- Someday, Cronjager'll blow up and bust.

938
01:07:09,166 --> 01:07:11,770
- So long, Mr. Wilde.
- So long.

939
01:07:18,541 --> 01:07:19,575
Thanks, Bernie.

940
01:07:19,576 --> 01:07:22,610
Forget it.
Cronjager's always been my pigeon.

941
01:07:22,611 --> 01:07:23,906
What happens now?

942
01:07:23,946 --> 01:07:25,747
Looks like I'll get paid off.

943
01:07:25,748 --> 01:07:27,515
That'll end it, huh?

944
01:07:27,516 --> 01:07:29,183
I don't know, Bernie.

945
01:07:29,184 --> 01:07:31,151
This began as a case of blackmail.

946
01:07:31,152 --> 01:07:33,954
All at once, things started
to happen for no reason.

947
01:07:33,955 --> 01:07:35,982
No reason at all.

948
01:07:37,592 --> 01:07:40,259
- Now it's over...
- You think there's more.

949
01:07:40,260 --> 01:07:41,594
Well, so do you.

950
01:07:41,628 --> 01:07:43,963
What's your dope
on Regan's disappearance?

951
01:07:43,964 --> 01:07:47,933
Missing Persons has all we've got.
It boils down to one thing:

952
01:07:47,934 --> 01:07:52,342
Eddie Mars' blonde wife disappeared
the same time Regan did.

953
01:07:53,672 --> 01:07:55,962
Mars ever ask you to find her?

954
01:07:56,642 --> 01:08:00,010
Could be people want us
to think they ran off together.

955
01:08:00,011 --> 01:08:01,645
Is that just a hunch?

956
01:08:01,646 --> 01:08:02,902
Almost.

957
01:08:03,681 --> 01:08:05,212
Why don't you play it?

958
01:08:05,216 --> 01:08:08,433
That's what the DA said.
I think I will.

959
01:08:14,992 --> 01:08:17,259
- Well!
- Good morning.

960
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:18,791
And how are you today?

961
01:08:18,795 --> 01:08:21,085
Better than last night.

962
01:08:21,330 --> 01:08:22,978
Come on in.

963
01:08:27,469 --> 01:08:29,336
No answer on your telephone.

964
01:08:29,337 --> 01:08:31,325
It was unplugged.

965
01:08:31,573 --> 01:08:34,608
I wanted to get some sleep.
I was tired.

966
01:08:34,609 --> 01:08:38,278
I was worried and wanted to know
what happened after I left.

967
01:08:38,279 --> 01:08:40,380
Worried or curious?

968
01:08:40,381 --> 01:08:43,082
Both.
Then I read the morning papers.

969
01:08:43,083 --> 01:08:46,618
We were lucky. We managed to keep
the Sternwoods out of it.

970
01:08:46,619 --> 01:08:49,354
My father and I were
both very pleased.

971
01:08:49,355 --> 01:08:51,790
He hopes you didn't involve
yourself too deeply.

972
01:08:51,791 --> 01:08:53,457
You tell him you were there?

973
01:08:53,458 --> 01:08:55,660
Nothing would be gained
by telling him.

974
01:08:55,661 --> 01:08:59,913
You're probably right. Anything
special you wanted to see me about?

975
01:09:00,766 --> 01:09:05,135
Dad asked me to give you a check.
He considers the case closed.

976
01:09:05,136 --> 01:09:06,587
It is, isn't it?

977
01:09:06,604 --> 01:09:08,638
Well, as regards Geiger, yes.

978
01:09:08,639 --> 01:09:13,505
Then it's completely closed.
I hope this is satisfactory.

979
01:09:14,311 --> 01:09:15,684
Five hundred!

980
01:09:15,712 --> 01:09:19,728
It's a lot more than I expected,
but welcome just the same.

981
01:09:21,116 --> 01:09:22,217
Here you are.

982
01:09:22,218 --> 01:09:25,486
Here's the three promissory notes
and Geiger's card.

983
01:09:25,487 --> 01:09:29,090
As for the photographs, I'll destroy
them myself, if you don't mind.

984
01:09:29,091 --> 01:09:31,291
We appreciate what you've done.

985
01:09:31,292 --> 01:09:33,627
Someday, my father wants
to thank you himself.

986
01:09:33,628 --> 01:09:36,129
Fine, I'll come and
drink more of his brandy.

987
01:09:36,130 --> 01:09:39,347
Maybe he'd talk some more
about Shawn Regan.

988
01:09:40,767 --> 01:09:42,635
My brandy's just as good.

989
01:09:42,636 --> 01:09:45,204
If you can stop being
a detective long enough...

990
01:09:45,205 --> 01:09:46,806
...to have a drink with me.

991
01:09:46,807 --> 01:09:48,874
I'd like to. I like brandy.

992
01:09:48,875 --> 01:09:50,746
I have lots of it.

993
01:10:07,358 --> 01:10:09,923
"Completely closed".

994
01:10:18,668 --> 01:10:20,869
<i>- Long distance.
- Hello, long distance?</i>

995
01:10:20,870 --> 01:10:24,350
This is Philip Marlowe at Main 9-1494.

996
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:27,575
<i>Hello? I have Mr. Mars for you.</i>

997
01:10:27,576 --> 01:10:29,800
Thanks. Put him on.

998
01:10:30,746 --> 01:10:32,617
Hello, Mr. Mars?

999
01:10:32,981 --> 01:10:35,348
Hello, Eddie.
This is Phil Marlowe.

1000
01:10:35,349 --> 01:10:38,285
<i>- I called because I want to see you.
- Sure. When?</i>

1001
01:10:38,286 --> 01:10:42,577
<i>- I could drive up tonight.
- Okay, come ahead.</i>

1002
01:10:58,203 --> 01:10:59,890
Good evening.

1003
01:11:03,541 --> 01:11:06,276
Mr. Mars around? I'm Marlowe.
He's expecting me.

1004
01:11:06,277 --> 01:11:09,115
Wait here and I'll find out.

1005
01:11:13,951 --> 01:11:18,242
<i>He would spend it on the ponies</i>

1006
01:11:18,288 --> 01:11:22,264
<i>He would spend it on the girls</i>

1007
01:11:22,425 --> 01:11:26,795
<i>Buy his mother lovely roses</i>

1008
01:11:26,796 --> 01:11:31,348
<i>For her dear old hennaed curls</i>

1009
01:11:31,866 --> 01:11:35,843
<i>But when his wife said, "Sweetie...</i>

1010
01:11:35,971 --> 01:11:41,072
<i>... what did you get for me?"</i>

1011
01:11:41,208 --> 01:11:46,036
<i>He socked her in the choppers</i>

1012
01:11:46,413 --> 01:11:49,848
<i>Such a sweet, sweet guy was he</i>

1013
01:11:49,849 --> 01:11:54,219
<i>And her tears flowed like wine</i>

1014
01:11:57,189 --> 01:12:00,992
<i>She's a real sad tomato</i>

1015
01:12:00,993 --> 01:12:04,054
<i>She's a busted valentine</i>

1016
01:12:04,096 --> 01:12:08,298
<i>Knows her mama done told her</i>

1017
01:12:08,299 --> 01:12:11,601
<i>That a man is darned unkind</i>

1018
01:12:11,602 --> 01:12:14,467
<i>I'm a telling you, mister</i>

1019
01:12:15,205 --> 01:12:18,149
<i>She was a sob, sob sister</i>

1020
01:12:19,109 --> 01:12:20,909
<i>Lying on a pillow</i>

1021
01:12:20,910 --> 01:12:22,127
<i>Weeping like a willow</i>

1022
01:12:22,612 --> 01:12:26,588
<i>My, oh, my
How that baby could cry</i>

1023
01:12:27,983 --> 01:12:31,486
<i>And her tears flowed like wine</i>

1024
01:12:31,487 --> 01:12:35,934
<i>Yes, her tears flowed like wine</i>

1025
01:12:37,892 --> 01:12:41,987
- Hello, boys.
- Stop it. He's waiting to see you.

1026
01:12:46,867 --> 01:12:48,017
Thanks.

1027
01:12:50,770 --> 01:12:53,605
Glad you came.
You never been here before?

1028
01:12:53,606 --> 01:12:55,774
First time.
I wouldn't be here now...

1029
01:12:55,775 --> 01:12:59,778
...if you hadn't told me
I could come up here if I needed help.

1030
01:12:59,779 --> 01:13:01,151
Drink?

1031
01:13:05,817 --> 01:13:08,352
I like the way you've
handled this whole thing.

1032
01:13:08,353 --> 01:13:11,921
It made me sore at first, but I see
now you knew what you were doing.

1033
01:13:11,922 --> 01:13:14,067
You and I could get along.

1034
01:13:14,491 --> 01:13:17,160
I like to pay my bills as I go.

1035
01:13:17,161 --> 01:13:19,881
- How much do I owe you?
- For what?

1036
01:13:20,196 --> 01:13:22,106
Still careful, huh?

1037
01:13:22,865 --> 01:13:25,634
All right, then.
I want some information...

1038
01:13:25,635 --> 01:13:27,779
...about Shawn Regan.

1039
01:13:31,173 --> 01:13:33,908
You got it from
the Bureau of Missing Persons.

1040
01:13:33,909 --> 01:13:35,476
- You get around.
- My boys do.

1041
01:13:35,477 --> 01:13:37,410
- Where is he?
- I haven't any idea.

1042
01:13:37,411 --> 01:13:39,446
You didn't bump him off, did you?

1043
01:13:39,447 --> 01:13:41,281
No. You think I did?

1044
01:13:41,282 --> 01:13:43,767
- That's what I came to ask.
- You're kidding.

1045
01:13:43,818 --> 01:13:45,728
All right, I'm kidding.

1046
01:13:47,687 --> 01:13:51,520
You didn't do it and your boys
aren't good enough to. I knew Regan.

1047
01:13:52,158 --> 01:13:54,185
You said you weren't looking for Regan.

1048
01:13:54,194 --> 01:13:56,961
I wasn't then.
Maybe I just got curious.

1049
01:13:56,962 --> 01:13:59,997
I finally got it
that the general was worried...

1050
01:13:59,998 --> 01:14:02,700
...Regan might be mixed up
in this blackmail business.

1051
01:14:02,701 --> 01:14:05,202
Sternwood can turn over now
and go back to sleep.

1052
01:14:05,203 --> 01:14:09,376
It was Geiger's own racket.
I did some inquiring myself today.

1053
01:14:09,574 --> 01:14:12,309
When Geiger and Brody got gunned,
it finished it.

1054
01:14:12,310 --> 01:14:15,409
- That, I'm sure of.
- It's finished, then.

1055
01:14:17,647 --> 01:14:20,382
The general thinks like you do.
He paid me off today.

1056
01:14:20,383 --> 01:14:22,150
I'm sorry to hear that.

1057
01:14:22,151 --> 01:14:25,320
I wish he'd hire you to keep
that daughter of his home.

1058
01:14:25,321 --> 01:14:26,988
- She's there now.
- I heard her.

1059
01:14:26,989 --> 01:14:28,857
She's not very popular here.

1060
01:14:28,858 --> 01:14:31,959
When she loses, she doubles and
I get a fistful of paper.

1061
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:35,195
- If she wins, she takes my money.
- Don't you get it back?

1062
01:14:35,196 --> 01:14:38,465
- She spends it somewhere else.
- Oh, she goes on the cuff.

1063
01:14:38,466 --> 01:14:40,689
Keep her out of here, then.

1064
01:14:41,702 --> 01:14:44,737
- I took the trip for nothing.
- Sorry I can't help you.

1065
01:14:44,738 --> 01:14:46,739
You mind if I look
the place over?

1066
01:14:46,740 --> 01:14:49,142
Take that door,
it comes out behind the tables.

1067
01:14:49,143 --> 01:14:51,610
No, thanks. I'll go out
with the other suckers.

1068
01:14:51,611 --> 01:14:53,512
Maybe someday I can do
you a favor.

1069
01:14:53,513 --> 01:14:54,546
Maybe.

1070
01:14:54,547 --> 01:14:56,837
There's one thing that puzzles me.

1071
01:14:56,916 --> 01:14:59,898
You don't seem in a hurry
to find that wife of yours.

1072
01:14:59,951 --> 01:15:03,287
I hear she's not the kind of wife
a guy wants to lose.

1073
01:15:03,288 --> 01:15:06,790
Could it be you know where she is,
and maybe Regan too?

1074
01:15:06,791 --> 01:15:10,767
Stop being curious. What's between
me and my wife is between us.

1075
01:15:11,095 --> 01:15:12,351
Sorry.

1076
01:15:13,197 --> 01:15:16,533
Oh, Eddie, you don't have
anybody watching me, do you?

1077
01:15:16,534 --> 01:15:18,734
Tailing me in a gray Plymouth coupe?

1078
01:15:18,735 --> 01:15:19,768
No. Why should I?

1079
01:15:19,769 --> 01:15:23,505
I can't imagine, unless you're worried
about where I am all the time.

1080
01:15:23,506 --> 01:15:25,691
I don't like you that well.

1081
01:15:26,742 --> 01:15:28,312
So long, Eddie.

1082
01:15:34,850 --> 01:15:36,816
Mr. Marlowe?

1083
01:15:36,817 --> 01:15:38,923
- Mrs. Rut...
- Mrs. Rut...

1084
01:15:39,921 --> 01:15:40,954
You better take it.

1085
01:15:40,955 --> 01:15:43,823
Mrs. Rutledge wants to
see you before you go.

1086
01:15:43,824 --> 01:15:45,491
She's at the center table.

1087
01:15:45,492 --> 01:15:47,323
Thank you both.

1088
01:15:49,062 --> 01:15:50,863
Mr. Marlowe. Mrs. Rutle...

1089
01:15:50,864 --> 01:15:52,656
Mrs. Rutledge wants to see me.

1090
01:15:52,999 --> 01:15:54,799
- How did you know?
- He told me.

1091
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:58,002
She sure is picking them tonight.
Just won eight in a row.

1092
01:15:58,003 --> 01:16:01,483
- I didn't hear him tell you anything.
- He didn't.

1093
01:16:09,614 --> 01:16:12,682
What kind of game is this?
Go on. Spin the wheel.

1094
01:16:12,683 --> 01:16:13,783
I want another play.

1095
01:16:13,784 --> 01:16:16,152
I'm sorry. You have
more than $ 14,000 there.

1096
01:16:16,153 --> 01:16:17,853
The table cannot cover your bet.

1097
01:16:17,854 --> 01:16:19,555
Don't you want your money back?

1098
01:16:19,556 --> 01:16:20,706
I sent for Mr. Mars.

1099
01:16:20,757 --> 01:16:22,548
- Lady...
- Do you want to cover it?

1100
01:16:26,796 --> 01:16:27,862
The lady.

1101
01:16:27,863 --> 01:16:30,931
- Something the matter?
- I'd like one more play.

1102
01:16:30,932 --> 01:16:32,842
All this on the red.

1103
01:16:33,101 --> 01:16:34,972
Cover her bet in even thousands.

1104
01:16:35,036 --> 01:16:38,639
If no one objects to this turn of
the wheel being for the lady alone.

1105
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:40,540
Wish me luck, Marlowe.

1106
01:16:40,541 --> 01:16:42,342
You wanted to see me.

1107
01:16:42,343 --> 01:16:45,044
The people I came with want to stay...

1108
01:16:45,045 --> 01:16:47,981
...so I thought maybe
you'd like to drive me home.

1109
01:16:47,982 --> 01:16:50,249
- Sure.
- Are you ready, lady?

1110
01:16:50,250 --> 01:16:53,088
- Yeah, I'm ready.
- So am I.

1111
01:17:07,932 --> 01:17:09,227
Number five, red!

1112
01:17:14,438 --> 01:17:15,849
You did all right.

1113
01:17:15,872 --> 01:17:20,124
I'll get my car while you collect,
and meet you outside.

1114
01:17:21,411 --> 01:17:23,360
Cash me in.

1115
01:18:30,205 --> 01:18:31,958
Good night.

1116
01:18:51,925 --> 01:18:54,159
This is a gun, lady.
I want that money.

1117
01:18:54,160 --> 01:18:57,142
Yell and I'll cut you in half.
Give me that bag!

1118
01:18:59,698 --> 01:19:01,843
Hello, pal. Easy!

1119
01:19:02,501 --> 01:19:05,269
Somebody's always giving me guns.

1120
01:19:05,270 --> 01:19:06,720
You can turn around now.

1121
01:19:07,839 --> 01:19:12,968
I don't like people who play games.
Tell your boss...

1122
01:19:13,578 --> 01:19:15,264
...when you wake up.

1123
01:19:16,747 --> 01:19:18,042
Nice work.

1124
01:19:18,081 --> 01:19:19,782
Are you my bodyguard now?

1125
01:19:19,783 --> 01:19:21,117
Looks like it.

1126
01:19:21,151 --> 01:19:22,943
You ready to go?

1127
01:19:28,958 --> 01:19:32,227
Why are you trembling?
Don't tell me you were scared.

1128
01:19:32,228 --> 01:19:34,595
I'm not used to being hijacked.
Give me time.

1129
01:19:34,596 --> 01:19:37,064
Hijacked? Is that what it was?

1130
01:19:37,065 --> 01:19:38,674
What else?

1131
01:19:50,844 --> 01:19:53,111
You're still shaking.
What's the matter?

1132
01:19:53,112 --> 01:19:56,548
You weren't worried about me?
Afraid I'd get hurt?

1133
01:19:56,549 --> 01:19:59,532
When did you begin
to feel that way about me?

1134
01:20:02,354 --> 01:20:04,221
Why are we stopping?

1135
01:20:04,222 --> 01:20:06,328
To settle something.

1136
01:20:07,125 --> 01:20:08,537
All right...

1137
01:20:08,894 --> 01:20:11,261
...let's begin with
what Mars has on you.

1138
01:20:11,262 --> 01:20:13,763
If he had, would it
be any of your business?

1139
01:20:13,764 --> 01:20:15,365
You've already been paid.

1140
01:20:15,366 --> 01:20:16,739
Yeah, by you.

1141
01:20:16,767 --> 01:20:20,202
- Are you after more money?
- I guess you've got a right to ask.

1142
01:20:20,203 --> 01:20:24,834
No, I've already been well-paid.
I've got another reason.

1143
01:20:24,908 --> 01:20:27,237
You like my father, don't you?

1144
01:20:27,377 --> 01:20:28,526
Why don't you stop?

1145
01:20:28,844 --> 01:20:32,180
Remember I said I was beginning
to like another Sternwood?

1146
01:20:32,181 --> 01:20:34,287
I wish you'd show it.

1147
01:20:34,349 --> 01:20:36,795
That should be awful easy.

1148
01:20:44,859 --> 01:20:46,571
I liked that.

1149
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:48,510
I'd like more.

1150
01:20:54,967 --> 01:20:56,955
That's even better.

1151
01:20:58,037 --> 01:20:59,332
All right.

1152
01:20:59,371 --> 01:21:03,008
Now that's settled.
What's Eddie Mars got on you?

1153
01:21:04,342 --> 01:21:06,677
- So that's the way it is.
- That's the way it is.

1154
01:21:06,678 --> 01:21:09,346
Kissing you is all right.
I'd like to do more of it.

1155
01:21:09,347 --> 01:21:11,648
But I want to find out
what Mars has on you.

1156
01:21:11,649 --> 01:21:14,584
- If you say that again...
- I'll keep saying it till I find out.

1157
01:21:14,585 --> 01:21:17,253
I told Eddie Mars
I was coming up to see him.

1158
01:21:17,254 --> 01:21:19,021
When I arrived, you were there.

1159
01:21:19,022 --> 01:21:21,390
You two staged an act.
He let you win money...

1160
01:21:21,391 --> 01:21:23,558
...and then sent a man
to take it away...

1161
01:21:23,559 --> 01:21:26,358
...to prove there was
nothing between you.

1162
01:21:26,863 --> 01:21:28,013
You're shaking again.

1163
01:21:28,197 --> 01:21:31,032
- Take me home.
- Sure I will.

1164
01:21:31,033 --> 01:21:32,766
But first, open that bag.

1165
01:21:32,767 --> 01:21:36,036
If there's 28 grand in it,
I'll eat every word I've said.

1166
01:21:36,037 --> 01:21:39,173
Make a sap out of me,
or else stop playing me for one.

1167
01:21:39,174 --> 01:21:41,207
Take me home.

1168
01:21:41,208 --> 01:21:43,743
All right, but that's as far
as I'll carry you.

1169
01:21:43,744 --> 01:21:46,609
From now on, you can
take care of yourself.

1170
01:21:56,823 --> 01:21:58,235
<i>Hello, Phil?</i>

1171
01:21:58,258 --> 01:22:01,826
<i>- Hello, Bernie. What's up?
- I want to see you right away.</i>

1172
01:22:01,827 --> 01:22:03,694
I haven't had breakfast.

1173
01:22:03,695 --> 01:22:05,396
<i>It's 2:00.</i>

1174
01:22:05,397 --> 01:22:08,832
<i>If you're not here in 30 minutes
you'll be eating on the county.</i>

1175
01:22:08,833 --> 01:22:13,069
I'd rather buy my own.
I know that food the county puts out.

1176
01:22:13,070 --> 01:22:15,137
All right, I'll be there.

1177
01:22:23,513 --> 01:22:26,548
Don't you know better than to wake
a man at 2 p.m.?

1178
01:22:26,549 --> 01:22:28,694
- What's up?
- I got some orders for you.

1179
01:22:28,717 --> 01:22:30,919
You're to lay off the Sternwood case.

1180
01:22:30,920 --> 01:22:33,187
- Who says so?
- The DA.

1181
01:22:33,188 --> 01:22:35,098
The DA, huh?

1182
01:22:37,158 --> 01:22:39,448
He must have changed his mind.

1183
01:22:40,395 --> 01:22:42,863
- Who changed it for him?
- General Sternwood.

1184
01:22:42,864 --> 01:22:44,498
Personally?

1185
01:22:44,499 --> 01:22:47,867
All right. Between you and me,
he didn't talk to the general.

1186
01:22:47,868 --> 01:22:50,772
He talked to the daughter,
Mrs. Rutledge.

1187
01:22:51,605 --> 01:22:54,372
- Any reason given?
- Not that I know of.

1188
01:22:54,373 --> 01:22:57,842
There's no law says a man can't
work on a case without a client.

1189
01:22:57,843 --> 01:22:59,060
Keep his hand in.

1190
01:22:59,111 --> 01:23:01,479
I'm just supposed to
tell you to lay off.

1191
01:23:01,480 --> 01:23:03,714
I know, you just work here.

1192
01:23:03,715 --> 01:23:07,129
All right, you told me to lay off.

1193
01:23:07,152 --> 01:23:09,353
I'm getting breakfast.
Want a cup of coffee?

1194
01:23:09,354 --> 01:23:10,885
No, thanks.

1195
01:23:43,784 --> 01:23:47,287
<i>- Sternwood residence.
- Hello, Norris? This is Marlowe.</i>

1196
01:23:47,288 --> 01:23:48,544
<i>Yes, Mr. Marlowe. I...</i>

1197
01:23:48,588 --> 01:23:51,256
I'd like to come out
and see General Sternwood.

1198
01:23:51,257 --> 01:23:53,626
<i>I don't think it
would be possible tonight.</i>

1199
01:23:53,627 --> 01:23:56,495
<i>- Why not?
- I've been trying to call you.</i>

1200
01:23:56,496 --> 01:23:59,297
<i>Mrs. Rutledge is very anxious
to talk to you.</i>

1201
01:23:59,298 --> 01:24:02,556
<i>If you'll wait just a minute,
I'll put her on.</i>

1202
01:24:04,103 --> 01:24:05,837
Hey, sugar, you got a match?

1203
01:24:05,838 --> 01:24:07,524
Sure thing.

1204
01:24:08,840 --> 01:24:10,946
<i>Hello, Marlowe?</i>

1205
01:24:12,076 --> 01:24:13,449
Thanks.

1206
01:24:16,013 --> 01:24:17,613
Hello, Mrs. Rutledge.

1207
01:24:17,614 --> 01:24:21,050
<i>I wanted to tell you
you can stop worrying...</i>

1208
01:24:21,051 --> 01:24:23,819
<i>... and call off your bloodhounds.
We found Shawn.</i>

1209
01:24:23,820 --> 01:24:25,310
You found Shawn?

1210
01:24:25,321 --> 01:24:28,356
<i>Yes. He's been in Mexico.
He hasn't been very well.</i>

1211
01:24:28,357 --> 01:24:29,574
What happened?

1212
01:24:29,625 --> 01:24:32,694
<i>An accident of some kind.
We didn't get all the details.</i>

1213
01:24:32,695 --> 01:24:34,528
<i>I'm leaving at once to meet him.</i>

1214
01:24:34,529 --> 01:24:35,980
I see.

1215
01:24:35,997 --> 01:24:38,899
I suppose the general's quite pleased.

1216
01:24:38,900 --> 01:24:41,802
<i>We haven't told him yet.
We thought it best to wait.</i>

1217
01:24:41,803 --> 01:24:44,070
Thanks for telling me.

1218
01:24:44,071 --> 01:24:45,366
Have a nice trip.

1219
01:24:45,406 --> 01:24:47,591
<i>I will. Goodbye.</i>

1220
01:24:47,608 --> 01:24:49,139
Goodbye.

1221
01:25:23,073 --> 01:25:24,407
Say, mister...

1222
01:25:24,607 --> 01:25:25,757
...would you please...

1223
01:25:39,120 --> 01:25:42,260
This is just our way
of saying, "Lay off".

1224
01:26:14,918 --> 01:26:17,019
You the guy that's been tailing me?

1225
01:26:17,020 --> 01:26:19,789
Yeah. My name's Jones.
Harry Jones.

1226
01:26:19,790 --> 01:26:22,773
- I want to see you.
- Swell!

1227
01:26:23,494 --> 01:26:25,627
Did you want to see
those guys jump me?

1228
01:26:25,628 --> 01:26:28,113
I didn't care one way or the other.

1229
01:26:29,065 --> 01:26:31,099
You could've yelled for help.

1230
01:26:31,100 --> 01:26:35,350
A guy's playing a hand, I let him
play it. I'm no kibitzer.

1231
01:26:35,971 --> 01:26:38,077
You got brains.

1232
01:26:38,140 --> 01:26:40,403
Get my hat, will you?

1233
01:26:42,110 --> 01:26:44,516
Help me up to my office.

1234
01:27:01,527 --> 01:27:04,595
That working-over they gave you
was the best I've seen.

1235
01:27:04,596 --> 01:27:06,545
And I've been around too.

1236
01:27:06,732 --> 01:27:08,566
Used to run a little liquor.

1237
01:27:08,567 --> 01:27:11,301
Rode the scout car
with a Tommy gun in my lap.

1238
01:27:11,302 --> 01:27:13,565
- Tough racket.
- Terrible!

1239
01:27:13,905 --> 01:27:17,808
- Sit down. You make me nervous.
- Maybe you don't believe me.

1240
01:27:17,809 --> 01:27:19,259
What do you want?

1241
01:27:19,276 --> 01:27:20,649
That's better.

1242
01:27:20,677 --> 01:27:22,208
I'm selling something, cheap.

1243
01:27:22,379 --> 01:27:23,713
For a couple of C's.

1244
01:27:23,747 --> 01:27:25,539
Don't let me stop you.

1245
01:27:25,549 --> 01:27:29,106
- Don't you want to even know who I am?
- I already know.

1246
01:27:29,318 --> 01:27:30,351
You're not a cop.

1247
01:27:30,352 --> 01:27:33,054
You don't belong to Eddie Mars,
because I asked him.

1248
01:27:33,055 --> 01:27:35,490
So you must be one of Brody's friends.

1249
01:27:35,491 --> 01:27:37,491
So Agnes is loose again, huh?

1250
01:27:37,492 --> 01:27:39,293
How'd you know that?

1251
01:27:39,294 --> 01:27:42,663
She's a nice girl.
We're talking about getting married.

1252
01:27:42,664 --> 01:27:44,231
She's too big for you.

1253
01:27:44,232 --> 01:27:46,560
That's a dirty crack, brother.

1254
01:27:46,867 --> 01:27:49,012
I suppose you're right.

1255
01:27:51,805 --> 01:27:54,945
Maybe I've been running around
with the wrong people.

1256
01:27:55,209 --> 01:27:56,778
Cut the babble.
What is it?

1257
01:27:57,009 --> 01:27:58,910
Will you pay for something?

1258
01:27:58,911 --> 01:28:00,782
- If it what?
- Helps you find Regan.

1259
01:28:02,048 --> 01:28:03,198
This is getting funny.

1260
01:28:03,249 --> 01:28:07,017
I'm supposed to pay you two C's
for telling me I'm looking for Regan.

1261
01:28:07,018 --> 01:28:08,986
People are always
telling me that.

1262
01:28:08,987 --> 01:28:11,093
I don't even pass out cigars anymore.

1263
01:28:11,256 --> 01:28:13,123
Do you want to know what I've got?

1264
01:28:13,124 --> 01:28:14,654
I don't know.

1265
01:28:14,658 --> 01:28:17,961
200 buys a lot of
information in my circle.

1266
01:28:17,962 --> 01:28:20,430
Would you pay it to know
where Mars' wife is?

1267
01:28:20,431 --> 01:28:23,232
Would you pay $ 200 for that, shamus?

1268
01:28:23,233 --> 01:28:25,025
I think I might.

1269
01:28:25,034 --> 01:28:26,721
- Where?
- Agnes found her.

1270
01:28:27,070 --> 01:28:30,539
She'll tell you when she has
the dough in her hand.

1271
01:28:30,540 --> 01:28:34,375
- You might tell the cops for nothing.
- I ain't so brittle.

1272
01:28:34,376 --> 01:28:36,364
Agnes must have something
I didn't see.

1273
01:28:36,578 --> 01:28:38,446
I ain't tried to pull anything.

1274
01:28:38,447 --> 01:28:41,381
I came here with a proposition.
Take it or leave it.

1275
01:28:41,382 --> 01:28:43,316
One right guy to another.

1276
01:28:43,317 --> 01:28:47,354
You start waving cops at me.
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

1277
01:28:47,355 --> 01:28:48,689
I am.

1278
01:28:48,789 --> 01:28:50,123
Okay, 200 it is.

1279
01:28:50,423 --> 01:28:52,391
- Have you got the money?
- Where's Agnes?

1280
01:28:52,392 --> 01:28:55,094
You know Puss Walgreen's office?
Fulwider Building?

1281
01:28:55,095 --> 01:28:56,862
428 in the back?

1282
01:28:56,863 --> 01:28:58,664
No, but I can find it.

1283
01:28:58,665 --> 01:29:00,765
Can you meet me there
in an hour?

1284
01:29:00,766 --> 01:29:02,734
- I guess so.
- You bring the dough.

1285
01:29:02,735 --> 01:29:04,762
I'll take you to Agnes.

1286
01:29:48,409 --> 01:29:51,208
Who are you?
What do you want?

1287
01:29:56,082 --> 01:29:58,109
I wanted to see you.

1288
01:30:00,787 --> 01:30:01,920
Who are you?

1289
01:30:01,921 --> 01:30:05,022
I work for Eddie Mars.
My name is Canino.

1290
01:30:05,023 --> 01:30:06,593
Canino?

1291
01:30:07,926 --> 01:30:11,162
Sure, I thought you would remember.

1292
01:30:11,163 --> 01:30:12,196
What do you want?

1293
01:30:12,197 --> 01:30:14,664
Why have you been following Marlowe?

1294
01:30:14,665 --> 01:30:16,116
- Who says I've been?
- I do.

1295
01:30:16,133 --> 01:30:19,936
That was a mistake, your mistake.
Eddie Mars don't like it.

1296
01:30:19,937 --> 01:30:23,906
Sit down and quit stalling!
Why are you tailing Marlowe?

1297
01:30:23,907 --> 01:30:27,443
All right, there's no harm telling.
It was for Joe Brody's girl.

1298
01:30:27,444 --> 01:30:29,645
She has to leave town.
That takes dough.

1299
01:30:29,646 --> 01:30:31,379
She tried to
get it through Marlowe.

1300
01:30:31,380 --> 01:30:33,081
Why would he pay?

1301
01:30:33,082 --> 01:30:35,616
You know about the night
the kid bumped Brody?

1302
01:30:35,617 --> 01:30:37,885
The young Sternwood girl was there.

1303
01:30:37,886 --> 01:30:39,573
But Marlowe didn't say that.

1304
01:30:40,588 --> 01:30:43,423
Agnes figured it was carfare
when she got hold of him.

1305
01:30:43,424 --> 01:30:45,325
- You get it?
- Sure, I get it.

1306
01:30:45,326 --> 01:30:47,589
- Where's this Agnes?
- What do you care?

1307
01:30:47,628 --> 01:30:49,829
What do you want with her?
What's she got...

1308
01:30:49,830 --> 01:30:51,164
What's the matter, Jones?

1309
01:30:51,198 --> 01:30:53,997
Ain't you ever seen a gun?
Where's the girl?

1310
01:30:54,368 --> 01:30:57,069
You want me to count three,
like a movie?

1311
01:30:57,070 --> 01:30:58,782
Where's Agnes?

1312
01:31:00,206 --> 01:31:01,618
You win.

1313
01:31:01,640 --> 01:31:03,375
She's in an apartment...

1314
01:31:03,376 --> 01:31:05,482
...at 28 Court Street.

1315
01:31:06,679 --> 01:31:08,666
Apartment 301.

1316
01:31:09,714 --> 01:31:10,864
I guess I'm yellow.

1317
01:31:11,082 --> 01:31:13,384
You just got good sense.

1318
01:31:13,385 --> 01:31:17,518
I ain't gonna hurt her.
Not if everything's like you say.

1319
01:31:17,788 --> 01:31:18,938
Nervous, ain't you?

1320
01:31:19,189 --> 01:31:21,858
- Maybe you need a drink.
- I don't think so...

1321
01:31:21,859 --> 01:31:23,730
You got a glass?

1322
01:31:26,162 --> 01:31:27,312
At the water cooler.

1323
01:31:42,377 --> 01:31:45,673
There you are, pal.
Drink her down.

1324
01:31:46,514 --> 01:31:47,664
Well, drink it!

1325
01:31:47,748 --> 01:31:50,016
What do you think it is, poison?

1326
01:31:50,017 --> 01:31:52,582
I bet that Agnes
wouldn't turn it down.

1327
01:31:53,119 --> 01:31:55,304
No, I'll bet she wouldn't.

1328
01:32:02,528 --> 01:32:04,215
What's funny?

1329
01:32:05,764 --> 01:32:07,556
Nothing's funny.

1330
01:32:08,801 --> 01:32:10,828
So long, Jonesy.

1331
01:32:44,899 --> 01:32:49,235
Information, give me the number
of apartment 301, 28 Court Street.

1332
01:32:49,236 --> 01:32:51,185
<i>Thank you. One moment, please.</i>

1333
01:32:52,739 --> 01:32:56,908
<i>- Courtview Apartments.
- This is Police Identification Bureau.</i>

1334
01:32:56,909 --> 01:32:59,778
You got a girl living there
named Agnes Lowzier?

1335
01:32:59,779 --> 01:33:01,913
<i>Nobody by that name here.</i>

1336
01:33:01,914 --> 01:33:04,716
Have you got a brunette with
green eyes...

1337
01:33:04,717 --> 01:33:08,686
...either alone or with a little guy,
weighs about 115 pounds...

1338
01:33:08,687 --> 01:33:10,921
...wears a gray hat and gray suit?

1339
01:33:10,922 --> 01:33:13,329
<i>Sorry. Nothing like that.</i>

1340
01:33:14,259 --> 01:33:17,293
Somebody just gave out
the wrong address.

1341
01:33:17,294 --> 01:33:18,745
Thanks.

1342
01:33:38,213 --> 01:33:40,856
You did all right, Jonesy.

1343
01:33:40,916 --> 01:33:43,714
But you left me high and dry.

1344
01:33:57,864 --> 01:33:58,998
<i>Who is this?</i>

1345
01:33:58,999 --> 01:34:01,900
<i>- What did you say?
- I said, "Who is this?"</i>

1346
01:34:01,901 --> 01:34:04,230
Hello, Agnes. This is Marlowe.

1347
01:34:04,336 --> 01:34:06,137
Marlowe, the man you want to see.

1348
01:34:06,138 --> 01:34:08,584
<i>Is Harry there?</i>

1349
01:34:08,941 --> 01:34:10,040
Yeah, he's here.

1350
01:34:10,041 --> 01:34:12,776
<i>- Put him on, will you?
- He can't talk to you.</i>

1351
01:34:12,777 --> 01:34:15,537
<i>- Why?
- Because he's dead.</i>

1352
01:34:15,680 --> 01:34:19,160
Your little man died to keep
you out of trouble.

1353
01:34:19,416 --> 01:34:21,484
I got your money for you.
Do you want it?

1354
01:34:21,485 --> 01:34:23,619
<i>- Yeah, I want it.
- Have you got a car?</i>

1355
01:34:23,620 --> 01:34:26,689
<i>- Where can I meet you?
- Rampart and Oakwood.</i>

1356
01:34:26,690 --> 01:34:29,057
I'll be there in half an hour.

1357
01:34:47,641 --> 01:34:49,668
What happened to Harry?

1358
01:34:49,743 --> 01:34:53,046
There's no use going into that.
You don't really care anyway.

1359
01:34:53,047 --> 01:34:56,081
Just put it down your little man
deserved something better.

1360
01:34:56,082 --> 01:34:57,455
Here's your 200.

1361
01:34:59,552 --> 01:35:02,888
Joe and I were riding on Foothill
Boulevard a couple of weeks ago.

1362
01:35:02,889 --> 01:35:05,723
We passed a brown coupe and
I saw the driver.

1363
01:35:05,724 --> 01:35:07,391
It was Eddie Mars' wife.

1364
01:35:07,392 --> 01:35:09,994
- There was a fellow with her. Canino.
- I know him.

1365
01:35:09,995 --> 01:35:13,297
<i>Some people you don't forget,
even if you've only seen them once.</i>

1366
01:35:13,298 --> 01:35:16,900
We got curious and Joe tailed them.
Do you know where Realito is?

1367
01:35:16,901 --> 01:35:19,469
About 10 miles east,
there's a side road.

1368
01:35:19,470 --> 01:35:22,072
Off the highway,
there's a garage and paint shop...

1369
01:35:22,073 --> 01:35:23,289
...run by a guy named Huck.

1370
01:35:23,340 --> 01:35:26,775
Hot-car drop, likely.
And a frame house right behind it.

1371
01:35:26,776 --> 01:35:28,346
That's where Mars' wife is.

1372
01:35:28,411 --> 01:35:30,412
- You sure of that?
- Why should I lie?

1373
01:35:30,413 --> 01:35:33,848
Art Huck's, 10 miles east of Realito.
Is that right?

1374
01:35:33,849 --> 01:35:36,718
So long, copper. Wish me luck.
I got a raw deal.

1375
01:35:36,719 --> 01:35:39,440
Your kind always does.

1376
01:37:45,433 --> 01:37:46,583
What do you want?

1377
01:37:46,601 --> 01:37:49,335
Open up.
I got a flat on the highway.

1378
01:37:49,336 --> 01:37:53,889
Sorry, mister, we're closed
for the night. Better try Realito.

1379
01:38:04,751 --> 01:38:06,282
All right.

1380
01:38:06,285 --> 01:38:08,115
Come on in.

1381
01:38:10,355 --> 01:38:12,556
You'd scare off
a lot of trade with that.

1382
01:38:12,557 --> 01:38:14,859
You can get yourself hurt
kicking on doors.

1383
01:38:14,860 --> 01:38:16,010
Cut it out, Art.

1384
01:38:16,128 --> 01:38:17,578
The guy's right.

1385
01:38:17,595 --> 01:38:22,345
You run a garage, don't you?
Go ahead. Give him a hand.

1386
01:38:23,100 --> 01:38:24,473
Thanks, mister.

1387
01:38:25,802 --> 01:38:27,703
I suppose you can fix flats?

1388
01:38:27,704 --> 01:38:31,140
Good as you can make them,
but I'm working on a spray job.

1389
01:38:31,141 --> 01:38:33,404
It's too damp
for a good spray job, Art.

1390
01:38:33,643 --> 01:38:35,343
You got time to fix his tire.

1391
01:38:35,344 --> 01:38:36,875
- But I don't...
- Get moving!

1392
01:38:37,513 --> 01:38:38,691
Sure.

1393
01:38:38,747 --> 01:38:40,615
Here's the key to the back.

1394
01:38:40,616 --> 01:38:43,337
Put the spare on.
That'll make it easier.

1395
01:38:47,822 --> 01:38:50,424
Yeah, I took a skid up at the corner.

1396
01:38:50,425 --> 01:38:54,527
A front tire went.
Lucky to find some help.

1397
01:38:54,528 --> 01:38:56,595
You live around here?

1398
01:38:56,863 --> 01:38:59,506
Just drove in from Reno
and Carson City.

1399
01:38:59,599 --> 01:39:02,895
Came the long way around, huh?
Business trip?

1400
01:39:03,169 --> 01:39:04,620
Partly.

1401
01:39:05,771 --> 01:39:07,505
Having your car painted?

1402
01:39:07,506 --> 01:39:09,240
Just a spray job.

1403
01:39:09,241 --> 01:39:12,654
Art's pretty slow.
He should've been finished by now.

1404
01:39:13,745 --> 01:39:15,393
All right, Art.

1405
01:39:15,413 --> 01:39:17,676
Take him in the house.

1406
01:39:35,031 --> 01:39:37,019
You'd be Mrs. Eddie Mars...

1407
01:39:37,500 --> 01:39:40,334
...the blonde that was
supposed to run off with Regan.

1408
01:39:40,335 --> 01:39:42,206
That's right.

1409
01:39:45,240 --> 01:39:46,888
Hello, angel.

1410
01:39:50,945 --> 01:39:54,425
Move that light, will you?
Or move me.

1411
01:39:59,786 --> 01:40:02,507
I thought I'd find you here.

1412
01:40:03,256 --> 01:40:05,691
I suppose we're in the house
back of the garage.

1413
01:40:05,692 --> 01:40:08,020
Maybe you'd better stop talking.

1414
01:40:10,929 --> 01:40:14,487
The boys don't take
any chances, do they?

1415
01:40:15,133 --> 01:40:16,702
Where are they?

1416
01:40:17,368 --> 01:40:19,369
Out digging a grave?

1417
01:40:19,370 --> 01:40:21,838
You had to go on
with this, didn't you?

1418
01:40:21,839 --> 01:40:22,989
Where are they?

1419
01:40:23,040 --> 01:40:25,574
They've gone down
the road to telephone.

1420
01:40:25,575 --> 01:40:29,252
Call up Eddie Mars,
find out what to do with me.

1421
01:40:29,279 --> 01:40:30,810
I could tell them that.

1422
01:40:30,814 --> 01:40:33,015
Why did you have to go on?

1423
01:40:33,016 --> 01:40:35,775
Too many people told me to stop.

1424
01:40:36,719 --> 01:40:38,987
Light me a cigarette,
will you, angel?

1425
01:40:38,988 --> 01:40:40,400
Why'd you make trouble?

1426
01:40:40,823 --> 01:40:42,490
Eddie never did you any harm.

1427
01:40:42,491 --> 01:40:45,025
I wasn't in love with Shawn.
We were friends.

1428
01:40:45,026 --> 01:40:47,027
If I hadn't hidden
when Shawn disappeared...

1429
01:40:47,028 --> 01:40:48,996
...the cops would've been sure
he killed him.

1430
01:40:48,997 --> 01:40:50,409
Maybe he did kill him.

1431
01:40:50,431 --> 01:40:51,726
Eddie's not that kind.

1432
01:40:51,766 --> 01:40:54,634
- You mean Eddie never kills anybody.
- No.

1433
01:40:54,635 --> 01:40:57,081
You really believe that, don't you?

1434
01:40:57,437 --> 01:41:00,206
How do you suppose
I found out you were here?

1435
01:41:00,207 --> 01:41:02,440
Little man named Jones told me.

1436
01:41:02,441 --> 01:41:04,876
Funny little guy. Harmless.
I liked him.

1437
01:41:04,877 --> 01:41:09,114
Came to sell me the information
because I was working for Sternwood.

1438
01:41:09,115 --> 01:41:11,782
How he came to know,
it's a long story.

1439
01:41:11,783 --> 01:41:14,385
Canino, your husband's man,
got to him first...

1440
01:41:14,386 --> 01:41:16,587
...while I stood around like a sap.

1441
01:41:16,588 --> 01:41:18,322
I was in the next room.

1442
01:41:18,323 --> 01:41:21,736
Now the little man is dead.
But Eddie didn't do that, did he?

1443
01:41:21,825 --> 01:41:24,427
He never kills anybody,
he just hires it done.

1444
01:41:24,428 --> 01:41:25,606
You're lying!

1445
01:41:25,663 --> 01:41:27,964
You think he's just
a gambler, don't you?

1446
01:41:27,965 --> 01:41:30,566
I think he's a blackmailer,
a hot-car broker...

1447
01:41:30,567 --> 01:41:32,176
...a killer by remote control.

1448
01:41:32,402 --> 01:41:36,118
Anything with money pinned to it,
anything rotten...

1449
01:41:38,674 --> 01:41:40,937
Ask him when you see him.

1450
01:41:43,345 --> 01:41:45,613
Well, we got rid of her.

1451
01:41:45,614 --> 01:41:47,447
She's all right.
I like her.

1452
01:41:47,448 --> 01:41:49,549
You like too many people.

1453
01:41:49,550 --> 01:41:53,687
- I wonder if you'd do that for a man.
- None that I've ever met.

1454
01:41:53,688 --> 01:41:57,056
Then there's nothing to do
but wait till Canino gets back.

1455
01:41:57,057 --> 01:41:58,958
He doesn't know
I was there.

1456
01:41:58,959 --> 01:42:01,824
You know what he'll do
when he finds out, don't you?

1457
01:42:01,828 --> 01:42:04,863
Beat my teeth out then kick me
in my stomach for mumbling.

1458
01:42:04,864 --> 01:42:07,532
- That'll be just the start...
- Stop talking that way!

1459
01:42:07,533 --> 01:42:09,634
You should have gone to Mexico.

1460
01:42:09,635 --> 01:42:12,203
- But then you couldn't, could you?
- Stop it.

1461
01:42:12,204 --> 01:42:14,838
Border patrol would have
checked you through alone.

1462
01:42:14,839 --> 01:42:17,107
People would have
seen you without Regan.

1463
01:42:17,108 --> 01:42:21,124
It was safer for you to come here,
especially for Eddie.

1464
01:42:21,446 --> 01:42:23,713
Will you stay out of this
if I let you go?

1465
01:42:23,714 --> 01:42:25,048
No.

1466
01:42:25,949 --> 01:42:27,780
Take this thing out of my mouth.

1467
01:42:43,765 --> 01:42:45,675
That's better.

1468
01:42:46,167 --> 01:42:47,959
Get a knife and cut these ropes.

1469
01:43:00,513 --> 01:43:02,044
Watch your fingers.

1470
01:43:07,620 --> 01:43:09,725
Don't cut toward your hand.

1471
01:43:13,125 --> 01:43:15,826
- Who's got a key to these handcuffs?
- Canino.

1472
01:43:15,827 --> 01:43:17,395
I don't suppose
there's a gun around?

1473
01:43:17,396 --> 01:43:19,461
None that I know of.

1474
01:43:29,205 --> 01:43:31,690
The boys made a fast trip.

1475
01:43:32,242 --> 01:43:33,929
What can you do?

1476
01:43:35,412 --> 01:43:38,479
Look, angel. I'm gonna
leave you in a tough spot.

1477
01:43:38,480 --> 01:43:39,514
That's all right.

1478
01:43:39,515 --> 01:43:42,350
- How do I get out of here?
- That door leads to a porch.

1479
01:43:42,351 --> 01:43:44,485
As soon as I've gone,
you count to 20.

1480
01:43:44,486 --> 01:43:46,395
- Then scream your head off.
- I will.

1481
01:43:47,355 --> 01:43:49,840
All right. Start counting.

1482
01:44:20,385 --> 01:44:23,027
Get going, Art.
You heard what I said!

1483
01:45:43,425 --> 01:45:45,412
There! Behind the wheel!

1484
01:45:47,762 --> 01:45:49,057
Over here, Canino!

1485
01:46:07,246 --> 01:46:08,424
Here.

1486
01:46:08,481 --> 01:46:10,744
That looks like the key.

1487
01:46:14,786 --> 01:46:17,115
We'll have to take his car.

1488
01:46:29,500 --> 01:46:32,401
How far is it from back there
to the nearest telephone?

1489
01:46:32,402 --> 01:46:34,926
About eight or 10 miles to Realito.
Why?

1490
01:46:35,071 --> 01:46:38,574
When Eddie's wife fixes my car
and he finds out what happened...

1491
01:46:38,575 --> 01:46:39,724
...there'll be trouble.

1492
01:46:39,942 --> 01:46:42,109
You'll be in it
just as much as I will.

1493
01:46:42,110 --> 01:46:44,216
I don't mind,
as long as you're around.

1494
01:46:46,415 --> 01:46:49,349
I didn't get a chance to thank you
for what you did.

1495
01:46:49,350 --> 01:46:51,142
You looked good. Awful good!

1496
01:46:51,552 --> 01:46:54,421
I didn't know they made them
like that anymore.

1497
01:46:54,422 --> 01:46:55,914
I guess I'm in love with you.

1498
01:46:59,292 --> 01:47:01,393
Will you go to the police with me?

1499
01:47:01,394 --> 01:47:02,728
I can't.

1500
01:47:02,762 --> 01:47:04,174
Why not?

1501
01:47:04,831 --> 01:47:07,532
What if I told you
I killed Shawn Regan?

1502
01:47:07,533 --> 01:47:09,678
Would you tell the police that?

1503
01:47:10,469 --> 01:47:12,732
I will if you take me there.

1504
01:47:14,540 --> 01:47:16,340
I'm not going to.

1505
01:47:16,341 --> 01:47:18,748
Look, angel, I'm tired.

1506
01:47:18,877 --> 01:47:21,612
My jaw hurts, my ribs ache,
I killed a man back there...

1507
01:47:21,613 --> 01:47:24,648
...and stood by while
a harmless guy was killed.

1508
01:47:24,649 --> 01:47:26,021
I can't say it all happened...

1509
01:47:26,049 --> 01:47:28,751
...because Geiger tried to throw
a loop over Carmen.

1510
01:47:28,752 --> 01:47:30,283
They'll swarm your house...

1511
01:47:30,287 --> 01:47:32,588
...so fast that every closet
in your family...

1512
01:47:32,589 --> 01:47:36,068
...will look like a police convention.

1513
01:47:36,325 --> 01:47:38,193
They'll all ask the same question...

1514
01:47:38,194 --> 01:47:39,725
..."Where's Shawn Regan?

1515
01:47:39,729 --> 01:47:42,731
Why did Mars hide his wife so
it looked like she ran off with Regan?"

1516
01:47:42,732 --> 01:47:46,200
Why did you hide out there?
You're playing with dynamite.

1517
01:47:46,201 --> 01:47:48,702
- If I...
- I won't ask any more questions.

1518
01:47:48,703 --> 01:47:51,505
I won't even ask you
how you got into this mess.

1519
01:47:51,506 --> 01:47:53,740
I'll ask Eddie,
if I can get there quickly.

1520
01:47:53,741 --> 01:47:55,768
Why are you doing that?

1521
01:47:56,210 --> 01:47:58,734
I guess I'm in love with you.

1522
01:48:41,684 --> 01:48:44,208
Hello. Let me talk to Mr. Mars.

1523
01:48:44,320 --> 01:48:47,760
Hello, Eddie.
This is Marlowe.

1524
01:48:48,022 --> 01:48:49,957
Yeah, Marlowe,
or what's left of him.

1525
01:48:49,958 --> 01:48:52,225
That Canino's a pretty good boy.

1526
01:48:52,226 --> 01:48:55,170
You'll have trouble getting
another as good.

1527
01:48:55,430 --> 01:48:57,953
What's the matter, Eddie?
Can't you talk?

1528
01:48:58,265 --> 01:49:00,967
I'm in Realito, the same
place Canino called from.

1529
01:49:00,968 --> 01:49:03,002
Only now it's me that's calling.

1530
01:49:03,003 --> 01:49:04,913
I want to see you.

1531
01:49:06,005 --> 01:49:09,741
Why don't you go to the police?
I just killed your best boy.

1532
01:49:09,742 --> 01:49:12,266
Do you want to see me
or don't you?

1533
01:49:12,745 --> 01:49:13,923
All right. Where?

1534
01:49:15,613 --> 01:49:19,368
Las Olindas is too far.
Not your apartment either.

1535
01:49:20,218 --> 01:49:21,368
Your house?

1536
01:49:21,519 --> 01:49:24,161
You mean the one
that Geiger lived in?

1537
01:49:24,822 --> 01:49:26,771
All right. When?

1538
01:49:28,025 --> 01:49:30,354
How long will it take me
to get there?

1539
01:49:31,595 --> 01:49:34,079
I'll be there just as quick as I can.

1540
01:49:35,832 --> 01:49:37,933
- It worked.
- You're taking an awful chance.

1541
01:49:37,934 --> 01:49:40,224
He'll be here in 10 minutes.

1542
01:49:41,371 --> 01:49:44,205
Go and make sure
that back door is locked...

1543
01:49:44,206 --> 01:49:47,581
...and then close these curtains.
I'll get rid of the car.

1544
01:49:58,686 --> 01:50:01,209
You're the one who's shaking now.

1545
01:50:01,454 --> 01:50:03,599
I'm scared, angel.

1546
01:50:03,823 --> 01:50:05,850
I'm sore too.

1547
01:50:06,092 --> 01:50:09,294
Mars has been ahead of me
all the way. Way ahead!

1548
01:50:09,295 --> 01:50:13,088
If I don't get the jump on him
this time, we're cooked.

1549
01:50:25,843 --> 01:50:27,596
Here they are.

1550
01:50:30,814 --> 01:50:32,345
Watch the back.

1551
01:50:32,349 --> 01:50:35,685
If you see anybody coming,
yell like you did before.

1552
01:50:49,164 --> 01:50:51,388
- What?
- The curtain! Stop it swinging.

1553
01:51:40,843 --> 01:51:43,311
I got here first.
Put those scissors down.

1554
01:51:43,312 --> 01:51:44,999
Put them down!

1555
01:51:48,617 --> 01:51:50,408
Turn around.

1556
01:51:58,059 --> 01:51:59,667
Over there.

1557
01:52:08,601 --> 01:52:10,171
Sit down.

1558
01:52:13,139 --> 01:52:15,206
There's two men out in back.

1559
01:52:15,207 --> 01:52:17,574
- Watch them.
- Hello, Mr. Mars.

1560
01:52:17,575 --> 01:52:20,296
- You double-crossing...
- I told you to sit down.

1561
01:52:23,448 --> 01:52:25,949
And leave her out of it.
She's all right.

1562
01:52:25,950 --> 01:52:28,751
She kept her deal.
She didn't tell me a thing...

1563
01:52:28,752 --> 01:52:31,387
...except that she killed Regan.
I didn't believe that.

1564
01:52:31,388 --> 01:52:33,890
Regan's dead,
but she didn't do it.

1565
01:52:33,891 --> 01:52:36,324
It was Carmen, wasn't it?
How'd it happen?

1566
01:52:36,325 --> 01:52:38,960
- She didn't tell...?
- I asked you how it happened.

1567
01:52:38,961 --> 01:52:42,097
- Carmen liked Regan.
- But he liked your wife.

1568
01:52:42,098 --> 01:52:43,899
He said no to Carmen.

1569
01:52:43,900 --> 01:52:47,468
She gets mad when anybody says that.
I've seen her that way.

1570
01:52:47,469 --> 01:52:51,071
She was high. When it was over,
she couldn't remember much about it.

1571
01:52:51,072 --> 01:52:52,681
I've seen her that way too.

1572
01:52:52,908 --> 01:52:55,074
- You hid the body.
- You can't prove it.

1573
01:52:55,075 --> 01:52:57,544
It's just as bad for you
if I prove it to myself.

1574
01:52:57,545 --> 01:52:59,345
Then you blackmailed
Mrs. Rutledge...

1575
01:52:59,346 --> 01:53:01,681
...by telling her
what Carmen had done.

1576
01:53:01,682 --> 01:53:04,183
How did you prove to her
that Carmen had done it?

1577
01:53:04,184 --> 01:53:05,635
Prove it to me.

1578
01:53:05,652 --> 01:53:07,103
You've seen her when she's that way.

1579
01:53:07,120 --> 01:53:09,187
Sure I have. Have you?

1580
01:53:09,589 --> 01:53:12,232
Why didn't you know her
when you walked in here?

1581
01:53:12,391 --> 01:53:16,028
You're pretty smart,
but I've been waiting for this one.

1582
01:53:17,429 --> 01:53:18,579
What are you gonna do?

1583
01:53:18,630 --> 01:53:21,098
I said you're smart.
You walked in without a gun.

1584
01:53:21,099 --> 01:53:23,700
You'd agree to everything,
just like you're doing now.

1585
01:53:23,701 --> 01:53:25,669
When I left,
things would be different.

1586
01:53:25,670 --> 01:53:28,305
That's what those boys
are doing out there.

1587
01:53:28,306 --> 01:53:31,040
But everything's changed now,
since I got here first.

1588
01:53:31,041 --> 01:53:32,675
Angel, get on the floor!

1589
01:53:32,676 --> 01:53:34,543
Don't get excited, Marlowe.

1590
01:53:34,544 --> 01:53:37,746
If anything happens, if there's
any shooting, you'll just...

1591
01:53:37,747 --> 01:53:40,949
What do you think will happen now?
What'll your boys think?

1592
01:53:40,950 --> 01:53:43,685
What'll they do to
the first one out that door?

1593
01:53:43,686 --> 01:53:45,217
Who's it gonna be, you or me?

1594
01:53:45,221 --> 01:53:47,255
- Now look...
- You look at this!

1595
01:53:47,256 --> 01:53:49,165
Haven't you ever seen a gun?

1596
01:53:49,457 --> 01:53:51,558
Want me to count,
like in the movies?

1597
01:53:51,559 --> 01:53:53,193
That's what Canino said to Jonesy.

1598
01:53:53,194 --> 01:53:55,562
- Don't go crazy!
- Jonesy took it better.

1599
01:53:55,897 --> 01:53:58,081
- That's one, Eddie.
- Don't! Don't!

1600
01:53:58,765 --> 01:54:00,636
That's two, Eddie!

1601
01:54:01,235 --> 01:54:03,341
Don't shoot! It's me, Mars!

1602
01:54:47,009 --> 01:54:48,265
Bernie?

1603
01:54:48,310 --> 01:54:50,141
This is Marlowe.

1604
01:54:50,512 --> 01:54:52,546
I've got some more red points for you.

1605
01:54:52,547 --> 01:54:55,215
<i>- Who is it this time?
- Eddie Mars.</i>

1606
01:54:55,216 --> 01:54:56,816
His boys got him.

1607
01:54:56,817 --> 01:54:59,586
There's more to it than that.
He killed Regan.

1608
01:54:59,587 --> 01:55:01,038
I'll tell you when I see you.

1609
01:55:01,055 --> 01:55:02,231
<i>Where are you?</i>

1610
01:55:02,289 --> 01:55:06,125
The same place, Laverne Terrace.
Come up and get me out of here.

1611
01:55:06,126 --> 01:55:08,761
And watch yourself.
They may still be outside.

1612
01:55:08,762 --> 01:55:10,332
<i>Right away.</i>

1613
01:55:18,437 --> 01:55:20,004
It won't take him long.

1614
01:55:20,005 --> 01:55:22,607
Wait a minute, let me do the talking.

1615
01:55:22,874 --> 01:55:27,322
I don't know what I'll tell him,
but it'll be pretty close to the truth.

1616
01:55:27,712 --> 01:55:29,812
You'll have to send Carmen away...

1617
01:55:29,813 --> 01:55:31,514
...from a lot of things.

1618
01:55:31,515 --> 01:55:33,621
They have places for that.

1619
01:55:33,817 --> 01:55:36,957
Maybe they can cure her.
It's been done before.

1620
01:55:37,487 --> 01:55:41,581
We'll have to tell your father
about Regan. I think he can take it.

1621
01:55:41,724 --> 01:55:44,014
You've forgotten one thing.

1622
01:55:44,493 --> 01:55:45,749
Me.

1623
01:55:49,297 --> 01:55:51,168
What's wrong with you?

1624
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,485
Nothing you can't fix.
