1
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:14,941
<i>This is Berk,</i>

2
00:01:14,942 --> 00:01:19,479
<i>the best kept secret this
side of, well... anywhere.</i>

3
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,214
<i>Granted, it may not look like much,</i>

4
00:01:21,215 --> 00:01:25,618
<i>but this wet heap of rock packs
more than a few surprises.</i>

5
00:01:31,024 --> 00:01:35,528
<i>Life here is amazing,
just not for the faint of heart.</i>

6
00:01:35,529 --> 00:01:39,908
<i>You see, where most folks enjoy
hobbies like whittling or needlepoint,</i>

7
00:01:39,909 --> 00:01:42,469
<i>we Berkians prefer...</i>

8
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:46,106
<i>a little something we like to call...</i>

9
00:01:48,107 --> 00:01:50,444
<i>Dragon racing!</i>

10
00:02:03,722 --> 00:02:08,094
Ho-ho! I'm sorry, Fishlegs,
did you want that?

11
00:02:09,355 --> 00:02:11,831
Oh, Snotlout, that was mine!

12
00:02:11,832 --> 00:02:13,433
Here you go, babe.

13
00:02:13,434 --> 00:02:15,929
Did I tell you that you look
amazing today? 'Cause you do.

14
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:19,447
Ugh! Come on, Barf.
It's starting to stink around here.

15
00:02:19,448 --> 00:02:23,175
Nope, still hates you.
Let's blow this place, Belch!

16
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:25,870
All right!

17
00:02:30,951 --> 00:02:32,585
Oh, yeah!

18
00:02:32,586 --> 00:02:36,022
Ah, ha-ha! That's nine for the twins!

19
00:02:36,023 --> 00:02:38,358
Astrid lags with three!

20
00:02:38,359 --> 00:02:42,328
Fishlegs and Snotlout
trail with none!

21
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:44,596
And Hiccup is...

22
00:02:44,897 --> 00:02:47,700
Nowhere to be found. Hmm.

23
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:51,503
Scared him off with the big talk,
didn't you, Stoick?

24
00:02:52,772 --> 00:02:55,442
What are you doing, Snotlout?
They're gonna win now.

25
00:02:55,443 --> 00:02:58,111
She's my princess...
whatever she wants, she gets.

26
00:02:58,112 --> 00:03:01,414
Ruffnut? Didn't she try
to bury you alive?

27
00:03:01,415 --> 00:03:04,083
Only for a few hours.

28
00:03:04,986 --> 00:03:08,388
<i>Now, dragons used to be
a bit of a problem here,</i>

29
00:03:08,389 --> 00:03:12,525
<i>but that was five years ago.
Now they've all moved in.</i>

30
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:14,894
<i>And, really, why wouldn't they?</i>

31
00:03:14,895 --> 00:03:18,998
<i>We have custom stables,
all-you-can-eat feeding stations,</i>

32
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:21,735
<i>a full-service dragon wash...</i>

33
00:03:22,136 --> 00:03:26,705
<i>Even top-of-the-line fire
prevention, if I do say so myself.</i>

34
00:03:28,007 --> 00:03:31,843
- Ah, it's time, Gobber.
- Righty-ho. Last lap!

35
00:03:36,082 --> 00:03:39,751
The black sheep! Come on, Stormfly!
We can still win this thing!

36
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:44,622
- Come on, Barf!
- Let's go!

37
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:46,726
Go, Meatlug!

38
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,595
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

39
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:54,432
This is your big moment.
Have a nice flight.

40
00:03:57,503 --> 00:03:59,572
Up! Up, up, up, up, up!

41
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:05,145
Good job, Meatlug!

42
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:08,747
Here you go, darling.
Mine's worth ten.

43
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:10,149
Yeah! The black sheep!

44
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:14,020
You guys are fighting for Ruffnut?

45
00:04:14,021 --> 00:04:16,456
- I'm totally winning!
- We're winning together.

46
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,525
Oh, no!

47
00:04:21,128 --> 00:04:23,176
Whoo! No one can stop me now!

48
00:04:23,177 --> 00:04:25,865
Except for me.
We're attached, genius.

49
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:28,800
- Quit trying to steal all my glory!
- Hey!

50
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:30,566
Get them, Astrid!

51
00:04:30,592 --> 00:04:33,185
- It's my glory!
- Always ruining everything!

52
00:04:33,186 --> 00:04:36,843
- No, sheep, no glory!
- Gotcha! Ha-ha!

53
00:04:36,844 --> 00:04:38,244
- Whoa!
- Astrid!

54
00:04:38,245 --> 00:04:40,913
Well played!

55
00:04:40,914 --> 00:04:43,782
That's my future daughter-in-law!

56
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:46,517
Whoo-hoo!

57
00:04:47,119 --> 00:04:49,922
- Uh, excuse me.
- Stormfly!

58
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:55,561
Whoa!

59
00:05:01,935 --> 00:05:05,271
That's 13! Astrid takes the game!

60
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:10,109
<i>Yep, Berk is pretty much perfect.</i>

61
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:13,946
<i>All of my hard work has paid off.
And it's a good thing, too,</i>

62
00:05:13,947 --> 00:05:16,848
<i>because with Vikings on
the backs of dragons...</i>

63
00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:20,086
<i>the world just got
a whole lot bigger.</i>

64
00:05:36,835 --> 00:05:38,269
Yeah!

65
00:06:20,145 --> 00:06:23,883
What do you think, bud?
You want to give this another shot?

66
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:27,618
Toothless! It'll be fine.

67
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:32,259
Ready?

68
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:40,700
Yeah...!

69
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:46,238
Yeah!

70
00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:55,680
Whoa!

71
00:07:17,037 --> 00:07:19,037
Whoa!

72
00:07:19,805 --> 00:07:21,974
Yeah!

73
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:27,546
This is amazing!

74
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:30,282
No longer amazing. Toothless!

75
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:34,286
Oh, no!

76
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:44,196
Whoa!

77
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,843
That really came out of nowhere.

78
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:06,118
We-we got to work on your
solo gliding there, bud.

79
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:11,655
That, uh, locked-up tail makes for some
pretty sloppy rescue maneuvers, hey?

80
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:31,343
Looks like we found another one, bud.

81
00:08:35,415 --> 00:08:38,684
Oh, what, do you want an apology?

82
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:41,587
Is that why you're pouting,
big baby boo?

83
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:45,458
Well, try this on!

84
00:08:45,459 --> 00:08:50,562
Oh, you feeling it yet? Huh?
Picking up on all my heartfelt remorse?

85
00:08:52,898 --> 00:08:56,769
Ah. Yeah. Oh, come on, come on,
you-you wouldn't hurt a one-legged...

86
00:08:57,170 --> 00:09:01,507
Uh... Y-you're right, you're right.
You win. You win.

87
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:07,947
He's down! And it's ugly!
Dragons and Vikings...

88
00:09:07,948 --> 00:09:11,784
Enemies again. Locked in
combat to the bitter...

89
00:09:11,785 --> 00:09:13,852
Oh...!

90
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,227
You know that doesn't wash out.

91
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:48,328
So, what should we name it?

92
00:09:49,329 --> 00:09:51,222
"Itchy armpit" it is.

93
00:09:52,691 --> 00:09:57,295
What do you reckon, bud? Think we might
find a few Timberjacks in those woods?

94
00:09:57,296 --> 00:10:00,697
The odd whispering death
or two in the rocks?

95
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:05,905
Who knows, maybe we'll finally
track down another Night Fury.

96
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,066
Wouldn't that be something.

97
00:10:10,092 --> 00:10:12,745
So, what do you say? Just keep going?

98
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:26,198
Afternoon, milady.
Where have you been?

99
00:10:26,199 --> 00:10:28,169
Hi.

100
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:32,064
Oh, winning races. What else?

101
00:10:32,065 --> 00:10:35,201
The real question is,
where have you been?

102
00:10:35,202 --> 00:10:38,437
- Avoiding my dad.
- Oh, no. What happened now?

103
00:10:38,438 --> 00:10:40,573
Oh, you're gonna...
You're gonna love this.

104
00:10:40,574 --> 00:10:45,811
I wake up, the sun's shining, terrible
terrors are singing on the rooftop,

105
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:50,081
I saunter down to breakfast thinking
all is right with the world, and I get:

106
00:10:50,082 --> 00:10:52,051
"Son, we need to talk."

107
00:10:52,052 --> 00:10:56,088
"Not, now, Dad. I got a whole day
of goofing off to get started."

108
00:10:56,089 --> 00:11:00,676
Okay, first of all, I-I don't sound
like that. What is this character?

109
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:02,461
And-and second...

110
00:11:02,462 --> 00:11:04,897
What is that thing you're
doing with my shoulders?

111
00:11:04,898 --> 00:11:08,234
Yeah, that's-that's a really
flattering impersonation.

112
00:11:08,235 --> 00:11:10,502
Anyway, he goes...

113
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:13,933
"You're the pride of Berk, son,
and I couldn't be prouder."

114
00:11:13,934 --> 00:11:18,277
Aw, thanks, Dad. I'm pretty
impressed with myself, too.

115
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:21,447
When have I ever done
that with my hands?

116
00:11:21,448 --> 00:11:25,017
- You just did!
- Okay, just...

117
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:26,418
Hold... still.

118
00:11:27,654 --> 00:11:30,154
- Very serious.
- Mm-hmm.

119
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:33,626
"You're all grown up,

120
00:11:33,627 --> 00:11:36,462
"and since no chief could
ask for a better successor...

121
00:11:36,463 --> 00:11:38,369
- I've decided..."
- To make you chief!

122
00:11:38,395 --> 00:11:41,300
Oh, my gods! Hiccup, that's amazing!

123
00:11:41,301 --> 00:11:42,902
Oh...!

124
00:11:42,903 --> 00:11:47,506
Y-you're gonna wear out the spring coil.
The calibration is very sensitive.

125
00:11:52,112 --> 00:11:54,258
Yeah, so...

126
00:11:54,284 --> 00:11:56,982
this is what I'm dealing with.

127
00:11:57,483 --> 00:11:58,650
What did you tell him?

128
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:01,920
I-I didn't. By the time he
turned around, I was gone.

129
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:06,391
Huh. Well... it's a lot
of responsibility.

130
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:08,894
The map will have to wait, for sure,

131
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:13,031
and... and I'll need to fly Toothless,
since you'll be too busy, but...

132
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:22,249
I-it's not me, Astrid. All those speeches
and planning and running the village,

133
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:25,518
- that's his thing.
- I think you're missing the point.

134
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:28,580
I mean... chief. What an honor!

135
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,149
I'd be pretty excited.

136
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:33,052
I-I... I'm not like you.

137
00:12:33,053 --> 00:12:38,056
You... know exactly who you are,
you always have, but...

138
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:42,461
I'm still looking. I know
that I'm not my father,

139
00:12:42,462 --> 00:12:47,732
and I never met my mother, so...
What does that make me?

140
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:57,476
What you're searching for
isn't out there, Hiccup...

141
00:12:57,577 --> 00:12:59,655
It's in here.

142
00:13:00,481 --> 00:13:03,282
Maybe you just don't see it yet.

143
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:05,317
- Ugh. Ugh!
- Maybe.

144
00:13:05,318 --> 00:13:09,989
But, you know...
There is something out there.

145
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:11,789
Hiccup...

146
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:42,753
Wow...

147
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:48,293
Stay close.

148
00:14:00,305 --> 00:14:02,574
What happened here?

149
00:14:08,513 --> 00:14:10,282
All right, e-easy, bud.

150
00:14:10,283 --> 00:14:11,650
Hiccup!

151
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:14,818
- Fire!
- Astrid, look out!

152
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:19,490
Hiccup!

153
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:25,597
Watch the tail!

154
00:14:27,267 --> 00:14:29,234
Tie those legs up!

155
00:14:32,572 --> 00:14:34,045
Is that what I think it is?

156
00:14:34,046 --> 00:14:37,051
- Stop!
- Stormfly!

157
00:14:37,677 --> 00:14:39,679
What are you doing?!

158
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,447
Back again!

159
00:14:44,349 --> 00:14:49,388
Soil my britches.
That is a Night Fury.

160
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:51,490
Thought they were all gone for good.

161
00:14:51,491 --> 00:14:54,393
Looks like our luck's had a
turn for the better, lads!

162
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:58,397
Don't think Drago has one of
those... in his dragon army.

163
00:14:58,398 --> 00:14:59,698
Dragon army?

164
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:01,700
Look, we don't want any trouble.

165
00:15:01,701 --> 00:15:06,605
Hah! You should have thought of that
before you stole all of our dragons

166
00:15:06,606 --> 00:15:08,173
and blasted our fort to bits!

167
00:15:09,876 --> 00:15:12,444
- Wait.
- What are you talking about?

168
00:15:12,445 --> 00:15:14,179
You think we did this?

169
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:17,783
Hah! Dragon trapping is
hard enough work as it is

170
00:15:17,784 --> 00:15:21,900
without do-gooder Dragon Riders
sneaking in to rescue them.

171
00:15:21,926 --> 00:15:26,292
What do-gooder...?
There are other Dragon Riders?

172
00:15:26,318 --> 00:15:28,972
You mean other than your
thieving friend from last night?

173
00:15:28,973 --> 00:15:33,279
You tell me. You may have an
ice-spitting dragon on your side,

174
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:35,734
but we still have a quota to fill.

175
00:15:35,735 --> 00:15:39,104
How do you suppose we explain
this mess to Drago Bludvist?

176
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:42,708
Drago what-fist?
Does anything you say make sense?

177
00:15:42,709 --> 00:15:46,945
He's expecting a new shipment of
dragons for his army by tomorrow.

178
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:50,449
And Drago don't take well to excuses!

179
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:54,653
This is what he gave me last
time I showed up empty-handed.

180
00:15:54,654 --> 00:15:58,757
He promised to be far less
understanding in the future.

181
00:15:58,758 --> 00:16:01,527
All right, look, we don't know
anything about a dragon thief

182
00:16:01,528 --> 00:16:07,332
or an ice-spitting dragon or your
lunatic boss and his dragon army, okay?

183
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:10,435
Just give us back our dragon,
and we'll go...

184
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:13,038
Strange, hostile person
whom we've never met.

185
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:15,240
Oh, where are my manners?

186
00:16:15,241 --> 00:16:19,444
I'm Eret... Son of Eret.

187
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:22,713
Finest dragon trapper alive.

188
00:16:22,714 --> 00:16:27,486
After all... It's not just anyone
who can capture a Night Fury.

189
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:31,790
And this is Toothless.
He says we're going. Now.

190
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:34,826
Hah! They all say that.

191
00:16:35,027 --> 00:16:37,163
Rush 'em, lads!

192
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:46,136
Stormfly, come on! Go! Go!

193
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:53,712
You will never hold on to
those dragons! You hear me?!

194
00:16:53,713 --> 00:16:56,580
Drago is coming for them all!

195
00:16:58,984 --> 00:17:01,954
- Come on, Meatlug!
- Whoo-hoo!

196
00:17:11,097 --> 00:17:13,966
- Hey there, Stoick!
- Hey, how are you? Beautiful day.

197
00:17:13,967 --> 00:17:16,268
- Hello, Spitelout. Great race.
- Yeah...

198
00:17:16,269 --> 00:17:18,798
Oh! Sorry, Mrs. Ack. Any sign of him?

199
00:17:18,824 --> 00:17:22,341
Eh! He's probably flown off
the edge of the world by now.

200
00:17:22,342 --> 00:17:25,310
You sure you want that
kid running the village?

201
00:17:25,311 --> 00:17:29,982
- You can still delay your retirement.
- Oh, he's ready. You'll see.

202
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:36,353
There he is! Huh? The pride of Berk!

203
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:39,858
Who finally decided to
show up for work. Yay.

204
00:17:39,859 --> 00:17:42,961
Sorry, got held up. Hey, uh,
Dad, could I have a word?

205
00:17:42,962 --> 00:17:44,630
Something you're itching to tell me?

206
00:17:44,631 --> 00:17:47,666
Uh, not quite the itch you're
thinking of, but, yes.

207
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:50,124
Oh, good man! Now, lesson one:

208
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:53,805
A chief's first duty is
to his people, so... 41!

209
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:55,474
Well, can we just
talk in private for...

210
00:17:55,475 --> 00:17:58,243
- Forty...
- That's me! That's me! I'm next!

211
00:17:58,244 --> 00:18:00,312
- Hey, I was ahead of you!
- If we could just talk...

212
00:18:00,313 --> 00:18:02,661
Excuse me. I've been here
all day. Okay, okay...

213
00:18:02,687 --> 00:18:06,204
I want one of those high
seaters with lots of spikes...

214
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:10,124
- and a big storage compartment!
- Absolutely! You got it, sir.

215
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:13,325
Dad, this is actually a little more
important than building saddles.

216
00:18:13,326 --> 00:18:17,396
Ah, lesson two: No task is too small
when it comes to serving your people.

217
00:18:17,397 --> 00:18:19,498
- But, Dad...
- Oh, excuse us, grump.

218
00:18:19,499 --> 00:18:21,200
- Can we just talk...
- Yah! Grump!

219
00:18:21,201 --> 00:18:24,036
You let the forge die down again!

220
00:18:29,876 --> 00:18:31,910
That's it, grump!
You're going up for adoption.

221
00:18:31,911 --> 00:18:33,512
- Okay, uh...
- There you go.

222
00:18:33,513 --> 00:18:34,981
- Dad...
- Go on. Have away.

223
00:18:34,982 --> 00:18:40,019
Yeah, but seriously, I really need to tell
you about this new land we came across.

224
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,887
- Another one?
- Any new dragons?

225
00:18:41,888 --> 00:18:43,755
We didn't stick around to find out.

226
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:47,125
These folks weren't
particularly friendly.

227
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:50,700
Oh, really? Your Night Fury and
Deadly Nadder didn't bring them...

228
00:18:50,726 --> 00:18:53,440
- cheering to the rooftops?
- No, this was different.

229
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:57,099
Not the standard run-for-the-hills
hoo-ha I've come to enjoy.

230
00:18:57,125 --> 00:19:01,573
These guys were trappers.
Dragon trappers.

231
00:19:01,574 --> 00:19:03,008
You should have seen their fort.

232
00:19:03,009 --> 00:19:07,279
All blown apart and stuck in giant
spikes of ice. It was weird.

233
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,750
I've never seen anything like it.
And worst of all, they thought we did it!

234
00:19:11,751 --> 00:19:15,921
You know, you two are gonna get yourselves
in serious trouble one of these days.

235
00:19:15,922 --> 00:19:19,091
Not everyone appreciates
this way of life.

236
00:19:19,092 --> 00:19:22,060
Aye, Gobber's right, son.
Best we keep to our own.

237
00:19:22,061 --> 00:19:26,965
Besides, you'll have more important
uses for your time. Huh-huh?

238
00:19:26,966 --> 00:19:29,868
Once we make the big announcement!

239
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:33,670
They are building a dragon army.

240
00:19:34,406 --> 00:19:37,909
Or-or at least the guy
they work for is. Uh...

241
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:41,245
"Dargo... bloody fist" or something.

242
00:19:42,847 --> 00:19:46,818
I'll bloody his fist with my face
if he tries to take my dragon!

243
00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:47,887
Or mine!

244
00:19:47,913 --> 00:19:50,856
- Ugh! You're such a moron.
- A beautiful moron.

245
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:52,391
Yeah.

246
00:19:52,392 --> 00:19:55,560
Bludvist? Drago Bludvist?

247
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:59,229
Uh, yeah. Wait... you know him?

248
00:20:01,733 --> 00:20:04,002
- Ground all dragons!
- What? Why?

249
00:20:04,003 --> 00:20:06,741
Seal the gates!
Lower the storm doors!

250
00:20:06,767 --> 00:20:08,691
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait,
wait. What is happening?

251
00:20:08,717 --> 00:20:11,842
Come on! You heard
the man, lock it down!

252
00:20:12,943 --> 00:20:17,849
No dragon or Viking sets foot off
this island until I give the word!

253
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:21,886
Wait, because some guy you knew is
stirring up trouble in some faraway land?

254
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:26,458
Because Drago Bludvist is a madman
without conscience or mercy.

255
00:20:26,459 --> 00:20:30,828
And if he's built a dragon army,
gods help us all.

256
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:32,728
- Get them into their pens!
- Aye, Stoick.

257
00:20:32,754 --> 00:20:34,866
- Quickly!
- Then let's ride back out there.

258
00:20:34,867 --> 00:20:38,670
We'll follow those trappers to Drago
and talk some sense into him.

259
00:20:38,671 --> 00:20:40,438
No. We fortify the island.

260
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:44,209
- It's our duty to keep the peace.
- Peace is over, Hiccup.

261
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:46,812
- I must prepare you for war.
- War?

262
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:52,050
Dad, if Drago's coming for our dragons,
we can't wait around for him to get here.

263
00:20:52,051 --> 00:20:55,120
Let's go find him and
change his mind.

264
00:20:55,121 --> 00:20:57,614
No, some minds won't
be changed, Hiccup.

265
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:02,694
Berk is what you need to worry about.
A chief protects his own.

266
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:06,665
Secure the stables!
Latch every stall!

267
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:08,467
- Hiccup, don't.
- I have to.

268
00:21:08,468 --> 00:21:10,299
This way! Quickly!

269
00:21:12,804 --> 00:21:14,905
Hiccup!

270
00:21:16,074 --> 00:21:17,741
Come on!

271
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:20,711
Hiccup!

272
00:21:30,755 --> 00:21:32,957
Keep your eyes peeled, lads!

273
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,794
With this wind,
we'll reach Drago by daybreak.

274
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:39,764
So best we fill this ship
up with dragons, and quick!

275
00:21:39,765 --> 00:21:41,833
- It's no time to be picky!
- Uh, Eret?

276
00:21:41,834 --> 00:21:44,168
Not if we want to keep our...

277
00:21:45,604 --> 00:21:48,773
heads! Off the port quarter!

278
00:21:48,774 --> 00:21:50,976
Net them, lads! Take them down!

279
00:21:50,977 --> 00:21:54,112
There's two of them! Up on the left!

280
00:21:54,713 --> 00:21:56,815
You're not getting away this time.

281
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:58,582
Fire!

282
00:21:58,783 --> 00:21:59,984
Reload!

283
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:03,354
Come on, reload! Incoming!

284
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:08,360
And here I was, worried we
might turn up empty-handed.

285
00:22:08,361 --> 00:22:10,896
Nope. It's your lucky day.

286
00:22:11,297 --> 00:22:13,029
We give up.

287
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:17,803
That's one Night Fury, uh,
one Deadly Nadder, and...

288
00:22:17,804 --> 00:22:21,039
Two of the finest Dragon
Riders west of Luk Tuk.

289
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,841
That ought to make
the boss happy, right?

290
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:25,610
Excuse us.

291
00:22:25,611 --> 00:22:28,547
- What are you doing?
- Toothless, stay.

292
00:22:29,816 --> 00:22:32,714
Uh, the dragons don't really
care for cramped spaces,

293
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:35,887
so they'll just hang out with you.
They won't be any trouble.

294
00:22:37,323 --> 00:22:41,893
Unless you do that. You know,
wooden boats, big ocean...

295
00:22:41,894 --> 00:22:44,996
- H-how is your swimming?
- Not good.

296
00:22:46,532 --> 00:22:50,302
Oops. Almost forget.
Can't have armed prisoners.

297
00:22:50,303 --> 00:22:52,037
How is this a plan?

298
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:54,973
Just what every dragon trapper needs.

299
00:22:54,974 --> 00:22:58,310
One end coats the blade in
monstrous nightmare saliva.

300
00:22:58,311 --> 00:23:01,079
The other sprays hideous
zippleback gas.

301
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,949
All it takes is a spark, and...

302
00:23:05,317 --> 00:23:06,718
Oh, yeah, there you go.

303
00:23:07,954 --> 00:23:09,655
Once they see you
as one of their own,

304
00:23:09,656 --> 00:23:12,924
even the testiest dragons
can be trained. Right, bud?

305
00:23:12,925 --> 00:23:15,360
Give me that!

306
00:23:15,961 --> 00:23:17,662
What game are you playing?

307
00:23:17,663 --> 00:23:20,331
Uh, no game. We just
want to meet Drago.

308
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:21,466
Why?

309
00:23:21,467 --> 00:23:24,435
Because I'm going to change
his mind about dragons.

310
00:23:28,173 --> 00:23:29,808
He can be really persuasive.

311
00:23:29,809 --> 00:23:34,712
Once you've earned his loyalty, there
is nothing a dragon won't do for you.

312
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:37,582
You won't be changing
any minds around here.

313
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:41,585
I can change yours,
right here, right now.

314
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:44,923
Uh, may I?

315
00:23:48,993 --> 00:23:50,929
- Watch it!
- Dragon Riders!

316
00:23:58,337 --> 00:23:59,738
Put me down!

317
00:23:59,739 --> 00:24:04,042
- Snotlout, what-what are you doing?
- See how well I protect and provide?

318
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:07,812
- What is with all the nets?
- Hey, watch it! That was...

319
00:24:07,813 --> 00:24:10,814
Close.

320
00:24:13,018 --> 00:24:15,919
Oh, my.

321
00:24:18,157 --> 00:24:20,390
Me likey.

322
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:26,197
Take me.

323
00:24:29,235 --> 00:24:30,534
Hold your fire!

324
00:24:35,274 --> 00:24:37,208
Um, what are you guys doing here?

325
00:24:37,209 --> 00:24:41,146
- We're here to rescue you!
- I don't need to be rescued.

326
00:24:41,147 --> 00:24:43,080
Enough!

327
00:24:44,715 --> 00:24:48,386
Well, didn't you just
pick the wrong ship, eh?

328
00:24:48,387 --> 00:24:51,022
I am Eret, Son of... Eret...

329
00:24:52,658 --> 00:24:53,825
I...

330
00:24:55,161 --> 00:24:57,362
Get this thing off me.

331
00:24:57,363 --> 00:25:00,899
Anyone else?
Hmm, that's what I figured.

332
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:04,002
You, saddle up. We're going home.

333
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:05,837
No.

334
00:25:05,838 --> 00:25:07,839
Of all the irresponsible...

335
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,009
I'm trying to protect our
dragons and stop a war.

336
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:15,379
- How is that irresponsible?
- Because war is what he wants, son!

337
00:25:20,953 --> 00:25:23,722
Years ago, there was a great
gathering of chieftains...

338
00:25:23,723 --> 00:25:26,458
<i>to discuss the dragon
scourge we all faced.</i>

339
00:25:26,459 --> 00:25:30,995
<i>Into our midst came a
stranger from a strange land,</i>

340
00:25:30,996 --> 00:25:34,766
<i>covered in scars and draped
in a cloak of dragon skin.</i>

341
00:25:35,835 --> 00:25:39,437
<i>He carried no weapon
and spoke softly,</i>

342
00:25:39,438 --> 00:25:44,909
<i>saying that he, Drago Bludvist,
was a man of the people,</i>

343
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:49,481
<i>devoted to freeing mankind
from the tyranny of dragons.</i>

344
00:25:49,482 --> 00:25:51,850
<i>He claimed that he alone
could control the dragons,</i>

345
00:25:51,851 --> 00:25:55,751
<i>and that he alone could
keep us safe, if...</i>

346
00:25:55,752 --> 00:25:59,500
<i>we chose to bow down and follow him.</i>

347
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,229
- Stupid.
- Ah, good one.

348
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:06,631
Aye, we laughed, too...

349
00:26:06,632 --> 00:26:09,668
<i>Until he wrapped himself in
his cloak and cried out,</i>

350
00:26:09,669 --> 00:26:13,571
<i>- "then see how well you do without me!"</i>
- See how well you do without me!

351
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:17,489
<i>The rooftop suddenly burst
into flames, and from it,</i>

352
00:26:17,515 --> 00:26:20,097
<i>armored dragons descended,</i>

353
00:26:20,123 --> 00:26:23,173
<i>burning the hall to the ground.</i>

354
00:26:23,849 --> 00:26:26,184
I...

355
00:26:26,185 --> 00:26:29,219
Was the only one to escape.

356
00:26:33,458 --> 00:26:37,395
Men who kill without reason
cannot be reasoned with.

357
00:26:37,396 --> 00:26:38,964
- Maybe.
- Hiccup!

358
00:26:38,965 --> 00:26:41,531
I'm still going to try.

359
00:26:43,334 --> 00:26:47,605
This is what I'm good at, and-and
if I could change your mind,

360
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:49,973
I can change his, too.

361
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:52,609
Come on.

362
00:26:53,545 --> 00:26:56,801
- Let's go.
- No! Lead the others back to Berk.

363
00:26:56,827 --> 00:26:59,250
I've had enough mutiny for one day.

364
00:27:01,554 --> 00:27:03,321
Ooh, I like that.

365
00:27:03,322 --> 00:27:05,089
Ruffnut!

366
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:07,024
Okay!

367
00:27:28,013 --> 00:27:32,985
Don't worry, bud. I'm not gonna
let anything happen to you.

368
00:27:33,011 --> 00:27:34,578
I promise.

369
00:27:42,393 --> 00:27:45,763
Aw, come on, Dad. Really?

370
00:27:53,872 --> 00:27:55,607
Okay.

371
00:27:55,808 --> 00:27:58,608
No sudden moves.

372
00:28:21,733 --> 00:28:23,833
Hold on, hold on.

373
00:28:35,146 --> 00:28:37,615
Toothless...!

374
00:29:25,997 --> 00:29:29,167
Hey! You left my dragon back there!

375
00:29:29,168 --> 00:29:32,201
He can't fly on his own! He'll drown!

376
00:29:53,659 --> 00:29:55,994
Hey! Uh...

377
00:29:55,995 --> 00:29:58,029
We have to head back for my dragon!

378
00:30:44,108 --> 00:30:46,210
Who are you?

379
00:30:46,411 --> 00:30:49,080
The dragon thief?

380
00:30:49,081 --> 00:30:52,784
Uh... Drago Bludvist?

381
00:30:53,385 --> 00:30:56,687
Do you even understand
what I'm saying?

382
00:31:02,892 --> 00:31:06,230
Toothless! Oh, it's okay,
it's okay, it's okay.

383
00:31:06,231 --> 00:31:09,767
I'm glad to see you, too, bud.
You really had me worried there.

384
00:31:47,705 --> 00:31:48,939
Uh, uh...

385
00:31:54,846 --> 00:31:56,380
Oh...

386
00:31:56,381 --> 00:31:57,682
Hiccup?

387
00:31:57,883 --> 00:31:59,883
Uh...

388
00:32:02,386 --> 00:32:05,055
C-could it be?

389
00:32:05,056 --> 00:32:09,894
After all these years?
How is this possible?

390
00:32:09,895 --> 00:32:14,064
Uh, should I... Should I know you?

391
00:32:14,865 --> 00:32:18,234
No. You were only a babe.

392
00:32:23,241 --> 00:32:26,442
But a mother never forgets.

393
00:32:29,381 --> 00:32:31,448
Shh, shh.

394
00:32:33,885 --> 00:32:35,553
Come.

395
00:32:36,054 --> 00:32:38,492
Boar-headed! Just like his mother!

396
00:32:38,518 --> 00:32:43,381
- Aye, she could never stay put, either.
- Eh, he's just 20, and a Viking.

397
00:32:43,407 --> 00:32:46,030
I mean, could there be a
worse combination? Heh!

398
00:32:46,056 --> 00:32:50,768
When I think of how stubborn and
senseless you were back in the day.

399
00:32:50,769 --> 00:32:55,206
Oh. Well, not much
has changed, actually.

400
00:32:56,808 --> 00:33:00,511
Ah, you know what he's like.
He won't give up, Gobber.

401
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:04,949
And if Hiccup finds Drago
before we find him...

402
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:08,920
Ah! Nothing can hurt Hiccup,
as long as that Night Fury's around.

403
00:33:08,921 --> 00:33:11,087
It's a Night Fury!

404
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:15,559
Huh?

405
00:33:30,541 --> 00:33:32,642
Find them, Skullcrusher.

406
00:33:33,143 --> 00:33:34,579
Find them.

407
00:33:41,953 --> 00:33:44,309
- Uh, h-hold on. Wait just a minute.
- This way.

408
00:33:44,335 --> 00:33:45,617
- Come back here.
- Come.

409
00:33:45,643 --> 00:33:49,227
You can't just say something
like that and run off.

410
00:33:49,228 --> 00:33:52,296
You're my mother?!
I mean, what the...?

411
00:33:52,297 --> 00:33:54,632
Do you... do you grasp
how insane it sounds?

412
00:33:54,633 --> 00:33:56,734
- Come quickly.
- I have questions!

413
00:33:57,928 --> 00:34:00,562
Where have you... been all this time?

414
00:34:01,773 --> 00:34:06,744
What-what have you been doing?
But they-they said you were dead!

415
00:34:06,745 --> 00:34:09,279
Everyone thinks you were eaten by...

416
00:34:49,854 --> 00:34:53,589
This is where you've
been for 20 years?

417
00:34:55,792 --> 00:34:58,594
You-you've been rescuing them.

418
00:35:01,564 --> 00:35:04,062
- Unbelievable.
- You're not upset?

419
00:35:04,088 --> 00:35:06,370
What? No. I-I don't know. I...

420
00:35:06,371 --> 00:35:09,040
It's a bit much to get my
head around, to be frank.

421
00:35:09,041 --> 00:35:12,890
It's not every day you find out
your mother is some kind of...

422
00:35:12,916 --> 00:35:15,880
crazy, feral, vigilante dragon lady.

423
00:35:15,881 --> 00:35:17,282
Oh...

424
00:35:18,483 --> 00:35:20,084
Well...

425
00:35:20,085 --> 00:35:23,354
At least I'm not boring, right?

426
00:35:23,355 --> 00:35:26,123
Well, I suppose there is that...

427
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:30,761
- one specific thing.
- Do-do you like it?

428
00:35:32,698 --> 00:35:34,665
I-I don't have the words.

429
00:35:42,607 --> 00:35:44,809
C-can I...

430
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:48,679
Oh, he's beautiful. Oh.

431
00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:53,384
Oh, incredible.

432
00:35:53,885 --> 00:35:56,287
He might very well be
the last of his kind.

433
00:35:56,288 --> 00:36:00,091
Oh... and look, he's your age.

434
00:36:00,092 --> 00:36:01,492
Wow.

435
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:04,995
No wonder you get along so well.
Oh, yeah? Oh, yeah?

436
00:36:06,765 --> 00:36:09,300
And retractable teeth.

437
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:13,737
- How did you manage...
- I found him in the woods.

438
00:36:13,738 --> 00:36:16,507
He was shot down and wounded.

439
00:36:20,944 --> 00:36:25,983
This Snafflefang lost his leg to one
of Drago Bludvist's iron traps.

440
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:29,620
This Raincutter had her wing
sliced by razor netting.

441
00:36:29,621 --> 00:36:34,892
And this, oh, poor Hobblegrunt
was blinded by a tree snare...

442
00:36:34,893 --> 00:36:38,428
and then left to die
alone and scared.

443
00:36:38,929 --> 00:36:43,000
And what of this? Did Drago
or his trappers do this, too?

444
00:36:43,001 --> 00:36:46,036
Oh. Yeah.

445
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:49,774
Well, crazy thing is...

446
00:36:49,775 --> 00:36:53,711
I'm actually the one
who shot him down.

447
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:57,548
Hey, it's-it's okay, though.
He got me back.

448
00:36:57,549 --> 00:37:00,918
Right, bud? You couldn't
save all of me, could you?

449
00:37:00,919 --> 00:37:05,556
You just had to make
it even. So peg leg.

450
00:37:11,262 --> 00:37:13,764
What did your father think
of your Night Fury friend?

451
00:37:13,765 --> 00:37:17,100
Oh, he-he didn't
take it all that well.

452
00:37:17,502 --> 00:37:21,605
But then, he changed. They all did.

453
00:37:21,606 --> 00:37:25,843
Pretty soon, everyone back
home had dragons of their own.

454
00:37:26,444 --> 00:37:28,746
- If only it were possible.
- No, really.

455
00:37:28,747 --> 00:37:34,051
Believe me, I tried, as well, but people
are not capable of change, Hiccup.

456
00:37:34,352 --> 00:37:36,154
Some of us...

457
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:38,957
Were just born different.

458
00:37:45,729 --> 00:37:49,232
<i>Berk was a land of kill or be killed,</i>

459
00:37:49,233 --> 00:37:51,802
<i>but I believed peace was possible.</i>

460
00:37:53,071 --> 00:37:56,173
Stop! You'll only make it worse!

461
00:37:56,874 --> 00:37:59,543
<i>It was a very unpopular opinion.</i>

462
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:02,113
Hiccup!

463
00:38:02,114 --> 00:38:06,580
<i>Then one night, a dragon
broke into our house,</i>

464
00:38:06,606 --> 00:38:09,186
<i>finding you in the cradle.</i>

465
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:13,139
<i>I rushed to protect you.</i>

466
00:38:16,927 --> 00:38:21,831
<i>But what I saw was proof
of everything I believed.</i>

467
00:38:34,246 --> 00:38:39,884
<i>This wasn't a vicious beast,
but an intelligent, gentle creature,</i>

468
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:43,587
<i>whose soul reflected my own.</i>

469
00:38:45,523 --> 00:38:48,592
- Valka, run!
- No, don't.

470
00:38:50,795 --> 00:38:53,097
Oh...

471
00:38:53,298 --> 00:38:55,766
Hold on!

472
00:38:56,567 --> 00:39:00,270
- No! Stoick!
- Valka!

473
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:03,475
Stoick!

474
00:39:05,476 --> 00:39:07,511
Valka.

475
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:11,682
<i>You and your father
nearly died that night.</i>

476
00:39:11,683 --> 00:39:15,185
All because I couldn't kill a dragon.

477
00:39:15,586 --> 00:39:18,088
Eh, runs in the family.

478
00:39:18,089 --> 00:39:24,126
It broke my heart to stay away,
but I believed you'd be safer if I did.

479
00:39:25,229 --> 00:39:26,723
How did you survive?

480
00:39:26,749 --> 00:39:29,833
Oh, Cloudjumper never
meant to harm me.

481
00:39:29,834 --> 00:39:33,270
He must have thought
I belonged here...

482
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:38,106
in the home of the
great Bewilderbeast.

483
00:39:38,142 --> 00:39:40,438
The Alpha species.

484
00:39:40,464 --> 00:39:44,372
One of the very few that still exist.

485
00:39:46,251 --> 00:39:51,822
Every nest has its queen,
but this is the king of all dragons.

486
00:39:51,823 --> 00:39:56,527
With his icy breath,
this graceful giant built our nest,

487
00:39:56,528 --> 00:40:00,263
a safe haven for dragons everywhere.

488
00:40:00,264 --> 00:40:05,102
Wait, that's the ice-spitter?
He's responsible for all that destruction?

489
00:40:05,103 --> 00:40:07,171
He protects us.

490
00:40:07,572 --> 00:40:11,141
We all live under his
care and his command.

491
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:16,813
All but the babies, of course...

492
00:40:19,084 --> 00:40:22,352
who listen to no one.

493
00:40:34,665 --> 00:40:38,327
<i>I've lived among them
for 20 years, Hiccup,</i>

494
00:40:38,353 --> 00:40:41,060
<i>discovering their secrets.</i>

495
00:40:43,803 --> 00:40:46,377
- He likes you.
- Wow.

496
00:40:46,578 --> 00:40:47,911
You must be hungry.

497
00:40:47,912 --> 00:40:52,981
- Uh, yeah, I could eat.
- Good. It's feeding time.

498
00:41:01,659 --> 00:41:05,162
I don't like it. They should've
been back with Hiccup by now.

499
00:41:05,163 --> 00:41:09,064
I don't like it, either. Eret, Son
of Eret, was the man of my dreams.

500
00:41:09,090 --> 00:41:10,401
My everything!

501
00:41:10,402 --> 00:41:14,505
- But, baby, I grew facial hair for you.
- Me, too.

502
00:41:14,506 --> 00:41:19,009
What if Drago shot them down?
What if they need our help?

503
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:21,812
- We have to find them.
- Wait, wait, what?

504
00:41:21,813 --> 00:41:24,214
- No, but Stoick said...
- It doesn't matter what he said

505
00:41:24,215 --> 00:41:27,184
if they've all been captured.
Come on!

506
00:41:30,487 --> 00:41:33,292
- Do we go back?
- We've nowhere to go...

507
00:41:33,318 --> 00:41:36,827
nothing to sell, and no
heads to call our own.

508
00:41:36,828 --> 00:41:40,431
If we don't turn up with
dragons and fast...

509
00:41:41,966 --> 00:41:44,364
- Careful what you wish for!
- Do something!

510
00:41:44,390 --> 00:41:46,737
- Eret, Son of Eret!
- We'll miss you, Eret!

511
00:41:46,738 --> 00:41:48,906
- What is this?
- A kidnapping.

512
00:41:48,907 --> 00:41:50,441
Yay, can he ride with me? Can he?

513
00:41:50,442 --> 00:41:51,742
Can he...?

514
00:41:53,111 --> 00:41:55,112
You're gonna show us
the way to Drago.

515
00:41:55,113 --> 00:41:59,349
And help Dragon Riders sneak into
Drago's camp? Just kill me now.

516
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:02,119
That could be arranged.
Stormfly, drop it.

517
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,886
Huh?

518
00:42:04,388 --> 00:42:06,056
Good girl!

519
00:42:06,157 --> 00:42:08,793
Stormfly, fetch.

520
00:42:10,095 --> 00:42:14,164
All right! Okay!
I'll take you to Drago!

521
00:42:16,567 --> 00:42:18,901
Works every time.

522
00:42:25,977 --> 00:42:28,479
Hey, I-I thought we
were going to eat.

523
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,446
Oh, we are.

524
00:43:01,044 --> 00:43:04,913
And then, from Dragon Island,
I found this archipelago...

525
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:13,123
There.

526
00:43:14,623 --> 00:43:15,859
Whoa.

527
00:44:05,342 --> 00:44:09,179
Oh, when I'm up here,
I don't even feel the cold.

528
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:12,583
- I just feel...
- Free.

529
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:20,858
This is what it is to
be a dragon, Hiccup.

530
00:44:20,859 --> 00:44:25,894
It's all well and good to call
yourself a dragon, but can you fly?

531
00:44:46,685 --> 00:44:48,551
Oh, no!

532
00:44:58,963 --> 00:45:01,031
Man, almost!

533
00:45:01,432 --> 00:45:03,366
We just about had it that time.

534
00:45:08,239 --> 00:45:10,322
Incredible.

535
00:45:10,348 --> 00:45:12,966
Well, not bad yourself.

536
00:45:22,452 --> 00:45:26,023
All this time, you took after me.

537
00:45:26,324 --> 00:45:30,092
And... where was I?

538
00:45:31,328 --> 00:45:36,665
I'm so sorry, Hiccup.
Can we start over?

539
00:45:39,836 --> 00:45:42,904
Will you give me another chance?

540
00:45:44,574 --> 00:45:50,013
I... I can teach you all that I've
learned these past 20 years.

541
00:45:50,014 --> 00:45:51,714
Like...

542
00:45:56,086 --> 00:45:57,254
Wow.

543
00:45:57,255 --> 00:45:59,823
Now you can make those tight turns.

544
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:04,882
Did you know about this?

545
00:46:05,208 --> 00:46:08,532
Every dragon has its secrets. And...

546
00:46:08,533 --> 00:46:11,067
I'll show them all to you.

547
00:46:11,068 --> 00:46:15,532
We'll unlock every mystery,
find every last species... together,

548
00:46:15,558 --> 00:46:17,575
as mother and son.

549
00:46:22,747 --> 00:46:27,184
This gift we share,
Hiccup, it bonds us.

550
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:31,187
This is who you are, son.

551
00:46:31,213 --> 00:46:32,956
Who we are.

552
00:46:32,957 --> 00:46:36,693
We will change the
world for all dragons.

553
00:46:36,694 --> 00:46:39,696
We will make it a better,
safer place.

554
00:46:39,697 --> 00:46:43,732
Yeah, I mean, that sounds amazing.

555
00:46:55,845 --> 00:47:00,784
Oh, this is so great! Now you and
I can go talk to Drago together.

556
00:47:00,785 --> 00:47:04,388
What? There's no talking to Drago.

557
00:47:04,389 --> 00:47:05,989
- But we have to...
- No.

558
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:08,358
We must protect our own.

559
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:10,994
Come on. We should be getting back.

560
00:47:11,895 --> 00:47:13,262
Hmm?

561
00:47:25,909 --> 00:47:29,313
Okay! I got you here.
Now get this thing off me.

562
00:47:29,314 --> 00:47:32,916
Never take a toy from a dragon.
Don't you know anything?

563
00:47:34,185 --> 00:47:36,719
Why does this keep happening to me?

564
00:47:50,801 --> 00:47:52,768
What's down there?

565
00:47:54,238 --> 00:47:58,986
Large diameter bubbles, massive lungs,
cold water deep dweller,

566
00:47:59,012 --> 00:48:03,346
I'm thinking class five
leviathan, maybe six.

567
00:48:07,996 --> 00:48:09,209
Yah!

568
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:19,729
- Meatlug, what's wrong, girl?
- Come on!

569
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:22,766
- Don't move!
- Uh...

570
00:48:37,814 --> 00:48:39,782
Drago!

571
00:48:43,286 --> 00:48:45,222
Get off me!

572
00:48:46,491 --> 00:48:50,827
Always great to see you, my friend.
Keeping warm up here?

573
00:48:53,864 --> 00:48:58,835
Well, as you can see, I am right on
time with a new batch of dragons,

574
00:48:58,836 --> 00:49:00,237
just like I promised.

575
00:49:00,238 --> 00:49:02,138
- He's waking up!
- Drop the ropes!

576
00:49:02,139 --> 00:49:05,008
- Give me some backup here!
- Watch out!

577
00:49:05,009 --> 00:49:06,810
Drop the ropes.

578
00:49:40,109 --> 00:49:42,812
- Hookfang!
- What are you doing?!

579
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:46,683
You belong to me now.

580
00:49:47,752 --> 00:49:53,215
And as an added bonus, I also caught
you their riders. No extra charge.

581
00:49:53,241 --> 00:49:57,861
- What? Are you kidding me?
- Aw! But you were so perfect!

582
00:49:57,862 --> 00:50:00,397
Turns out there's a whole
bunch of them out there.

583
00:50:00,698 --> 00:50:02,632
They attacked...

584
00:50:02,633 --> 00:50:06,103
- How many?
- Drago doesn't have them after all.

585
00:50:06,104 --> 00:50:09,739
- How many?
- Hundreds. A whole island full.

586
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:11,575
I wouldn't worry about it.

587
00:50:11,576 --> 00:50:14,844
My men are hunting
them down as we speak.

588
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:17,781
They won't know where you're hiding.
I promise you that.

589
00:50:17,782 --> 00:50:22,319
Oh, yes, they will! They know we're
missing, and they have tracking dragons.

590
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:23,619
If you so much as touch us,

591
00:50:23,645 --> 00:50:25,629
- Hiccup is gonna kick...
- Hiccup?

592
00:50:25,655 --> 00:50:28,858
He's not a problem. Really, trust me.

593
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:33,263
He's only the son of Stoick The Vast,
his heir to the throne of Berk,

594
00:50:33,264 --> 00:50:36,766
and the greatest Dragon Master
this world has ever seen.

595
00:50:36,767 --> 00:50:42,472
"Dragon Master"?
I alone control the dragons.

596
00:50:42,473 --> 00:50:43,868
- Nope, mm-mm.
- Sorry!

597
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:50,447
And unless you let us go right now, he
will blast through here on his Night Fury

598
00:50:50,448 --> 00:50:54,017
and blow your entire fleet
of ships to splinters.

599
00:50:54,018 --> 00:50:55,885
Then they'll be crying like babies.

600
00:50:56,735 --> 00:50:58,744
- Funny and beautiful.
- Good one, babe.

601
00:50:58,770 --> 00:51:03,092
Like babies, they always cry.
Real tiny ones.

602
00:51:03,093 --> 00:51:05,428
First there was one rider,

603
00:51:05,429 --> 00:51:07,997
And now all of Berk?

604
00:51:07,998 --> 00:51:10,600
And you led them to me!

605
00:51:12,146 --> 00:51:15,973
- Drago...!
- Stop all preparations!

606
00:51:15,974 --> 00:51:20,210
We must attack the Dragon
Riders' nest at once!

607
00:51:20,211 --> 00:51:23,780
We will take down their Alpha.

608
00:51:23,781 --> 00:51:27,684
Then we will take Berk!

609
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:32,221
- Drago!
- And get rid of him.

610
00:51:32,222 --> 00:51:34,791
Drago, please, I...

611
00:51:39,931 --> 00:51:41,998
Stormfly!

612
00:51:45,603 --> 00:51:47,269
No!

613
00:51:58,781 --> 00:52:03,774
Well, bud... We can't wait around
for Drago to attack this place.

614
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:05,555
We've got to find him first.

615
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:14,864
Let's go.

616
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,501
Easy now.

617
00:52:17,502 --> 00:52:19,769
Are you kidding me?
How did you get in here?

618
00:52:19,770 --> 00:52:21,338
The same way we're getting you out.

619
00:52:21,339 --> 00:52:22,739
- "We"?
- All clear.

620
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:24,707
- Toothless, come.
- Uh, wait, uh, wait...

621
00:52:24,708 --> 00:52:27,366
Okay, uh, Dad, there-there's
something you need to know.

622
00:52:27,392 --> 00:52:28,745
Yeah, yeah, tell me on the way.

623
00:52:28,746 --> 00:52:31,548
Well, this isn't an "on the way"
kind of update, actually.

624
00:52:31,549 --> 00:52:32,649
I've heard enough, Hiccup.

625
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:35,685
More-more of the earth-shattering
development variety.

626
00:52:35,686 --> 00:52:39,222
- Yeah, just add it to pile.
- Yeah, I, uh... uh...

627
00:52:39,223 --> 00:52:44,394
Dad, unlike most surprises I spring on
you, this is one you'll like, I promise.

628
00:52:44,395 --> 00:52:48,198
You just have to handle
it delicately. So...

629
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:50,367
Uh...

630
00:52:50,368 --> 00:52:53,804
You might want to take this one.

631
00:52:53,830 --> 00:52:55,538
Huh?

632
00:52:55,739 --> 00:52:57,340
Oh, boy.

633
00:52:57,341 --> 00:53:02,712
Oh, uh, Dad, could you put
the sword away, please?

634
00:53:14,590 --> 00:53:18,261
I know what you're gonna say, Stoick.

635
00:53:18,262 --> 00:53:21,198
How could I have done this?

636
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:25,702
Stayed away all of these years,
and why didn't I come back to you?

637
00:53:25,703 --> 00:53:27,776
To our son?

638
00:53:27,802 --> 00:53:32,509
Well... what sign did I have
that you could change, Stoick?

639
00:53:32,510 --> 00:53:35,278
That anyone on Berk could?

640
00:53:35,279 --> 00:53:38,749
I pleaded so many times
to stop the fighting,

641
00:53:38,752 --> 00:53:41,718
to find another answer,
but did any of you listen?

642
00:53:41,719 --> 00:53:46,256
This is why I never married.
This, and one other reason.

643
00:53:46,957 --> 00:53:50,594
I know that I left you
to raise Hiccup alone,

644
00:53:50,595 --> 00:53:53,630
but I thought he'd be
better off without me,

645
00:53:53,831 --> 00:53:57,400
and I was wrong.
I see that now, but...

646
00:53:57,401 --> 00:54:01,471
Oh! Stop being so stoic, Stoick.

647
00:54:01,472 --> 00:54:05,908
Go on, shout, scream, say something!

648
00:54:09,946 --> 00:54:13,882
You're as beautiful as
the day I lost you.

649
00:54:47,885 --> 00:54:50,420
- Could this day get any worse?
- Uh, let me see.

650
00:54:50,421 --> 00:54:53,256
We're gonna jump into freezing cold
water and then die from drowning.

651
00:54:53,257 --> 00:54:54,958
Looks refreshing.

652
00:54:55,259 --> 00:54:57,460
Please, ladies first.

653
00:54:58,161 --> 00:54:59,756
You are a steaming...

654
00:54:59,758 --> 00:55:02,131
- heap of dragon...
- Duck.

655
00:55:06,135 --> 00:55:08,938
- Warn the others!
- Get them, you son of an Eret.

656
00:55:11,074 --> 00:55:12,909
Take that!

657
00:55:18,849 --> 00:55:20,583
Okay, I love you again.

658
00:55:20,584 --> 00:55:23,853
Oh, pathetic. You can still jump.

659
00:55:23,854 --> 00:55:26,750
So, are we going to save your
dragons and get out of here or not?

660
00:55:26,776 --> 00:55:27,957
Mm.

661
00:55:27,958 --> 00:55:31,226
Check every trap.
They're here somewhere.

662
00:55:40,469 --> 00:55:42,706
Meatlug?

663
00:55:43,707 --> 00:55:44,841
Anyone coming?

664
00:55:44,842 --> 00:55:47,209
I don't know, you just keep
doing what you're doing.

665
00:55:47,210 --> 00:55:49,778
Keep cranking.

666
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:09,165
Thank you for saving my life.

667
00:56:13,337 --> 00:56:15,872
Now let me return the favor.

668
00:56:16,073 --> 00:56:18,441
Mom, you'd never even recognize it.

669
00:56:18,442 --> 00:56:21,744
Where we used to make weapons,
we now build saddles,

670
00:56:21,745 --> 00:56:24,847
wing slings...
We-we even fix dragon teeth.

671
00:56:24,848 --> 00:56:27,283
You-you wouldn't believe how
much everything's changed.

672
00:56:27,284 --> 00:56:29,786
Aye, your son's changed
Berk for the better.

673
00:56:29,787 --> 00:56:31,654
I think we did well
with this one, Val.

674
00:56:31,655 --> 00:56:32,822
Thanks, Dad.

675
00:56:34,324 --> 00:56:35,658
I got it.

676
00:56:48,005 --> 00:56:51,007
I'm, uh... a little out of practice.

677
00:56:51,008 --> 00:56:55,211
Well, you know, I didn't
marry you for your cooking.

678
00:56:55,212 --> 00:56:59,782
I hope not. Her meatballs could
kill more beasts than a battle ax.

679
00:56:59,783 --> 00:57:02,385
I've still got a few
knocking around in here.

680
00:57:02,386 --> 00:57:05,088
And once you move back
in with all your dragons,

681
00:57:05,089 --> 00:57:07,478
old Drago won't even stand a chance.

682
00:57:07,504 --> 00:57:11,393
- Everything will be okay.
- Slow down, son.

683
00:57:11,394 --> 00:57:13,149
It's a lot to take in.

684
00:57:13,275 --> 00:57:15,422
Oh, gotcha.

685
00:57:23,006 --> 00:57:25,408
Oh, I love this one.

686
00:57:41,424 --> 00:57:43,891
Remember our song, Val?

687
00:57:44,694 --> 00:57:51,635
<i>I'll swim and sail on savage seas</i>

688
00:57:52,536 --> 00:57:57,406
<i>With ne'er a fear of drowning</i>

689
00:57:58,507 --> 00:58:04,645
<i>And gladly ride the waves of life</i>

690
00:58:05,448 --> 00:58:10,285
<i>If you will marry me</i>

691
00:58:12,055 --> 00:58:14,724
<i>No scorching sun</i>

692
00:58:14,725 --> 00:58:17,393
<i>Nor freezing cold</i>

693
00:58:17,694 --> 00:58:22,213
<i>- Will stop...
- Will stop me on my jour... ney</i>

694
00:58:22,214 --> 00:58:23,303
Sorry.

695
00:58:26,304 --> 00:58:32,608
<i>If you will promise me your heart</i>

696
00:58:36,112 --> 00:58:38,880
<i>And love...</i>

697
00:58:43,587 --> 00:58:50,526
<i>And love me for eternity</i>

698
00:58:51,927 --> 00:58:55,932
<i>My dearest one, my darling dear</i>

699
00:58:55,933 --> 00:59:00,103
<i>Your mighty words astound me</i>

700
00:59:00,104 --> 00:59:06,743
<i>But I've no need of mighty deeds
When I feel your arms around me</i>

701
00:59:06,744 --> 00:59:09,378
<i>But I would bring you rings of gold</i>

702
00:59:09,379 --> 00:59:12,164
<i>- I'd even sing you poetry</i>
- Whoo! Oh, would you?

703
00:59:12,190 --> 00:59:16,920
<i>And I would keep you from all harm
If you would stay beside me</i>

704
00:59:16,921 --> 00:59:21,491
<i>I have no use for rings of gold
I care not for your poetry</i>

705
00:59:21,492 --> 00:59:26,062
<i>- I only want your hand to hold
- I only want you near me</i>

706
00:59:26,063 --> 00:59:30,333
<i>To love and kiss, to sweetly hold
For the dancing and the dreaming</i>

707
00:59:30,334 --> 00:59:34,270
<i>Through all my sorrows and delights
I'll keep your laugh inside me</i>

708
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:38,007
<i>I'll swim and sail the savage seas
With ne'er a fear of drowning</i>

709
00:59:38,008 --> 00:59:42,911
<i>And gladly ride the waves of life
If you will marry me...</i>

710
00:59:44,977 --> 00:59:48,217
<i>- I'm still going...</i> I'm done.
- Gobber.

711
00:59:50,487 --> 00:59:53,489
I thought I'd have to die before
we'd have that dance again.

712
00:59:53,490 --> 00:59:56,559
No need for drastic measures.

713
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:59,295
For you, my dear...

714
00:59:59,296 --> 01:00:01,330
anything.

715
01:00:02,231 --> 01:00:05,099
Will you come home, Val?

716
01:00:05,634 --> 01:00:08,972
Will you be my wife once again?

717
01:00:14,478 --> 01:00:17,313
We can be a family! What do you say?

718
01:00:17,314 --> 01:00:18,881
Well...

719
01:00:21,051 --> 01:00:22,919
Yes...

720
01:00:24,654 --> 01:00:26,889
Great! I'll do the cooking.

721
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:31,627
Thank Odin you didn't
listen to me, son.

722
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:33,762
We never would've found each other.

723
01:00:35,132 --> 01:00:37,301
Toothless?

724
01:00:40,570 --> 01:00:42,470
What's happening?

725
01:01:02,091 --> 01:01:04,260
Oh, no...

726
01:01:04,261 --> 01:01:07,864
Val... Val, it's all right,
it's all right.

727
01:01:07,865 --> 01:01:10,733
We're a team now.
Now, what do you want to do?

728
01:01:10,734 --> 01:01:15,504
- We have to save the dragons.
- Aye, you got it. Come on, son!

729
01:01:22,913 --> 01:01:24,547
Reload!

730
01:01:24,548 --> 01:01:26,115
Fire!

731
01:01:30,987 --> 01:01:33,221
Fire! Fire!

732
01:01:38,428 --> 01:01:41,697
Whatever comes,
keep hitting the Mountain.

733
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:44,800
We need to draw the Alpha out.

734
01:01:54,309 --> 01:01:56,112
Ready the traps!

735
01:02:11,368 --> 01:02:14,463
Surprise! Yeah!

736
01:02:14,464 --> 01:02:15,464
What?!

737
01:02:19,837 --> 01:02:24,140
You really are full
of surprises. Let's go.

738
01:02:24,141 --> 01:02:27,208
Dragon Riders coming through!

739
01:02:28,710 --> 01:02:29,978
Fire!

740
01:02:35,084 --> 01:02:36,918
Yeah!

741
01:02:41,624 --> 01:02:44,025
Cut them down!

742
01:02:46,463 --> 01:02:49,130
Eret, Son of Eret!

743
01:02:59,408 --> 01:03:00,977
Up, girl!

744
01:03:00,978 --> 01:03:03,946
Lean left, Eret! That's it!

745
01:03:04,347 --> 01:03:05,913
Look out!

746
01:03:13,656 --> 01:03:15,690
Yeah, baby!

747
01:03:18,961 --> 01:03:20,930
Take them down!

748
01:03:20,931 --> 01:03:22,565
Heads up!

749
01:03:29,972 --> 01:03:31,974
Dragon Master.

750
01:03:32,275 --> 01:03:36,145
- Welcome aboard, Dragon Rider.
- Thanks. I think.

751
01:03:36,146 --> 01:03:40,949
- Where have you been?
- Oh, you know, catching up with Mom.

752
01:03:52,296 --> 01:03:54,030
That's your mother?!

753
01:03:54,031 --> 01:03:57,766
Well, now you know where
I get my dramatic flair.

754
01:04:01,737 --> 01:04:05,641
The Alpha! Now we have a fight!

755
01:04:19,121 --> 01:04:22,858
Come on, Toothless.
Show them what you got, bud.

756
01:04:27,631 --> 01:04:29,130
Attaboy!

757
01:04:41,612 --> 01:04:45,915
- I've waited a long time for this.
- You cannot take our dragons!

758
01:04:46,316 --> 01:04:48,451
They are controlled by the Alpha!

759
01:04:48,452 --> 01:04:51,387
Then it's a good thing
I brought a challenger.

760
01:05:14,411 --> 01:05:16,011
Another one?

761
01:05:16,012 --> 01:05:19,115
That is a class ten! Class ten!

762
01:05:22,886 --> 01:05:26,755
- No... no...
- Come on! Take down the Alpha!

763
01:05:45,606 --> 01:05:49,844
- Thank you.
- For you, my dear... anything.

764
01:05:57,253 --> 01:06:02,024
- Val, do you think you can stop them?
- I'll do my best. Come on, Cloudjumper!

765
01:06:02,525 --> 01:06:03,826
You!

766
01:06:03,827 --> 01:06:05,995
I watched you burn!

767
01:06:05,996 --> 01:06:08,731
It takes more than a
little fire to kill me!

768
01:06:30,787 --> 01:06:32,488
Stoick!

769
01:06:52,975 --> 01:06:54,376
No!

770
01:06:56,646 --> 01:06:58,179
No!

771
01:07:19,468 --> 01:07:22,404
We've won. Now...

772
01:07:22,405 --> 01:07:24,974
- Finish her!
- No!

773
01:07:33,315 --> 01:07:36,584
Hold on! Skullcrusher, go!

774
01:07:36,985 --> 01:07:39,956
- Come on, Gobber!
- Right behind you, Stoick!

775
01:07:59,708 --> 01:08:01,542
Stop!

776
01:08:02,778 --> 01:08:04,546
Stop!

777
01:08:10,286 --> 01:08:14,322
This... is the great Dragon Master?

778
01:08:14,323 --> 01:08:17,826
The son of Stoick The Vast?

779
01:08:18,727 --> 01:08:21,764
What shame he must feel.

780
01:08:22,765 --> 01:08:26,335
All of this loss... and for what?

781
01:08:26,336 --> 01:08:30,439
To become unstoppable?
To rule the world?

782
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:36,311
Dragons, they-they are kind, amazing
creatures that can bring people together.

783
01:08:37,947 --> 01:08:41,016
Or tear them apart.

784
01:08:42,752 --> 01:08:47,956
You see, I know what
it is to live in fear,

785
01:08:47,957 --> 01:08:53,729
to see my village burned,
my family taken.

786
01:08:53,830 --> 01:08:56,565
But even as a boy...

787
01:08:56,566 --> 01:08:59,167
left with nothing,

788
01:08:59,168 --> 01:09:04,071
I vowed to rise above
the fear of dragons...

789
01:09:05,373 --> 01:09:08,344
and liberate the
people of this world.

790
01:09:08,345 --> 01:09:10,646
Then why a dragon army?

791
01:09:10,647 --> 01:09:15,050
Well, you need dragons to
conquer other dragons.

792
01:09:15,051 --> 01:09:18,754
Or maybe you need dragons
to conquer people...

793
01:09:18,755 --> 01:09:21,957
to control those who follow you...

794
01:09:21,958 --> 01:09:24,526
and to get rid of those who won't.

795
01:09:26,829 --> 01:09:28,697
Clever boy.

796
01:09:28,698 --> 01:09:31,333
The world wants peace,

797
01:09:31,334 --> 01:09:35,846
and we have the answer
back on Berk. Just...

798
01:09:35,872 --> 01:09:38,674
- let me show you...
- No!

799
01:09:38,675 --> 01:09:42,478
Let me... show you!

800
01:09:50,320 --> 01:09:51,620
What in...

801
01:09:56,825 --> 01:09:58,093
Hiccup!

802
01:09:58,794 --> 01:10:00,961
Come on, Gobber!

803
01:10:00,987 --> 01:10:03,355
Okay, change of plan.

804
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:08,737
No dragon can resist
the Alpha's command.

805
01:10:08,738 --> 01:10:12,875
So he who controls the Alpha...

806
01:10:12,876 --> 01:10:15,978
controls them all.

807
01:10:19,348 --> 01:10:20,915
Toothless?

808
01:10:26,423 --> 01:10:28,791
Toothless, you okay, bud?
What's going on?

809
01:10:28,792 --> 01:10:31,259
Witness true strength.

810
01:10:32,796 --> 01:10:36,363
The strength of will over others.

811
01:10:41,302 --> 01:10:46,107
In the face of it, you are nothing.

812
01:10:49,912 --> 01:10:52,848
Uh... what did he just tell you?

813
01:10:56,252 --> 01:10:59,755
Toothless, come on.
What's the matter with you?

814
01:10:59,756 --> 01:11:02,958
No, no, no, no, come on,
what are you doing? Knock it off.

815
01:11:03,359 --> 01:11:06,460
Stop! Snap out of it!

816
01:11:12,700 --> 01:11:15,914
Toothless, no! Toothless!

817
01:11:19,609 --> 01:11:21,476
- Don't!
- Hiccup!

818
01:11:22,579 --> 01:11:24,913
- Stop...!
- Son!

819
01:11:24,914 --> 01:11:26,982
Dad! No!

820
01:11:33,655 --> 01:11:35,289
Hmm.

821
01:11:45,969 --> 01:11:47,969
No...

822
01:11:55,178 --> 01:11:56,845
Dad!

823
01:11:57,446 --> 01:11:58,847
Stoick...

824
01:12:02,017 --> 01:12:05,920
Dad? No. You...

825
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:20,067
No.

826
01:12:28,911 --> 01:12:30,811
No, no, no. No.

827
01:12:52,767 --> 01:12:55,036
No! Get away from him!

828
01:12:56,005 --> 01:12:58,339
Go on! Get out of here!

829
01:12:58,840 --> 01:13:00,676
Get away!

830
01:13:01,863 --> 01:13:05,948
It's not his fault. You know that.

831
01:13:11,852 --> 01:13:16,290
<i>Good dragons under the
control of bad people...</i>

832
01:13:16,691 --> 01:13:18,726
<i>do bad things.</i>

833
01:13:38,313 --> 01:13:40,282
Come on!

834
01:13:40,783 --> 01:13:43,118
Gather the men and meet me at Berk!

835
01:13:43,119 --> 01:13:46,688
- Toothless!
- No, don't.

836
01:14:12,214 --> 01:14:18,086
May the Valkyries welcome you and lead
you through Odin's great battlefield.

837
01:14:18,087 --> 01:14:21,256
May they sing your name
with love and fury,

838
01:14:21,257 --> 01:14:25,227
so that we might hear it rise
from the depths of Valhalla,

839
01:14:25,228 --> 01:14:31,000
and know that you've taken your
rightful place at the table of kings.

840
01:14:32,001 --> 01:14:34,569
For a great man has fallen.

841
01:14:35,070 --> 01:14:36,903
A warrior.

842
01:14:36,905 --> 01:14:40,941
A chieftain. A father.

843
01:14:41,610 --> 01:14:43,945
A friend.

844
01:15:17,746 --> 01:15:20,249
I'm sorry, Dad.

845
01:15:32,493 --> 01:15:36,431
I'm not the chief that...
you wanted me to be.

846
01:15:36,432 --> 01:15:40,700
And I'm not the peacekeeper
I thought I was.

847
01:15:42,104 --> 01:15:45,240
I... don't know...

848
01:15:57,685 --> 01:16:02,924
You came early into this world.
You were such a wee thing.

849
01:16:02,925 --> 01:16:06,528
Oh, so frail, so fragile.

850
01:16:06,529 --> 01:16:09,596
I feared you wouldn't make it.

851
01:16:10,899 --> 01:16:13,542
But your father...

852
01:16:13,544 --> 01:16:16,096
he never doubted.

853
01:16:16,272 --> 01:16:21,142
He always said you'd become
the strongest of them all.

854
01:16:21,343 --> 01:16:23,375
And he was right.

855
01:16:24,379 --> 01:16:29,451
You have the heart of a chief,
and the soul of a dragon.

856
01:16:29,452 --> 01:16:33,889
Only you can bring
our worlds together.

857
01:16:34,390 --> 01:16:38,659
That... is who you are, son.

858
01:16:51,807 --> 01:16:54,176
I, uh...

859
01:16:54,177 --> 01:16:58,311
I was so afraid of becoming my dad.

860
01:16:59,180 --> 01:17:02,250
Mostly because I
thought I never could.

861
01:17:02,251 --> 01:17:05,320
How-how do you become someone...

862
01:17:05,321 --> 01:17:07,923
that great, that... brave,

863
01:17:07,924 --> 01:17:10,924
that... selfless?

864
01:17:13,828 --> 01:17:17,497
I guess you can only try.

865
01:17:23,905 --> 01:17:27,507
A chief protects his own.

866
01:17:30,178 --> 01:17:32,045
We're going back.

867
01:17:33,181 --> 01:17:37,185
- Uh... with what?
- Uh, he took all the dragons.

868
01:17:37,186 --> 01:17:39,554
Not all of them.

869
01:17:43,292 --> 01:17:44,626
Whoa!

870
01:17:44,627 --> 01:17:47,963
- Whoa!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

871
01:17:50,299 --> 01:17:52,000
I don't want to die!

872
01:17:52,001 --> 01:17:55,738
- We can't fly these things!
- Yeah, no kidding!

873
01:17:58,707 --> 01:18:02,811
But won't that Bewilderbeast just
take control of these guys, too?

874
01:18:02,812 --> 01:18:05,914
They're babies!
They don't listen to anyone.

875
01:18:05,915 --> 01:18:08,049
Yeah. Just like us.

876
01:18:08,050 --> 01:18:11,619
This is... whoa!... very dangerous!

877
01:18:14,857 --> 01:18:19,227
Some might suggest this
is poorly conceived!

878
01:18:19,228 --> 01:18:21,263
Well, it's a good thing
that I never listen.

879
01:18:21,264 --> 01:18:22,664
Whoa!

880
01:18:22,665 --> 01:18:25,400
So... what is your...

881
01:18:25,401 --> 01:18:26,468
plan?

882
01:18:26,469 --> 01:18:29,637
Get Toothless back
and kick Drago's...

883
01:18:29,638 --> 01:18:31,073
Heads up!

884
01:18:31,574 --> 01:18:33,141
And that thing.

885
01:18:33,142 --> 01:18:35,209
Whoa... ow!

886
01:18:56,632 --> 01:18:59,133
Ah, that's a good boy.

887
01:19:04,573 --> 01:19:07,308
Watch the furniture!

888
01:19:07,309 --> 01:19:09,611
Where are you going?

889
01:19:25,895 --> 01:19:29,130
Your chief... is dead!

890
01:19:29,131 --> 01:19:31,399
- Stoick?
- Not possible!

891
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:34,302
No one can protect you now!

892
01:19:48,984 --> 01:19:50,685
No.

893
01:19:50,686 --> 01:19:53,489
He took all the dragons.

894
01:19:54,490 --> 01:19:58,593
Distract the Alpha. Try to keep
his focus off of Toothless.

895
01:19:58,594 --> 01:20:00,095
Uh, how?

896
01:20:00,096 --> 01:20:02,063
Have you forgotten
who you're riding with?

897
01:20:02,064 --> 01:20:05,100
There isn't a dragon alive
that I can't wrangle!

898
01:20:05,101 --> 01:20:08,270
- Except for this one...!
- Amateur.

899
01:20:09,371 --> 01:20:11,739
Hey, look! It's Hiccup!

900
01:20:17,579 --> 01:20:19,714
What?

901
01:20:33,880 --> 01:20:36,672
- Keep 'em coming!
- Black sheep, baby!

902
01:20:47,409 --> 01:20:49,576
Ten points!

903
01:20:51,146 --> 01:20:52,213
Uh-oh.

904
01:21:03,025 --> 01:21:04,992
I'm okay!

905
01:21:12,301 --> 01:21:15,703
You certainly are hard
to get rid of, I'll say that.

906
01:21:15,704 --> 01:21:18,205
Toothless...

907
01:21:18,206 --> 01:21:19,707
Hey.

908
01:21:19,708 --> 01:21:22,210
It's me, bud.

909
01:21:22,211 --> 01:21:25,980
It's me. It's me.
I'm right here, bud.

910
01:21:25,981 --> 01:21:27,882
Come back to me.

911
01:21:29,218 --> 01:21:34,255
He's not yours anymore.
He belongs to the Alpha.

912
01:21:34,256 --> 01:21:37,825
But, please, o great Dragon Master,

913
01:21:37,826 --> 01:21:40,461
try... to take him.

914
01:21:40,462 --> 01:21:43,798
He will not miss a second time.

915
01:21:43,799 --> 01:21:46,534
It wasn't your fault, bud.

916
01:21:47,503 --> 01:21:50,171
They... made you do it.

917
01:21:59,381 --> 01:22:01,815
You'd never hurt him.

918
01:22:05,954 --> 01:22:08,690
You'd never hurt me.

919
01:22:11,894 --> 01:22:13,862
How are you doing that?

920
01:22:13,863 --> 01:22:17,665
Please. You are my best friend, bud.

921
01:22:21,503 --> 01:22:23,804
My best friend.

922
01:22:28,843 --> 01:22:32,079
Attaboy! That's it! I'm here.

923
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:33,381
No!

924
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:39,520
Yeehaw!

925
01:22:39,921 --> 01:22:41,522
Hang on!

926
01:22:45,794 --> 01:22:47,929
Almost there, buddy, almost there.

927
01:22:57,771 --> 01:22:59,274
Do something!

928
01:22:59,275 --> 01:23:01,341
We need to get those two apart.

929
01:23:11,987 --> 01:23:16,390
We gotta block him out, Toothless.
Do you trust me, bud?

930
01:23:18,193 --> 01:23:20,260
We can do this.

931
01:23:20,261 --> 01:23:24,098
You... and me... as one.

932
01:23:26,801 --> 01:23:30,606
That's it. Now let's try
this one more time!

933
01:23:32,398 --> 01:23:34,408
Take him down, babe!

934
01:23:37,879 --> 01:23:39,446
Go get him.

935
01:23:41,416 --> 01:23:43,383
Take control of it!

936
01:23:45,453 --> 01:23:46,621
Shut it out, Toothless.

937
01:23:46,622 --> 01:23:48,655
- Stop them!
- Now!

938
01:24:11,779 --> 01:24:13,313
Not again.

939
01:24:14,882 --> 01:24:18,051
Toothless, it's now or never!

940
01:24:20,087 --> 01:24:21,556
Come on, bud!

941
01:24:23,559 --> 01:24:24,891
Hold on!

942
01:24:27,362 --> 01:24:29,930
Yeehaw! We did it!

943
01:24:38,307 --> 01:24:40,842
Hold him there, Toothless.

944
01:24:40,843 --> 01:24:42,977
It's all over now.

945
01:24:44,647 --> 01:24:46,580
Or is it?

946
01:24:49,617 --> 01:24:51,852
Oh, no!

947
01:24:59,061 --> 01:25:00,795
No!

948
01:25:02,449 --> 01:25:03,965
No!

949
01:25:11,706 --> 01:25:13,439
Hiccup...

950
01:25:43,872 --> 01:25:47,073
- He's challenging the Alpha!
- To protect you!

951
01:26:12,368 --> 01:26:15,170
No, no, no, no, no! No!

952
01:26:15,571 --> 01:26:19,072
Fight back! Fight! Fight!

953
01:26:21,642 --> 01:26:24,678
What's the matter with you!

954
01:26:33,921 --> 01:26:39,326
Now do you get it? This is what
it is to earn a dragon's loyalty.

955
01:26:40,896 --> 01:26:43,030
Let this end now.

956
01:26:43,031 --> 01:26:45,633
Never! Come on!

957
01:27:08,424 --> 01:27:10,256
Fight!

958
01:27:43,559 --> 01:27:46,427
The Alpha... protects them all.

959
01:28:45,554 --> 01:28:48,689
You never cease to amaze me, bud.

960
01:28:48,990 --> 01:28:51,259
Thank you.

961
01:28:53,529 --> 01:28:56,663
Toothless, you know
that doesn't wash out!

962
01:28:58,065 --> 01:29:00,902
- I knew you'd come back!
- You're back, my beauty!

963
01:29:00,903 --> 01:29:02,236
Oh! Oh!

964
01:29:03,237 --> 01:29:05,271
Stormfly!

965
01:29:07,409 --> 01:29:10,544
Oh, give me a cuddle, grumpy!

966
01:29:10,545 --> 01:29:11,879
Oh!

967
01:29:13,415 --> 01:29:15,316
Who's my little princess!

968
01:29:15,317 --> 01:29:16,818
Don't you ever leave again, Hookfang.

969
01:29:16,819 --> 01:29:19,954
No, you are. Yes, you are.
I missed you...

970
01:29:19,955 --> 01:29:23,089
Oh, Barf... Not you!

971
01:29:25,125 --> 01:29:28,914
That was some pretty fine
dragon-wrangling back there.

972
01:29:28,915 --> 01:29:31,155
You'd make a good trapper. Oh!

973
01:29:32,067 --> 01:29:36,771
You know... Skullcrusher is gonna
need somebody to look after him now.

974
01:29:37,072 --> 01:29:38,704
Me?

975
01:29:42,209 --> 01:29:44,077
I'd be honored.

976
01:29:45,612 --> 01:29:49,683
Your father, he'd be every
bit as proud as I am.

977
01:29:49,684 --> 01:29:53,354
Thank you. I'm really
glad you're here, Mom.

978
01:29:53,355 --> 01:29:55,721
And here I'll stay.

979
01:29:56,957 --> 01:30:00,227
See? I told you it was in here.

980
01:30:00,228 --> 01:30:02,229
Ha, ha, ha.

981
01:30:02,230 --> 01:30:05,733
You're still doing that one.
That's hilarious.

982
01:30:05,734 --> 01:30:08,235
- Come here, you.
- Mm!

983
01:30:08,236 --> 01:30:10,437
Ooh!

984
01:30:39,700 --> 01:30:42,036
The chief has come home!

985
01:30:46,106 --> 01:30:47,340
Yeah!

986
01:30:48,743 --> 01:30:50,911
Long live the chief!

987
01:30:50,912 --> 01:30:55,182
Long live the chief!
Long live the chief!

988
01:30:55,183 --> 01:30:57,351
Long live the chief!

989
01:31:13,868 --> 01:31:16,137
Yah-ha-ha-ha!

990
01:31:20,042 --> 01:31:22,776
<i>This... is Berk.</i>

991
01:31:22,977 --> 01:31:27,314
<i>A bit trampled and busted and
covered in ice, but it's home.</i>

992
01:31:27,315 --> 01:31:29,816
<i>It's our home.</i>

993
01:31:32,953 --> 01:31:36,923
<i>Those who attacked us are
relentless and crazy.</i>

994
01:31:36,924 --> 01:31:41,462
<i>But those who stopped them?
Oh... even more so!</i>

995
01:31:43,832 --> 01:31:47,334
<i>We may be small in numbers,
but we stand for something</i>

996
01:31:47,335 --> 01:31:51,239
<i>bigger than anything the
world can pit against us.</i>

997
01:31:51,740 --> 01:31:54,175
<i>We are the voice of peace.</i>

998
01:31:54,176 --> 01:31:57,644
<i>And bit by bit, we will
change this world.</i>

999
01:32:02,484 --> 01:32:03,883
Wow!

1000
01:32:06,253 --> 01:32:09,023
<i>You see, we have
something they don't.</i>

1001
01:32:09,024 --> 01:32:12,638
<i>Oh, sure, they have armies,
and they have armadas,</i>

1002
01:32:12,639 --> 01:32:16,073
<i>but we... we have...</i>

1003
01:32:17,599 --> 01:32:19,500
<i>Our dragons!</i>
