1
00:00:50,926 --> 00:00:53,010
Nine-ball is rotation pool.

2
00:00:53,637 --> 00:00:56,347
The balls are pocketed
in numbered order.

3
00:00:56,932 --> 00:01:00,727
The only ball that means anything,
that wins it, is the nine.

4
00:01:01,937 --> 00:01:05,481
Now the player can shoot
eight trick shots in a row,

5
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:07,817
blow the nine and lose.

6
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:12,739
On the other hand, the player can
get the nine in on the break,

7
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,825
if the balls spread right, and win.

8
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:20,872
Which is to say that
luck plays a part in nine-ball.

9
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:24,584
But for some players,

10
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:29,630
luck itself is an art.

11
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,188
Color.

12
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:13,484
Check the color. Dead giveaway, huh?

13
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:17,071
It's so thick you can almost feel it.

14
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:21,117
Lay down and just let it roll over you.

15
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:24,036
That's single malt.

16
00:03:25,581 --> 00:03:29,041
Then on the other hand,
you got something like Old McDonnell.

17
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:31,168
More like Young McDonnell.

18
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:34,046
Tastes like six-year-old bonded.

19
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:37,008
Smell this.

20
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:39,343
Mmm.

21
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:40,636
Hmm?

22
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,687
- That's good stuff.
- Yeah.

23
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,149
Very good stuff.

24
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:56,068
I can get you a case of this
for $35.50 less

25
00:03:56,153 --> 00:03:59,030
than your wholesaler will give you
a case of Jack Daniel's.

26
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:01,574
$45.50 less than he can get you
a case of Wild Turkey.

27
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:04,744
Why don't you go peddle that
to one of your hotel chains?

28
00:04:05,287 --> 00:04:06,495
Peddle?

29
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:10,166
I don't do that. Do I do that?
I mean, this is family.

30
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:12,293
I'm glad to see you, too.

31
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:15,504
Come to my house tonight
and I'll make you an omelet.

32
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:18,549
- I make the omelets.
- Okay, you make the omelets.

33
00:04:18,634 --> 00:04:20,176
Did you forget the omelet
I made you last time?

34
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:21,761
No, I didn't forget.

35
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:24,096
Yeah, what was it? What was in it?

36
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:26,098
Eddie.
- Sweet sausage.

37
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:28,017
Sweet sausage? Hey.

38
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,728
I never made you sweet sausage.
Who the hell made you sweet sausage?

39
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:32,521
Eddie.

40
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:34,357
Come on, what was in it?

41
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:35,775
- Uh, um...
- Sour...

42
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:38,027
Sour cream and caviar, right?

43
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,987
Okay. Excuse me.

44
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:43,741
- Eddie.
- Aw, Julian, what am I doing here?

45
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:46,035
- Am I working?
- I'm working, too.

46
00:04:46,328 --> 00:04:49,747
- I got this guy, he's up to 20 a rack.
- What guy?

47
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:58,756
Been playing two and a half hours
for five a game. He's up 30.

48
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,424
- So?
- So I've been playing him off.

49
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:02,051
That's what is up.

50
00:05:06,098 --> 00:05:07,848
Yo, Vincent!

51
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:10,476
Vincent, we're on!

52
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:13,729
Hey, Vincent!

53
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:16,649
Can you believe this guy?

54
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:19,610
Hey, Vinny.

55
00:05:19,695 --> 00:05:23,572
I mean, you slide some of this stuff into
a bottle of Old Grand-Dad, Wild Turkey,

56
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:26,659
you'd hardly be lying. Don't even
need iodine. It's a beautiful bourbon.

57
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:28,703
- Pick me up at 10:00.
- What?

58
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,746
I get off at 10:00.

59
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:33,207
Not without me, you don't. Do you?

60
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:38,129
Wait a minute. Come on.
I'm talking bourbon. Okay.

61
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:39,755
You know the secret?

62
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:43,009
These people, they get a hold
of aged kegs. What are you tasting?

63
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:46,554
Tasting low fusel oil content,
low acidic content.

64
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:48,889
Just like the big guys,
honey, it's the kegs.

65
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:52,518
Where do you get the kegs?
You don't just get kegs like that, Eddie.

66
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:53,728
Hey!

67
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:55,938
That was fast. What the hell happened?

68
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:57,356
I slipped.

69
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,443
- He slipped.
- Yeah.

70
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:03,571
Where do they get the kegs?

71
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:05,281
They just do. That's all.

72
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:07,241
Okay, listen, do whatever
you want to do.

73
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:09,118
It's gonna leave the warehouse
one way or the other.

74
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:11,078
Come on.
On the snap, Vincent!

75
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:15,374
That kid has got
a sledge-hammer break!

76
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,962
One more night

77
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,756
Bottoms up.

78
00:06:22,758 --> 00:06:24,633
- Do you know who loves this stuff?
- Who?

79
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:27,636
- The Chinese.
- It must be the low fusel oil content.

80
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:29,847
Don't kid yourself. It has its effect.

81
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:32,224
It's just like one of those things
that you never think about,

82
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:35,561
but it can make your day, like electricity.

83
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:40,066
- Eddie, throw me another 20.
- Who are you working, me or him?

84
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:43,319
He's on the ropes, Eddie.
He just lucked out.

85
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:45,112
You know me, right?

86
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:47,448
Take it easy.

87
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:57,124
Victory!

88
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:04,048
Maybe you're not alone

89
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:08,511
Pick us out a nice bottle of wine
for tonight, will you?

90
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:09,845
Red or white?

91
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,972
Come on. On the snap, Vincent!

92
00:07:13,475 --> 00:07:15,935
One more night

93
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:18,938
'Cause I can't wait forever

94
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:21,524
- Eddie, about those labels.
- Yeah.

95
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:23,901
Can you get me
some Wild Turkey labels?

96
00:07:25,237 --> 00:07:26,362
Sure.

97
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:30,157
Oh, one more night

98
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:33,702
'Cause I can't wait forever

99
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:37,289
Give me one more night

100
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,709
Give me just one more night

101
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:44,130
Give me one more night

102
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:47,508
I can't wait forever

103
00:07:47,676 --> 00:07:49,677
Hiya. How are you doing?

104
00:07:50,554 --> 00:07:52,930
Like a river to the sea

105
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,684
I will always be with you

106
00:07:57,727 --> 00:08:00,729
And if you sail away

107
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:03,357
I will follow you

108
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:07,153
Give me one more night

109
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:09,822
Give me just one more night

110
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:12,116
The kid draws some bead, huh?

111
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:17,705
I can't wait forever

112
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:22,668
I know there'll never be a time

113
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:24,628
You'll ever feel the same

114
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:27,464
Play him again, Julian.
You really got him on the ropes.

115
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:29,466
One more, right, chief?

116
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:31,093
Eddie, I got to split.

117
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:34,096
- You're going?
- I got to see somebody.

118
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:36,515
Oh, come on, one more game.

119
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:38,976
- I'm bust.
- So let's just play, play.

120
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:42,146
- What?
- Let's play for play. No money.

121
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:46,192
Play, play?

122
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:49,111
- Show me what you got here.
- Vincent!

123
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:51,030
Hey, Julian, I just want your best game.

124
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:54,200
I think maybe the money was
what's throwing you off here today.

125
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:05,044
Okay, how about I win, no money.
You win, I'll throw you 20.

126
00:09:09,633 --> 00:09:10,633
No?

127
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:19,058
What's the matter with this guy?

128
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,810
All right, Carmen, who's next?

129
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:22,937
Nobody?

130
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:26,982
Hey, excuse me.
Do you want to play me?

131
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:29,235
For your girlfriend?

132
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:31,654
No. One game.

133
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:34,031
I'll spot you the seven and nine.

134
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:35,658
The seven, eight and nine.

135
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:37,576
I'll give you the table.

136
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:40,496
You want to play him?

137
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:42,164
Me?

138
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:44,208
Sure.

139
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:47,836
- Twenty a rack.
- No, 500 a rack.

140
00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:51,507
What? Are you serious?

141
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:54,969
I never kid about money.

142
00:09:57,222 --> 00:10:00,516
Cowards! Off with their heads.

143
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:07,064
You don't know what you're doing,
do you?

144
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:09,400
What do you mean?

145
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:11,443
You just blew 500 bucks.

146
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:15,656
That kid, he has both arms in traction,
he beats anybody in the room.

147
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:19,785
Yeah, he could.

148
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:24,581
So I'll offer to you again,
I'll play him for 500 bucks.

149
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:28,585
You don't know what to say, do you?

150
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:31,297
Maybe I'm hustling you,
maybe I'm not, you don't know.

151
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:32,589
But you should know.

152
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:34,341
See, if you know that,
you know when to say yes,

153
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:35,843
you know when to say no.

154
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:38,804
Everybody goes home in a limousine.

155
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,389
So what should I say, yes or no?

156
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,057
You should say no.

157
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:48,063
You know why? 'Cause it's too much
money, and I'm an unknown.

158
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:50,566
He should be the unknown.

159
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:53,527
I mean, that would be nice.

160
00:10:54,738 --> 00:10:58,991
That would be beautiful. You could play
around with that, you can control that.

161
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,743
You know what I mean?

162
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,955
I'll offer it to you again.
I'll play him for 500 bucks.

163
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:06,707
No.

164
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:10,627
Actually, you should have said yes.

165
00:11:10,712 --> 00:11:12,963
But how are you gonna know that?
I mean, it's very hard to know that,

166
00:11:13,048 --> 00:11:14,465
it's very complex.

167
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:16,759
It's like, "Which twin has got the Toni?"

168
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:18,427
Maybe they both got the Toni.

169
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,512
Maybe Toni's a guy.
Maybe Toni's bald, you know.

170
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:22,097
How you gonna know that?
It's very complicated.

171
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:23,849
Plus, it's too much money.

172
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:27,728
- Jesus, you're crazy!
- No, I'm not. Just common sense.

173
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:34,109
How about I take you guys out
for dinner tonight?

174
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:40,449
- You should ask Vincent.
- No, you should ask Vincent.

175
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:52,836
You know the last time
Julian lost for me?

176
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:55,130
It's just a game, man.
Some balls and a stick.

177
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:57,966
Balls and a stick. This is Vincent.

178
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:00,969
Nine-ball's not that tough.
Do you wanna know what's tough?

179
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:02,805
- Stocker.
- Stocker?

180
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:04,139
It's his video game.

181
00:12:04,516 --> 00:12:06,558
- Vincent's the best at it.
- I'm the best at it.

182
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:08,560
I mean, in pool, you just got these balls,

183
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:11,397
you're just sitting there,
you take your time, you set up the shot.

184
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:12,731
But Stocker!

185
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:15,192
Can you make any money
playing Stocker?

186
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:18,946
I'll tell you what I can do off Stocker.

187
00:12:19,114 --> 00:12:20,572
Ten years from now,
I can get into West Point.

188
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:22,449
That's what I can do with Stocker.

189
00:12:22,534 --> 00:12:24,993
It's all coming down
to video game reflexes.

190
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:28,247
I mean, uh, computerized tanks,
Star Wars, you know, that movie.

191
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:31,250
I mean, 10 years from now,
a guy who scores heavy on Stocker

192
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:33,168
is a shoo-in at the Point.

193
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:36,046
You are beautiful.

194
00:12:36,548 --> 00:12:39,633
- You don't believe me?
- What do you mean, money?

195
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:43,053
- Money, money.
- Really?

196
00:12:43,847 --> 00:12:45,013
Hey, look.

197
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:47,683
If you got an area of excellence,

198
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:50,853
if you're good at something,
you're the best at something, anything,

199
00:12:51,062 --> 00:12:54,189
then rich can be arranged.
I mean, rich can come fairly easy.

200
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:56,108
- Really?
- Yeah.

201
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:59,445
You have some other area of excellence
besides this Stocker?

202
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:01,780
Nine-ball, right?

203
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:05,200
- You're some piece of work.
- I'm some piece of work.

204
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:06,618
You're also a natural character.

205
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:09,496
I've been telling her that.
You know, I got natural character.

206
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:11,874
No, that's not what I said, kid.

207
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:16,295
I said you are a natural character.
You're an incredible flake.

208
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,089
But that's a gift.

209
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:23,343
See, guys spend half their lives
trying to invent something like that.

210
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:26,263
You walk into a poolroom
with that "go, go, go,"

211
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:29,141
the guys will be killing each other
trying to get to you.

212
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:32,186
You got that.

213
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:35,272
But I'll tell you something, kiddo.

214
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:38,650
You couldn't find big time
if you had a road map.

215
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:42,404
Pool excellence is not
about excellent pool.

216
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,531
It's about becoming something.

217
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:46,533
Yeah?

218
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,744
Yeah.

219
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,956
- Like what?
- A student.

220
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:55,751
You got to be a student
of human moves.

221
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,504
See, all the greats that I know of,
to a man,

222
00:13:58,588 --> 00:14:00,214
were students of human moves.

223
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:04,384
- Students of human moves?
- Yeah.

224
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:07,095
That's my area of excellence.

225
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:09,139
Oh, yeah?

226
00:14:10,225 --> 00:14:11,350
Yeah.

227
00:14:13,937 --> 00:14:17,814
What?

228
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:19,107
Okay.

229
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:21,777
That guy at the end of the bar
in a black suit.

230
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:26,114
He's been hustling that broad
for half an hour.

231
00:14:26,241 --> 00:14:29,409
He's going to throw in the towel
in 30 seconds for a buck.

232
00:14:30,745 --> 00:14:32,955
You got it, starting now.

233
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:35,749
Ten seconds.

234
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,626
What do you mean,
rich could be arranged?

235
00:14:38,253 --> 00:14:39,253
Ssh!

236
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:44,883
...25, 26, 27, 28. Guess the news.

237
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,718
You lose.

238
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:51,598
Ah. And I just missed it
by a couple of seconds.

239
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:54,101
Want to up the bet?

240
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:56,061
Yeah.

241
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:00,649
Check for the meal says
I leave with her in two minutes.

242
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:08,031
Okay, ready, go. Now! I'm counting.

243
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:14,955
I know this is going to sound crazy,
but would you come outside

244
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:17,082
and take a look at my car?

245
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:19,960
- Your car?
- Yeah.

246
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,172
Come on.

247
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:29,928
Hold it here for a second, will you?

248
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:41,023
Human moves, kid.
You study the watch.

249
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:44,943
But I study you. You get the check.

250
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:47,237
Excuse me.

251
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:51,867
Cab's on me.

252
00:15:57,665 --> 00:16:01,752
- What's with the car, Eddie?
- Nothing. I'll drive you home.

253
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:06,173
I just hated to see you sitting alone
at the bar, Diane. It's just depressing.

254
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:09,051
- Did you see Jimmy in there?
- Yeah, I saw him.

255
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,762
Does he still got his nighttime job?

256
00:16:12,013 --> 00:16:14,973
He wanted to talk to you
about something, but you were busy.

257
00:16:15,058 --> 00:16:16,058
Oh, yeah.

258
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:21,355
Where'd you go?

259
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:23,774
What?

260
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,276
You certainly weren't here.

261
00:16:27,737 --> 00:16:29,446
Yeah? Where was I?

262
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:34,451
God, the earth moved.

263
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:37,037
Didn't it move for you a little bit?

264
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:38,872
That was a train.

265
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:43,168
No, it was you.

266
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:49,716
But it certainly wasn't San Juan.

267
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:54,388
You want to talk earth moving,
you got to talk San Juan.

268
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,932
Remember that water bed we had?

269
00:16:58,601 --> 00:16:59,643
Gosh!

270
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:03,188
Sometimes I think about that week,

271
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:05,899
you know, Eddie,
when I'm behind the bar, I think...

272
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:09,152
I think,
"I'm gonna go and get me a water bed

273
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:12,614
"and not tell anybody,
just make it a surprise.

274
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:18,453
"Get some rum and pineapple juice."

275
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:24,376
You couldn't tell me one word
I just said, could you?

276
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:26,712
No, I couldn't.

277
00:17:27,922 --> 00:17:29,923
Water bed, rum, pineapple juice.

278
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:32,175
It's not that. It's...

279
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:36,138
I don't know. That kid today.

280
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:40,267
It was like watching home movies.

281
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:45,021
It just made me wonder.

282
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:46,982
Wonder what?

283
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:51,903
Made me wonder about San Juan.

284
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,836
What did you mean last night
about money and all that stuff?

285
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:13,216
Come here,
I want to show you something.

286
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,446
- So this is liquor money, huh?
- Some.

287
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:37,866
I invest. Do you know what I invest in?

288
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:39,743
Excellence.

289
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:45,332
- You think Vincent's that good?
- Well...

290
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,876
He's got the eye, he's got the stroke.

291
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:50,212
He's got the flake.
He's got that down cold.

292
00:18:50,922 --> 00:18:53,465
But can he flake on and flake off,
I don't know.

293
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:56,384
See, I don't know whether that
can be taught. That's not clear.

294
00:18:56,469 --> 00:19:00,180
He's got to learn how to be himself,
but on purpose.

295
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:04,017
- Yeah.
- You like to travel?

296
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,478
- Yeah.
- You like hotels?

297
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:08,772
Yeah, sure, they're okay.

298
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:11,483
Are you gonna help me with him?

299
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:19,074
That lady you picked up
last night in the bar.

300
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:21,952
You knew her from before, right?

301
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,163
Hmm?

302
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:26,957
And the guy?

303
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,084
You probably had his schedule
down cold, right?

304
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:32,629
Maybe he works around here
somewhere, he's your brother-in-law?

305
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:34,464
You're a hard broad.

306
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,092
What does Vincent see in you?

307
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:41,429
Vincent's the best.
That's what he sees in me.

308
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:44,766
We've just been together
for about a year.

309
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:47,018
And Vincent made us
get a place together.

310
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,938
You know how we met?

311
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:56,236
My old boyfriend last year got busted
breaking into Vincent's parents' house.

312
00:19:56,988 --> 00:19:59,197
We met at the police station,
me and Vincent.

313
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:01,032
You were bailing him out,
your boyfriend?

314
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:04,494
No. No, no, no. I got busted, too.
I was driving the car.

315
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:06,955
See this?

316
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,461
- Vincent's mother's.
- He gave that to you?

317
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:14,713
No.

318
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:17,883
From the robbery.

319
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:20,302
Vince says his mother
has one just like it.

320
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:24,139
He's sweet.

321
00:20:25,975 --> 00:20:27,851
Vincent's real sweet.

322
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,157
Do you want something
for your kid to bounce in?

323
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,409
What country comes to mind when
you think of bouncing? What animal?

324
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:45,493
A kangaroo.

325
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:46,620
Comes from where?
Australia.

326
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:49,706
That's right, this is Australian-made.
I'll be perfectly honest with you.

327
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:53,793
It's twice as expensive, but it's three
times better than Taiwan over here.

328
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,004
I'll throw you $15 off on this.

329
00:20:57,298 --> 00:20:59,257
- Yeah, okay.
- Yeah, we'll do it.

330
00:20:59,342 --> 00:21:01,635
All right, Mr. and Mrs. Randall.
It's a good buy.

331
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:04,387
Hey, Lou, could you write them up?
Australia, $15 off, all right?

332
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:05,472
Thank you.

333
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:07,682
If you ever need anything,
Vincent, okay?

334
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:09,351
- Okay.
- Okay. Thanks.

335
00:21:10,353 --> 00:21:12,812
Mr. Felson, what can I do you for here?

336
00:21:12,897 --> 00:21:14,856
Uh, Eddie is okay.

337
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:17,233
In fact, just plain Ed, if you want.

338
00:21:17,485 --> 00:21:18,485
Yes, sir.

339
00:21:19,487 --> 00:21:22,197
Me and you, is there someplace private
we can talk?

340
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:28,286
There's gonna be a nine-ball
tournament end ofApril, Atlantic City.

341
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:31,831
There will be lot of action there.
I think we ought to go.

342
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:34,417
- We?
- Yeah, me, you and Carmen.

343
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:36,127
Yeah?

344
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,879
That sounds like a lot of fun.

345
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:40,048
The best part is,
we gotta leave tomorrow.

346
00:21:40,174 --> 00:21:42,384
Tomorrow? Why not leave today?

347
00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:46,262
What is it with this guy?
You crack me up.

348
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:48,014
Vincent,
if you're gonna take the plunge,

349
00:21:48,099 --> 00:21:49,724
give yourself a fair shake.

350
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:53,228
Now, you go at this thing half-assed,
nobody is going to do any good.

351
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,063
Go on the road, six weeks.

352
00:21:55,356 --> 00:21:57,565
Get some seasoning.
Put together some stuff.

353
00:21:58,234 --> 00:21:59,985
Why don't you ask Julian?
I mean, he'd be into that, right?

354
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:01,319
Julian is a face. He's known.

355
00:22:01,404 --> 00:22:03,738
You're nobody.
I get better bets with you.

356
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:06,783
Now, if you know some other way that
I can be honest with you,

357
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:08,576
you got to tell me.

358
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:11,746
This is my job, Eddie.

359
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:13,623
You think so?

360
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:15,583
Hmm.

361
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:18,920
That's funny, I don't think so.
I think it's your problem.

362
00:22:21,215 --> 00:22:22,173
What is?

363
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:25,093
Well, you're hooked on Carmen,
aren't you?

364
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:28,596
Yeah.

365
00:22:28,723 --> 00:22:30,306
Crazy about her?

366
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:34,436
You're getting a little personal here.

367
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:41,151
What?

368
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:43,486
You're losing her, kiddo.

369
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,238
What do you mean?

370
00:22:45,573 --> 00:22:48,033
She don't get the allure of this place.

371
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:50,118
- Hey, Vincent!
- Wait.

372
00:22:50,661 --> 00:22:53,204
- What?
- Take a good look at her, Vincent.

373
00:22:53,414 --> 00:22:55,290
She's starting to pack.

374
00:22:59,253 --> 00:23:00,211
You don't know her.

375
00:23:00,296 --> 00:23:02,964
I didn't know that broad
at that bar last night, either.

376
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:05,008
She's bored, Vincent.

377
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:07,177
Are you listening to
what I'm telling you?

378
00:23:07,261 --> 00:23:08,261
Vincent!

379
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:11,389
So what are you saying?

380
00:23:11,474 --> 00:23:15,101
What I'm saying?
You, me, her, on the road, six weeks.

381
00:23:15,853 --> 00:23:17,729
She'll be a couple of years
catching her breath.

382
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:19,439
Vincent, you know,
these people got a babysitter.

383
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:21,524
Hey, look,
can't you see I'm talking here?

384
00:23:21,609 --> 00:23:23,818
Do me a favor, will you?
Take care of them!

385
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:26,905
He's leaving, his coffee break.

386
00:23:28,282 --> 00:23:31,076
Go on, get back to work.
But think about it.

387
00:23:31,619 --> 00:23:33,661
Okay. Take your time.

388
00:23:34,038 --> 00:23:37,123
- I'll give you about five seconds.
- Five seconds.

389
00:23:38,334 --> 00:23:40,668
Listen, you know where to find me,
if you want to talk.

390
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:42,629
Vincent.

391
00:23:43,464 --> 00:23:45,006
Don't worry about it.

392
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:01,648
If I could hold you tonight
I might never let go

393
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:03,942
Anybody asks, I'll be in the back.

394
00:24:04,193 --> 00:24:06,861
If I could hold you tonight
I might never let go

395
00:24:10,116 --> 00:24:11,366
Come on in.

396
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:18,498
Hey, Eddie.

397
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:25,421
Uh, I don't know... What we were
talking about yesterday, I just...

398
00:24:25,506 --> 00:24:27,465
I wanted to ask you some questions
about it.

399
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:30,009
Uh, what happens, you know?

400
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:33,012
What happens exactly?

401
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:40,103
Damn.

402
00:24:41,105 --> 00:24:42,772
It's a Balabushka.

403
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:44,899
It's beautiful.

404
00:24:46,152 --> 00:24:48,570
It makes the other ones
look like stickball bats.

405
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:50,780
- Is this yours?
- You want it?

406
00:24:51,574 --> 00:24:54,450
No. I can't. This isn't for me.

407
00:24:54,535 --> 00:24:56,911
I don't know who this is for. This is a...

408
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:01,916
No, this isn't for me.
I don't know.

409
00:25:02,376 --> 00:25:05,503
John Wayne would carry something
like this if he played pool, you know.

410
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:07,755
Babe Ruth.

411
00:25:08,424 --> 00:25:09,424
Oh, my.

412
00:25:11,719 --> 00:25:14,262
No, I can't accept this.

413
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:16,055
Go ahead. Take it.

414
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:22,103
- You're pushing pretty hard.
- You betcha.

415
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:25,940
I've been thinking
about nothing else all day.

416
00:25:31,322 --> 00:25:34,949
- I don't know what to tell you, Eddie.
- Whatever. It doesn't matter.

417
00:25:35,284 --> 00:25:38,077
Go outside. Horse around with it.
If you don't like it, bring it back.

418
00:25:44,126 --> 00:25:45,793
Eddie, hey, Eddie.

419
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:50,924
Uh, you know, I was talking to Carmen
the other night, feeling her out.

420
00:25:51,008 --> 00:25:53,551
Willie. Sorry, hold... Wait a minute.

421
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:55,845
Sorry, go ahead.

422
00:25:58,015 --> 00:26:00,308
I said I was talking to Carmen
the other night, feeling her out.

423
00:26:00,643 --> 00:26:03,269
You know, uh,
I think you're wrong, man.

424
00:26:04,146 --> 00:26:06,898
She's doing good.
She's doing real good.

425
00:26:07,024 --> 00:26:09,359
Okay. I'm glad I'm wrong.

426
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:11,236
Willie.

427
00:26:13,322 --> 00:26:14,572
No, I know.

428
00:26:14,657 --> 00:26:18,701
I can make it in half an hour,
45 minutes, something like that. Sure.

429
00:26:35,261 --> 00:26:37,553
Where's Carmen, my girlfriend?

430
00:26:37,888 --> 00:26:39,931
- She just went in the bathroom.
- Bathroom?

431
00:26:40,474 --> 00:26:42,183
You know what this is?

432
00:26:42,518 --> 00:26:44,018
Balabushka.

433
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:46,854
- Balabushka?
- Yeah.

434
00:26:46,981 --> 00:26:50,191
- Where did you get a Balabushka?
- Eddie Felson gave it to me.

435
00:26:50,526 --> 00:26:52,819
- Eddie Felson gave you a Balabushka?
- Yeah.

436
00:26:55,364 --> 00:26:56,990
It's a pretty good gift.
You know what that's worth?

437
00:26:57,074 --> 00:26:58,199
Yeah.

438
00:26:59,368 --> 00:27:02,370
That guy died about 10 or 15 years ago.
It's gotta be a collector's item by now.

439
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:03,496
Yeah.

440
00:27:47,708 --> 00:27:49,000
It's my word against yours, right?

441
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:51,210
I'm a middle-aged Jewish man.
I'm a rare book expert.

442
00:27:51,295 --> 00:27:53,880
- Have you seen my girlfriend, Julian?
- She went out.

443
00:27:53,964 --> 00:27:56,841
- Out where?
- She's your girlfriend, man.

444
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,801
Where was I?

445
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:02,847
Hey.

446
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:06,351
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

447
00:28:06,477 --> 00:28:08,686
- Where did you go?
- Went out to get cigs.

448
00:28:09,313 --> 00:28:10,980
They sell cigarettes right here.

449
00:28:11,065 --> 00:28:13,024
So I went across the street to get them.
So what?

450
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:16,402
You needed some fresh air, right?

451
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:19,030
What's your problem?

452
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:23,076
No problem. Did I say I had a problem?
There's no problem.

453
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,911
I'm glad to hear it.

454
00:28:24,995 --> 00:28:27,538
I just didn't know where you went.
I was looking for you.

455
00:28:28,374 --> 00:28:30,541
I'm going to sit down now. Is that okay?

456
00:28:30,626 --> 00:28:32,001
Yeah.

457
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:35,171
I might go to the bathroom again
in about a half hour. Is that okay?

458
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:38,591
- That's great, Carmen.
- I'll be sure and tell you when, okay?

459
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:42,303
Hey, look, I just didn't know
where you went, all right?

460
00:28:42,388 --> 00:28:43,388
Come on.

461
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:46,808
I was looking for you. Let's not make
a federal production out of this, okay.

462
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:48,101
Okay!

463
00:28:48,811 --> 00:28:49,977
Okay.

464
00:28:54,817 --> 00:28:57,360
- It's a Balabushka. Eddie gave it to me.
- Great.

465
00:29:42,406 --> 00:29:46,284
Eddie, uh, I've been thinking about it.

466
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:49,537
- Let's do it, okay?
- Great.

467
00:30:02,676 --> 00:30:05,219
- I wonder what's upstairs.
- Why?

468
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:10,850
Well, there might be something soft
for you to lean against.

469
00:30:12,436 --> 00:30:14,937
So I don't crush your skirt.

470
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:24,363
What do
they do in the Bahamas?

471
00:30:24,448 --> 00:30:26,115
Do they tango or rumba?

472
00:30:26,283 --> 00:30:27,867
Samba, I think.

473
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:33,372
How's that Old McDonnell working out?

474
00:30:34,124 --> 00:30:36,792
- You're drinking it now.
- You serious?

475
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:40,588
- Good stuff.
- It's very good stuff.

476
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:43,049
Yo, Eddie. My man, hey!

477
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:46,010
Why don't you look in the mirror
before you leave the john, huh?

478
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:48,054
I hate that shit.

479
00:30:50,724 --> 00:30:52,683
Better than that shit.

480
00:30:53,602 --> 00:30:54,977
Hey, listen, Eddie.
You gonna be around Monday?

481
00:30:55,062 --> 00:30:56,354
There's a guy I got set up in Camden.

482
00:30:56,438 --> 00:30:59,315
No, I'm gonna be out of town
for a couple of weeks.

483
00:31:00,317 --> 00:31:01,734
Bullshit.

484
00:31:02,528 --> 00:31:04,320
What? You're taking that guy
on the road? What's his name?

485
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:06,030
I don't know his name.
It's none of your business.

486
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:07,615
That guy is a chump.

487
00:31:07,783 --> 00:31:10,701
What did he do? Beat me one night.
I put the nine ball up both your asses.

488
00:31:10,786 --> 00:31:12,954
Are you serious, taking him on the road?

489
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:15,373
When was the last time
you did the road? 1960?

490
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:18,000
They didn't even have cars then.

491
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:20,211
What?

492
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:24,298
Come on. You banging his girlfriend?
Right?

493
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,384
You can tell me.

494
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:29,428
Jesus, you are the best, Julian.

495
00:31:29,513 --> 00:31:31,138
Let me play him again tonight.

496
00:31:31,348 --> 00:31:34,892
- Winner gets in the car with you.
- No, you're the best, Julian.

497
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:38,062
You're not the only stakehorse around,
you know that?

498
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:40,273
See you in Atlantic City, okay?

499
00:31:40,357 --> 00:31:42,650
Don't look too hard for me, okay?

500
00:31:47,197 --> 00:31:50,157
Hey, we are going to the Bahamas.
I just didn't say when.

501
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:52,326
I appreciate hearing about it
from that dope fiend.

502
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:53,786
I didn't want to tell anybody.

503
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,621
What if I get on the road
and the kid doesn't work out?

504
00:31:55,706 --> 00:31:57,248
It makes me feel great, Eddie, great.

505
00:31:57,374 --> 00:32:00,042
That guy sucks, man, and so do you!

506
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:02,253
All right, I am wrong! Uh-huh.

507
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:03,421
But let me do it my way.

508
00:32:03,505 --> 00:32:04,839
Do it any way you want to do it, Eddie.

509
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:07,425
What I want is, I just want to go
on the road, I don't wanna tell anybody!

510
00:32:07,509 --> 00:32:09,552
Fine! If you got anything that
you need at my apartment,

511
00:32:09,678 --> 00:32:11,679
you'll find it in a suitcase
out front, okay?

512
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:14,515
Hey, wait a...

513
00:32:18,687 --> 00:32:19,895
I'm sorry.

514
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:25,693
I cover all expenses. Food, room,
everything, entry fees, everything.

515
00:32:25,986 --> 00:32:29,322
For that, I get 60% of everything
you win, all bets.

516
00:32:29,698 --> 00:32:32,158
I lay the bets,
so I also take the losses if you lose.

517
00:32:32,242 --> 00:32:34,285
So for that I get 60% of what you win.

518
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:37,163
60%? What are you, a slumlord?

519
00:32:37,247 --> 00:32:39,957
Honey, you find a newcomer
with a better deal than that,

520
00:32:40,042 --> 00:32:41,626
you come to me, we talk.

521
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:44,587
Don't worry. I'm not going to lose often.

522
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:48,007
Oh, yes, you will.
That's what I'm gonna teach you.

523
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:51,886
Sometimes if you lose, you win. Go.

524
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,346
So who's the heaviest guy?

525
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:56,140
What do you ask that for?
I'm the heaviest guy. Right, Eddie?

526
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:58,684
Aw. It doesn't make any sense.
It goes in streaks.

527
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:01,479
The balls roll funny
for everybody, kiddo.

528
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:03,314
There is this guy, Grady Seasons.

529
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:05,024
He's making the most money
straight up on paper, but...

530
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:07,485
- Grady Seasons?
- But that doesn't mean anything.

531
00:33:07,569 --> 00:33:10,237
- Grady Seasons.
- The real money is in the practice room.

532
00:33:10,572 --> 00:33:12,657
That's where you get a good game.

533
00:33:12,741 --> 00:33:15,910
I mean, a guy can get wiped out
in the first day of the tournament,

534
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,953
and hang around in the practice room
for a couple of days,

535
00:33:18,038 --> 00:33:19,872
and make more money than the guy
who won the tournament.

536
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:21,248
Do you hear that?

537
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:22,750
The practice room!

538
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:24,627
Hey, watch the paint.

539
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,128
What?

540
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:27,421
Oh.

541
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:30,466
- Is that metal on yourjacket?
- Sorry about that.

542
00:33:30,801 --> 00:33:31,801
Shit.

543
00:33:47,317 --> 00:33:49,151
Rubba-dub,
here comes the grub.

544
00:33:51,613 --> 00:33:53,489
My pancakes are burnt.

545
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:57,535
What's this? No, no, wait a minute.
We ordered four on, two up.

546
00:33:57,619 --> 00:33:58,661
I don't want sausage.

547
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:00,454
Sorry, I must've given you
the wrong order.

548
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:03,124
- That's a dead giveaway.
- What is?

549
00:34:03,333 --> 00:34:06,419
- The four on two.
- Oh, egg talk.

550
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:09,880
She was the killer waitress
at the Acropolis.

551
00:34:09,965 --> 00:34:13,676
Then she did them a favor and quit.

552
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,802
Ow!

553
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:17,513
What do you think?
He's the only one who has to work?

554
00:34:20,267 --> 00:34:22,143
How come you don't
play pool anymore?

555
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:23,644
I quit.

556
00:34:25,814 --> 00:34:27,773
Actually, somebody retired me.

557
00:34:27,858 --> 00:34:30,192
Sometimes you get in with
the wrong kind of people, you know?

558
00:34:30,277 --> 00:34:31,819
But, hey, that was a long time ago.

559
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:34,947
Back east. It's dead and buried.
I don't even think about it.

560
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:37,324
I won my share of medals.

561
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:41,704
Don't you ever feel
like picking it up again?

562
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:43,247
I mean,
you're always around those pool halls,

563
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:44,457
you know, you see these guys...

564
00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:48,127
I'm too old. My wheels are shot.
It's a young man's game.

565
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:52,923
Besides, there's drugs now.
Kids are playing on coke, speed.

566
00:34:53,008 --> 00:34:54,175
I don't know.

567
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:56,927
When I was younger, it was booze.

568
00:34:57,137 --> 00:34:58,804
Somehow it was more human.

569
00:34:59,681 --> 00:35:01,474
- Booze, huh?
- Booze, yeah.

570
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:03,184
Wine goes back to the Bible.

571
00:35:03,268 --> 00:35:05,352
The Bible never said anything
about amphetamines.

572
00:35:06,438 --> 00:35:08,189
- You religious, Eddie?
- Me?

573
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:11,233
I get high on the man upstairs.

574
00:35:12,694 --> 00:35:14,779
Isn't there a masters' tournament
you can play in?

575
00:35:14,863 --> 00:35:17,740
I mean, I've seen this on the television,
you know, them old golfers and stuff,

576
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:19,992
like an old-timers' tournament?

577
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:23,412
If you're too old to cut the mustard,
you can still lick the jar, right?

578
00:35:23,497 --> 00:35:25,790
Nobody ever asked me
for a refund, honey.

579
00:35:25,916 --> 00:35:27,291
Not yet.

580
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:36,675
Hey, we're just talking
around things here.

581
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:41,222
It ain't about pool, it ain't about sex,
it ain't about love. It's about money.

582
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:43,474
I mean,
the best is the guy with the most.

583
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:46,393
That's the whole show. The best is the
guy with the most in all walks of life.

584
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:49,396
Are you the best liquor salesman?

585
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:51,607
You betcha.

586
00:36:07,958 --> 00:36:09,834
Ah. What a way to get your feet wet.

587
00:36:09,918 --> 00:36:11,752
This place is an all-time classic.

588
00:36:12,629 --> 00:36:14,296
Hey, hey!

589
00:36:14,548 --> 00:36:16,131
Put that cue stick in the trunk.

590
00:36:16,258 --> 00:36:18,759
- What am I going to play with?
- Play with a house cue.

591
00:36:19,052 --> 00:36:22,555
You go in there with that, nobody will
come near you with a nickel.

592
00:36:33,692 --> 00:36:36,277
I can't believe it, I got goose bumps.

593
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:37,611
I love it.

594
00:36:38,488 --> 00:36:42,116
You just sit and watch for a while.
I got to see this guy.

595
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,971
I can't wait to see what's next.

596
00:37:04,848 --> 00:37:08,851
Good thing I didn't
bring the Balabushka.

597
00:37:09,102 --> 00:37:11,645
60%.!
Are we gonna divvy this up in the car?

598
00:37:11,897 --> 00:37:13,147
Enough!

599
00:37:30,582 --> 00:37:32,583
Had enough, junior?

600
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:37,838
Hold on.

601
00:37:43,637 --> 00:37:46,305
What the hell are you doing, Vincent?
Beat him, eat him, and get out of here.

602
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:48,766
I know, I know.
I can't take this guy's money.

603
00:37:49,643 --> 00:37:51,894
- He's got a hole in his throat.
- So what?

604
00:37:52,562 --> 00:37:54,772
That guy's breaking my heart, man.
Look at him.

605
00:37:55,357 --> 00:37:57,399
He looks like he's on his last legs.

606
00:37:57,817 --> 00:38:00,694
What is it so far? 60 bucks?
It's no big deal.

607
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:02,821
No big deal?

608
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:09,411
You want me to quit?

609
00:38:09,579 --> 00:38:12,456
Yeah, if you're going to
keep on dumping like this.

610
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:15,459
Unless.

611
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:17,294
Show me.

612
00:38:18,046 --> 00:38:20,464
Make it a real performance. Show me
you can dump like a professional,

613
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:21,715
it'll be worth it.

614
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,550
Like a professional.

615
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:32,726
Okay, chief. I'll play you for 30.

616
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:39,692
Go around and get the car.

617
00:38:39,901 --> 00:38:42,236
- Why? What for?
- Just bring it around front.

618
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,946
Head it that way.

619
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:46,740
Okay, but that's the wrong way, Eddie.

620
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:48,575
Just do what I tell you.

621
00:38:49,077 --> 00:38:50,577
Yeah, right.

622
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:57,334
Easy shot!
I miss this, I'm a real chump, huh?

623
00:38:58,211 --> 00:38:59,920
Easy. Straight in.

624
00:39:02,257 --> 00:39:04,258
The tough one's the four now.

625
00:39:04,718 --> 00:39:05,718
I don't know.

626
00:39:07,429 --> 00:39:09,013
Oh, my God.

627
00:39:24,571 --> 00:39:28,115
Don't even bother.
I just can't hit nothing! Jesus!

628
00:39:28,533 --> 00:39:31,702
- That's it, kid. Where's the money?
- Yeah, I know. That's it.

629
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:36,457
Uh, Eddie? Eddie!

630
00:39:37,292 --> 00:39:39,460
Where's the money,
you dirty little prick?

631
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:42,296
Hey, Eddie's got the money.
See where they went?

632
00:39:42,422 --> 00:39:44,131
- Where did they go?
- Hey, it looks like they left.

633
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:46,300
Hey, relax. Take it easy. What are you...

634
00:39:46,676 --> 00:39:48,343
What the fuck's the matter
with you guys?

635
00:39:48,428 --> 00:39:50,012
Get your fucking hands off...

636
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:51,889
Come on. I'm going to get your money!

637
00:39:51,973 --> 00:39:54,141
What the fuck are you doing?
Just hold it. Just relax.

638
00:39:54,601 --> 00:39:56,477
Take it easy, take it easy.

639
00:40:08,782 --> 00:40:10,908
Come on. I'm his father!

640
00:40:10,992 --> 00:40:13,660
- Father?
- You little bastard! What do I do?

641
00:40:13,745 --> 00:40:15,496
I tell you not to play, I tell you to play!

642
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:18,457
Ease off! Family! Get out of here.

643
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:20,334
Yo-yo.

644
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:26,924
You little punk! I hope
your mother kicks the shit out of you.

645
00:40:30,512 --> 00:40:32,012
Okay, go, go, go!

646
00:40:37,727 --> 00:40:39,353
Where to? Where?

647
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:40,604
Take the parkway south
down to Norwich.

648
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:42,606
- All right, all right.
- You never...

649
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:44,441
Damn it, you never
ease off on somebody like that.

650
00:40:44,526 --> 00:40:46,151
Not when there's money involved.

651
00:40:48,321 --> 00:40:51,990
That's the problem with mercy, kid.
It just ain't professional.

652
00:40:53,076 --> 00:40:54,701
Let me look at your face.

653
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:58,080
You'll live.

654
00:40:58,623 --> 00:40:59,623
You're gonna live, right?

655
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:04,002
Get out of my face, will you?
Jesus Christ.

656
00:41:09,134 --> 00:41:10,300
My father.

657
00:41:11,052 --> 00:41:12,094
Saved your ass.

658
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:15,639
Carmen, what's to be learned from this?

659
00:41:16,516 --> 00:41:17,975
Nice guys finish last.

660
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:20,561
Is that original
or did you just make that up?

661
00:41:21,062 --> 00:41:23,522
Vincent, you look so sexy
with that bloody lip.

662
00:41:24,566 --> 00:41:25,691
Shut up.

663
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:29,903
You guys want me to drive?

664
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:32,072
No, I'm good.

665
00:41:33,992 --> 00:41:36,702
- Slimy son of a bitch.
- What?

666
00:41:36,786 --> 00:41:38,370
That guy, the hole.

667
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:41,456
I'll stick a pool cue down his throat.

668
00:41:41,541 --> 00:41:44,418
Go back there with a fucking cannon
and blow all their asses away!

669
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:46,170
Oh, Vincent, that's gross.

670
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,506
- Next time, kid.
- I'm sorry.

671
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:01,185
One of you guys know
where the Triumph Motel is?

672
00:42:01,269 --> 00:42:03,020
The what? The what?

673
00:42:03,104 --> 00:42:05,981
- Triumph Motel.
- Yeah, yeah.

674
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:09,443
Go left on Aurora and right on Seneca.

675
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:11,361
Chalkie's still around?

676
00:42:11,446 --> 00:42:13,447
- Chalkie's?
- Yeah, it's a pool hall.

677
00:42:13,823 --> 00:42:16,366
I know what it is, man.
Yeah, it's still around.

678
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:18,535
What?
It's supposed to move somewhere?

679
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:21,288
Some things never change.

680
00:42:21,581 --> 00:42:23,123
Man, I wouldn't bet on it.

681
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:29,213
- Eddie.
- Enter!

682
00:42:31,299 --> 00:42:32,633
Hey, good morning.

683
00:42:34,427 --> 00:42:35,427
What's happening?

684
00:42:35,762 --> 00:42:37,137
Come on. Let's get going, guys.

685
00:42:37,305 --> 00:42:38,972
I'm ordering room service.
You want anything?

686
00:42:41,851 --> 00:42:43,185
Food, you hungry?

687
00:42:43,853 --> 00:42:45,145
I hate the weather!

688
00:42:47,774 --> 00:42:49,441
You can't get room service in a motel.

689
00:42:50,068 --> 00:42:51,693
Come on, let's check out Chalkie's.

690
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:53,528
Tell your girlfriend to get going.

691
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:55,781
Meet you all downstairs in the lobby.

692
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:58,617
What about food? I'm starved!

693
00:43:01,162 --> 00:43:03,163
- Vincent?
- Yeah?

694
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:05,874
Don't change the shirt, it's a nice touch.

695
00:43:06,334 --> 00:43:08,543
- Shirt?
- And leave the cue stick.

696
00:43:08,878 --> 00:43:10,879
What the hell's the use of having it?

697
00:43:12,882 --> 00:43:15,092
This used to be a nice
average bad neighborhood.

698
00:43:15,176 --> 00:43:17,135
- Now look at it.
- Yeah, look at this.

699
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:19,054
Is all the places going to be like this?

700
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:21,932
I mean, on your pool hall scale
of one to 10, what do you rate this?

701
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:24,476
-10.
- At least this one's got tables.

702
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,104
- Hi, guys.
- How you doing?

703
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:32,234
Squeeze me in?

704
00:43:33,152 --> 00:43:35,529
Table Number 7 for Fast Eddie.

705
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:40,534
Yeah, see you don't recognize
Orvis from way back when.

706
00:43:41,536 --> 00:43:44,246
Son of a bitch.
What the hell are you doing here?

707
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:48,250
Now you starting to remember.
How long do you want it for?

708
00:43:48,418 --> 00:43:49,459
A couple hours.

709
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:53,130
The last time I saw you,
you were sweeping up at McGirr's.

710
00:43:53,214 --> 00:43:55,340
Sweeping up at McGirr's, that's right.

711
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:57,843
Then I started working here for Chalkie.

712
00:43:58,219 --> 00:44:01,722
Till he got scared of the bad element
moving in and sold out.

713
00:44:02,307 --> 00:44:04,099
Since then I've been running Chalkie's.

714
00:44:04,934 --> 00:44:07,269
Well, what can I do for you?
Looking for some action?

715
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:10,647
Usually I steer for 20%,
but for you it's 10.

716
00:44:10,732 --> 00:44:13,066
Not me.
It's my friend here wants a game.

717
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:14,735
How you doing, Orvis?

718
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:22,034
Wild place you got here.

719
00:44:25,538 --> 00:44:27,581
What are you doing, Eddie?
Stakehorsing?

720
00:44:29,042 --> 00:44:31,418
You know who you got here
stakehorsing for you?

721
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:34,463
This here is Fast Eddie Felson.

722
00:44:34,547 --> 00:44:36,381
Who the hell are you?
The end of the world?

723
00:44:36,466 --> 00:44:38,800
Come on, ease it up, will you, Orvis?

724
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:44,264
Him, I'll steer for 15, since he's staked
by Fast Eddie the Stakehorse.

725
00:44:45,308 --> 00:44:47,434
What you playing, nine-ball or straight?

726
00:45:03,326 --> 00:45:06,787
It's in the way that you use it

727
00:45:06,871 --> 00:45:08,663
- You should go back to the motel.
- Why?

728
00:45:08,748 --> 00:45:11,291
Why? What? Are you kidding me?
Take a look around this place.

729
00:45:11,376 --> 00:45:13,126
There's gotta be tons
of rape artists here. "Why?"

730
00:45:13,252 --> 00:45:14,878
Maybe you should go back to the motel.

731
00:45:15,046 --> 00:45:16,296
- Me?
- A pretty boy like you.

732
00:45:16,381 --> 00:45:17,798
- Cut it out.
- A cute boy like you.

733
00:45:17,882 --> 00:45:19,299
- I'm serious...
- You're such a cute boy.

734
00:45:19,384 --> 00:45:20,592
- Carmen.
- Vincent.

735
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:23,220
- Not here.
- Hey. Let me give you the scoop, killer.

736
00:45:23,304 --> 00:45:25,847
See that guy with the tiepin
in his nose over there?

737
00:45:28,309 --> 00:45:29,267
Yeah.

738
00:45:29,352 --> 00:45:31,561
Okay, that's Moselle.
Him, we stay away from.

739
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:34,564
- No shit.
- Grow up.

740
00:45:34,649 --> 00:45:37,567
Him, we stay away from,
'cause he's the main stick around here.

741
00:45:37,652 --> 00:45:40,821
You beat him, it scares away
that gentleman over there.

742
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:42,614
Who's he?

743
00:45:42,907 --> 00:45:46,284
That's Earl. He comes in here,
he's got $5,000, $6,000 in his pocket.

744
00:45:46,494 --> 00:45:47,786
- Jesus.
- Yeah.

745
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:50,872
Runs the numbers,
Orvis says he don't mind losing,

746
00:45:50,957 --> 00:45:52,332
he just don't like to give it away.

747
00:45:52,542 --> 00:45:54,418
So you beat Moselle

748
00:45:55,211 --> 00:45:57,671
and old Earl over there loses interest.

749
00:45:58,673 --> 00:46:00,090
What happens now?

750
00:46:00,675 --> 00:46:03,343
Nothing for a little while.
We'll play over here.

751
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:08,056
He'll be watching you
and he'll come to you.

752
00:46:08,891 --> 00:46:10,976
- Who am I going to play?
- Me.

753
00:46:11,561 --> 00:46:13,270
You? Okay.

754
00:46:13,563 --> 00:46:16,231
Eddie, but before we go,
I want her to go back to the motel.

755
00:46:16,315 --> 00:46:17,274
Oh, Christ.

756
00:46:17,358 --> 00:46:19,109
I'm sorry, but this place
is goddamn birdland.

757
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:21,486
Look, I've been in worse places,
I've dated worse guys.

758
00:46:21,571 --> 00:46:23,822
- Hey, Carmen.
- Hey, hey, watch your hands.

759
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,533
Okay, okay, okay. That's enough.

760
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:28,118
- That's enough.
- You gotta tell me.

761
00:46:28,202 --> 00:46:30,036
- Let go, Vincent.
- Okay, that's enough.

762
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:32,914
Tell Orvis to get you a cab
back to the motel.

763
00:46:32,999 --> 00:46:34,124
- I don't want to take a cab.
- Carmen, Carmen.

764
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:35,709
Goddamn it!

765
00:46:38,337 --> 00:46:39,796
Jesus Christ.

766
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:48,555
No thunderbolt breaks, no runs over
four balls. Just take it nice and easy.

767
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:51,892
Fate stumbles in

768
00:46:52,393 --> 00:46:54,936
She never went out
with any guys like these.

769
00:46:55,104 --> 00:46:59,399
Vincent, would you pay attention?
That guy Earl is paying attention.

770
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:01,735
Are you listening to me?

771
00:47:02,403 --> 00:47:03,820
Yeah, yeah.

772
00:47:05,406 --> 00:47:09,034
I needed someone

773
00:47:09,535 --> 00:47:11,786
Do you want me to break?
You want to break?

774
00:47:12,246 --> 00:47:13,747
No. I'll break.

775
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:20,045
What'd they do,
saw the legs off this thing?

776
00:47:20,129 --> 00:47:22,130
This is a table for dwarfs or something.

777
00:47:22,256 --> 00:47:27,219
Come on, Fast Eddie. I want to see
some heavy legend action here.

778
00:47:27,595 --> 00:47:29,846
I think I see 35 balls down there.

779
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:35,227
Out of left field

780
00:47:36,604 --> 00:47:37,896
Not bad, huh?

781
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:39,189
Love came along

782
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:40,899
This isn't pool. This is for bangers.

783
00:47:40,983 --> 00:47:44,945
Straight pool is pool. This is like
handball or cribbage or something.

784
00:47:47,448 --> 00:47:51,535
Straight pool, you got to
be a real surgeon to get over.

785
00:47:52,495 --> 00:47:54,037
It's all finesse.

786
00:47:55,498 --> 00:47:58,333
Now everything is nine-ball,
'cause it's fast.

787
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:02,462
Good for TV.
Good for a loud break shot.

788
00:48:03,631 --> 00:48:06,466
Oh, well, what the hell?
Checkers sells more than chess.

789
00:48:09,804 --> 00:48:10,929
Pretty damn good.

790
00:48:11,013 --> 00:48:13,557
Not bad for a blind man. Rack them up.

791
00:48:13,641 --> 00:48:15,433
Yes, sir, boss.

792
00:48:16,686 --> 00:48:18,395
Rack them up for Mr. Fast Eddie.

793
00:48:18,479 --> 00:48:20,814
I haven't played serious pool
since before you were born.

794
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:24,067
Right off the bat,
I'm laying them to waste.

795
00:48:24,652 --> 00:48:26,987
Watch this. Nine on the break.

796
00:48:29,115 --> 00:48:30,115
Oh!

797
00:48:30,199 --> 00:48:31,575
Jesus, Eddie!

798
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,327
Damn.

799
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:37,664
- All yours.
- That was phenomenal!

800
00:48:39,458 --> 00:48:42,502
I'd like to play that big dude Moselle.
I bet he ain't that good.

801
00:48:44,005 --> 00:48:45,171
Yeah?

802
00:48:47,049 --> 00:48:48,425
I don't know, Eddie.

803
00:48:48,968 --> 00:48:50,343
Maybe you're right.

804
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:53,763
Maybe this game is just for bangers.

805
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:07,152
Cool it.

806
00:49:07,236 --> 00:49:09,195
But the thing is,

807
00:49:11,574 --> 00:49:14,659
even if it is just for bangers,
everybody's doing it.

808
00:49:17,246 --> 00:49:18,580
If everybody's doing it,

809
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:22,709
that's a lot of guys doing it.

810
00:49:27,173 --> 00:49:28,757
A lot of guys doing it,

811
00:49:38,184 --> 00:49:40,560
but only one guy can be the best.

812
00:49:48,027 --> 00:49:49,361
Eddie, hey.

813
00:49:51,072 --> 00:49:52,072
Hey!

814
00:49:53,741 --> 00:49:54,741
Eddie.

815
00:49:57,328 --> 00:49:58,328
Eddie!

816
00:49:58,579 --> 00:50:00,038
Eddie, what?

817
00:50:00,164 --> 00:50:04,834
Where you going? All right, hey,
those were easy shots, man.

818
00:50:05,378 --> 00:50:07,504
Come on, all right, okay.

819
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:10,840
I'm sorry. I'm a smartass,
I was showing off. I'm sorry, all right?

820
00:50:10,925 --> 00:50:12,592
- You know what this is turning into?
- What?

821
00:50:12,677 --> 00:50:15,053
A waste of my time
and a waste of my money.

822
00:50:19,809 --> 00:50:22,435
Where are you going, huh?
Eddie! What?

823
00:50:22,603 --> 00:50:24,938
You're gonna leave me here? What?

824
00:50:26,732 --> 00:50:28,775
I don't believe this guy!

825
00:50:42,331 --> 00:50:43,623
Child care.

826
00:50:45,626 --> 00:50:46,626
Eddie.

827
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:00,557
Vincent back?

828
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:02,976
- Yeah, but he's out.
- What do you mean, out?

829
00:51:03,686 --> 00:51:05,061
Out, like not in the room.

830
00:51:05,479 --> 00:51:07,981
- Mind getting dressed?
- Why, are we going somewhere?

831
00:51:10,443 --> 00:51:12,360
Guy comes into the room.
What if I was somebody else?

832
00:51:12,445 --> 00:51:13,445
Like who?

833
00:51:13,654 --> 00:51:16,489
- That's not the point.
- Look, I'm not naked or anything.

834
00:51:17,450 --> 00:51:19,868
And another thing,
work with me, not against me.

835
00:51:19,952 --> 00:51:21,953
Don't go saying to Vincent
what you said to him at Chalkie's.

836
00:51:22,121 --> 00:51:23,329
Gets him all upset.

837
00:51:24,331 --> 00:51:26,207
If you're going to use that thing,
use it right.

838
00:51:27,835 --> 00:51:29,294
Use what thing?

839
00:51:35,384 --> 00:51:36,801
- C'mon.
- What are doing?

840
00:51:36,886 --> 00:51:38,511
- Me and you!
- Let me go.

841
00:51:38,596 --> 00:51:40,597
- I like it in the shower.
- No!

842
00:51:40,681 --> 00:51:42,599
A quick one before Vincent
gets back, all right?

843
00:51:42,683 --> 00:51:43,683
Hey.

844
00:51:45,311 --> 00:51:46,770
I'm not your daddy,
I'm not your boyfriend,

845
00:51:46,854 --> 00:51:49,189
so don't be playing games with me.
I'm your partner.

846
00:51:49,398 --> 00:51:51,566
You don't flirt with me,
you don't come on with me.

847
00:51:51,859 --> 00:51:53,485
If you take a shower,
you shut the goddamn door!

848
00:51:53,569 --> 00:51:54,986
Don't flatter yourself.

849
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:57,822
Don't waste my time
with bullshit, Carmen.

850
00:52:10,211 --> 00:52:13,087
We got a racehorse here.
A thoroughbred.

851
00:52:13,422 --> 00:52:15,715
You make him feel good.
I teach him how to run.

852
00:52:16,509 --> 00:52:18,885
Do you understand me?
We're business people.

853
00:52:22,473 --> 00:52:23,807
Gotcha.

854
00:52:30,314 --> 00:52:31,773
Where's the Balabushka?

855
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:35,276
- Vincent took it.
- I thought you said he was out.

856
00:52:35,861 --> 00:52:37,320
Yeah, he was in, he was out.

857
00:52:38,030 --> 00:52:39,739
- He took the cue stick?
- Yes.

858
00:52:40,574 --> 00:52:42,951
- And you let him?
- So what?

859
00:52:46,497 --> 00:52:47,747
Shit.

860
00:52:50,584 --> 00:52:53,878
- I'm sorry.
- Jesus goddamn!

861
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:55,755
Child care.

862
00:53:15,526 --> 00:53:16,609
Shit.

863
00:53:20,823 --> 00:53:22,156
Good game. Good game.

864
00:53:26,287 --> 00:53:27,745
What you got in there?

865
00:53:28,998 --> 00:53:30,290
In here?

866
00:53:37,298 --> 00:53:38,423
Doom.

867
00:53:43,137 --> 00:53:46,222
- Come on, boy, let's play.
- Yeah, let's play.

868
00:53:46,891 --> 00:53:48,141
We're gonna have a lot of fun.

869
00:53:51,145 --> 00:53:53,271
Werewolves of London

870
00:54:16,545 --> 00:54:20,590
He's the hairy-handed gent
Who ran amuck in Kent

871
00:54:21,175 --> 00:54:24,385
Lately he's been overheard in Mayfair

872
00:54:26,055 --> 00:54:30,183
You better stay away from him
He'll rip your lungs out, Jim

873
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:33,478
I'd like to meet his tailor

874
00:54:36,982 --> 00:54:39,192
Werewolves of London

875
00:54:46,617 --> 00:54:48,368
Werewolves of London

876
00:54:54,667 --> 00:54:57,627
Well, I saw Lon Chaney
Walking with the Queen

877
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:06,427
I saw Lon Chaney Jr.
Walking with the Queen

878
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:10,848
Doing the Werewolves of London

879
00:55:12,476 --> 00:55:15,645
I saw a werewolf drinking
A pina colada at Trader Vic's

880
00:55:17,898 --> 00:55:19,649
His hair was perfect

881
00:55:27,366 --> 00:55:29,575
Werewolves of London

882
00:55:34,415 --> 00:55:35,540
Ow!

883
00:55:54,435 --> 00:55:56,686
Not bad, my man. Not bad.

884
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:59,397
- When you leaving town? Now, right?
- You don't want to play me again?

885
00:55:59,481 --> 00:56:02,442
Moselle, I'm joking.
Don't kill me, all right?

886
00:56:10,826 --> 00:56:12,285
That boy's hot.

887
00:56:19,585 --> 00:56:21,169
Did you see me tonight?

888
00:56:22,254 --> 00:56:23,254
Hey!

889
00:56:23,797 --> 00:56:26,632
What? I made money.

890
00:56:27,134 --> 00:56:30,428
You lost money.
The town is dead for you.

891
00:56:31,013 --> 00:56:34,807
What the hell is it? Do I not speak your
native language? What is the matter?

892
00:56:34,975 --> 00:56:37,727
You give me this stick, okay,
and then you tell me to lay low.

893
00:56:37,811 --> 00:56:40,563
I mean, the goddamn thing, I lay it
down, it just jumps up at me, man.

894
00:56:40,647 --> 00:56:42,607
You don't deserve this stick.

895
00:56:43,942 --> 00:56:45,485
I don't deserve this?

896
00:56:47,446 --> 00:56:49,489
You don't deserve this stick.

897
00:56:49,615 --> 00:56:52,825
All you do is you sit in there and
you talk, you know, you tell me things.

898
00:56:53,327 --> 00:56:55,203
Did you see me there tonight? I played.

899
00:56:55,329 --> 00:56:57,497
I'm a fucking pool player, Eddie.

900
00:57:00,125 --> 00:57:02,460
Know something? I'm a fucking animal!

901
00:57:04,755 --> 00:57:05,755
Animal.

902
00:57:11,011 --> 00:57:13,096
Vincent, get in the car.
This is embarrassing.

903
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:16,182
You're acting like some girl
who got felt up in a drive-in.

904
00:57:18,393 --> 00:57:21,604
- This looks terrible. Get in, will you?
- Tough shit!

905
00:57:22,898 --> 00:57:25,650
How much did you take off of Moselle?
I heard 100.

906
00:57:25,984 --> 00:57:26,984
One fifty.

907
00:57:27,611 --> 00:57:30,279
- Hundred and fifty.
- Yeah, 150.

908
00:57:30,739 --> 00:57:32,532
You walk into a shoe store
with 150 bucks

909
00:57:32,616 --> 00:57:34,492
and you come out with one shoe!

910
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:38,246
We were working on 5,000.

911
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:42,375
Come on. Get in, it's cold.

912
00:57:47,089 --> 00:57:48,464
Vincent.

913
00:57:52,678 --> 00:57:56,472
Well, I gotta hand it to you, kid.
You got me talking to myself.

914
00:57:57,224 --> 00:58:00,143
I got half of me that says I got a hold
of the best thing that I ever seen

915
00:58:00,227 --> 00:58:02,395
and half of me that says
it just ain't worth it.

916
00:58:04,398 --> 00:58:06,274
I mean, either I don't teach you right,

917
00:58:06,859 --> 00:58:10,236
or you don't listen.
Or you listen, but you don't hear.

918
00:58:12,114 --> 00:58:15,783
What was that voodoo stuff back there?
That wasn't pool. That was a circus!

919
00:58:15,909 --> 00:58:17,410
You dropped your pants.

920
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:20,580
You want to get known? Good.
You and Gypsy Rose Lee.

921
00:58:24,126 --> 00:58:25,918
I can always go back to whiskey.

922
00:58:26,086 --> 00:58:27,420
It's been very good to me.

923
00:58:27,671 --> 00:58:32,175
I mean, you're sitting in it
and I'm wearing it.

924
00:58:32,259 --> 00:58:36,220
But it's tired.
You know, it's just kind of run out.

925
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:39,515
All of a sudden you appear on
the scene, and I'm jumping again.

926
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:47,231
You remind me that money won
is twice as sweet as money earned.

927
00:58:48,817 --> 00:58:51,068
Twenty-five years ago,
I had the screws put on me.

928
00:58:51,778 --> 00:58:53,696
I mean, it was over for me

929
00:58:54,281 --> 00:58:56,157
before it really got started.

930
00:58:57,451 --> 00:59:00,870
But I'm hungry again
and you bled that back into me.

931
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:04,123
You gotta have two things to win.

932
00:59:05,125 --> 00:59:08,419
You gotta have brains
and you gotta have balls.

933
00:59:08,879 --> 00:59:11,130
Now, you got too much of one
and not enough of the other.

934
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:18,095
All right.

935
00:59:18,805 --> 00:59:22,975
I don't know. Tell me what you
want to do. Give me a clue.

936
00:59:27,481 --> 00:59:28,481
Uh...

937
00:59:35,697 --> 00:59:40,243
I'll try, I'll really try.
You know, let's go for it.

938
00:59:42,663 --> 00:59:44,705
You know, Eddie, I mean,

939
00:59:45,874 --> 00:59:49,126
it's just tough for me to lay down.
You know, it's just...

940
00:59:49,836 --> 00:59:52,713
I get in there and it's just tough.
It's just...

941
00:59:54,508 --> 00:59:56,425
It's just tough to lay down.

942
00:59:57,427 --> 00:59:59,178
But I'll try, okay?

943
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:01,347
Tough to lay down?

944
01:00:02,057 --> 01:00:05,518
Well, roll over, sweetheart. Give me.

945
01:00:07,521 --> 01:00:09,355
- What?
- Ninety bucks.

946
01:00:09,481 --> 01:00:12,024
60%. of 150 is 90 bucks.

947
01:00:21,410 --> 01:00:22,868
Did I wake you up?

948
01:00:23,912 --> 01:00:25,746
Well, do you want to hang up?

949
01:00:27,874 --> 01:00:29,875
Are you still pissed off at me?

950
01:00:31,378 --> 01:00:35,214
Well, if you were, I'd understand.

951
01:00:39,011 --> 01:00:43,723
I don't know. I'm having nightmares,
sweats and everything.

952
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:45,808
What kind of rent are you paying?

953
01:00:45,892 --> 01:00:48,394
I said, what kind of rent do you pay?

954
01:00:51,523 --> 01:00:52,982
Well, listen.

955
01:00:54,234 --> 01:00:56,027
After the Bahamas,

956
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:59,905
maybe you could move in with me.

957
01:01:00,032 --> 01:01:01,699
Just for practice.

958
01:01:03,827 --> 01:01:07,330
What do you mean? No, nothing's
going on. What are you, a shrink?

959
01:01:07,414 --> 01:01:09,957
I miss you. I say nice things to you.

960
01:01:12,753 --> 01:01:13,836
Fine.

961
01:01:15,088 --> 01:01:17,757
A couple of curve balls
every now and then.

962
01:01:18,091 --> 01:01:21,427
They're young. They're kids.
No, no. You're perfect.

963
01:01:25,265 --> 01:01:29,602
I love this. Hey, Carmen, you should
have seen Eddie play last night.

964
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:31,145
Are we going to
make some money today,

965
01:01:31,229 --> 01:01:33,481
or am I still talking
to Our Lady of the Cue Balls?

966
01:01:33,565 --> 01:01:35,649
We'll make some money. Definitely.

967
01:01:35,776 --> 01:01:37,360
I'm a wild man today.

968
01:01:37,527 --> 01:01:40,488
Did you ever hear of a hustle
called "two brothers and a stranger"?

969
01:01:40,947 --> 01:01:43,741
Uh, yeah. That's the guy in the Bible
with the many-colored coats, right?

970
01:01:45,786 --> 01:01:47,328
Jesus, Vincent.

971
01:01:48,622 --> 01:01:50,873
Hey, I'm joking, you guys.
Come on. I'm just...

972
01:01:50,957 --> 01:01:52,792
Did I get through to you last night, kid?

973
01:01:53,210 --> 01:01:55,628
'Cause if I didn't,
I'll run it by you another way.

974
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:58,255
If you'd have kicked ass
in any other place but Chalkie's,

975
01:01:58,340 --> 01:02:00,383
Atlantic City would be dead for us.

976
01:02:00,634 --> 01:02:02,843
The guys never leave the street.

977
01:02:02,969 --> 01:02:05,346
Otherwise, it would be all around.

978
01:02:06,765 --> 01:02:09,058
Hey, let me tell you something.

979
01:02:09,351 --> 01:02:13,312
Last night, you know, people never
talked to me like that before.

980
01:02:14,189 --> 01:02:16,065
You really talked to me.

981
01:02:16,775 --> 01:02:19,235
And I just want you to know
that I appreciate it.

982
01:02:19,319 --> 01:02:21,070
- And...
- Okay.

983
01:02:21,154 --> 01:02:23,989
I want to thank you,
you know, for everything.

984
01:02:35,836 --> 01:02:38,045
Don't worry, kid. Don't worry.

985
01:02:43,677 --> 01:02:46,595
Two brothers and a stranger. Okay?

986
01:02:47,347 --> 01:02:49,265
You got two guys
that go into a bar, see?

987
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:56,856
Give me two hours, they'll be
building me a trophy wall in there, huh?

988
01:03:00,193 --> 01:03:02,653
Look at that kid.
He gets to have all the fun.

989
01:03:04,823 --> 01:03:06,323
Lock and load.

990
01:03:14,082 --> 01:03:17,168
All right. Who's next here? You guys,
you want to play? No? Anybody.

991
01:03:17,252 --> 01:03:19,545
You want to play?
What about you? You want to play?

992
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:22,423
- Forget it.
- Spot you the break here.

993
01:03:24,176 --> 01:03:26,427
Come on, I'll spot you the break.
How about it?

994
01:03:26,511 --> 01:03:28,554
- I want the seven ball, too.
- Seven.

995
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:30,389
How about the eight?
I'll give you the eight.

996
01:03:31,683 --> 01:03:34,310
Come on. The eight, the break.
What do you want? All right? You up?

997
01:03:34,394 --> 01:03:35,644
Let's go.

998
01:04:02,005 --> 01:04:03,589
Why don't you keep it down, huh?

999
01:04:06,384 --> 01:04:08,260
What did I say? I coughed.

1000
01:04:17,896 --> 01:04:21,357
- Well.
- Stop it, Eddie.

1001
01:04:22,776 --> 01:04:25,319
- Do you mind?
- Excuse me?

1002
01:04:25,529 --> 01:04:28,239
I said, do you mind? I mean,
it's a money game here, guy. Okay?

1003
01:04:42,254 --> 01:04:44,880
- Big money game.
- Yeah, that's right. A big money game.

1004
01:04:44,965 --> 01:04:48,092
So why don't you take your hands
off the girl and let us play, okay, guy?

1005
01:04:48,218 --> 01:04:50,094
What do you care where I put my hand?

1006
01:04:50,178 --> 01:04:51,428
Why don't you
mind your own business?

1007
01:04:51,513 --> 01:04:52,513
Hey, Gramps.

1008
01:04:52,597 --> 01:04:54,765
Put your teeth back in,
get your hands off your daughter there

1009
01:04:54,849 --> 01:04:57,059
and pay attention. You just
might learn something here today.

1010
01:04:57,143 --> 01:04:59,645
I'll change my teeth,
you change your goddamn diapers.

1011
01:04:59,771 --> 01:05:01,647
Hey, we've got a game going here.

1012
01:05:01,940 --> 01:05:04,984
Really? What are you playing for?

1013
01:05:05,610 --> 01:05:08,612
- What's it to you?
- What are you playing for?

1014
01:05:09,906 --> 01:05:12,283
- Fifty.
- You want to win?

1015
01:05:15,537 --> 01:05:17,830
I'll bet 500 bucks on this guy right here.

1016
01:05:18,456 --> 01:05:19,623
Huh?

1017
01:05:19,874 --> 01:05:21,875
I think you're a choker, kiddo.

1018
01:05:22,002 --> 01:05:23,877
Five hundred bucks says
you choke right now.

1019
01:05:23,962 --> 01:05:25,421
Why don't you take a walk, asshole?

1020
01:05:25,505 --> 01:05:27,381
Anybody want to
bet 500 bucks the kid chokes?

1021
01:05:27,465 --> 01:05:28,924
- Eddie, cut it out.
- What are you starting trouble for?

1022
01:05:29,009 --> 01:05:30,259
I'm not starting any trouble.

1023
01:05:30,343 --> 01:05:31,885
- You're starting trouble.
- Come on. Any takers?

1024
01:05:31,970 --> 01:05:33,721
- Eddie, I'm gonna leave.
- Any takers?

1025
01:05:33,805 --> 01:05:35,848
- This guy's a jerk.
- Want to go for 1,000?

1026
01:05:43,857 --> 01:05:46,525
I know. I mean, you'd think
he would have seen it before.

1027
01:05:46,985 --> 01:05:48,611
- How are you?
- Pretty good.

1028
01:05:48,695 --> 01:05:52,031
Oh, my God,
he got suckered into that so good.

1029
01:05:52,115 --> 01:05:54,366
Unbelievable. Unbelievable.

1030
01:05:54,701 --> 01:05:57,369
- Hey.
- What's up? What do you think?

1031
01:05:57,662 --> 01:05:59,663
- Get in the car.
- Hey.

1032
01:05:59,748 --> 01:06:00,789
Get away from me.

1033
01:06:00,874 --> 01:06:02,791
Hey, Vincent!
What the hell is the matter with you?

1034
01:06:02,876 --> 01:06:04,001
Did you have a good time, huh, Eddie?

1035
01:06:04,085 --> 01:06:06,211
I'm a little disappointed in you, frankly.

1036
01:06:06,379 --> 01:06:09,590
Frankly, huh? Well, frankly, your ass!
I seen you, man.

1037
01:06:09,674 --> 01:06:11,008
- Seen what?
- Don't give me that. I seen you!

1038
01:06:11,092 --> 01:06:12,301
Seen what?

1039
01:06:13,845 --> 01:06:16,138
Screw this. You know what I mean?
I don't need this. I'm gone.

1040
01:06:16,222 --> 01:06:18,891
I'm going home. Come on, Carmen.
We're going home.

1041
01:06:18,975 --> 01:06:20,517
- The hell you are.
- The hell I am?

1042
01:06:20,602 --> 01:06:21,602
You're going home alone, man.

1043
01:06:22,062 --> 01:06:23,854
Is that right?
Now I'm going home alone.

1044
01:06:23,938 --> 01:06:25,272
Yeah, what? Is it you and Eddie now?

1045
01:06:25,357 --> 01:06:27,483
Are you gonna go to bars
and get felt up by Eddie? Is that it?

1046
01:06:27,567 --> 01:06:29,193
- Vincent, Vincent.
- Come on!

1047
01:06:29,361 --> 01:06:31,820
You go in that place, you play your part.
It's nice, huh?

1048
01:06:31,946 --> 01:06:34,198
I put my hands on her,
I'm playing a part. It's acting.

1049
01:06:34,282 --> 01:06:37,743
- Your hands were all over her, Eddie!
- I'm acting! It's acting!

1050
01:06:41,247 --> 01:06:43,499
Hey, look, Vincent,
when you go into movies

1051
01:06:43,625 --> 01:06:47,503
and you see people kissing, what do
you think, they go home together?

1052
01:06:47,587 --> 01:06:51,256
- They're professionals, Vincent.
- We're just trying to be professionals.

1053
01:07:02,268 --> 01:07:05,479
Okay, you guys.
It was just a little rough. Okay?

1054
01:07:05,563 --> 01:07:07,564
I mean, you know,
I ain't used to that, Carmen.

1055
01:07:08,441 --> 01:07:09,400
Vincent. Vincent.

1056
01:07:09,484 --> 01:07:11,026
- I don't know about this.
- Vincent, Vincent, Vincent.

1057
01:07:11,111 --> 01:07:13,237
Vincent the Kid, huh?

1058
01:07:13,488 --> 01:07:15,823
You are gonna be
one of the greats, kiddo.

1059
01:07:16,116 --> 01:07:18,534
One of the greats.
I got a good feeling about this.

1060
01:07:18,618 --> 01:07:19,618
Yeah?

1061
01:07:26,626 --> 01:07:29,420
You say it's black
But you know it's white

1062
01:07:30,213 --> 01:07:33,132
You say it's day
When you know it's night

1063
01:07:33,508 --> 01:07:36,218
You'll say it's good
When you know it's mean

1064
01:07:37,011 --> 01:07:39,847
It's the finest music
That I ever seen

1065
01:07:40,473 --> 01:07:45,602
Don't you tell me nothin'

1066
01:07:47,021 --> 01:07:50,733
So don't you tell me nothin'
I can see

1067
01:07:50,817 --> 01:07:54,111
Rock and rollin'
is good for me

1068
01:08:08,501 --> 01:08:11,587
You say it's a dog
When you know it's two cats

1069
01:08:12,005 --> 01:08:14,840
You say it's a mouse
When you know it's a rat

1070
01:08:15,383 --> 01:08:18,343
You say it's meat
When you know it's bread

1071
01:08:18,511 --> 01:08:21,722
You tell me it's gold
And it's a hunk of lead

1072
01:08:22,182 --> 01:08:24,016
Don't you tell me nothin'

1073
01:08:25,477 --> 01:08:27,770
Well, don't you tell me nothin'

1074
01:08:28,938 --> 01:08:32,316
Don't ya tell me nothin'
I can see

1075
01:08:32,525 --> 01:08:35,861
Rock and rollin'
is good for me

1076
01:08:40,033 --> 01:08:41,992
Don't you tell me nothin'

1077
01:08:57,592 --> 01:09:00,636
You say it's right
And you know it's wrong

1078
01:09:00,804 --> 01:09:03,931
You say it's short
And you know it's long

1079
01:09:04,349 --> 01:09:07,351
You say it's low
When you know it's high

1080
01:09:07,644 --> 01:09:10,854
Tell me the truth
And don't tell no lie

1081
01:09:11,356 --> 01:09:13,565
Don't tell me nothin'

1082
01:09:14,317 --> 01:09:16,235
Don't you tell me nothin'

1083
01:09:17,779 --> 01:09:21,156
Don't tell me nothin'
I can see

1084
01:09:21,616 --> 01:09:23,909
Rock and rollin'
is good for me

1085
01:09:23,993 --> 01:09:27,079
This is too much. No, really. I can't.

1086
01:09:27,163 --> 01:09:29,623
Are you sure you don't
want to play again? I mean...

1087
01:09:42,262 --> 01:09:43,262
Hmm.

1088
01:09:44,097 --> 01:09:45,430
Do you smell what I smell?

1089
01:09:46,015 --> 01:09:47,432
Smoke?

1090
01:09:47,684 --> 01:09:49,226
Money.

1091
01:09:50,562 --> 01:09:52,855
Let's take a stroll around.
See what's what.

1092
01:09:56,067 --> 01:10:01,947
A starless black sky will be
somewhere in America

1093
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:25,470
Hey.

1094
01:10:27,098 --> 01:10:29,433
Check out that guy
that's playing back there.

1095
01:10:30,476 --> 01:10:32,185
- That guy?
- Yeah.

1096
01:10:32,645 --> 01:10:35,814
This is a golden opportunity.
You know who that is?

1097
01:10:35,982 --> 01:10:39,026
That's Grady Seasons.
He's the best money player in the world.

1098
01:10:39,235 --> 01:10:40,569
That's Grady Seasons?

1099
01:10:42,322 --> 01:10:44,323
You want me to play him?

1100
01:10:44,449 --> 01:10:45,657
You bet.

1101
01:10:46,784 --> 01:10:50,120
And you are gonna dump.
You are gonna lose something fierce.

1102
01:10:50,204 --> 01:10:53,248
You're gonna ask for a spot and you're
gonna ask for the break. Everything.

1103
01:10:53,333 --> 01:10:55,250
It's gonna be humiliating.
This is beautiful.

1104
01:10:55,335 --> 01:10:57,836
- What do you mean, dump?
- What do I mean, dump?

1105
01:10:57,962 --> 01:11:00,088
Because if you lose bad now to this guy,

1106
01:11:00,465 --> 01:11:02,549
you'll be a super nobody
in Atlantic City,

1107
01:11:02,634 --> 01:11:04,259
and the odds on you
will drop to nothing.

1108
01:11:04,344 --> 01:11:07,054
- Right?
- See? She learns.

1109
01:11:07,388 --> 01:11:08,430
Let me ask you something.

1110
01:11:08,514 --> 01:11:10,223
I mean, I seen these guys,
they hustle and they win.

1111
01:11:10,308 --> 01:11:11,767
How come I always got to play the jerk?

1112
01:11:11,851 --> 01:11:14,353
I mean, why can't
we have a hustle where I win?

1113
01:11:14,479 --> 01:11:17,898
Because this is better than that.
There's something at the end of this.

1114
01:11:17,982 --> 01:11:22,110
I wouldn't even tell you to do it
unless the payoff was phenomenal.

1115
01:11:25,615 --> 01:11:28,867
Look, do whatever you want to do.
Do it your way. Whatever you want.

1116
01:11:30,203 --> 01:11:32,245
I'm gonna play.
I ask this guy a question,

1117
01:11:32,330 --> 01:11:33,830
he gets his panties in a bunch.

1118
01:11:56,521 --> 01:11:58,397
It's like a nightmare, isn't it?

1119
01:12:05,238 --> 01:12:08,365
It just keeps getting worse and worse,
doesn't it?

1120
01:12:15,456 --> 01:12:17,249
Are you gonna fall for this?

1121
01:12:19,585 --> 01:12:22,629
We're gonna pay hell for it

1122
01:12:25,091 --> 01:12:26,508
Now we can't wait for it

1123
01:12:26,592 --> 01:12:27,634
Oh-ho-ho.

1124
01:12:27,719 --> 01:12:29,219
The impossible dream.

1125
01:12:29,512 --> 01:12:32,180
We let ourselves in for it

1126
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:37,060
Wild calculations

1127
01:12:39,731 --> 01:12:41,898
Exert a fascination

1128
01:12:44,610 --> 01:12:46,945
Tame speculation

1129
01:12:49,157 --> 01:12:52,659
We let ourselves in for it

1130
01:12:56,289 --> 01:12:58,373
Don't choke now.
It's not that hard a shot.

1131
01:13:02,378 --> 01:13:05,297
- Did you just say, "Don't choke now"?
- Yeah. You heard me.

1132
01:13:05,923 --> 01:13:08,467
Yeah. Yeah, I heard you.

1133
01:13:09,135 --> 01:13:11,762
We let ourselves in for it

1134
01:13:15,308 --> 01:13:17,976
We were bound
to make the most of it

1135
01:13:18,227 --> 01:13:20,437
Here's the best of it

1136
01:13:20,521 --> 01:13:22,981
Let yourself in

1137
01:13:24,984 --> 01:13:27,486
Any way that
you figure it

1138
01:13:27,820 --> 01:13:30,280
Got it at our fingertips

1139
01:13:30,490 --> 01:13:32,282
Got to give in

1140
01:13:44,003 --> 01:13:47,339
Hey, Grady. Up your ass with the spot.
Okay with you?

1141
01:13:47,423 --> 01:13:48,840
That's fine with me.

1142
01:15:13,759 --> 01:15:15,218
How you doing?

1143
01:15:16,053 --> 01:15:17,971
Carmen, I'm playing here.

1144
01:15:18,055 --> 01:15:20,473
Yeah, I know. I know. Listen.

1145
01:15:21,225 --> 01:15:24,895
You win one more game, you're gonna
be humping your fist for a long time.

1146
01:15:25,438 --> 01:15:26,605
Okay, Vincent?

1147
01:15:27,607 --> 01:15:28,773
Got that?

1148
01:15:42,747 --> 01:15:44,456
What are you doing, meditating?

1149
01:16:13,611 --> 01:16:14,736
Yeah?

1150
01:16:22,078 --> 01:16:23,912
Yeah? Hey.

1151
01:16:26,999 --> 01:16:28,959
- Can I have the Balabushka?
- Yeah.

1152
01:16:31,504 --> 01:16:33,964
- Are you gonna play, Eddie?
- Yeah, maybe.

1153
01:16:34,173 --> 01:16:35,674
Where?

1154
01:16:35,758 --> 01:16:37,968
- I don't know. Gunther's.
- Gunther's?

1155
01:16:38,261 --> 01:16:39,261
Want me to go with you?

1156
01:16:39,345 --> 01:16:40,971
- No, that's okay.
- You're not mad at me, are you?

1157
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:43,640
- About last night?
- No, you done good.

1158
01:16:45,685 --> 01:16:49,354
- Where's he going?
- He's going to Gunther's, ja.

1159
01:17:19,885 --> 01:17:20,927
Hey, Bill.

1160
01:17:22,596 --> 01:17:24,180
Why don't you call Dud?

1161
01:17:36,193 --> 01:17:37,235
Thank you.

1162
01:17:38,404 --> 01:17:40,739
Bill, I'll have another Drambuie
and potato salad.

1163
01:17:40,906 --> 01:17:43,867
And while you're at it, give my friend
Eddie here another J.T.S. Brown.

1164
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:46,578
- One more time?
- Absolutely.

1165
01:17:47,538 --> 01:17:52,000
You know, you remind me a lot
of a guy I played about 20 years ago.

1166
01:17:52,335 --> 01:17:56,421
Matter of fact, it was right after that,
that five of us went on a road trip

1167
01:17:56,505 --> 01:17:57,672
to San Antonio.

1168
01:17:58,174 --> 01:18:00,508
We didn't get any action.
The windup was

1169
01:18:00,593 --> 01:18:03,428
all five of us ended up
playing each other.

1170
01:18:04,638 --> 01:18:06,473
That's all she wrote.

1171
01:18:07,058 --> 01:18:09,225
- Nice book, though.
- Buy you one?

1172
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:12,687
No, I'll buy you one.
I'm gonna play for a while.

1173
01:18:13,314 --> 01:18:15,357
It's crazy, man. I mean,

1174
01:18:15,441 --> 01:18:19,194
I was working at this job, busting
my butt for about a year and a half.

1175
01:18:19,278 --> 01:18:21,154
They didn't give me a raise.

1176
01:18:21,238 --> 01:18:23,698
So my old lady, she leaves me,
'cause she says I'm a bum,

1177
01:18:23,783 --> 01:18:24,908
'cause I quit.

1178
01:18:26,452 --> 01:18:32,374
Then after, I get this job working at the
university strictly for the experience.

1179
01:18:33,459 --> 01:18:35,460
- Guess what it was.
- What?

1180
01:18:36,087 --> 01:18:38,046
- What?
- Well, what were you?

1181
01:18:38,130 --> 01:18:40,590
- I was a subject.
- A what?

1182
01:18:40,674 --> 01:18:43,301
A subject in the psych department.

1183
01:18:43,719 --> 01:18:45,762
I was a subject for experiments.

1184
01:18:47,348 --> 01:18:50,475
Reflexes, memory things.

1185
01:18:50,768 --> 01:18:53,937
Except I didn't do anything
where I got that electric shock.

1186
01:18:54,105 --> 01:18:58,316
Well, I did this once, but I just did that
for the experience, so it don't count.

1187
01:19:00,778 --> 01:19:02,404
- Shit.
- Thank you.

1188
01:19:10,162 --> 01:19:12,539
Okay. That's 80.

1189
01:19:14,291 --> 01:19:16,292
- Do it again?
- Yeah, sure, I don't care.

1190
01:19:16,377 --> 01:19:17,919
- Double or nothing?
- Double or nothing?

1191
01:19:18,838 --> 01:19:20,255
What is there, an echo in here?

1192
01:19:21,841 --> 01:19:24,050
Let's just do it, all right? Let's play.

1193
01:19:28,305 --> 01:19:30,098
Eddie, how you doing?

1194
01:19:30,808 --> 01:19:33,852
- Holding my own and a little bit of his.
- Good man.

1195
01:19:35,521 --> 01:19:36,688
Here!

1196
01:19:38,065 --> 01:19:39,607
Go! Go!

1197
01:19:40,401 --> 01:19:43,736
Go! Go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go!

1198
01:19:43,821 --> 01:19:44,904
Fall!

1199
01:19:47,032 --> 01:19:48,158
Is that it?

1200
01:19:50,494 --> 01:19:51,786
Do it again.

1201
01:19:52,329 --> 01:19:53,538
Double or nothing?

1202
01:19:54,039 --> 01:19:55,123
What else?

1203
01:19:55,791 --> 01:19:56,958
All right.

1204
01:20:04,717 --> 01:20:07,927
That is bullshit. I never did that!

1205
01:20:09,388 --> 01:20:11,222
That is luck, man!

1206
01:20:13,017 --> 01:20:14,559
I'm really sorry.

1207
01:20:14,643 --> 01:20:17,437
There's nothing I can do.
The nine ball fell.

1208
01:20:18,647 --> 01:20:20,356
I can't believe that.

1209
01:20:21,609 --> 01:20:22,984
You a hustler, Amos?

1210
01:20:25,112 --> 01:20:27,405
Come on, Eddie, man. Luck.

1211
01:20:29,575 --> 01:20:30,742
Are you a hustler?

1212
01:20:33,537 --> 01:20:35,788
Hey, you don't want to pay me?

1213
01:20:36,499 --> 01:20:38,249
Keep it. Forget it.

1214
01:20:38,876 --> 01:20:40,668
I don't want no bad feelings.

1215
01:20:41,337 --> 01:20:42,754
I mean, a guy loses.

1216
01:20:43,881 --> 01:20:45,757
I lost, I paid. I don't...

1217
01:20:48,010 --> 01:20:49,969
You a hustler, Amos?

1218
01:20:55,768 --> 01:20:57,936
What? You want to quit?

1219
01:21:01,148 --> 01:21:02,649
Fuck you, kid.

1220
01:21:03,984 --> 01:21:05,276
Double it again.

1221
01:21:46,902 --> 01:21:50,530
Hey, I want to ask you something.
I want you to be real honest with me.

1222
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:56,953
You think I need to lose some weight?

1223
01:22:26,567 --> 01:22:30,903
How could I get suckered like that?

1224
01:22:36,201 --> 01:22:38,286
You've got to work hard.
I mean, that takes a real gift

1225
01:22:38,370 --> 01:22:41,497
to show your ass like that.

1226
01:22:45,544 --> 01:22:48,546
Everything, I got a stack.

1227
01:22:49,923 --> 01:22:52,342
Everything just right,
a little too much booze.

1228
01:22:53,218 --> 01:22:54,844
A little too cocky.

1229
01:22:55,554 --> 01:22:57,388
Right amount ofjerk.

1230
01:23:00,893 --> 01:23:03,519
You missed all those fucking signals!

1231
01:23:17,618 --> 01:23:19,619
You'll get him next time.

1232
01:23:36,595 --> 01:23:38,596
How much would you need
to go it on your own?

1233
01:23:39,098 --> 01:23:40,723
From here to Atlantic City?

1234
01:23:41,725 --> 01:23:42,934
Why?

1235
01:23:44,937 --> 01:23:46,979
Should have wiped the floor
with that guy.

1236
01:23:47,106 --> 01:23:48,314
Yeah, so?

1237
01:23:49,441 --> 01:23:51,734
How much would you need to
go from here to Atlantic City?

1238
01:23:51,944 --> 01:23:52,985
A couple thousand?

1239
01:23:54,780 --> 01:23:57,031
Come on, Eddie,
you've had a little too much to drink.

1240
01:23:57,116 --> 01:23:58,950
Let's go back to the motel
and forget about it.

1241
01:23:59,702 --> 01:24:02,453
I got nothing left to teach you, kid.
That was the last lesson in here.

1242
01:24:03,455 --> 01:24:07,375
Come on, take the money.
Front for yourself. You'll do fine.

1243
01:24:08,794 --> 01:24:10,503
What are you talking, man?
Are you walking off?

1244
01:24:10,671 --> 01:24:11,921
You're dumping us?

1245
01:24:12,005 --> 01:24:13,881
Dumping you? I'm giving you a stake.

1246
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:17,635
I showed you all I got.
I showed you my ass in here!

1247
01:24:17,720 --> 01:24:19,387
And what the hell else do you want?

1248
01:24:19,471 --> 01:24:20,805
That's it, that's all.

1249
01:24:24,101 --> 01:24:26,018
What are we supposed to do?

1250
01:24:26,103 --> 01:24:27,895
Where are we supposed to
go from here?

1251
01:24:27,980 --> 01:24:29,856
Well, here is you, see?

1252
01:24:29,940 --> 01:24:32,567
Here is Atlantic City.
In between is about 27 pool halls.

1253
01:24:32,651 --> 01:24:33,901
Three weeks,
a couple thousand dollars.

1254
01:24:33,986 --> 01:24:36,320
What the hell else do you need,
an Indian guide? Use your brains!

1255
01:24:36,405 --> 01:24:37,655
Why are you talking to us
this way, huh?

1256
01:24:37,740 --> 01:24:39,490
Some guy comes in here
and plays you for a chump,

1257
01:24:39,575 --> 01:24:41,242
so you walk out on us?

1258
01:24:41,326 --> 01:24:43,953
I mean, come on,
we'll get this guy next time, Eddie.

1259
01:24:46,832 --> 01:24:47,832
Hey, hey.

1260
01:24:50,669 --> 01:24:51,919
You do this to some guy on the street,

1261
01:24:52,004 --> 01:24:53,087
you don't do this to me.

1262
01:24:53,172 --> 01:24:56,632
What about all the stuff you told me,
we talked about, me and you, huh?

1263
01:24:56,717 --> 01:24:58,676
- You're going to ruin everything here!
- Get out of here!

1264
01:24:58,761 --> 01:25:01,679
Carmen and me.
What you told me about that?

1265
01:25:01,764 --> 01:25:05,141
Okay, look, Eddie.
It's my attitude, right?

1266
01:25:05,267 --> 01:25:07,810
- Okay, from now on...
- Attitude, bullshit!

1267
01:25:08,020 --> 01:25:10,354
Kiddo, you always do
what you want to do.

1268
01:25:10,439 --> 01:25:12,440
- Don't tell me that.
- If I say you do this, you do that.

1269
01:25:12,524 --> 01:25:14,275
- Don't tell me that. I try to do everything.
- I'm tired!

1270
01:25:14,359 --> 01:25:16,277
I try to do everything
that you tell me to do!

1271
01:25:16,361 --> 01:25:18,821
You don't need me anymore.
Take the money.

1272
01:25:19,364 --> 01:25:22,200
- It's the last thing I got left to give you.
- Let it go, Vincent!

1273
01:25:23,827 --> 01:25:25,286
You want to give me money
and get rid of me.

1274
01:25:25,370 --> 01:25:27,288
You're young, kid.
You've got a long way to go.

1275
01:25:27,372 --> 01:25:28,414
You wanna give me money?
Then give me money.

1276
01:25:28,499 --> 01:25:30,249
'Cause this is nickel and dime shit
you've been giving me...

1277
01:25:30,375 --> 01:25:32,001
I'll give you money,
but don't you tell me what I'm about.

1278
01:25:32,085 --> 01:25:34,712
- Just shut up and give me the money.
- Make it $3,000. It's our money.

1279
01:25:34,797 --> 01:25:36,881
- Yeah, it's my fucking money anyway!
- I'll give you what I've got.

1280
01:25:36,965 --> 01:25:38,216
I'll give you what I got!

1281
01:25:39,551 --> 01:25:41,761
You know something?
Just keep your fucking money, pal.

1282
01:25:45,057 --> 01:25:46,307
Fuck it!

1283
01:25:48,894 --> 01:25:50,186
Fuck!

1284
01:25:57,569 --> 01:25:58,694
Here.

1285
01:26:01,615 --> 01:26:02,615
Yeah, well...

1286
01:27:15,647 --> 01:27:17,440
Feel good, don't it?

1287
01:27:18,609 --> 01:27:21,110
- I'm blind.
- You're cool.

1288
01:27:35,542 --> 01:27:40,004
Better? Same? Worse?
- Better.

1289
01:27:41,465 --> 01:27:45,468
- Better? Same? Worse?
- Better.

1290
01:27:47,262 --> 01:27:49,513
Better? Same? Worse?

1291
01:28:44,486 --> 01:28:46,570
- I like the glasses.
- Yeah?

1292
01:28:47,698 --> 01:28:50,741
Fast Eddie, this here's Moselle.
He plays pool.

1293
01:28:50,867 --> 01:28:54,787
- No kidding.
- That's a nice stick.

1294
01:28:55,038 --> 01:28:58,332
I get the break. What's the book?

1295
01:28:58,917 --> 01:29:03,129
Fifty on Fast Eddie wins you 100.
Fifty on Moselle wins you 25.

1296
01:29:03,213 --> 01:29:04,422
Well, thanks.

1297
01:29:04,756 --> 01:29:06,257
Facts of life, man.

1298
01:29:06,633 --> 01:29:09,552
- A hundred on the side?
- Read my mind.

1299
01:29:09,803 --> 01:29:11,262
Rack them up.

1300
01:31:24,855 --> 01:31:27,022
You guys going to Atlantic City?

1301
01:31:51,590 --> 01:31:53,507
...on the
boardwalk in Atlantic City

1302
01:31:53,592 --> 01:31:56,051
welcomes you to our casino.

1303
01:31:57,345 --> 01:31:58,554
As anyone can tell you,

1304
01:31:59,764 --> 01:32:02,183
the greatest single secret to success
on the casino floor

1305
01:32:02,267 --> 01:32:04,018
is knowing how to play the game.

1306
01:32:04,644 --> 01:32:07,479
There are slot machines,
roulette, blackjack,

1307
01:32:07,564 --> 01:32:10,524
craps, big six and baccarat tables.

1308
01:32:21,494 --> 01:32:24,121
The rules, regulations
and pay-out odds

1309
01:32:24,206 --> 01:32:26,207
are established and supervised

1310
01:32:26,291 --> 01:32:28,542
by the New Jersey Casino
Control Commission.

1311
01:32:46,144 --> 01:32:47,269
Knock 'em dead.

1312
01:32:47,979 --> 01:32:49,480
Gonna try.

1313
01:33:57,257 --> 01:33:58,882
Hey, Eddie.

1314
01:34:01,219 --> 01:34:04,388
- What?
- You playing?

1315
01:34:04,889 --> 01:34:07,266
- Yeah. You got a problem with that?
- I don't got any problem with that.

1316
01:34:07,350 --> 01:34:09,643
- You got any problem with that?
- I ain't got no problems.

1317
01:34:10,061 --> 01:34:11,562
If it makes you happy, do it.

1318
01:34:14,899 --> 01:34:16,317
Just wanted to say hello.

1319
01:34:21,072 --> 01:34:25,743
Hello. Test, test.
One, two, three, one, test.

1320
01:34:33,710 --> 01:34:37,421
Ladies and gentlemen, it's nice to
see so many faces here

1321
01:34:37,505 --> 01:34:40,841
for today's 9-ball Classic.

1322
01:34:45,597 --> 01:34:47,639
Players, start your matches.

1323
01:34:58,860 --> 01:35:00,736
I didn't deserve that.

1324
01:35:05,200 --> 01:35:07,284
Is this your first tournament, Duke?

1325
01:35:17,170 --> 01:35:21,131
Match to Mr. Felson.
Eleven games to five.

1326
01:35:25,261 --> 01:35:27,304
I didn't deserve that.

1327
01:35:27,931 --> 01:35:29,848
Yes, you did.

1328
01:35:41,528 --> 01:35:45,280
Tall and tan
and young and handsome

1329
01:35:45,365 --> 01:35:48,992
The boy from Ipanema goes walking

1330
01:35:49,077 --> 01:35:52,663
And when he passes,
Each girl he passes

1331
01:35:52,956 --> 01:35:56,291
Goes, "Ah"

1332
01:35:57,377 --> 01:35:58,544
We'll play 10 games.

1333
01:35:58,628 --> 01:36:00,712
You only have to win eight,
I gotta win 10.

1334
01:36:00,797 --> 01:36:03,924
And I'll put up $1,200
and you only have to put up $800.

1335
01:36:04,008 --> 01:36:04,967
Okay, wait a minute.

1336
01:36:05,051 --> 01:36:06,468
I only have to win eight games
to your 10?

1337
01:36:06,553 --> 01:36:07,553
That's right.

1338
01:36:07,637 --> 01:36:09,096
And you're gonna put up $1,200
to my $800?

1339
01:36:09,180 --> 01:36:10,180
That's right.

1340
01:36:10,265 --> 01:36:11,390
Carmen, that sounds like a good deal.

1341
01:36:11,474 --> 01:36:12,891
- It is a good deal, isn't it?
- It is a good deal.

1342
01:36:12,976 --> 01:36:15,769
This guy won the Akron Open, Vincent.
Don't be a jerk.

1343
01:36:15,854 --> 01:36:17,271
There is no such thing
as the Akron Open.

1344
01:36:17,355 --> 01:36:18,313
Where did you hear that?

1345
01:36:18,398 --> 01:36:20,107
No? What have I been reading about?

1346
01:36:20,191 --> 01:36:21,859
Hey, Carmen.
I can win eight games here.

1347
01:36:21,943 --> 01:36:23,110
Don't blow this. Let me play this guy...

1348
01:36:23,194 --> 01:36:24,736
No, I know you can,
I'm not gonna blow it.

1349
01:36:24,821 --> 01:36:26,822
- I just don't like the deal.
- What don't you like about it, lady?

1350
01:36:26,906 --> 01:36:28,407
I think maybe you should
up your end to about 1,500.

1351
01:36:28,491 --> 01:36:29,616
- Up my end?
- That's right.

1352
01:36:29,701 --> 01:36:32,995
$300, Vincent.
It's not gonna kill the guy, 1,500.

1353
01:36:36,916 --> 01:36:39,001
All right, all right.
I'll tell you what, I shouldn't, but I will.

1354
01:36:39,085 --> 01:36:40,669
$1,500, how's that?

1355
01:36:40,753 --> 01:36:42,212
- Is that a deal?
- Okay, yeah.

1356
01:36:42,547 --> 01:36:46,425
- Sorry about...
- Don't be sorry, it's all right. It's 8:30.

1357
01:36:46,509 --> 01:36:48,844
I got a few things to do.
How about 12:30 in the green room?

1358
01:36:48,928 --> 01:36:51,054
-12:30. Great.
- Terrific.

1359
01:36:53,475 --> 01:36:55,726
- You can get these, right?
- No problem.

1360
01:36:55,810 --> 01:36:57,102
We got it covered.

1361
01:37:01,274 --> 01:37:03,484
- $1,500?
- Not bad, huh.

1362
01:37:03,568 --> 01:37:05,986
- Not bad, huh?
- He wouldn't go for more.

1363
01:37:06,070 --> 01:37:09,198
You wouldn't go for more. That guy
had $2,000 written all over his face.

1364
01:37:09,282 --> 01:37:12,117
You just gave him $500,
and you're gonna buy his drink, too?

1365
01:37:12,202 --> 01:37:14,495
- Thank you!
- Why don't you do it yourself next time?

1366
01:37:14,579 --> 01:37:15,579
Hey!

1367
01:37:24,005 --> 01:37:25,589
I gotta go rest.

1368
01:37:28,968 --> 01:37:29,968
Hey!

1369
01:37:33,306 --> 01:37:35,390
Got new glasses, huh? They look good.

1370
01:37:35,475 --> 01:37:37,100
Well, it's Vincent the Kid and Carmen.

1371
01:37:37,185 --> 01:37:39,228
Hey, Eddie.
You looked real good today.

1372
01:37:39,312 --> 01:37:42,105
- So how's it going?
- Can't complain. How about you?

1373
01:37:42,315 --> 01:37:43,982
$4,000 in three weeks.

1374
01:37:44,108 --> 01:37:45,734
I guess it could have been better,
could have been worse.

1375
01:37:46,528 --> 01:37:48,237
All right. I'm happy for you.

1376
01:37:48,696 --> 01:37:50,989
At 12:30 in the green room, we're
gonna take out that lame from Akron.

1377
01:37:51,074 --> 01:37:52,991
Did you see what we did to that guy?

1378
01:37:53,076 --> 01:37:57,120
- You want in on it?
- Well, thanks.

1379
01:37:58,164 --> 01:38:01,041
Listen, I'll pass up on that.
I gotta play at 10:00.

1380
01:38:01,125 --> 01:38:04,086
- I'm just packing it in early.
- All right. It's on you.

1381
01:38:05,797 --> 01:38:07,214
- Good luck tomorrow.
- Same to you.

1382
01:38:07,298 --> 01:38:08,632
Thank you.

1383
01:38:09,801 --> 01:38:11,426
I gotta go rest.

1384
01:38:12,971 --> 01:38:15,222
Come and get me
in about three hours, okay?

1385
01:38:15,890 --> 01:38:17,432
- In three?
- Yeah, yeah.

1386
01:38:20,270 --> 01:38:23,814
- Going good?
- Yeah, we're doing okay.

1387
01:38:25,567 --> 01:38:27,985
You were right, you know,
we really didn't need you anymore.

1388
01:38:28,152 --> 01:38:29,778
That's what I said.

1389
01:38:29,862 --> 01:38:32,864
You wouldn't believe Vincent now.
You wouldn't even recognize him.

1390
01:38:33,157 --> 01:38:34,658
A new man, huh?

1391
01:38:35,952 --> 01:38:37,661
Why didn't you take him up on tonight?

1392
01:38:37,745 --> 01:38:40,581
Well, like I said,
I gotta get up early and play, so...

1393
01:38:44,252 --> 01:38:46,336
All right. See you around.

1394
01:39:44,395 --> 01:39:46,188
It's like a nightmare, isn't it?

1395
01:39:47,523 --> 01:39:49,524
You got lucky, you lucky prick.

1396
01:40:11,756 --> 01:40:13,924
Wipe your nose, will you, Julian.

1397
01:40:14,092 --> 01:40:15,759
You're going down, Eddie.

1398
01:40:24,769 --> 01:40:29,731
Oh, goddamn. Jesus Christ!

1399
01:40:29,982 --> 01:40:32,442
Yeah, and it just keeps getting worse
and worse, doesn't it?

1400
01:40:32,819 --> 01:40:34,736
Take it on off. I can't help it.

1401
01:40:40,451 --> 01:40:41,451
Eddie?

1402
01:40:42,453 --> 01:40:44,413
- Nice game, Eddie.
- Thank you.

1403
01:40:44,956 --> 01:40:47,124
- Eddie, nice game.
- Good game.

1404
01:40:55,925 --> 01:40:58,218
I'm doing fine, yeah.

1405
01:40:58,594 --> 01:41:00,762
I'm only feeling nervous,
because I feel good.

1406
01:41:02,181 --> 01:41:04,975
Yeah, eyes feel good, legs feel great.

1407
01:41:06,644 --> 01:41:09,646
I got no grief down here. Come on
down here and give me some grief.

1408
01:41:10,940 --> 01:41:14,067
Forget the Bahamas, this is it, okay?

1409
01:41:15,695 --> 01:41:17,529
It would be good having you here.

1410
01:42:04,243 --> 01:42:05,243
Hey!

1411
01:42:07,455 --> 01:42:09,790
I'm going to beat him, you know.

1412
01:42:14,420 --> 01:42:15,587
Maybe.

1413
01:42:20,051 --> 01:42:21,218
Hello, Eddie.

1414
01:42:40,988 --> 01:42:42,239
That's nice.

1415
01:42:52,250 --> 01:42:54,584
...Brian Albrecht and
Larry Schwartz.

1416
01:42:58,339 --> 01:43:03,343
The final match on Table Number 8,
Vincent Lauria and Eddie Felson.

1417
01:46:23,085 --> 01:46:24,961
Hey, you shot a great game.

1418
01:46:29,967 --> 01:46:32,052
Well, the balls roll funny for everybody,
I told you that.

1419
01:46:32,136 --> 01:46:34,012
I mean, you shot a great game.

1420
01:47:18,307 --> 01:47:19,974
- Come on.
- Eddie!

1421
01:47:23,062 --> 01:47:25,063
- Who is it?
- Vincent.

1422
01:47:35,199 --> 01:47:38,118
- Hi, guys.
- I'm sorry. Should we come back later?

1423
01:47:38,202 --> 01:47:43,748
No, we were just... Janelle's having
a glass of early bubbly. Come on in.

1424
01:47:45,709 --> 01:47:50,505
Listen, I drew this guy Kennedy,
uh, in the semi-finals.

1425
01:47:50,589 --> 01:47:52,507
You know anything about him?

1426
01:47:55,678 --> 01:47:57,595
- What's that?
- It's for you.

1427
01:47:58,013 --> 01:48:00,223
Hey, how you doing? It's your cut.

1428
01:48:00,599 --> 01:48:02,267
- Cut of what?
- For the game.

1429
01:48:02,893 --> 01:48:04,936
- What game?
- Our game, man, I dumped.

1430
01:48:05,229 --> 01:48:07,730
I got a front to lay off $4,000 on you,
and then I dumped.

1431
01:48:08,232 --> 01:48:10,316
All I had to do was dog about four shots,
you know?

1432
01:48:10,943 --> 01:48:13,611
But, Eddie, you know something,
you are a very, very good player.

1433
01:48:14,613 --> 01:48:17,657
I feel shitty about getting booted,
but there are other tournaments, right?

1434
01:48:17,741 --> 01:48:18,741
Right.

1435
01:48:20,327 --> 01:48:21,411
You dumped, huh?

1436
01:48:21,495 --> 01:48:23,913
Carmen didn't wanna go for it,
but I told her, hey, you'd appreciate it.

1437
01:48:23,998 --> 01:48:26,583
I mean, of all people,
there's $8,000 in there.

1438
01:48:27,626 --> 01:48:30,461
After I beat Grady Seasons, the odds
between me and him were a joke.

1439
01:48:31,046 --> 01:48:33,673
Two brothers and a stranger, Eddie,
just like you laid it out, you know.

1440
01:48:33,757 --> 01:48:37,010
It was beautiful, it was just...
It was fucking beautiful.

1441
01:48:37,094 --> 01:48:38,678
When I banked the five...

1442
01:48:38,762 --> 01:48:41,222
When I saw the lay of the table,
I knew that it was gonna be the five.

1443
01:48:41,348 --> 01:48:44,225
That's the art of the dump, right?
To be able to just

1444
01:48:45,186 --> 01:48:47,020
miss the pocket by a hair.

1445
01:48:47,104 --> 01:48:49,564
I mean, the audience, "Oh!" It was...

1446
01:48:49,648 --> 01:48:51,191
It was... I...

1447
01:48:51,734 --> 01:48:53,318
$8,000 in there.

1448
01:48:56,697 --> 01:48:58,198
We gotta split.

1449
01:48:58,282 --> 01:49:00,575
Look, I've got green room games
for the next three nights.

1450
01:49:00,659 --> 01:49:02,577
These guys,
they just won't leave me alone.

1451
01:49:02,661 --> 01:49:05,288
Are you sure you don't want in on this?
We're talking about a lot of money.

1452
01:49:05,998 --> 01:49:07,457
Yeah, maybe.

1453
01:49:08,459 --> 01:49:09,626
Okay.

1454
01:49:10,169 --> 01:49:14,172
I'll call you, okay?
Good luck with Kennedy, all right?

1455
01:49:19,762 --> 01:49:21,304
He's a little prick.

1456
01:49:23,474 --> 01:49:27,018
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's good to see you all here today

1457
01:49:27,102 --> 01:49:31,189
for the semi-finals
of today's 9-ball Classic.

1458
01:49:31,315 --> 01:49:35,944
The matches on Table 1 will
be between, from Chicago,

1459
01:49:36,028 --> 01:49:40,448
Larry Schwartz. Larry will be playing,
from Saint Louis, Missouri,

1460
01:49:40,658 --> 01:49:44,827
the incomparable Saint Louis Louie,
Louie Roberts.

1461
01:49:49,959 --> 01:49:55,338
On Table 2, this year's eastern states
regional nine-ball champion

1462
01:49:55,422 --> 01:49:58,049
Lorenzo Kennedy will be playing,

1463
01:49:58,133 --> 01:50:01,552
and we welcome back,
Fast Eddie Felson.

1464
01:50:05,933 --> 01:50:08,101
Players, begin your matches.

1465
01:50:51,353 --> 01:50:54,355
- What are you doing?
- I forfeit.

1466
01:50:54,606 --> 01:50:56,691
- Forfeit?
- Forfeit, Felson has forfeited his match.

1467
01:50:56,775 --> 01:50:59,319
What do you mean, forfeit?
You can't forfeit.

1468
01:50:59,403 --> 01:51:00,903
What's he talking about?
What kind of bullshit is this?

1469
01:51:00,988 --> 01:51:02,155
I don't know.
He just threw 50,000 away.

1470
01:51:02,239 --> 01:51:04,657
Come on, Eddie, don't forfeit.
I don't want to win like this.

1471
01:51:08,412 --> 01:51:11,122
Yeah, but I don't want to
win like that, though.

1472
01:51:30,434 --> 01:51:34,812
The match on Table 3
has been forfeited by Eddie Felson.

1473
01:51:35,647 --> 01:51:38,441
Lorenzo Kennedy wins by default.

1474
01:51:51,121 --> 01:51:53,956
So what do you say?
Why don't we get the hell out of here?

1475
01:51:57,294 --> 01:52:00,463
The Bahamas are looking real good
to me about now.

1476
01:52:02,549 --> 01:52:03,633
Anyway,

1477
01:52:04,259 --> 01:52:07,512
I got out of my lease.
All my stuff's in boxes.

1478
01:52:08,389 --> 01:52:09,806
That's nice.

1479
01:52:10,474 --> 01:52:13,309
I'm a real big fan of character in people.

1480
01:52:13,811 --> 01:52:15,478
I don't know if you knew that about me.

1481
01:52:15,938 --> 01:52:17,814
- Character, huh?
- Yeah.

1482
01:52:21,443 --> 01:52:22,944
Here it comes.

1483
01:52:36,708 --> 01:52:37,959
Vincent says this is yours.

1484
01:52:38,043 --> 01:52:40,002
You don't want it,
you should give it to charity.

1485
01:52:40,796 --> 01:52:42,338
What'll that solve?

1486
01:52:42,548 --> 01:52:45,174
I don't know.
I don't know anything anymore.

1487
01:52:45,843 --> 01:52:47,677
I want his best game.

1488
01:52:47,761 --> 01:52:50,596
Look, if you want his best game, Eddie,
go talk to him yourself.

1489
01:52:50,681 --> 01:52:52,098
He won't listen to me.

1490
01:52:52,182 --> 01:52:54,809
- What? So I gotta cover your ass now?
- No.

1491
01:52:55,936 --> 01:52:57,019
You gotta save it.

1492
01:52:57,938 --> 01:52:59,605
Why should I?

1493
01:53:03,068 --> 01:53:05,111
I'll be in the green room.

1494
01:53:32,347 --> 01:53:33,723
Stings like a bitch, don't it?

1495
01:53:33,849 --> 01:53:35,308
Yes, it does.

1496
01:53:41,231 --> 01:53:43,900
You got brass, man. I'll give you that.

1497
01:53:44,193 --> 01:53:47,403
You want my game? You couldn't deal
with my game, Jack. You're outmanned.

1498
01:53:47,488 --> 01:53:50,364
Let's find out. I'm asking you.

1499
01:53:50,449 --> 01:53:52,742
I ain't got a leg to stand on,
but I'm asking you.

1500
01:53:52,826 --> 01:53:54,744
- Shove it!
- Don't do that, kid.

1501
01:53:54,828 --> 01:53:57,205
I call the shots! I do what I want to do.

1502
01:53:57,289 --> 01:54:00,500
Don't do it.
I don't have that many games left in me.

1503
01:54:00,584 --> 01:54:03,961
God! You used us. You used me!

1504
01:54:04,046 --> 01:54:05,630
Yes, I did.

1505
01:54:05,756 --> 01:54:08,424
But you're in Atlantic City now,
with the big boys.

1506
01:54:08,967 --> 01:54:12,512
You're not back there in the stock room
playing around with baby dolls.

1507
01:54:12,596 --> 01:54:13,596
Think about it.

1508
01:54:14,431 --> 01:54:15,848
It's a wash.

1509
01:54:18,602 --> 01:54:22,563
And about all that other stuff,
I don't take much pride in that.

1510
01:54:22,856 --> 01:54:25,733
It's even, but it ain't settled.
Let's settle it.

1511
01:54:25,817 --> 01:54:28,986
- Why should I?
- How long do you want me to fry, huh?

1512
01:54:29,071 --> 01:54:30,279
Five years, 10 years?

1513
01:54:30,405 --> 01:54:32,782
You want to play
kick the dog for the rest of your life?

1514
01:54:34,826 --> 01:54:36,953
Come on, let's clean it up.

1515
01:54:53,512 --> 01:54:56,347
Listen to this. What? You want to
play for the envelope? Is that it?

1516
01:54:56,431 --> 01:54:57,682
Whatever.

1517
01:55:13,699 --> 01:55:14,907
Thank you.

1518
01:55:20,330 --> 01:55:23,124
Eddie, what are you gonna do
when I kick your ass?

1519
01:55:23,208 --> 01:55:25,918
Pick myself up
and let you kick me again.

1520
01:55:28,046 --> 01:55:30,256
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1521
01:55:32,509 --> 01:55:34,802
Just don't put the money
in the bank, kid.

1522
01:55:34,886 --> 01:55:36,053
'Cause if I don't whip you now,

1523
01:55:36,138 --> 01:55:37,930
I'm gonna whip you next month
in Dallas.

1524
01:55:38,015 --> 01:55:40,766
You mean Houston.
There's nothing coming up in Dallas.

1525
01:55:40,851 --> 01:55:45,187
Houston, Dallas. And if not then, then
the month after that in New Orleans.

1526
01:55:45,272 --> 01:55:47,565
Oh, yeah? What makes you so sure?

1527
01:55:53,655 --> 01:55:55,740
Hey, I'm back.

1528
01:57:08,105 --> 01:57:12,983
I feel so doggone lonely

1529
01:57:15,278 --> 01:57:20,032
Todayjust isn't my day

1530
01:57:22,452 --> 01:57:26,956
When I got home this morning

1531
01:57:29,501 --> 01:57:34,380
I found a letter on my bed

1532
01:57:36,174 --> 01:57:40,970
When I opened up that letter

1533
01:57:43,640 --> 01:57:47,852
I broke right down and cried

1534
01:57:51,148 --> 01:57:55,735
She said, "Now, Daddy,
I hate to leave you

1535
01:57:57,320 --> 01:58:01,574
"But I'm in love
with another guy"

1536
01:58:06,997 --> 01:58:09,832
I couldn't believe she wrote it

1537
01:58:11,460 --> 01:58:17,047
So I read it over again

1538
01:58:18,800 --> 01:58:23,763
And when I was finished

1539
01:58:26,433 --> 01:58:30,770
The tears came down like rain

1540
01:58:33,315 --> 01:58:37,359
The more I read
this doggone letter

1541
01:58:40,781 --> 01:58:45,159
The more my
poor heart cries

1542
01:58:47,788 --> 01:58:52,082
She said, "Now, Daddy,
I hate to leave you

1543
01:58:53,960 --> 01:58:58,631
"But I'm in love
with another guy"

1544
01:58:59,925 --> 01:59:02,384
My baby, she said

1545
01:59:04,805 --> 01:59:07,556
Oh, yeah,
My baby, she said

1546
01:59:08,558 --> 01:59:12,770
My baby, she said

1547
01:59:13,897 --> 01:59:15,856
This what she said

1548
01:59:16,566 --> 01:59:19,944
She said, "Now, Daddy,
I hate to leave you

1549
01:59:22,572 --> 01:59:27,076
"But I'm in love
with another guy"
