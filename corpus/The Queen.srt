the youngest PM this century.'

9
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,678
- Have you voted yet, Mr. Crawford?
- Yes, Ma'am.

10
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,998
I was there when they opened.
First in line, seven o'clock.

11
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,398
I don't mind telling you,
it wasn't for Mr. Blair.

12
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,429
- You're not a modernizer?
- Certainly not.

13
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:13,792
We're in danger of losing too much
that is good about this country.

14
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,559
There is a growing sense
of excitement.

15
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:22,873
I envy you, being able to vote.
Not the actual ticking of the box,

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,788
although it would be nice
to experience that once...

17
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,598
...but the sheer joy of being partial.

18
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:36,238
Yes. Of course, one forgets that as
sovereign, you're not entitled to vote.

19
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:40,512
- No.
- Still, I don't feel sorry for you.

20
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,154
You might not be allowed to vote,
ma'am...

21
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,789
...but it is your government.

22
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,717
Yes.

23
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,071
I suppose that is some consolation.

24
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,951
Good morning.

25
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,038
- Shall I draw the curtains?
- Yes, please.

26
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,477
So, did you stay up all night?

27
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,999
Yes, ma'am.

28
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,271
And was it as expected?

29
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,073
Yes, ma'am. Mr. Blair.

30
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,191
By a landslide.

31
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,031
Oh, I see.

32
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,199
'They've stopped the traffic

'I guess they know it's

38
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,869
The Prime Minister is on his way,
ma'am.

39
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,231
To be, Robin. The Prime Minister to be.

40
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,351
I haven't asked him yet.

41
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,960
He's a hard one to read, isn't he?

42
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,755
Yes. On the one hand,
his background is quite establishment -

43
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,678
father a Conservative,
educated at Fettes.

44
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,553
He had the same tutor
as the Prince of Wales.

45
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,716
We'll try not to hold that against him.

46
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,149
On the other, his manifesto promises

47
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,671
the most radical shake-up
of the constitution in 300 years.

48
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:16,315
- Think he'll try to modernize us?
- I wouldn't put it past him.

49
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,796
His wife has
anti-monarchist sympathies.

50
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,673
You may remember her curtsy
the first time you met.

51
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,792
It could best be described as shallow.

52
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:29,674
I don't measure
the depth of a curtsy, Robin.

53
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,791
I leave that to my sister.

54
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,514
Downing Street
is expected to be informal -

55
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:38,758
everyone on first-name terms,
at the Prime Minister's insistence.

56
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,075
- What, "Call me Tony"?
- Yes, ma'am.

57
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,988
Oh, I don't like that.
Have we sent him a protocol sheet?

58
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,599
- Funny, I'm actually rather nervous.
- Why? You've met her before.

59
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,589
I know, but never one to one,
and never as Prime Minister.

60
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:08,032
Well, remember, you're a man
that's just been elected by the nation.

61
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:13,676
But she's still, you know, the Queen.

62
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,115
The audience room is upstairs.

63
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,833
When we reach the audience room,
I will knock.

64
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,599
We shall go straight inside.

65
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,757
Standing by the door, we bow,
from the neck.

66
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,553
I will introduce you.
The Queen will extend her hand.

67
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,310
You go to her, bow again,
then shake her hand.

68
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,276
A couple of other things -

69
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,391
it's ma'am as in ham,

70
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,670
not ma'am as in farm.

71
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,993
When you're in the presence,
at no point must you show your back.

72
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,111
- The presence?
- Yes, sir.

73
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:59,153
That's what it's called
when you're in Her Majesty's company.

74
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,713
Would you like to sit there, Mrs. Blair?

75
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,834
How nice to see you again, Mr. Blair.

76
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,990
- And congratulations.
- Thank you.

77
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,554
- Your children must be proud.
- I hope so.

78
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,831
- You've three, haven't you?
- That's right.

79
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,872
Such a blessing, children.
Do sit down.

80
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,797
Thank you.

81
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:48,870
Have we shown you
how to start a nuclear war yet?

82
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,709
- Er... no.
- Oh. First thing we do, apparently.

83
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:56,719
Then we take away your passport
and send you round the world.

84
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,513
You obviously know my job
better than I do.

85
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:03,633
Yes, well, you are
my tenth prime minister, Mr. Blair.

86
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,751
My first was Winston Churchill.

87
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:09,270
He sat in your chair
in a frock coat and top hat.

88
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:13,279
He was kind enough to give a young girl
like me quite an education.

89
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,436
I can imagine.

90
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:19,394
With time, one has hopefully added
experience and wisdom,

91
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:24,071
better enabling us to execute
our constitutional responsibility,

92
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:28,478
to advise, guide and warn
the government of the day.

93
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,831
Advice which I...
look forward to receiving.

94
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:35,555
Yes. We'll save that
for our weekly meetings.

95
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,793
If there's nothing else, I believe
we have some business to attend to.

96
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,871
Of course.

97
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,157
Your Majesty,
my party has won the election,

98
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,475
and so I ask your permission
to form a...

99
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,273
No, Mr. Blair. I ask the question.

100
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,314
The duty falls upon me, as sovereign,

101
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:02,831
to invite you to become Prime Minister
and to form a government in my name.

102
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:08,230
And if you agree,
the custom is to say yes.

103
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,351
Yes.

104
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,071
Mrs. Blair, lovely to see you again.

105
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,438
And congratulations.
You must be very proud.

106
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:40,393
- Yes.
- And exhausted, I imagine.

107
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,080
- Where will you spend the summer?
- France.

108
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,191
- Lovely.
- You'll be in Balmoral?

109
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,709
Yes. Wonderful place.

110
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,149
My great, great grandmother,
Victoria said,

111
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,919
"In Balmoral, all seems to breathe
freedom and peace

112
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,634
"and make one forget the world
and its sad turmoils."

113
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,593
- Your Majesty...
- Oh, excuse me.

114
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,389
No. Really?

115
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,154
Oh. Yes, of course.

116
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:11,192
I'm so sorry.
We're going to have to leave it there.

117
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,671
Not too short, was it, 15 minutes?

118
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,870
- One doesn't want to be rude.
- No, ma'am.

119
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,431
Morning.

120
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:36,916
- "Thanks for coming. Now, fuck off."
- What was that about?

121
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,838
God knows.
It'll be something to do with Diana.

122
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:43,034
'Princess Diana
embroiled in controversy

123
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,234
'as she pulls out of a meeting
with MPs.'

124
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:50,512
Princess Diana moved to mend relations
with the former nanny...

125
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,791
Princess Diana attended
a memorial service

126
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,275
for the fashion designer
Gianni Versace.

127
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,517
'...where another
royal controversy sparkles.'

128
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:03,394
...was embroiled
in a second controversy this week.

129
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,954
I am not a political figure.

130
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,311
Princess Diana sailed
out into the Mediterranean

131
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,273
in one of Mr. Mohamed AI Fayed's
yachts today.

132
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,119
- With his son.
- ...quarter of a million pounds

133
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,789
for photographs which appear
to show the couple embracing.

134
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,348
Once again,
her judgment's under scrutiny.

135
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,114
Earlier today, they visited the...

136
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,671
Robin Janvrin.

137
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,992
What?

138
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,634
Tell Sir Guy I want everyone in ASAP.

139
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,993
Ma'am? Ma'am?

140
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,070
- Yes?
- Ma'am, Mr. Janvrin is here to see you.

141
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,997
What?

142
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,471
Oh.

143
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,751
Good evening ma'am.

144
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:15,192
I'm sorry to disturb, but I've just had
a call from our embassy in Paris.

145
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:19,438
- It's the Princess of Wales.
- Why? What's she done now?

146
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:24,629
I see. Er...
Who are we speaking to there?

147
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,314
Right, well, keep me updated.

148
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:34,396
It's Diana.
She's been in a car accident in Paris.

149
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,715
Is it serious?

150
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,513
Apparently Dodi Fayed is dead.

151
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:43,076
'Let's recap on the details
of those injuries, Maxine.'

152
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,875
'They're saying the Princess is in
the intensive care unit

153
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,991
'of a southeast Paris hospital.

154
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,318
- 'She has concussion, a broken arm...'
- Why was she in Paris?

155
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,159
- I thought she was in London.
- You know what she's like.

156
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,470
Charles, isn't this awful?

157
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,594
- What will you do about the boys?
- Let them sleep until we know more.

158
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,757
- Yes, that's sensible.
- I should go to Paris.

159
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,871
I told my people to organize a jet.

160
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,191
- What, a private one?
- Yes.

161
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,676
Isn't that the sort of extravagance
they attack us for?

162
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:23,190
How else can I get to Paris
at this time of night?

163
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,835
Charles, dear, use the royal flight.

164
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:30,077
They keep one plane
on permanent standby

165
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,191
in case I should kick the bucket.

166
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,073
No, Mummy, he can't.
This isn't a matter of state.

167
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,191
What are you talking about?

168
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:40,790
Diana is not one of the royal family.
She's not an HRH.

169
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:44,310
- It's a private matter.
- She's mother to your grandchildren.

170
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,431
What is happening now?

171
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,075
I don't know. I can't hear.
Everyone's shouting.

172
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,990
- Thanks for coming in.
- The ambassador from Paris.

173
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,877
Good evening, sir.

174
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,151
Yes?

175
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,229
I've just spoken
to our ambassador in Paris, ma'am.

176
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,351
I'm afraid it's not good news.

177
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,471
No!

178
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,037
No...

179
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,030
No. No. No.

180
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,591
No.

181
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:47,358
Diana, Princess of Wales, has died
after a car crash in Paris.

182
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,916
The French government announced
her death this morning.

183
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:55,909
- What have I got on this week?
- Writing your conference speeches.

184
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,270
Well, let's cancel everything else.

185
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:02,317
This is going to be massive.

186
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,829
'Her death was confirmed
by the French...'

187
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:09,909
- I'll make a statement in the morning.
- I've started coming up with ideas.

188
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:14,397
- She's only been dead an hour.
- Would you prefer I didn't?

189
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:32,472
Try and be very brave.

190
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,596
It's Mummy. She's dead.

191
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,560
They're going to go back to sleep.

192
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,551
Try, anyway.

193
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,951
My private secretary's office have
found a travel agency in New York

194
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:08,074
that will sell me a flight to Paris
with an hour's stopover in Manchester.

195
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:13,797
Perhaps you might consider
if it's an extravagance

196
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:19,119
to bring back the mother of the future
king of England in one of our planes.

197
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,879
All right. Of course.

198
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:38,110
John, I don't want the boys
to see the news and get upset.

199
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,199
Take the radio from the bedroom
and the TV from the nursery.

200
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,912
Yes, ma'am.

201
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,438
- Well, well, well.
- Yes.

202
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,156
Are you all right?

203
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,912
Your sister called, from Tuscany.

204
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:05,077
I hope you told her
to cut her holiday short.

205
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,839
- I did.
- I can't imagine she was pleased.

206
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:12,272
- That's putting it mildly.
- What did she say?

207
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,870
Something about Diana being more
annoying dead than alive.

208
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,594
Never let the boys hear you talk
like that.

209
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,870
Of course.

210
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:26,313
Something to help you go down?

211
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:29,432
No, I think I'll write my diary
a little longer.

212
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:34,310
Fine. I'm going to bed.

213
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,152
'We've heard nothing official
from the palace.

214
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,272
'We don't know when we'll get
any statements from the palace

215
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,550
'or when the royal family are due.'

216
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:19,552
That's how she will remain,
in our minds, our hearts, forever.

217
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:22,956
- OK? Got it.
- 'Where will you do it?'

218
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:26,709
- At the church, on the way in.
- I'll organize it.

219
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:29,400
'Viscount Althorp, Diana's brother...'

220
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,954
Hang on. I want to watch this.

221
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:37,316
'This is not a time
for recriminations, but for sadness.

222
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,956
'However, I would say I always believed
the press would kill her in the end.

223
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,755
'Not even I imagined they would take
such a direct hand in her death

224
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,474
'as seems to be the case.

225
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:52,593
'It would appear that every proprietor
and editor of every publication

226
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:57,510
'that paid for intrusive photographs
of her has blood on his hands today.'

227
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:01,269
Not the press, mate.
You've got the wrong villain.

228
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,595
Tony...

229
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,075
- Oh. Got to go.
- You about to speak to the Queen?

230
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,237
- Yeah.
- Ask her if she greased the brakes.

231
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,476
Now, now.

232
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,631
Thanks.

233
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,593
- Hello?
- 'Putting you through.'

234
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,598
Oh... Right, OK.

235
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,474
- Is the Prince of Wales with the boys?
- Yes, ma'am.

236
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,195
- Good. And he's going to Paris?
- Yes.

237
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:42,877
I'm sorry to disturb, ma'am...
Ma'am...

238
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,675
...but I have the Prime Minister
for you, from his constituency.

239
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,836
Lucky you.

240
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,873
Thank you, Robin.
I'll take it in the study.

241
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,510
- 'Your Majesty.'
- Prime Minister.

242
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,474
May I say how very sorry I am.

243
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:12,275
The thoughts and prayers of my family
are with you at this terrible time,

244
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,391
and with the princes in particular.

245
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,829
Thank you.

246
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:22,114
'Is it your intention to make
some kind of appearance or statement?'

247
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,959
No. No, certainly not.

248
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:30,631
No-one in the royal family will speak
publicly. This is a private matter.

249
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:33,558
We would appreciate it
if it could be respected as such.

250
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,671
I see.

251
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:41,270
I don't suppose
anyone's thought about the funeral.

252
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:45,916
We've spoken with the Spencer family,
and it is their express wish

253
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:50,079
that this should be a private funeral
with a memorial service to follow.

254
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,519
Right.

255
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:54,791
As Diana was no longer
a member of the royal family,

256
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:57,480
we must respect their wishes.

257
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,192
I see.

258
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:05,839
'You don't feel that in view
of her high profile and popularity,'

259
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:10,590
it might be an idea to pay tribute
to her life and achievements,

260
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,359
or even just to her as a mother?

261
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:16,472
Well, as I said,
it's her family's wish.

262
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:20,752
And the public, ma'am,
the British people?

263
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,838
'You don't think
that might be denying them a chance...'

264
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,552
A chance to what?

265
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,791
'To share in the grief?'

266
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:34,709
This is a family funeral, Mr. Blair,
not a fairground attraction.

267
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:38,389
I think the Princess has already paid
a high enough price

268
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:41,239
for exposure to the press, don't you?

269
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:45,433
If there's nothing else,
the children have to be looked after.

270
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:48,313
Of course. Goodbye, Your Maj...

271
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:00,429
Her instinct is to do nothing,

272
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:03,757
say nothing,
and give her a private funeral.

273
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:07,031
Are you surprised? She hated her guts.

274
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,151
I think it's a mistake.

275
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,431
They screwed up her life.
I hope they don't screw up her death.

276
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,551
Where can I get a black tie?

277
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,991
Oh, the chaplain called.

278
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:21,078
He asked if he should make
any changes in the service,

279
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,191
any special mention of Diana.

280
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,117
What did you say?

281
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:28,755
- I told him not to change a thing.
- Quite right.

282
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,111
The less attention drawn to it,
the better, for the boys.

283
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,832
Yes.

284
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:37,236
We should find some company
for them, some young people.

285
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,511
I'll take them for a long walk
up Craggy Head.

286
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,915
Yes, but no guns, Philip. It is Sunday.

287
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:52,513
We're going, I believe, to Sedgefield,
the Prime Minister's constituency,

288
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,234
where he is about to make a statement.

289
00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:00,514
'Yes, the Prime Minister coming now
with his wife, Cherie.'

290
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,437
Yeah, well, apart from that?

291
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:05,757
He's on. Alastair, he's on! Come on!

292
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:12,319
'Though her own life
was often sadly touched by tragedy,

293
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:15,796
'she touched the lives of so many others'

294
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:19,913
in Britain and throughout the world...

295
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:24,037
...with joy and with comfort.

296
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:30,919
'The people everywhere,
not just here in Britain, everywhere,

297
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,190
'they kept faith with Princess Diana.

298
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,670
'They liked her. They loved her.

299
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,037
'They regarded her as one of the people.

300
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:46,149
'She was the people's princess...

301
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,400
'...and that's how she will... stay,

302
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:55,114
'how she will remain...

303
00:24:55,240 --> 00:25:00,030
'...in our hearts
and in our memories... forever.'

304
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:03,197
A bit over the top, don't you think?

305
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:07,313
'The Prime Minister, paying
his tribute to the Princess of Wales.'

306
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:12,912
The people of Britain, he said,
kept faith with Princess Diana.

307
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,759
They loved her.
She was the people's princess.

308
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:27,274
- Do we have the Royal Standard?
- Yes, sir.

309
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,391
- And flowers?
- Yes, sir.

310
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:33,593
If we left it to the royal undertakers,
they'd bring her back in a crate.

311
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,553
Hello?

312
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:27,797
'This is Lord Airlie.
May I speak to the Prime Minister?'

313
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,309
One moment, please.
Lord Airlie.

314
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,829
The Lord Chamberlain
in charge of the funeral.

315
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,758
You're meeting him at the airport.

316
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,474
- Lord Airlie.
- Good afternoon, Prime Minister.

317
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:42,070
It's my job to organize
all the ceremonial events.

318
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:45,556
There's no precedent
for the funeral of an ex-HRH.

319
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:48,956
Perhaps we should plan
for any contingency.

320
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:52,152
I propose a meeting tomorrow morning
at Buckingham Palace,

321
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:57,070
'officials from all three palaces,
representatives of the Spencer family,'

322
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,317
the emergency services
and your people.

323
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,670
Absolutely. Of course.

324
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:10,435
Precedent?
Where do they find these people?

325
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,151
Thank you.

326
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,191
Brigadier Sir Charles Wood.

327
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,751
Air Commodore Wessex.

328
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,433
- Prime Minister.
- I'm so sorry, sir.

329
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:39,199
If there's anything
I or my government can do...

330
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:43,916
They stood up as we drove past,
in cafés, in restaurants,

331
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:46,031
removed their hats.

332
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:49,197
This was Paris,
and you could hear a pin drop.

333
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:53,598
- I imagine it will be the same here.
- The palace prefers a private funeral.

334
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:57,315
- What are your feelings on that?
- I...

335
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:03,271
I think that'll present us
with difficulties.

336
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,436
So do I.

337
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:10,918
My mother... The Queen comes
from a generation not best equipped.

338
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,031
She grew up in the war.

339
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,833
I think what we need,
what this country needs,

340
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:19,316
is a more modern perspective,
if you follow.

341
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:23,274
- Balmoral is...
- I think I understand.

342
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:32,068
'An aircraft of the Queen's Flight
brought the Princess's body home,

343
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:36,637
'where the Prime Minister gathered
with members of his government.

344
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:39,479
'A black hearse crossed the Tarmac

345
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,751
'and a Royal Air Force guard of honor
moved forward.'

346
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,919
Has anyone heard from the Spencers?
Did they say when the funeral will be?

347
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:51,999
Hmm? I don't know.
Nobody tells me anything.

348
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:55,157
'President Clinton
heard the news last night.'

349
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,713
'We liked her very much.

350
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:01,709
'We admired her work for children,
for people with AIDS

351
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,229
'for ending the scourge
of land mines...'

352
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:08,911
On our walk today, one of the gillies
said he'd seen a stag up Craggy Head.

353
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,953
- He reckoned 14 points.
- Oh.

354
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:17,517
We haven't had one
as big as that on the estate for years.

355
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:20,712
No. Quite.

356
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:24,435
'...and I was tremendously impressed...'

357
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:28,155
Anyway, I thought
it might be a good distraction.

358
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,589
- For the boys.
- What, stalking?

359
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:35,309
- You don't think it's too soon?
- Anything that gets them out is good.

360
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:40,474
'...as their relationship
deteriorated,

361
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:43,114
'she became increasingly unhappy.

362
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:46,038
'The couple divorced
in August of last year.

363
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:53,350
'Their love story
brought crowds into the streets.

364
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,994
'They came to see the Queen
and the Prince,

365
00:29:56,120 --> 00:30:00,033
'but most of all,
they came to see Diana.'

366
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:04,233
- I'm going to bed.
- 'But the fairytale was destined...'

367
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,150
I'll ring the Lord Chamberlain's office

368
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:27,909
to say we'll send representatives
to the meeting.

369
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:30,031
Thank you, Stephen.

370
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,359
She gave us so much.

371
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:47,519
Why couldn't we have given her
something and left her alone?

372
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:51,273
It just... hurts me so much.

373
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,994
I've never experienced
anything like this.

374
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,554
I wait to wake up,
like it's a bad dream.

375
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:13,149
Right, it's ten o'clock.
Let's get started.

376
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:16,158
Thank you all for coming
at such short notice.

377
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:20,550
I think we all agree that this is
a sensitive occasion,

378
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:23,194
which presents us
with tremendous challenges -

379
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:28,678
logistically, constitutionally,
practically,

380
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:32,588
diplomatically and procedurally.

381
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,711
Oh, Christ.

382
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:43,988
After 18 years of opposition,
I am proud to stand before you

383
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:46,111
as the new Prime Minister...

384
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,390
Labor Prime Minister.

385
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:51,796
I want to set an ambitious course
to modernize this country,

386
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:54,673
to breathe new life
into old institutions,

387
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:58,793
to make privilege
something for the many, not the few.

388
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:02,310
You think the royals are nutters?
You should meet their flunkies.

389
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:06,513
Two and a half hours to choose
between a hearse or a gun carriage.

390
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:10,838
You got raves in the press. This calls
you "The nation's mourner in chief."

391
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,350
This lot says you correctly judged
the country's mood.

392
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:17,040
- Hello?
- Even The Mail was impressed.

393
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:21,228
People's princess, mate. You owe me.

394
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,754
- Gordon for you.
- Tell him to hang on.

395
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,677
Alastair...

396
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:32,837
- Is it going to be a public funeral?
- Yeah. Saturday.

397
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:36,475
- It's a whopper. The Abbey, the works.
- Great.

398
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:40,036
- Has anyone told the Queen?
- I don't know.

399
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:44,551
No doubt some flunky will be
dispatched, groveling on all fours.

400
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,598
Do you think it's wise
for the boys to go stalking?

401
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:58,598
Anything
that gets them out is good.

402
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,711
Maybe they shouldn't take guns.

403
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:04,230
If a photographer saw them,
it might send the wrong signal.

404
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:09,354
If there is a photographer out there,
he could be the first kill of the day.

405
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:16,595
I see Mr. Fayed was buried last night.

406
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:20,076
At midnight. No cameras, no fuss.

407
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,191
Very dignified.

408
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:27,199
Why do they do that? Why do they bury
the bodies so soon after death?

409
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:30,118
Islamic tradition.

410
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,515
- Something to do with the heat.
- Mmm.

411
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,393
It stops the body decomposing.

412
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:37,431
Come in.

413
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,831
Good morning, ma'am. Ma'am.

414
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:44,520
Yes, Robin? What can we do for you?

415
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:49,191
Er... ma'am, there was a meeting
at the palace this morning.

416
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,436
About the funeral arrangements. Yes.

417
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:56,350
The Lord Chamberlain faxed these plans
for you to consider.

418
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,800
There is now general agreement, ma'am,

419
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:05,516
that a public funeral
would be more appropriate.

420
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,311
I see.

421
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:15,830
And what form will this funeral take?

422
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:18,758
At the moment, they're suggesting...

423
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:21,553
and, of course, these are early days,

424
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:24,114
basing it on Tay Bridge.

425
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:26,834
- Tay Bridge?
- What?

426
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,918
Tay Bridge is the code name
for my funeral.

427
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:32,110
Indeed, ma'am,

428
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:36,199
but it would be
for practical reasons only.

429
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,790
It's the only one
which has been rehearsed,

430
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:43,515
the only one
that could be put together in time.

431
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:47,076
But I supervised those plans myself.

432
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:50,715
Indeed, and the Lord Chamberlain
was at pains to stress

433
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:53,832
that the spirit of the occasion
will be quite different.

434
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:58,238
For example, the suggestion is
that instead of 400 soldiers,

435
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:05,277
400 representatives of the Princess's
charities march behind the coffin.

436
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:10,315
And, instead of foreign heads of state
and crowned heads of Europe,

437
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:15,594
the guests would include a sprinkling
of actors of stage and screen,

438
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:20,271
fashion designers
and other... celebrities.

439
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,958
Celebrities?

440
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,157
Oh.

441
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:31,434
Er... was there anything else?

442
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,431
No, ma'am.

443
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,591
Oh, yes, one other thing.

444
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:42,395
The police commissioner was keen
that you consider

445
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:45,193
the idea of a condolence book.

446
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:48,596
It would give the growing crowds
something to do,

447
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,711
make marshaling them easier.

448
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:53,673
Oh, yes. Yes, of course.

449
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:57,998
- Oh, and the flowers.
- What flowers?

450
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:00,634
The flowers outside Buckingham Palace.

451
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:03,433
They're blocking the main gate,

452
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:06,552
and making things difficult
for the changing of the guard.

453
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,830
Fine. Just move them away.

454
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:13,992
The Lord Chamberlain was wondering
whether we shouldn't leave the flowers

455
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:17,749
and send the guards
through the north gate.

456
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,677
Oh, yes. Yes, of course.

457
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,950
Yes, quite right.

458
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,116
Stephen Lamport on One.

459
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,800
- Who?
- Prince of Wales's private secretary.

460
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:37,480
- Balmoral.
- He says it's urgent.

461
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,509
It's all right.

462
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:46,030
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Prime Minister.

463
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:49,835
The Prince of Wales has asked me
to thank you for your kind words.

464
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,313
Not at all.

465
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:57,675
The Prince feels that you and he
are both modern men

466
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,109
of similar mind,

467
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:03,471
who could work well together
at this difficult time.

468
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:06,717
Er... well, please thank His Highness,

469
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:11,038
and assure him
he can count on my full support...

470
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:13,151
...at all times.

471
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:18,594
- Was that it?
- Er... yes.

472
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,517
Goodbye.

473
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,591
Bizarre.

474
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,991
- Why is Charles doing this?
- What?

475
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:36,193
Creeping up to me like this,
banging on about being modern.

476
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,709
He did it at the airport.

477
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:42,071
He knows that if the Queen
gets it wrong over Diana,

478
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:45,158
the royals will become
public enemy Number One.

479
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,953
- He's terrified of being shot.
- Who, Charles?

480
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:50,753
His people have asked
for extra protection.

481
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,633
He thinks if he's seen
to be on our side,

482
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,274
that will leave the Queen
in the firing line.

483
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,870
So it's OK for his mother
to take the bullet and not him?

484
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,991
What a family!

485
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:07,438
- Wait. Where are they?
- Up at Craggy Head.

486
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,551
- I'll come with you.
- In you go.

487
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,638
- Do you want me to drive?
- No. Certainly not.

488
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,793
- I thought you were getting a new one?
- What for? It's perfectly all right.

489
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:34,269
I was thinking
what Diana might have done

490
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,312
had it been me that died
in the tunnel in Paris.

491
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,558
She would have taken the boys
to Paris. I regret not doing that.

492
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:44,240
What, and expose them to the media?

493
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:47,557
That would have been dreadful.
They're better off here.

494
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,671
It's private. They're protected.

495
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:53,429
Whatever you thought of Diana,
she was a wonderful mother.

496
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:56,791
She adored those boys,
and never let them forget it.

497
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:01,072
Always warm, physical,
never afraid to show her feelings.

498
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:04,112
Especially if a photographer
was in sight.

499
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:07,038
She may have encouraged all that,
but still...

500
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:09,879
that was the extraordinary thing
about her -

501
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:15,028
her weaknesses and transgressions
only made the public love her more.

502
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:18,277
Yet ours only make them hate us.
Why do they hate us?

503
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,039
- Not us, dear.
- What?

504
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:26,396
Yesterday,
when we brought the coffin back,

505
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:29,717
there was a noise, a bang,
and I thought it was a gun.

506
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:32,912
I thought
someone had taken a shot at me.,

507
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,673
I think I'm going to walk back.

508
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,712
- I don't feel like stalking.
- Are you sure?

509
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,671
I'll take the dogs.

510
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,597
Walkies? Yes!

511
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,790
Who knows the way home? Come on.

512
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,513
'Do you think
you will ever be queen?'

513
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,111
No, I don't. No.

514
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:59,231
Why do you think that?

515
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:04,759
I'd like to be a queen
of people's hearts, in people's hearts,

516
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:09,158
'but I don't see myself
being queen of this country.

517
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,999
'I don't think many people
want me to be queen.

518
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:15,635
'By many people, I mean
the establishment I married into,

519
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:20,276
'because they've decided
that I'm a non-starter.'

520
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:25,517
Charles and I had a talk
in the car today.

521
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:30,836
He was good enough
to share his thoughts on motherhood.

522
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:34,669
- What did he say?
- How wonderful Diana was.

523
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,791
That's changing his tune.

524
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,911
He thought her natural.

525
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:44,795
'They see me as a threat
of some kind.'

526
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:47,718
Oh, for God's sake!

527
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:51,276
Maybe he's got a point.
Maybe we are partly to blame.

528
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,391
Oh, I can't watch this.

529
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:58,159
No, no. Wait. Please, no, leave it.

530
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:02,990
'I don't go by a rule book.
I lead from the heart, not the head,

531
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:05,315
'and it's got me into trouble
in my work.'

532
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:08,000
We encouraged the match.

533
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:10,111
We signed off on it, both of us.

534
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:13,118
You were very enthusiastic, remember?

535
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:15,231
She was a nice girl. Then.

536
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:20,074
And I was sure
he'd give the other one up,

537
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:23,158
or at least make sure
his wife toed the line.

538
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:26,750
- Isn't that what everyone does?
- Is it?

539
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:31,112
'Was Mrs. Parker Bowles a factor
in the breakdown of your marriage?'

540
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:35,552
'There were three of us in this
marriage, so it was a bit crowded.'

541
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:41,918
I can't bear it. If you're watching,
I'll sleep next door.

542
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:44,952
- Early start tomorrow.
- Any luck with your stag?

543
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:48,789
No. But close,
a couple of hundred yards at one point.

544
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,911
One of the boys even got a shot off.

545
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:55,235
We'll get him tomorrow.

546
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,990
See you in the morning.

547
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:02,394
Not to worry. Night-night.

548
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:08,392
'...and with her obsession
with the belief

549
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:12,399
'that Charles loved a woman he'd fallen
for years before, Camilla...'

550
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:32,109
The good news is the palace
agreed to video screens.

551
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:34,231
- And the bad news?
- Crash barriers.

552
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:37,591
- What about them?
- They expect over two million people.

553
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:39,836
There aren't enough barriers,

554
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:43,236
so we've gone cap in hand
to the French for theirs.

555
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:46,158
There's something else
I think you should see.

556
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:48,271
Can we run that piece again?

557
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,630
- Of course.
- You'll love this.

558
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:54,878
- '...find their behavior disgraceful.'
- 'What do you think?'

559
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:59,073
'I think it's disgusting that they've
not said a word relating to all this.'

560
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,589
- Look, I know all this.
- Wait for it.

561
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:05,838
'...not to have a flag up. I think
it's a disgrace on the royal family.'

562
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:09,589
'OK, the Queen's not in residence,
but where is the flag?

563
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:12,951
'Do you see what I'm saying
about the establishment?'

564
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:17,153
Don't tell me there isn't a flag
at half mast over Buckingham Palace.

565
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:22,149
'Dodi, when them two were together,
it was a fairy tale come true.'

566
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:26,068
Will someone please save these people
from themselves?

567
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:28,395
- Fine, I'll call Balmoral.
- Planet Zog?

568
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:30,875
I've really got nothing better to do.

569
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,511
Come on, dogs. Come on.

570
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:45,512
Those fire lighters all right?
A bit damp?

571
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:50,238
Oh, well,
I brought some stew just in case.

572
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:54,353
- It's lamb. We can have that cold.
- No, we'll be all right.

573
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:56,633
Stay.

574
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:03,436
Robin had a call from the Prime
Minister, who expressed his concern.

575
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:08,873
- About what?
- The flag above Buckingham Palace.

576
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,389
He thinks it should be flying
at half mast.

577
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:15,308
I hope Robin said there isn't a flag
above Buckingham Palace.

578
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:20,389
There's the Royal Standard, which flies
to denote the presence of the monarch.

579
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:24,638
Since you're here, the flagpole is bare,
just as it should be.

580
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:31,677
Isn't it possible that for some people,
the Royal Standard is just a flag,

581
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:35,395
and the flagpole being bare
sends out the wrong signal?

582
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:40,310
- No, that's not the point.
- The point is it's over 400 years old.

583
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:42,431
It's never been lowered for anyone.

584
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:47,429
Your grandfather didn't get
the flat at half mast when he died,

585
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:50,393
and if your mother died tomorrow,
she wouldn't either.

586
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:55,469
Yes, Granny, but in a situation
like this, one has to be flexible.

587
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:57,591
It is just a flag.

588
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:01,315
"What about the Union Jack?"
was Mr. Blair's next suggestion.

589
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:02,555
For heaven's sake!

590
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:05,797
Next, he'll suggest you
change your name to Hilda.

591
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:10,118
Who does the think he's talking to?
You're the sovereign.

592
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:14,870
You don't get dictated to. You conceded
the idea of a public funeral.

593
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,150
You've opened the parks.
That's enough.

594
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:20,158
Ssh. The boys.

595
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:23,955
You wait. In 48 hours,
this will all have calmed down.

596
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:57,835
In one sense, it's comforting.

597
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:00,872
Now, my parents can see
what it's been like for me,

598
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,833
being up against her popularity.

599
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:08,590
They're still making the mistake
of thinking the Diana they knew

600
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:12,599
will eventually be the one
seen by the public, but it won't.

601
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:18,113
The two Dianas, the public's and ours,
bear no relation to one another at all.

602
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:23,676
The flag of St. George,
it is at half mast over Highgrove?

603
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:26,917
- Yes, sir.
- Get a picture of that in the papers.

604
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:29,759
I'll get onto it,
call in a few favors.

605
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:33,919
What about a statement of gratitude
to the crowds?

606
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:37,396
Something heartfelt
from myself and the boys,

607
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:40,432
thanking people for the flowers
and so on.

608
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:41,754
Right.

609
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:46,192
'Di was wonderful, because
she stood up to the establishment.

610
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:50,916
'She said, "You're elitist people
we are paying to be better than us,

611
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:54,157
"'and you have to get out
among the people."

612
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:57,078
'We have a wonderful Prime Minister,
Tony Blair,

613
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:02,399
'a compassionate young man, who, after
18 years of establishment Tory rule

614
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:04,511
'is such a breath of fresh air,

615
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:07,393
'and I feel he will do something...'

616
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:09,875
- Is this the stirrings of...
- What?

617
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,595
I don't know.
Something more interesting.

618
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:16,792
Maybe people will see them
for what they are.

619
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:18,797
Which is?

620
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:23,152
A bunch of freeloading,
emotionally retarded nutters.

621
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:27,755
- That's just absurd.
- Why?

622
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:31,236
They live in a cocoon of wealth
and they don't pay tax.

623
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:35,797
- Yes, they do.
- The Queen costs us 40 million a year.

624
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:38,992
If you want a serious conversation
about the constitution.

625
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:41,111
We don't have one.

626
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:45,438
About ways in which we could phase out
hereditary privileges, then fine.

627
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:49,838
- If you're leaving, take the plates.
- Forget the 'off with their heads' bit.

628
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:52,952
- Why?
- It insults your intelligence.

629
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:55,913
'The Queen cannot be expected
to change.'

630
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:59,191
It's unimaginable,
this country being a republic.

631
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:01,754
- Certainly in her lifetime.
- Why?

632
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:05,793
Because no-one would wear it.
No-one wants it.

633
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:08,718
It's just... daft.

634
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:13,999
- It's not a mother thing, is it?
- What?

635
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:19,114
Well, if she were alive now,
your mother would be the same age.

636
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:22,190
You always say how stoical she was -

637
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:25,437
old-fashioned, uncomplaining,
lived through the war.

638
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:29,075
- Who does that sound like?
- I'm going to do the washing up.

639
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:48,349
That's the stalking party off.

640
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:52,439
Right, we'd better have a look
at those papers.

641
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:56,989
"Show us there's a heart in the house
of Windsor," says The Sun.

642
00:49:57,120 --> 00:50:00,954
"It's proof the royals
are not like us," The Mirror.

643
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:05,119
"Time to change the old guard
at Buckingham Palace," Express.

644
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:09,551
"One can't help wondering
whose advice they are taking,

645
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:12,069
"for it's clearly the wrong advice."

646
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:16,274
I'll try not to take that personally.

647
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:19,915
People have yearned for change
in this country.

648
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:22,474
The result is a quiet revolution

649
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:25,558
led by the real modernizers,
the British people.

650
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:28,558
Revolution? Who wrote this?

651
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:32,957
- Where does this come from?
- Where does it come from?

652
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:36,516
- You've won a huge majority.
- People want a change.

653
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,150
Why? What did you think it meant?

654
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:46,591
Hurry, dear. Your tea's getting cold.

655
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:48,711
- Is that it?
- Yes, ma'am.

656
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:52,833
Just the letter of condolence to the
widow of the ambassador to Brazil.

657
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:56,391
Thank you.

658
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:00,831
Tea.

659
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:06,313
Mr. Janvrin, the Prime
Minister wishes to speak to Her Majesty.

660
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:12,469
Ma'am,

661
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:15,751
apparently the Prime Minister
is on the phone.

662
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:18,474
Tell him to call back.

663
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:22,070
No, no. It's all right. I'll take it.

664
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:33,114
- Prime Minister.
- Good morning, Your Majesty.

665
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:37,836
Sorry to disturb, but I was wondering
if you'd seen today's papers?

666
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:41,634
We've managed to look
at one or two, yes.

667
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:46,914
'In which case, my next question
would be whether you felt

668
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:49,031
'some kind of response

669
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:51,833
'might be necessary?'

670
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:56,389
No. I believe a few over-eager editors

671
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:58,670
are doing their best
to sell newspapers.

672
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:01,189
It would be a mistake
to dance to their tune.

673
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:04,471
'Under normal circumstances,
I would agree,

674
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:10,038
'but...
Well, my advisors have been'

675
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:13,869
taking the temperature
among people on the streets,

676
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:18,278
and... well, the information I'm getting
is that the mood

677
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:21,472
'is quite delicate.'

678
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,309
So, what would you suggest,
Prime Minister?

679
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:30,194
- Some kind of a statement?
- No, ma'am.

680
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:33,710
I believe
the moment for statements has passed.

681
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:41,111
'I would suggest flying the flag
at half mast above Buckingham Palace...

682
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:47,633
...and coming down to London
at the earliest opportunity.

683
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:51,433
'It would be of great comfort
to your people.'

684
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:56,556
And would help them with their grief.

685
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:58,671
"Their grief"?

686
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:02,837
If you imagine
I'm going to come to London,

687
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:07,397
before I attend to my grandchildren,
who've just lost their mother...

688
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:09,556
then you're mistaken.

689
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:14,309
I doubt there is anyone who knows
the British people more than I do,

690
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:18,274
nor who has greater faith
in their wisdom and judgment.

691
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:24,635
And it is my belief that they will,
at any moment, reject this... this mood,

692
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:27,718
which is being stirred up by the press

693
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:30,593
in favor
of a period of restrained grief

694
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:32,711
and sober, private mourning.

695
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:37,512
That's the way we do things
in this country -

696
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:41,030
quietly, with dignity.

697
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:45,639
It's what the rest of the world
admires us for.

698
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:49,753
If that's your decision, ma'am,
the government will support it.

699
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:54,635
- Let's keep in touch.
- Yes, let's.

700
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:02,671
Bloody fool!

701
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:04,791
And now your tea's gone cold.

702
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:14,270
Tony, Robin Janvrin on One.
He was listening in.

703
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:20,594
Robin?

704
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:26,113
I understand how difficult
her behavior must seem to you,

705
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:28,435
but try and see it
from her perspective.

706
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:32,075
She's been brought up
to believe it's God's will.

707
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:34,191
'She is who she is.'

708
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:39,155
I think we should leave God out of it.
It's just not helpful.

709
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:42,272
She hasn't seen anything like this
since the abdication,

710
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:45,551
and I cannot emphasize
the effect that had.

711
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:49,559
Unexpectedly becoming king
as good as killed her father.

712
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:52,069
'I'm afraid she's in a state of shock.

713
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:55,670
'This public reaction
has completely thrown her.'

714
00:54:55,800 --> 00:55:01,272
All right, but first, we have to deal
with these terrible headlines.

715
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:06,239
- I'll do what I can with the press.
- I'm grateful, Prime Minister.

716
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:09,669
I can't promise anything.

717
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:12,189
It's not me they want to see.

718
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:37,749
Ask Alastair to come and see me.

719
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:44,429
Cancel what I'm doing tonight.

720
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:51,271
- Good morning.
- Your Majesty.

721
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:53,595
Thomas, where have they gone?

722
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:57,315
- Up to Abergannie Ridge, ma'am.
- All that way?

723
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:00,591
- Remind me, that's right at the fork?
- That's right, ma'am.

724
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:04,156
You follow the track for about a mile,
and you come to...

725
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:06,077
The river.

726
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:10,630
- One of the lads will drive you.
- No, I'll manage. Thank you.

727
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:14,831
Bugger it!

728
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:39,116
Oh, how stupid!

729
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:03,715
- 'Hello, Thomas.'
- Hello, ma'am.

730
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:07,310
I've done something foolish.
I've broken the prop shaft.

731
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:10,432
- Are you sure, ma'am.
- Yes, of course I'm sure.

732
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:13,791
It's the front one.
Lost the four-wheel drive.

733
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:16,514
Don't forget,
I was a mechanic during the war.

734
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:19,154
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

735
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:22,352
- We'll come out straight away.
- Thank you very much.

736
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:24,869
I'll wait by the car. You are kind.
Bye.

737
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:41,790
Oh, you're a beauty.

738
00:59:57,960 --> 01:00:00,474
Shoo! Shoo! Go on!

739
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:02,999
Go on.

740
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,797
Go on!

741
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:44,797
There are news crews outside waiting
for you to speak to the people.

742
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:47,593
- Yes.
- What's all that about?

743
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:51,713
I told the Queen's private secretary
I'd try to help with the press.

744
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:57,551
Why? Don't you think she deserves it,
sitting up there on her 40,000 acres?

745
01:00:57,680 --> 01:01:02,674
Yes, but allowing her to hang herself
might not be in our best interests either.

746
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:07,878
Besides, I think there's something ugly

747
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,560
about the way
everyone's started to bully her.

748
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:33,917
The first thing that you obviously
think about...

749
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:35,917
is the rest of your family, and I...

750
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:38,508
When's she coming to London, Mr. Blair?

751
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:41,598
- 'She's our figurehead.'
- 'She is.'

752
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:45,759
'She wanted me to pass on
to the people crowding around...'

753
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:49,634
'In a spare moment, the Prime
Minister went down Downing Street...'

754
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:53,273
- How are the boys?
- Not so good tonight.

755
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:55,789
A lot of slamming doors.

756
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:58,480
- I think they saw the papers.
- Oh, no!

757
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:01,876
I'll take them out
early again tomorrow morning.

758
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,150
Perhaps they'll take it out
on the stag.

759
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:09,840
'What do you think
of the royal family?'

760
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:11,598
'They've made a mistake.'

761
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:14,393
- Pardon?
- They've made a mistake.

762
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:18,195
- 'Why? What do you mean?'
- 'Well, they should've came.

763
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:23,394
'The family should have come down
to Buckingham Palace on Sunday,

764
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:25,511
'all of them.

765
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:27,631
'That girl's been left on her own.

766
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:30,194
'She's on her own
and the place is empty.'

767
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:32,515
Oh, please!

768
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:36,155
Sleeping in the streets
and pulling out their hair?

769
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:40,273
For someone they never knew?
And they think we're mad?

770
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:43,870
- Have you seen the funeral guest list?
- No.

771
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,991
I suggest you keep it that way.

772
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:49,908
A chorus line of soap stars
and homosexuals.

773
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:53,430
Apparently,
Elton John is going to be singing.

774
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:56,632
That'll be a first
for Westminster Abbey.

775
01:02:56,760 --> 01:03:01,390
Condolence books are being signed
in embassies all over the world,

776
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:05,149
and in London alone,
the number has reached 40.

777
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:08,272
It reminds me of one of those films -

778
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:11,995
a few of us in a fort,
hordes of Zulus outside.

779
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:18,078
So, it's vital you hold firm.
Stick to your guns.

780
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:21,875
You wait.
They will come to their senses soon.

781
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,991
They have to.

782
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:26,918
Come on, move over, Cabbage.

783
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:39,431
'It's six o'clock

784
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:42,028
'on Thursday 4th September.'

785
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:46,995
'As people start camping out on the route
of Princess Diana's funeral cortège,

786
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:51,113
'people are asking why the Queen
hasn't addressed her subjects?'

787
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:53,390
'This is what the newspapers
are saying,

788
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:57,149
"'Where is our Queen?
Where is her flag?"'

789
01:04:02,680 --> 01:04:06,673
The Express, "Show us you care."
A picture of a grumpy Queen.

790
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:10,110
The Mail,
"Let the flag fly at half mast,"

791
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:14,438
and inside, "The Queen should be here
to show her respects."

792
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:19,315
But the flip side is "Blair more
popular now than Churchill."

793
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:22,398
Did they pick up
on our statement of support?

794
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:25,159
Just the one.

795
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,560
Statements of support don't sell papers.

796
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:33,717
Right.

797
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:39,917
Ma'am! Ma'am!

798
01:04:40,040 --> 01:04:42,838
The Prime minister for you, ma'am.

799
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:46,479
I'm afraid he's rather insisting.

800
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:50,270
I'll take it in the kitchen.

801
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:58,950
Good morning. Sorry to disturb you.

802
01:04:59,080 --> 01:05:02,470
I'm expecting a phone call
to be put through. Out!

803
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:06,157
Oh, there it is.

804
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:11,191
Thank you, Peter.

805
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:19,515
- Good morning, Prime Minister.
- Good morning, ma'am.

806
01:05:19,640 --> 01:05:21,631
You've seen today's headlines?

807
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:23,637
Yes, I have.

808
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:25,751
Then I'm sure you'll agree

809
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:29,668
the situation has become
quite critical.

810
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:34,037
'Ma'am?'

811
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:37,277
A poll that's to be published
in tomorrow's papers

812
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:39,755
suggests that 70% of people

813
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:42,474
believe your actions
have damaged the monarchy...

814
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:50,349
...and that one in four are now in favor
of abolishing the monarchy altogether.

815
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:55,114
As your Prime Minister,

816
01:05:55,240 --> 01:05:58,994
I believe
it is my constitutional responsibility

817
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:01,350
to advise the following...

818
01:06:14,120 --> 01:06:16,111
Is Queen Elizabeth up yet?

819
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:25,235
Mummy?

820
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:29,478
One, fly the flag at half mast
above Buckingham Palace

821
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:31,955
and all other royal residences.

822
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:38,192
Two, leave Balmoral and fly to London
at the earliest opportunity.

823
01:06:39,640 --> 01:06:43,997
Three, pay our respects in person
at Diana's coffin.

824
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:52,075
And four, make a statement, via live
television, to my people and the world.

825
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:57,398
Swift prosecution of these matters
might, he felt,

826
01:06:57,520 --> 01:07:00,876
just might, avert disaster.

827
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:04,117
You will have to talk
to the Lord Chamberlain.

828
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:09,314
I have, and to Robert Fellowes.
They both agree with Mr. Blair.

829
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:11,431
- Oh, I see.
- Something's happened.

830
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:15,917
There's been a change,
some... shift in values.

831
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:22,836
When you no longer understand your
people, maybe it is time to hand over.

832
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:25,269
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

833
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:27,391
Remember the vow you took?

834
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:33,310
I declare that my whole life,
whether it be long or short,

835
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:35,954
shall be devoted to your service.

836
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:41,949
Your whole life. That is a commitment
to God as well as your people.

837
01:07:42,080 --> 01:07:44,435
What if my actions
are damaging the Crown?

838
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:49,839
Damaging it? You're the greatest asset
this institution has,

839
01:07:49,960 --> 01:07:52,633
one of the greatest it has ever had.

840
01:07:52,760 --> 01:07:58,118
No. The problem will come
when you leave,

841
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:00,959
but you mustn't think about that now,
not today.

842
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:02,911
Oh, Mummy.

843
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:08,114
You must show your strength,
reassert your authority.

844
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:12,359
You sit
on the most powerful throne in Europe,

845
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:16,837
head of an unbroken line that goes back
more than a thousand years.

846
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:21,078
Do you think any of your predecessors
would have dropped everything

847
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:26,035
and gone to London because
a bunch of hysterics carrying candles

848
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:28,276
needed help with their grief?

849
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:35,793
As for that silly Mr. Blair,
with his Cheshire cat grin...

850
01:08:50,440 --> 01:08:53,079
Mr. Janvrin on the phone for you, sir.

851
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:56,231
Yes?

852
01:08:56,360 --> 01:08:58,157
What?

853
01:08:58,280 --> 01:09:00,157
I can't hear!

854
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:03,469
Well, that's madness!

855
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:07,718
The whole thing. Bloody madness!

856
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:13,715
I've just been told

857
01:09:13,840 --> 01:09:19,039
you've decided we're to follow
the Prime Minister's advice.

858
01:09:19,160 --> 01:09:21,390
I just want to say I...

859
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:24,391
admire...

860
01:09:26,440 --> 01:09:28,670
I think it's the right decision.

861
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:32,319
Let's hope we haven't left it too late.

862
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:17,353
'These are historic shots
of the Windsors.

863
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:19,471
'The Queen has had a change of heart.

864
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:21,591
'She's clearly responding to the need

865
01:10:21,720 --> 01:10:24,837
'to feel that the royal family is
somehow engaged.

866
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:28,236
'These flowers have been brought
to Balmoral

867
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:32,876
'so she can see some token
of what's been expressed in London.'

868
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:36,390
Fish fingers. Do you want any?
- I'll be right there.

869
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:43,236
Thank God for that!

870
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:45,351
I'm afraid they're a bit burnt.

871
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:07,274
'From CNN International,
this is World News

872
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:09,709
'with Ralitsa Vassileva
from CNN Center.'

873
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:13,674
Queen Elizabeth will deliver
a televised address, Friday.

874
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:16,792
The royal family has been accused
of showing little grief

875
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:18,717
over the Princess's death.

876
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:42,876
- Where are the boys? Have they left?
- Yes.

877
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,992
They left for London
after breakfast with Charles.

878
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:48,797
It's not right, you know.

879
01:11:48,920 --> 01:11:51,912
No, but further discussion
is no longer helpful either.

880
01:11:52,040 --> 01:11:53,632
Oh, well.

881
01:11:54,920 --> 01:11:58,515
It gives the gillies time
to find another stag for the boys,

882
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:00,437
now theirs has been shot.

883
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:02,915
- What?
- Haven't you heard?

884
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:05,554
He wandered over
to a neighboring estate,

885
01:12:05,680 --> 01:12:08,990
where one of the commercial guests
got him.

886
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:10,917
Oh.

887
01:12:12,040 --> 01:12:13,837
Really?

888
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,070
Which estate?

889
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:38,192
Here's your box. There's some
policy unit stuff that's important.

890
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:40,959
- Have you seen the papers?
- I thought I'd skip them.

891
01:12:41,080 --> 01:12:43,355
- Of course I've seen them.
- Not bad, eh?

892
01:12:43,480 --> 01:12:47,951
"Your Majesty, come to London."
"Who says so?" "Tony Blair."

893
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:52,400
Mr. Father of the Nation.

894
01:13:08,040 --> 01:13:10,600
Ma'am? Good morning, ma'am.

895
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:13,757
- Good morning.
- Is it his lordship you came to see?

896
01:13:13,880 --> 01:13:18,510
No, please don't disturb him. I came on
another matter. I hope you don't mind.

897
01:13:40,040 --> 01:13:42,031
There he is.

898
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:45,191
He's a beauty, isn't he?

899
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:48,311
An imperial, ma'am.

900
01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:52,151
Fourteen-pointer.

901
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:03,434
- He was wounded.
- Yes.

902
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:07,599
We got our guests in very close,
had him lined up perfect...

903
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:10,671
...and still...

904
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:13,439
An investment banker, ma'am,
from London.

905
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:18,189
I'm afraid the stalkers had to follow
him for miles to finish him off.

906
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:23,555
Let's hope he didn't suffer too much.

907
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:35,395
Pass my congratulations to your guest.

908
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:37,511
I will, ma'am.

909
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:46,519
- God bless you, ma'am.
- Thank you.

910
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:20,920
- Ma'am...
- Yes, Robin?

911
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:24,077
I've done a draft
of your television address.

912
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:26,760
Thank you.

913
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:32,589
Was there anything else?

914
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:34,711
No, ma'am.

915
01:15:34,840 --> 01:15:36,831
Landing in 15 minutes.

916
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:50,035
I've got the Queen's speech.

917
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,992
- Shall I give Tony a copy?
- Let me look at it first.

918
01:15:54,120 --> 01:15:56,111
He's next door.

919
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:04,070
'...and the anger,
as somebody said earlier,

920
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:08,910
'perhaps was that people grieving
need to target their anger at somebody,

921
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:12,191
'and royal protocol
might have got in the way,

922
01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:15,835
'but royal protocol
is being swept aside en masse today.'

923
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:26,592
Come back, Diana!

924
01:16:27,240 --> 01:16:29,037
'...very serious,

925
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:32,471
'Her Majesty and the Duke.

'Normally, it is a happy occasion
when they arrive here,

927
01:16:36,200 --> 01:16:38,668
'and normally,
when they're out the front,

928
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:42,395
'on days like Trooping the Color,
VE Day or VJ Day.

929
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:44,511
'This is a tragic occasion.'

930
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:48,428
'The Queen is getting out
to talk to people.'

931
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:51,518
'It's very unusual.
This is unprecedented.

932
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:55,838
'I think, perhaps the last time
the Queen was among her people

933
01:16:55,960 --> 01:16:59,873
'outside the palace was the day
the war in Europe ended.'

934
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:03,993
'It's really as if the public
and the royal family, the monarchy,

935
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:09,069
'have had a bit of a quarrel and now
it's being healed in some measure.'

936
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:14,911
'Like a family spat, not unlike
the spats they acknowledged with Diana.

937
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:20,433
'Jenny is quite right to say that whatever
the professional ups and downs

938
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:22,710
'between the Queen and the Princess...'

939
01:17:22,840 --> 01:17:25,149
They sent a copy of the Queen's
speech.

940
01:17:26,160 --> 01:17:29,152
You might want
to scrape the frost off it first.

941
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:32,272
'I think the queen was generous
in recognizing

942
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:36,279
'that her oldest son wasn't
the easiest chap to be married to.'

943
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:40,188
I sent some suggestions to make it
seem like it came from a human.

944
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:42,709
Yeah, all right, Alastair.

945
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:46,638
At least the old bat agreed
to visit Diana's coffin.

946
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:49,832
When you get it wrong,
you really get it wrong.

947
01:17:49,960 --> 01:17:54,397
That woman has given her whole life
in service to her people,

948
01:17:54,520 --> 01:17:58,877
50 years doing a job she never wanted,
a job she watched kill her father.

949
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:03,949
She's executed it with honor, dignity,
and without a single blemish,

950
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:06,230
and now,
we're all baying for her blood!

951
01:18:06,360 --> 01:18:08,749
She's leading the world in mourning

952
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:11,440
for someone who threw all she offered
in her face,

953
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:13,994
and who, for years, seemed committed

954
01:18:14,120 --> 01:18:17,396
to destroying
everything she holds most dear!

955
01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:22,278
Hello. Would you like me
to place those for you?

956
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:25,233
- No.
- Oh.

957
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:28,868
These are for you.

958
01:19:30,280 --> 01:19:32,271
For me?

959
01:19:35,240 --> 01:19:37,754
Thank you.

960
01:19:37,880 --> 01:19:39,871
Thank you very much.

961
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:10,916
Ma'am, there's been a last-minute
addition from Downing Street.

962
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:15,192
They're suggesting adding,
"and as a grandmother" here.

963
01:20:15,320 --> 01:20:17,311
Right.

964
01:20:21,440 --> 01:20:25,752
"So, what I say to you now,
as your Queen, and as a grandmother,

965
01:20:25,880 --> 01:20:27,950
"I say from my heart."

966
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:30,435
Do you think you can say it?

967
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:34,235
- Do I have a choice?
- They're ready for you, Your Majesty.

968
01:20:36,160 --> 01:20:39,277
- Just to confirm, this is live.
- Fine.

969
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:42,472
You'll be at the front of the six o'clock
news on all channels.

970
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:44,397
Yes.

971
01:21:22,240 --> 01:21:24,231
Thank you.

972
01:21:25,240 --> 01:21:27,913
- OK, nice and quiet.
- Ten seconds.

973
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:34,512
'We cross, now, live,
to Buckingham Palace

974
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:37,837
'for the Queen's tribute
to Princess Diana.'

975
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:45,830
Since last Sunday's dreadful news,

976
01:21:45,960 --> 01:21:49,032
we have seen, throughout Britain
and around the world,

977
01:21:49,160 --> 01:21:53,517
an overwhelming expression of sadness
at Diana's death.

978
01:21:53,640 --> 01:21:57,838
We have all been trying,
in our different ways, to cope.

979
01:21:57,960 --> 01:22:01,350
It is not easy
to express a sense of loss,

980
01:22:01,480 --> 01:22:05,439
'since the initial shock
is often succeeded by other feelings,

981
01:22:05,560 --> 01:22:11,590
'disbelief, incomprehension, anger
and concern for those who remain.

982
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:16,555
'We have all felt those emotions
in these last few days,'

983
01:22:16,680 --> 01:22:21,879
so what I say to you now,
as your Queen, and as a grandmother,

984
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,355
I say from my heart.

985
01:22:24,480 --> 01:22:29,076
Heart? What heart?
She doesn't mean a word of this.

986
01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:32,158
That's not the point.
What she's doing is extraordinary.

987
01:22:32,280 --> 01:22:34,589
'In good times and bad...'

988
01:22:34,720 --> 01:22:37,314
- That's how to survive.
- Listen to you.

989
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:40,432
A week ago,
you were the great modernizer,

990
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:43,552
making speeches
about the people's princess.

991
01:22:43,680 --> 01:22:46,831
- Now you've gone weak at the knees.
- Ssh.

992
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:49,554
'...and for her devotion
to her two boys.'

993
01:22:49,680 --> 01:22:52,319
I don't know why I'm so surprised.

994
01:22:52,440 --> 01:22:56,672
At the end of the day, all Labor prime
ministers go gaga for the Queen.

995
01:22:56,800 --> 01:22:58,472
What?

996
01:22:58,600 --> 01:23:03,196
'Millions who never met her,
but felt they knew her, will remember her.

997
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:08,913
'I, for one, believe there are lessons
to be drawn from her life,

998
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:12,828
'and from the extraordinary
and moving reaction to her death.

999
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:18,108
'I share in your determination
to cherish her memory.'

1000
01:23:18,240 --> 01:23:22,153
I hope that, tomorrow, we can all,
wherever we are,

1001
01:23:22,280 --> 01:23:25,590
join in expressing our grief
at Diana's loss

1002
01:23:25,720 --> 01:23:28,996
and gratitude
for her all-too-short life.

1003
01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:31,839
May those who died rest in peace,

1004
01:23:31,960 --> 01:23:34,952
and may we, each and every one of us,

1005
01:23:35,080 --> 01:23:40,791
thank God for someone
who made many, many people happy.

1006
01:23:47,240 --> 01:23:49,913
'Diana's coffin, now on the move

1007
01:23:50,040 --> 01:23:52,679
'the short distance
from St. James's Palace,

1008
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:57,794
'to her home at Kensington Palace
before her burial tomorrow.

1009
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:01,758
'It's incredible. Less than a week.

1010
01:24:01,880 --> 01:24:04,599
'Who could have imagined
such scenes?'

1011
01:25:15,560 --> 01:25:20,236
Diana was the very essence
of compassion, of duty,

1012
01:25:20,360 --> 01:25:22,351
of style, of beauty,

1013
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:27,429
a very British girl,
who transcended nationality,

1014
01:25:27,560 --> 01:25:31,314
someone with a natural nobility,
who was classless,

1015
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:35,149
and who proved
that she needed no royal title

1016
01:25:35,280 --> 01:25:38,477
to continue to generate
her brand of magic.

1017
01:25:42,600 --> 01:25:45,114
I would like to end by thanking God

1018
01:25:45,240 --> 01:25:48,357
for the mercies he's shown us
at this dreadful time,

1019
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:51,517
for taking Diana
at her most beautiful and radiant,

1020
01:25:51,640 --> 01:25:53,835
and when she had joy in her life.

1021
01:25:53,960 --> 01:25:57,396
Above all,
we give thanks for the life of a woman

1022
01:25:57,520 --> 01:26:00,273
I'm so proud
to be able to call my sister,

1023
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:02,994
the unique, the complex,

1024
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:06,032
the extraordinary
and irreplaceable Diana,

1025
01:26:06,160 --> 01:26:09,152
whose beauty,
both internal and external,

1026
01:26:09,280 --> 01:26:12,113
will never be extinguished
from our minds.

1027
01:27:04,840 --> 01:27:07,149
So, off to see your girlfriend?

1028
01:27:07,280 --> 01:27:09,271
Now, now...

1029
01:27:11,040 --> 01:27:13,952
I hope she shows you
some respect this time.

1030
01:27:14,080 --> 01:27:17,436
It's quite a debt of gratitude
she owes you,

1031
01:27:17,560 --> 01:27:20,120
Mr. Savior of the Monarchy.

1032
01:27:20,240 --> 01:27:22,595
I doubt she'll see it that way.

1033
01:27:27,120 --> 01:27:29,111
- Robin.
- Prime Minister.

1034
01:27:29,240 --> 01:27:31,629
Tony, please.

1035
01:27:40,440 --> 01:27:42,829
The Prime Minister, Your Majesty.

1036
01:27:50,640 --> 01:27:52,631
Do sit down.

1037
01:27:53,640 --> 01:27:55,631
Thank you.

1038
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:08,070
It's good to see you again,

1039
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:11,875
after what's been... quite a summer.

1040
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:15,470
I'm referring to your visit
to India and Pakistan...

1041
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:19,559
where your comments on ending historic
disagreements went down well.

1042
01:28:21,480 --> 01:28:24,677
At the Commonwealth
Heads of Government Meeting,

1043
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:26,870
I spoke to the prime minister of Malawi.

1044
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:30,993
He said how much he appreciated
your tough stance on Nigeria.

1045
01:28:31,120 --> 01:28:33,680
I meant to tell you at the time,
but, er...

1046
01:28:34,680 --> 01:28:37,194
...you were being monopolized rather.

1047
01:28:39,320 --> 01:28:42,198
I imagine those occasions
must be quite difficult,

1048
01:28:42,320 --> 01:28:47,314
24 heads of government, each
clamoring for a private audience.

1049
01:28:51,400 --> 01:28:55,552
Also, we haven't had a chance to speak
since... that week.

1050
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:02,190
- I wanted to offer my apologies.
- Whatever for?

1051
01:29:02,320 --> 01:29:06,108
In case you felt manhandled
or managed in any way.

1052
01:29:06,240 --> 01:29:08,879
No, not at all.

1053
01:29:13,720 --> 01:29:17,633
I don't think I shall ever understand
what happened this summer.

1054
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:21,275
Well, the circumstances
were exceptional, ma'am...

1055
01:29:22,280 --> 01:29:27,593
...and in the end, you showed
great strength, courage and humility.

1056
01:29:27,720 --> 01:29:31,554
- You mistake humility for humiliation.
- That's not true.

1057
01:29:31,680 --> 01:29:35,753
You didn't read the cards
on the flowers outside the palace.

1058
01:29:35,880 --> 01:29:39,031
I think history will show
it was a good week for you.

1059
01:29:39,160 --> 01:29:41,628
And an even better one for you,
Mr. Blair.

1060
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:44,593
But there are 52 weeks
in the year, ma'am,

1061
01:29:44,720 --> 01:29:49,475
and two and a half thousand
in the time since you've been Queen.

1062
01:29:52,120 --> 01:29:56,159
When people assess your legacy,
they won't remember those days.

1063
01:29:56,280 --> 01:29:58,555
Oh, really?

1064
01:29:58,680 --> 01:30:03,117
You don't think that what affection
people once had for...

1065
01:30:03,240 --> 01:30:07,279
for this institution
has been diminished?

1066
01:30:07,400 --> 01:30:12,110
No. Not at all.
You're more respected now than ever.

1067
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:16,119
I gather some of your advisors
were less fulsome in their support.

1068
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:19,591
One or two,

1069
01:30:19,720 --> 01:30:23,554
but, as a leader, I could never add
my voice to that chorus.

1070
01:30:23,680 --> 01:30:27,355
You saw the headlines and thought,
"One day, it might be me."

1071
01:30:29,600 --> 01:30:34,151
And it will, Mr. Blair, quite suddenly,
and without warning.

1072
01:30:36,120 --> 01:30:39,749
So, shall we get on
with the business in hand?

1073
01:30:40,760 --> 01:30:43,479
Oh, look...

1074
01:30:43,600 --> 01:30:48,037
Oh, I do love this time of day.
Shall we walk while there's light?

1075
01:30:48,160 --> 01:30:51,516
The clocks go back next week.
It'll be dark before five.

1076
01:30:51,640 --> 01:30:54,029
- I do hope you're a walker.
- I am.

1077
01:30:54,160 --> 01:30:57,470
Good. I think meetings have
a greater chance of success

1078
01:30:57,600 --> 01:31:00,637
if the Prime Minister is a walker.

1079
01:31:00,760 --> 01:31:04,992
It's how I think best, on my feet.
I've never been one for sitting around.

1080
01:31:05,120 --> 01:31:08,112
A good walk in fresh air
sorts everything out.

1081
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:16,396
One in four, you said,
wanted to get rid of me?

1082
01:31:16,520 --> 01:31:22,038
For about half an hour,
but then you came down to London,

1083
01:31:22,160 --> 01:31:24,151
and all that went away.

1084
01:31:25,240 --> 01:31:28,038
I've never been hated like that before.

1085
01:31:28,160 --> 01:31:29,991
It must have been difficult.

1086
01:31:30,120 --> 01:31:33,635
Yes. Very.

1087
01:31:37,920 --> 01:31:41,799
Nowadays, people want glamour
and tears, the grand performance.

1088
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:45,310
I'm not very good at that.
I never have been.

1089
01:31:45,440 --> 01:31:48,955
I prefer to keep my feelings to myself,

1090
01:31:49,080 --> 01:31:52,755
and, foolishly, I believed that was
what people wanted from their Queen -

1091
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:55,713
not to make a fuss,
nor wear one's heart on one's sleeve.

1092
01:31:55,840 --> 01:31:58,434
Duty first, self second.

1093
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:02,031
That's how I was brought up.

1094
01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:04,871
That's all I've ever known.

1095
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,958
You were so young
when you became Queen.

1096
01:32:14,120 --> 01:32:15,917
Yes.

1097
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:18,991
Yes, a girl.

1098
01:32:24,360 --> 01:32:27,511
But I can see
that the world has changed,

1099
01:32:27,640 --> 01:32:31,030
and one must... modernize.

1100
01:32:32,760 --> 01:32:36,230
Well, perhaps that's where I can help.

1101
01:32:36,360 --> 01:32:39,033
Don't get ahead of yourself,
Prime Minister.

1102
01:32:39,160 --> 01:32:42,550
I'm the one
supposed to be advising you.

1103
01:32:45,880 --> 01:32:47,472
Come, dogs!

1104
01:32:55,400 --> 01:32:59,154
Tell me, Mr. Blair, what might we expect
from our first parliament?

1105
01:32:59,280 --> 01:33:04,070
Er... well, ma'am,
top of the list is education.

1106
01:33:04,200 --> 01:33:07,590
We want to reduce classroom sizes.

1107
01:33:07,720 --> 01:33:09,711
Yes.

1108
01:33:09,840 --> 01:33:12,832
And create a lower teacher-pupil ratio.

1109
01:38:37,840 --> 01:38:41,833
