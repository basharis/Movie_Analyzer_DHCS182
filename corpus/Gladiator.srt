1
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:20,659
- Sir.
- General.

2
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:23,036
- General.
- Sir.

3
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,289
General.

4
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,416
-Sir.
- General.

5
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:29,084
General.

6
00:03:29,168 --> 00:03:31,753
- Sir.

7
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:49,188
Lean and hungry.

8
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:54,610
- Still nothing?
- Not a sign.

9
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:57,571
- How long has he been gone?
- Nearly two hours.

10
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:03,577
- Will they fight, sir?
- We shall know soon enough.

11
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,288
Soldier, I ordered you
to move those catapults forward.

12
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:09,875
- They're out of range.
- Range is good.

13
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:13,420
- The danger to the cavalry-
- It is acceptable. Agreed?

14
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:24,765
They say no.

15
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:36,318
- Steady! Steady!

16
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:52,543
People should know
when they're conquered.

17
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:07,558
Would you, Quintus?
Would l?

18
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:24,908
Strength and honor.

19
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:27,536
- Strength and honor.
- Strength and honor.

20
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:35,669
At my signal,
unleash hell.

21
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:01,778
Load the catapults.

22
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:04,281
Infantry form up
for advance.

23
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,742
- Archers ready.
- Archers!

24
00:06:06,825 --> 00:06:08,619
- Knock!
- Knock!

25
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:35,604
- Patres!
- Maximus!

26
00:06:37,231 --> 00:06:40,901
Three weeks from now,
I will be harvesting my crops.

27
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:45,447
Imagine where you will be,
and it will be so.

28
00:06:46,532 --> 00:06:49,743
Hold the line!
Stay with me!

29
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:52,538
If you find yourself alone,

30
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:55,249
riding in green fields
with the sun on your face,

31
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:59,753
do not be troubled.

32
00:06:59,795 --> 00:07:03,465
For you are in Elysium,
and you're already dead!

33
00:07:05,801 --> 00:07:07,469
Brothers,

34
00:07:08,637 --> 00:07:11,515
what we do in life...

35
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:13,559
echoes in eternity.

36
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:22,818
- Pull!

37
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:33,537
Pull! Pull!

38
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,502
Catapults ready, sir!

39
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:53,724
Archers, ignite!

40
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:56,393
- Ignite!
- Ignite!

41
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:04,860
Archers, draw!

42
00:08:07,613 --> 00:08:09,573
Loose!

43
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:13,744
Loose!

44
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:22,961
Aah!

45
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:25,130
Aah!

46
00:08:30,636 --> 00:08:33,096
- Aah!
- Aah!

47
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:41,813
All right, men, ready!

48
00:08:46,318 --> 00:08:48,737
Hold the line!

49
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:57,037
Draw! Loose!

50
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,289
Loose! Loose!

51
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:01,291
Reload!

52
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:07,840
Hold the line!

53
00:09:07,923 --> 00:09:10,217
Draw! Loose!

54
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:15,597
Stay with me!

55
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:22,229
Stay with me!

56
00:09:50,007 --> 00:09:52,926
Roma Victor!

57
00:10:09,568 --> 00:10:11,403
Aah!

58
00:10:20,871 --> 00:10:23,290
Aah!

59
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,264
Aah!

60
00:10:44,728 --> 00:10:47,064
Aah!

61
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:51,276
Aah!

62
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:10,254
Aah!

63
00:11:15,384 --> 00:11:18,345
Aah!

64
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:46,957
Aah!

65
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,081
Roma Victor!

66
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:12,751
Do you think
he's really dying?

67
00:13:13,794 --> 00:13:15,796
He's been dying
for ten years.

68
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:19,091
If he weren't really dying,
he wouldn't have sent for us.

69
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,344
Maybe he just
misses us.

70
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:25,180
And the senators?
He wouldn't have summoned them if-

71
00:13:25,264 --> 00:13:27,182
Peace, Commodus.

72
00:13:27,266 --> 00:13:30,853
After two weeks on the road, your
incessant scheming is hurting my head.

73
00:13:37,192 --> 00:13:39,194
He's made
his decision.

74
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:41,697
He's going to announce it.

75
00:13:44,867 --> 00:13:46,785
He will name me.

76
00:13:49,538 --> 00:13:52,374
The first thing I shall do...

77
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:54,376
when-

78
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:59,840
is honor him with games
worthy of His Majesty.

79
00:13:59,882 --> 00:14:04,344
For now, the first thing
I shall do is have a bath.

80
00:14:04,428 --> 00:14:07,806
- Your Highness?

81
00:14:09,975 --> 00:14:13,145
We seem to be almost there, sir.

82
00:14:18,942 --> 00:14:21,862
- Sire.
- Where's the Emperor?

83
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:25,073
He's at the front, sire.
They've been gone for 1 9 days.

84
00:14:25,115 --> 00:14:27,910
The wounded are
still coming in.

85
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:29,912
My horse.

86
00:14:29,953 --> 00:14:31,914
My lord.

87
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:37,002
Kiss?

88
00:15:11,328 --> 00:15:13,247
You have proved
your valor...

89
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:16,458
yet again, Maximus.

90
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:20,504
Let us hope
for the last time.

91
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:23,382
There's no one
left to fight, sire.

92
00:15:23,465 --> 00:15:25,926
Ah. There is always
someone left to fight.

93
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:28,929
How can I reward
Rome's greatest general?

94
00:15:34,351 --> 00:15:36,937
Let me go home.

95
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:39,690
Ah. Home.

96
00:15:46,196 --> 00:15:48,115
Whoa! Whoa!

97
00:15:57,875 --> 00:16:00,002
They honor you, Caesar.

98
00:16:00,085 --> 00:16:03,005
It's for you, Maximus.
They honor you.

99
00:16:25,611 --> 00:16:28,572
Have I missed it?
Have I missed the battle?

100
00:16:28,614 --> 00:16:31,325
You have
missed the war.

101
00:16:31,408 --> 00:16:33,744
Father, congratulations.

102
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:36,747
I shall sacrifice a hundred bulls
to honor your triumph.

103
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:38,832
Save the bulls.

104
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:41,084
Honor Maximus.
He won the battle.

105
00:16:41,168 --> 00:16:44,171
- General.
- Highness.

106
00:16:44,254 --> 00:16:48,550
Rome salutes you,
and I embrace you as a brother.

107
00:16:48,592 --> 00:16:50,886
It has been too long,
my old friend.

108
00:16:50,928 --> 00:16:53,055
- Highness.
- Here, Father.

109
00:16:53,096 --> 00:16:55,432
Take my arm.

110
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,520
I think it is time
for me to leave.

111
00:17:14,284 --> 00:17:17,704
So much for
the glory of Rome.

112
00:17:38,517 --> 00:17:40,435
Magnificent battle.

113
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:05,878
- General.
- Still alive?

114
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:08,964
-Still alive.
- The gods must have a sense of humor.

115
00:18:09,047 --> 00:18:11,717
- The gods must love you.
- Valerius.

116
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,344
Back to barracks, General?
Or to Rome?

117
00:18:14,428 --> 00:18:17,514
Home. My wife,
the son, the harvest.

118
00:18:17,598 --> 00:18:21,727
Maximus the farmer.
I still have difficulty imagining that.

119
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:25,439
You know, dirt cleans off a lot
easier than blood, Quintus.

120
00:18:25,522 --> 00:18:27,691
- Here he is.
- Highness.

121
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:29,651
Senator Gaius,
Senator Falco.

122
00:18:29,735 --> 00:18:33,155
Beware of Gaius. He'll pour a honeyed
potion in your ear...

123
00:18:33,197 --> 00:18:35,991
and you'll wake up one day,
and all you'll say is,
" Republic, republic, republic."

124
00:18:36,074 --> 00:18:39,161
Well, why not?
Rome was founded as a republic.

125
00:18:39,244 --> 00:18:42,080
Yes, and in a republic
the senate has the power.

126
00:18:42,164 --> 00:18:44,583
But Senator Gaius isn't
influenced by that, of course.

127
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:47,336
Where do you stand, General?
Emperor or senate?

128
00:18:47,377 --> 00:18:52,674
The soldier has the advantage
of being able to look
his enemy in the eye, Senator.

129
00:18:52,716 --> 00:18:56,762
Well, with an army behind you,
you could be extremely political.

130
00:18:56,845 --> 00:18:59,723
I warned you.
Now I shall save you. Senators.

131
00:19:08,899 --> 00:19:11,860
Maximus.

132
00:19:11,902 --> 00:19:14,780
I'm going to need
good men like you.

133
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:19,368
How may I be of service,
Highness?

134
00:19:19,451 --> 00:19:22,329
You're a man who knows
what it is to command.

135
00:19:22,412 --> 00:19:25,874
You give your orders, the orders
are obeyed and the battle is won.

136
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:30,587
But these senators scheme
and squabble and flatter and deceive.

137
00:19:30,629 --> 00:19:34,132
Maximus, we must save Rome
from the politicians, my friend.

138
00:19:34,216 --> 00:19:37,761
Can I count on you...
when the time comes?

139
00:19:43,475 --> 00:19:46,812
Highness, when your father releases me,
I intend to return home.

140
00:19:46,895 --> 00:19:51,024
Home?
Well, no one's earned it more.

141
00:19:51,108 --> 00:19:55,112
Don't get too comfortable.
I may call on you before long.

142
00:19:56,864 --> 00:19:59,992
Lucilla's here.
Did you know?

143
00:20:00,075 --> 00:20:02,953
She's not forgotten you.

144
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:05,289
And now you're
the great man.

145
00:20:17,467 --> 00:20:20,345
If only you
had been born a man.

146
00:20:21,388 --> 00:20:23,390
What a caesar
you would have made.

147
00:20:25,392 --> 00:20:27,352
Father.

148
00:20:32,774 --> 00:20:34,735
You would have
been strong.

149
00:20:34,818 --> 00:20:37,905
I wonder,
would you have been just?

150
00:20:37,988 --> 00:20:40,616
I would have been
what you taught me to be.

151
00:20:40,699 --> 00:20:43,118
Oh.

152
00:20:43,202 --> 00:20:45,120
How was your journey?

153
00:20:45,204 --> 00:20:49,458
Long. Uncomfortable.
Why have I come?

154
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,044
I need your help.
With your brother.

155
00:20:52,127 --> 00:20:54,254
Of course.

156
00:20:54,296 --> 00:20:56,256
He loves you.
He always has.

157
00:20:57,466 --> 00:21:00,427
And...

158
00:21:00,469 --> 00:21:03,931
he will need you now
more than ever.

159
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:10,562
Enough of politics.

160
00:21:10,646 --> 00:21:14,983
Let us pretend that you
are a loving daughter...

161
00:21:15,025 --> 00:21:17,069
and I am a good father.

162
00:21:22,366 --> 00:21:25,911
This is a pleasant fiction,
isn't it?

163
00:21:38,131 --> 00:21:40,175
Good morning.

164
00:21:52,437 --> 00:21:55,399
I need three more horses.

165
00:22:05,075 --> 00:22:07,411
Two! Three!

166
00:22:07,452 --> 00:22:09,454
Four!

167
00:22:09,496 --> 00:22:12,166
One! Two!

168
00:22:27,848 --> 00:22:30,726
You sent for me, Caesar?

169
00:22:33,103 --> 00:22:35,022
Caesar?

170
00:22:35,105 --> 00:22:38,525
Tell me again, Maximus.

171
00:22:38,609 --> 00:22:41,528
Why are we here?

172
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:44,531
For the glory
of the Empire, sire.

173
00:22:44,573 --> 00:22:46,533
Ah, yes.

174
00:22:47,618 --> 00:22:50,037
Ah, yes, I remember.

175
00:22:52,414 --> 00:22:55,042
Do you see that map,
Maximus?

176
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:59,213
That is the world
which I created.

177
00:22:59,254 --> 00:23:01,590
For25years...

178
00:23:01,673 --> 00:23:06,470
I have conquered, spilt blood,
expanded the Empire.

179
00:23:06,553 --> 00:23:10,516
Since I became caesar,
I've known four years without war.

180
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:12,893
Four years of peace in 20.

181
00:23:12,935 --> 00:23:15,729
And for what?

182
00:23:22,277 --> 00:23:25,822
I brought the sword.
Nothing more.

183
00:23:25,906 --> 00:23:28,575
Caesar, your life-

184
00:23:28,659 --> 00:23:31,745
Please.
Please don't call me that.

185
00:23:31,829 --> 00:23:34,581
Come. Please.

186
00:23:34,665 --> 00:23:36,834
Come sit.

187
00:23:36,917 --> 00:23:40,128
Let us talk together now-

188
00:23:40,212 --> 00:23:42,506
very simply-as men.

189
00:23:44,174 --> 00:23:47,845
Maximus... talk.

190
00:23:51,557 --> 00:23:54,351
Five thousand of my men
are out there in the freezing mud.

191
00:23:54,434 --> 00:23:56,854
Three thousand of them
are bloodied and cleaved.

192
00:23:56,937 --> 00:23:59,022
Two thousand will never
leave this place.

193
00:23:59,106 --> 00:24:01,567
I will not believe that they
fought and died for nothing.

194
00:24:01,608 --> 00:24:03,569
And what would you
believe, Maximus?

195
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:06,864
They fought for you...
and for Rome.

196
00:24:06,947 --> 00:24:09,825
And what is Rome,
Maximus?

197
00:24:10,909 --> 00:24:13,370
I've seen much of
the rest of the world.

198
00:24:13,412 --> 00:24:17,374
It is brutal and cruel and dark.
Rome is the light.

199
00:24:17,457 --> 00:24:19,501
Yet you have
never been there.

200
00:24:19,585 --> 00:24:22,004
You have not seen
what it has become.

201
00:24:22,087 --> 00:24:25,132
I am dying, Maximus.

202
00:24:25,215 --> 00:24:27,134
When a man sees his end,

203
00:24:27,217 --> 00:24:30,721
he wants to know there was
some purpose this life.

204
00:24:30,804 --> 00:24:34,433
How will the world speak my name
in years to come?

205
00:24:34,516 --> 00:24:36,852
Will I be known
as the philosopher?

206
00:24:36,935 --> 00:24:40,189
The warrior?
The tyrant?

207
00:24:41,648 --> 00:24:46,278
Or will I be the emperor who
gave Rome back her true self?

208
00:24:47,321 --> 00:24:49,448
There was once a dream
that was Rome.

209
00:24:49,489 --> 00:24:52,576
You could only
whisper it.

210
00:24:52,659 --> 00:24:55,662
Anything more than a whisper
and it would vanish.

211
00:24:55,746 --> 00:24:57,915
It was so fragile.

212
00:24:57,998 --> 00:25:01,668
And I fear that it will not
survive the winter.

213
00:25:03,212 --> 00:25:05,506
Maximus,

214
00:25:05,589 --> 00:25:08,509
Let us whisper now,

215
00:25:08,592 --> 00:25:10,844
together, you and l.

216
00:25:10,928 --> 00:25:13,597
You have a son.

217
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:16,433
Tell me about your home.

218
00:25:22,397 --> 00:25:27,277
My house is in the hills above Tiujillo.
A very simple place.

219
00:25:28,779 --> 00:25:31,740
Pinkstones
that warm in the sun.

220
00:25:31,824 --> 00:25:35,828
A kitchen garden that
smells of herbs in the day,

221
00:25:35,911 --> 00:25:37,830
jasmine in the evening.

222
00:25:39,456 --> 00:25:42,417
Through the gate
is a giant poplar.

223
00:25:42,501 --> 00:25:45,337
Figs, apples, pears.

224
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:47,339
The soil, Marcus-
black.

225
00:25:47,422 --> 00:25:50,259
- Black like my wife's hair.

226
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:52,594
Grapes on the south slopes,
olives on the north.

227
00:25:52,636 --> 00:25:55,264
Wild ponies play near my house.
They tease my son.

228
00:25:55,305 --> 00:25:58,183
- He wants to be one of them.
- Remember the last time you were home?

229
00:25:58,267 --> 00:26:01,645
Two years, 264 days,
and this morning.

230
00:26:03,105 --> 00:26:05,482
I envy you, Maximus.

231
00:26:05,566 --> 00:26:09,278
It's a good home.
Worth fighting for.

232
00:26:11,405 --> 00:26:15,325
There is one more duty...

233
00:26:15,367 --> 00:26:18,662
that I ask of you
before you go home.

234
00:26:20,038 --> 00:26:22,291
What would you
have me do, Caesar?

235
00:26:22,374 --> 00:26:25,794
I want you to become
the protector of Rome after I die.

236
00:26:27,171 --> 00:26:30,174
I will empower you
to one end alone.

237
00:26:30,215 --> 00:26:34,511
To give power back
to the people of Rome...

238
00:26:34,553 --> 00:26:37,723
and end the corruption
that has crippled it.

239
00:26:43,854 --> 00:26:47,232
Will you accept this great honor
that I have offered you?

240
00:26:49,026 --> 00:26:52,029
With all my heart, no.

241
00:26:53,322 --> 00:26:55,616
Maximus,

242
00:26:55,699 --> 00:26:58,619
that is why
it must be you.

243
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,621
But surely a prefect,
a senator,

244
00:27:00,662 --> 00:27:03,540
somebody who knows the city,
who understands her politics.

245
00:27:03,624 --> 00:27:06,585
But you have not been
corrupted by her politics.

246
00:27:11,632 --> 00:27:15,886
- And Commodus?
- Commodus is not a moral man.

247
00:27:15,969 --> 00:27:18,222
You have known that
since you were young.

248
00:27:18,305 --> 00:27:20,891
Commodus cannot rule.

249
00:27:20,974 --> 00:27:23,227
He must not rule.

250
00:27:24,603 --> 00:27:27,314
You are the son
that I should have had.

251
00:27:30,025 --> 00:27:33,487
Commodus will accept
my decision.

252
00:27:35,364 --> 00:27:40,035
He knows that you command
the loyalty of the army.

253
00:27:43,664 --> 00:27:46,750
I- I need
some time, sire.

254
00:27:46,834 --> 00:27:48,752
Yes.

255
00:27:48,836 --> 00:27:52,840
By sunset,
I hope you will have agreed.

256
00:27:52,923 --> 00:27:55,884
Now embrace me as my son.

257
00:27:58,595 --> 00:28:01,306
And bring an old man
another blanket.

258
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:19,449
- My father favors you now.
- My lady.

259
00:28:19,533 --> 00:28:21,869
It was not always so.

260
00:28:21,952 --> 00:28:24,163
Many things change.

261
00:28:24,246 --> 00:28:27,040
Many things.
Not everything.

262
00:28:29,793 --> 00:28:31,795
Maximus, stop.

263
00:28:35,174 --> 00:28:38,135
Let me see your face.

264
00:28:38,177 --> 00:28:40,971
Hmm. You seem upset.

265
00:28:41,054 --> 00:28:43,182
I lost many men.

266
00:28:43,265 --> 00:28:46,101
What did my father
want with you?

267
00:28:46,185 --> 00:28:49,688
To wish me well
before I leave for home.

268
00:28:49,771 --> 00:28:51,815
You're lying.

269
00:28:51,899 --> 00:28:55,402
I could always tell when you were lying
because you were never any good at it.

270
00:28:55,485 --> 00:28:57,988
- I never acquired your comfort with it.
- True.

271
00:28:58,071 --> 00:29:00,657
But then you never had to.

272
00:29:00,741 --> 00:29:03,452
Life is more simple
for a soldier.

273
00:29:05,287 --> 00:29:08,540
Or do you
think me heartless?

274
00:29:08,582 --> 00:29:11,585
I think you have
a talent for survival.

275
00:29:17,299 --> 00:29:20,344
Maximus, stop.

276
00:29:20,427 --> 00:29:23,263
Is it really so terrible
seeing me again?

277
00:29:23,347 --> 00:29:27,059
No. I'm tired
from battle.

278
00:29:27,142 --> 00:29:29,937
It hurts you to see
my father so fragile.

279
00:29:33,106 --> 00:29:36,735
Commodus expects that my father will
announce his succession within days.

280
00:29:38,654 --> 00:29:42,115
Will you serve my brother
as you served his father?

281
00:29:44,201 --> 00:29:46,703
I will always serve Rome.

282
00:29:48,205 --> 00:29:50,165
Do you know,

283
00:29:50,207 --> 00:29:52,709
I still remember you
in my prayers.

284
00:29:53,794 --> 00:29:57,673
Oh, yes. I pray.

285
00:30:01,218 --> 00:30:04,179
I was sad to hear
of your husband's death. I mourned him.

286
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:09,226
- Thank you.
- And I hear you have a son.

287
00:30:10,936 --> 00:30:14,356
Yes. Lucius.

288
00:30:14,398 --> 00:30:16,692
He'll be nearly
eight years old.

289
00:30:16,733 --> 00:30:19,319
My son is also
nearly eight.

290
00:30:21,947 --> 00:30:24,074
I thank you
for your prayers.

291
00:30:31,999 --> 00:30:35,836
Ancestors, I ask for your guidance.

292
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:40,424
Blessed mother, come tome
with the gods' desire for my future.

293
00:30:40,507 --> 00:30:44,303
Blessed father, watch over
my wife and son with a ready sword.

294
00:30:46,054 --> 00:30:49,933
Whisper to them I live
only to hold them again.

295
00:30:49,975 --> 00:30:53,353
Ancestors, I honor you...

296
00:30:53,437 --> 00:30:56,857
and will try to live with
the dignity you have taught me.

297
00:31:18,754 --> 00:31:20,672
Cicero.

298
00:31:24,218 --> 00:31:26,887
Sir.

299
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:32,851
You don't find it hard
to do your duty?

300
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:39,525
Sometimes I do
what I want to do.

301
00:31:39,566 --> 00:31:42,361
The rest of the time
I do what I have to.

302
00:31:45,155 --> 00:31:48,075
We may not be able
to go home after all.

303
00:32:17,688 --> 00:32:20,858
Are you ready to do
your duty for Rome?

304
00:32:23,694 --> 00:32:26,155
Yes, Father.

305
00:32:26,196 --> 00:32:28,157
You will not be emperor.

306
00:32:30,993 --> 00:32:33,912
Which wiser,
older man is to take my place?

307
00:32:33,996 --> 00:32:37,291
My powers
will pass to Maximus...

308
00:32:37,374 --> 00:32:39,626
to hold
in trust...

309
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:44,256
until the Senate
is ready to rule once more.

310
00:32:44,339 --> 00:32:49,094
Rome is to be
a republic again.

311
00:32:50,387 --> 00:32:53,515
- Maximus.
- Yes.

312
00:32:58,604 --> 00:33:01,064
My decision
disappoints you?

313
00:33:04,902 --> 00:33:08,739
You wrote to me once,

314
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:12,659
Listing the four chief virtues.

315
00:33:12,743 --> 00:33:15,913
Wisdom, justice,

316
00:33:15,954 --> 00:33:19,291
fortitude and temperance.

317
00:33:21,793 --> 00:33:25,797
As I read the list,
I knew I had none of them.

318
00:33:25,881 --> 00:33:29,426
But I have other virtues, Father.

319
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:32,095
Ambition.

320
00:33:32,179 --> 00:33:35,140
That can be a virtue
when it drives us to excel.

321
00:33:36,475 --> 00:33:39,853
Resourcefulness.
Courage.

322
00:33:39,937 --> 00:33:43,148
Perhaps not on
the battlefield, but...

323
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:46,485
there are many forms of courage.

324
00:33:46,568 --> 00:33:49,822
Devotion-
to my family...

325
00:33:49,905 --> 00:33:52,449
and to you.

326
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:57,162
But none of my virtues
were on your list.

327
00:33:58,664 --> 00:34:01,583
Even then it was as if
you didn't want me for your son.

328
00:34:01,667 --> 00:34:04,169
Oh, Commodus.

329
00:34:04,253 --> 00:34:06,964
You go too far.

330
00:34:07,047 --> 00:34:10,634
I search the faces
of the gods...

331
00:34:10,717 --> 00:34:15,472
for ways to please you,
to make you proud.

332
00:34:15,556 --> 00:34:17,891
One kind word,

333
00:34:17,975 --> 00:34:20,310
one full hug...

334
00:34:20,394 --> 00:34:25,232
where you pressed me
to your chest and held me tight,

335
00:34:25,315 --> 00:34:28,277
would have been like the sun
on my heart for a thousand years.

336
00:34:31,446 --> 00:34:34,616
- What is it in me you hate so much?
- Shah, Commodus.

337
00:34:36,493 --> 00:34:38,745
All I've ever wanted...

338
00:34:38,829 --> 00:34:43,333
was to live up to you,
Caesar.

339
00:34:44,418 --> 00:34:46,336
Father.

340
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:49,006
Commodus.

341
00:34:51,341 --> 00:34:54,469
Your faults as a son...

342
00:34:54,511 --> 00:34:58,473
is my failure as a father.

343
00:35:08,525 --> 00:35:11,278
Come.

344
00:35:13,697 --> 00:35:16,116
Father.

345
00:35:30,422 --> 00:35:33,592
I would butcher
the whole world...

346
00:35:33,675 --> 00:35:36,386
if you would
only love me!

347
00:36:13,507 --> 00:36:17,594
Maximus, the Emperor needs you.
It's urgent.

348
00:36:22,349 --> 00:36:26,603
Lament with me, brother.
Our great father is dead.

349
00:36:53,964 --> 00:36:56,758
How did he die?

350
00:36:56,842 --> 00:36:59,511
The surgeons say there was no pain.

351
00:36:59,595 --> 00:37:01,680
His breath gave out
as he slept.

352
00:37:10,856 --> 00:37:12,774
Father.

353
00:37:15,152 --> 00:37:17,779
Your emperor asks
for your loyalty, Maximus.

354
00:37:19,406 --> 00:37:21,867
Take my hand.

355
00:37:23,744 --> 00:37:26,538
I only offer it once.

356
00:37:39,801 --> 00:37:41,720
Quintus.

357
00:38:31,311 --> 00:38:33,605
Hail, Caesar.

358
00:38:33,647 --> 00:38:36,441
I must go to the senators.
I need their counsel.

359
00:38:36,483 --> 00:38:39,069
- Wake Gaius and Falco.
- Gaius and Falco.

360
00:38:39,153 --> 00:38:41,363
- Sword.
- Sword.

361
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:46,368
Maximus, please be careful.
That was not prudent.

362
00:38:46,451 --> 00:38:49,830
Prudent?
The Emperor has been slain.

363
00:38:49,872 --> 00:38:53,125
The Emperor died of natural causes.

364
00:38:53,208 --> 00:38:56,211
- Why are you armed, Quintus?
- Guards!

365
00:38:59,381 --> 00:39:01,675
Please don't fight,
Maximus.

366
00:39:02,968 --> 00:39:06,013
I'm sorry. Caesar has spoken.

367
00:39:06,054 --> 00:39:10,642
Ride until dawn...
and then execute him.

368
00:39:10,726 --> 00:39:13,145
Quintus, look at me.
Look at me!

369
00:39:13,228 --> 00:39:16,315
Promise me that you will
look after my family.

370
00:39:17,482 --> 00:39:20,068
Your family will meet you
in the afterlife.

371
00:39:20,152 --> 00:39:21,403
- No!

372
00:39:45,469 --> 00:39:47,971
Kneel.

373
00:39:50,724 --> 00:39:53,101
Blessed Father,
watch over my wife and son.

374
00:39:53,143 --> 00:39:55,270
- Whisper to them that I live
only to hold them again.

375
00:39:57,856 --> 00:40:00,359
At least give me
a clean death.

376
00:40:00,485 --> 00:40:02,404
A soldier's death.

377
00:40:23,717 --> 00:40:27,220
The frost, sometimes it makes
the blade stick.

378
00:40:47,783 --> 00:40:49,743
Praetorian!

379
00:40:50,994 --> 00:40:53,580
Hyah! Hyah!

380
00:42:08,196 --> 00:42:11,116
Remember the last time you were home?

381
00:42:11,199 --> 00:42:15,746
Two years, 264 days, and this morning.

382
00:42:15,829 --> 00:42:20,167
Blessed Father, watch over my
wife and son with a ready sword.

383
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:23,587
Whisper to them I live only
to hold them again.

384
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:27,007
For all else is dust and air,
and I live only to hold them again.

385
00:42:28,342 --> 00:42:31,345
For all else is dust and air.

386
00:43:08,382 --> 00:43:11,760
- Mama, isoldati!

387
00:43:30,404 --> 00:43:32,614
- Papa! Papa!

388
00:43:37,869 --> 00:43:40,455
Hyah! Hyah!

389
00:46:17,029 --> 00:46:20,115
- Don't die.

390
00:46:24,953 --> 00:46:27,205
- You'll meet them again.

391
00:46:27,289 --> 00:46:30,500
- Not yet.

392
00:46:38,216 --> 00:46:42,679
No! They will clean it.
Wait and see.

393
00:47:16,463 --> 00:47:18,548
Don't die.

394
00:47:18,632 --> 00:47:20,967
They'll feed you
to the lions.

395
00:47:21,009 --> 00:47:23,011
They are worth more
than we are.

396
00:47:33,730 --> 00:47:35,774
Better now?

397
00:47:35,857 --> 00:47:37,818
Clean. You see?

398
00:48:08,473 --> 00:48:10,392
Proximo!

399
00:48:10,475 --> 00:48:12,978
My old friend.

400
00:48:13,061 --> 00:48:16,315
Every day is a great day
when you are here.

401
00:48:16,398 --> 00:48:21,028
Today...
is your most fortunate day.

402
00:48:23,447 --> 00:48:25,866
Those giraffes
you sold me...

403
00:48:25,949 --> 00:48:27,909
they won't mate.

404
00:48:27,951 --> 00:48:32,581
They just walk around
eating and not mating.

405
00:48:32,622 --> 00:48:36,043
You sold me...
queer giraffes.

406
00:48:36,126 --> 00:48:40,464
- I want my money back.
- Not a chance.

407
00:48:42,466 --> 00:48:46,178
- I do special price for you.
- On what?

408
00:48:47,971 --> 00:48:50,599
Have you seen my new stock?
Come and see them.

409
00:49:04,738 --> 00:49:07,532
Do any of them fight?
I've got a match coming up.

410
00:49:07,574 --> 00:49:10,285
Some are good for fighting,
others for dying.

411
00:49:10,369 --> 00:49:12,371
You need both, I think.

412
00:49:12,454 --> 00:49:14,414
Get up!

413
00:49:21,755 --> 00:49:25,717
- What's your trade?
- I was a hunter.

414
00:49:25,801 --> 00:49:29,721
Oh, no. I bought him
from a salt mine in Carthage.

415
00:49:29,763 --> 00:49:32,057
Sit down!

416
00:49:35,769 --> 00:49:38,063
Mark of the legion.

417
00:49:38,105 --> 00:49:41,233
- Deserter.
- Maybe so. But who cares?

418
00:49:41,274 --> 00:49:43,402
- He's a Spaniard.
- I'll take six...

419
00:49:43,485 --> 00:49:45,445
- for 1 ,000.
- 1,000?

420
00:49:45,487 --> 00:49:47,698
The Numidian alone
is worth 2,000!

421
00:49:47,781 --> 00:49:50,450
These slaves
are rotten.

422
00:49:50,534 --> 00:49:52,744
It all adds to the flavor.
No. No, no, no. Wait-Wait.

423
00:49:52,828 --> 00:49:56,748
Wait! Can negotiate.

424
00:49:56,832 --> 00:50:01,294
I'll give you 2,000...
and four for the beasts.

425
00:50:01,378 --> 00:50:04,881
That's 5,000
for an old friend.

426
00:50:20,856 --> 00:50:23,525
Come on! How long does it take
to get into my own house?

427
00:50:23,567 --> 00:50:26,403
I am Proximo!

428
00:50:26,486 --> 00:50:29,489
I shall be closer to you
for the next few days,

429
00:50:29,573 --> 00:50:33,118
which will be last of your miserable
lives, than that bitch of a mother...

430
00:50:33,201 --> 00:50:36,121
- that brought you screaming
into this world!

431
00:50:36,204 --> 00:50:40,083
I did not pay good money
for you for your company!

432
00:50:40,167 --> 00:50:45,505
- I paid it so that I could
profit from your death.

433
00:50:45,589 --> 00:50:49,343
And as your mother
was there at your beginning,

434
00:50:49,426 --> 00:50:52,721
so I shall be there
at your end.

435
00:50:52,763 --> 00:50:57,476
- And when you die, and die you shall,

436
00:50:57,559 --> 00:51:00,520
your transition shall be
to the sound of-

437
00:51:05,651 --> 00:51:09,321
Gladiators, I salute you.

438
00:51:13,659 --> 00:51:16,370
-Red!
-Red.

439
00:51:16,453 --> 00:51:20,707
- Yellow!

440
00:51:20,791 --> 00:51:23,210
Yellow.

441
00:51:31,677 --> 00:51:32,844
Hyah!

442
00:51:32,886 --> 00:51:35,222
Good.

443
00:51:35,305 --> 00:51:36,765
- Red.
- Red!

444
00:51:41,478 --> 00:51:43,397
Spaniard!

445
00:52:08,046 --> 00:52:10,882
- Uhh.

446
00:52:16,638 --> 00:52:19,057
That's enough
for the moment!

447
00:52:19,141 --> 00:52:21,643
His time will come.

448
00:52:22,728 --> 00:52:24,938
Next!

449
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:42,497
Spaniard, why don't you fight?

450
00:52:42,539 --> 00:52:45,167
We all have to fight.

451
00:52:58,555 --> 00:53:00,599
Is that the sign
of your gods?

452
00:53:05,771 --> 00:53:08,857
Will that not anger them?

453
00:53:29,503 --> 00:53:31,505
The gods favor you.

454
00:53:31,588 --> 00:53:34,549
Red is the gods' color.

455
00:53:34,633 --> 00:53:37,969
You will need
their help today.

456
00:53:54,486 --> 00:53:58,323
Some of you are thinking
you won't fight.

457
00:53:58,407 --> 00:54:00,742
Some that you can't fight.

458
00:54:02,202 --> 00:54:06,206
They all say that,
until they're out there.

459
00:54:08,208 --> 00:54:11,169
- Listen.
-Kill. Kill. Kill.

460
00:54:11,211 --> 00:54:13,714
Kill. Kill. Kill.

461
00:54:19,386 --> 00:54:21,847
Thrust this
into another man's flesh,

462
00:54:21,930 --> 00:54:24,808
and then they will applaud
and love you for that.

463
00:54:24,891 --> 00:54:28,145
You-

464
00:54:28,228 --> 00:54:30,564
You may begin
to love them...

465
00:54:30,605 --> 00:54:33,442
for that.

466
00:54:36,820 --> 00:54:40,991
Ultimately,
we're all dead men.

467
00:54:42,743 --> 00:54:46,496
Sadly, we cannot
choose how, but...

468
00:54:46,580 --> 00:54:50,167
we can decide how
we meet that end...

469
00:54:50,250 --> 00:54:54,129
in order that
we are remembered...

470
00:54:54,212 --> 00:54:56,173
as men.

471
00:55:00,552 --> 00:55:03,305
On the left,
draw your shields!

472
00:55:03,347 --> 00:55:06,391
On the right,
draw your swords!

473
00:55:06,475 --> 00:55:08,435
-Kill. Kill-

474
00:55:09,645 --> 00:55:13,649
Pair them up-
red with yellow.

475
00:55:16,777 --> 00:55:18,111
Next!

476
00:55:21,615 --> 00:55:23,033
Next!

477
00:57:17,147 --> 00:57:19,316
- Hyah! Hyah!

478
00:59:06,506 --> 00:59:09,176
- Go away!

479
00:59:39,331 --> 00:59:42,459
He enters Rome
like a conquering hero.

480
00:59:42,542 --> 00:59:44,503
But what
has he conquered?

481
00:59:44,586 --> 00:59:47,589
Give him time, Gracchus.
He's young.

482
00:59:47,673 --> 00:59:49,633
I think he could do very well.

483
00:59:49,675 --> 00:59:51,635
For Rome or for you?

484
00:59:57,724 --> 01:00:00,477
Go to your mother, Lucius.
It's what she'd like.

485
01:00:07,109 --> 01:00:10,821
- Lucius!
- Mother!

486
01:00:11,863 --> 01:00:15,993
- Hail, Caesar.
- Senators.

487
01:00:18,787 --> 01:00:21,665
Rome greets
her new emperor.

488
01:00:21,707 --> 01:00:25,210
Your loyal subjects
bid you welcome, Highness.

489
01:00:25,293 --> 01:00:28,714
Thank you, Falco.
And for the loyal subjects,

490
01:00:28,755 --> 01:00:32,259
- I trust they weren't too expensive.
- Caesar.

491
01:00:32,342 --> 01:00:36,430
- Gracchus.
- All Rome rejoices
in your return, Caesar.

492
01:00:36,513 --> 01:00:38,682
There are many matters
that require your attention.

493
01:00:42,185 --> 01:00:45,188
- To order! To order!

494
01:00:45,230 --> 01:00:49,985
For your guidance, Caesar, the Senate
has prepared a series of protocols...

495
01:00:50,068 --> 01:00:53,488
to begin addressing
the many problems in the city.

496
01:00:53,572 --> 01:00:57,743
Beginning with basic sanitation
for the Greek quarter...

497
01:00:57,826 --> 01:01:00,954
to combat the plague which is already
springing up there.

498
01:01:01,038 --> 01:01:04,458
- So, if Caesar-
- Shah.

499
01:01:05,625 --> 01:01:08,670
Don't you see, Gracchus?

500
01:01:08,754 --> 01:01:10,964
That's the very problem,
isn't it?

501
01:01:11,048 --> 01:01:14,134
My father spent
all his time at study...

502
01:01:15,927 --> 01:01:19,765
of books and learning
and philosophy.

503
01:01:19,806 --> 01:01:24,895
He spent his twilight hours
reading scrolls from the Senate.

504
01:01:24,978 --> 01:01:28,315
And all the while,
the people have forgotten-

505
01:01:28,398 --> 01:01:30,817
But the Senate
is the People, sire.

506
01:01:30,859 --> 01:01:34,613
Chosen from among the people...
to speak for the people.

507
01:01:34,696 --> 01:01:39,284
I doubt that many of the people
eat so well as you do, Gracchus.

508
01:01:39,368 --> 01:01:44,539
Or have such splendid mistresses, Gaius.
I think I understand my own people.

509
01:01:44,623 --> 01:01:48,335
Then, perhaps Caesar will
be so good as to teach us...

510
01:01:48,418 --> 01:01:50,671
out of his own
extensive experience.

511
01:01:54,549 --> 01:01:56,551
- I call it love.

512
01:01:56,593 --> 01:02:00,514
- I am their father.
The people are my children.

513
01:02:00,597 --> 01:02:02,808
And I shall hold them to my bosom
and embrace them tightly.

514
01:02:02,891 --> 01:02:05,352
Have you ever embraced someone
dying of plague, sire?

515
01:02:12,275 --> 01:02:17,864
No, but if you interrupt me again,
I assure you that you shall.

516
01:02:17,948 --> 01:02:20,909
Senator, my brother
is very tired.

517
01:02:20,951 --> 01:02:23,537
Leave your list with me.

518
01:02:23,620 --> 01:02:26,289
Caesar shall do
all that Rome requires.

519
01:02:26,373 --> 01:02:31,253
My lady, as always,
your lightest touch commands obedience.

520
01:02:38,218 --> 01:02:40,804
Who are they
to lecture me?

521
01:02:40,887 --> 01:02:43,473
Commodus, the Senate has its uses.

522
01:02:43,557 --> 01:02:46,310
What uses?
All they do is talk.

523
01:02:47,769 --> 01:02:50,772
It should be just...
you and me...

524
01:02:50,856 --> 01:02:53,400
- and Rome.
- Don't even think it!

525
01:02:53,483 --> 01:02:55,902
There's always
been a Senate.

526
01:02:55,986 --> 01:03:00,282
Rome has changed.
It takes an emperor...

527
01:03:00,365 --> 01:03:03,201
-to rule an empire.
-Of course, but leave the people their-

528
01:03:03,243 --> 01:03:05,871
Illusions.

529
01:03:05,954 --> 01:03:08,206
Traditions.

530
01:03:08,290 --> 01:03:11,543
My father's war
against the barbarians-

531
01:03:11,626 --> 01:03:14,338
He said it himself,
it achieved nothing.

532
01:03:14,421 --> 01:03:17,549
- But the people loved him.
- The people always love victories.

533
01:03:17,632 --> 01:03:22,512
Why? They didn't see the battles.

534
01:03:22,596 --> 01:03:26,558
- What do they care about Germania?
- They care about the greatness of Rome.

535
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:30,520
The greatness of Rome.

536
01:03:30,604 --> 01:03:33,315
Well, what is that?

537
01:03:35,025 --> 01:03:39,154
It's an idea-
greatness.

538
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:46,453
- Greatness is a vision.
- Exactly. A vision.

539
01:03:47,621 --> 01:03:51,208
Do you not see, Lucilla?

540
01:03:51,291 --> 01:03:55,921
I will give the people a vision of Rome,
and they'll love me for it.

541
01:03:56,004 --> 01:04:00,550
And they'll soon forget the tedious
sermonizing of a few dry, old men.

542
01:04:12,104 --> 01:04:15,357
I will give the people
the greatest vision of their lives.

543
01:05:05,157 --> 01:05:09,202
Vino, vino, vino!
White and red wine
for your drinking pleasure!

544
01:05:11,496 --> 01:05:17,336
Vino, vino, vino! Red and white wine
for your drinking pleasure!

545
01:05:17,377 --> 01:05:19,338
Games.

546
01:05:21,131 --> 01:05:24,051
1 50 days of games.

547
01:05:24,134 --> 01:05:27,763
- He's cleverer than I thought.
- Oh, clever.

548
01:05:27,846 --> 01:05:30,515
The whole of Rome would
be laughing at him...

549
01:05:30,599 --> 01:05:33,185
if they weren't so afraid
of his Praetorians.

550
01:05:33,268 --> 01:05:36,730
Fear and wonder-
a powerful combination.

551
01:05:36,813 --> 01:05:39,650
You really think the people
are going to be seduced by that?

552
01:05:39,733 --> 01:05:44,029
I think he knows what Rome is.
Rome is the mob.

553
01:05:44,071 --> 01:05:47,407
Conjure magic for them,
and they'll be distracted.

554
01:05:47,449 --> 01:05:51,536
Take away their freedom
and still they'll roar.

555
01:05:51,578 --> 01:05:54,164
The beating heart
of Rome...

556
01:05:54,247 --> 01:05:56,458
is not the marble
of the Senate.

557
01:05:56,541 --> 01:05:58,919
It's the sand
of the Colosseum.

558
01:06:00,003 --> 01:06:02,297
He'll bring them death,

559
01:06:03,882 --> 01:06:06,677
and they will
love him for it.

560
01:06:10,847 --> 01:06:15,435
Spaniard! Spaniard!
Spaniard! Spaniard!

561
01:06:27,948 --> 01:06:30,158
Spaniard.

562
01:06:30,242 --> 01:06:32,661
- Spain.
- Spaniard.
- Spaniard.

563
01:06:32,703 --> 01:06:35,872
- Spaniard.
- Spaniard.
- Spaniard.

564
01:06:37,582 --> 01:06:39,501
Guard!

565
01:07:42,648 --> 01:07:45,442
- Are you not entertained?

566
01:07:45,525 --> 01:07:47,778
Are you not entertained?

567
01:07:50,322 --> 01:07:53,033
Is this not why you are here?

568
01:07:57,537 --> 01:08:01,041
Spaniard! Spaniard!
Spaniard! Spaniard!

569
01:08:01,124 --> 01:08:05,420
Spaniard! Spaniard! Spaniard! Spaniard!

570
01:08:08,048 --> 01:08:10,425
Spaniard! Spaniard! Spaniard!

571
01:08:10,509 --> 01:08:14,513
Spaniard! Spaniard!
Spaniard! Spaniard!

572
01:08:16,848 --> 01:08:19,726
What do you want?

573
01:08:19,810 --> 01:08:21,812
Huh?

574
01:08:21,895 --> 01:08:23,814
Girl?

575
01:08:23,897 --> 01:08:25,816
Boy?

576
01:08:25,899 --> 01:08:29,027
- You sent for me?
- Yes, I did.

577
01:08:29,111 --> 01:08:32,280
You're good, Spaniard,
but you're not that good.

578
01:08:32,364 --> 01:08:35,993
- You could be magnificent.
- I'm required to kill, so I kill.

579
01:08:36,076 --> 01:08:37,995
That is enough.

580
01:08:38,078 --> 01:08:41,456
That's enough for the provinces,
but not for Rome.

581
01:08:43,917 --> 01:08:46,211
- The young emperor...

582
01:08:46,294 --> 01:08:49,256
has arranged
a series of spectacles...

583
01:08:49,297 --> 01:08:53,719
to commemorate his father,
Marcus Aurelius.

584
01:08:53,802 --> 01:08:55,762
I find that amusing...

585
01:08:55,846 --> 01:08:57,806
since it was Marcus Aurelius-

586
01:08:57,848 --> 01:09:00,642
the wise, the all-knowing
Marcus Aurelius-

587
01:09:00,684 --> 01:09:02,936
- that closed us down.

588
01:09:05,522 --> 01:09:09,484
So, finally, after five years
of scratching a living...

589
01:09:09,568 --> 01:09:12,154
in flea-infested
villages,

590
01:09:12,195 --> 01:09:15,532
we're finally going back
to where we belong-

591
01:09:15,574 --> 01:09:17,701
the Colosseum.

592
01:09:17,784 --> 01:09:22,205
Oh, you should see
the Colosseum, Spaniard.

593
01:09:23,498 --> 01:09:26,835
Fifty-thousand Romans...

594
01:09:26,877 --> 01:09:30,881
watching...
every movement of your sword,

595
01:09:30,964 --> 01:09:34,301
willing you to make
that killer blow.

596
01:09:35,552 --> 01:09:38,096
The silence before you strike...

597
01:09:38,180 --> 01:09:40,223
and the noise afterwards,

598
01:09:40,265 --> 01:09:43,310
it rises-
it rises up like-

599
01:09:43,393 --> 01:09:47,481
Like th-
Like- Like a storm...

600
01:09:47,564 --> 01:09:49,566
as if you were
the thunder god himself.

601
01:09:49,650 --> 01:09:53,695
- You were a gladiator?
- Yes, I was.

602
01:09:59,826 --> 01:10:01,787
You won your freedom?

603
01:10:01,828 --> 01:10:05,457
A long time ago,
the emperor...

604
01:10:05,499 --> 01:10:08,043
presented me
with a rudius.

605
01:10:08,126 --> 01:10:10,962
It's just a wooden sword.

606
01:10:12,506 --> 01:10:16,635
The symbol of your freedom.
He-

607
01:10:16,718 --> 01:10:21,306
- He touched me on the shoulder,
and I was free.

608
01:10:21,348 --> 01:10:25,185
- You knew Marcus Aurelius?
- I did not say I knew him.

609
01:10:25,227 --> 01:10:27,437
I said he touched me
on the shoulder once.

610
01:10:28,814 --> 01:10:32,192
You asked me what I want.

611
01:10:32,234 --> 01:10:34,820
I, too, want to stand
in front of the emperor...

612
01:10:36,113 --> 01:10:38,031
as you did.

613
01:10:38,115 --> 01:10:41,952
Then, listen to me.
Learn from me.

614
01:10:42,035 --> 01:10:46,206
I wasn't the best
because I killed quickly.

615
01:10:46,289 --> 01:10:49,876
I was the best
because the crowd loved me.

616
01:10:49,960 --> 01:10:55,048
Win the crowd,
and you'll win your freedom.

617
01:10:57,801 --> 01:11:00,178
I will win the crowd.

618
01:11:01,888 --> 01:11:06,393
- I will give them something
they have never seen before.
- Ha!

619
01:11:06,435 --> 01:11:10,147
So, Spaniard,
we shall go to Rome together...

620
01:11:10,230 --> 01:11:12,232
and have bloody adventures!

621
01:11:12,316 --> 01:11:14,401
And the great whore
will suckle us until we are...

622
01:11:14,484 --> 01:11:16,611
fat and happy and
can suckle no more.

623
01:11:16,695 --> 01:11:19,197
And then,

624
01:11:19,281 --> 01:11:23,035
when enough men have died,

625
01:11:23,118 --> 01:11:25,078
perhaps you will
have your freedom.

626
01:11:30,625 --> 01:11:33,378
Here. Use this.

627
01:11:55,400 --> 01:11:57,611
It's somewhere out there-

628
01:11:57,694 --> 01:12:02,532
my country, my home.

629
01:12:02,574 --> 01:12:06,370
My wife is preparing food.

630
01:12:06,411 --> 01:12:09,873
My daughters carry
water from the river.

631
01:12:09,915 --> 01:12:12,250
Will I ever
see them again?

632
01:12:12,292 --> 01:12:14,378
I think no.

633
01:12:14,461 --> 01:12:17,422
Do you believe you'll see
them again when you die?

634
01:12:17,506 --> 01:12:20,008
I think so.

635
01:12:20,092 --> 01:12:24,471
But then, I will die soon.

636
01:12:24,554 --> 01:12:26,473
They will not die
for many years.

637
01:12:28,183 --> 01:12:32,229
- I'll have to wait.
- But you would... wait.

638
01:12:32,312 --> 01:12:35,941
Of course.

639
01:12:36,024 --> 01:12:38,443
You see,

640
01:12:38,485 --> 01:12:43,323
my wife...
and my son...

641
01:12:43,365 --> 01:12:45,325
are already
waiting for me.

642
01:12:45,409 --> 01:12:47,911
You'll meet them again.

643
01:12:47,995 --> 01:12:51,164
But not yet.

644
01:12:54,042 --> 01:12:57,254
Not yet. Unless-

645
01:12:57,337 --> 01:12:59,256
Not yet.

646
01:13:02,342 --> 01:13:04,803
Not yet.

647
01:14:07,032 --> 01:14:09,660
Out!

648
01:14:09,743 --> 01:14:11,912
Go, go. Out!

649
01:14:24,174 --> 01:14:26,176
Good to see you again,
old friend.

650
01:14:31,515 --> 01:14:33,433
Bring me fortune.

651
01:14:38,188 --> 01:14:41,400
Have you ever seen
anything like that before?

652
01:14:41,441 --> 01:14:45,529
- I didn't know men
could build such things.

653
01:14:54,746 --> 01:14:56,665
Win the crowd.

654
01:14:56,748 --> 01:15:00,377
Get Inside! Move. Inside.

655
01:15:49,718 --> 01:15:52,804
He sleeps so well
because he's loved.

656
01:15:55,265 --> 01:15:59,394
Come, brother.
It's late.

657
01:16:01,021 --> 01:16:03,982
I will make Rome
the wonder of the ages.

658
01:16:06,318 --> 01:16:09,404
That is what Gracchus
and his friends don't understand.

659
01:16:09,488 --> 01:16:14,284
All my desires are splitting
my head to pieces.

660
01:16:20,749 --> 01:16:23,377
Commodus,
drink this tonic.

661
01:16:32,594 --> 01:16:36,223
I think the time
is almost right.

662
01:16:36,306 --> 01:16:38,433
I could announce
the dissolution of the Senate...

663
01:16:38,517 --> 01:16:40,435
at the celebration
to honor our father.

664
01:16:40,519 --> 01:16:43,647
You think I should?

665
01:16:43,689 --> 01:16:45,691
Are the people ready?

666
01:16:47,275 --> 01:16:49,236
I think you need
your rest now.

667
01:16:55,867 --> 01:16:59,579
- Will you stay with me?
- Still afraid of the dark, brother?

668
01:17:07,087 --> 01:17:12,926
Still. Always.

669
01:17:13,010 --> 01:17:15,929
- Stay with me tonight?
- You know I won't.

670
01:17:19,933 --> 01:17:21,852
Then, kiss me.

671
01:17:30,944 --> 01:17:33,655
Sleep, brother.

672
01:17:51,173 --> 01:17:53,550
Come on now.
Get out of the way!

673
01:17:58,347 --> 01:18:01,183
I want you. I want you.
I want you so-

674
01:18:01,266 --> 01:18:03,518
All right, Let him pass!

675
01:18:19,743 --> 01:18:22,079
-Sixty!

676
01:18:22,162 --> 01:18:25,707
-500!

677
01:18:25,749 --> 01:18:28,919
The emperor wants battles, and I don't
want to sacrifice my best fighters.

678
01:18:29,002 --> 01:18:32,547
The crowd wants battles,
so the emperor gives them battles.

679
01:18:32,589 --> 01:18:34,883
And you get
the battle of Carthage.

680
01:18:34,925 --> 01:18:38,428
The massacre of Carthage.
Guten tag.

681
01:18:38,512 --> 01:18:41,723
Oh, why don't you go down
to the prison and round up
all the beggars and thieves.

682
01:18:41,765 --> 01:18:43,725
We've done that.

683
01:18:43,809 --> 01:18:46,687
If you want to give away
the best gladiators
in the whole of the empire,

684
01:18:46,770 --> 01:18:49,231
I want double the rates.

685
01:18:49,314 --> 01:18:52,776
You'll get your contract rates,
or you'll get your contract cancelled.

686
01:18:52,859 --> 01:18:54,820
You don't like it?

687
01:18:54,861 --> 01:18:58,824
Then you can crawl back down
that shithole that you came from.

688
01:19:00,492 --> 01:19:03,412
-Cassius, please! Please, Cassius!

689
01:19:33,692 --> 01:19:36,320
Gladiator, are you the one
they call the Spaniard?

690
01:19:36,403 --> 01:19:40,407
- Yes.
- They said you were a giant.

691
01:19:40,490 --> 01:19:43,660
They said you could
crush a man's skull with one hand.

692
01:19:43,744 --> 01:19:46,997
A man's? No.

693
01:19:47,080 --> 01:19:49,875
A boy's.

694
01:19:51,335 --> 01:19:54,880
- They have good horses in Spain?
- Some of the best.

695
01:19:54,963 --> 01:19:59,343
This is Argento,
and this is Scarto.

696
01:19:59,426 --> 01:20:02,471
They were my horses.

697
01:20:02,554 --> 01:20:07,142
- They were taken from me.
- I like you, Spaniard.

698
01:20:07,225 --> 01:20:09,728
- I shall cheer for you.
- They let you watch the games?

699
01:20:09,811 --> 01:20:13,440
- My uncle says it makes me strong.
- And what does your father say?

700
01:20:13,523 --> 01:20:15,484
My father's dead.

701
01:20:17,110 --> 01:20:20,614
Master Lucius, it is time.

702
01:20:20,697 --> 01:20:24,326
- I have to go.
- Your name is Lucius?

703
01:20:26,036 --> 01:20:28,413
Lucius Verus,
after my father.

704
01:20:58,527 --> 01:21:00,696
Lower!

705
01:21:05,617 --> 01:21:09,538
-Claudius! More shields!
- Yes, sir.

706
01:21:29,850 --> 01:21:32,644
When the emperor enters,

707
01:21:32,728 --> 01:21:36,898
raise your weapons,
salute him and then speak together!

708
01:21:38,191 --> 01:21:42,195
Face the emperor and don't
turn your back on him!

709
01:21:42,279 --> 01:21:46,074
Go, and die with honor!

710
01:22:40,629 --> 01:22:43,256
Hail, mighty Caesar!

711
01:22:43,298 --> 01:22:47,260
Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!

712
01:22:47,344 --> 01:22:49,846
Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!

713
01:22:53,266 --> 01:22:55,936
And we who are about to die, salute you!

714
01:22:57,145 --> 01:23:00,190
On this day,

715
01:23:00,273 --> 01:23:04,152
we reach back
to hallowed antiquity...

716
01:23:04,194 --> 01:23:07,614
to bring you a recreation
of the second fall...

717
01:23:07,698 --> 01:23:09,741
of mighty Carthage!

718
01:23:13,870 --> 01:23:18,667
On the barren
plain of Zama,

719
01:23:18,750 --> 01:23:22,129
there stood
the invincible armies...

720
01:23:22,212 --> 01:23:25,382
of the barbarian, Hannibal.

721
01:23:25,424 --> 01:23:28,552
Ferocious mercenaries and warriors...

722
01:23:28,593 --> 01:23:31,263
from all brute nations...

723
01:23:31,346 --> 01:23:34,516
bent on merciless...

724
01:23:34,599 --> 01:23:38,312
destruction, conquest.

725
01:23:38,395 --> 01:23:42,441
Your emperor
is pleased to give you...

726
01:23:42,524 --> 01:23:45,277
the barbarian horde!

727
01:23:54,161 --> 01:23:57,414
- Anyone here been in the army?
- No.
- Yes.

728
01:23:57,497 --> 01:23:59,541
I served
with you at Vindobona.

729
01:23:59,624 --> 01:24:02,502
You can help me.

730
01:24:02,586 --> 01:24:06,256
Whatever comes
out of these gates,

731
01:24:06,340 --> 01:24:09,134
we've got a better chance
of survival if we work together.

732
01:24:10,510 --> 01:24:12,638
Do you understand?

733
01:24:13,680 --> 01:24:16,475
If we stay together,
we survive.

734
01:24:16,516 --> 01:24:19,144
I'm pleased to bring you
the legionnaires...

735
01:24:19,186 --> 01:24:23,857
of Scipio Africanus!

736
01:24:34,409 --> 01:24:36,870
To the death!

737
01:24:39,122 --> 01:24:44,044
- Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!

738
01:24:45,921 --> 01:24:47,506
Stay close!

739
01:24:53,303 --> 01:24:55,555
Come together!

740
01:24:55,597 --> 01:24:58,183
- Staggered columns!

741
01:24:58,266 --> 01:25:00,477
Staggered columns!

742
01:25:12,447 --> 01:25:14,366
Soon all your men
will be slain.

743
01:25:14,449 --> 01:25:16,368
You don't have a chance!

744
01:25:27,462 --> 01:25:28,964
Lock your shields! Stay as one!

745
01:25:29,006 --> 01:25:31,008
As one! As one!

746
01:25:31,091 --> 01:25:32,676
Hold!

747
01:25:34,803 --> 01:25:36,388
Hold!

748
01:25:36,471 --> 01:25:38,557
- As one!
- As one!

749
01:25:40,892 --> 01:25:42,602
Well done!

750
01:25:45,647 --> 01:25:47,983
Hyah! Hyah!

751
01:25:54,114 --> 01:25:55,699
Hold!

752
01:25:55,782 --> 01:25:58,744
Diamond! Diamond!

753
01:26:03,415 --> 01:26:05,250
- Yes!

754
01:26:17,054 --> 01:26:18,930
- Haken!

755
01:26:42,412 --> 01:26:44,790
This column to the chariots!
This column...

756
01:26:44,831 --> 01:26:46,667
-stay with me!

757
01:26:49,586 --> 01:26:51,338
Quickly!

758
01:26:51,421 --> 01:26:54,174
- Get out there!
- Hurry!

759
01:27:35,632 --> 01:27:37,676
Maximus!

760
01:27:40,804 --> 01:27:42,055
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh.

761
01:27:48,145 --> 01:27:51,064
Single column!
Single column!

762
01:27:51,148 --> 01:27:52,774
Single column! Single column!

763
01:28:36,735 --> 01:28:39,404
- We win!

764
01:28:43,325 --> 01:28:46,745
My history's
a little hazy, Cassius.

765
01:28:46,787 --> 01:28:49,706
But shouldn't the barbarians
lose the battle of Carthage?

766
01:28:49,790 --> 01:28:52,125
Uh, yes, sire.

767
01:28:52,167 --> 01:28:54,461
Um, forgive me, sire.

768
01:28:54,503 --> 01:28:58,215
No, I rather
enjoy surprises.

769
01:28:58,298 --> 01:29:03,512
- Who is he?
- They call him the Spaniard, sire.

770
01:29:05,055 --> 01:29:09,476
- I think I'll meet him.
- Yes, sire.

771
01:29:09,559 --> 01:29:13,563
Hail to the barbarians!

772
01:29:27,661 --> 01:29:32,332
Forward! Arms at ready!

773
01:29:44,261 --> 01:29:46,513
Drop your weapons!

774
01:29:48,765 --> 01:29:53,395
Gladiator, the emperor
has asked for you.

775
01:29:53,437 --> 01:29:55,439
I'm at the emperor's service.

776
01:30:22,382 --> 01:30:26,553
Rise. Rise.

777
01:30:34,186 --> 01:30:36,396
Your fame is well deserved,
Spaniard.

778
01:30:36,480 --> 01:30:39,483
I don't think there's ever
been a gladiator to match you.

779
01:30:39,524 --> 01:30:42,069
As for this young man,
he insists you are Hector reborn.

780
01:30:42,152 --> 01:30:44,738
Or was it Hercules?

781
01:30:44,821 --> 01:30:48,659
Why doesn't the hero reveal himself
and tell us all your real name?

782
01:30:50,661 --> 01:30:55,499
- You do have a name?
- My name is Gladiator.

783
01:30:58,418 --> 01:31:00,921
- How dare you show your back to me?

784
01:31:01,004 --> 01:31:03,423
Slave!

785
01:31:03,507 --> 01:31:05,550
You will remove your helmet
and tell me your name.

786
01:31:17,479 --> 01:31:20,399
My name is
Maximus Decimus Meridius,

787
01:31:20,440 --> 01:31:22,818
commander of the armies
of the north,

788
01:31:22,901 --> 01:31:25,654
general of the Felix Legions,

789
01:31:25,737 --> 01:31:30,158
Loyal servant to the true emperor,
Marcus Aurelius,

790
01:31:30,242 --> 01:31:32,703
father to a murdered son,

791
01:31:32,786 --> 01:31:35,580
husband to a murdered wife...

792
01:31:35,664 --> 01:31:39,251
and I will have my vengeance...
in this life or the next.

793
01:31:45,841 --> 01:31:48,969
Arms!

794
01:32:00,105 --> 01:32:04,609
Live! Live! Live!
Live! Live! Live!

795
01:32:04,693 --> 01:32:10,365
Live! Live! Live!
Live! Live! Live!

796
01:32:12,451 --> 01:32:15,120
Live! Live! Live!

797
01:32:15,203 --> 01:32:18,707
Live! Live!
Live! Live!

798
01:32:51,406 --> 01:32:54,951
Guards, at rest!

799
01:33:44,167 --> 01:33:48,797
Maximus! Maximus!
Maximus! Maximus!

800
01:33:48,880 --> 01:33:52,092
Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!

801
01:33:52,175 --> 01:33:55,178
Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!

802
01:34:15,490 --> 01:34:18,702
Why is he still alive?

803
01:34:18,785 --> 01:34:20,912
I don't know.

804
01:34:20,996 --> 01:34:23,248
He shouldn't be alive.

805
01:34:23,332 --> 01:34:26,168
It vexes me.

806
01:34:26,209 --> 01:34:29,171
I'm terribly vexed.

807
01:34:39,139 --> 01:34:41,058
I did what I had to do.

808
01:34:41,141 --> 01:34:46,021
If Father had had his way,
the empire would have been torn apart.

809
01:34:46,063 --> 01:34:48,315
You do see that?

810
01:34:48,398 --> 01:34:50,317
Yes.

811
01:34:54,029 --> 01:34:57,449
What did you feel...
when you saw him?

812
01:34:59,701 --> 01:35:02,579
I felt nothing.

813
01:35:02,621 --> 01:35:05,624
He wounded you deeply,
didn't he?

814
01:35:06,750 --> 01:35:10,128
No more than
I wounded him.

815
01:35:13,632 --> 01:35:15,968
They lied to me in Germania.

816
01:35:17,219 --> 01:35:20,055
They told me he was dead.

817
01:35:21,348 --> 01:35:24,267
If they lie to me,
they don't respect me.

818
01:35:24,309 --> 01:35:27,020
If they don't respect me,
how can they ever love me?

819
01:35:28,897 --> 01:35:31,608
Then you must
let the legions know...

820
01:35:31,692 --> 01:35:35,237
their treachery
will not go unpunished.

821
01:35:35,320 --> 01:35:39,700
Poor sister, I wouldn't
want to be your enemy.

822
01:35:40,826 --> 01:35:43,161
What will you do?

823
01:35:54,381 --> 01:35:56,300
This way!

824
01:36:30,710 --> 01:36:33,880
Rich matrons pay well to be pleasured
by the bravest champions.

825
01:36:33,964 --> 01:36:36,967
I knew your brother
would send assassins.

826
01:36:37,050 --> 01:36:39,761
I didn't realize
he would send his best.

827
01:36:41,263 --> 01:36:44,182
Maximus,
he doesn't know.

828
01:36:44,224 --> 01:36:47,185
My family was burned and crucified
while they were still alive.

829
01:36:47,227 --> 01:36:50,188
- I knew nothing-
- Don't lie to me!

830
01:36:56,736 --> 01:36:59,990
- I wept for them.
- As you wept for your father?

831
01:37:00,031 --> 01:37:02,742
As you wept for
your father?

832
01:37:02,826 --> 01:37:06,496
I have been living in
a prison of fear since that day.

833
01:37:06,538 --> 01:37:11,209
To be unable to mourn your father
for fear of your brother.

834
01:37:11,251 --> 01:37:14,212
To live in terror
every moment of every day...

835
01:37:14,254 --> 01:37:16,548
because your son
is heir to the throne.

836
01:37:18,633 --> 01:37:21,845
Oh, I have wept.

837
01:37:21,928 --> 01:37:25,098
My son was innocent.

838
01:37:25,182 --> 01:37:27,851
So is mine.

839
01:37:29,352 --> 01:37:32,272
Must my son die, too,
before you will trust me?

840
01:37:34,316 --> 01:37:38,111
What does it matter
if I trust you or not?

841
01:37:38,195 --> 01:37:41,072
The gods have spared you.
Don't you understand?

842
01:37:41,114 --> 01:37:44,618
Today I saw a slave become
more powerful than the emperor of Rome.

843
01:37:44,701 --> 01:37:46,745
The gods
have spared me?

844
01:37:46,828 --> 01:37:50,207
I am at their mercy,
with the power only to amuse a mob!

845
01:37:50,290 --> 01:37:53,460
That is power.
The mob is Rome.

846
01:37:53,502 --> 01:37:56,254
And while Commodus controls them,
he controls everything.

847
01:37:57,547 --> 01:37:59,508
Listen to me.

848
01:37:59,591 --> 01:38:02,803
My brother has enemies,
most of all in the senate.

849
01:38:02,844 --> 01:38:05,305
But while
the people follow him,

850
01:38:05,347 --> 01:38:08,475
no one would dare
stand up to him until you.

851
01:38:08,558 --> 01:38:11,561
They oppose him,
yet they do nothing.

852
01:38:11,645 --> 01:38:15,357
There are some politicians
who have dedicated their lives to Rome.

853
01:38:15,398 --> 01:38:18,109
One man above all.

854
01:38:18,193 --> 01:38:21,404
If I can arrange it,
will you meet him?

855
01:38:21,488 --> 01:38:23,740
Do you not understand?

856
01:38:23,824 --> 01:38:28,036
I may die in this cell tonight,
or in the arena tomorrow. I am a slave!

857
01:38:28,078 --> 01:38:30,539
What possible
difference can I make?

858
01:38:30,580 --> 01:38:33,208
This man wants
what you want.

859
01:38:33,250 --> 01:38:36,253
Then have him
kill Commodus!

860
01:38:38,171 --> 01:38:40,882
I knew a man once,

861
01:38:40,924 --> 01:38:44,302
a noble man,
a man of principle...

862
01:38:44,386 --> 01:38:47,097
who loved
my father.

863
01:38:47,180 --> 01:38:49,975
And my father
loved him.

864
01:38:51,101 --> 01:38:53,687
This man
served Rome well.

865
01:38:57,607 --> 01:38:59,860
That man is gone.

866
01:38:59,943 --> 01:39:02,195
Your brother
did his work well.

867
01:39:02,279 --> 01:39:04,698
Let me help you.

868
01:39:10,245 --> 01:39:13,957
Yes, you can help me.

869
01:39:16,626 --> 01:39:18,753
Forget you ever knew me...

870
01:39:18,837 --> 01:39:20,922
and never
come here again.

871
01:39:24,009 --> 01:39:27,429
Guard! The lady has finished with me.

872
01:39:55,040 --> 01:39:56,958
Maximus?

873
01:39:57,042 --> 01:40:00,712
You commanded legions?
You had many victories?

874
01:40:00,754 --> 01:40:03,757
- Yes.
- In Germania?

875
01:40:05,509 --> 01:40:08,094
In many countries.

876
01:40:09,179 --> 01:40:11,765
General.

877
01:40:59,271 --> 01:41:01,815
You have a great name.

878
01:41:01,898 --> 01:41:04,860
He must kill your name
before he kills you.

879
01:41:14,286 --> 01:41:16,246
Yes, at the far end.

880
01:41:16,288 --> 01:41:18,748
- Senator Gaius.
- Hello.

881
01:41:18,790 --> 01:41:20,750
Senator Gracchus.

882
01:41:22,294 --> 01:41:25,672
Don't often see you enjoying
the pleasures of the vulgar crowd.

883
01:41:25,755 --> 01:41:28,341
I don't pretend to be a man
of the people, Senator.

884
01:41:28,425 --> 01:41:31,511
But I do try to be a man
for the people.

885
01:41:45,484 --> 01:41:49,154
Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!

886
01:41:49,237 --> 01:41:51,198
Caesar! Caesar!

887
01:41:51,239 --> 01:41:54,993
Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!

888
01:41:57,204 --> 01:41:59,456
People of Rome!

889
01:42:01,541 --> 01:42:04,377
On the fourth day
of Antioch,

890
01:42:04,461 --> 01:42:08,381
we can celebrate
the 64th day of the games.

891
01:42:09,549 --> 01:42:14,471
And, in his
majestic charity,

892
01:42:14,554 --> 01:42:19,184
the Emperor has deigned this day
to favor the people of Rome...

893
01:42:19,267 --> 01:42:23,438
with an historical
final match.

894
01:42:23,522 --> 01:42:25,774
Returning to the Colosseum today...

895
01:42:25,857 --> 01:42:30,320
after five years
in retirement, Caesar...

896
01:42:30,403 --> 01:42:34,282
is pleased to bring you
the only...

897
01:42:34,324 --> 01:42:36,618
undefeated champion...

898
01:42:36,701 --> 01:42:39,120
- Yah! Yah!
-in Roman history,

899
01:42:39,204 --> 01:42:44,417
the legendary Tigris of Gaul!

900
01:42:59,516 --> 01:43:01,726
Whoa! Whoa!

901
01:43:05,522 --> 01:43:09,025
He knows too well
how to manipulate the mob.

902
01:43:09,109 --> 01:43:11,820
Marcus Aurelius had a dream
that was Rome, Proximo.

903
01:43:11,903 --> 01:43:14,364
This is not it!
This is not it!

904
01:43:14,406 --> 01:43:17,033
Marcus Aurelius is dead,
Maximus.

905
01:43:17,117 --> 01:43:20,328
We mortals are but
shadows and dust.

906
01:43:20,370 --> 01:43:23,790
- Shadows and dust, Maximus!

907
01:43:23,874 --> 01:43:27,210
Representing the training
lyceum of Antonius Proximo,

908
01:43:27,294 --> 01:43:31,131
Caesar is proud
to give you...

909
01:43:31,214 --> 01:43:34,509
Aelius Maximus!

910
01:43:40,599 --> 01:43:45,061
Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!

911
01:43:45,145 --> 01:43:47,898
Maximus! Maximus!

912
01:43:47,981 --> 01:43:50,233
They embrace him like
he's one of their own.

913
01:43:50,275 --> 01:43:53,987
The mob is fickle, brother.
He'll be forgotten in a month.

914
01:43:54,070 --> 01:43:56,907
Maximus! Maximus!

915
01:43:56,948 --> 01:43:59,993
No, much sooner
than that.

916
01:44:01,786 --> 01:44:04,331
It's been arranged.

917
01:44:10,045 --> 01:44:13,173
Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!

918
01:44:22,015 --> 01:44:24,726
We who are about to die salute you.

919
01:44:28,355 --> 01:44:30,899
We're with you, Maximus!

920
01:45:12,440 --> 01:45:15,193
Come on, finish it!

921
01:45:40,969 --> 01:45:43,555
- No!
- Pull! Pull!

922
01:45:57,319 --> 01:46:00,030
- Aah!

923
01:46:05,619 --> 01:46:07,496
Yeah!

924
01:46:16,755 --> 01:46:19,257
Loose! Loose!
Loose! Loose!

925
01:46:33,814 --> 01:46:36,858
Aah!

926
01:46:39,820 --> 01:46:42,447
Aah!

927
01:46:46,660 --> 01:46:48,537
Get him!
Kill him!

928
01:46:48,620 --> 01:46:52,124
Kill! Kill!
Kill! Kill!

929
01:46:52,207 --> 01:46:55,168
Kill! Kill!
Kill! Kill!

930
01:46:55,210 --> 01:46:58,296
Kill! Kill!
Kill! Kill!

931
01:46:58,380 --> 01:47:01,466
Kill! Kill!
Kill! Kill!

932
01:47:01,550 --> 01:47:04,553
Kill! Kill!
Kill! Kill!

933
01:47:04,636 --> 01:47:08,849
Kill! Kill!
Kill! Kill!

934
01:47:08,890 --> 01:47:11,893
Kill! Kill!
Kill! Kill!

935
01:47:11,935 --> 01:47:14,813
- Kill! Kill!
- Kill! Kill!

936
01:47:14,896 --> 01:47:17,399
- Kill!
- Kill!

937
01:47:17,482 --> 01:47:20,443
Kill! Kill!
Kill! Kill!

938
01:47:20,527 --> 01:47:24,573
Kill! Kill!
Kill! Kill!

939
01:47:24,656 --> 01:47:28,160
Kill! Kill!
Kill! Kill!

940
01:47:28,243 --> 01:47:31,913
Kill! Kill!
Kill! Kill!

941
01:47:31,997 --> 01:47:35,000
Kill! Kill!
Kill! Kill!

942
01:47:35,083 --> 01:47:38,795
Kill! Kill!
Kill! Kill!

943
01:47:52,684 --> 01:47:55,770
Maximus!
Maximus the Merciful!

944
01:47:55,854 --> 01:47:58,899
Maximus the Merciful!

945
01:48:03,445 --> 01:48:05,739
Maximus the Merciful!

946
01:48:05,822 --> 01:48:07,782
Maximus! Maximus!

947
01:48:07,824 --> 01:48:10,160
Maximus! Maximus!

948
01:48:10,202 --> 01:48:14,498
Maximus! Maximus!
Maximus!

949
01:48:14,539 --> 01:48:17,167
Maximus! Maximus!
Maximus!

950
01:48:17,375 --> 01:48:21,004
Forward, guards! On battery!

951
01:48:21,046 --> 01:48:23,048
Maximus! Maximus!

952
01:48:26,009 --> 01:48:29,596
Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!

953
01:48:29,679 --> 01:48:32,015
Maximus!
Maximus!

954
01:48:50,283 --> 01:48:54,621
What am I going
to do with you?

955
01:48:54,704 --> 01:48:57,290
You simply won't...

956
01:48:57,374 --> 01:48:59,292
die.

957
01:49:02,921 --> 01:49:06,299
Are we so different,
you and l?

958
01:49:06,341 --> 01:49:08,343
You take life
when you have to...

959
01:49:08,426 --> 01:49:10,428
as I do.

960
01:49:10,512 --> 01:49:14,558
I have only one more life to take.
Then it is done.

961
01:49:14,641 --> 01:49:16,935
Then take it now.

962
01:49:29,698 --> 01:49:32,325
They tell me your son...

963
01:49:32,367 --> 01:49:34,703
squealed like a girl...

964
01:49:34,786 --> 01:49:37,622
when they nailed him
to the cross.

965
01:49:37,706 --> 01:49:42,335
And your wife...
moaned like a whore...

966
01:49:44,463 --> 01:49:46,590
when they ravaged her...

967
01:49:46,673 --> 01:49:48,967
again and again...

968
01:49:50,343 --> 01:49:52,262
and again.

969
01:49:57,058 --> 01:50:00,729
The time for honoring yourself
will soon be at an end.

970
01:50:05,609 --> 01:50:07,736
Highness.

971
01:50:19,206 --> 01:50:23,251
Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!

972
01:50:23,293 --> 01:50:26,713
Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!

973
01:50:26,797 --> 01:50:31,760
Maximus! Maximus!
Maximus! Maximus!

974
01:50:33,762 --> 01:50:37,307
General! General!

975
01:50:37,390 --> 01:50:39,267
General!

976
01:50:39,351 --> 01:50:42,020
- General! General!
- Get back!

977
01:50:42,103 --> 01:50:44,606
- General!
- Cicero!

978
01:50:44,689 --> 01:50:47,651
Maximus! Maximus!

979
01:50:47,734 --> 01:50:49,945
- General!

980
01:50:50,028 --> 01:50:52,614
- General.
- Where are you camped?

981
01:50:52,697 --> 01:50:56,243
- Ostia.
- Maximus! Maximus!

982
01:50:56,326 --> 01:51:00,539
Maximus! Maximus!
Maximus! Maximus!

983
01:51:00,580 --> 01:51:03,416
- We love you, Maximus!
- Praise the victor!

984
01:51:03,500 --> 01:51:06,211
Tell the men their general lives.
Find me.

985
01:51:06,253 --> 01:51:09,381
- Move along!
- Find me!

986
01:51:09,464 --> 01:51:14,136
Maximus! Maximus!
Maximus! Maximus!

987
01:51:33,530 --> 01:51:35,949
Can they hear you?

988
01:51:38,994 --> 01:51:40,912
Who?

989
01:51:40,996 --> 01:51:43,999
Your family,
in the afterlife.

990
01:51:45,500 --> 01:51:47,919
- Oh, yes.
- What do you say to them?

991
01:51:51,840 --> 01:51:54,134
To my boy,

992
01:51:54,176 --> 01:51:56,428
I tell him I will
see him again soon.

993
01:51:56,511 --> 01:52:01,016
To keep his heels down
when he's riding his horse.

994
01:52:02,684 --> 01:52:04,603
To my wife-

995
01:52:06,521 --> 01:52:08,815
That is not
your business.

996
01:52:16,156 --> 01:52:19,201
And now they love Maximus
for his mercy.

997
01:52:20,744 --> 01:52:23,997
So I can't just kill him,
or it makes me even more unmerciful!

998
01:52:25,624 --> 01:52:30,045
The whole thing's
like some crazed nightmare.

999
01:52:31,087 --> 01:52:33,548
He is defying you.

1000
01:52:33,590 --> 01:52:36,593
His every victory
is an act of defiance.

1001
01:52:36,635 --> 01:52:40,722
The mob sees this,
and so do the senate.

1002
01:52:40,764 --> 01:52:45,227
Every day he lives,
they grow bolder.

1003
01:52:45,268 --> 01:52:47,395
- Kill him.
- No.

1004
01:52:48,980 --> 01:52:51,566
I will not make
a martyr of him.

1005
01:52:57,155 --> 01:52:59,324
I have been told...

1006
01:52:59,407 --> 01:53:01,326
of a certain sea snake...

1007
01:53:01,409 --> 01:53:05,747
which has a very unusual method
of attracting its prey.

1008
01:53:05,831 --> 01:53:10,502
It will lie at the bottom
of the ocean as if wounded.

1009
01:53:10,585 --> 01:53:12,838
Then its enemies
will approach,

1010
01:53:12,921 --> 01:53:15,841
and yet it will
lie quite still.

1011
01:53:15,924 --> 01:53:20,220
And then its enemies
will take little bites of it,

1012
01:53:20,303 --> 01:53:22,597
and yet it remains...

1013
01:53:22,681 --> 01:53:25,308
still.

1014
01:53:26,852 --> 01:53:29,146
So,

1015
01:53:29,229 --> 01:53:31,773
we will lie still...

1016
01:53:31,857 --> 01:53:35,402
and let our enemies
come to us and nibble.

1017
01:53:35,485 --> 01:53:38,905
Have every senator followed.

1018
01:53:51,960 --> 01:53:53,920
Maximus.

1019
01:53:55,464 --> 01:53:57,424
Cicero, my old friend.

1020
01:53:57,466 --> 01:53:59,509
I thought perhaps
I'd seen you for the last time.

1021
01:53:59,593 --> 01:54:01,845
- I thought you were dead.
- Close.

1022
01:54:01,928 --> 01:54:04,264
How long have the men
been in Ostia?

1023
01:54:04,347 --> 01:54:07,309
- All winter.
- And how do they look?

1024
01:54:07,392 --> 01:54:09,603
Fattened and bored.

1025
01:54:09,686 --> 01:54:11,646
Who's in command?

1026
01:54:11,688 --> 01:54:14,649
Some fool from Rome.

1027
01:54:14,691 --> 01:54:18,153
- How soon do you think they
could be ready to fight?
- For you, tomorrow.

1028
01:54:19,821 --> 01:54:22,449
I need you to
do something for me.

1029
01:54:26,787 --> 01:54:28,705
Come see. Witness.

1030
01:54:28,789 --> 01:54:31,625
If you haven't been in the arena,
you can see the show here.

1031
01:54:31,708 --> 01:54:36,171
Giant Maximus is defeating
our Emperor Commodus. What are we to do?

1032
01:54:36,254 --> 01:54:39,007
He's defying everyone.
What will we do?

1033
01:54:39,049 --> 01:54:41,802
- Ah! Look at that!

1034
01:54:41,885 --> 01:54:44,346
- Oh, he got him!

1035
01:54:44,387 --> 01:54:47,015
Give way! Give way!

1036
01:54:47,057 --> 01:54:49,184
Give way!

1037
01:54:51,061 --> 01:54:53,688
Three casks of red wine.

1038
01:54:53,772 --> 01:54:56,316
My lady?
I served your father at Vindobona.

1039
01:54:56,399 --> 01:54:58,318
-Back.
- Mylady.

1040
01:54:58,401 --> 01:55:00,362
I served your father
at Vindobona.

1041
01:55:00,445 --> 01:55:03,198
- Back!
- And I served the General Maximus.

1042
01:55:03,281 --> 01:55:05,534
I serve him still.

1043
01:55:05,617 --> 01:55:07,536
Stop.

1044
01:55:07,619 --> 01:55:09,746
- Stop.
-Stop!

1045
01:55:10,831 --> 01:55:13,083
Stand back.

1046
01:55:13,166 --> 01:55:15,919
The General sends word.
He will meet your politician.

1047
01:55:18,088 --> 01:55:22,259
- For your loyalty, soldier.
- Thank you, my lady.

1048
01:55:22,342 --> 01:55:24,719
Hup!

1049
01:55:31,143 --> 01:55:33,603
Leave us.

1050
01:55:38,233 --> 01:55:40,152
Senator Gracchus.

1051
01:55:53,707 --> 01:55:56,001
General.

1052
01:55:56,042 --> 01:56:00,088
I hope my coming here today
is evidence enough that...

1053
01:56:00,172 --> 01:56:02,090
you can trust me.

1054
01:56:05,844 --> 01:56:08,346
- The senate is with you?
- The senate?

1055
01:56:10,390 --> 01:56:13,685
Yes. I can speak for them.

1056
01:56:13,727 --> 01:56:17,230
You can buy my freedom
and smuggle me out of Rome?

1057
01:56:17,314 --> 01:56:20,233
To what end?

1058
01:56:20,275 --> 01:56:23,069
Get me outside
the city walls.

1059
01:56:23,111 --> 01:56:27,115
Have fresh horses ready to take me
to Ostia. My army's encamped there.

1060
01:56:27,199 --> 01:56:30,786
By nightfall of the second day,
I shall return at the head of 5,000 men.

1061
01:56:30,869 --> 01:56:34,414
But the legions all have new commanders
loyal to Commodus.

1062
01:56:34,498 --> 01:56:37,751
Let my men see me alive, and you
shall see where their loyalties lie.

1063
01:56:37,793 --> 01:56:39,920
This is madness.

1064
01:56:40,003 --> 01:56:43,465
- No Roman army has entered
the capital in a hundred years.
- Gracchus-

1065
01:56:43,507 --> 01:56:45,425
I will not trade
one dictatorship for another!

1066
01:56:45,467 --> 01:56:50,305
The time for half-measures
and talk is over, Senator.

1067
01:56:50,388 --> 01:56:53,892
And after your glorious coup,
what then?

1068
01:56:53,975 --> 01:56:57,437
You'll take your
5,000 warriors and leave?

1069
01:56:57,521 --> 01:56:59,856
I will leave.

1070
01:56:59,940 --> 01:57:03,652
The soldiers will stay
for your protection,
under the command of the senate.

1071
01:57:03,735 --> 01:57:07,113
So, once all
of Rome is yours,

1072
01:57:07,197 --> 01:57:10,158
you'll just give it
back to the people?

1073
01:57:10,242 --> 01:57:12,202
Tell me why.

1074
01:57:17,958 --> 01:57:20,418
Because that was the
last wish of a dying man.

1075
01:57:24,172 --> 01:57:26,091
I will kill Commodus.

1076
01:57:27,968 --> 01:57:31,429
The fate of Rome
I leave to you.

1077
01:57:32,931 --> 01:57:35,517
Marcus Aurelius trusted you.

1078
01:57:37,018 --> 01:57:39,437
His daughter trusts you.

1079
01:57:42,983 --> 01:57:45,068
I will trust you.

1080
01:57:45,152 --> 01:57:47,654
But we have little time.

1081
01:57:47,737 --> 01:57:49,823
Give me two days...

1082
01:57:49,906 --> 01:57:53,118
and I will buy your freedom.

1083
01:57:53,201 --> 01:57:55,954
And you-

1084
01:57:56,037 --> 01:57:58,790
You stay alive.

1085
01:57:58,874 --> 01:58:01,209
Or I'll be dead.

1086
01:58:02,419 --> 01:58:04,421
Now we must go.

1087
01:58:09,593 --> 01:58:12,012
It won't work.

1088
01:58:12,053 --> 01:58:15,140
The Emperor
knows too much.

1089
01:58:15,182 --> 01:58:17,184
And as for me,

1090
01:58:18,351 --> 01:58:21,521
it's becoming dangerous.

1091
01:58:21,605 --> 01:58:24,065
You will be paid
on my return.

1092
01:58:25,859 --> 01:58:27,986
- I give you my word.

1093
01:58:28,028 --> 01:58:30,739
Your word?
What if you don't return?

1094
01:58:30,822 --> 01:58:34,242
Do you remember what it was
to have trust, Proximo?

1095
01:58:34,326 --> 01:58:36,870
Trust?

1096
01:58:40,332 --> 01:58:42,250
Who am I to trust?

1097
01:58:42,334 --> 01:58:45,045
I will kill Commodus.

1098
01:58:45,086 --> 01:58:47,088
Why would I want that?

1099
01:58:47,172 --> 01:58:49,090
He makes me rich.

1100
01:58:51,676 --> 01:58:53,887
Oh, l-

1101
01:58:53,929 --> 01:58:57,224
I know that you are
a man of your word, General.

1102
01:58:58,600 --> 01:59:01,228
I know that you
would die for honor.

1103
01:59:02,729 --> 01:59:05,273
You would
die for Rome.

1104
01:59:05,357 --> 01:59:07,776
You would die for
the memory of your ancestors.

1105
01:59:07,859 --> 01:59:10,654
But l,
on the other hand-

1106
01:59:13,824 --> 01:59:15,742
I'm an entertainer.

1107
01:59:17,786 --> 01:59:20,205
Hmm? Guard!

1108
01:59:24,709 --> 01:59:27,170
He killed the man
who set you free.

1109
01:59:36,429 --> 01:59:38,849
Praetorians, master.

1110
01:59:44,896 --> 01:59:46,857
Halt!

1111
01:59:56,783 --> 01:59:58,869
Where have you been?

1112
01:59:58,952 --> 02:00:00,912
I sent for you.

1113
02:00:02,080 --> 02:00:04,040
Please, brother.

1114
02:00:08,587 --> 02:00:10,505
What's troubling you?

1115
02:00:13,758 --> 02:00:16,219
Does Gracchus
have a new lover?

1116
02:00:17,971 --> 02:00:19,890
I don't know.

1117
02:00:21,141 --> 02:00:23,059
I thought you'd seen him.

1118
02:00:24,478 --> 02:00:27,230
He infects everyone
like a putrid fever.

1119
02:00:28,482 --> 02:00:30,775
For the health of Rome,
the senate must be bled.

1120
02:00:32,277 --> 02:00:34,196
And he will bleed, too.

1121
02:00:34,279 --> 02:00:36,990
Very soon.

1122
02:00:38,200 --> 02:00:40,368
But not tonight.

1123
02:00:54,299 --> 02:00:56,718
Do you remember what
our father said once?

1124
02:00:58,970 --> 02:01:00,889
"It's a dream-

1125
02:01:02,724 --> 02:01:05,268
a frightful dream-

1126
02:01:07,187 --> 02:01:09,356
Life is."

1127
02:01:11,149 --> 02:01:13,401
Do you think that's true?

1128
02:01:13,485 --> 02:01:16,029
I don't know.

1129
02:01:18,990 --> 02:01:20,909
I think it is.

1130
02:01:23,453 --> 02:01:26,123
And I have only you
to share it with.

1131
02:02:03,910 --> 02:02:05,954
Open your mouth.

1132
02:02:42,282 --> 02:02:44,409
You know I love you.

1133
02:02:46,536 --> 02:02:48,789
And I love you.

1134
02:03:24,491 --> 02:03:26,910
Out. Get out!

1135
02:03:26,993 --> 02:03:29,371
Move!

1136
02:03:33,500 --> 02:03:35,544
Congratulations, General.

1137
02:03:35,627 --> 02:03:39,089
You've got very...
persuasive friends.

1138
02:03:44,427 --> 02:03:46,930
My brother's had
Gracchus arrested.

1139
02:03:47,013 --> 02:03:51,017
We daren't wait any longer.
We must leave tonight.

1140
02:03:51,101 --> 02:03:54,813
Proximo will come at midnight
and take you to the gate.

1141
02:03:54,896 --> 02:03:57,691
Your servant, Cicero,
will be waiting there with horses.

1142
02:04:00,443 --> 02:04:02,404
You have done all this?

1143
02:04:02,445 --> 02:04:05,323
- Yes.
- You risk too much.

1144
02:04:06,741 --> 02:04:09,161
I have much to pay for.

1145
02:04:10,912 --> 02:04:12,831
You have nothing to pay for.

1146
02:04:12,914 --> 02:04:16,501
You love your son.
You're strong for him.

1147
02:04:19,671 --> 02:04:23,383
I am tired of being strong.

1148
02:04:23,467 --> 02:04:26,219
My brother hates all the world,

1149
02:04:26,303 --> 02:04:28,221
and you most of all.

1150
02:04:28,305 --> 02:04:32,184
- Because your father chose me.
- No.

1151
02:04:33,268 --> 02:04:35,812
Because my father loved you.

1152
02:04:39,357 --> 02:04:42,194
And because I loved you.

1153
02:04:44,362 --> 02:04:46,323
A long time ago.

1154
02:04:50,410 --> 02:04:52,704
Was I very different then?

1155
02:04:59,419 --> 02:05:01,338
You laughed more.

1156
02:05:05,258 --> 02:05:08,887
I have felt alone
all my life,

1157
02:05:08,970 --> 02:05:11,056
except with you.

1158
02:05:13,767 --> 02:05:15,685
I must go.

1159
02:05:15,769 --> 02:05:18,355
Yes.

1160
02:05:44,965 --> 02:05:47,092
There. There.

1161
02:05:47,175 --> 02:05:50,595
- There. There. There.
There. There. There.

1162
02:05:50,679 --> 02:05:52,806
There. There. There.

1163
02:05:52,889 --> 02:05:54,975
There. There. There.

1164
02:05:55,058 --> 02:05:57,561
- There. There. There. There.

1165
02:05:57,644 --> 02:05:59,563
And I've got you.

1166
02:06:02,232 --> 02:06:04,693
Isn't it late
to be playing legionnaire?

1167
02:06:04,734 --> 02:06:07,112
I'm not a legionnaire.

1168
02:06:07,195 --> 02:06:09,364
- Not a legionnaire?
- I'm a gladiator.

1169
02:06:10,949 --> 02:06:14,828
A gladiator?
Gladiators only fight in the games.

1170
02:06:14,911 --> 02:06:16,997
Wouldn't you rather be...

1171
02:06:17,080 --> 02:06:19,249
a great Roman warrior
like Julius Caesar?

1172
02:06:19,332 --> 02:06:22,419
I'm Maximus,
the savior of Rome!

1173
02:06:24,045 --> 02:06:26,381
The savior of Rome?

1174
02:06:34,723 --> 02:06:36,641
And who said that?

1175
02:06:45,233 --> 02:06:47,652
Where's Lucius?

1176
02:06:47,694 --> 02:06:49,654
He's with the Emperor, my lady.

1177
02:06:53,492 --> 02:06:56,536
-She couldn't.
- Yes, she did.

1178
02:06:56,620 --> 02:07:00,207
She took it from a basket
and pressed it to her breast,

1179
02:07:00,290 --> 02:07:02,209
right here
above her heart.

1180
02:07:04,336 --> 02:07:06,588
It bit her in the breast?

1181
02:07:06,671 --> 02:07:08,590
Yes.

1182
02:07:08,673 --> 02:07:11,718
You see, Lucius,
sometimes royal ladies...

1183
02:07:11,802 --> 02:07:15,597
behave very strangely and do
very odd things in the name of love.

1184
02:07:15,680 --> 02:07:17,599
I think it's silly.

1185
02:07:17,682 --> 02:07:19,601
So do l.

1186
02:07:21,102 --> 02:07:23,063
So do l.

1187
02:07:23,104 --> 02:07:25,273
Sister, join us.

1188
02:07:25,357 --> 02:07:27,567
I've been reading
to dear Lucius.

1189
02:07:27,651 --> 02:07:30,362
- I've been reading too.
- Yes.

1190
02:07:30,403 --> 02:07:32,364
He's a very clever
little boy.

1191
02:07:32,405 --> 02:07:35,534
He'll make a grand
emperor one day.

1192
02:07:35,575 --> 02:07:39,287
We've been reading about the great
Mark Antony and his adventures in Egypt.

1193
02:07:39,371 --> 02:07:41,456
The queen killed herself
with a snake.

1194
02:07:41,540 --> 02:07:44,751
And just wait until you hear what
happened to our ancestors.

1195
02:07:44,835 --> 02:07:47,337
If you're very good,

1196
02:07:47,420 --> 02:07:51,466
tomorrow night I'll tell you
the story of Emperor Claudius.

1197
02:07:51,550 --> 02:07:54,261
He was betrayed...

1198
02:07:54,344 --> 02:07:56,596
by those closest to him.

1199
02:07:57,973 --> 02:07:59,891
By his own blood.

1200
02:08:01,476 --> 02:08:03,979
They whispered in dark corners...

1201
02:08:04,020 --> 02:08:05,981
and went out
late at night...

1202
02:08:06,022 --> 02:08:08,692
and conspired...

1203
02:08:08,775 --> 02:08:10,777
and conspired.

1204
02:08:12,320 --> 02:08:15,282
But the Emperor Claudius
knew that they were up to something.

1205
02:08:16,491 --> 02:08:18,827
He knew they were
busy little bees.

1206
02:08:20,871 --> 02:08:24,624
And one night he sat down
with one of them...

1207
02:08:24,708 --> 02:08:27,252
and he looked at her...

1208
02:08:27,335 --> 02:08:29,254
and he said,

1209
02:08:30,338 --> 02:08:33,508
"Tell me what you've been doing,

1210
02:08:33,550 --> 02:08:35,510
busy little bee,

1211
02:08:37,554 --> 02:08:40,807
or I shall strike down
those dearest to you.

1212
02:08:40,891 --> 02:08:45,312
You shall watch
as I bathe in their blood. "

1213
02:08:48,231 --> 02:08:51,026
And the Emperor
was heartbroken.

1214
02:08:52,944 --> 02:08:55,405
The little bee had
wounded him more deeply...

1215
02:08:55,447 --> 02:08:58,617
than anyone else
could ever have done.

1216
02:09:00,035 --> 02:09:03,955
And what do you think
happened then, Lucius?

1217
02:09:04,039 --> 02:09:06,458
I don't know, Uncle.

1218
02:09:12,047 --> 02:09:14,299
The little bee
told him everything.

1219
02:09:54,005 --> 02:09:57,634
Open, in the name of the Emperor!

1220
02:09:57,717 --> 02:09:59,636
Proximo!

1221
02:09:59,719 --> 02:10:03,181
Open the gates in the name
of the Emperor!

1222
02:10:03,265 --> 02:10:06,101
- Proximo!

1223
02:10:06,184 --> 02:10:08,812
Open the gates!

1224
02:10:14,651 --> 02:10:17,404
Open the gates, Proximo!

1225
02:10:17,446 --> 02:10:20,574
Do you want to die, old man?

1226
02:10:20,615 --> 02:10:22,909
Here.

1227
02:10:22,993 --> 02:10:25,287
Everything is prepared.

1228
02:10:25,370 --> 02:10:28,290
- It seems you've won your freedom.
- Proximo,

1229
02:10:28,373 --> 02:10:31,001
are you in danger
of becoming a good man?

1230
02:10:31,084 --> 02:10:32,752
Ha!

1231
02:10:36,047 --> 02:10:39,926
-Juba.
- All enemies of the Emperor die!

1232
02:10:40,010 --> 02:10:44,264
Open the gates!
The Emperor commands!

1233
02:10:48,101 --> 02:10:50,312
Pull!

1234
02:10:52,272 --> 02:10:55,275
Move! Two columns on the left!

1235
02:10:58,403 --> 02:11:01,198
I only need moments,
so do not be careless with your lives.

1236
02:11:01,281 --> 02:11:04,701
If you don't want any part of this,
go back to your cells.

1237
02:11:04,785 --> 02:11:06,703
We'll wait here for you,
Maximus.

1238
02:11:06,787 --> 02:11:09,664
- Strength and honor.
- Go!

1239
02:11:10,791 --> 02:11:13,710
Strength and honor.

1240
02:11:14,920 --> 02:11:18,465
Aim! Break the bars!

1241
02:12:24,698 --> 02:12:26,658
Shadows and dust.

1242
02:12:26,741 --> 02:12:28,785
Aah!

1243
02:13:07,115 --> 02:13:09,451
- Maximus!

1244
02:13:14,122 --> 02:13:16,166
I'm sorry.

1245
02:13:16,249 --> 02:13:18,543
No!

1246
02:13:42,818 --> 02:13:44,736
It's done.

1247
02:13:51,409 --> 02:13:53,912
And what of my nephew?

1248
02:13:53,954 --> 02:13:56,414
And what of his mother?

1249
02:13:58,291 --> 02:14:01,044
Should they share
her lover's fate?

1250
02:14:02,671 --> 02:14:05,132
Or should
I be merciful?

1251
02:14:07,425 --> 02:14:09,845
Commodus the Merciful.

1252
02:14:15,892 --> 02:14:19,062
Lucius will stay with me now.

1253
02:14:19,146 --> 02:14:22,357
And if his mother...

1254
02:14:22,440 --> 02:14:25,819
so much as looks at me...

1255
02:14:25,902 --> 02:14:28,864
in a manner that displeases me,

1256
02:14:30,157 --> 02:14:32,117
he will die.

1257
02:14:35,245 --> 02:14:37,497
If she decides...

1258
02:14:37,539 --> 02:14:40,125
to be noble...

1259
02:14:40,208 --> 02:14:43,753
and takes her own life,

1260
02:14:43,837 --> 02:14:45,755
he will die.

1261
02:14:48,550 --> 02:14:50,469
And as for you,

1262
02:14:53,346 --> 02:14:55,932
you will love me...

1263
02:14:56,016 --> 02:14:58,143
as I loved you.

1264
02:14:59,394 --> 02:15:01,855
You will provide me
with an heir...

1265
02:15:01,897 --> 02:15:04,191
of pure blood...

1266
02:15:04,232 --> 02:15:07,235
so that Commodus
and his progeny...

1267
02:15:07,277 --> 02:15:09,738
will rule for
a thousand years.

1268
02:15:13,867 --> 02:15:16,328
Am I not merciful?

1269
02:15:37,641 --> 02:15:40,060
Am I not merciful?

1270
02:15:52,280 --> 02:15:54,407
Maximus! Maximus!

1271
02:15:54,491 --> 02:15:57,327
Maximus! Maximus!
Maximus!

1272
02:15:57,369 --> 02:16:00,163
Maximus! Maximus!

1273
02:16:00,247 --> 02:16:02,499
Maximus! Maximus!

1274
02:16:02,582 --> 02:16:04,668
Maximus! Maximus!

1275
02:16:04,709 --> 02:16:08,672
Maximus! Maximus!
Maximus! Maximus!

1276
02:16:08,713 --> 02:16:11,675
Maximus! Maximus!

1277
02:16:11,716 --> 02:16:14,427
Maximus! Maximus!

1278
02:16:14,511 --> 02:16:17,055
Maximus! Maximus!

1279
02:16:17,139 --> 02:16:19,057
Maximus! Maximus!

1280
02:16:19,141 --> 02:16:21,518
Maximus! Maximus!

1281
02:16:21,560 --> 02:16:23,770
Maximus! Maximus!

1282
02:16:23,854 --> 02:16:27,107
Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!

1283
02:16:27,190 --> 02:16:30,193
Maximus! Maximus!

1284
02:16:30,277 --> 02:16:32,571
Maximus! Maximus!

1285
02:16:36,992 --> 02:16:39,161
Maximus.

1286
02:16:39,244 --> 02:16:41,413
Maximus.

1287
02:16:41,496 --> 02:16:43,457
Maximus.

1288
02:16:44,666 --> 02:16:46,751
They call for you.

1289
02:16:48,378 --> 02:16:52,132
The general
who became a slave.

1290
02:16:52,215 --> 02:16:55,469
The slave
who became a gladiator.

1291
02:16:56,720 --> 02:16:59,848
The gladiator
who defied an emperor.

1292
02:17:01,516 --> 02:17:04,144
A striking story.

1293
02:17:04,227 --> 02:17:07,189
Now the people want to know
how the story ends.

1294
02:17:09,691 --> 02:17:11,943
Only a famous death will do.

1295
02:17:13,528 --> 02:17:16,490
And what could be
more glorious...

1296
02:17:16,531 --> 02:17:20,494
than to challenge the Emperor
himself in the great arena?

1297
02:17:22,871 --> 02:17:25,165
You would fight me?

1298
02:17:25,207 --> 02:17:28,919
Why not?
Do you think I'm afraid?

1299
02:17:30,128 --> 02:17:32,923
I think you have been afraid
all your life.

1300
02:17:33,006 --> 02:17:37,135
Unlike Maximus the Invincible,
who knows no fear?

1301
02:17:42,766 --> 02:17:47,062
I knew a man who once said,
" Death smiles at us all.

1302
02:17:47,103 --> 02:17:50,273
All a man can do
is smile back."

1303
02:17:50,357 --> 02:17:53,026
I wonder.

1304
02:17:53,110 --> 02:17:55,529
Did your friend
smile at his own death?

1305
02:17:56,613 --> 02:17:58,532
You must know.

1306
02:18:00,951 --> 02:18:03,286
He was your father.

1307
02:18:06,623 --> 02:18:10,293
You loved my father,
I know.

1308
02:18:10,377 --> 02:18:12,295
But so did l.

1309
02:18:13,380 --> 02:18:15,590
That makes us brothers,
doesn't it?

1310
02:18:17,843 --> 02:18:20,679
Smile for me now, brother.

1311
02:18:24,516 --> 02:18:27,227
- Strap on his armor.

1312
02:18:27,310 --> 02:18:30,021
Conceal the wound.

1313
02:18:35,777 --> 02:18:37,529
Maximus! Maximus!

1314
02:18:37,612 --> 02:18:40,365
Maximus! Maximus!

1315
02:19:22,741 --> 02:19:24,743
Ring formation!

1316
02:19:24,826 --> 02:19:27,621
Ring formation!

1317
02:19:57,150 --> 02:20:00,320
Off with his head, Maximus!

1318
02:21:04,509 --> 02:21:08,180
- Aah!

1319
02:21:15,770 --> 02:21:17,939
Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!

1320
02:21:18,023 --> 02:21:20,400
Quintus, sword!

1321
02:21:20,442 --> 02:21:23,236
Give me your sword!

1322
02:21:25,238 --> 02:21:27,783
Sword! Give me a sword!

1323
02:21:27,866 --> 02:21:30,660
- Sheathe your swords!

1324
02:21:30,744 --> 02:21:33,747
Sheathe yours words!

1325
02:23:48,340 --> 02:23:50,258
Maximus.

1326
02:23:54,304 --> 02:23:57,808
- Maximus.
- Quintus.

1327
02:23:59,726 --> 02:24:02,646
Free my men.

1328
02:24:02,729 --> 02:24:05,273
Senator Gracchus
is to be reinstated.

1329
02:24:06,358 --> 02:24:08,360
There was a dream
that was Rome.

1330
02:24:09,611 --> 02:24:12,239
It shall be realized.

1331
02:24:12,322 --> 02:24:14,866
These are the wishes
of Marcus Aurelius.

1332
02:24:14,950 --> 02:24:17,869
Free the prisoners!
Go!

1333
02:24:41,810 --> 02:24:43,728
Maximus!

1334
02:24:45,605 --> 02:24:47,899
Lucius is safe.

1335
02:25:03,415 --> 02:25:05,500
Go to them.

1336
02:25:53,673 --> 02:25:56,134
You're home.

1337
02:26:22,202 --> 02:26:25,622
Is Rome worth
one good man's life?

1338
02:26:29,251 --> 02:26:31,503
We believed it once.

1339
02:26:33,588 --> 02:26:35,549
Make us
believe it again.

1340
02:26:39,928 --> 02:26:42,389
He was a soldier of Rome.

1341
02:26:45,809 --> 02:26:48,145
Honor him.

1342
02:26:48,228 --> 02:26:50,647
Who will help me carry him?

1343
02:27:34,608 --> 02:27:37,068
Now we are free.

1344
02:27:42,574 --> 02:27:45,160
I will see you again.

1345
02:27:47,287 --> 02:27:49,873
But not yet.

1346
02:27:49,915 --> 02:27:51,875
Not yet.
