00:00:46,011 --> 00:00:51,089
base 27-33.

4
00:00:52,971 --> 00:00:54,667
Our mission is to seek and destroy.

5
00:00:56,589 --> 00:00:59,056
Our enemies are not.

6
00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:04,205
Lethal weapons are ours.

7
00:01:05,322 --> 00:01:08,763
They have knowledge of
soft targets in the

8
00:01:08,764 --> 00:01:12,203
basement and that makes
them difficult to destroy.

9
00:01:13,533 --> 00:01:17,008
We are allowed to shoot our goal.

10
00:01:18,613 --> 00:01:22,647
There will be no mercy for any of us.

11
00:03:42,064 --> 00:03:43,794
Dude, is it?

12
00:03:46,411 --> 00:03:48,428

A taste, man!

17
00:04:04,329 --> 00:04:05,953

00:04:07,044 --> 00:04:09,297
She is Jenna and she Evie.

19
00:04:11,324 --> 00:04:13,470
We all grew up with Max.

20
00:04:14,559 --> 00:04:19,078
What a great view, good is to return.

21
00:04:20,473 --> 00:04:25,479
Buy some drinks!

22
00:04:27,084 --> 00:04:28,152
Come on baby.

23
00:04:43,227 --> 00:04:44,259
Well, Jenna!

24
00:04:51,995 --> 00:04:53,311
It is time for some shots!

25
00:04:55,509 --> 00:04:56,446
Here we go.

26

Health!

27
00:05:00,068 --> 00:05:01,243
Health.

28
00:05:04,939 --> 00:05:08,094
How were things?
I heard there were problems.

29
00:05:08,869 --> 00:05:10,222
He met a sexy doctor.

30
00:05:10,262 --> 00:05:14,604
Really? And I can not or Cosmetelogía.

31
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:19,407
Travel the world and returns
with the girl, incredible.

32
00:05:19,447 --> 00:05:23,610
She must be good and intelligent Dr.

33

Do not be jealous, come.

34
00:05:59,668 --> 00:06:02,692
'Hello!
'Hi, Eric!

35
00:06:02,728 --> 00:06:04,318

Oh my god!
...I missed you so much!

39
00:06:25,379 --> 00:06:26,933
Is it .. Dr.?

40
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:30,005
Evie, Jenna, she's my girlfriend Look.

41
00:06:30,042 --> 00:06:34,110
Hello
...Our boy won the prize.

42
00:06:34,147 --> 00:06:36,543
'I'm Eric

00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:39,537
I have a memory to show.

44
00:06:41,488 --> 00:06:42,876
It looks sexy, no?

45
00:06:42,915 --> 00:06:47,019
You look good for women
...Hey, I'm a real man, real man!

Have fun!

47
00:07:15,549 --> 00:07:19,998
Perfect I do not like these places.

48
00:07:23,517 --> 00:07:24,417
Will be an adventure.

49
00:07:26,684 --> 00:07:28,902
Well, do it fast.

50
00:08:37,382 --> 00:08:38,841
Sorry, big guy.

51
00:09:40,356 --> 00:09:41,525
What the hell's the matter?

52
00:09:42,827 --> 00:09:45,081
Reviewing my dog??,
What are you doing, man?

53
00:09:45,124 --> 00:09:46,855
Fuck you!

54
00:09:51,907 --> 00:09:53,010
Want some cowboy?

55
00:09:57,231 --> 00:09:58,476
You are nothing.

56
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,461
Stay away, bitch.

57
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:07,941
Come for a little bitch.

58
00:10:20,054 --> 00:10:21,123
Go!

59
00:10:25,344 --> 00:10:26,732
I will cut like a fish.

60
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,626
Stand down, soldier

61
00:10:46,915 --> 00:10:48,646
I'm.

62
00:10:48,688 --> 00:10:51,227
Saved by the Bell, bitch.

63
00:11:03,615 --> 00:11:05,727
Storm, bitches.

64
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,400
Come on, come on!

65
00:11:26,509 --> 00:11:27,897
At the door, fast!

66
00:11:32,354 --> 00:11:33,290
Quick, hurry!

67
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:03,729
They were.

68
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:07,555
They shot the door, Billy.

69
00:12:07,599 --> 00:12:09,222
What the hell?

70
00:12:15,219 --> 00:12:16,500
What the hell are you doing?

71
00:12:19,149 --> 00:12:20,502
Oh shit.

72
00:12:20,542 --> 00:12:24,089
Shot?
Yes, there are thugs out.

73
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:27,115
They have weapons
...What? Open the door!

74
00:12:27,153 --> 00:12:29,133
Shut up 'You shut up.

75
00:12:35,329 --> 00:12:36,433
What did you say?

76
00:12:36,477 --> 00:12:39,050
Do not you hear me?

77
00:12:46,706 --> 00:12:49,172
Hey, hey.

78
00:12:53,491 --> 00:12:54,629
Depart.

79
00:12:59,544 --> 00:13:04,195
You do not know you, but relax.

80
00:13:05,633 --> 00:13:09,595
All relax
I can not, I'm claustrophobic.

81
00:13:09,634 --> 00:13:11,816
And why did you come?
...Do not be stupid.

82
00:13:11,861 --> 00:13:13,771
Come.

83
00:13:18,053 --> 00:13:20,627
Help, Help!
...Closed doors!

84
00:13:23,065 --> 00:13:26,778
Guys, the music stopped, the
party ended, No one comes to us.

85
00:13:28,177 --> 00:13:32,520
How we get out?

86
00:13:34,372 --> 00:13:40,456
It is made of concrete... and metal

87
00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:42,333
shit.

88
00:13:44,287 --> 00:13:46,470
It is an industrial cave.

89
00:13:46,515 --> 00:13:50,404
Typical underground U.S. military.

90
00:13:51,593 --> 00:13:56,150
All these places are the same.

91
00:13:57,612 --> 00:14:02,893
Have drivers, radiators,
a second exhaust port

92
00:14:02,937 --> 00:14:08,535
and those fans used to escape.

93
00:14:08,572 --> 00:14:12,463
If I get a radiator,
I can recharge my cell.

94
00:14:12,505 --> 00:14:15,078
How are you going to have
an underground service?

95
00:14:15,114 --> 00:14:18,233
Well, where is the second exit, genius?

96
00:14:29,101 --> 00:14:31,177
There's something wrong with this place.

97
00:14:35,815 --> 00:14:39,456
'This way there should be a door
'Sorry, I will not go more.

98
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:41,377
The exit is over there.

99
00:14:41,416 --> 00:14:44,121
It is the only path to an exit.

100
00:14:59,196 --> 00:15:06,196
Preserve light, with cell phones and
the glosticks when necessary.

101
00:15:11,965 --> 00:15:13,174
We must leave here.

102
00:15:34,719 --> 00:15:35,656
Idiot!

103
00:15:35,694 --> 00:15:37,946
Do not make jokes, Storm.

104
00:15:43,417 --> 00:15:45,470
Storm, come here

105
00:15:45,506 --> 00:15:47,830
Eric, turns on the light.

106
00:15:51,245 --> 00:15:53,083
Shit...
...What is it?

107
00:15:53,124 --> 00:15:57,987
Here are gas lamps,
used it in an emergency.

108
00:16:04,432 --> 00:16:06,578
Pull this 'All right, boss.

109
00:16:14,731 --> 00:16:16,675
Oh god, I could kiss!

110
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:21,236
Do not get excited, do not
know how much gas has.

111
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:25,092
You're right, let's use this light,
let's go.

112
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,701
Come on, move!

113
00:16:38,424 --> 00:16:40,297
Left.

114
00:16:52,445 --> 00:16:54,070
What the hell was that?
Oh my god.

115
00:16:55,646 --> 00:16:57,414
Hurry
...I will not go over there.

116
00:16:57,456 --> 00:16:59,709
Can be stopped?

117
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:04,545
They think they have a GPS?
That is the wrong way.

118
00:17:05,701 --> 00:17:07,469
Let's face.

119
00:17:10,015 --> 00:17:17,015
Relax, this place is easy to confuse.

120
00:17:17,426 --> 00:17:20,937
No big deal, is what is happening now.

121
00:17:23,968 --> 00:17:27,680
The second output should
be opposite to the first.

122
00:17:29,047 --> 00:17:32,203
We are still at the first exit,
come on, think a little.

123
00:17:33,606 --> 00:17:35,752
Come, come.

124
00:17:38,232 --> 00:17:41,187
Why did I come?
It's your fault!

125
00:17:41,225 --> 00:17:43,621
Shut up!
We are going to die!

126
00:17:43,661 --> 00:17:48,523
They shut up and walk.

127
00:18:05,509 --> 00:18:08,665
My God... This leads to
another level, the only way out.

128
00:18:08,711 --> 00:18:12,875
We will divide into 2 groups
takes the girls with you, Billy

129
00:18:12,921 --> 00:18:15,553
I'll be behind you, quiet

130
00:18:18,731 --> 00:18:22,172
I do not know how safe they are,
we should not use together.

131
00:19:05,213 --> 00:19:08,962
It's just down ..
Everything all right?

132
00:19:09,006 --> 00:19:13,728
Let us find the damn exit.

133
00:19:18,818 --> 00:19:20,621
That is disgusting.

134
00:19:50,374 --> 00:19:53,400
Great, no output.

135
00:19:56,707 --> 00:19:58,296
Check this out.

136
00:20:00,812 --> 00:20:02,129
What is it?

137
00:20:06,067 --> 00:20:07,620
One type of tunnel

138
00:20:12,156 --> 00:20:13,708
I will review

139
00:20:29,447 --> 00:20:30,763
I saw something, I swear to God

140
00:20:30,803 --> 00:20:32,856
I saw eyes.

141
00:20:32,892 --> 00:20:34,835
You say that there is something there?
Yes.

142
00:20:34,874 --> 00:20:37,935
What could have down here?
...Hey!

143
00:20:46,322 --> 00:20:49,418
What do you do with scare?
...I just saw your eyes, man.

144
00:20:50,914 --> 00:20:53,130
Lie, go see it again.

145
00:21:31,691 --> 00:21:33,671
Yes, nothing.

146
00:21:34,996 --> 00:21:36,941
It must be reflective, I was wrong

147
00:21:39,554 --> 00:21:45,983
I saw that there is a way, maybe if we,
we reach the second level

148
00:21:46,025 --> 00:21:49,774
I will not go there
...We also.

149
00:21:50,792 --> 00:21:53,009
Look for a door.

150
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:07,595
There.

151
00:22:07,632 --> 00:22:11,974
If someone wants to do it, do it now
'That will be me.

152
00:22:16,921 --> 00:22:19,139
Meanwhile, go over there

153
00:22:25,932 --> 00:22:28,400
I have very thirsty Yes, I also.

154
00:22:42,284 --> 00:22:43,743
What, what was that?

155
00:22:43,781 --> 00:22:45,781
Only the tubes.

156
00:22:56,236 --> 00:22:58,420
Is glass?

157
00:23:02,394 --> 00:23:04,721
For what?

158
00:23:07,474 --> 00:23:08,862
Give me the pole.

159
00:23:17,739 --> 00:23:20,444
Sounds like a old aquarium
I can not see anything.

160
00:23:24,802 --> 00:23:28,276
And they are in a contest to urinate?
Why is taking so long?

161
00:23:32,455 --> 00:23:33,808
We.

162
00:23:34,822 --> 00:23:38,820
Hey, you can take water
from the urinary.

163
00:23:40,459 --> 00:23:43,720
You are sick.
Have fun.

164
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:04,531
What the fuck!

165
00:24:27,324 --> 00:24:28,984
My God, my God!

166
00:24:29,029 --> 00:24:32,326
What the hell happened?

167
00:24:32,368 --> 00:24:35,144
We do not know, do not know!

168
00:24:35,187 --> 00:24:37,240
Jenna!

169
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:45,375
Just steer clear, okay?

170
00:24:45,416 --> 00:24:48,121
Is breathing.

171
00:24:55,227 --> 00:24:56,402
You'll be fine.

172
00:24:56,445 --> 00:24:59,542
There's nothing there Click, right?

173
00:24:59,577 --> 00:25:02,114
Jenna, Evie!

174
00:25:02,151 --> 00:25:05,935
Where were they?
I do not know, but we must leave here.

175
00:25:19,235 --> 00:25:23,268
Not far from us We are going to die.

176
00:25:37,778 --> 00:25:40,968
It's going to survive?
Yes, still breathing.

177
00:25:41,014 --> 00:25:43,825
And if we find a way out...

178
00:25:51,034 --> 00:25:54,961
We can not take it, we will stop,
need speed

179
00:25:56,358 --> 00:25:58,790
I think it'll be fine.
You'll be fine.

180
00:25:58,828 --> 00:26:01,188
Both must be calm.

181
00:26:02,656 --> 00:26:06,583
Yes, listen to Dr. He did not even
know what it was that attacked him.

182
00:26:06,622 --> 00:26:11,556
These gang... did
They?

183
00:26:11,597 --> 00:26:13,649
You think they were?

184
00:26:13,684 --> 00:26:15,938
Eric, not.

185
00:26:16,781 --> 00:26:19,380
Come a time.

186
00:26:25,341 --> 00:26:27,914
We have to think a strategy now.

187
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:31,804
'We have to be quiet
How are we to do?

188
00:26:31,846 --> 00:26:35,286
- Because we're going to die!
- Shut up, shut up!

189
00:26:35,326 --> 00:26:37,165
Shut all.

190
00:26:37,166 --> 00:26:39,004
We need help now or
will bleed to death.

191
00:26:40,997 --> 00:26:44,437
We have to divide us.
Someone must stay with him

192
00:26:44,476 --> 00:26:47,631
I'll go with you.

193
00:26:52,443 --> 00:26:54,910
'All right, all right According

194
00:26:56,236 --> 00:27:00,469
God is vomiting blood!

195
00:27:17,494 --> 00:27:22,050
Where are we going?
What the hell was that?

196
00:27:47,312 --> 00:27:48,284
Let's go.

197
00:27:54,096 --> 00:27:56,457
We're gonna die! We're gonna die!

198
00:28:07,317 --> 00:28:09,914
See that? It was not human!
'I do not know!

199
00:28:11,492 --> 00:28:15,098
Who did you think human?

200
00:28:15,146 --> 00:28:18,964
I have seen so many bodies in Iraq.

201
00:28:21,861 --> 00:28:24,186
By bombs, but no hands!

202
00:28:26,976 --> 00:28:29,477
Pick it up, do it.

203
00:28:31,324 --> 00:28:33,340
You can do
...No, I can!

204
00:28:34,386 --> 00:28:36,386
Okay, okay.

205
00:28:44,824 --> 00:28:46,378
Okay, okay.

206
00:28:50,947 --> 00:28:53,023
We're not alone 'I know.

207
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:56,368
No, look at that.

208
00:28:56,410 --> 00:28:59,220
What do they do?

209
00:28:59,262 --> 00:29:01,030
Without departing from the group.

210
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,496
What the hell is that?

211
00:29:18,711 --> 00:29:20,099
Definitely not human.

212
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:24,382
We do not know how much
gas is in the generators.

213
00:29:24,383 --> 00:29:26,434
We have to keep moving.

214
00:29:26,471 --> 00:29:31,121
The more we know what it is,
better to fight them.

215
00:29:34,265 --> 00:29:38,570
He's dead, whatever it is,
That is not breathing.

216
00:29:41,362 --> 00:29:43,414
This is not something
you've seen before.

217
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:57,598
You can not break the glass, go, go!

218
00:30:47,225 --> 00:30:51,222
What the hell is it?
...No time to find out! Come on!

219
00:31:13,736 --> 00:31:16,477
We can still way out hajar.

220
00:31:39,552 --> 00:31:41,046
It is clear.

221
00:31:41,082 --> 00:31:44,688
'It's a good place to hide
'Come, come.

222
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:47,096
Come on!

223
00:31:49,016 --> 00:31:52,943
Look what is necessary for
use as weapons, whatever.

224
00:31:52,983 --> 00:31:57,216
They must do whatever
is necessary to defend.

225
00:31:59,001 --> 00:32:01,812
Whatever you have to do, they will.

226
00:32:14,728 --> 00:32:18,891
Water, food, whatever they are.

227
00:32:18,972 --> 00:32:21,404
Are we ready?
Go!

228
00:32:55,157 --> 00:32:58,703
The generators ran out of gas,
Eric catches that

229
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:00,852
I can not see anything.

230
00:33:00,896 --> 00:33:04,123
The light works?

231
00:33:27,234 --> 00:33:28,789
Are upon us.

232
00:33:28,836 --> 00:33:33,557
Quick!

233
00:33:33,602 --> 00:33:36,377
Shit!

234
00:34:00,706 --> 00:34:03,968
I'm coming!

235
00:34:59,991 --> 00:35:01,237
Calm down.

236
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:04,162
It is not.

237
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:10,073
Silence.

238
00:35:26,399 --> 00:35:28,308
You should not have come for me.

239
00:35:28,347 --> 00:35:31,504
We are one, remember?

240
00:35:31,549 --> 00:35:33,388
You out of here.

241
00:37:04,653 --> 00:37:06,385
Let's see if it works.

242
00:37:10,638 --> 00:37:17,638
What we are fighting are not human,
are much more lethal than we.

243
00:37:18,014 --> 00:37:21,454
You can shoot and destroy the enemy.

244
00:37:22,851 --> 00:37:27,856
The military were here.

245
00:37:32,976 --> 00:37:34,433
They can not stop.

246
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:37,566
They tried but failed.

247
00:37:49,606 --> 00:37:50,542
We.

248
00:37:54,407 --> 00:37:56,626
Take this

249
00:38:13,925 --> 00:38:16,736
I do not know why they did,
but must have a reason.

250
00:38:16,778 --> 00:38:19,140
It makes no sense.

251
00:38:35,288 --> 00:38:37,921
It will not return, is dead.

252
00:38:37,968 --> 00:38:40,293
We do not know that.

253
00:38:40,334 --> 00:38:42,695
Do not leave.

254
00:38:48,962 --> 00:38:50,100
What is it?

255
00:39:39,551 --> 00:39:40,559
It is clear.

256
00:39:42,611 --> 00:39:47,060
- How bad is it? We will stop?
- No, not, give me a hand Eric

257
00:39:48,875 --> 00:39:50,049
1, 2, 3

258
00:39:53,711 --> 00:39:56,344
It is not so serious, will
be fine in a few minutes.

259
00:39:57,504 --> 00:40:00,321
We can not fight these
things if we are dragging.

260
00:40:00,322 --> 00:40:03,138
Sorry, it's tough, but
not die for that.

261
00:40:04,497 --> 00:40:08,697
Shut up... How often will tell
you that we will not stop anyone?

262
00:40:27,808 --> 00:40:28,744
Friend.

263
00:40:33,444 --> 00:40:34,416
Yes?

264
00:40:34,453 --> 00:40:39,316
Will not let you 'You saw what
he did to Evie? The split in two.

265
00:40:41,656 --> 00:40:45,024
These things... are not animals.

266
00:40:46,143 --> 00:40:47,282
What you say?

267
00:40:49,901 --> 00:40:55,630
I saw a recording of the soldiers,
Special Forces Unit came to destroy

268
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:00,819
these things killed the unit.

269
00:41:00,862 --> 00:41:05,831
They were organized in piles,
clothes, necklaces, bones, weapons.

270
00:41:05,870 --> 00:41:08,575
They have more intelligence
than an animal.

271
00:41:08,619 --> 00:41:10,422
How to kill them?

272
00:41:11,958 --> 00:41:14,806
If you are alive, may die

273
00:41:35,444 --> 00:41:37,592
Eric, come, we belong together.

274
00:41:37,637 --> 00:41:43,437
Think I do not know where we are?
They are everywhere.

275
00:41:44,595 --> 00:41:47,264
When no noise, do not come.

276
00:41:47,309 --> 00:41:49,634
We kill one by one.

277
00:41:52,318 --> 00:41:54,300
We have to cross this.

278
00:41:54,371 --> 00:41:55,794
Come.

279
00:42:13,194 --> 00:42:14,891
What place is this?

280
00:42:14,933 --> 00:42:19,347
Panels are.

281
00:42:20,293 --> 00:42:22,368
In what is floating?

282
00:42:22,414 --> 00:42:27,243
The temperature changes.

283
00:42:52,475 --> 00:42:54,242
How deep is it?

284
00:42:55,607 --> 00:42:56,923
Hard to say.

285
00:42:56,964 --> 00:43:01,934
Not cross it, those damn in the water.

286
00:43:01,973 --> 00:43:05,651
We have no choice.

287
00:43:10,012 --> 00:43:13,487
'I do not listen? No it will cross
These stay.

288
00:43:13,525 --> 00:43:16,443
Dies
...Jenna, please.

289
00:43:19,857 --> 00:43:21,694
Hurry 'OK, go, go

290
00:43:33,113 --> 00:43:35,165
Eric, come, do not stay.

291
00:43:37,532 --> 00:43:39,644
Water
...Eric!

292
00:43:39,689 --> 00:43:45,561
What?... These waters are toxic,
these creatures are amphibians.

293
00:43:45,604 --> 00:43:49,009
'Be careful He's right.

294
00:46:00,668 --> 00:46:02,850
Were carried Eric.

295
00:46:18,274 --> 00:46:19,862
There was nothing you could do.

296
00:46:28,573 --> 00:46:29,995
What happened in your chest?

297
00:46:33,442 --> 00:46:35,388
Max told me, tell.

298
00:46:38,489 --> 00:46:45,489
We came from the mission ..
We were at the base

299
00:46:48,404 --> 00:46:50,384
Iraqi police was behind us

300
00:46:52,718 --> 00:46:55,291
and we all jumped up and shot them

301
00:46:58,736 --> 00:47:02,699
and saw two approaching

302
00:47:06,635 --> 00:47:11,356
Matt told me not to shoot, but
I did not hear

303
00:47:12,723 --> 00:47:13,755
shot

304
00:47:15,229 --> 00:47:16,474
and fired

305
00:47:18,985 --> 00:47:20,646
and children were

306
00:47:21,978 --> 00:47:24,552
sent children behind us

307
00:47:30,154 --> 00:47:31,578
and killed.

308
00:47:36,105 --> 00:47:39,438
We threw grenades

309
00:47:41,498 --> 00:47:43,787
Matty took me to a safe place.

310
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:48,687
He took the shot.

311
00:48:05,956 --> 00:48:07,546
It's my guardian angel.

312
00:48:25,126 --> 00:48:27,274
We must focus.

313
00:48:28,918 --> 00:48:31,101
Come on, we have to concentrate.

314
00:48:48,507 --> 00:48:49,717
We got company!

315
00:49:10,602 --> 00:49:12,298
Looking for a generator.

316
00:50:27,666 --> 00:50:29,161
Okay, soldier.

317
00:50:34,416 --> 00:50:36,006
Look at this

318
00:51:08,861 --> 00:51:15,019
I created a creature face

319
00:51:15,054 --> 00:51:18,637
that can replace soldiers

320
00:51:20,168 --> 00:51:27,168
these creatures are made for
the French Navy and American

321
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:36,792
American prototypes.

322
00:51:36,834 --> 00:51:43,834
Soldiers
...Using a radical form of genetic

323
00:51:43,967 --> 00:51:50,967
animal and human

324
00:51:55,830 --> 00:52:02,830
with a high mortality rate, we created
these creatures of human mothers.

325
00:52:11,905 --> 00:52:17,599
Women have obtained.

326
00:52:17,646 --> 00:52:21,146
Feeding with blood, I
got that creatures

327
00:52:21,147 --> 00:52:24,646
survive in the womb of
their human mothers

328
00:52:36,538 --> 00:52:43,538
to create a new species.

329
00:52:47,428 --> 00:52:52,779
Our older generations
were more primitive

330
00:52:54,039 --> 00:53:01,039
but the following may be transmitted.

331
00:53:04,130 --> 00:53:11,130
You can call them as they
want but I call them Frogs.

332
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:24,270
They think like soldiers.

333
00:53:25,839 --> 00:53:27,678
That's why you kept alive.

334
00:53:27,718 --> 00:53:29,971
To use you as an incubator.

335
00:53:32,485 --> 00:53:33,315
Yes?

336
00:53:34,225 --> 00:53:38,780
The army teaches us to kill and create
these things for the same purpose.

337
00:53:39,826 --> 00:53:41,416
Now they want to kill?

338
00:53:41,462 --> 00:53:44,760
Someone left this plan.

339
00:53:44,802 --> 00:53:50,531
Do you mean?... That whatever it is,
we can not tell anyone that went down.

340
00:53:50,577 --> 00:53:54,053
That's right, the military
will not let us tell.

341
00:53:54,091 --> 00:53:58,018
If we talk, we will disappear.

342
00:53:58,056 --> 00:54:00,631
If we fall, we die
and if we, we die also.

343
00:54:00,667 --> 00:54:05,115
No, when we leave,
we will stay silent.

344
00:54:07,313 --> 00:54:10,433
If you are part animal, what they fear
Most animals?

345
00:54:12,149 --> 00:54:17,155
Fire? 'Exactly, if we adecuandos
chemicals, we can overcome

346
00:54:20,638 --> 00:54:22,370
I agree, better to try.

347
00:54:22,412 --> 00:54:24,358
Doctor.

348
00:54:38,834 --> 00:54:39,902
Bingo.

349
00:54:49,342 --> 00:54:50,837
Check this out.

350
00:54:50,873 --> 00:54:54,870
If you could ignite the whole place.

351
00:54:54,907 --> 00:55:00,259
If we unite, we can overcome.

352
00:55:00,302 --> 00:55:02,769
Do not want to fight in groups.

353
00:55:02,806 --> 00:55:04,501
Shit.

354
00:55:41,531 --> 00:55:42,955
Come back, come!

355
00:55:56,387 --> 00:55:57,394
Jenna!

356
00:57:00,335 --> 00:57:02,448
You should be here.

357
00:57:12,619 --> 00:57:15,120
Please, please help.

358
00:57:21,177 --> 00:57:22,493
Help us out.

359
00:57:25,630 --> 00:57:28,964
Once you enter, do not go.

360
00:57:40,416 --> 00:57:41,388
Mat!

361
00:57:41,460 --> 00:57:43,333
I'm here!

362
00:57:47,967 --> 00:57:49,282
I'm down here!

363
00:57:57,883 --> 00:58:04,883
To make my creatures, deadly
I found the best way to create.

364
00:58:14,269 --> 00:58:21,187
My drugs make them better

365
00:58:21,229 --> 00:58:25,747
but makes a bit angry.

366
00:58:25,786 --> 00:58:28,384
What say?

367
00:58:28,430 --> 00:58:35,239
My drug test No, do not wanna die.

368
00:58:35,285 --> 00:58:40,327
No, no, no others!

369
00:58:40,364 --> 00:58:43,033
I can save.

370
00:58:43,078 --> 00:58:46,340
Yes, I know.

371
00:58:46,383 --> 00:58:51,284
- What is your name?
- Jenna.

372
00:58:51,325 --> 00:58:55,950
Thank you, thank you very much.

373
00:58:55,986 --> 00:59:02,071
Come, come, come.

374
00:59:05,554 --> 00:59:10,110
Your eyes are beautiful.

375
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:30,492
Come, come here.

376
00:59:30,536 --> 00:59:34,699
Let me take.

377
01:00:48,401 --> 01:00:51,662
Are you okay?

378
01:01:01,239 --> 01:01:04,608
Stay close.

379
01:01:18,950 --> 01:01:19,886
Shit!

380
01:01:22,810 --> 01:01:24,719
Are you okay?

381
01:01:26,569 --> 01:01:28,027
Just a scratch.

382
01:01:29,282 --> 01:01:30,704
Where is Jenna?

383
01:01:30,743 --> 01:01:33,626
I do not know brother.

384
01:01:51,445 --> 01:01:53,841
Should not enter.

385
01:01:55,133 --> 01:01:58,015
Believe me, no return.

386
01:01:59,622 --> 01:02:04,140
Neither your friend Jenna.

387
01:02:04,179 --> 01:02:06,255
Fuck you, man!

388
01:02:06,302 --> 01:02:10,465
Typical American.

389
01:02:10,511 --> 01:02:17,511
You're a damned fool,
left you here alone like a rat.

390
01:02:18,271 --> 01:02:21,771
No, I'm left here with my
project, to create more

391
01:02:21,772 --> 01:02:25,271
for thewar I will save
many lives and the glory.

392
01:02:37,580 --> 01:02:39,940
At what price?

393
01:02:42,207 --> 01:02:45,541
Collateral Damage.

394
01:03:24,411 --> 01:03:25,941
Come on, come on!

395
01:03:32,169 --> 01:03:33,628
I think we lost.

396
01:03:37,772 --> 01:03:40,998
We're going down that
road and then down.

397
01:03:41,041 --> 01:03:42,879
A taste.

398
01:04:48,123 --> 01:04:48,880
Shit.

399
01:05:50,679 --> 01:05:51,650
Mat?

400
01:06:21,504 --> 01:06:22,370
Mat!

401
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:29,111
Mat?

402
01:06:29,159 --> 01:06:34,166
Look at me!

403
01:06:46,591 --> 01:06:47,620
I!

404
01:06:59,742 --> 01:07:00,714
Sorry.

405
01:07:59,307 --> 01:08:00,315
Look up.

406
01:08:41,928 --> 01:08:43,208
Come on, damn!

407
01:08:58,420 --> 01:09:00,472
It is dead quiet, dead!

408
01:09:06,838 --> 01:09:08,013
We.

409
01:09:14,146 --> 01:09:15,154
Storm!

410
01:09:27,262 --> 01:09:28,757
Hello.

411
01:09:35,057 --> 01:09:37,238
Well, team.

412
01:09:42,085 --> 01:09:43,814
Put your arm around my neck,
will carry you.

413
01:09:43,850 --> 01:09:49,414
No, come on, man...

414
01:09:49,495 --> 01:09:52,307
Look.

415
01:09:52,349 --> 01:09:59,349
We have seen men like that, not
even that bad, and did not make it.

416
01:10:00,907 --> 01:10:03,409
They broke my stomach,
I'm not going anywhere.

417
01:10:09,501 --> 01:10:11,031
They have to fight.

418
01:10:11,066 --> 01:10:13,355
Well done.

419
01:10:14,755 --> 01:10:15,857
Very well.

420
01:10:17,538 --> 01:10:23,518
This is what I deserve for
killing those children

421
01:10:23,557 --> 01:10:25,668
I feel so bad about it
...Not.

422
01:10:25,714 --> 01:10:27,659
Do not do that.

423
01:10:30,064 --> 01:10:37,064
Listen to me, okay? You out of
here and take you to a hospital

424
01:10:41,510 --> 01:10:44,951
I'm not going to be OK, Matty

425
01:10:44,990 --> 01:10:50,554
I can load on your neck.

426
01:10:50,591 --> 01:10:53,747
Those things will kill you,
I will only waste your time

427
01:10:56,645 --> 01:10:58,175
I can not leave.

428
01:10:58,210 --> 01:11:03,453
Will not live long.

429
01:11:03,499 --> 01:11:06,654
You heard what he said?

430
01:11:06,700 --> 01:11:11,256
He said he will not live long.

431
01:11:22,913 --> 01:11:25,759
Clava something in my chest now
you hear me?

432
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:27,913
Now, Matty.

433
01:11:30,916 --> 01:11:32,648
Do not leave me this way

434
01:11:42,257 --> 01:11:43,361
I love you, brother

435
01:11:45,354 --> 01:11:46,778
I really do.

436
01:11:46,815 --> 01:11:53,815
Look, this fucking cares for me
Do you agree?

437
01:12:03,935 --> 01:12:08,620
Well, that's a thank

438
01:12:14,059 --> 01:12:17,533
I can not believe you got back.

439
01:12:20,773 --> 01:12:22,647
Semper Fi.

440
01:12:24,878 --> 01:12:27,417
Do it now, damn.

441
01:12:52,609 --> 01:12:53,855
Curse.

442
01:13:36,203 --> 01:13:37,662
Time to go.

443
01:13:37,699 --> 01:13:40,819
It's time to go home.

444
01:13:55,618 --> 01:13:58,192
The missing girl's name
is Evie, her parents

445
01:13:58,193 --> 01:14:00,766
say who went to a rave
at the military base

446
01:14:00,801 --> 01:14:03,269
would be good to go there and check

447
01:14:10,301 --> 01:14:11,831
I have fear.

448
01:14:17,050 --> 01:14:18,189
Hey.

449
01:14:18,233 --> 01:14:20,806
We leave here.

450
01:15:27,018 --> 01:15:28,334
No way out, we.

451
01:16:31,316 --> 01:16:32,382
What the hell happened?

452
01:16:35,455 --> 01:16:38,231
They are alone?
Where is Evie?

453
01:16:47,076 --> 01:16:51,561
Sheriff, Sheriff, now!
No!

454
01:17:15,675 --> 01:17:16,920
No!

455
01:18:06,403 --> 01:18:07,203
We did.

456
01:18:36,429 --> 01:18:39,276
How can we continue?

457
01:18:43,282 --> 01:18:44,350
Do not know

458
01:18:48,990 --> 01:18:50,615
I guess we have to.

459
01:18:50,660 --> 01:18:53,957
And learn to put it in the past.

460
01:18:54,034 --> 01:18:57,712
Try

461
01:19:12,752 --> 01:19:15,255
I feel so guilty

462
01:19:17,518 --> 01:19:18,942
I will miss him

463
01:19:24,372 --> 01:19:26,698
I love you And I love you.

464
01:21:00,365 --> 01:21:01,266
What is it?

465
01:21:01,305 --> 01:21:04,567
I can not get out of my head.

466
01:21:08,508 --> 01:21:10,796
Okay, it's just a nightmare.

467
01:21:13,900 --> 01:21:15,110
You're safe, right?

468
01:21:15,187 --> 01:21:18,521
You're safe.

469
01:21:32,584 --> 01:21:33,900
Okay.

470
01:22:16,701 --> 01:22:17,638
Mat.

471
01:22:20,423 --> 01:22:21,395
Who was it?

472
01:22:21,432 --> 01:22:26,058
Mat?

473
01:22:33,853 --> 01:22:36,214
Get away from me!
