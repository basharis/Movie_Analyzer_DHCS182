1
00:04:54,925 --> 00:04:56,301
What the hell?

2
00:05:02,223 --> 00:05:03,349
Hey.

3
00:05:09,429 --> 00:05:11,849
You know which side of the border
you are on?

4
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:14,266
You got a name for it?

5
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:21,773
Guess... someone must
have cut your tongue off.

6
00:05:24,317 --> 00:05:25,651
Either that, or...

7
00:05:28,278 --> 00:05:30,322
Or has something

8
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:33,033
To hide.

9
00:05:36,953 --> 00:05:38,371
As far as I can tell...

10
00:05:41,915 --> 00:05:43,707
You hear me plain enough.

11
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,385
Walter Henderson.

12
00:05:58,554 --> 00:06:01,140
Now I want to ask you one last question.

13
00:06:03,266 --> 00:06:05,017
You see this here card?

14
00:06:06,435 --> 00:06:07,561
Is this you?

15
00:06:09,688 --> 00:06:11,357
Or a relative of yours?

16
00:06:14,818 --> 00:06:17,655
Well, I'm going to call up this number.

17
00:06:18,072 --> 00:06:21,240
And see if they can tell me who you are.

18
00:06:21,616 --> 00:06:25,203
I ain't got beds enough to be putting up mutes.

19
00:06:33,417 --> 00:06:37,381
Operator. I need a line out please.

20
00:06:53,354 --> 00:06:54,438
What?

21
00:06:55,189 --> 00:06:59,191
What, can you... can you tell me
the exact location of your hospital down there?

22
00:07:01,819 --> 00:07:03,112
Where the hell is that?

23
00:07:05,114 --> 00:07:06,365
Oh, OK, alright.

24
00:07:06,824 --> 00:07:10,534
Yeah, OK, I'll be there as fast as I can.

25
00:07:11,201 --> 00:07:13,495
Just, will you tell him that I'm coming, OK?

26
00:07:13,954 --> 00:07:14,788
OK.

27
00:07:20,667 --> 00:07:23,169
Steven, I think you will have to change that...

28
00:07:23,461 --> 00:07:25,880
- This section right here?
- Yeah, because it's incomplete.

29
00:07:26,089 --> 00:07:27,549
Ann, honey?

30
00:07:29,342 --> 00:07:31,428
I just got the strangest phone call.

31
00:07:31,803 --> 00:07:32,846
Who from?

32
00:07:33,096 --> 00:07:36,807
From some hospital in south Texas.
A place called Terlingua.

33
00:07:38,349 --> 00:07:40,268
They say they found Travis.

34
00:07:40,768 --> 00:07:41,894
Oh, no.

35
00:07:43,313 --> 00:07:44,439
What are you going to do?

36
00:07:44,814 --> 00:07:46,647
Well, I'll go down and get him.

37
00:07:47,148 --> 00:07:48,065
Oh, wow.

38
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:50,818
Well, what am I going to do?
I can't leave him down there.

39
00:07:54,322 --> 00:07:55,699
What about Hunter?

40
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,326
What am I supposed to tell him?

41
00:07:58,701 --> 00:08:01,494
Well, just tell him
I had to go on a business trip.

42
00:08:02,078 --> 00:08:03,580
I mean about Travis.

43
00:08:12,296 --> 00:08:14,423
I guess you better tell him the truth.

44
00:08:35,775 --> 00:08:38,818
Ten to Vanhorn 90...

45
00:08:39,861 --> 00:08:41,863
The Alpine 118 south.

46
00:08:44,407 --> 00:08:45,575
Terlingua.

47
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:19,061
You must be the brother of the mute.

48
00:09:20,437 --> 00:09:22,273
- Mute?
- Yeah.

49
00:09:23,649 --> 00:09:27,027
I couldn't squeeze the time of day out of him.

50
00:09:28,695 --> 00:09:31,030
Must be in a kind of jam.

51
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:35,326
I don't know, I haven't seen him
in over 4 years.

52
00:09:36,327 --> 00:09:37,537
Is that right?

53
00:09:38,788 --> 00:09:43,040
Well, a lot can happen
to a man in 4 years.

54
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,626
All kinds of trouble.

55
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:47,920
Bits of trouble.

56
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:49,422
What do you mean?

57
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,964
Well, down here,

58
00:09:52,173 --> 00:09:55,009
A man gets himself into a fix sometimes.

59
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:57,970
It costs him a little to get him out.

60
00:09:58,470 --> 00:09:59,930
If you understand what I mean.

61
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:03,435
I don't understand you.

62
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:06,521
I wish you get to the point,
because I'd like to see my brother.

63
00:10:08,898 --> 00:10:09,898
Alright son.

64
00:10:10,816 --> 00:10:13,152
But first I would like to ask you something.

65
00:10:14,111 --> 00:10:18,282
Did your brother ever get himself
into a car wreck?

66
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,411
Car wreck, no...

67
00:10:24,995 --> 00:10:26,288
Not that I know of.

68
00:10:27,331 --> 00:10:30,206
Then he must be mixing
with some hard company.

69
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:34,627
I'd like to see my brother now.
If you don't mind...

70
00:10:35,961 --> 00:10:37,171
He disappeared.

71
00:10:37,755 --> 00:10:39,257
You mean he's not here?

72
00:10:39,966 --> 00:10:41,676
After I came all this way?

73
00:10:42,552 --> 00:10:44,929
He's been gone since early this morning.

74
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:49,849
We have his possessions.
Never the less...

75
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,643
Saved them.

76
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,855
We'd be glad to turn him over to you.

77
00:10:56,564 --> 00:11:00,524
Soon, as you take care of our little reward.

78
00:12:38,193 --> 00:12:39,402
Travis, hey!

79
00:12:43,906 --> 00:12:46,450
Don't you recognize me? It's Walt!

80
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:56,208
It's your brother, Walt.

81
00:13:15,142 --> 00:13:16,809
What the hell happened to you, anyway?

82
00:13:16,809 --> 00:13:18,561
You look like 40 miles of rough road.

83
00:13:29,446 --> 00:13:31,406
Come on, let's get in the car. Trav?

84
00:13:33,242 --> 00:13:33,784
Come on...

85
00:14:27,956 --> 00:14:29,666
Here Trav, here's your stuff.

86
00:14:31,668 --> 00:14:33,586
Got that back at that clinic back there.

87
00:14:35,629 --> 00:14:37,338
Sure picked a hell of a spot to land in.

88
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:39,883
I don't blame you for running out of it.

89
00:14:46,721 --> 00:14:47,763
Look, Trav...

90
00:14:48,806 --> 00:14:50,558
We've got quite a bit of traveling to do here,

91
00:14:50,641 --> 00:14:52,935
You're not going to clam up
the whole way, are you?

92
00:14:53,978 --> 00:14:55,687
I'm going to get kinda lonely.

93
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:01,443
Trav?

94
00:15:03,904 --> 00:15:07,240
Would you mind telling me
where you disappeared to for the last 4 years?

95
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:15,245
Have you seen Jane, or talked to her?

96
00:15:18,415 --> 00:15:20,083
Ann and I are...

97
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:22,794
We sort of gave up on you. We actually...

98
00:15:24,252 --> 00:15:25,754
We thought you were dead, boy.

99
00:16:01,826 --> 00:16:03,370
This is pretty a...

100
00:16:14,672 --> 00:16:15,923
You OK?

101
00:16:25,099 --> 00:16:25,766
Well...

102
00:16:31,395 --> 00:16:32,938
Well, gee Trav, maybe you want to...

103
00:16:33,772 --> 00:16:35,941
Clean up. Take a shower or something?

104
00:16:36,608 --> 00:16:39,571
I think I'll go back into town
and get you some new cloths.

105
00:16:39,902 --> 00:16:41,404
You could use a new set of cloths, couldn’t you?

106
00:16:44,407 --> 00:16:46,075
What size shoes do you wear?

107
00:16:48,995 --> 00:16:49,952
Lets see...

108
00:16:53,789 --> 00:16:55,457
I'm probably one size bigger, huh?

109
00:16:58,168 --> 00:16:59,670
So, where did you find that beard?

110
00:17:01,213 --> 00:17:02,172
It's pretty snazzy.

111
00:17:06,384 --> 00:17:09,553
OK, I'll zip into town and zip right back.

112
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,390
I won't be gone long.

113
00:17:20,438 --> 00:17:21,647
You'll be OK, won't you, Trav?

114
00:17:25,276 --> 00:17:26,736
OK, I'll be right back.

115
00:19:19,457 --> 00:19:20,208
Damn it.

116
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:21,261
You mind telling me
where you are headed, Trav?

117
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:26,975
What's out there?

118
00:20:34,232 --> 00:20:35,566
There's nothing out there.

119
00:20:38,819 --> 00:20:40,654
Don't you trust me or something?

120
00:20:44,865 --> 00:20:47,493
I'm just trying to help you Trav, that's all.

121
00:20:52,873 --> 00:20:54,207
Come on, it's alright.

122
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:56,376
Come on with me in the car.

123
00:22:04,017 --> 00:22:05,977
Feels good to be in new cloths, huh?

124
00:22:30,499 --> 00:22:32,666
Hi, Hunter? It's Daddy.

125
00:22:33,834 --> 00:22:35,793
I thought you'd be in bed already.

126
00:22:37,629 --> 00:22:40,841
Guess who I'm visiting, here in Texas.

127
00:22:43,552 --> 00:22:44,512
Your father.

128
00:22:45,513 --> 00:22:46,931
Do you remember your father?

129
00:22:49,516 --> 00:22:50,517
Not at all?

130
00:22:53,936 --> 00:22:54,937
He was?

131
00:22:57,064 --> 00:22:58,190
Well, guess what?

132
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,817
I'm going to bring him home to visit.

133
00:23:16,955 --> 00:23:18,081
Travis

134
00:23:21,251 --> 00:23:24,587
Do you remember your little boy?
Hunter?

135
00:23:27,923 --> 00:23:29,174
Well, he's with us.

136
00:23:30,299 --> 00:23:33,344
He's been living with Ann and me
ever since you disappeared.

137
00:23:35,263 --> 00:23:36,889
We didn't know what else to do.

138
00:23:37,223 --> 00:23:38,808
So, we just kept him.

139
00:23:40,892 --> 00:23:43,645
One day, he was just standing at the door.

140
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:48,442
All he could tell us was that
someone brought him there in a car.

141
00:23:49,985 --> 00:23:51,361
He didn't know what had happened to you,

142
00:23:51,694 --> 00:23:53,195
Or Jane.

143
00:23:53,696 --> 00:23:56,991
So we tried everything we could
think of to find you, or Jane.

144
00:23:57,908 --> 00:23:59,994
Tried to locate her, she vanished too.

145
00:24:02,037 --> 00:24:03,789
We didn't know what else to do.

146
00:24:08,792 --> 00:24:10,544
Travis,

147
00:24:11,295 --> 00:24:13,505
I don't know what kind of trouble
you got into.

148
00:24:14,673 --> 00:24:16,341
I don't know what happened.

149
00:24:18,009 --> 00:24:20,887
But damn it, I'm your brother man.

150
00:24:22,555 --> 00:24:24,056
You can talk to me.

151
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:30,436
I'm tired of doing all the taking.

152
00:25:13,389 --> 00:25:14,933
Fill it with unleaded please.

153
00:25:17,936 --> 00:25:20,729
You know, I'm getting a little sick
with this silence routine.

154
00:25:21,772 --> 00:25:22,982
You can talk.

155
00:25:32,533 --> 00:25:34,658
I can be silent too you know.

156
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:40,205
I just assumed that if we kept
our mouths shut for the rest of the trip

157
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:42,082
- Paris.
- What?

158
00:25:45,209 --> 00:25:46,167
Paris.

159
00:25:52,132 --> 00:25:53,133
Paris?

160
00:25:54,342 --> 00:25:55,343
Paris?

161
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,847
Did you ever go to Paris?

162
00:26:01,266 --> 00:26:02,099
No.

163
00:26:03,475 --> 00:26:04,768
Could we go there now?

164
00:26:07,563 --> 00:26:09,148
It's a little out of the way.

165
00:26:13,024 --> 00:26:15,402
Ah, I've never even been to Europe.

166
00:26:15,777 --> 00:26:17,195
Ann keeps on wanting to go there.

167
00:26:18,029 --> 00:26:20,282
Cus, she is from France, you remember?

168
00:26:21,072 --> 00:26:22,532
But we never seem to find the time,

169
00:26:22,866 --> 00:26:25,409
Because my company kinda keeps me busy.

170
00:26:40,965 --> 00:26:41,966
Lets go Trav.

171
00:26:45,428 --> 00:26:46,429
What's the matter?

172
00:26:47,138 --> 00:26:48,222
Where are we going?

173
00:26:48,556 --> 00:26:49,930
We're going to fly to L.A.

174
00:26:50,765 --> 00:26:52,349
You're not afraid of flying, are you?

175
00:26:53,684 --> 00:26:55,811
- Leaving the ground?
- Yeah.

176
00:26:56,979 --> 00:26:58,105
Why?

177
00:26:58,481 --> 00:27:00,231
Because it's too far to drive.

178
00:27:00,732 --> 00:27:02,901
It would take an extra 2 days,
I can't afford the time, Trav.

179
00:27:03,234 --> 00:27:04,402
Why?

180
00:27:04,736 --> 00:27:09,825
It's just easier to fly, Trav.
It's faster. Come on.

181
00:27:29,257 --> 00:27:30,759
It's all OK.

182
00:27:31,301 --> 00:27:34,180
When I get you home, I'll get you settled
and then you can do whatever you want.

183
00:27:35,306 --> 00:27:38,892
But sir, we can't stop the plane
whenever someone gets terrified.

184
00:27:39,059 --> 00:27:41,852
Don't get on a plane and then
refuse to leave the ground.

185
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,980
Don't do things like that,
this isn't the wilderness.

186
00:27:45,898 --> 00:27:47,399
You're living with people now.

187
00:27:48,234 --> 00:27:51,695
You should have acquired a private plane,
do you know how many people you are detaining?

188
00:27:51,987 --> 00:27:53,154
Sorry!

189
00:27:53,321 --> 00:27:55,949
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry! OK?

190
00:27:58,783 --> 00:28:01,327
This is getting a little ridiculous Travis.

191
00:28:03,037 --> 00:28:04,497
Are you going to leave me?

192
00:28:05,414 --> 00:28:07,415
No, I'm not going to leave you.

193
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:10,710
It's alright if you leave me.

194
00:28:11,753 --> 00:28:15,381
I don't know honey, no...
He just panicked or something.

195
00:28:17,133 --> 00:28:19,801
Well, it won't do any good to try
another plane, it wasn't the plane,

196
00:28:20,009 --> 00:28:21,511
he'll just get off again.

197
00:28:22,804 --> 00:28:25,557
Well, we're just going to
have to drive it, that's all.

198
00:28:26,266 --> 00:28:27,851
Yeah, it'll take a good 2 days.

199
00:28:31,854 --> 00:28:35,148
I don't understand why you have to
have the exact same car you had before.

200
00:28:35,481 --> 00:28:36,816
They are all alike.

201
00:28:37,066 --> 00:28:38,901
All the cars we have here are Birds,

202
00:28:39,026 --> 00:28:41,196
Olds, Chevy’s, and whatever.

203
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:44,156
- I'm not even sure I can locate the same car...
- I know...

204
00:28:44,823 --> 00:28:48,910
My brother left something in the car,
we are hoping we can search the car and find it.

205
00:28:49,244 --> 00:28:52,372
Oh, well, I'll just contact the lost
and found department for you, if that's OK sir.

206
00:28:52,414 --> 00:28:54,457
No, we have to have the very same car.

207
00:28:54,999 --> 00:28:57,834
Well, I can't do that.
There is no way I can trace the car for you.

208
00:28:58,209 --> 00:29:00,795
Well, why not?
You have the license number
right on your form there.

209
00:29:00,879 --> 00:29:03,381
- Well, yes but...
- Well, just give us the license number
and we'll find it.

210
00:29:03,715 --> 00:29:06,009
But I can't allow you on the lot sir.

211
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:08,636
Why not? We're already on it!

212
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:11,555
I just have to ask you
to come back to the office with me.

213
00:29:14,558 --> 00:29:17,102
- Travis!
- What?

214
00:29:18,103 --> 00:29:20,481
I don't think we're going to get the very same car.

215
00:29:20,814 --> 00:29:23,940
But I can rent you a model
just like the one you had before, sir.

216
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:28,111
I need the same car Walt.
How are we going to go in another car?

217
00:29:29,946 --> 00:29:31,863
Give us the number, will you, please?

218
00:29:33,156 --> 00:29:34,740
Come on... pretty please?

219
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:40,329
Alright, that number is 667DJP

220
00:29:40,454 --> 00:29:42,831
You remember that? 667DJP?

221
00:29:43,332 --> 00:29:45,460
- It's got a bump on the hood.
- Yes it does...

222
00:30:01,305 --> 00:30:02,264
What's that?

223
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,557
What?

224
00:30:04,141 --> 00:30:05,226
That, what you got in your hand?

225
00:30:06,852 --> 00:30:07,937
A picture.

226
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:09,729
A picture of what?

227
00:30:10,396 --> 00:30:11,898
A picture of...

228
00:30:14,733 --> 00:30:15,442
Paris.

229
00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:17,987
Paris, really?

230
00:30:18,488 --> 00:30:20,698
Yes, picture of a piece of Paris.

231
00:30:21,032 --> 00:30:22,992
Where did you get a picture of Paris?

232
00:30:23,576 --> 00:30:25,078
- Can I see it?
- Yes.

233
00:30:27,121 --> 00:30:29,330
This is it?
This is Paris?

234
00:30:30,249 --> 00:30:32,084
Looks just like Texas to me.

235
00:30:32,251 --> 00:30:33,627
It is.

236
00:30:34,002 --> 00:30:35,712
Paris, Texas?

237
00:30:36,797 --> 00:30:37,756
It's right here on the map.

238
00:30:37,965 --> 00:30:39,381
There's really a place called Paris, Texas?

239
00:30:39,548 --> 00:30:41,049
It's right here.

240
00:30:43,802 --> 00:30:46,721
Well, how come you got a picture
of a vacant lot in Paris, Texas?

241
00:30:47,763 --> 00:30:48,848
It's mine.

242
00:30:49,682 --> 00:30:52,017
I know that, but how come you got it?

243
00:30:52,893 --> 00:30:56,480
I purchased it in the mail...

244
00:30:57,148 --> 00:30:58,441
A long time ago.

245
00:30:59,233 --> 00:31:01,777
You bought a picture
of vacant lot in the mail?

246
00:31:02,111 --> 00:31:04,154
No, I bought the land...

247
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:06,779
- Oh, you bought that lot.
- Yes.

248
00:31:07,113 --> 00:31:08,156
Oh, let me see again.

249
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:12,493
There's nothing on it.

250
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:15,037
Empty.

251
00:31:16,122 --> 00:31:19,957
Well, why in hell would you want to buy
a vacant lot in Paris, Texas for Christ's sake?

252
00:31:30,467 --> 00:31:31,634
I forgot.

253
00:31:34,012 --> 00:31:34,888
Here Trav.

254
00:31:42,728 --> 00:31:45,646
Do you remember
what mama's very first name was?

255
00:31:46,481 --> 00:31:47,648
Marry.

256
00:31:48,191 --> 00:31:52,779
No, I know, I mean, her...
before she found daddy.

257
00:31:53,196 --> 00:31:54,987
- Oh, her median name?
- Yeah.

258
00:31:55,906 --> 00:31:57,866
You don't remember her median name?

259
00:31:58,325 --> 00:31:59,451
No...

260
00:32:00,577 --> 00:32:01,745
Sekinae.

261
00:32:03,163 --> 00:32:04,413
Sekinae.

262
00:32:04,747 --> 00:32:05,873
Spanish.

263
00:32:06,415 --> 00:32:07,665
Her father was.

264
00:32:08,249 --> 00:32:09,334
Yeah?

265
00:32:15,298 --> 00:32:16,633
I don't believe it.

266
00:32:18,885 --> 00:32:20,803
You finally decided to eat!

267
00:32:21,845 --> 00:32:23,763
Eating and talking!

268
00:32:24,097 --> 00:32:26,849
Before you know it,
you will be back in the land of the living.

269
00:32:31,355 --> 00:32:32,521
You want me to drive?

270
00:32:33,522 --> 00:32:35,607
Sure! Think you remember how?

271
00:32:36,441 --> 00:32:37,859
My body remembers.

272
00:32:43,446 --> 00:32:45,197
You can sleep while I drive.

273
00:32:46,615 --> 00:32:47,408
OK.

274
00:33:02,422 --> 00:33:03,881
Well, Trav...

275
00:33:04,924 --> 00:33:06,676
I think maybe you are ready to...

276
00:33:07,677 --> 00:33:09,846
Tell me what the hell happened to you
over the last 4 years.

277
00:33:12,471 --> 00:33:13,723
No, not yet.

278
00:33:50,004 --> 00:33:50,963
Travis!

279
00:33:51,714 --> 00:33:52,506
What?

280
00:34:08,314 --> 00:34:10,608
Where are we, Travis?
What happened?

281
00:34:12,777 --> 00:34:14,360
Why did we get off the high way.

282
00:34:15,403 --> 00:34:17,155
Jesus Christ...

283
00:34:17,278 --> 00:34:19,906
I can't even sleep for 5 minutes
without some crisis.

284
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:21,574
Why did you turn off?

285
00:34:25,244 --> 00:34:28,329
I don't know where I turned off.
Didn't have a name.

286
00:34:30,706 --> 00:34:31,999
That's great.

287
00:34:32,291 --> 00:34:33,959
That's just damn great.

288
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:37,796
Where we are in the middle of the Mohabi desert
and a place that doesn't have a name.

289
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:42,342
I could find the high way again.

290
00:35:03,695 --> 00:35:06,070
Trav, I need to talk to you a little
about Hunter.

291
00:35:06,987 --> 00:35:08,614
How old is he now?

292
00:35:08,948 --> 00:35:11,575
He's eight in January.

293
00:35:12,536 --> 00:35:14,662
- She’s seven then.
- Yeah.

294
00:35:16,706 --> 00:35:19,374
But see, what I want to talk about is...

295
00:35:20,959 --> 00:35:24,629
Well, he's like part of the family now.

296
00:35:26,631 --> 00:35:28,758
Ann and me are like his parents now.

297
00:35:30,342 --> 00:35:31,301
Ann's your wife.

298
00:35:31,927 --> 00:35:33,262
Yeah, you remember her, don't you?

299
00:35:34,053 --> 00:35:36,264
No... Does he think
that you're his father?

300
00:35:38,558 --> 00:35:42,103
Well, Ann told him you were coming.

301
00:35:44,228 --> 00:35:45,814
Well, who does he think I am?

302
00:35:46,815 --> 00:35:50,444
I told him you are his father.

303
00:35:51,361 --> 00:35:52,819
But see,

304
00:35:54,279 --> 00:35:56,071
You've been gone a long time, Trav.

305
00:35:57,197 --> 00:35:58,866
How long have I been gone? Do you know?

306
00:36:00,701 --> 00:36:01,618
4 years.

307
00:36:03,287 --> 00:36:05,330
Is 4 years a long time?

308
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:10,334
It is for a little boy.

309
00:36:12,419 --> 00:36:13,378
It's half his life.

310
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:17,592
Half a boy's life.

311
00:36:21,385 --> 00:36:22,762
I remember now...

312
00:36:23,721 --> 00:36:24,597
What?

313
00:36:28,059 --> 00:36:29,727
Why I bought that land.

314
00:36:30,102 --> 00:36:31,436
Oh, why?

315
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:34,813
Well, mama once told me that...

316
00:36:35,147 --> 00:36:37,691
That's where she and daddy first...

317
00:36:38,025 --> 00:36:39,360
Made love.

318
00:36:40,527 --> 00:36:42,071
Oh, in Paris, Texas?

319
00:36:43,447 --> 00:36:45,532
- Yeah.
- She told you that?

320
00:36:45,532 --> 00:36:46,532
Yeah.

321
00:36:48,368 --> 00:36:52,372
So... I thought that...

322
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:55,208
that's where I began.

323
00:36:55,625 --> 00:37:00,586
I mean me, Travis Calve Henderson.
They named me that.

324
00:37:01,796 --> 00:37:03,547
I started out there.

325
00:37:05,299 --> 00:37:08,219
- Paris Texas, huh?
- Yeah...

326
00:37:12,221 --> 00:37:14,473
So you think
maybe you were conceived there?

327
00:37:16,016 --> 00:37:17,101
Yeah.

328
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:18,895
You could be right, Travis.

329
00:37:21,231 --> 00:37:23,359
Daddy always had a joke about it.

330
00:37:24,443 --> 00:37:25,902
What was the joke?

331
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:29,570
He's... he would introduce mama

332
00:37:29,862 --> 00:37:32,240
As the girl he met in Paris.

333
00:37:32,865 --> 00:37:34,158
And then he would wait

334
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:39,245
Before he said Texas,
so everybody thought that...

335
00:37:39,412 --> 00:37:42,540
He meant...
He would wait

336
00:37:42,623 --> 00:37:45,251
Before he said Texas
till everybody thought,

337
00:37:45,334 --> 00:37:48,712
After everybody thought
that he was talking about Paris, France.

338
00:37:49,087 --> 00:37:51,588
He always laughed real hard about it.

339
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,636
So you live in Los Angles, huh?

340
00:37:57,637 --> 00:37:59,139
Yeah, well we live in suburbs,

341
00:37:59,305 --> 00:38:01,349
But I've got my business in town.

342
00:38:02,183 --> 00:38:03,475
What's your business?

343
00:38:04,309 --> 00:38:06,561
I make billboard signs for advertisements.

344
00:38:07,729 --> 00:38:08,855
Oh, yeah?

345
00:38:09,897 --> 00:38:12,567
You're the one that makes all those...
I love those.

346
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:14,235
Some of them are beautiful.

347
00:38:14,569 --> 00:38:16,902
I'm not the only one in the world
that make's them, Trav.

348
00:38:40,924 --> 00:38:42,676
Trav? This way.

349
00:38:43,635 --> 00:38:46,554
Nice, huh?
Just been in here 3 months.

350
00:38:46,929 --> 00:38:49,974
I really like it,
but I took a beating financing, I'll tell ya.

351
00:38:50,558 --> 00:38:52,602
Like everybody else.

352
00:38:59,815 --> 00:39:00,941
Hi baby.

353
00:39:02,652 --> 00:39:04,486
- Everything OK here?
- Oh, sure...

354
00:39:04,652 --> 00:39:06,820
We just miss you a lot.

355
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:08,280
I missed you too.

356
00:39:09,573 --> 00:39:11,408
- Come on in.
- Travis.

357
00:39:16,413 --> 00:39:17,748
My God.

358
00:39:18,624 --> 00:39:22,042
We were beginning to wonder
if we would ever see you again.

359
00:39:22,417 --> 00:39:24,086
It's been so long.

360
00:39:25,504 --> 00:39:27,047
Did you have a good trip?

361
00:39:27,673 --> 00:39:28,965
Yeah, it was fine.

362
00:39:32,634 --> 00:39:33,551
Hunter.

363
00:39:46,063 --> 00:39:47,064
Hunter.

364
00:39:47,898 --> 00:39:49,191
This is Travis.

365
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:04,413
Hi.

366
00:40:07,542 --> 00:40:08,501
Hi.

367
00:40:18,509 --> 00:40:22,053
I bet it was really hot
coming across the Mohabis Desert.

368
00:40:25,222 --> 00:40:26,432
Yes.

369
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:28,600
Too bad you had to drive.

370
00:40:29,643 --> 00:40:31,061
What happened?

371
00:40:32,229 --> 00:40:34,815
Well, Travis just didn't feel like flying.

372
00:40:35,606 --> 00:40:37,191
Oh, I don't blame you.

373
00:40:37,191 --> 00:40:39,443
I can't stand airplanes anymore.

374
00:40:39,526 --> 00:40:41,361
Especially since we live in this house.

375
00:40:42,112 --> 00:40:45,325
All we hear is planes day in and day out.

376
00:40:45,575 --> 00:40:46,492
I like them.

377
00:40:54,999 --> 00:40:57,043
You used to fly, didn't you, Travis?

378
00:40:59,586 --> 00:41:00,878
No.

379
00:41:02,838 --> 00:41:06,175
Oh, I thought...
I remember

380
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:10,262
Jane telling me
that you flew once to Dallas together.

381
00:41:10,888 --> 00:41:12,307
Or somewhere.

382
00:41:15,476 --> 00:41:16,768
Maybe I'm mistaken.

383
00:41:37,577 --> 00:41:40,079
Honey.
He hasn't slept in a bed

384
00:41:40,454 --> 00:41:42,581
Since we started, I swear to God.

385
00:41:42,915 --> 00:41:44,833
I don't think that's even necessary.

386
00:41:45,293 --> 00:41:47,337
Where has he been sleeping then?

387
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:49,923
Well, he doesn't sleep.

388
00:41:50,715 --> 00:41:52,508
He has to sleep somewhere.

389
00:41:53,008 --> 00:41:54,009
OK.

390
00:41:54,509 --> 00:41:56,761
But I don't think he's even going to use it.

391
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:59,514
He's got to get tired sometime.

392
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:06,185
There is a towel for you, Travis,

393
00:42:06,394 --> 00:42:09,105
And some underwear and socks from Walt.

394
00:42:11,273 --> 00:42:12,400
Good night.

395
00:42:14,525 --> 00:42:15,651
Thank you.

396
00:42:20,489 --> 00:42:22,992
OK.
Get some shut eye.

397
00:42:23,617 --> 00:42:24,618
OK.

398
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,246
- Sweet dreams.
- Alright.

399
00:43:37,306 --> 00:43:38,807
You polished them.

400
00:43:41,518 --> 00:43:43,520
That's very nice of you Travis.

401
00:43:45,356 --> 00:43:47,774
Would you like to come in
and have some breakfast?

402
00:43:50,232 --> 00:43:51,442
Aren’t you hungry?

403
00:43:53,069 --> 00:43:55,404
We are going to have strawberry waffles.

404
00:43:56,239 --> 00:43:57,449
Do you like them?

405
00:43:58,823 --> 00:44:00,033
Do you want some?

406
00:44:09,918 --> 00:44:13,796
Well, there is hot coffee on the stove
if you want some.

407
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:18,133
Look at that truck.

408
00:44:56,709 --> 00:44:57,835
Hi.

409
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:35,492
Decided to rough it, huh?

410
00:45:35,659 --> 00:45:36,660
Yeah.

411
00:45:37,870 --> 00:45:39,580
What did you do, spit shine these?

412
00:45:39,996 --> 00:45:41,623
I can get you a job
at the airport doing that.

413
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,919
Do you want to trade these new boots
for those old boots?

414
00:45:49,046 --> 00:45:50,255
You can wear them.

415
00:45:52,839 --> 00:45:53,923
Thank you.

416
00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:26,078
Travis? I have to rush off
to get Hunter to school on time.

417
00:46:26,453 --> 00:46:28,246
We will be back this afternoon.

418
00:46:28,622 --> 00:46:31,498
Walt's office number is
on the dining room table.

419
00:46:32,290 --> 00:46:33,291
See you later.

420
00:46:34,292 --> 00:46:35,919
- OK.
- Bye.

421
00:47:10,072 --> 00:47:11,657
- Ann?
- Yeah?

422
00:47:11,865 --> 00:47:14,953
I was just thinking
maybe I can meet Hunter after school

423
00:47:15,036 --> 00:47:17,414
And we could walk home together,
if he wants to.

424
00:47:18,831 --> 00:47:20,416
That sounds like a great idea, Travis.

425
00:47:22,417 --> 00:47:25,878
Walk home?
I don't want to walk home mom.

426
00:47:27,213 --> 00:47:29,841
Why walk, everybody drives.

427
00:47:30,466 --> 00:47:31,718
Come on, Hunter

428
00:47:31,718 --> 00:47:33,971
It won't hurt you
once to walk home in your life.

429
00:47:34,387 --> 00:47:36,180
No, no, I don't want to.

430
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:40,225
Travis, I insist, you are Hunter's father.

431
00:47:43,395 --> 00:47:45,857
And get into the car Hunter.
We are late as it is.

432
00:47:50,901 --> 00:47:52,069
You are mean.

433
00:48:55,165 --> 00:48:57,668
- Can I come with you?
- Sure.

434
00:49:35,826 --> 00:49:38,120
I'm very sorry about this, Travis.

435
00:49:39,830 --> 00:49:41,705
It's not easy for him, Ann.

436
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:51,046
Ann, it's OK, he's in here.

437
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:00,723
What are you doing?

438
00:50:01,307 --> 00:50:02,308
Driving.

439
00:50:03,350 --> 00:50:04,393
Where to?

440
00:50:05,769 --> 00:50:06,978
Just driving.

441
00:50:07,979 --> 00:50:09,689
You're not hiding out in there, are you?

442
00:50:10,313 --> 00:50:11,314
No.

443
00:50:16,986 --> 00:50:19,528
Hunter. Travis is your real dad,

444
00:50:19,653 --> 00:50:20,571
You know that, don't you?

445
00:50:23,115 --> 00:50:25,451
Dad, when are they going to
make spaceships like they...

446
00:50:25,826 --> 00:50:27,286
Make cars?

447
00:50:29,830 --> 00:50:32,373
Hunter, I'm asking you a question.
Can you answer it?

448
00:50:33,374 --> 00:50:34,542
What?

449
00:50:37,962 --> 00:50:41,257
Well, Travis went to meet you at school,

450
00:50:41,549 --> 00:50:43,051
And he wanted to walk you home.

451
00:50:44,093 --> 00:50:45,719
Nobody walks.

452
00:50:47,179 --> 00:50:48,262
That's not the point.

453
00:50:49,639 --> 00:50:51,849
Travis is your real dad and...

454
00:50:52,183 --> 00:50:53,809
He wants to talk to you.

455
00:50:56,687 --> 00:50:58,647
Why? What about?

456
00:51:01,024 --> 00:51:02,944
OK, come on. Lets go have dinner.

457
00:51:13,994 --> 00:51:18,958
Hey Trav? Do you remember that time
when Ann and me came down
to visit you about 5 years ago?

458
00:51:22,211 --> 00:51:23,044
No.

459
00:51:24,003 --> 00:51:26,171
You and Jane were down in Texas,
right there on the coast.

460
00:51:27,339 --> 00:51:28,590
Hunter was about 3.

461
00:51:29,883 --> 00:51:30,926
Don't you remember that?

462
00:51:34,764 --> 00:51:35,763
No.

463
00:51:35,972 --> 00:51:37,974
I remember, we went fishing.

464
00:51:39,225 --> 00:51:40,309
Yeah.

465
00:51:41,602 --> 00:51:43,896
I took some Super Eight on that trip.
And I put it all together?

466
00:51:44,230 --> 00:51:45,604
Thought maybe you might
want to see some of it.

467
00:51:46,689 --> 00:51:47,815
What is it?

468
00:51:48,606 --> 00:51:50,066
Movies. You know, Super Eight?

469
00:51:50,858 --> 00:51:52,443
- Oh.
- Walt.

470
00:51:53,194 --> 00:51:55,154
Maybe Travis doesn't want...

471
00:51:56,447 --> 00:51:57,365
What?

472
00:51:59,117 --> 00:52:02,619
Well, maybe he'd like to wait a while
before he looks at it.

473
00:52:04,745 --> 00:52:05,913
Yeah, it's up to him.

474
00:52:06,622 --> 00:52:08,250
Just thought you might like to see some of it.

475
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:11,003
Movies? Sure.

476
00:52:11,253 --> 00:52:15,005
Great. There's some great stuff on it.
Some great shots of Hunter on it.

477
00:52:15,964 --> 00:52:17,173
I've already seen it.

478
00:52:17,841 --> 00:52:18,925
Well, you have to see it again.

479
00:52:20,135 --> 00:52:22,721
- Come on, help me set up the projector.
- OK.

480
00:53:51,214 --> 00:53:52,507
That’s me driving.

481
00:53:53,216 --> 00:53:54,884
I know, you are going to be good.

482
00:57:00,168 --> 00:57:01,880
Time for bed now, Hunter.

483
00:57:02,964 --> 00:57:05,049
Oh, mom.

484
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:07,384
Time to go to bed, it's past ten.

485
00:57:09,886 --> 00:57:11,971
- Good night dad.
- Good night baby.

486
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:19,435
Good night dad.

487
00:57:25,816 --> 00:57:27,735
Do you think he still loves her?

488
00:57:28,193 --> 00:57:30,153
How would I know that, Hunter?

489
00:57:31,278 --> 00:57:32,905
I think he does.

490
00:57:34,699 --> 00:57:35,825
How can you tell?

491
00:57:36,159 --> 00:57:37,952
Well, the way he looked at her.

492
00:57:38,536 --> 00:57:40,246
You mean when he saw her in the movie?

493
00:57:41,039 --> 00:57:43,374
Yeah, but that's not her.

494
00:57:44,041 --> 00:57:45,167
What do you mean?

495
00:57:46,794 --> 00:57:48,420
That's only her in a movie.

496
00:57:50,255 --> 00:57:51,757
A long time ago.

497
00:57:53,133 --> 00:57:55,427
In a galaxy far, far away.

498
00:58:33,209 --> 00:58:34,377
What are you looking for?

499
00:58:34,959 --> 00:58:37,211
I'm looking for a...

500
00:58:38,587 --> 00:58:39,505
The father.

501
00:58:39,881 --> 00:58:40,841
Your father?

502
00:58:41,216 --> 00:58:44,176
No, no, just a father.
Any father.

503
00:58:44,552 --> 00:58:46,136
What does a father look like?

504
00:58:46,762 --> 00:58:48,847
There are many different kinds of fathers,
senior Travis.

505
00:58:49,556 --> 00:58:51,641
Well, I just need one.

506
00:58:52,016 --> 00:58:53,268
You think you are going to find him in there?

507
00:58:53,601 --> 00:58:55,103
Well, I don't know where else to look.

508
00:58:55,812 --> 00:58:58,439
Oh, I see, you want too look like a father.

509
00:58:59,816 --> 00:59:00,816
Yeah.

510
00:59:02,067 --> 00:59:05,194
Tell me, do you want to be a rich father?

511
00:59:07,196 --> 00:59:08,155
No.

512
00:59:08,447 --> 00:59:10,074
- A poor one?
- No.

513
00:59:11,492 --> 00:59:12,661
Than which?

514
00:59:13,076 --> 00:59:13,994
In between.

515
00:59:13,994 --> 00:59:16,580
No, no. There is no in between, eh?

516
00:59:16,872 --> 00:59:18,957
You either have to be a rich father
or a poor one.

517
00:59:19,332 --> 00:59:20,625
Rich.

518
00:59:37,098 --> 00:59:38,682
One thing you must remember.

519
00:59:38,932 --> 00:59:42,684
To be a rich father, senior Travis,
you must look to the sky,

520
00:59:42,851 --> 00:59:44,186
Never to the ground.

521
00:59:46,439 --> 00:59:47,648
Little higher.

522
00:59:56,238 --> 00:59:58,073
No... Stand.

523
00:59:58,991 --> 01:00:00,867
You must walk stiff, senior Travis.

524
01:00:10,417 --> 01:00:11,668
Dignity.

525
01:00:28,518 --> 01:00:29,725
You got it.

526
01:00:50,244 --> 01:00:52,288
Who is that guy, you know him?

527
01:00:53,289 --> 01:00:55,332
Yeah, he's my father's brother.

528
01:00:58,125 --> 01:01:02,255
No... they are both brothers.

529
01:01:02,338 --> 01:01:05,591
No, they are both fathers.

530
01:01:07,925 --> 01:01:09,885
No... ah, forget it.

531
01:01:10,261 --> 01:01:12,681
- But both who's fathers?
- My father.

532
01:01:13,598 --> 01:01:15,350
How they have two fathers?

533
01:01:15,517 --> 01:01:17,058
Just lucky I guess.

534
01:01:18,726 --> 01:01:20,310
- Well, bye.
- Bye.

535
01:03:12,826 --> 01:03:14,159
That's my dad's suite.

536
01:03:16,078 --> 01:03:17,287
I mean Walt.

537
01:03:17,621 --> 01:03:19,540
That's OK if you call him dad.

538
01:03:20,707 --> 01:03:23,377
Yeah, I borrowed it from him.
He said it was OK.

539
01:03:29,132 --> 01:03:30,590
What are those pictures?

540
01:03:31,550 --> 01:03:32,884
That's my dad.

541
01:03:34,637 --> 01:03:36,055
And your grandfather.

542
01:03:39,932 --> 01:03:41,142
What was his name?

543
01:03:42,143 --> 01:03:43,227
Travis.

544
01:03:43,352 --> 01:03:44,937
Same as yours.

545
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:47,523
Where is he now?

546
01:03:49,232 --> 01:03:50,525
He died...

547
01:03:51,442 --> 01:03:53,443
A couple of years after this picture.

548
01:03:54,111 --> 01:03:55,362
In that car.

549
01:03:55,737 --> 01:03:57,656
- Oh, he's dead?
- Uh huh.

550
01:03:59,241 --> 01:04:01,452
But can you feel that he's dead?

551
01:04:02,161 --> 01:04:03,287
What do you mean?

552
01:04:03,912 --> 01:04:05,538
You knew him
when he was walking around

553
01:04:05,663 --> 01:04:08,291
- And talking. Right?
- Yeah.

554
01:04:08,875 --> 01:04:11,127
So can you feel that he is gone?

555
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:15,590
Yeah, sometimes.
I know he's dead.

556
01:04:18,007 --> 01:04:19,967
I never felt like you were dead.

557
01:04:20,301 --> 01:04:21,802
I could always feel you were walking

558
01:04:21,886 --> 01:04:25,014
Around and talking... some place.

559
01:04:25,806 --> 01:04:27,473
I feel mom too.

560
01:04:28,056 --> 01:04:30,266
- You do?
- Don't you?

561
01:04:31,601 --> 01:04:32,768
Yeah.

562
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:38,150
That's me when I was in the navy.

563
01:04:39,485 --> 01:04:40,653
You were a general?

564
01:04:40,945 --> 01:04:44,198
No... This was when I was in the band.

565
01:04:44,990 --> 01:04:46,240
The high school band.

566
01:04:48,493 --> 01:04:52,038
This is you. I like this picture.
Look at that.

567
01:04:53,039 --> 01:04:54,040
That is really wild.

568
01:04:54,373 --> 01:04:57,291
That's weird when it,
when there is water in between

569
01:04:57,291 --> 01:05:00,252
And then it turns into nothing.

570
01:05:01,879 --> 01:05:03,088
That's a great picture.

571
01:05:04,298 --> 01:05:05,757
And this is my mom.

572
01:05:07,675 --> 01:05:08,717
Your grandmother.

573
01:05:14,432 --> 01:05:15,475
I didn't know.

574
01:05:19,521 --> 01:05:20,688
It just seems that...

575
01:05:21,063 --> 01:05:24,066
Everything has changed between us so fast.

576
01:05:24,149 --> 01:05:26,275
Ever since Travis came.

577
01:05:26,567 --> 01:05:27,777
What's changed?

578
01:05:29,946 --> 01:05:31,155
I'm just afraid.

579
01:05:32,949 --> 01:05:34,323
Afraid of Travis?

580
01:05:35,157 --> 01:05:36,117
No...

581
01:05:36,992 --> 01:05:38,494
Then what?

582
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:43,790
Of what will happen to us if we loose Hunter.

583
01:05:47,544 --> 01:05:49,045
We're not going to loose Hunter.

584
01:05:49,420 --> 01:05:52,090
Then why do you keep pushing them together?

585
01:05:52,799 --> 01:05:55,426
It's almost as if you wanted them to leave.

586
01:05:56,010 --> 01:05:58,388
- Who?
- Hunter.

587
01:05:59,638 --> 01:06:01,807
You know what I'm talking about.

588
01:06:02,182 --> 01:06:05,392
You keep promoting this
father son business between...

589
01:06:05,851 --> 01:06:07,352
It's not business.

590
01:06:08,270 --> 01:06:11,565
Travis is his father,
and Hunter is his son.

591
01:06:12,522 --> 01:06:13,773
That's a fact.

592
01:06:14,315 --> 01:06:15,859
You've known that all along.

593
01:06:17,527 --> 01:06:19,363
Travis happens to be my brother.

594
01:06:19,697 --> 01:06:20,781
I know he is.

595
01:06:21,115 --> 01:06:23,199
Well, what's this promotion bull shit?

596
01:06:23,533 --> 01:06:25,033
You want us to go on pretending...

597
01:06:25,367 --> 01:06:27,828
That we are the parents
of my brother's son?

598
01:06:28,537 --> 01:06:30,289
Well, how long do you want Hunter
to buy that?

599
01:06:30,622 --> 01:06:32,875
I was never pretending.

600
01:06:33,167 --> 01:06:37,004
I love him, just like
he was my own flesh and blood.

601
01:06:38,588 --> 01:06:39,797
So do I.

602
01:06:50,555 --> 01:06:51,640
Hi Ann.

603
01:06:52,141 --> 01:06:53,225
Hi Travis.

604
01:06:53,934 --> 01:06:55,895
You don't sleep much, do you?

605
01:07:05,903 --> 01:07:07,196
Travis.

606
01:07:08,447 --> 01:07:10,491
There is something I have to tell you.

607
01:07:10,824 --> 01:07:12,493
I was not going to,

608
01:07:12,826 --> 01:07:16,329
Because somehow it makes things easier
that nobody knows.

609
01:07:17,455 --> 01:07:20,290
I never even told Walt, or Hunter.

610
01:07:22,042 --> 01:07:23,210
What is it?

611
01:07:26,255 --> 01:07:28,798
After Hunter came to live with us,

612
01:07:29,548 --> 01:07:30,966
Jane used to call.

613
01:07:32,635 --> 01:07:34,512
Asking about him.

614
01:07:35,012 --> 01:07:39,139
She made me promise not to tell anyone
that she was calling.

615
01:07:39,556 --> 01:07:41,099
Did she ask about me?

616
01:07:43,935 --> 01:07:46,521
Yes. In the beginning.

617
01:07:50,733 --> 01:07:52,151
Where did she call from?

618
01:07:53,527 --> 01:07:55,195
Places in Texas.

619
01:07:55,529 --> 01:07:56,947
What places?

620
01:08:00,868 --> 01:08:02,370
Let me finish, Travis.

621
01:08:05,456 --> 01:08:08,499
After what happened
between you and Jane...

622
01:08:09,834 --> 01:08:12,628
She decided Hunter should be with us.

623
01:08:14,213 --> 01:08:17,006
She said she couldn't be a mother to him anymore.

624
01:08:25,180 --> 01:08:28,183
She stopped being a mother to him
a long time before that.

625
01:08:41,229 --> 01:08:43,898
Travis. I don't want to feel I'm...

626
01:08:44,065 --> 01:08:46,402
Hiding something from you anymore.

627
01:08:52,242 --> 01:08:53,493
She was young...

628
01:08:59,500 --> 01:09:00,710
She wanted something,

629
01:09:00,835 --> 01:09:03,088
But I just couldn't figure out what it was.

630
01:09:10,138 --> 01:09:12,850
I just didn't realize how much rage I had.

631
01:09:21,735 --> 01:09:24,529
A little more than a year ago
she stopped calling.

632
01:09:25,114 --> 01:09:27,200
I haven't heard from her since then.

633
01:09:28,868 --> 01:09:29,869
Nothing?

634
01:09:31,538 --> 01:09:32,539
Not a word.

635
01:09:33,999 --> 01:09:35,585
But on the last call,

636
01:09:37,170 --> 01:09:40,216
She asked for me
to open a bank account for Hunter.

637
01:09:42,009 --> 01:09:43,427
A bank account?

638
01:09:43,552 --> 01:09:46,098
All I know about Jane now is...

639
01:09:47,099 --> 01:09:48,809
She goes to this bank.

640
01:09:49,392 --> 01:09:51,645
On the 5th of each month...

641
01:09:52,313 --> 01:09:54,315
And wires money for Hunter.

642
01:09:59,029 --> 01:10:01,115
Jane, still sends him money.

643
01:10:02,616 --> 01:10:06,996
Sometimes a hundred dollars,
sometimes 50, or 5...

644
01:10:07,998 --> 01:10:09,667
For Hunter's future.

645
01:10:10,584 --> 01:10:12,838
I had the bank trace the wire.

646
01:10:14,172 --> 01:10:15,882
It comes from a bank in Huston.

647
01:10:16,508 --> 01:10:17,884
What bank?

648
01:10:19,303 --> 01:10:22,098
I wrote it down if you want it.

649
01:10:25,436 --> 01:10:26,770
What's the date today?

650
01:10:27,312 --> 01:10:28,939
The first of November.

651
01:10:34,696 --> 01:10:37,449
I don't think we should do that. You're right.

652
01:10:40,954 --> 01:10:42,581
I meant the other thing.

653
01:11:02,479 --> 01:11:06,692
You will all be caught
with your diapers down.

654
01:11:07,067 --> 01:11:08,694
That is a promise!

655
01:11:09,236 --> 01:11:13,201
I give you this promise on my mother's head!

656
01:11:13,743 --> 01:11:19,458
For right here today,
standing on the very head of my mother.

657
01:11:19,750 --> 01:11:22,419
Which is how a god treats her.

658
01:11:22,836 --> 01:11:26,467
Which everybody who wasn't bought
in a fucking store.

659
01:11:26,801 --> 01:11:31,222
Wanna know and understand
to the very letter what death holds.

660
01:11:33,058 --> 01:11:35,685
They will invade you in your beds,

661
01:11:36,561 --> 01:11:39,357
They will snap you from your hot tubs.

662
01:11:40,399 --> 01:11:44,445
They will pluck you right
out of your expensive sports cars.

663
01:11:45,238 --> 01:11:47,450
There is no where.

664
01:11:49,452 --> 01:11:51,121
Absolutely no where...

665
01:11:51,621 --> 01:11:54,166
In this God forsaken valley.

666
01:11:55,126 --> 01:11:59,756
I'm talking about from the rage
of my voice right here...

667
01:12:00,090 --> 01:12:03,260
Clear out to the goddamn
Mojave desert.

668
01:12:03,635 --> 01:12:07,515
And beyond that.
Clear up this mess though.

669
01:12:09,267 --> 01:12:12,478
For everywhere else in the valley
always had a sona.

670
01:12:13,689 --> 01:12:16,775
None of that area will be
called the safety zone.

671
01:12:17,443 --> 01:12:19,530
There will be no safety zone.

672
01:12:19,864 --> 01:12:21,782
I can guarantee this safety zone...

673
01:12:21,866 --> 01:12:23,617
Will be eliminated,

674
01:12:23,784 --> 01:12:25,327
Eradicated.

675
01:12:26,163 --> 01:12:30,750
You will all be exerdited
to the land of no return.

676
01:12:31,585 --> 01:12:34,130
It's eradication to no where.

677
01:12:34,839 --> 01:12:37,383
And if you think that's going to be fun,

678
01:12:37,925 --> 01:12:40,053
You've got another thing coming.

679
01:12:42,222 --> 01:12:44,391
They made me a slime bucket.

680
01:12:44,766 --> 01:12:48,938
But believe me,
I know what the hell I'm talking about.

681
01:12:49,606 --> 01:12:51,150
I'm not crazy.

682
01:12:51,901 --> 01:12:55,864
And don't say I didn't warn you.
I warned you.

683
01:12:56,281 --> 01:12:57,866
I warned all of you.

684
01:13:09,338 --> 01:13:11,089
Thought you were afraid of heights.

685
01:13:11,757 --> 01:13:14,385
No, I'm not afraid of heights,
I'm afraid of falling.

686
01:13:15,178 --> 01:13:16,930
Oh, yeah? Well then just don't look down.

687
01:13:20,643 --> 01:13:23,312
To bad the things don't look
the same on the ground.

688
01:13:24,189 --> 01:13:25,232
What do you mean?

689
01:13:27,527 --> 01:13:28,945
Things are clearer up here.

690
01:13:30,488 --> 01:13:31,989
Might clear things up.

691
01:13:32,156 --> 01:13:34,660
Yeah, I had a talk with Ann last night.

692
01:13:35,452 --> 01:13:36,954
Yeah, she is pretty upset.

693
01:13:38,121 --> 01:13:39,331
Yeah, I know.

694
01:13:41,417 --> 01:13:42,377
I'm going to leave.

695
01:13:43,086 --> 01:13:45,088
- What?
- I'm leaving.

696
01:13:45,964 --> 01:13:49,426
I didn't tell you this in order to make you leave.
I'm not trying to get rid of you, Travis.

697
01:13:49,552 --> 01:13:51,846
- I know that.
- Well, what good is that going to do?

698
01:13:51,846 --> 01:13:53,598
- I wanna...
- That's not going to solve anything.

699
01:13:54,516 --> 01:13:56,434
I'm going to go find Jane.

700
01:13:57,979 --> 01:13:59,272
How you going to do that?

701
01:13:59,857 --> 01:14:02,025
It's been four years.
She's completely disappeared.

702
01:14:02,401 --> 01:14:04,278
I tried to find her, I tried everything,
I couldn't find her.

703
01:14:04,611 --> 01:14:07,157
Now, I haven't tried yet.
I can find her.

704
01:14:07,323 --> 01:14:08,283
What make's you so sure?

705
01:14:08,616 --> 01:14:10,034
Oh, I just know.

706
01:14:10,702 --> 01:14:11,911
Can we go down now?

707
01:14:12,036 --> 01:14:15,541
No! God damn it!

708
01:14:15,875 --> 01:14:18,210
You tell me what happened Travis!

709
01:14:18,627 --> 01:14:20,088
I'm sick of this fucking mystery!

710
01:14:20,464 --> 01:14:22,090
I've been treating you
like a spoiled kid...

711
01:14:22,174 --> 01:14:23,758
Ever since I picked you up in the desert.

712
01:14:24,092 --> 01:14:26,929
Now you tell me what happened,
with you and Jane!

713
01:14:27,972 --> 01:14:28,806
Shit!

714
01:14:30,434 --> 01:14:32,519
I know it's none of my business.

715
01:14:33,980 --> 01:14:36,816
Uh, well, I need to take...

716
01:14:38,026 --> 01:14:40,154
Money, credit cards.

717
01:14:40,654 --> 01:14:42,239
Alright, sure, you can have them.

718
01:14:42,406 --> 01:14:43,532
You know you'll get it back.

719
01:14:43,824 --> 01:14:45,367
Oh, forget that. You can have them.

720
01:14:45,910 --> 01:14:47,204
I want to find her, Walt.

721
01:15:13,401 --> 01:15:14,570
Hunter!

722
01:15:24,581 --> 01:15:25,874
That your car?

723
01:15:29,838 --> 01:15:32,340
Yup! Come on!

724
01:15:34,093 --> 01:15:35,303
Radical.

725
01:15:49,153 --> 01:15:50,904
This is not bad stuff.

726
01:15:52,906 --> 01:15:54,909
Ann puts it in lunch everyday.

727
01:15:55,243 --> 01:15:58,204
Lavash, Ki, Ri. Sticky.

728
01:15:58,496 --> 01:15:59,873
Lavash, what?

729
01:16:02,042 --> 01:16:03,627
Ri, Rrrr, Ri.

730
01:16:04,211 --> 01:16:05,629
Ri, Rrrr, Ri.

731
01:16:07,089 --> 01:16:08,467
I like it.

732
01:16:10,678 --> 01:16:12,346
- Dad.
- Yap?

733
01:16:12,930 --> 01:16:14,600
Where did you go all that time?

734
01:16:18,061 --> 01:16:19,313
Mexico.

735
01:16:19,938 --> 01:16:21,357
How come?

736
01:16:23,193 --> 01:16:24,903
I didn't know where else to go.

737
01:16:27,238 --> 01:16:28,532
Where did mom go?

738
01:16:30,451 --> 01:16:31,494
I don't know.

739
01:16:32,453 --> 01:16:34,079
But right now, she is somewhere in Huston.

740
01:16:34,706 --> 01:16:36,458
That's where the space center is.

741
01:16:40,421 --> 01:16:42,508
And that's what I wanted to talk to you about.

742
01:16:43,509 --> 01:16:44,801
I have to go away now.

743
01:16:45,511 --> 01:16:46,470
Why?

744
01:16:47,597 --> 01:16:48,848
Because I'm going to find her.

745
01:16:49,098 --> 01:16:52,227
What about me, you just found me.
Can I come with?

746
01:16:57,399 --> 01:16:58,442
What about Walt and Ann?

747
01:16:59,485 --> 01:17:01,363
We would never come back here?

748
01:17:01,738 --> 01:17:02,989
Sure, but...

749
01:17:04,157 --> 01:17:05,158
I don't know when.

750
01:17:15,296 --> 01:17:16,548
I want to come with.

751
01:17:19,634 --> 01:17:21,512
I want to find her too.

752
01:17:22,137 --> 01:17:23,389
When do we go?

753
01:17:28,812 --> 01:17:29,813
Right now.

754
01:17:30,230 --> 01:17:31,773
Then, come on, lets go.

755
01:17:32,440 --> 01:17:35,027
First we have to stop
to get supplies for the trip.

756
01:17:35,111 --> 01:17:35,945
OK.

757
01:17:51,589 --> 01:17:53,340
We got to buy jackets, tee shirts,

758
01:17:53,340 --> 01:17:55,385
Tooth brushes, stuff like that.

759
01:17:55,510 --> 01:17:57,387
Maybe even walky talkies.

760
01:17:57,888 --> 01:17:59,347
Talkies of course.

761
01:17:59,973 --> 01:18:01,057
Just in case.

762
01:18:10,861 --> 01:18:12,196
Do you know what?

763
01:18:12,654 --> 01:18:13,697
What?

764
01:18:15,284 --> 01:18:18,747
This whole galaxy, the whole universe...

765
01:18:19,080 --> 01:18:22,877
Used to be compressed
into a tiny spot this big.

766
01:18:23,794 --> 01:18:26,297
- And you know what happened?
- What?

767
01:18:27,131 --> 01:18:29,676
It went "Phchue..."
and blew up.

768
01:18:30,052 --> 01:18:33,347
All the spark, flying every place,

769
01:18:33,639 --> 01:18:35,475
In space...

770
01:18:36,351 --> 01:18:38,269
It was just gas. It was flowing around.

771
01:18:38,645 --> 01:18:39,646
The earth was?

772
01:18:39,979 --> 01:18:41,982
Yeah, the earth was really gas.

773
01:18:42,358 --> 01:18:45,736
And the sun formed, and it was so hot...

774
01:18:46,028 --> 01:18:50,534
That the earth just formed
into one hard ball.

775
01:18:50,992 --> 01:18:53,663
Of ocean. Nothing but ocean.

776
01:18:54,455 --> 01:18:56,416
So there was sea animals and...

777
01:18:56,458 --> 01:19:00,170
Under the water,
a volcano went..."Pachooo"

778
01:19:01,004 --> 01:19:03,341
And... The hot lava hit the water...

779
01:19:03,424 --> 01:19:06,427
And formed rock to make land.

780
01:19:18,650 --> 01:19:20,735
If you want to make a collect call,

781
01:19:21,027 --> 01:19:22,864
You dial the operator and tell her that...

782
01:19:22,989 --> 01:19:24,074
I know.

783
01:19:24,449 --> 01:19:26,827
Good, then call Walt and Ann.

784
01:19:27,202 --> 01:19:28,161
Why?

785
01:19:28,746 --> 01:19:30,582
Because, so they don't worry about you,

786
01:19:30,623 --> 01:19:31,708
So they know where you are.

787
01:19:32,083 --> 01:19:33,668
But what am I going to say?

788
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:35,044
Just tell them the truth.

789
01:19:35,421 --> 01:19:38,799
Tell them that you are with me,
and on to Texas.

790
01:19:39,592 --> 01:19:41,135
They are going to flip out.

791
01:19:41,468 --> 01:19:44,139
No... but you can handle it.

792
01:19:44,264 --> 01:19:45,348
OK?

793
01:19:45,599 --> 01:19:47,058
Why can't you do it?

794
01:19:47,434 --> 01:19:48,978
I can't do it.

795
01:19:50,396 --> 01:19:51,480
Why?

796
01:19:51,606 --> 01:19:53,858
Because it has to be you.

797
01:19:56,821 --> 01:19:59,324
Oh, jeez...

798
01:19:59,741 --> 01:20:01,701
Why can't he do anything?

799
01:20:07,917 --> 01:20:09,502
- Hello.
- Hi dad.

800
01:20:09,711 --> 01:20:11,254
Hunter. Where are you?

801
01:20:11,588 --> 01:20:14,090
You know what time it is?
I've been calling everywhere looking for you.

802
01:20:17,845 --> 01:20:20,306
Yeah, yeah. Hunter, just listen to me now.

803
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:22,809
Where are you, exactly?

804
01:20:25,437 --> 01:20:27,022
St. Vernidino?

805
01:20:27,481 --> 01:20:30,444
Hunter, what do you mean
you are in St. Vernidino?

806
01:20:30,986 --> 01:20:31,862
Wait a minute honey.

807
01:20:32,029 --> 01:20:33,697
- How did...
- Let me talk to him.

808
01:20:34,907 --> 01:20:36,034
Hunter.

809
01:20:36,826 --> 01:20:38,245
Are you alright?

810
01:20:38,453 --> 01:20:39,538
Yeah.

811
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:41,581
What are you doing?

812
01:20:44,001 --> 01:20:45,753
With Travis?

813
01:20:48,381 --> 01:20:49,967
Why are you going?

814
01:20:52,719 --> 01:20:56,516
Tell me where you are Hunter.
Just tell me where you are.

815
01:20:58,518 --> 01:21:00,228
What's the name of it?

816
01:21:01,688 --> 01:21:02,774
Oh, my god.

817
01:21:04,150 --> 01:21:05,068
Hunter.

818
01:21:05,944 --> 01:21:08,530
You tell Travis, to turn around...

819
01:21:08,863 --> 01:21:11,450
And come back right now.

820
01:21:11,867 --> 01:21:13,327
Do you understand me?

821
01:21:14,287 --> 01:21:15,454
Let me talk to him.

822
01:21:16,832 --> 01:21:18,292
What should I do?

823
01:21:19,251 --> 01:21:21,044
Just hang up.

824
01:21:23,798 --> 01:21:25,717
Bye mom. Got to go now.

825
01:21:28,136 --> 01:21:29,137
Hunter...?

826
01:21:30,806 --> 01:21:32,057
Hunter!

827
01:21:49,496 --> 01:21:50,497
Did they flip out?

828
01:21:50,873 --> 01:21:52,124
Yeah, she did.

829
01:21:52,750 --> 01:21:54,585
You're not sorry you came, are you?

830
01:21:54,668 --> 01:21:55,544
No.

831
01:21:55,920 --> 01:21:58,673
Well, you can go back to them
any time you want.

832
01:21:59,049 --> 01:22:00,091
You just tell me, OK?

833
01:22:00,425 --> 01:22:01,927
I don't want to go back.

834
01:22:03,054 --> 01:22:05,640
Well, I know, but just in case
you change your mind.

835
01:22:52,028 --> 01:22:54,489
I'm so used to calling her mom.

836
01:22:56,784 --> 01:22:58,077
Ann?

837
01:22:58,828 --> 01:22:59,704
Yeah.

838
01:23:04,918 --> 01:23:07,212
She sounded so sad.

839
01:23:10,341 --> 01:23:11,467
I know.

840
01:23:15,598 --> 01:23:18,059
What do you think mom will look like now?

841
01:23:22,898 --> 01:23:24,150
I don't know.

842
01:23:27,486 --> 01:23:28,946
Do you remember her?

843
01:23:30,032 --> 01:23:33,785
Not really.
Only from that little movie we saw.

844
01:23:43,505 --> 01:23:44,798
You look happy then.

845
01:23:46,301 --> 01:23:47,260
Yeah.

846
01:23:54,101 --> 01:23:55,561
You can keep that.

847
01:24:13,749 --> 01:24:14,708
Night.

848
01:24:56,592 --> 01:25:01,514
Dad, if a guy put a baby down,

849
01:25:01,514 --> 01:25:04,728
Traveled at the speed of light
for an hour,

850
01:25:05,312 --> 01:25:07,480
If he traveled at the speed of light,

851
01:25:07,814 --> 01:25:10,610
He would come back in an hour,

852
01:25:10,901 --> 01:25:12,236
He would be an hour older,

853
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:15,489
But the little baby would be a very old man.

854
01:25:17,241 --> 01:25:18,535
Oh, yeah?

855
01:25:18,660 --> 01:25:21,079
So, how long would it take him
to get to Huston?

856
01:25:24,250 --> 01:25:26,795
Ah, if they were to travel...

857
01:25:27,504 --> 01:25:29,465
I would say about 3 seconds.

858
01:25:31,384 --> 01:25:34,012
Ah, over, I didn't get that last part.

859
01:25:35,764 --> 01:25:37,516
It would take them 3 seconds...

860
01:25:37,850 --> 01:25:39,727
To get from California to Huston.

861
01:25:40,811 --> 01:25:42,521
At light speed.

862
01:25:51,157 --> 01:25:53,451
- This is Huston?
- Yup.

863
01:25:53,993 --> 01:25:56,955
How are we going to find her
in a big city like this?

864
01:25:57,331 --> 01:25:59,626
- I know where she'll be.
- Where?

865
01:26:00,085 --> 01:26:03,630
A bank. She's going to deposit
some money at a certain bank today.

866
01:26:07,176 --> 01:26:08,678
This is a bank?

867
01:26:09,428 --> 01:26:11,348
What kind of a bank is this?

868
01:26:12,015 --> 01:26:13,475
Looks like a drive in.

869
01:26:13,809 --> 01:26:16,061
I've never seen a bank like that.

870
01:26:17,062 --> 01:26:18,398
Me neither.

871
01:26:19,315 --> 01:26:22,402
There are so many cars...
We'll never find her.

872
01:26:22,735 --> 01:26:24,822
Oh, yeah, we will. Come on.

873
01:26:25,155 --> 01:26:28,033
We will split up and then
we will cover more ground. OK?

874
01:26:28,909 --> 01:26:31,080
Yeah, we could use the walky talkies.

875
01:26:31,414 --> 01:26:33,291
Hey, now you're going.

876
01:26:33,624 --> 01:26:35,835
- I'll let you out here.
- OK.

877
01:26:43,010 --> 01:26:44,846
Can you hear me dad? Over.

878
01:26:45,555 --> 01:26:47,056
Loud and clear.

879
01:26:48,850 --> 01:26:49,684
Good.

880
01:27:15,214 --> 01:27:16,758
Hunter in position one. Over.

881
01:27:17,842 --> 01:27:20,596
Travis in position two.
We got it covered.

882
01:27:21,555 --> 01:27:23,891
I told you it would be
more than a toy. Over.

883
01:27:24,224 --> 01:27:26,102
Ten four. Over and out.

884
01:29:06,472 --> 01:29:08,891
Dad, she is just leaving the building.

885
01:29:09,266 --> 01:29:10,434
Get over here.

886
01:29:10,768 --> 01:29:13,606
Dad, can you hear me?
Can you hear me?

887
01:29:18,402 --> 01:29:21,948
She's leaving the building.
Get over here!

888
01:29:22,866 --> 01:29:24,326
Dad!

889
01:29:24,743 --> 01:29:26,120
Come on!

890
01:29:26,621 --> 01:29:29,123
Dad! Wake up!

891
01:29:29,749 --> 01:29:32,670
Wake up! She is leaving the bank.

892
01:29:33,629 --> 01:29:35,214
Dad! Wake up!

893
01:29:36,715 --> 01:29:39,344
Wh... Where is... duh...

894
01:29:40,095 --> 01:29:41,721
I'm on my way.

895
01:29:42,555 --> 01:29:43,765
Oh, no.

896
01:30:03,580 --> 01:30:05,207
She went that way!

897
01:30:06,001 --> 01:30:07,502
Which way did she go?

898
01:30:07,877 --> 01:30:09,462
Hunter! Come on!

899
01:30:28,402 --> 01:30:31,572
Hunter, did you really
get a good look at her, or what?

900
01:30:31,947 --> 01:30:34,451
It was the right one,
I know it was her.

901
01:30:34,576 --> 01:30:36,619
Oh, god. We have lost her.

902
01:30:37,078 --> 01:30:39,457
Can this piece of junk go faster?

903
01:30:41,250 --> 01:30:43,627
There are 10 thousand cars here,
how are we going to find it?

904
01:30:43,753 --> 01:30:44,712
I don't know which one is it.

905
01:30:45,087 --> 01:30:46,631
Go faster dad, go faster.

906
01:30:46,965 --> 01:30:49,343
Hunter, what color...
the car was red, right?

907
01:30:49,676 --> 01:30:52,263
Yeah, a little red Chevy.

908
01:30:57,144 --> 01:30:59,522
Do you see anything?
I don't know what it looks like.

909
01:30:59,814 --> 01:31:01,941
You'll have to help me look,
can you see it?

910
01:31:02,192 --> 01:31:03,818
No, not yet.

911
01:31:06,238 --> 01:31:08,824
- I see it! I see it!
- Where, where?

912
01:31:09,700 --> 01:31:11,869
Over in that lane, in that lane!

913
01:31:11,994 --> 01:31:13,121
Which, which lane?

914
01:31:13,455 --> 01:31:16,583
- The right one!
- Alright, settle down, I see it.

915
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:23,841
See if it's her. Can you tell?

916
01:31:25,594 --> 01:31:27,430
I can't tell.

917
01:31:27,722 --> 01:31:29,808
Wait a minute, there's two red cars now.

918
01:31:30,600 --> 01:31:31,893
Which one is it?

919
01:31:33,354 --> 01:31:34,855
Ah, the right!
The left one!

920
01:31:35,314 --> 01:31:37,483
- You sure?
- Yeah, the left one.

921
01:31:44,157 --> 01:31:46,494
- You sure this is the one though.
- Yeah.

922
01:31:51,666 --> 01:31:56,673
I hope you are right Hunter,
if we are following the wrong car,
we are going to wait a whole another month.

923
01:31:57,132 --> 01:31:58,092
I'll be eight then.

924
01:31:58,509 --> 01:31:59,427
You'll be what?

925
01:31:59,761 --> 01:32:01,430
I'll be eight then.

926
01:32:07,145 --> 01:32:09,313
Lets get closer, we can wave.

927
01:32:09,480 --> 01:32:13,527
No, no... we don't want to get too close.
We might scare her,

928
01:32:13,527 --> 01:32:15,070
She'll have a wreck or something.

929
01:32:17,031 --> 01:32:19,742
- OK?
- OK. I guess so.

930
01:32:30,213 --> 01:32:33,718
Well, I wonder where she is going.

931
01:32:34,177 --> 01:32:36,429
Maybe to work.
What do you think?

932
01:32:37,430 --> 01:32:38,931
Yeah, could be.

933
01:33:50,891 --> 01:33:52,643
Looks like a girls car to me.

934
01:33:53,310 --> 01:33:54,855
Could it be hers?

935
01:33:57,149 --> 01:33:59,735
Could be... get in the truck
and I'll tell you my plan.

936
01:33:59,818 --> 01:34:00,611
OK.

937
01:34:09,456 --> 01:34:12,625
Roll the windows up, lock the doors,
and if anybody talks to you,

938
01:34:12,625 --> 01:34:16,464
Tell them your daddy’s inside
and he'll be right back. OK?

939
01:34:16,464 --> 01:34:17,256
OK.

940
01:34:17,840 --> 01:34:19,300
- You OK?
- Yap.

941
01:34:48,043 --> 01:34:52,589
Sergeant Jojo, call for you, booth 22.
Sergeant Jojo, booth 22.

942
01:34:53,090 --> 01:34:55,635
Come in, no bets,
you guys are going to love this.

943
01:34:55,802 --> 01:34:58,096
The girls here spend so much time
with a guy that...

944
01:34:58,346 --> 01:34:59,680
Most of them live alone.

945
01:34:59,847 --> 01:35:01,850
But it's tough to live alone in a city like this.

946
01:35:01,934 --> 01:35:03,477
A lot of violent things happen here.

947
01:35:04,103 --> 01:35:06,271
Stuff like rape, like murder,

948
01:35:06,522 --> 01:35:08,441
That's why we have a police force.

949
01:36:08,472 --> 01:36:09,556
Sir?

950
01:36:11,725 --> 01:36:13,310
Sir, you are in the wrong place.

951
01:36:15,521 --> 01:36:17,607
It's too early, all the girls are downstairs.

952
01:36:22,030 --> 01:36:24,574
Please get a ride, cus I'm getting crazy.

953
01:38:21,836 --> 01:38:23,089
Yeah, who do you want?

954
01:38:23,422 --> 01:38:27,927
Yeah, I want to see a blond girl
with kinda short straight hair, about 25 years old.

955
01:38:28,887 --> 01:38:29,846
OK.

956
01:38:30,348 --> 01:38:32,558
She's coming down,
stay on the line.

957
01:38:51,581 --> 01:38:52,582
Hello honey.

958
01:38:55,001 --> 01:38:56,421
Oh, mercy.

959
01:38:56,838 --> 01:39:00,842
You know, 23, I work 23
of the 24 bids in this place,

960
01:39:03,680 --> 01:39:05,223
unless I make 24.

961
01:39:06,850 --> 01:39:08,852
What can I do for you today?

962
01:39:10,938 --> 01:39:12,231
I have an idea.

963
01:39:12,982 --> 01:39:14,525
How about water polo?

964
01:39:16,611 --> 01:39:17,821
Fun.

965
01:39:20,365 --> 01:39:21,825
Oh, well...

966
01:39:22,535 --> 01:39:23,661
Tell you what.

967
01:39:24,036 --> 01:39:26,706
Why don't you just tell nurse Piffs
what your pain is.

968
01:39:26,831 --> 01:39:28,207
Maybe I can find a cure... hmm?

969
01:39:28,499 --> 01:39:30,169
Well, why don't you look at me?

970
01:39:30,502 --> 01:39:32,045
I am looking at you.

971
01:39:32,337 --> 01:39:35,174
Yeah, but I'm over here,
can't you see me?

972
01:39:35,466 --> 01:39:38,721
Listen sweet heart, if I can see you,
I wouldn't be working here.

973
01:39:39,638 --> 01:39:41,724
Well, what do you see?

974
01:39:43,185 --> 01:39:46,146
See what you see.
Nurse Bibbs.

975
01:39:46,938 --> 01:39:48,982
Nurse Bibbs and a rubber horse.

976
01:39:49,901 --> 01:39:52,737
Oh, oh, I see.

977
01:39:54,322 --> 01:39:56,408
Thank you Nurse Bibbs.

978
01:39:56,742 --> 01:39:58,035
Thank you.

979
01:41:08,284 --> 01:41:09,493
Hi.

980
01:41:14,041 --> 01:41:15,460
Are you out there?

981
01:41:17,755 --> 01:41:21,633
Well, I see your light's still on,
so you must be out there.

982
01:41:27,724 --> 01:41:29,434
It's OK if you don't want to talk,

983
01:41:29,517 --> 01:41:32,021
I don't want to talk either sometimes.

984
01:41:33,898 --> 01:41:35,858
I'd just like to stay silent.

985
01:41:42,699 --> 01:41:44,118
Do you mind if I sit down?

986
01:41:54,130 --> 01:41:56,759
Do you mind if I sit down?

987
01:41:58,928 --> 01:41:59,970
No.

988
01:42:03,140 --> 01:42:04,101
Thanks.

989
01:42:05,060 --> 01:42:08,356
Legs get a little tired from standing all the time.

990
01:42:12,486 --> 01:42:14,321
Is this your first visit here?

991
01:42:15,614 --> 01:42:16,532
Yes.

992
01:42:20,204 --> 01:42:23,332
Well, this whole thing must seem
kinda strange to you, huh?

993
01:42:24,084 --> 01:42:27,170
You realize that I can't see you even
though you can see me.

994
01:42:28,046 --> 01:42:30,132
Well, that takes a little getting used to.

995
01:42:35,388 --> 01:42:37,391
Am I looking at your face now?

996
01:42:47,444 --> 01:42:49,112
It don't matter.

997
01:43:04,006 --> 01:43:06,425
If there is anything you want to talk about.

998
01:43:06,550 --> 01:43:08,802
I'll just listen. Alright?

999
01:43:10,680 --> 01:43:13,349
I'm a real good listener.

1000
01:43:25,490 --> 01:43:27,325
Is there something...

1001
01:43:28,618 --> 01:43:30,871
Is there something I can do for you?

1002
01:43:40,632 --> 01:43:42,884
Do you mind if I take off my sweater?

1003
01:43:45,721 --> 01:43:47,515
I'll just take off my sweater.

1004
01:43:47,765 --> 01:43:49,475
No, no. Don't.

1005
01:43:50,518 --> 01:43:52,687
Please, please leave it on.

1006
01:44:01,156 --> 01:44:02,241
I'm sorry.

1007
01:44:06,538 --> 01:44:09,541
I just don't know exactly
what it is you want.

1008
01:44:11,585 --> 01:44:13,420
I don't want anything.

1009
01:44:15,798 --> 01:44:17,843
So why did you come here then?

1010
01:44:27,854 --> 01:44:29,689
I want to talk to you.

1011
01:44:50,964 --> 01:44:53,009
Is there something you want to tell me?

1012
01:44:56,929 --> 01:44:57,931
No...

1013
01:45:03,313 --> 01:45:06,150
You can tell me, I can keep a secret.

1014
01:45:17,370 --> 01:45:20,833
Is it all you do, just talk?

1015
01:45:24,797 --> 01:45:26,548
Well, yeah.

1016
01:45:28,842 --> 01:45:30,302
Yeah, mostly.

1017
01:45:30,969 --> 01:45:32,431
And listen.

1018
01:45:37,062 --> 01:45:38,606
What else do you do?

1019
01:45:49,827 --> 01:45:51,328
Why are you laughing?

1020
01:45:51,704 --> 01:45:52,914
I'm sorry.

1021
01:45:57,585 --> 01:45:58,629
I'm sorry.

1022
01:46:00,297 --> 01:46:02,466
So, what else do you do?

1023
01:46:04,844 --> 01:46:06,638
Nothing, really.

1024
01:46:09,517 --> 01:46:12,437
Oh, well, we are not allowed
to see the customers out of here.

1025
01:46:14,773 --> 01:46:18,903
What if you see them,
do you go home with them?

1026
01:46:20,572 --> 01:46:22,240
No sir, we don't.

1027
01:46:25,119 --> 01:46:28,497
We're not allowed to have any outside
relationships with the customers.

1028
01:46:28,789 --> 01:46:31,500
Yeah, but you can really see them
if you want too, can't you.

1029
01:46:31,500 --> 01:46:34,379
I mean you can go home with them,
if you want to, all these places say that.

1030
01:46:34,546 --> 01:46:38,383
I mean, how much extra money do you make?
How much money do you make on the side?

1031
01:46:51,232 --> 01:46:52,276
I'm sorry,

1032
01:46:52,359 --> 01:46:55,196
Sir, I think you maybe want to talk
to one of the other girls.

1033
01:46:55,321 --> 01:46:57,656
I'll see if I can find one for you.

1034
01:46:57,656 --> 01:46:59,659
No, no, no. No!

1035
01:47:00,327 --> 01:47:01,870
Please.

1036
01:47:04,122 --> 01:47:05,666
Please don't go.

1037
01:47:10,713 --> 01:47:13,675
I just don't think
I'm the one you want to talk to.

1038
01:47:16,054 --> 01:47:17,430
Please.

1039
01:47:18,849 --> 01:47:20,684
Please don't go, I'm sorry.

1040
01:47:30,403 --> 01:47:31,446
Alright.

1041
01:47:38,746 --> 01:47:39,790
I'm sorry.

1042
01:47:47,591 --> 01:47:48,676
That's OK.

1043
01:48:00,857 --> 01:48:04,151
I know how hard it is
to talk to strangers sometimes.

1044
01:48:09,700 --> 01:48:11,243
Just relax.

1045
01:48:13,163 --> 01:48:15,290
Relax and tell me
what's on your mind.

1046
01:48:17,876 --> 01:48:19,253
I'll listen.

1047
01:48:21,798 --> 01:48:22,757
To you...

1048
01:48:28,431 --> 01:48:30,474
I don't mind listening.

1049
01:48:38,901 --> 01:48:41,112
I do it all the time.

1050
01:49:02,805 --> 01:49:04,307
She was there, wasn't she?

1051
01:49:43,353 --> 01:49:44,729
What's that?

1052
01:49:50,987 --> 01:49:52,154
A vacant lot.

1053
01:49:53,031 --> 01:49:54,741
I bought that land
when we were all together,

1054
01:49:55,367 --> 01:49:56,618
With your mom.

1055
01:50:00,332 --> 01:50:03,210
Thought we might live there someday.

1056
01:50:05,546 --> 01:50:06,631
Where?

1057
01:50:07,549 --> 01:50:08,758
Paris.

1058
01:50:09,843 --> 01:50:10,844
Texas.

1059
01:50:11,177 --> 01:50:12,262
Where's that?

1060
01:50:13,931 --> 01:50:15,808
Across the red river.

1061
01:50:20,981 --> 01:50:22,274
Do you like it?

1062
01:50:24,193 --> 01:50:25,736
Mean we live on dirt?

1063
01:50:41,297 --> 01:50:44,217
Why do you drink that stuff?
It stinks.

1064
01:50:46,219 --> 01:50:47,679
Wait a minute, where are you going?

1065
01:50:48,096 --> 01:50:49,473
To the truck.

1066
01:51:09,789 --> 01:51:11,123
Have another one?

1067
01:52:20,998 --> 01:52:24,044
This is not a place to bring a fancy woman.

1068
01:52:26,755 --> 01:52:31,219
Would you say, if you had a fancy woman,
would you bring her in a place like this?

1069
01:52:31,844 --> 01:52:33,721
What's a fancy woman?

1070
01:52:54,080 --> 01:52:55,039
My mother.

1071
01:52:57,833 --> 01:52:59,418
Not your mother.

1072
01:53:00,711 --> 01:53:02,005
But my mother.

1073
01:53:02,673 --> 01:53:04,967
Was not a fancy woman.

1074
01:53:05,217 --> 01:53:06,760
She was...

1075
01:53:13,059 --> 01:53:17,315
She never wanted to be a fancy woman.
She never even pretended to be a fancy woman.

1076
01:53:18,316 --> 01:53:19,776
Then what was she?

1077
01:53:20,694 --> 01:53:22,738
She was just plain.

1078
01:53:25,199 --> 01:53:27,034
Just plain, good.

1079
01:53:28,287 --> 01:53:30,163
She was very good.

1080
01:53:30,789 --> 01:53:31,999
But my daddy...

1081
01:53:35,003 --> 01:53:37,005
See, my daddy had...

1082
01:53:37,964 --> 01:53:39,674
He had this idea...

1083
01:53:40,008 --> 01:53:43,888
He had this idea that was kind of...

1084
01:53:45,014 --> 01:53:46,724
Kind of a sickness...

1085
01:53:48,311 --> 01:53:49,270
What idea?

1086
01:53:50,104 --> 01:53:52,189
He had this idea about her.

1087
01:53:56,069 --> 01:53:57,613
He looked at her...

1088
01:53:59,114 --> 01:54:00,908
But he didn't see her.

1089
01:54:04,245 --> 01:54:05,163
He...

1090
01:54:05,788 --> 01:54:07,624
He saw this idea.

1091
01:54:11,253 --> 01:54:15,634
And he told people
that she was from Paris.

1092
01:54:17,677 --> 01:54:19,304
A big joke.

1093
01:54:19,638 --> 01:54:21,433
He started telling everybody all the time,

1094
01:54:21,808 --> 01:54:23,894
Finally it wasn't a joke anymore.

1095
01:54:27,147 --> 01:54:28,775
He started believing it.

1096
01:54:30,818 --> 01:54:31,945
And...

1097
01:54:32,487 --> 01:54:34,155
He actually believed...

1098
01:54:37,076 --> 01:54:38,285
She...

1099
01:54:39,203 --> 01:54:40,496
Oh, God.

1100
01:54:41,665 --> 01:54:43,792
She would get so embarrassed.

1101
01:54:46,294 --> 01:54:47,337
She'd...

1102
01:54:48,506 --> 01:54:49,966
She was so...

1103
01:54:52,803 --> 01:54:54,763
She was so shy...

1104
01:55:43,821 --> 01:55:45,406
Lominos, cha, cha.

1105
01:56:14,566 --> 01:56:15,777
Left, dad.

1106
01:56:31,671 --> 01:56:33,547
Hunter, it's me.

1107
01:56:36,677 --> 01:56:39,888
I was afraid I'd never be able to say
the right words to you,

1108
01:56:40,264 --> 01:56:41,807
In person.

1109
01:56:42,642 --> 01:56:46,396
So, I'm trying to do it like this.

1110
01:56:49,650 --> 01:56:52,569
When I first saw you, this time

1111
01:56:53,737 --> 01:56:55,030
at Walts...

1112
01:56:57,075 --> 01:56:59,911
I was hoping for all kinds of things.

1113
01:57:02,415 --> 01:57:05,627
I was hoping to show you
that I was your father.

1114
01:57:08,255 --> 01:57:10,133
You showed me I was.

1115
01:57:13,886 --> 01:57:16,140
But the biggest thing I hoped for...

1116
01:57:19,059 --> 01:57:20,686
Can't come true.

1117
01:57:23,356 --> 01:57:24,941
I know that now.

1118
01:57:27,819 --> 01:57:29,655
You belong together with your mother.

1119
01:57:32,283 --> 01:57:34,577
You belong together with your mother.

1120
01:57:36,789 --> 01:57:39,167
It was me that tore you apart.

1121
01:57:39,834 --> 01:57:42,963
And I owe it to you
to bring you back together.

1122
01:57:45,132 --> 01:57:47,009
But I can't stay with you.

1123
01:57:47,468 --> 01:57:49,638
I could never heal up what happened.

1124
01:57:50,847 --> 01:57:53,266
It's just the way it is.

1125
01:57:54,851 --> 01:57:57,647
I can't even hardly remember what happened...

1126
01:57:58,356 --> 01:57:59,774
It's like a gap.

1127
01:58:00,691 --> 01:58:03,362
It left me alone in a way that...

1128
01:58:03,737 --> 01:58:05,364
I haven't gotten over.

1129
01:58:06,198 --> 01:58:07,658
And right now...

1130
01:58:08,116 --> 01:58:09,201
I'm afraid.

1131
01:58:11,330 --> 01:58:14,124
I'm afraid of walking away again.

1132
01:58:14,416 --> 01:58:16,795
I'm afraid of what I might find.

1133
01:58:18,588 --> 01:58:20,632
But I'm even more afraid of...

1134
01:58:21,424 --> 01:58:23,552
Not facing this fear.

1135
01:58:24,595 --> 01:58:26,305
I love you Hunter.

1136
01:58:28,307 --> 01:58:30,644
I love you more than my life.

1137
01:58:42,116 --> 01:58:44,703
- Hey.
- Hey.

1138
01:58:50,626 --> 01:58:52,253
Can I tell you something?

1139
01:58:55,006 --> 01:58:57,384
Sure... Anything you like.

1140
01:58:59,177 --> 01:59:00,554
It's kind of long.

1141
01:59:02,306 --> 01:59:03,933
I have plenty of time.

1142
01:59:27,879 --> 01:59:29,505
I knew these people...

1143
01:59:30,299 --> 01:59:31,383
What people?

1144
01:59:33,427 --> 01:59:34,887
These two people...

1145
01:59:40,685 --> 01:59:42,395
They were in love with each other...

1146
01:59:45,733 --> 01:59:47,151
The girl was...

1147
01:59:47,736 --> 01:59:52,075
Very young, about 17, or 18...
I guess.

1148
01:59:53,493 --> 01:59:54,994
And the guy was...

1149
01:59:55,578 --> 01:59:56,956
Quite a bit older.

1150
01:59:58,582 --> 02:00:01,377
And he was kind of raggedy and wild.

1151
02:00:02,920 --> 02:00:04,798
And she was very beautiful, you know?

1152
02:00:07,592 --> 02:00:08,426
Yeah.

1153
02:00:09,219 --> 02:00:13,182
And together they turned everything
into a kind of an adventure.

1154
02:00:14,642 --> 02:00:16,102
And she liked that.

1155
02:00:17,646 --> 02:00:20,984
Just an ordinary trip
down to the grocery store was...

1156
02:00:21,567 --> 02:00:23,152
Full of adventure.

1157
02:00:25,155 --> 02:00:28,033
And they were always laughing
at stupid things...

1158
02:00:28,409 --> 02:00:30,245
He liked to make her laugh.

1159
02:00:31,830 --> 02:00:32,872
And...

1160
02:00:35,083 --> 02:00:37,461
They didn't much care for anything else.

1161
02:00:38,254 --> 02:00:41,674
Cus all they wanted to do
was be with each other.

1162
02:00:43,593 --> 02:00:45,429
They were always together.

1163
02:00:46,221 --> 02:00:48,432
Sounds like they were very happy.

1164
02:00:50,435 --> 02:00:53,314
Yes. They were, they were real happy.

1165
02:00:54,898 --> 02:00:55,941
And he...

1166
02:00:56,483 --> 02:00:58,194
Hey loved her more than...

1167
02:01:00,613 --> 02:01:02,490
He ever felt possible.

1168
02:01:05,828 --> 02:01:08,205
He couldn't stand being away from her,

1169
02:01:08,289 --> 02:01:10,542
During the day
when he went to work.

1170
02:01:15,756 --> 02:01:17,258
So he quit.

1171
02:01:18,926 --> 02:01:20,678
Just to be home with her.

1172
02:01:21,554 --> 02:01:24,099
And then he'd get another job
when the money ran out...

1173
02:01:25,852 --> 02:01:27,687
And then he'd quit again.

1174
02:01:28,355 --> 02:01:31,317
But pretty soon, she started to worry.

1175
02:01:35,738 --> 02:01:37,824
- Bout what?
- Money I guess.

1176
02:01:38,575 --> 02:01:39,951
Not having enough.

1177
02:01:40,285 --> 02:01:42,579
Not knowing when the next check
was coming in.

1178
02:01:45,041 --> 02:01:47,335
Yeap, I know that feeling.

1179
02:01:47,960 --> 02:01:50,463
So, he started to get kinda...

1180
02:01:50,839 --> 02:01:52,299
Torn inside.

1181
02:01:56,303 --> 02:01:57,514
How do you mean?

1182
02:01:58,975 --> 02:02:01,143
Well, he knew he had to work
to support her...

1183
02:02:02,144 --> 02:02:04,564
But he couldn't stand
being away from her either.

1184
02:02:06,900 --> 02:02:08,193
I see.

1185
02:02:08,735 --> 02:02:11,864
And the more he was away from her,
the crazier he got.

1186
02:02:13,324 --> 02:02:16,077
Except now, he got really crazy.

1187
02:02:19,832 --> 02:02:21,959
He started imagining all kinds of things.

1188
02:02:24,212 --> 02:02:25,171
Like what?

1189
02:02:27,716 --> 02:02:31,220
He started thinking
she was seeing other men on the sly.

1190
02:02:33,223 --> 02:02:35,601
He'd come home from work
and accuse her of...

1191
02:02:36,060 --> 02:02:38,397
Spending the day
with somebody else.

1192
02:02:38,772 --> 02:02:41,275
He'd yell at her
and break things in the trailer.

1193
02:02:44,404 --> 02:02:45,447
The trailer...

1194
02:02:50,994 --> 02:02:52,079
Yes.

1195
02:02:53,581 --> 02:02:55,416
They lived in a trailer home.

1196
02:03:10,934 --> 02:03:13,772
Excuse me sir, but were you
in this with me the other day?

1197
02:03:15,273 --> 02:03:16,649
I don't mean to pry...

1198
02:03:19,070 --> 02:03:19,945
No.

1199
02:03:21,739 --> 02:03:22,657
Oh...

1200
02:03:26,745 --> 02:03:29,039
I thought I recognized
your voice for a minute.

1201
02:03:30,457 --> 02:03:31,376
No.

1202
02:03:32,335 --> 02:03:33,836
Wasn't me.

1203
02:03:34,504 --> 02:03:35,588
Uh huh...

1204
02:03:38,802 --> 02:03:39,928
Please go on.

1205
02:03:43,181 --> 02:03:46,477
Anyway... He started
to drink real bad.

1206
02:03:47,561 --> 02:03:50,189
He would stay out late to test her.

1207
02:03:52,567 --> 02:03:54,403
What do you mean, test her?

1208
02:03:55,487 --> 02:03:57,322
To see if she would get jealous.

1209
02:03:59,200 --> 02:04:01,285
Ha... uh huh.

1210
02:04:03,746 --> 02:04:07,167
He wanted her to get jealous.
But she didn't.

1211
02:04:07,584 --> 02:04:09,086
She just worried about him,

1212
02:04:10,130 --> 02:04:11,924
But that got him even madder.

1213
02:04:13,718 --> 02:04:14,885
Why?

1214
02:04:16,345 --> 02:04:17,888
Because...

1215
02:04:19,141 --> 02:04:21,977
He thought that if she never got jealous of him
she didn't really care about him.

1216
02:04:23,812 --> 02:04:27,275
Jealousy was a sign of her love for him.

1217
02:04:28,234 --> 02:04:29,902
And then one night,

1218
02:04:30,945 --> 02:04:34,116
One night she told him
that she was pregnant.

1219
02:04:35,034 --> 02:04:37,619
She was about 3 or 4 months pregnant.

1220
02:04:37,995 --> 02:04:39,706
And he didn't even know.

1221
02:04:40,415 --> 02:04:42,626
And then suddenly everything would change.

1222
02:04:43,711 --> 02:04:46,798
He stopped drinking,
and got a steady job.

1223
02:04:47,674 --> 02:04:49,634
He was convinced
that she loved him now,

1224
02:04:49,718 --> 02:04:51,888
Because she was carrying his child.

1225
02:04:52,847 --> 02:04:56,601
And he was going to dedicate himself
to making a home for her.

1226
02:04:57,852 --> 02:04:59,938
But a funny thing started to happen.

1227
02:05:00,481 --> 02:05:01,690
What?

1228
02:05:02,274 --> 02:05:04,568
He didn't even notice it at first.

1229
02:05:04,943 --> 02:05:06,905
She started to change.

1230
02:05:07,697 --> 02:05:09,240
From the day the baby was born.

1231
02:05:09,366 --> 02:05:11,994
She began to get irritated
with everything around her.

1232
02:05:12,536 --> 02:05:14,246
She got mad at everything.

1233
02:05:15,499 --> 02:05:18,502
Even the baby seemed
to be injustice to her.

1234
02:05:19,087 --> 02:05:21,714
He kept trying to make everything
alright for her,

1235
02:05:22,006 --> 02:05:23,466
Buy her things,

1236
02:05:23,466 --> 02:05:25,803
Take her out to dinner once a week.

1237
02:05:26,512 --> 02:05:28,555
But nothing seemed to satisfy her.

1238
02:05:29,348 --> 02:05:32,811
For two years, he struggled
to pull them back together,

1239
02:05:32,894 --> 02:05:35,271
Like the were when they first met.

1240
02:05:36,523 --> 02:05:40,361
But finally he knew
that it was never going to work out.

1241
02:05:42,488 --> 02:05:44,281
So he hit the bottle again.

1242
02:05:44,657 --> 02:05:46,868
But this time it got mean.

1243
02:05:47,954 --> 02:05:50,123
This time when he came home
late at night,

1244
02:05:50,456 --> 02:05:53,168
She wasn't worried about him,
or jealous.

1245
02:05:53,919 --> 02:05:56,088
She was just enraged.

1246
02:05:57,631 --> 02:05:59,968
She accused him of holding her captive.

1247
02:06:00,302 --> 02:06:02,138
By making her have a baby.

1248
02:06:04,181 --> 02:06:06,476
She told him
that she dreamed about escaping.

1249
02:06:07,185 --> 02:06:09,938
That was all she dreamed about... Escape.

1250
02:06:11,148 --> 02:06:14,402
She saw herself at night,
running naked down a highway.

1251
02:06:15,069 --> 02:06:16,946
Running across fields.

1252
02:06:17,321 --> 02:06:18,991
Running down river beds.

1253
02:06:19,408 --> 02:06:20,660
Always running.

1254
02:06:21,119 --> 02:06:23,580
And always when she was
just about to get away...

1255
02:06:23,955 --> 02:06:25,248
He would be there.

1256
02:06:25,833 --> 02:06:27,501
He would stop her somehow.

1257
02:06:29,253 --> 02:06:31,172
He would just appear and stop her.

1258
02:06:34,634 --> 02:06:38,263
And when she told him these dreams,
He believed them.

1259
02:06:39,223 --> 02:06:40,641
He knew she had to be stopped,

1260
02:06:40,808 --> 02:06:42,435
Or she would leave him forever.

1261
02:06:43,352 --> 02:06:45,646
So he tied a cow bell to her ankle,

1262
02:06:45,981 --> 02:06:48,942
So he could hear at night
if she tried to get out of bed.

1263
02:06:50,069 --> 02:06:53,783
But she learned how to muffle the bell,
by stuffing a sock into it.

1264
02:06:54,116 --> 02:06:56,577
And inching her way
out of the bed...

1265
02:06:57,161 --> 02:06:58,662
And into the night.

1266
02:07:00,248 --> 02:07:02,125
He caught her one night
when the sock fell out

1267
02:07:02,292 --> 02:07:04,628
And he heard her
trying to run to the high way.

1268
02:07:04,795 --> 02:07:09,008
He caught her, dragged her
back to the trailer, and tied her to the stove,

1269
02:07:09,133 --> 02:07:10,676
With his belt.

1270
02:07:12,595 --> 02:07:13,931
He just left her there.

1271
02:07:14,515 --> 02:07:15,974
And went back to bed.

1272
02:07:17,434 --> 02:07:19,479
And lay there listing to her scream.

1273
02:07:21,189 --> 02:07:23,400
Then he'd listen to his son's scream.

1274
02:07:25,610 --> 02:07:30,117
And he was surprised at himself
because he didn't feel anything anymore.

1275
02:07:32,577 --> 02:07:35,289
All he wanted to do was sleep.

1276
02:07:37,583 --> 02:07:41,588
And for the first time,
he wished he were far away.

1277
02:07:45,551 --> 02:07:49,222
Lost in a deep vast country
where nobody knew him.

1278
02:07:50,473 --> 02:07:52,183
Somewhere without language.

1279
02:07:53,310 --> 02:07:54,645
Or streets.

1280
02:07:56,105 --> 02:07:58,900
And he dreamed about this place
without knowing it's name.

1281
02:08:00,194 --> 02:08:01,571
And when he woke up,

1282
02:08:02,071 --> 02:08:03,489
He was on fire.

1283
02:08:06,452 --> 02:08:09,455
There were blue flames
among the sheets of his bed.

1284
02:08:10,539 --> 02:08:12,374
He ran through the flames,

1285
02:08:13,376 --> 02:08:15,462
Toward the only two people he loved.

1286
02:08:17,005 --> 02:08:18,381
But they were gone.

1287
02:08:21,635 --> 02:08:22,970
His arms were burning.

1288
02:08:23,262 --> 02:08:25,181
And he threw himself outside...

1289
02:08:27,225 --> 02:08:29,061
And rolled on the wet ground.

1290
02:08:32,106 --> 02:08:33,442
Then he ran.

1291
02:08:35,360 --> 02:08:37,446
He never looked back at the fire.

1292
02:08:40,408 --> 02:08:41,743
He just ran.

1293
02:08:48,501 --> 02:08:50,544
He ran until the sun came up.

1294
02:08:52,421 --> 02:08:54,341
And he couldn't run any further.

1295
02:08:56,676 --> 02:08:58,428
And when the sun went down...

1296
02:08:59,221 --> 02:09:00,890
He ran again.

1297
02:09:07,148 --> 02:09:09,484
For five days he ran like this.

1298
02:09:11,653 --> 02:09:13,697
Until every sign of man...

1299
02:09:16,742 --> 02:09:18,244
Has disappeared.

1300
02:09:29,675 --> 02:09:31,009
Travis.

1301
02:10:14,228 --> 02:10:15,897
If you turn the light off in there,

1302
02:10:16,230 --> 02:10:17,732
Would you be able to see me?

1303
02:10:25,866 --> 02:10:26,950
I don't know.

1304
02:10:32,332 --> 02:10:33,750
I never tried.

1305
02:10:52,981 --> 02:10:54,192
Can you see me?

1306
02:10:56,861 --> 02:10:58,154
Yeah.

1307
02:10:59,614 --> 02:11:01,033
Do you recognize me?

1308
02:11:03,994 --> 02:11:05,538
Oh, Travis.

1309
02:11:13,130 --> 02:11:15,174
I brought Hunter with me.

1310
02:11:27,773 --> 02:11:29,108
Don't you want to see him?

1311
02:11:32,278 --> 02:11:33,320
Yeah.

1312
02:11:42,790 --> 02:11:47,086
I wanted to see him so bad
that I didn't even dare imagine him anymore.

1313
02:11:53,344 --> 02:11:55,848
Ann kept sending me pictures of him.

1314
02:11:59,143 --> 02:12:01,104
Until I asked her to stop.

1315
02:12:07,904 --> 02:12:09,322
I couldn't stand...

1316
02:12:10,573 --> 02:12:13,659
The pain of seeing him
grow up and missing it.

1317
02:12:22,922 --> 02:12:25,549
Why didn't you keep him with you, Jane?

1318
02:12:28,970 --> 02:12:30,514
I couldn't, Travis.

1319
02:12:35,186 --> 02:12:37,772
I didn't have what I knew he needed.

1320
02:12:44,822 --> 02:12:48,243
I didn't want to use him
to fill all my emptiness.

1321
02:12:53,959 --> 02:12:55,711
Well he needs you now, Jane.

1322
02:12:56,587 --> 02:12:58,047
And he wants to see you.

1323
02:12:58,464 --> 02:12:59,424
He does?

1324
02:13:02,845 --> 02:13:03,762
Yes.

1325
02:13:08,810 --> 02:13:11,020
He's waiting for you...

1326
02:13:11,563 --> 02:13:12,522
Where?

1327
02:13:15,901 --> 02:13:17,069
Downtown.

1328
02:13:18,529 --> 02:13:19,738
In a hotel.

1329
02:13:22,367 --> 02:13:23,535
The Meridian.

1330
02:13:26,204 --> 02:13:28,207
Room 1520.

1331
02:13:36,009 --> 02:13:37,760
You're not going, are you?

1332
02:13:53,612 --> 02:13:55,448
I can't see you Jane.

1333
02:13:57,992 --> 02:13:59,411
Don't go yet.

1334
02:14:04,375 --> 02:14:05,710
Don't go yet.

1335
02:14:24,690 --> 02:14:26,150
I...

1336
02:14:28,737 --> 02:14:32,200
I used to make up long speeches
to you after you left.

1337
02:14:37,414 --> 02:14:39,583
I used to talk to you all the time.

1338
02:14:40,209 --> 02:14:41,752
Even though I was alone.

1339
02:14:45,841 --> 02:14:48,426
I walked around for months
talking to you.

1340
02:14:53,432 --> 02:14:56,186
Now, I don't know what to say.

1341
02:15:00,524 --> 02:15:03,403
It was easier when I just imagined you.

1342
02:15:11,538 --> 02:15:14,082
I even imagined you
talking back to me.

1343
02:15:19,088 --> 02:15:21,466
We'd have long conversations.

1344
02:15:23,469 --> 02:15:25,012
The two of us.

1345
02:15:29,017 --> 02:15:31,603
It was almost like you were there.

1346
02:15:35,983 --> 02:15:37,486
I would hear you.

1347
02:15:37,986 --> 02:15:39,696
I would see you, smell you.

1348
02:15:42,073 --> 02:15:43,701
I could hear your voice.

1349
02:15:47,121 --> 02:15:49,416
Sometimes your voice would wake me up.

1350
02:15:53,045 --> 02:15:56,841
It would wake me up in the middle of the night
just like you were there in the room with me.

1351
02:16:05,518 --> 02:16:06,477
Then...

1352
02:16:10,191 --> 02:16:12,235
It slowly faded.

1353
02:16:14,363 --> 02:16:16,407
I couldn't picture you anymore.

1354
02:16:20,578 --> 02:16:23,916
I tried to talk out loud to you
like I used to,

1355
02:16:23,916 --> 02:16:25,709
But there was no one there.

1356
02:16:29,631 --> 02:16:31,550
I couldn't hear you.

1357
02:16:37,348 --> 02:16:38,474
Then...

1358
02:16:44,232 --> 02:16:45,608
I just gave up.

1359
02:16:52,658 --> 02:16:54,285
Everything stopped.

1360
02:16:56,496 --> 02:16:57,539
You.

1361
02:17:02,210 --> 02:17:03,754
Just disappeared.

1362
02:17:10,554 --> 02:17:12,514
Now I'm working here.

1363
02:17:18,314 --> 02:17:20,524
I hear your voice all the time.

1364
02:17:26,740 --> 02:17:28,325
Every man...

1365
02:17:29,367 --> 02:17:30,995
Has your voice.

1366
02:17:50,519 --> 02:17:52,062
I'll tell Hunter...

1367
02:17:53,104 --> 02:17:54,439
That you are coming.

1368
02:17:58,945 --> 02:18:00,655
- Travis.
- What?

1369
02:18:05,160 --> 02:18:06,495
I'll be there.

1370
02:18:12,001 --> 02:18:12,877
Good.

1371
02:18:18,801 --> 02:18:21,346
- Meridian hotel...
- Yeah.

1372
02:18:26,185 --> 02:18:27,395
Room...

1373
02:19:41,816 --> 02:19:43,109
Oh, you little...

1374
02:21:19,432 --> 02:21:20,642
Your hair.

1375
02:21:21,100 --> 02:21:22,352
It's wet...
