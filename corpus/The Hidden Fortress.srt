1
00:01:38,974 --> 00:01:40,309
Stay away from me!

2
00:01:41,143 --> 00:01:42,477
You stink of dead bodies.

3
00:01:43,187 --> 00:01:45,981
Give it up.
 We both smell of corpses.

4
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:48,025
And it's all your fault!

5
00:01:54,323 --> 00:01:57,951
Your smell makes me want to puke.

6
00:01:58,744 --> 00:02:02,164
Though shitworms can't smell shit.

7
00:02:02,998 --> 00:02:04,625
What?

8
00:02:06,752 --> 00:02:10,005
You're a shitworm.
 You make me sick.

9
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:14,885
And you thought we'd make
 a fortune at the war.

10
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,352
What's funny, you idiot!

11
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,105
It's all funny!

12
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:32,194
First, we arrived late to the war.

13
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:36,865
Then they mistook us for
 the defeated side

14
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:39,368
and forced us to bury the dead.

15
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:47,668
We finally escaped and now it's
 been 2 days we've only had water.

16
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:56,009
But the funniest thing is
 your foolish cry baby face.

17
00:03:56,195 --> 00:03:57,196
Let's go home.

18
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:01,992
Don't you have any pride?

19
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:07,623
We've even been stripped
 of the arms we sold our homes for.

20
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:11,084
We can't go home like this.

21
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,962
Then take it off this dead guy.

22
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:20,093
Even if I'm desperate,
 I'm not a thief.

23
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:23,805
Do what you want. I'm going!

24
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:27,601
Go. I'll come home after
 I make a buck.

25
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:29,937
Don't come crying to me then.

26
00:04:30,646 --> 00:04:34,441
Get caught again
 and be a gravedigger.

27
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:38,320
Fool! Go away!

28
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:45,035
It'll be a blessing to see you go,
 you shitworm.

29
00:05:10,686 --> 00:05:13,814
We can't cross the border
 from this road.

30
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:16,525
It's a Yamana check station.

31
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:20,195
Not even a mouse could pass
 through those barricades.

32
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:39,631
If they find us, we're dead.

33
00:05:59,193 --> 00:05:59,860
What now?

34
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:08,869
Unless a fog breaks out,
 we can't move.

35
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:29,515
What does it say up there?

36
00:06:30,641 --> 00:06:34,686
It's a notice about a reward
 for 10 pieces of gold.

37
00:06:35,938 --> 00:06:36,939
Read it to me.

38
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:44,238
"Wanted. Princess Yuki of Akizuki."

39
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:48,659
"A reward of ten ryo
 for her capture."

40
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:54,998
"Three ryo for information
 of her whereabouts."

41
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:59,545
"By order of the Lord of Yamana."

42
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:15,310
- Move!
 - Walk!

43
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:42,880
I'm not one of them.

44
00:07:58,854 --> 00:08:02,733
I'm thankful for the fog
 but I can't see anything.

45
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:09,907
Which way is Hayakawa?

46
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:12,326
Shut up and follow me!

47
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:32,387
Who is it?

48
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:04,711
Not grave digging again.

49
00:09:24,648 --> 00:09:25,983
Matashichi!

50
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:28,253
Listen!

51
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:33,717
There is 200 kan of pure gold
 hidden in this castle.

52
00:10:34,635 --> 00:10:39,348
Until you find it, you're no
 longer men but moles!

53
00:10:41,517 --> 00:10:44,978
So dig! Dig until you drop, moles!

54
00:13:06,912 --> 00:13:09,456
Matashichi, this is hell.

55
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:11,250
It's the end!

56
00:13:11,542 --> 00:13:13,836
If we're going to die,
 let's die together.

57
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:05,512
That way!

58
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:21,695
Thieves! Rice thieves!

59
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:29,786
What shall we do now?

60
00:14:33,874 --> 00:14:35,751
Find the Princess.

61
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:37,794
The Princess?

62
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:40,839
The sole survivor
 of the Akizuki clan.

63
00:14:41,924 --> 00:14:45,928
I think the reward on her head
 is ten ryo.

64
00:14:47,304 --> 00:14:48,347
Ten pieces of gold?

65
00:14:49,056 --> 00:14:51,558
Informers get three.

66
00:14:52,768 --> 00:14:53,894
Three pieces of gold?

67
00:15:00,067 --> 00:15:02,402
It's no good. That's only a dream.

68
00:15:03,445 --> 00:15:06,281
If we get greedy and get caught,
 we're done for.

69
00:15:09,618 --> 00:15:12,246
I guess we'd better go home.

70
00:15:13,288 --> 00:15:17,084
But how will we cross the border?

71
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:20,963
Bang and we're dead.

72
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:30,472
Let's eat.

73
00:15:31,473 --> 00:15:33,600
I can't think on an empty stomach.

74
00:15:37,354 --> 00:15:38,856
Not ready.

75
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,819
These don't burn at all.

76
00:16:12,514 --> 00:16:13,473
What's this?

77
00:16:28,363 --> 00:16:30,657
Why, it's gold!

78
00:16:35,245 --> 00:16:36,955
You're right! It's gold!

79
00:16:46,882 --> 00:16:49,718
But... a piece of gold...
 inside a stick?

80
00:16:52,387 --> 00:16:56,725
I've heard of a rich man hiding
 gold in the pillars of his home, but...

81
00:16:58,185 --> 00:17:00,187
What's this? An insignia!

82
00:17:02,231 --> 00:17:03,440
Looks like a crescent.

83
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,693
The crescent is the Akizuki crest!

84
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:11,490
That's the reserve gold they were
 digging for in the castle.

85
00:17:36,431 --> 00:17:39,768
You made the fire -
 where did you get the wood?

86
00:18:00,372 --> 00:18:02,791
Let's split up and look.

87
00:18:05,711 --> 00:18:08,714
I'll go this way.
 You go over there to the marsh.

88
00:19:06,271 --> 00:19:07,231
The same piece!

89
00:19:09,107 --> 00:19:10,025
What are you doing?

90
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:11,777
One's mine!

91
00:19:12,611 --> 00:19:13,654
I found both!

92
00:19:14,321 --> 00:19:15,405
I found the stick first.

93
00:19:15,906 --> 00:19:16,698
I threw it!

94
00:19:17,199 --> 00:19:18,450
I picked up the gold!

95
00:19:18,867 --> 00:19:21,453
Liar! I'm the one who
 noticed it was gold.

96
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:28,293
- Let's go back.
 - Back?

97
00:19:29,795 --> 00:19:31,713
There must be more.

98
00:19:33,632 --> 00:19:36,218
If someone else notices it,
 we're screwed.

99
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,769
He's following us.

100
00:19:46,979 --> 00:19:49,189
Watch out. Maybe he's a bandit.

101
00:19:49,731 --> 00:19:51,859
He's not a bandit. He has no sword.

102
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:55,821
You can't be sure.
 He may work for one.

103
00:20:14,089 --> 00:20:15,257
He stopped following us.

104
00:20:16,258 --> 00:20:17,467
Let's go back.

105
00:20:20,262 --> 00:20:22,931
No, better be careful.

106
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:29,021
It's late, anyway.
 It won't hurt to wait one night.

107
00:20:29,938 --> 00:20:33,066
It's a big job.
 Better safe than sorry.

108
00:20:52,586 --> 00:20:57,841
We haven't seen that guy since,
 so maybe we didn't need to worry.

109
00:21:00,135 --> 00:21:08,477
Probably a lumberjack
 or a charcoal maker.

110
00:21:09,937 --> 00:21:12,314
So, let's get this straight now.

111
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,443
What?

112
00:21:18,654 --> 00:21:22,449
Don't play dumb.
 How to split up the gold.

113
00:21:24,576 --> 00:21:27,788
Let's be fair and divide it equally.

114
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:32,417
You don't like it?

115
00:21:35,587 --> 00:21:39,925
- But I...
 - Then it's settled! All right?

116
00:21:45,681 --> 00:21:46,974
Let's sleep.

117
00:21:48,684 --> 00:21:52,771
Sleep tight, and let's dream
 of mountains of gold.

118
00:22:33,687 --> 00:22:34,396
Hey!

119
00:22:39,526 --> 00:22:40,194
Good eve...

120
00:22:50,412 --> 00:22:51,205
Hey!

121
00:22:57,586 --> 00:22:58,962
Cold, isn't it?

122
00:23:31,954 --> 00:23:35,666
What are you doing here
 in the mountain?

123
00:23:37,626 --> 00:23:38,836
How about you?

124
00:23:40,629 --> 00:23:47,511
- Us? We intend to cross the border.
 - The border?

125
00:23:48,595 --> 00:23:53,100
- We want to go to Hayakawa.
 - Hayakawa?

126
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:56,353
But beyond the mountains
 it's Yamana.

127
00:24:00,524 --> 00:24:05,028
Yes... but you see...

128
00:24:08,323 --> 00:24:13,954
to go to Hayakawa...

129
00:24:15,205 --> 00:24:16,582
This is Hayakawa.

130
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:22,588
And this is Akizuki

131
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:25,632
where we are now.

132
00:24:27,009 --> 00:24:33,765
This is... Yamana.

133
00:24:36,643 --> 00:24:43,150
We want to go from Akizuki
 to Hayakawa.

134
00:24:43,692 --> 00:24:48,822
But the border is guarded
 by Yamana soldiers.

135
00:24:50,324 --> 00:24:58,457
So, we'll cross first to Yamana.

136
00:24:58,707 --> 00:25:02,794
And then slip into Hayakawa.

137
00:25:03,462 --> 00:25:04,713
See...

138
00:25:05,464 --> 00:25:10,093
There's no way that survivors
 of the Akizuki clan

139
00:25:10,219 --> 00:25:13,180
would go to Yamana,
 the enemy territory.

140
00:25:14,389 --> 00:25:20,854
So the border between Akizuki
 and Yamana should be open.

141
00:25:22,272 --> 00:25:23,315
That's right.

142
00:25:25,025 --> 00:25:28,403
The Hayakawa-Yamana border
 must be

143
00:25:28,529 --> 00:25:34,910
easier to cross than
 the Akizuki-Hayakawa border.

144
00:25:37,579 --> 00:25:40,040
Anyway, we're just peasants.

145
00:25:40,707 --> 00:25:44,211
Even if anything happened,
 we'd still make it.

146
00:25:57,516 --> 00:25:59,977
All right. I've made up my mind.

147
00:26:01,603 --> 00:26:05,232
Going through Yamana
 is a good idea.

148
00:26:07,442 --> 00:26:11,405
The 200 gold pieces are useless
 here, but with three men

149
00:26:11,572 --> 00:26:13,949
and three horses,
 we can carry it out.

150
00:26:19,538 --> 00:26:23,083
200 gold pieces?
 What are you talking about?

151
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,044
Be honest.

152
00:27:05,167 --> 00:27:06,668
I've got an eye on that place.

153
00:27:43,705 --> 00:27:49,670
- Don't kick the stones.
 - You stop grabbing my leg.

154
00:29:23,055 --> 00:29:23,931
What now?

155
00:29:25,474 --> 00:29:27,100
What is he doing?

156
00:29:33,315 --> 00:29:34,107
He's not here.

157
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:38,028
Where did he go?

158
00:29:40,697 --> 00:29:42,533
That guy can't be trusted.

159
00:29:45,869 --> 00:29:48,038
What is this place?

160
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,554
It's what they call
 a hidden fortress.

161
00:30:04,346 --> 00:30:06,807
A hidden fortress?
 The Akizuki one.

162
00:30:08,642 --> 00:30:11,520
Look. You can see all of Yamana.

163
00:30:16,191 --> 00:30:17,192
But...

164
00:30:19,194 --> 00:30:21,655
For a fortress,
 it's strangely empty.

165
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:26,368
Someone's here!

166
00:30:33,667 --> 00:30:35,127
What are you doing?

167
00:30:40,632 --> 00:30:43,719
Oh, it's that guy.

168
00:30:45,429 --> 00:30:47,890
Hey. Come down quickly.

169
00:31:09,369 --> 00:31:11,371
How did you get down there?

170
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:12,915
What are your names?

171
00:31:13,749 --> 00:31:15,209
I'm Matashichi.

172
00:31:15,959 --> 00:31:16,919
I'm Tahei.

173
00:31:17,961 --> 00:31:19,505
Matashichi, put the rice down.

174
00:31:20,672 --> 00:31:22,674
Tahei, you put the rice in the pot.

175
00:31:25,802 --> 00:31:26,678
Hurry up!

176
00:31:30,432 --> 00:31:36,897
Where's the water? I need
 a drink before the food.

177
00:31:37,773 --> 00:31:40,150
Me too. I can't even spit anymore.

178
00:31:42,277 --> 00:31:45,280
Hey. What's your name?

179
00:31:48,534 --> 00:31:53,247
Me? I'm Rokurota Makabe.

180
00:31:54,122 --> 00:31:58,085
Rokurota Makabe?
 I've heard that name before.

181
00:32:00,629 --> 00:32:02,756
Makabe...

182
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:05,968
Rokurota Makabe...

183
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,391
Get out of here. Rokurota Makabe

184
00:32:12,516 --> 00:32:16,061
is a legendary Akizuki
 samurai general.

185
00:32:19,147 --> 00:32:21,441
You take us for fools.

186
00:32:48,218 --> 00:32:49,553
We shouldn't put up with this.

187
00:32:51,263 --> 00:32:57,102
Hey. Stop fooling around. You're no
 general, you're just a bully.

188
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:01,356
What's with the big attitude?

189
00:33:04,359 --> 00:33:09,198
Don't make fun of us. Damn you.

190
00:33:36,308 --> 00:33:37,226
What?

191
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:47,152
That wasn't very nice.

192
00:33:49,112 --> 00:33:52,658
You could have told us if
 there was a secret passageway.

193
00:33:53,742 --> 00:33:56,870
We've been partners
 since last night.

194
00:33:57,663 --> 00:34:00,791
Besides, just because you found
 this place first,

195
00:34:00,916 --> 00:34:02,793
doesn't mean you're the boss.

196
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:14,054
Let's decide now how
 we're going to divvy up.

197
00:34:15,013 --> 00:34:18,517
Fair and square, we share it
 in three equal parts. Deal?

198
00:34:19,226 --> 00:34:20,310
Here's the water.

199
00:34:53,468 --> 00:34:54,553
Excellent.

200
00:35:08,192 --> 00:35:13,906
This is some fortress that
 they have water like this.

201
00:35:32,049 --> 00:35:35,344
Don't bother.
 I already went through there.

202
00:35:36,178 --> 00:35:37,554
Just prepare the rice.

203
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:41,558
Shut up. I can't take it anymore.
 You can stuff your orders.

204
00:35:43,101 --> 00:35:44,228
You want to fight?

205
00:35:44,353 --> 00:35:46,230
Don't hold back. Do him in.

206
00:36:17,553 --> 00:36:18,387
Cook the rice.

207
00:36:29,064 --> 00:36:30,023
It's a girl.

208
00:36:50,669 --> 00:36:52,796
Where is she? Who is she?

209
00:36:53,922 --> 00:36:57,634
I don't know. She's really quick
 though. She's already gone.

210
00:37:01,889 --> 00:37:06,018
Look. She's mine, OK? I'll kill you
 if you go near her.

211
00:37:07,477 --> 00:37:09,438
Cook and then it's work.

212
00:37:13,567 --> 00:37:14,651
What are you doing?

213
00:38:16,672 --> 00:38:20,133
Don't touch me, fool!
 It's uncomfortable enough.

214
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,805
It's your face that
 makes me uncomfortable.

215
00:38:27,099 --> 00:38:30,310
Leave my face alone.

216
00:38:33,981 --> 00:38:38,819
I hate the way you blink
 all the time.

217
00:38:41,655 --> 00:38:43,240
There you go again.

218
00:38:47,244 --> 00:38:50,873
Shut up. Put your filthy teeth away.

219
00:38:52,833 --> 00:38:57,171
Show them to me once more
 and I'll bash them in.

220
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:17,191
I'm quitting! This is idiotic!
 I dig and dig and nothing!

221
00:39:18,775 --> 00:39:20,486
It's his fault.

222
00:39:28,911 --> 00:39:30,704
Dammit. Gone again.

223
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:42,216
He's on his high horse
 watching us do all the work.

224
00:39:43,008 --> 00:39:46,929
Right. He's probably running
 around looking for that girl.

225
00:39:48,263 --> 00:39:53,727
Maybe he already found a place
 and is sleeping with her.

226
00:39:54,394 --> 00:39:59,900
We agreed to split everything in
 three. The girl should be the same.

227
00:40:00,651 --> 00:40:03,111
That bully is not just anyone.

228
00:40:03,779 --> 00:40:05,906
I can't figure out what he's up to.

229
00:40:07,825 --> 00:40:12,162
He may already have found the 200
 pieces of gold and moved them.

230
00:40:15,165 --> 00:40:18,460
That's very likely. I'm sure of it.

231
00:40:22,798 --> 00:40:26,802
That means he's hiding the gold
 right now.

232
00:40:27,845 --> 00:40:30,430
So if he's not in this fortress...

233
00:40:32,474 --> 00:40:34,059
Look!

234
00:40:34,768 --> 00:40:36,395
That spring is fishy.

235
00:40:38,397 --> 00:40:42,317
Pretending like he's already
 checked it out... damn.

236
00:41:44,546 --> 00:41:46,048
Where do you live?

237
00:41:50,636 --> 00:41:52,137
Hey, lady, don't be mad.

238
00:43:25,814 --> 00:43:27,065
What are you doing?

239
00:43:27,191 --> 00:43:31,278
Shut up! I told you I'd kill you
 if you touched her!

240
00:43:35,741 --> 00:43:39,077
Wait, boss. It's not fair.

241
00:43:40,078 --> 00:43:42,581
Look. The girl dropped this.

242
00:43:44,833 --> 00:43:49,171
Don't go behind our back.
 She's worth 10 ryo.

243
00:43:50,339 --> 00:43:52,341
This does not belong
 to a country girl.

244
00:43:52,591 --> 00:43:56,929
Maybe you think she's the
 Akizuki princess.

245
00:44:00,265 --> 00:44:01,391
You're right.

246
00:44:02,643 --> 00:44:04,394
That comb does belong
 to Princess Yuki.

247
00:44:05,687 --> 00:44:09,107
But now it belongs to me.
 Give it back.

248
00:44:12,611 --> 00:44:14,738
I took it from the Princess
 and gave it to her.

249
00:44:15,113 --> 00:44:16,031
What?

250
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:17,157
I don't lie.

251
00:44:18,951 --> 00:44:20,244
Then where is Princess Yuki?

252
00:44:21,453 --> 00:44:23,038
I captured her and handed her
 over to the Yamana authorities.

253
00:44:24,915 --> 00:44:27,584
Careful. I think he's full of crap.

254
00:44:32,506 --> 00:44:36,468
Here's the reward of 10 ryo.
 Still think it's a lie?

255
00:44:53,610 --> 00:44:55,195
Tell me. Where did Matashichi go?

256
00:44:55,904 --> 00:44:56,905
I don't know.

257
00:44:59,408 --> 00:45:01,535
What are you plotting? Tell me!

258
00:45:02,411 --> 00:45:04,163
To... to the town.

259
00:45:04,496 --> 00:45:05,789
To do what?

260
00:45:07,249 --> 00:45:09,501
He went to report.

261
00:45:09,793 --> 00:45:11,211
Report who?

262
00:45:11,545 --> 00:45:15,090
- The princess, of course.
 - The princess?

263
00:45:22,681 --> 00:45:26,101
We're not as stupid as you think.

264
00:45:27,436 --> 00:45:31,398
You thought you had fooled us
 but we're not that gullible.

265
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:34,776
I know your game.

266
00:45:35,777 --> 00:45:43,869
Your reward money is just
 a part of the hidden gold.

267
00:45:45,787 --> 00:45:48,457
You're greedy on top of it.

268
00:45:48,874 --> 00:45:52,169
You want to capture
 the princess yourself

269
00:45:52,294 --> 00:45:54,630
so you can have all the reward.

270
00:45:55,255 --> 00:45:57,132
It won't go so smoothly.

271
00:45:59,009 --> 00:46:00,761
I made a mistake
 by relying on scum.

272
00:46:02,304 --> 00:46:04,348
You think you're better, scum?

273
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:14,358
Matashichi, did you see
 the officers?

274
00:46:14,650 --> 00:46:17,945
Fool. Do you think
 I'd be back so soon?

275
00:46:19,071 --> 00:46:23,116
It's the talk of town already.
 The princess was captured

276
00:46:23,242 --> 00:46:26,954
a while back and
 she was beheaded yesterday.

277
00:46:49,101 --> 00:46:52,646
Boss, we're sorry we doubted you.

278
00:48:22,653 --> 00:48:23,737
It's Rokurota Makabe.

279
00:48:24,363 --> 00:48:25,364
Enter.

280
00:48:39,169 --> 00:48:39,920
Any news?

281
00:48:42,422 --> 00:48:44,258
Kofuyu served her duty.

282
00:48:49,763 --> 00:48:52,057
The enemy will relax
 their guard now.

283
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:55,853
Now is our chance to escape.

284
00:48:57,354 --> 00:49:00,440
What happened to Kofuyu?

285
00:49:02,276 --> 00:49:06,113
As a dutiful servant, my sister went
 in place of your Highness.

286
00:49:07,948 --> 00:49:11,368
This assures the safety
 of your Highness.

287
00:49:12,244 --> 00:49:13,287
Rokurota!

288
00:49:14,538 --> 00:49:15,038
Fool!

289
00:49:15,164 --> 00:49:17,457
What are you saying your Highness?

290
00:49:18,709 --> 00:49:24,965
Kofuyu was 16... I am 16. What
 difference is there in our souls?

291
00:49:25,757 --> 00:49:32,014
It is our duty as servants.
 Kofuyu was honored...

292
00:49:32,598 --> 00:49:38,187
Lies! If I were Kofuyu,
 I would curse this Princess.

293
00:49:38,353 --> 00:49:43,692
Your words are too harsh.
 Rokurota has no leg to stand on.

294
00:49:44,276 --> 00:49:45,110
Be quiet!

295
00:49:47,029 --> 00:49:51,408
I don't even want to see your face!

296
00:49:52,826 --> 00:49:56,705
Your nobility that doesn't
 even shed a tear

297
00:49:56,872 --> 00:49:58,290
when you've killed your sister.

298
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:04,796
I hate it!

299
00:50:06,048 --> 00:50:06,965
I hate it!

300
00:50:16,850 --> 00:50:22,231
I don't know what to do with her
 Highness. It's the Lord's fault.

301
00:50:23,106 --> 00:50:25,734
Even if he was lacking an heir,

302
00:50:25,901 --> 00:50:29,988
it was cruel to raise her Highness
 like a boy.

303
00:50:30,739 --> 00:50:34,243
Say right and she'll go left,
 say left and she'll go right.

304
00:50:35,244 --> 00:50:42,084
And though she is a girl,
 she has never shown me a tear.

305
00:50:42,918 --> 00:50:44,711
The same
 with her present behavior.

306
00:50:46,088 --> 00:50:50,676
Insensitive to your pain of having
 sacrificed your sister, she...

307
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:55,389
She herself does not shed a tear,
 but she still criticizes you.

308
00:50:56,014 --> 00:50:57,850
It's too much.

309
00:50:59,893 --> 00:51:01,645
Her Highness is the real sacrifice.

310
00:51:03,230 --> 00:51:06,900
Her suffering of having to rebuild
 the Akizuki clan...

311
00:51:54,823 --> 00:51:57,701
The Yamana's are here!

312
00:51:58,994 --> 00:52:01,079
There are horses at the spring.

313
00:52:58,220 --> 00:53:03,517
This is good, to fool the Yamana's
 by going through enemy lines.

314
00:53:04,017 --> 00:53:08,522
This was the peasants' idea.

315
00:53:09,773 --> 00:53:13,735
Depending on their answers,
 I was ready to kill them.

316
00:53:13,902 --> 00:53:18,031
But hearing their plan to go
 through Yamana to Hayakawa,

317
00:53:18,157 --> 00:53:19,324
I was stunned.

318
00:53:19,449 --> 00:53:21,910
Sometimes even moss can be smart...

319
00:53:26,456 --> 00:53:29,543
How long can we rely on them?

320
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:32,254
We can rely on their greed.

321
00:53:33,005 --> 00:53:35,674
Make them carry gold and
 they'll put up with anything.

322
00:53:37,426 --> 00:53:39,511
That takes care of the gold.

323
00:53:41,513 --> 00:53:47,019
But we cannot take a chance
 with the Princess.

324
00:53:48,061 --> 00:53:51,440
But staying here is not safe either.

325
00:53:53,025 --> 00:53:55,944
This hidden fortress will soon
 be discovered by the Yamana's too.

326
00:53:56,862 --> 00:54:01,492
And our deal with Lord Hayakawa
 may not last either.

327
00:54:02,993 --> 00:54:04,036
Understood.

328
00:54:05,454 --> 00:54:09,458
But what shall we do
 with the Princess?

329
00:54:15,172 --> 00:54:17,966
We can disguise her looks,
 but not her class.

330
00:54:20,385 --> 00:54:22,846
And her speech...

331
00:54:24,306 --> 00:54:28,143
Her Highness
 will have to be a mute.

332
00:54:28,310 --> 00:54:32,940
A mute... isn't there any other way?

333
00:54:34,358 --> 00:54:35,359
There isn't.

334
00:54:36,318 --> 00:54:40,197
I don't know if the Princess
 would agree.

335
00:54:45,536 --> 00:54:46,995
Leave it to me.

336
00:54:51,166 --> 00:54:52,417
I hadn't ridden in a long time.

337
00:54:53,377 --> 00:54:57,089
She runs fast. She's too good
 to be a packhorse.

338
00:54:57,840 --> 00:55:00,717
Just in case you need to ride.

339
00:55:01,802 --> 00:55:05,013
So we finally pass
 through enemy lines.

340
00:55:07,349 --> 00:55:13,689
- Speaking of which, could you play mute?
 - Mute?

341
00:55:15,107 --> 00:55:18,318
I'm sure you couldn't do it.

342
00:55:21,738 --> 00:55:26,618
To go through Yamana, my greatest
 concern is your speech.

343
00:55:27,411 --> 00:55:31,123
We were discussing
 you could be a mute...

344
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:33,792
But I think it's impossible.

345
00:55:36,128 --> 00:55:40,799
I was captured once and
 had to pretend to be a mute.

346
00:55:41,717 --> 00:55:44,303
It was agony.

347
00:55:45,095 --> 00:55:47,681
Your Highness couldn't take it.

348
00:55:58,025 --> 00:55:59,193
I'm not biting.

349
00:56:01,570 --> 00:56:04,239
When you say right, I say left.

350
00:56:06,742 --> 00:56:10,454
I'm a handful.

351
00:56:11,413 --> 00:56:16,460
Let me use reverse psychology.

352
00:56:16,877 --> 00:56:17,669
Princess.

353
00:56:18,253 --> 00:56:19,129
All right.

354
00:56:25,928 --> 00:56:31,391
This once I will let you fool me.
 Otherwise your plan will be foiled.

355
00:56:36,104 --> 00:56:39,024
Your noble face again.

356
00:56:40,108 --> 00:56:43,070
If you need anything, tell me now.

357
00:56:44,530 --> 00:56:47,533
Once I'm a mute,
 I'm not talking until Hayakawa.

358
00:57:06,969 --> 00:57:07,970
We have to tell him.

359
00:57:08,136 --> 00:57:10,264
The bully? Never mind him.

360
00:57:17,187 --> 00:57:19,815
Idiot, shut up. We'll get caught.

361
00:57:43,297 --> 00:57:44,214
Where are you going?

362
00:57:45,132 --> 00:57:49,511
Boss, run! The Yamana soldiers
 have found us.

363
00:57:50,012 --> 00:57:53,807
There were horses by the spring.

364
00:57:58,604 --> 00:58:01,690
Idiots. I stole those.

365
00:58:04,401 --> 00:58:07,070
We can't carry 200 pieces
 of gold without them.

366
00:58:07,613 --> 00:58:08,322
Gold?

367
00:58:10,699 --> 00:58:11,992
We'll climb down today.

368
00:58:13,368 --> 00:58:15,370
Where is the gold?

369
00:58:29,301 --> 00:58:32,513
Hey. Where is the gold?

370
00:58:33,555 --> 00:58:36,433
Don't hold out on us. Come on.

371
00:58:45,526 --> 00:58:46,401
I knew it!

372
00:58:49,822 --> 00:58:51,782
Don't fool around with us.

373
00:58:52,241 --> 00:58:54,827
You said you had already gone
 through there.

374
00:58:55,244 --> 00:58:57,704
Why did you make us dig
 at the fortress?

375
00:58:58,789 --> 00:59:00,040
I was testing you.

376
00:59:01,583 --> 00:59:05,420
We'll need a lot of backbone
 on the road. You did well.

377
00:59:06,255 --> 00:59:09,466
Lift the gold out of the water
 and onto the horses.

378
00:59:10,092 --> 00:59:11,885
The three of us will carry the rest.

379
00:59:24,148 --> 00:59:25,399
Gold!

380
00:59:26,441 --> 00:59:29,278
Leave the gold in the wood.

381
01:00:14,656 --> 01:00:15,616
Dammit.

382
01:00:22,456 --> 01:00:23,624
Where did you hide this?

383
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,628
You're so suspicious.
 That's just firewood.

384
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:36,887
It's a bad idea to take the girl.
 She'll slow us down.

385
01:00:40,140 --> 01:00:42,184
What if she blabs...

386
01:00:43,393 --> 01:00:46,063
- She's mute. Don't worry.
 - Mute?

387
01:02:11,607 --> 01:02:14,151
This will be an easy border
 to cross.

388
01:02:15,277 --> 01:02:16,069
Wait.

389
01:02:19,490 --> 01:02:20,532
Better be cautious.

390
01:02:27,998 --> 01:02:29,958
Don't move 'til I come back.

391
01:02:38,717 --> 01:02:42,012
If we want to get rid of him,
 now's our chance.

392
01:02:48,811 --> 01:02:50,187
Don't worry. She's mute.

393
01:02:50,771 --> 01:02:52,189
She's mute but she can hear.

394
01:02:52,689 --> 01:02:57,528
Stupid. A mute can't speak
 because she's deaf.

395
01:03:02,157 --> 01:03:03,450
This is where we have to think.

396
01:03:04,326 --> 01:03:08,831
He's sly so we can't trust him even
 if we cross into Hayakawa.

397
01:03:09,873 --> 01:03:11,083
He'll cheat us.

398
01:03:12,918 --> 01:03:14,336
Let's run away.

399
01:03:15,170 --> 01:03:17,089
What about his load?

400
01:03:19,132 --> 01:03:23,971
We can't carry it.
 We'll take his horse.

401
01:03:29,977 --> 01:03:32,396
There's no time to argue.

402
01:03:33,647 --> 01:03:36,275
Let's tell her we're taking
 the horses for a drink.

403
01:03:46,535 --> 01:03:48,162
Fool. They're not drinking sake.

404
01:05:48,907 --> 01:05:50,617
What are you doing?

405
01:06:28,447 --> 01:06:29,573
Where are the horses?

406
01:06:40,542 --> 01:06:41,668
What shall we do?

407
01:07:17,746 --> 01:07:18,288
Princess!

408
01:07:20,332 --> 01:07:23,877
It's frustrating to be a mute.
 All I can do is watch.

409
01:07:24,419 --> 01:07:24,878
The two of them?

410
01:07:25,671 --> 01:07:29,758
Out of greed, they took the horses.

411
01:07:30,717 --> 01:07:33,971
Then the enemy spotted them.
 Fine allies.

412
01:07:52,322 --> 01:07:53,365
You!

413
01:07:59,329 --> 01:08:02,291
We can't cross that river.

414
01:08:03,292 --> 01:08:05,335
There is a firing squad
 on the other side.

415
01:08:11,216 --> 01:08:14,887
I know your game.
 Take the gold and get lost.

416
01:09:02,100 --> 01:09:03,644
He's gone.

417
01:09:09,191 --> 01:09:12,194
Boss!

418
01:09:15,030 --> 01:09:17,491
There he is.

419
01:09:19,451 --> 01:09:22,955
Boss, the other side is lined
 with Yamana soldiers.

420
01:09:23,372 --> 01:09:25,165
What would you do?

421
01:09:26,667 --> 01:09:27,584
What do I care?

422
01:09:29,378 --> 01:09:31,547
What are you doing?

423
01:09:32,256 --> 01:09:33,924
Wait and see at the fortress?

424
01:09:34,716 --> 01:09:36,426
Shut up. Go away.

425
01:09:37,803 --> 01:09:39,721
Please, take us with you.

426
01:09:40,222 --> 01:09:43,183
We promise to behave.

427
01:09:55,696 --> 01:09:56,530
What's that?

428
01:10:10,586 --> 01:10:12,671
The Yamana's found it!

429
01:10:16,425 --> 01:10:18,510
What will we do?

430
01:10:41,366 --> 01:10:42,242
We're leaving.

431
01:10:43,410 --> 01:10:44,161
Which way?

432
01:10:45,037 --> 01:10:45,954
Straight ahead.

433
01:10:46,497 --> 01:10:47,372
You're joking!

434
01:10:50,918 --> 01:10:52,586
Leave it to me. I have a plan.

435
01:11:27,830 --> 01:11:28,956
Your pass?

436
01:11:30,958 --> 01:11:31,875
Wait!

437
01:11:36,463 --> 01:11:37,297
Boss.

438
01:11:42,678 --> 01:11:43,387
Next!

439
01:11:48,016 --> 01:11:49,852
Your pass. What's your problem?

440
01:11:51,603 --> 01:11:52,646
I picked up something.

441
01:11:53,063 --> 01:11:55,315
What? It's just a piece of wood.

442
01:11:56,316 --> 01:11:58,652
I found it at Mt. Suribachi.

443
01:12:07,536 --> 01:12:09,163
He found this.

444
01:12:16,378 --> 01:12:17,629
The Akizuki crest!

445
01:12:19,339 --> 01:12:21,175
You really found it
 at Mt. Suribachi?

446
01:12:23,010 --> 01:12:25,679
Bring me my horse!

447
01:12:26,472 --> 01:12:28,182
That gold is mine. Give it back.

448
01:12:28,682 --> 01:12:29,558
No.

449
01:12:30,684 --> 01:12:32,853
Give me the gold or a reward.

450
01:12:34,730 --> 01:12:36,023
Shut up. Get lost.

451
01:12:37,816 --> 01:12:39,610
Give me a reward. I won't move!

452
01:12:51,955 --> 01:12:55,292
A reward! Give me a reward!

453
01:13:27,074 --> 01:13:28,116
Greedy.

454
01:13:50,806 --> 01:13:54,810
Two or three loaded horses,
 several men and a girl.

455
01:13:55,310 --> 01:13:57,479
If you see such a group,
 arrest them immediately.

456
01:13:57,896 --> 01:14:01,692
There are signs that Princess
 Yuki's party has been here.

457
01:14:02,484 --> 01:14:05,737
But she was beheaded...

458
01:14:06,196 --> 01:14:08,782
Using a double has been
 done before.

459
01:14:09,658 --> 01:14:12,411
You also saw the smoke rise
 on the mountain across.

460
01:14:12,828 --> 01:14:14,246
That was Akizuki's hidden fortress.

461
01:14:14,997 --> 01:14:20,419
It was guarded by an old soldier
 and two others.

462
01:14:20,669 --> 01:14:22,129
They could have escaped. Instead
 they burned the fortress

463
01:14:22,337 --> 01:14:24,673
and fought 'til their end.

464
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:29,845
It appears they wanted to signal
 and gain time for others to escape.

465
01:14:31,346 --> 01:14:35,976
The Princess and a few men
 escaped with the gold for sure.

466
01:14:36,393 --> 01:14:38,937
There are traces on the road.

467
01:14:39,688 --> 01:14:44,151
Don't slack. Catch them
 and you will be rewarded.

468
01:15:26,401 --> 01:15:27,528
Are you ok, boss?

469
01:15:28,737 --> 01:15:30,948
Let's take a back road.

470
01:15:31,490 --> 01:15:35,202
- Stop sneaking around. It invites suspicion.
 - But...

471
01:16:28,964 --> 01:16:29,798
What are you doing?

472
01:16:30,716 --> 01:16:31,967
We're staying here tonight.

473
01:16:33,635 --> 01:16:34,511
Here?

474
01:16:37,181 --> 01:16:40,184
You've got to be kidding me.
 Let's hurry through the night.

475
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:46,482
It's a long way. Let's not push it.

476
01:16:46,815 --> 01:16:48,901
Then let's camp out.

477
01:16:50,027 --> 01:16:54,031
Hide a stone among stones
 and a man among men.

478
01:17:08,086 --> 01:17:10,714
Where will we hide the gold?

479
01:17:12,090 --> 01:17:13,300
Leave it out in the open.

480
01:17:50,170 --> 01:17:54,967
You're so slow. Get a clue
 and bring some water.

481
01:18:05,978 --> 01:18:10,190
Always crying,
 but you refuse to take johns.

482
01:18:10,816 --> 01:18:13,360
You were a lousy deal.

483
01:18:13,569 --> 01:18:15,070
Where did you get her?

484
01:18:15,612 --> 01:18:19,867
In Akizuki. Lose a war
 and plenty of women go on sale.

485
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:21,076
How much?

486
01:18:21,410 --> 01:18:23,537
Five silver pieces. Want her?

487
01:18:23,745 --> 01:18:26,707
Idiot. I'm not a dog like you.

488
01:18:27,875 --> 01:18:29,501
- You bluff.
 - No, sorry.

489
01:18:31,461 --> 01:18:32,588
Now, look here.

490
01:18:39,553 --> 01:18:40,262
Look.

491
01:18:40,721 --> 01:18:47,644
Average looking, but excellent
 body. How about it?

492
01:18:48,770 --> 01:18:51,565
For one silver piece,
 she's yours for the night.

493
01:18:52,149 --> 01:18:56,862
What's the use of buying a woman
 who won't take customers?

494
01:19:04,161 --> 01:19:04,995
How much is she?

495
01:19:07,122 --> 01:19:10,292
She's a looker!

496
01:19:10,709 --> 01:19:12,586
She's not one of yours?

497
01:19:19,802 --> 01:19:22,346
I'll buy her.
 Who does she belong to?

498
01:19:24,556 --> 01:19:25,933
Whose girl is she?

499
01:19:26,517 --> 01:19:31,021
I'll buy her! I'll buy her
 for a piece of gold!

500
01:19:33,816 --> 01:19:34,900
Enough!

501
01:19:36,318 --> 01:19:38,695
- She's a mute.
 - Mute?

502
01:19:48,455 --> 01:19:51,124
That's too bad. I'll pass.

503
01:20:12,855 --> 01:20:14,481
Who's the owner
 of the horse outside?

504
01:20:21,864 --> 01:20:22,781
Is it yours?

505
01:20:24,032 --> 01:20:25,784
Do you want to sell her to me?

506
01:20:26,660 --> 01:20:29,246
I'll give you whatever you want.

507
01:20:29,580 --> 01:20:30,831
But my load...

508
01:20:31,206 --> 01:20:39,173
She's too good for a packhorse. 5
 silver pieces. You can buy 5 horses.

509
01:20:49,349 --> 01:20:51,518
Boss. What shall we do?

510
01:20:55,772 --> 01:20:57,483
Two horses are not enough
 for everything.

511
01:21:00,402 --> 01:21:03,530
It's hard to find another one.

512
01:21:19,922 --> 01:21:21,048
This sucks.

513
01:21:21,298 --> 01:21:22,549
There is no time for girls.

514
01:21:28,889 --> 01:21:31,850
Buy that girl back.

515
01:21:32,684 --> 01:21:33,393
I cannot.

516
01:21:34,603 --> 01:21:37,397
Why not? I am
 the Princess of Akizuki.

517
01:21:38,273 --> 01:21:40,400
I can't bear to see one
 of our own in trouble.

518
01:21:41,068 --> 01:21:43,529
No, you're in trouble...

519
01:21:44,613 --> 01:21:46,990
Your kindness will harm you.

520
01:21:49,034 --> 01:21:54,331
Whatever. Buy her back.

521
01:21:54,998 --> 01:22:00,295
- No.
 - You cannot make my heart mute too!

522
01:22:06,969 --> 01:22:08,554
A cart was a bad idea.

523
01:22:09,263 --> 01:22:11,306
We're the horses now.

524
01:22:12,266 --> 01:22:14,768
And we've even taken in that girl.

525
01:22:31,076 --> 01:22:33,579
Stop following us. Go away.

526
01:22:35,330 --> 01:22:36,999
Go back to Akizuki.

527
01:22:48,343 --> 01:22:49,803
Don't stop. Continue.

528
01:23:03,358 --> 01:23:08,280
Have you seen four people,
 three horses and a girl?

529
01:23:08,864 --> 01:23:11,408
If you do, report them immediately.

530
01:23:21,210 --> 01:23:25,297
It went well. We're lucky.

531
01:23:33,889 --> 01:23:37,518
Who said a cart was a bad idea?

532
01:23:38,310 --> 01:23:41,522
You were grumbling about the girl.

533
01:23:44,233 --> 01:23:49,279
But those men are stupid.
 Why not check the wood?

534
01:23:58,747 --> 01:24:00,457
What shall we do now?

535
01:24:06,922 --> 01:24:07,714
Be calm!

536
01:24:23,939 --> 01:24:24,773
Put it down.

537
01:24:33,615 --> 01:24:34,575
Report them!

538
01:24:40,038 --> 01:24:41,623
Run! Wait on the hill!

539
01:25:56,156 --> 01:25:59,326
Why, if it isn't Rokurota Makabe!

540
01:26:03,914 --> 01:26:05,332
Hey, Hyoe Tadokoro!

541
01:26:08,502 --> 01:26:11,672
Stand aside!
 You're no match for him!

542
01:26:14,883 --> 01:26:15,843
A rare meeting.

543
01:26:17,219 --> 01:26:21,306
I regret not meeting you on the
 battlefields this time around.

544
01:26:22,641 --> 01:26:24,101
I regret it, too.

545
01:26:31,900 --> 01:26:32,860
How about a duel?

546
01:26:33,485 --> 01:26:34,361
With pleasure!

547
01:26:38,115 --> 01:26:40,784
With what? A spear?

548
01:26:43,036 --> 01:26:44,037
Sounds good.

549
01:26:44,997 --> 01:26:46,957
All of them are inferior,
 but choose one.

550
01:33:50,047 --> 01:33:50,881
I lost!

551
01:33:59,807 --> 01:34:00,974
Wait!

552
01:34:14,404 --> 01:34:15,656
We'll meet again.

553
01:34:20,327 --> 01:34:21,286
Rokurota!

554
01:35:04,621 --> 01:35:07,499
- Firewood?
 - What about firewood?

555
01:35:07,624 --> 01:35:09,877
Apparently gold is hidden
 in the wood.

556
01:35:10,544 --> 01:35:12,963
They're hiding here with all that.

557
01:35:13,672 --> 01:35:16,592
Four of them.
 One girl with three men.

558
01:35:17,301 --> 01:35:19,470
She's Princess Yuki from Akizuki.

559
01:35:20,762 --> 01:35:23,640
The reward is 200 pieces
 of gold for her.

560
01:35:24,016 --> 01:35:26,185
Five pieces just for information.

561
01:35:28,395 --> 01:35:31,523
Don't jump the gun.
 It won't be easy.

562
01:35:32,107 --> 01:35:36,195
A strong general, Rokurota Makabe,
 is with her.

563
01:36:03,514 --> 01:36:04,556
It's cold!

564
01:36:07,100 --> 01:36:08,811
It's been three days now.

565
01:36:10,687 --> 01:36:14,233
- More rain. More rain.
 - What?

566
01:36:16,944 --> 01:36:19,238
We can't move even if it stops.

567
01:36:20,614 --> 01:36:24,243
We go out there
 and we'll get beheaded.

568
01:36:25,160 --> 01:36:28,247
You madman.
 Are you glad to be beheaded?

569
01:36:29,915 --> 01:36:30,874
Why not?

570
01:36:32,251 --> 01:36:34,795
It's better than putting up
 with this.

571
01:36:35,629 --> 01:36:39,258
Then give up the gold and get lost.

572
01:36:42,344 --> 01:36:43,428
Good idea.

573
01:36:44,346 --> 01:36:45,389
I'll leave.

574
01:36:46,056 --> 01:36:47,891
But I'm taking all I can carry.

575
01:36:48,767 --> 01:36:50,435
I'll be set for life.

576
01:37:02,948 --> 01:37:04,324
I'll leave too.

577
01:37:09,037 --> 01:37:12,457
Great. What's left is all mine.

578
01:37:13,792 --> 01:37:15,502
Take what you want and beat it.

579
01:37:23,594 --> 01:37:27,347
But we're not getting anywhere.

580
01:37:38,525 --> 01:37:39,359
Where are you going?

581
01:37:40,652 --> 01:37:43,822
I'm going to find something
 to put the gold in.

582
01:39:01,775 --> 01:39:04,903
The one with the shorter one
 disappears for a while.

583
01:40:09,301 --> 01:40:10,385
He's late.

584
01:40:11,512 --> 01:40:15,974
I'm sure he'll be back soon.

585
01:41:05,899 --> 01:41:08,360
What's going on?
 Everyone is carrying wood...

586
01:41:09,570 --> 01:41:11,196
I know! It's the Fire Festival.

587
01:41:11,864 --> 01:41:16,952
Haven't you heard of the Yamana
 Fire Festival where the villagers

588
01:41:17,077 --> 01:41:18,537
dance around a bonfire?

589
01:41:19,079 --> 01:41:20,414
We lucked out!

590
01:41:24,877 --> 01:41:28,755
They're going in our direction.
 If we join the crowd...

591
01:41:37,389 --> 01:41:41,518
I don't get it. Why do we have
 to patrol a Fire Festival?

592
01:41:42,478 --> 01:41:45,063
Look. There's a lot
 of wood at the Festival.

593
01:41:45,481 --> 01:41:50,444
The Akizuki clan may hide here
 with their gold hidden in firewood.

594
01:41:53,155 --> 01:41:53,906
What's this?

595
01:42:57,386 --> 01:42:59,179
There is too much wood to check.

596
01:42:59,638 --> 01:43:03,809
We'll inspect the suspicious ones
 who stray from the crowd.

597
01:43:33,964 --> 01:43:34,548
Where is everyone?

598
01:43:34,715 --> 01:43:36,216
To the Festival...

599
01:43:36,383 --> 01:43:37,426
Marching with the crowd...

600
01:43:46,894 --> 01:43:55,277
The life of a man

601
01:43:56,195 --> 01:44:02,326
Burn it with the fire

602
01:44:03,577 --> 01:44:12,127
The life of an insect

603
01:44:12,878 --> 01:44:19,551
Throw it into the fire

604
01:44:22,054 --> 01:44:30,729
Ponder and you'll see

605
01:44:31,647 --> 01:44:37,611
The world is dark

606
01:44:39,238 --> 01:44:49,623
And this floating world is a dream

607
01:44:50,457 --> 01:44:58,423
Burn with abandon

608
01:45:20,445 --> 01:45:24,867
Burn it! Throw the cart
 into the fire!

609
01:45:25,617 --> 01:45:26,493
No!

610
01:45:29,413 --> 01:45:34,460
- Don't be stingy, fool.
 - No!

611
01:45:36,670 --> 01:45:37,671
They're suspicious.

612
01:45:39,173 --> 01:45:41,383
Move. Burn it!

613
01:45:59,026 --> 01:46:00,068
Dance!

614
01:47:27,614 --> 01:47:29,408
That's enough. Let's pack it up.

615
01:47:29,867 --> 01:47:31,285
But, Boss, there's more...

616
01:47:32,077 --> 01:47:33,162
Don't be greedy!

617
01:47:34,788 --> 01:47:36,623
There's no point in taking more
 than we can carry.

618
01:47:37,833 --> 01:47:41,587
You two carry 30 kan each.

619
01:47:42,921 --> 01:47:45,340
I carry 40... with the two women,
 that's 20...

620
01:47:45,841 --> 01:47:47,801
What? I can carry 40 kan too.

621
01:47:48,385 --> 01:47:49,470
I'll carry 50 kan.

622
01:48:31,678 --> 01:48:32,596
Hurry up!

623
01:49:20,310 --> 01:49:23,480
It's such a shame to leave
 that gold.

624
01:49:28,068 --> 01:49:28,986
Go back?

625
01:49:37,244 --> 01:49:39,163
Where are you going?

626
01:50:11,111 --> 01:50:12,571
No more.

627
01:50:13,739 --> 01:50:14,615
What are you looking for?

628
01:51:23,058 --> 01:51:25,352
Boss, help us!

629
01:51:26,937 --> 01:51:29,356
Help!

630
01:51:59,553 --> 01:52:00,929
If you want to live,
 pick up your load.

631
01:52:30,125 --> 01:52:32,002
Follow me!

632
01:54:02,509 --> 01:54:06,680
Hurry up! We can cross
 the mountain overnight.

633
01:54:52,559 --> 01:54:55,437
It's hard. I'd rather be dead.

634
01:54:58,398 --> 01:54:59,608
Then die.

635
01:55:21,713 --> 01:55:22,714
Boss!

636
01:55:23,590 --> 01:55:24,424
Calm down!

637
01:55:46,280 --> 01:55:47,114
Don't stand up!

638
01:55:50,159 --> 01:55:53,829
Listen! I'll run and distract them.
 Escape while you can.

639
01:56:24,818 --> 01:56:26,236
We're done for. Let's run.

640
01:56:28,572 --> 01:56:29,364
Farewell!

641
01:56:31,158 --> 01:56:32,117
Did you say something?

642
01:56:50,552 --> 01:56:55,974
I'm not worth it. Leave me and go.

643
01:57:23,085 --> 01:57:26,046
It's the end.

644
01:57:29,216 --> 01:57:31,927
If we get caught, they'll kill us.

645
01:57:35,347 --> 01:57:37,766
Not if we don't have any gold.

646
01:57:38,559 --> 01:57:39,893
We'll turn them in.

647
01:57:41,019 --> 01:57:44,898
You're right.
 Maybe we'll even get a reward.

648
01:57:45,065 --> 01:57:49,486
Idiot! They'll shoot us
 if we're not careful.

649
01:57:52,906 --> 01:57:58,036
I'm sure Yamana and Hayakawa
 are patrolling their border.

650
01:57:59,246 --> 01:58:00,664
We can report them there.

651
01:58:57,805 --> 01:58:59,598
Your Highness... Hayakawa.

652
01:59:16,782 --> 01:59:20,410
Are you joking? We got them
 and their gold long ago.

653
01:59:20,828 --> 01:59:22,329
Go home, fools.

654
01:59:58,198 --> 02:00:04,079
Look carefully! You won't see
 200 gold pieces again!

655
02:00:08,417 --> 02:00:11,170
I'd rather see Princess Yuki!

656
02:00:11,920 --> 02:00:13,172
She's a sight for sore eyes.

657
02:00:14,631 --> 02:00:17,801
To think she'll be beheaded
 tomorrow...

658
02:00:20,888 --> 02:00:21,680
Stay away!

659
02:00:21,847 --> 02:00:23,015
Just a glance.

660
02:00:27,060 --> 02:00:28,896
Let me through!

661
02:00:31,732 --> 02:00:34,985
Tadokoro here to identify them.

662
02:00:54,922 --> 02:00:57,299
Hyoe Tadokoro!

663
02:01:12,773 --> 02:01:13,774
What happened to you?

664
02:01:26,620 --> 02:01:27,621
Where did you get that scar?

665
02:01:40,342 --> 02:01:42,928
You. You've changed.

666
02:01:46,473 --> 02:01:47,599
Naturally.

667
02:01:50,144 --> 02:01:54,231
Tell me what happened. We're on
 opposite sides,

668
02:01:55,107 --> 02:01:56,775
but we're true friends.

669
02:01:57,818 --> 02:02:03,198
Friends? Then why did you let me
 survive the shame of my defeat?

670
02:02:04,408 --> 02:02:07,119
To defeat an enemy and to let him
 live appears to be a kind act,

671
02:02:07,286 --> 02:02:09,830
but it is cruel.

672
02:02:10,914 --> 02:02:13,333
Look at me!

673
02:02:14,251 --> 02:02:16,003
My Lord shamed me
 before everyone.

674
02:02:16,837 --> 02:02:18,881
See the scar left by
 the relentless beating?

675
02:02:21,175 --> 02:02:22,134
I curse you!

676
02:02:22,718 --> 02:02:26,972
Fool! Are you the
 great Hyoe Tadokoro?

677
02:02:30,267 --> 02:02:32,186
What you make of another's
 kindness is up to you.

678
02:02:32,644 --> 02:02:37,441
You and your Lord.
 Evidently you're both fools.

679
02:02:39,526 --> 02:02:43,906
To punish you so for losing
 to an enemy...

680
02:02:45,407 --> 02:02:48,577
Even I do not dare such a thing.

681
02:02:48,869 --> 02:02:50,496
I'm the Princess. It's me.

682
02:02:50,662 --> 02:02:51,705
Stop.

683
02:02:53,248 --> 02:02:55,834
I appreciate your loyalty,
 but this is it.

684
02:02:59,046 --> 02:03:00,547
I want to die with dignity.

685
02:03:02,049 --> 02:03:06,512
Your Highness, this Rokurota
 cannot apologize enough.

686
02:03:07,554 --> 02:03:11,850
You endured so much
 and it was all in vain.

687
02:03:12,935 --> 02:03:17,439
You're wrong, Rokurota.
 I had a good time.

688
02:03:21,068 --> 02:03:24,154
The happiness of these days
 I would have

689
02:03:24,279 --> 02:03:26,740
never known living in the castle.

690
02:03:29,076 --> 02:03:31,120
I saw people as they really are...

691
02:03:32,412 --> 02:03:40,462
I saw their beauty and their
 ugliness with my own eyes.

692
02:03:43,215 --> 02:03:46,677
Rokurota, I thank you.

693
02:03:48,846 --> 02:03:53,976
- I can now die without regret.
 - Your Highness!

694
02:03:55,978 --> 02:03:57,062
Rokurota.

695
02:03:59,064 --> 02:04:02,442
That Fire Festival was fun.

696
02:04:05,612 --> 02:04:07,030
I like that song.

697
02:04:11,493 --> 02:04:24,506
The life of a man

698
02:04:26,467 --> 02:04:34,600
Burn it with the fire

699
02:04:36,560 --> 02:04:47,196
The life of an insect

700
02:04:48,655 --> 02:04:57,706
Throw it into the fire

701
02:04:59,750 --> 02:05:11,637
Ponder and you'll see

702
02:05:13,013 --> 02:05:21,480
The world is dark

703
02:05:23,482 --> 02:05:34,451
And this floating world is a dream

704
02:06:43,061 --> 02:06:51,320
The life of a man

705
02:06:54,865 --> 02:07:02,581
Burn it with the fire

706
02:07:08,295 --> 02:07:09,296
Let's burn it!

707
02:07:12,674 --> 02:07:13,592
Turn the horses!

708
02:07:17,012 --> 02:07:18,722
Turn them, I said!

709
02:07:31,985 --> 02:07:34,154
He's mad! Get them!

710
02:08:05,602 --> 02:08:09,064
Hurry, Rokurota! Take the Princess!

711
02:08:21,076 --> 02:08:23,662
She is a great leader...
 serve her well.

712
02:08:26,540 --> 02:08:27,374
Hyoe!

713
02:08:29,460 --> 02:08:32,629
Don't die in vain!
 If you wish, follow us!

714
02:08:37,718 --> 02:08:38,385
Come!

715
02:09:11,919 --> 02:09:12,920
Forgive this traitor!

716
02:11:26,303 --> 02:11:30,891
Damn. When I got to Hayakawa
 with the gold,

717
02:11:32,559 --> 02:11:35,354
I imagined I'd be so happy.

718
02:11:42,569 --> 02:11:44,696
We're lucky to have our heads.

719
02:11:47,116 --> 02:11:50,452
Let's stay friends.

720
02:11:53,372 --> 02:11:59,586
We risked death together, we'll stay
 friends back at the village.

721
02:12:22,985 --> 02:12:24,069
Stray horses.

722
02:12:39,293 --> 02:12:41,128
Gold!

723
02:12:59,146 --> 02:13:00,272
This is all mine.

724
02:13:00,647 --> 02:13:02,441
What? Give me one of them.

725
02:13:03,525 --> 02:13:04,943
I found them first.

726
02:13:05,694 --> 02:13:11,784
You are greedy. You said we
 should split everything 50/50.

727
02:13:12,034 --> 02:13:13,619
That was then, this is now.

728
02:13:15,078 --> 02:13:17,289
You shithead.

729
02:14:15,889 --> 02:14:19,226
You. Are you from the Akizuki clan?

730
02:14:20,018 --> 02:14:24,356
No, we're just peasants.

731
02:14:25,482 --> 02:14:29,528
I don't get it.
 Peasants with all this gold?

732
02:14:34,450 --> 02:14:35,284
Arrest them!

733
02:14:49,006 --> 02:14:54,344
Let's stay friends in heaven too.

734
02:15:19,620 --> 02:15:23,457
Matashichi! Tahei! Look up!

735
02:15:33,175 --> 02:15:35,302
What? It's me.

736
02:15:35,803 --> 02:15:39,681
No wonder.
 Even I didn't recognize you.

737
02:15:40,808 --> 02:15:43,644
Your armor becomes you.

738
02:15:46,814 --> 02:15:48,106
Rokurota Makabe.

739
02:15:50,901 --> 02:15:52,861
You look even more handsome.

740
02:16:01,662 --> 02:16:06,792
You don't recognize
 your Princess Yuki?

741
02:16:11,588 --> 02:16:14,424
The mute. The mute girl.

742
02:16:54,006 --> 02:16:56,383
Matashichi. Tahei.

743
02:16:59,052 --> 02:17:02,181
You two went through a lot for us.

744
02:17:03,474 --> 02:17:09,104
However, that gold is an indispensable
 fund to restore Akizuki.

745
02:17:10,147 --> 02:17:14,234
Not I, not even the Princess
 can take it.

746
02:17:16,195 --> 02:17:19,907
I hope you will be satisfied
 with this. Here.

747
02:17:25,704 --> 02:17:29,458
Split it fairly. No fighting.

748
02:17:59,113 --> 02:18:02,199
You keep this.

749
02:18:03,283 --> 02:18:04,910
No you keep it.

750
02:18:05,911 --> 02:18:07,079
But...

751
02:18:07,246 --> 02:18:08,413
Don't worry about it.

752
02:18:25,139 --> 02:18:34,898
The End
