1
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,200
I had the craziest dream last night.

2
00:03:59,642 --> 00:04:01,552
I was dancing the White Swan.

3
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:06,512
It was different choreography, though.
It was more like the Bolshoi's.

4
00:04:10,524 --> 00:04:12,154
It was the prologue,

5
00:04:12,183 --> 00:04:14,973
when Rothbart casts his spell.

6
00:04:24,275 --> 00:04:27,395
Look how pink. So pretty...

7
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:30,195
Pretty!

8
00:04:30,236 --> 00:04:34,258
- You're in a good mood.
- He promised to feature me more this season.

9
00:04:34,298 --> 00:04:36,468
Well, he certainly should.

10
00:04:36,507 --> 00:04:38,397
You've been there long enough,

11
00:04:38,435 --> 00:04:41,287
and you're the most dedicated
dancer in the company.

12
00:04:45,557 --> 00:04:46,649
Up.

13
00:04:48,489 --> 00:04:49,519
- What's that?
- What?

14
00:04:49,557 --> 00:04:50,717
There.

15
00:04:54,529 --> 00:04:55,169
Nothing.

16
00:04:59,701 --> 00:05:01,091
You're sure you don't want me
to come with you?

17
00:05:04,392 --> 00:05:05,282
You're a sweet girl.

18
00:06:19,451 --> 00:06:20,531
Did you see Beth today?

19
00:06:20,561 --> 00:06:22,803
I can't believe she's back.

20
00:06:22,843 --> 00:06:26,193
- Of course she's back.
- What, she can't take a hint?

21
00:06:26,222 --> 00:06:29,424
The company is broke.
No one comes to see her anymore.

22
00:06:29,464 --> 00:06:32,114
Oh, nobody actually comes
to see ballet full stop.

23
00:06:32,153 --> 00:06:35,535
That's not true. I heard The Royal
had one of their best seasons yet.

24
00:06:35,565 --> 00:06:37,485
He just needs to try something new.
That's all.

25
00:06:37,514 --> 00:06:40,186
No, someone new.

26
00:06:41,525 --> 00:06:44,355
- Like who?
- Like someone who's not approaching menopause.

27
00:06:44,385 --> 00:06:45,827
It's sad.

28
00:06:45,857 --> 00:06:47,487
What's sad?

29
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,728
Beth's such a beautiful dancer.

30
00:06:53,757 --> 00:06:55,297
Yeah, so is my grandmother.

31
00:06:56,549 --> 00:06:59,839
- Well Fonteyn danced into her fifties.
- Yeah, we know.

32
00:07:06,669 --> 00:07:07,259
Great.

33
00:07:07,299 --> 00:07:09,791
Thought I'd fucking missed my stop.

34
00:07:09,831 --> 00:07:12,251
It's a hell-fit all the way from 79th.

35
00:08:03,988 --> 00:08:05,548
Beautiful as always, Nina.

36
00:08:05,578 --> 00:08:07,810
Relax.

37
00:08:12,528 --> 00:08:15,430
And one, and two,
and three, and four.

38
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,950
Stop, John.
One second.

39
00:08:35,052 --> 00:08:36,742
Okay, take position.

40
00:08:36,772 --> 00:08:40,724
And one, and two,
and three, and up.

41
00:08:40,764 --> 00:08:44,186
And one, and two,
and three, and four.

42
00:08:57,057 --> 00:08:57,487
Hello, dear.

43
00:09:05,527 --> 00:09:07,159
We all know the story.

44
00:09:07,199 --> 00:09:09,909
Virginal girl, pure and sweet,

45
00:09:09,939 --> 00:09:12,579
trapped in the body of a swan.

46
00:09:12,607 --> 00:09:16,089
She desires freedom

47
00:09:16,119 --> 00:09:19,061
that only true love can break the spell.

48
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:27,402
Her wish is nearly granted
in the form of a Prince.

49
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:31,603
But before he can declare his love,

50
00:09:31,643 --> 00:09:37,725
The lustful twin, the Black Swan,
tricks and seduces him.

51
00:09:42,202 --> 00:09:47,604
Devastated,
the White Swan leaps off a cliff,

52
00:09:47,633 --> 00:09:52,565
killing herself.
And in death...

53
00:09:52,594 --> 00:09:55,396
finds freedom.

54
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:03,977
- Good morning, company.
- Good morning.

55
00:10:05,936 --> 00:10:08,268
<i>We will open our season
with Swan Lake.</i>

56
00:10:08,298 --> 00:10:10,498
Done to death, I know.

57
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:12,097
But not like this.

58
00:10:12,126 --> 00:10:16,988
We strip it down,
make it visceral and real.

59
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:21,880
A new production
needs a new Swan Queen.

60
00:10:23,608 --> 00:10:25,630
A fresh face to present to the world.

61
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:32,862
But... Which of you
can embody both Swans?

62
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,232
The White, and the Black.

63
00:10:42,914 --> 00:10:45,254
All the soloists I tapped:

64
00:10:46,122 --> 00:10:48,364
Go to your scheduled rehearsals
this afternoon.

65
00:10:51,174 --> 00:10:52,974
And the girls I didn't tap:

66
00:10:55,336 --> 00:10:57,286
Meet me in the principals' studio at 5:00.

67
00:10:57,314 --> 00:10:58,764
Thank you.

68
00:11:03,365 --> 00:11:04,045
All right.

69
00:11:04,085 --> 00:11:06,757
- Let's go. Did we do left side?
- Yes, mistress.

70
00:11:44,282 --> 00:11:44,872
Fuck! Fuck!

71
00:11:50,933 --> 00:11:51,573
What?

72
00:13:32,477 --> 00:13:35,279
If I was only casting the White Swan,
she'd be yours.

73
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:38,299
But I'm not.

74
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:41,081
Maestro, Odile's coda, please.

75
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:42,851
Now show me your Black Swan, Nina.

76
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:09,484
Not so controlled.
Seduce us.

77
00:14:09,513 --> 00:14:12,785
Not just the Prince, but the court,
the audience, the entire world.

78
00:14:12,825 --> 00:14:15,977
Come on,
like a spider spinning a web.

79
00:14:16,017 --> 00:14:18,467
Attack it, attack it!
Come on!

80
00:14:29,968 --> 00:14:30,578
Well...

81
00:14:30,608 --> 00:14:32,898
- Good of you to join us.
- Sorry...

82
00:14:32,936 --> 00:14:34,788
Girls, this is Lily.

83
00:14:34,819 --> 00:14:38,399
Straight off the plane from San Francisco.
She's filling Rebecca's old spot.

84
00:14:38,428 --> 00:14:40,090
- Hey.
- Get warmed up.

85
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:40,970
No, it's okay.

86
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:42,180
I'm good.

87
00:14:44,748 --> 00:14:45,538
Should I go again?

88
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:48,460
No, thanks, Nina.
I've seen enough.

89
00:14:52,192 --> 00:14:54,052
Veronica, the White Swan variation.

90
00:14:58,063 --> 00:14:58,943
Come on, come on, come on, please.

91
00:14:58,982 --> 00:15:01,872
All right, Maestro.

92
00:15:01,902 --> 00:15:04,604
Two, three...

93
00:16:11,323 --> 00:16:11,863
So how'd it go?

94
00:16:13,852 --> 00:16:15,854
You were late, so I called
Susie in the office.

95
00:16:15,895 --> 00:16:19,035
An audition! I can't believe
he just sprang that on you.

96
00:16:19,063 --> 00:16:21,245
So?

97
00:16:21,275 --> 00:16:23,065
It was fine.

98
00:16:23,105 --> 00:16:25,045
Just fine?

99
00:16:27,567 --> 00:16:28,697
Oh, sweetheart...

100
00:16:31,265 --> 00:16:32,527
You tell me about it.

101
00:17:26,836 --> 00:17:27,976
Nina, everything all right?

102
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:29,015
I'm fine.

103
00:17:43,918 --> 00:17:44,638
Almost done.

104
00:17:44,668 --> 00:17:46,838
You're working yourself too hard.

105
00:17:49,207 --> 00:17:52,449
- We all have off days.
- That girl, um, barged in.

106
00:17:52,479 --> 00:17:54,319
I'm sure she didn't mean to.

107
00:17:57,550 --> 00:18:02,562
For a starter, if I hadn't taken you to each of
your classes, you'd have been completely lost.

108
00:18:02,601 --> 00:18:05,071
I'm going to talk to him tomorrow.
I'm going to tell him I finished it.

109
00:18:05,109 --> 00:18:06,529
You don't need to lie.

110
00:18:07,672 --> 00:18:09,302
You won't convince him
one way or the other.

111
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:14,192
Oh, sweetheart.

112
00:18:16,691 --> 00:18:17,881
I know it's disappointing.

113
00:18:19,484 --> 00:18:21,564
When you start getting older,
there's all this

114
00:18:22,753 --> 00:18:25,335
ridiculous pressure.
God knows I understand.

115
00:18:27,335 --> 00:18:28,445
But it's all right.

116
00:18:29,843 --> 00:18:31,365
No matter what.

117
00:18:33,215 --> 00:18:36,075
You'll probably get to dance
the part of the cat again.

118
00:18:37,397 --> 00:18:39,457
That's such a wonderful part.

119
00:18:39,496 --> 00:18:42,206
Or maybe he'll make you a big swan.

120
00:18:42,235 --> 00:18:46,167
Either way, you'll shine.

121
00:18:48,366 --> 00:18:48,836
You know...

122
00:18:50,318 --> 00:18:51,658
Everything will be better
in the morning.

123
00:18:54,426 --> 00:18:55,948
It always is.

124
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:00,358
Sweet girl.

125
00:19:26,634 --> 00:19:27,324
Yes, Nina?

126
00:19:27,353 --> 00:19:28,633
Do you have a minute?

127
00:19:32,544 --> 00:19:34,634
- Now's not a good time. I get it.
- Now is perfect.

128
00:19:37,606 --> 00:19:38,566
So...

129
00:19:41,614 --> 00:19:43,566
I just wanted to tell you that

130
00:19:43,606 --> 00:19:46,486
I practiced the coda last night and

131
00:19:46,525 --> 00:19:48,375
I finished.

132
00:19:53,515 --> 00:19:54,697
I thought you should know.

133
00:19:54,738 --> 00:19:58,548
Okay, Nina, listen. Honestly,
I don't care about your technique.

134
00:19:58,577 --> 00:20:01,529
- You should know that by now.
- Yeah, but yesterday...

135
00:20:01,569 --> 00:20:02,699
No.
Anyway...

136
00:20:02,739 --> 00:20:05,149
I've already chosen Veronica.
Sorry.

137
00:20:05,187 --> 00:20:07,919
Sorry.

138
00:20:09,189 --> 00:20:09,999
Okay, thank you.

139
00:20:13,381 --> 00:20:13,901
That's it?

140
00:20:13,941 --> 00:20:16,431
You're not going to
try and change my mind?

141
00:20:18,422 --> 00:20:19,832
You must have thought
it was possible.

142
00:20:19,861 --> 00:20:23,121
Otherwise, what are you
doing here all dolled up?

143
00:20:25,683 --> 00:20:27,323
I came to ask for the part.

144
00:20:32,373 --> 00:20:32,793
Well...

145
00:20:32,823 --> 00:20:35,753
The truth is...

146
00:20:35,792 --> 00:20:39,694
When I look at you,
all I see is the White Swan.

147
00:20:39,723 --> 00:20:43,935
Yes, you're beautiful,
fearful, fragile.

148
00:20:44,635 --> 00:20:45,755
Ideal casting.

149
00:20:47,977 --> 00:20:51,107
But the Black Swan?
It's a hard fucking job to dance both.

150
00:20:52,235 --> 00:20:53,807
I can dance the Black Swan, too.

151
00:20:53,837 --> 00:20:54,937
Really?

152
00:20:54,977 --> 00:20:58,037
In four years,
every time you dance,

153
00:20:58,066 --> 00:21:02,918
I see obsess getting each and every move
perfectly right, but I never see you lose yourself.

154
00:21:04,087 --> 00:21:07,039
Ever.
All that discipline for what?

155
00:21:11,278 --> 00:21:12,480
- I just want to be perfect.
- You what?

156
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,290
I want to be perfect.

157
00:21:18,271 --> 00:21:20,441
Perfection is not just about control.

158
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:24,072
It's also about letting go.

159
00:21:24,102 --> 00:21:28,732
Surprise yourself so you can
surprise the audience. Transcendence.

160
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:30,982
And very few have it in them.

161
00:21:31,012 --> 00:21:33,592
I think I do have it in me.

162
00:21:41,824 --> 00:21:42,434
You bit me?

163
00:21:42,464 --> 00:21:45,534
I can't believe you bit me!

164
00:21:45,573 --> 00:21:47,143
I'm sorry.

165
00:21:47,173 --> 00:21:49,355
Man, that fucking hurt!

166
00:22:06,338 --> 00:22:06,968
What?

167
00:22:06,998 --> 00:22:09,178
Why's she always staring at me?

168
00:22:11,739 --> 00:22:13,539
Hey, it's been posted.

169
00:22:14,688 --> 00:22:16,128
Hey, it's up!

170
00:22:21,529 --> 00:22:22,881
Veronica.

171
00:22:25,071 --> 00:22:25,921
Congratulations.

172
00:22:41,274 --> 00:22:42,394
Hey!

173
00:22:43,753 --> 00:22:44,623
Why would you say that?

174
00:22:46,332 --> 00:22:47,824
Your idea of some sick joke?

175
00:22:47,865 --> 00:22:49,225
What?

176
00:22:50,883 --> 00:22:51,693
Fuck you.

177
00:23:06,017 --> 00:23:06,657
Hey, Nina!

178
00:23:06,697 --> 00:23:08,127
Congratulations!

179
00:23:14,617 --> 00:23:15,897
Congratulations.

180
00:23:15,906 --> 00:23:17,368
You're so beautiful.

181
00:23:19,498 --> 00:23:20,348
Congratulations.

182
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,900
<i>- Hello?
- Hi.</i>

183
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,882
<i>What is it?
What's wrong?</i>

184
00:23:40,913 --> 00:23:42,483
I'm fine.

185
00:23:44,632 --> 00:23:46,024
He picked me, Mom.

186
00:23:49,402 --> 00:23:50,362
Do you hear me?

187
00:23:50,392 --> 00:23:53,244
<i>- For Swan Lake?
- I'm going to be Swan Queen!</i>

188
00:23:55,464 --> 00:23:56,704
Mom!

189
00:23:56,743 --> 00:23:59,175
I'll be home soon.
I just wanted to let you know.

190
00:24:00,235 --> 00:24:01,275
<i>- I love you.
- I love you, too.</i>

191
00:24:36,481 --> 00:24:37,141
Mom?

192
00:24:40,832 --> 00:24:41,882
Mom, are you in your room?

193
00:25:15,717 --> 00:25:16,507
Nina?

194
00:25:16,547 --> 00:25:17,977
Are you home?

195
00:25:30,748 --> 00:25:32,268
Nina, when you get out
I'm in the kitchen.

196
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:35,720
Come on, sweetie.

197
00:25:40,011 --> 00:25:42,451
My daughter, the Swan Queen.

198
00:25:47,412 --> 00:25:50,422
It's our favorite.
Vanilla with strawberry filling.

199
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:52,022
Oh, Mom, not too big.

200
00:25:52,052 --> 00:25:53,992
Oh, that's way, way too much.

201
00:25:54,032 --> 00:25:56,112
- It's a celebration. It's just this once.
- Mom...

202
00:25:57,194 --> 00:25:58,614
My stomach's still in knots.

203
00:26:01,342 --> 00:26:02,092
Fine.

204
00:26:02,122 --> 00:26:03,954
Fine.

205
00:26:03,984 --> 00:26:05,234
Then it's garbage!

206
00:26:05,264 --> 00:26:07,484
No, Mom, don't.
I'm sorry.

207
00:26:14,836 --> 00:26:18,956
I'm just...
I'm just so proud of you.

208
00:26:20,748 --> 00:26:21,728
It looks so yummy.

209
00:27:34,008 --> 00:27:35,108
Okay, okay.

210
00:27:35,137 --> 00:27:36,607
Thank you.
Thank you.

211
00:27:36,646 --> 00:27:38,698
Thank you, Nina.

212
00:27:38,729 --> 00:27:40,479
That's very nice.

213
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:42,668
Very nice.

214
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:47,470
But I knew the White Swan
wouldn't be a problem.

215
00:27:47,509 --> 00:27:51,201
The real work will your
metamorphosis into her evil twin.

216
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,980
And I know I saw
a flash of her yesterday.

217
00:27:56,532 --> 00:27:58,292
So get ready to give me
more of that bite.

218
00:28:20,796 --> 00:28:21,606
Excellent.

219
00:28:22,514 --> 00:28:27,636
That evil force is pulling you that you
can't escape. That's just out of your control.

220
00:28:28,616 --> 00:28:33,288
So you sense it, you get aware of it more:
"It's taking me, it's taking me."

221
00:28:33,327 --> 00:28:35,987
A little bit more desperate.

222
00:28:36,745 --> 00:28:40,767
Right, and you can maybe go up a little bit
and then come down, and then...

223
00:28:40,807 --> 00:28:42,067
That's it.

224
00:29:17,093 --> 00:29:18,413
Watch the way she moves.

225
00:29:19,975 --> 00:29:23,755
Imprecise,
but effortless.

226
00:29:26,115 --> 00:29:27,265
She's not faking it.

227
00:29:27,295 --> 00:29:36,387
Gorgeous!
Okay, that's beautiful.

228
00:29:36,417 --> 00:29:38,267
Let's start again from the beginning.

229
00:29:47,506 --> 00:29:50,178
You'll room with Beth from now on,
so be considerate.

230
00:29:50,219 --> 00:29:51,549
Thanks, Susie.

231
00:29:52,428 --> 00:29:53,998
Those are for you, from Mr. Leroy.

232
00:29:54,038 --> 00:29:55,980
They're beautiful.

233
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:15,282
I'll be back in a second.

234
00:30:18,874 --> 00:30:19,644
Let me come back to you, please.

235
00:30:23,522 --> 00:30:23,994
Let's go.

236
00:30:29,916 --> 00:30:31,246
Ready to be thrown to the wolves?

237
00:30:31,276 --> 00:30:34,906
We need our cash,
so please don't forget to smile.

238
00:30:34,934 --> 00:30:39,266
Ladies and gentlemen, please,
may I have your attention?

239
00:30:41,255 --> 00:30:41,817
Good evening.

240
00:30:41,848 --> 00:30:44,698
Let me make this
very important announcement.

241
00:30:44,726 --> 00:30:50,958
You all had had the chance and
the privilege to be enchanted, transported,

242
00:30:50,957 --> 00:30:53,759
and even sometimes devastated,
by the performances

243
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:55,800
of this true artist of our company.

244
00:30:55,799 --> 00:30:58,809
She's been a crucial
inspiration to my work.

245
00:30:58,847 --> 00:31:02,629
A role model to all dancers,
and even more than that,

246
00:31:02,669 --> 00:31:05,651
a deeply appreciated
presence on our stage.

247
00:31:05,691 --> 00:31:07,781
You all know who I am talking about.

248
00:31:07,821 --> 00:31:11,121
Ladies and gentlemen, Beth Macintyre.

249
00:31:16,581 --> 00:31:17,573
But as we all know,

250
00:31:17,603 --> 00:31:19,983
every great career
has to come to an end.

251
00:31:20,023 --> 00:31:24,875
Beth is retiring at the end of season.

252
00:31:26,393 --> 00:31:29,213
She will be giving her
farewell performance as Melpomene,

253
00:31:29,245 --> 00:31:31,765
the role she originated
in my first ballet.

254
00:31:34,353 --> 00:31:35,825
My little princess,

255
00:31:35,855 --> 00:31:39,125
we honor you.
You will be greatly missed,

256
00:31:39,874 --> 00:31:42,216
and never forgotten.

257
00:31:42,257 --> 00:31:46,317
<i>But as we bid adieu to one star,
we welcome another.</i>

258
00:31:47,347 --> 00:31:50,337
<i>We're opening our season
with my new version of Swan Lake.</i>

259
00:31:50,377 --> 00:31:55,349
Taking the role of our new Swan Queen,
the exquisite Nina Sayers.

260
00:32:01,009 --> 00:32:03,719
You'll soon have the pleasure
of seeing her perform,

261
00:32:03,758 --> 00:32:11,212
but right now, let's please raise a glass:
To all of us. To Beth. To Nina.

262
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:14,330
To beauty.

263
00:32:32,312 --> 00:32:33,172
Just a second.

264
00:32:42,476 --> 00:32:43,366
Just a second!

265
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,520
Come on!
I'm about to burst!

266
00:33:13,389 --> 00:33:14,839
Hey, it's you!

267
00:33:14,869 --> 00:33:17,451
I don't think we ever
officially met.

268
00:33:17,481 --> 00:33:20,141
- I'm Lily.
- Hi, I'm Nina.

269
00:33:20,169 --> 00:33:22,351
Yes, our new Swan Queen.

270
00:33:22,392 --> 00:33:23,952
- Here, hold this.
- Yeah, sure.

271
00:33:25,391 --> 00:33:29,063
You must be so excited.

272
00:33:30,923 --> 00:33:32,513
Are you freaking out?

273
00:33:32,551 --> 00:33:33,581
- Yeah...
- Yeah?

274
00:33:35,823 --> 00:33:36,663
Oh, it's okay.

275
00:33:36,693 --> 00:33:38,523
Oh, I'd be losing my mind.

276
00:33:38,563 --> 00:33:40,785
I should get back...

277
00:33:40,825 --> 00:33:42,525
No, no, no, come on, stay.

278
00:33:42,554 --> 00:33:44,354
Keep me company.

279
00:33:48,055 --> 00:33:48,845
Excuse me.

280
00:33:51,434 --> 00:33:52,236
Oh, there you are.
Come on.

281
00:33:57,977 --> 00:34:00,917
Hey. They tried to eat you alive,
but here you are.

282
00:34:02,506 --> 00:34:03,226
You did well.

283
00:34:03,266 --> 00:34:04,638
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

284
00:34:05,918 --> 00:34:06,728
Where are you going?

285
00:34:06,757 --> 00:34:09,077
Upper west side.

286
00:34:09,106 --> 00:34:10,888
Stop at my place for a drink.
It's on the way.

287
00:34:10,919 --> 00:34:14,679
Thomas, you need to say hello
to Karen Holloway.

288
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:19,120
A minute more of ass-kissing.
I'll be back. Wait for me here, all right?

289
00:34:22,071 --> 00:34:23,161
Hello, Karen!

290
00:35:05,507 --> 00:35:06,337
Beth!

291
00:35:08,455 --> 00:35:10,267
I'm so sorry to hear
you're leaving the company.

292
00:35:12,627 --> 00:35:14,117
What did you do to get this role?

293
00:35:17,469 --> 00:35:20,159
He always said you were
such a frigid little girl.

294
00:35:20,187 --> 00:35:23,609
What did you do to make
him change his mind?

295
00:35:23,639 --> 00:35:27,771
Did you suck his cock?

296
00:35:27,781 --> 00:35:29,531
Not all of us have to.

297
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:33,711
You fucking whore!

298
00:35:33,742 --> 00:35:37,112
You're a fucking little whore!

299
00:35:37,151 --> 00:35:38,561
Whoa, what's going on here?

300
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:41,722
Hey, I need to talk to you.

301
00:35:41,762 --> 00:35:43,892
- You're drunk. You should go home.
- I need to talk to you.

302
00:35:43,921 --> 00:35:47,613
No! Don't you do that!
Don't you dismiss me like that!

303
00:35:50,132 --> 00:35:52,794
My little princess, please.
Pull it together.

304
00:35:54,593 --> 00:35:56,203
- Come.
- I'm coming by later.

305
00:35:56,233 --> 00:36:00,915
I have something for you.
It's a token of my appreciation.

306
00:36:00,944 --> 00:36:03,676
- Right.
- You make the most of it, Nina.

307
00:36:04,916 --> 00:36:06,236
Don't worry. It's typical.

308
00:36:12,176 --> 00:36:15,038
Please. I thought it'd be good
to talk about the role.

309
00:36:15,069 --> 00:36:16,379
Drown this a little.

310
00:36:16,408 --> 00:36:18,658
I don't want there to be
any boundaries between us.

311
00:36:18,697 --> 00:36:20,749
- No, me neither.
- Good.

312
00:36:20,779 --> 00:36:25,149
So...
You got a boyfriend?

313
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:27,390
No.

314
00:36:29,319 --> 00:36:31,269
Have you had many in the past?

315
00:36:32,631 --> 00:36:33,341
A few.

316
00:36:33,381 --> 00:36:35,031
But no one serious.

317
00:36:39,882 --> 00:36:40,892
You're not a virgin are you?

318
00:36:44,423 --> 00:36:45,093
No.

319
00:36:45,123 --> 00:36:47,333
So there's nothing
to be embarrassed about.

320
00:36:52,544 --> 00:36:54,584
And you enjoy making love?

321
00:36:56,435 --> 00:36:56,935
Excuse me?

322
00:36:56,974 --> 00:36:59,124
Come on, sex.

323
00:36:59,154 --> 00:37:00,554
Do you enjoy it?

324
00:37:03,546 --> 00:37:05,416
We need to be able
to talk about this.

325
00:37:13,455 --> 00:37:15,217
I've got a little homework
assignment for you.

326
00:37:15,248 --> 00:37:19,710
Go home and touch yourself.

327
00:37:21,748 --> 00:37:22,818
Live a little.

328
00:37:26,989 --> 00:37:29,679
Well it's late.
Lots of work tomorrow.

329
00:37:29,718 --> 00:37:32,610
The doorman will
find a cab for you.

330
00:37:37,169 --> 00:37:39,991
Sounds like quite an evening.
I wish I could have been there.

331
00:37:40,021 --> 00:37:41,561
You know I asked.

332
00:37:41,589 --> 00:37:43,359
I know you did.
Susie told me.

333
00:37:43,402 --> 00:37:46,272
Guess he wanted you
all to himself.

334
00:37:46,311 --> 00:37:47,431
But why?

335
00:37:47,461 --> 00:37:49,853
Don't blame him.

336
00:37:52,302 --> 00:37:53,312
Where'd you get these?

337
00:37:53,351 --> 00:37:55,171
They're fake.

338
00:37:57,343 --> 00:37:59,593
Fooled me.

339
00:38:06,043 --> 00:38:06,883
I can do it.

340
00:38:10,665 --> 00:38:14,097
He must have been
by your side all night.

341
00:38:14,127 --> 00:38:17,597
Showing you off.

342
00:38:19,847 --> 00:38:21,587
- Oh, Nina...
- It's just a rash.

343
00:38:21,627 --> 00:38:23,787
Rash?
What are you talking about?

344
00:38:23,816 --> 00:38:25,398
It was worse a few days ago.
It's fine already.

345
00:38:25,429 --> 00:38:27,559
- You've been scratching yourself again.
- No I haven't.

346
00:38:27,598 --> 00:38:29,508
Mom!

347
00:38:29,547 --> 00:38:30,989
This disgusting habit...

348
00:38:32,659 --> 00:38:34,439
Jesus Christ, I thought
you were done with this, Nina.

349
00:38:35,778 --> 00:38:37,480
Shrugs.
You'll keep wearing the shrugs.

350
00:38:37,521 --> 00:38:38,871
Sit down.
You have the white one,

351
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:40,930
and the pink one.
And that'll hide it.

352
00:38:40,959 --> 00:38:45,671
And then I'll dig out that expensive
coverup. We still have some.

353
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:47,640
No one will see it.

354
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:49,282
Mom, please,

355
00:38:49,322 --> 00:38:53,552
It's the role, isn't it?
It's all this pressure.

356
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:55,452
I knew it'd be too much.
I knew it.

357
00:39:00,301 --> 00:39:00,723
You're all right.

358
00:39:03,514 --> 00:39:04,094
You'll be all right.

359
00:41:07,112 --> 00:41:08,852
Beth's in the hospital.

360
00:41:09,622 --> 00:41:11,914
She had an accident.

361
00:41:11,924 --> 00:41:13,614
Oh no!

362
00:41:13,634 --> 00:41:14,084
Beth?

363
00:41:21,993 --> 00:41:22,593
What happened?

364
00:41:25,076 --> 00:41:26,936
She walked into the street
and got hit by a car.

365
00:41:29,546 --> 00:41:30,186
You know what?

366
00:41:32,216 --> 00:41:33,936
I'm almost sure
she did it on purpose.

367
00:41:35,838 --> 00:41:36,458
How do you know?

368
00:41:37,498 --> 00:41:41,180
Because everything Beth does comes
from within, from some dark impulse.

369
00:41:43,308 --> 00:41:45,088
I guess that's what makes her
so thrilling to watch.

370
00:41:46,437 --> 00:41:47,709
So dangerous.

371
00:41:49,419 --> 00:41:51,149
Even perfect at times.

372
00:41:54,610 --> 00:41:56,460
But also so damned destructive.

373
00:41:58,792 --> 00:42:00,602
Was it right after we saw her?

374
00:42:01,631 --> 00:42:04,511
Wait, wait, wait.
This has nothing to do with you.

375
00:42:05,539 --> 00:42:08,651
It's not your problem,
so don't let yourself be distracted.

376
00:42:08,691 --> 00:42:11,883
This is your moment, Nina.

377
00:42:11,923 --> 00:42:14,263
Don't let it go.

378
00:43:43,756 --> 00:43:44,996
What are you doing?

379
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:27,570
Nina?

380
00:45:28,972 --> 00:45:30,932
Sweetie, are you ready for me?

381
00:45:40,684 --> 00:45:43,904
And...
Come on!

382
00:45:43,943 --> 00:45:46,435
Forget about control, Nina.
I want to see passion.

383
00:45:47,466 --> 00:45:48,866
Come on.

384
00:45:52,296 --> 00:45:54,306
Stiff like a dead corpse.
Let it go.

385
00:45:54,336 --> 00:45:57,598
Let it go.
Let it go.

386
00:45:57,638 --> 00:45:59,448
And again.

387
00:45:59,777 --> 00:46:03,057
Feels like you have your diaphragm

388
00:46:03,085 --> 00:46:05,807
is in a bit of a contraction?

389
00:46:05,848 --> 00:46:06,968
I'm okay.

390
00:46:11,419 --> 00:46:14,669
Breathe in to this hand.
Breathe in to this hand.

391
00:46:14,697 --> 00:46:16,769
Breathe in, all the way.
Good.

392
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,470
And exhale.

393
00:46:21,981 --> 00:46:25,211
<i>Does it feel jammed in the front
every time you plie?</i>

394
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:26,712
Sometimes, not always.

395
00:46:30,251 --> 00:46:32,161
- One more pull, okay?
- Okay.

396
00:46:37,471 --> 00:46:37,941
- Is that okay?
- Yeah.

397
00:46:58,706 --> 00:47:00,926
David,
can I ask you a question?

398
00:47:01,355 --> 00:47:03,567
Honestly,
would you fuck that girl?

399
00:47:06,146 --> 00:47:07,446
No.

400
00:47:07,476 --> 00:47:08,508
No one would.

401
00:47:09,538 --> 00:47:10,698
Nina...

402
00:47:10,728 --> 00:47:13,418
Your dancing is just as frigid...

403
00:47:15,446 --> 00:47:16,828
Fuck!

404
00:47:20,970 --> 00:47:22,800
We're still working here, please.
Lights!

405
00:47:22,829 --> 00:47:24,249
The lights!

406
00:47:25,721 --> 00:47:26,351
Thank you!

407
00:47:27,381 --> 00:47:30,981
Okay, guys, you can go.
Thanks for your patience.

408
00:47:31,742 --> 00:47:32,922
No, no, you stay.
You stay.

409
00:47:35,530 --> 00:47:36,510
Have fun, you two.

410
00:47:40,442 --> 00:47:41,472
Okay.

411
00:47:41,512 --> 00:47:42,682
Come here.

412
00:47:42,722 --> 00:47:43,934
Come, come, come, come.

413
00:47:46,663 --> 00:47:47,863
I'll be the Prince.

414
00:48:08,688 --> 00:48:10,348
Let it go. Let it go.

415
00:48:31,202 --> 00:48:32,042
Feel my touch.

416
00:48:32,081 --> 00:48:33,221
Respond to it.

417
00:48:33,251 --> 00:48:34,511
Come on.

418
00:48:47,671 --> 00:48:50,003
Open your mouth.
Open it. Open up.

419
00:49:16,736 --> 00:49:17,936
That was me seducing you,

420
00:49:17,976 --> 00:49:20,668
when it needs to be
the other way around.

421
00:49:21,698 --> 00:49:22,818
Please...

422
00:49:46,341 --> 00:49:47,711
Who is that?

423
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:48,882
Hey.

424
00:49:51,212 --> 00:49:52,742
You okay?

425
00:49:54,494 --> 00:49:55,714
You can't smoke in here.

426
00:49:56,444 --> 00:50:00,024
Well, I won't tell if you won't.

427
00:50:03,354 --> 00:50:04,404
So...

428
00:50:04,444 --> 00:50:07,276
The big day's getting closer
and closer, huh?

429
00:50:08,565 --> 00:50:11,827
Well, I can't wait.
I think you're going to be amazing.

430
00:50:13,966 --> 00:50:14,326
Thanks.

431
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:32,570
So...

432
00:50:32,610 --> 00:50:34,220
Do  you want to talk about it?

433
00:50:35,970 --> 00:50:38,020
It's that hard to.

434
00:50:39,709 --> 00:50:41,809
Leroy playing
a little too rough for you?

435
00:50:42,741 --> 00:50:44,051
Come on, Nina.
He's a prick.

436
00:50:44,091 --> 00:50:46,121
He's brilliant.

437
00:50:46,749 --> 00:50:50,541
Sure, but it's not like
he's all warm and fuzzy.

438
00:50:51,811 --> 00:50:53,481
What you don't know is...

439
00:50:56,203 --> 00:50:58,603
Someone's hot for teacher!

440
00:50:59,994 --> 00:51:02,724
Oh, come on, it's okay.
I don't blame you.

441
00:51:02,753 --> 00:51:04,143
I should go home.

442
00:51:04,183 --> 00:51:06,895
Nina, come on.
I'm just playing around.

443
00:51:07,935 --> 00:51:09,485
Nina!

444
00:52:30,348 --> 00:52:33,608
Sweetie?
What are you doing in there?

445
00:53:01,841 --> 00:53:02,381
Again.

446
00:53:35,697 --> 00:53:36,687
Again.

447
00:53:48,549 --> 00:53:50,269
Do you have any corrections?

448
00:53:55,379 --> 00:53:57,429
Lily told me that
she saw you crying.

449
00:53:59,391 --> 00:54:00,931
That you were very upset

450
00:54:00,961 --> 00:54:02,861
and that I should
take it easy on you.

451
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:04,422
I didn't tell her that.

452
00:54:04,453 --> 00:54:06,853
Maybe you need a little break.

453
00:54:06,892 --> 00:54:09,762
A day or two. Or maybe a month.
What do you think?

454
00:54:09,790 --> 00:54:10,972
She shouldn't have said anything.

455
00:54:11,013 --> 00:54:13,133
No, you shouldn't be
whining in the first place.

456
00:54:13,172 --> 00:54:13,922
I didn't.

457
00:54:17,624 --> 00:54:18,764
You could be brilliant.

458
00:54:18,804 --> 00:54:20,704
But you're a coward.

459
00:54:20,742 --> 00:54:23,044
Sorry.

460
00:54:23,075 --> 00:54:25,535
No, stop saying that!
That's exactly what I'm talking about.

461
00:54:25,574 --> 00:54:27,094
Stop being so fucking weak.

462
00:54:27,124 --> 00:54:28,526
Again!

463
00:54:41,948 --> 00:54:42,378
Lily...

464
00:54:42,417 --> 00:54:45,497
Oh, look who's decided
to grace us with her presence.

465
00:54:45,526 --> 00:54:46,458
I need to talk to you.

466
00:54:46,488 --> 00:54:47,408
Okay.

467
00:54:47,438 --> 00:54:48,898
Now.

468
00:54:50,277 --> 00:54:50,767
Shut up.

469
00:54:50,797 --> 00:54:52,019
Come on.

470
00:54:56,148 --> 00:54:56,598
What's up?

471
00:54:56,628 --> 00:54:59,240
You told Thomas about last night?

472
00:55:00,939 --> 00:55:03,831
Oh, yeah. I ran into him in the morning and
he said you guys were having some trouble.

473
00:55:03,872 --> 00:55:04,962
Why would he talk to you?

474
00:55:04,991 --> 00:55:07,651
Oh, excuse me, your highness.

475
00:55:07,690 --> 00:55:11,542
I just told him you're working your ass off
and I think you'll be great.

476
00:55:11,582 --> 00:55:12,482
Well you shouldn't have.

477
00:55:16,883 --> 00:55:17,353
Okay.

478
00:55:50,506 --> 00:55:51,788
Has he tried anything with you?

479
00:55:56,317 --> 00:55:57,969
He has a reputation.

480
00:56:01,818 --> 00:56:05,140
I have a right to be concerned, Nina.
You've been staying late so many nights.

481
00:56:05,170 --> 00:56:09,292
Rehearsing. I just hope
he isn't taking advantage, that's all.

482
00:56:09,331 --> 00:56:10,731
He's not.

483
00:56:10,771 --> 00:56:12,381
Good.

484
00:56:15,233 --> 00:56:17,043
I just don't want you to make
the same mistake I did.

485
00:56:18,771 --> 00:56:19,171
Thanks.

486
00:56:20,690 --> 00:56:21,372
Not like that.

487
00:56:22,693 --> 00:56:24,733
I just mean as far as
my career was concerned.

488
00:56:24,772 --> 00:56:25,672
What career?

489
00:56:29,694 --> 00:56:31,394
The one I gave up to have you.

490
00:56:33,705 --> 00:56:34,745
I'm twenty-eight.

491
00:56:34,774 --> 00:56:36,164
So?

492
00:56:36,844 --> 00:56:38,034
Only that...

493
00:56:40,176 --> 00:56:41,096
Only what?

494
00:56:41,126 --> 00:56:42,756
Nothing.

495
00:56:42,794 --> 00:56:44,024
- What?
- Nothing.

496
00:56:47,776 --> 00:56:48,756
How is your skin?

497
00:56:48,786 --> 00:56:50,868
Fine.

498
00:56:50,898 --> 00:56:52,548
- Are you leaving it alone?
- Mm-hmm.

499
00:56:55,776 --> 00:56:56,336
Let me see.

500
00:57:01,537 --> 00:57:02,839
- Take off your shirt.
- No.

501
00:57:16,161 --> 00:57:16,531
Can I help you?

502
00:57:21,102 --> 00:57:21,892
Who was that?

503
00:57:21,932 --> 00:57:23,472
It was no one.

504
00:57:25,641 --> 00:57:26,253
It was no one.

505
00:57:31,571 --> 00:57:32,071
Hello?

506
00:57:36,883 --> 00:57:37,583
What are you doing here?

507
00:57:37,623 --> 00:57:39,575
I just came by to apologize.

508
00:57:39,615 --> 00:57:41,815
You're right. I should have never
spoken to him about you.

509
00:57:41,843 --> 00:57:44,025
- Sweetheart.
- Give me a second.

510
00:57:44,056 --> 00:57:45,716
- Your dinner...
- Mom, please.

511
00:57:48,005 --> 00:57:49,285
Oh, she's a trip.

512
00:57:49,294 --> 00:57:50,686
How do you know where I live?

513
00:57:52,127 --> 00:57:53,217
I have my ways.

514
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:57,637
Jesus, relax.
I got it from Susie in the office.

515
00:57:58,957 --> 00:58:02,209
Look, I feel really shitty about what I did,
and I really want to make it up to you.

516
00:58:02,219 --> 00:58:04,489
So how about I take you out to dinner?

517
00:58:05,537 --> 00:58:08,019
- I don't think...
- Okay, that's fine.

518
00:58:08,049 --> 00:58:10,269
What about drinks?

519
00:58:10,309 --> 00:58:11,949
Sweetie, you need to rest.

520
00:58:11,978 --> 00:58:14,180
- Jesus.
- Wait.

521
00:58:16,030 --> 00:58:16,860
What are you doing?

522
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:19,029
I'm going out.

523
00:58:19,068 --> 00:58:20,610
What?
Nina!

524
00:58:20,641 --> 00:58:23,311
You're on the stage tomorrow.

525
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:26,532
I can't believe he calls her that.

526
00:58:26,572 --> 00:58:29,162
- It's so gross.
- I think it's sweet.

527
00:58:29,191 --> 00:58:31,011
Little Princess?

528
00:58:31,050 --> 00:58:33,482
- He probably calls every girl that.
- No way.

529
00:58:33,523 --> 00:58:35,503
That's just for Beth.

530
00:58:35,542 --> 00:58:40,154
Well, I bet he'll be calling you
Little Princess any day now.

531
00:58:40,184 --> 00:58:41,704
I don't know about that.

532
00:58:41,732 --> 00:58:44,964
Oh, sure he will.
Just got to let him lick your pussy.

533
00:58:46,624 --> 00:58:48,764
Cheeseburger, extra bloody.

534
00:58:48,803 --> 00:58:50,615
<i>Mmm, dankeschön.</i>

535
00:58:52,006 --> 00:58:53,906
Let me know
if that's juicy enough for you.

536
00:58:53,944 --> 00:58:55,746
Oh, I will.

537
00:58:57,756 --> 00:58:59,506
You have enough cheese?

538
00:58:59,546 --> 00:59:01,918
No, but you do.

539
00:59:04,596 --> 00:59:05,306
Enjoy.

540
00:59:15,199 --> 00:59:15,859
All right.

541
00:59:22,749 --> 00:59:24,059
Wanna spruce up?

542
00:59:24,089 --> 00:59:27,201
What, I carry a spare

543
00:59:27,241 --> 00:59:30,461
in case I wake up
somewhere unexpected.

544
00:59:34,481 --> 00:59:35,881
So how is he?

545
00:59:38,563 --> 00:59:39,653
Thomas.

546
00:59:41,521 --> 00:59:42,651
I wouldn't know.

547
00:59:42,681 --> 00:59:46,073
- Oh, come on.
- I really don't want to talk about that.

548
00:59:48,183 --> 00:59:48,965
Okay.

549
00:59:50,805 --> 00:59:53,725
You really need to relax.

550
01:00:01,127 --> 01:00:02,207
One for you,

551
01:00:02,237 --> 01:00:04,197
one for me.

552
01:00:05,545 --> 01:00:09,407
Oh, and don't worry. It's pure, I promise.
I brought it with me straight from San Francisco.

553
01:00:12,116 --> 01:00:12,808
What is it?

554
01:00:12,849 --> 01:00:14,899
Are you kidding?

555
01:00:16,607 --> 01:00:18,137
You've never rolled?

556
01:00:20,459 --> 01:00:23,719
Oh, relax. Here.
It'll loosen you up.

557
01:00:25,601 --> 01:00:27,721
Wait till you see the night sky.

558
01:00:31,651 --> 01:00:32,901
How long does it last?

559
01:00:32,931 --> 01:00:35,421
A couple hours, tops.

560
01:00:40,391 --> 01:00:41,671
It's okay.

561
01:00:41,700 --> 01:00:44,332
Okay.

562
01:01:46,551 --> 01:01:47,813
Nina, hi!

563
01:01:47,844 --> 01:01:54,376
I thought we could use some company.
So this is Tom and this is Jerry.

564
01:01:54,404 --> 01:01:58,064
- Actually it's Andrew.
- Tom.

565
01:01:58,103 --> 01:02:01,765
- I have to go...
- Oh, no you can't go. I just got us some drinks.

566
01:02:02,973 --> 01:02:04,083
I shouldn't...

567
01:02:04,123 --> 01:02:05,905
We're on the stage tomorrow.

568
01:02:05,936 --> 01:02:08,036
So what are you going to do?
Go home to Mommy?

569
01:02:12,187 --> 01:02:13,407
Come on, live a little.

570
01:02:18,277 --> 01:02:19,467
It's just a couple hours, right?

571
01:02:20,797 --> 01:02:21,907
Tops.

572
01:02:26,237 --> 01:02:26,847
Cheers.

573
01:02:29,139 --> 01:02:30,439
You haven't told me who you are.

574
01:02:31,429 --> 01:02:32,819
I'm a dancer.

575
01:02:32,848 --> 01:02:34,398
No, I mean your name.

576
01:02:36,041 --> 01:02:37,411
- Oh. Nina.
- So are you two sisters?

577
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:38,370
- Yes.
- No.

578
01:02:38,379 --> 01:02:42,711
- Blood sisters.
- We dance in the same company.

579
01:02:42,741 --> 01:02:46,451
Ah, ballerinas.
No wonder you two look alike.

580
01:02:46,490 --> 01:02:49,442
I see now.
Tom and Jerry here are gay lovers.

581
01:02:49,482 --> 01:02:51,432
- Very funny.
- I like to amuse myself.

582
01:02:51,471 --> 01:02:52,923
I've never been to the ballet.

583
01:02:52,963 --> 01:02:55,863
Then you are definitely not gay.

584
01:02:55,902 --> 01:02:57,812
I mean, it's kind of boring,
isn't it?

585
01:02:57,842 --> 01:02:58,964
- Be honest.
- No it's not.

586
01:02:58,994 --> 01:03:02,004
You know what?
It's just not for everyone.

587
01:03:02,033 --> 01:03:04,915
You should come sometime.
I can comp you tickets whenever you want.

588
01:03:04,945 --> 01:03:06,355
Yeah. Yeah.

589
01:03:07,214 --> 01:03:08,904
- Yeah, that would be neat. Thanks.
- Okay well...

590
01:03:08,944 --> 01:03:10,896
I think it's time for another round.

591
01:03:12,516 --> 01:03:14,386
Bottoms up.

592
01:03:18,846 --> 01:03:20,386
So what are you guys
working on now?

593
01:03:22,155 --> 01:03:24,517
Sorry.

594
01:03:26,456 --> 01:03:28,346
<i>Swan Lake.</i>

595
01:03:28,376 --> 01:03:29,648
Yeah?

596
01:03:29,678 --> 01:03:31,328
You know it?

597
01:03:31,348 --> 01:03:33,228
No, not really.

598
01:03:33,237 --> 01:03:34,267
Heard of it.

599
01:03:34,307 --> 01:03:35,699
What's it about?

600
01:03:37,049 --> 01:03:39,299
It's about a girl who gets
turned into a swan,

601
01:03:39,338 --> 01:03:41,910
and she needs love
to break the spell.

602
01:03:44,239 --> 01:03:46,591
But her prince falls for the wrong girl,

603
01:03:49,380 --> 01:03:50,630
and so she kills herself.

604
01:03:50,670 --> 01:03:53,872
It's not a happy ending then.

605
01:03:53,912 --> 01:03:57,042
It's beautiful, actually.

606
01:04:00,333 --> 01:04:01,293
Like you.

607
01:04:02,422 --> 01:04:03,372
Huh?

608
01:04:04,614 --> 01:04:05,634
I said you're beautiful.

609
01:04:09,663 --> 01:04:10,455
That's funny?

610
01:04:20,795 --> 01:04:22,767
Looks like someone might be rolling.

611
01:04:22,807 --> 01:04:26,087
All right, come on.
Come on, it's time to go dance.

612
01:04:48,729 --> 01:04:49,539
Nina!

613
01:05:26,154 --> 01:05:28,656
Hey, what the fuck?
Where you going?

614
01:05:51,770 --> 01:05:52,250
Nina!

615
01:05:53,660 --> 01:05:54,520
Where are you going?

616
01:07:18,302 --> 01:07:20,584
Do you have any idea
what time it is?

617
01:07:20,624 --> 01:07:22,474
Late?

618
01:07:25,272 --> 01:07:26,524
Where have you been?

619
01:07:27,335 --> 01:07:29,515
To the moon and back.

620
01:07:31,564 --> 01:07:33,956
- You've been drinking.
- Ding ding ding ding ding!

621
01:07:33,976 --> 01:07:35,686
- What else?
- Hmm?

622
01:07:35,704 --> 01:07:38,246
What else have you been doing?

623
01:07:39,936 --> 01:07:41,856
Oh, you want to know their names?

624
01:07:44,048 --> 01:07:47,748
- You need to sleep this off.
- There were two. Tom and Jerry.

625
01:07:47,766 --> 01:07:50,188
- Be quiet, Nina.
- And I fucked them both.

626
01:07:50,209 --> 01:07:52,279
Shut your mouth!

627
01:08:05,230 --> 01:08:06,410
- Don't come in here.
- What's this?

628
01:08:06,439 --> 01:08:09,811
It's called privacy.
I'm not twelve anymore.

629
01:08:09,851 --> 01:08:12,391
- You're not my Nina right now...
- Leave me alone!

630
01:10:09,798 --> 01:10:11,258
Winged girl.

631
01:11:08,408 --> 01:11:09,688
Why didn't you wake me up?

632
01:11:12,559 --> 01:11:13,429
I'm moving out.

633
01:11:18,171 --> 01:11:18,921
My music!

634
01:11:36,803 --> 01:11:38,213
Thomas, I am so sorry.

635
01:11:38,252 --> 01:11:40,132
Keep on going.

636
01:11:41,715 --> 01:11:42,785
Go get warmed up.

637
01:12:25,460 --> 01:12:26,020
That was good.

638
01:12:28,639 --> 01:12:29,511
Actually, really good.

639
01:12:29,542 --> 01:12:31,712
Okay, let's take ten.

640
01:12:39,941 --> 01:12:42,303
Look, he just wanted to mark it
and asked me to step up, okay?

641
01:12:43,223 --> 01:12:44,433
I overslept.

642
01:12:45,391 --> 01:12:48,133
Oops. But hey, at least
you had a good time, right?

643
01:12:48,174 --> 01:12:49,814
You put something in my drink.

644
01:12:49,843 --> 01:12:51,643
Yeah.

645
01:12:51,673 --> 01:12:53,345
And then you just
took off in the morning.

646
01:12:54,805 --> 01:12:55,525
In the morning?

647
01:12:55,565 --> 01:12:57,495
Yeah, you slept over.

648
01:13:00,056 --> 01:13:00,916
Um, no.

649
01:13:02,665 --> 01:13:05,317
Unless your name's Tom
and you had a dick.

650
01:13:07,915 --> 01:13:08,945
What, Nina?

651
01:13:14,667 --> 01:13:17,999
Did you have some sort of
lesbian wet dream about me?

652
01:13:18,029 --> 01:13:20,429
- Stop.
- Oh my God!

653
01:13:20,467 --> 01:13:23,779
Oh my God, you did!
You fantasized about me!

654
01:13:23,799 --> 01:13:26,219
- Shut up!
- Was I good?

655
01:15:09,446 --> 01:15:11,666
The final act.

656
01:15:11,665 --> 01:15:13,655
You're trying to dance.

657
01:15:16,037 --> 01:15:19,277
You've tasted your dream!
Touched it!

658
01:15:21,538 --> 01:15:23,638
Only to have it crushed!

659
01:15:26,986 --> 01:15:28,728
Your heart is broken,

660
01:15:28,769 --> 01:15:32,089
wounded.
Your life force fading.

661
01:15:32,127 --> 01:15:35,809
The blood drips.

662
01:15:37,808 --> 01:15:42,060
The Black Swan stole your love.
There is only one way to end the pain.

663
01:15:44,199 --> 01:15:47,701
You are not fearful,
but filled with acceptance.

664
01:15:49,950 --> 01:15:52,962
And you look down at Rothbart,

665
01:15:52,962 --> 01:15:54,082
and then at the Prince,

666
01:15:56,140 --> 01:15:59,192
and then, yes,
at the audience.

667
01:15:59,233 --> 01:16:02,323
And then you jump.

668
01:16:05,913 --> 01:16:07,973
Go ahead. Jump.
Jump!

669
01:16:19,234 --> 01:16:22,346
Okay, everybody get a drink of water,
then it's notes.

670
01:16:34,548 --> 01:16:35,738
You lost weight.

671
01:16:35,778 --> 01:16:37,388
Take off your shrug, please.

672
01:16:49,129 --> 01:16:49,879
Very good.

673
01:16:56,652 --> 01:16:58,142
Face front.
We're almost done.

674
01:17:02,404 --> 01:17:04,424
And that's it.
Okay.

675
01:17:04,453 --> 01:17:06,553
We're done.
Thank you very much.

676
01:17:09,304 --> 01:17:11,964
Georgina, I'm Lily.
Thomas sent me...

677
01:17:11,993 --> 01:17:14,805
Yes, we have to get you measured
for the Swan Queen costumes.

678
01:17:14,835 --> 01:17:15,965
What's she doing here?

679
01:17:18,123 --> 01:17:19,523
He made me your alternate.

680
01:17:21,646 --> 01:17:22,676
Look, it's just in case.

681
01:17:25,315 --> 01:17:27,797
Thomas.
Thomas.

682
01:17:27,817 --> 01:17:28,927
- Thomas.
- Yes?

683
01:17:28,956 --> 01:17:31,076
It can't be her.

684
01:17:31,115 --> 01:17:32,977
It can't be her.

685
01:17:33,007 --> 01:17:34,497
Okay, why don't you just go.
I'll catch up later.

686
01:17:34,527 --> 01:17:36,277
What's going on?

687
01:17:36,307 --> 01:17:39,349
Lily...
You made her my alternate?

688
01:17:40,887 --> 01:17:43,639
There's always an alternate.
Lily is the best choice.

689
01:17:43,680 --> 01:17:45,080
No, she wants my role.

690
01:17:45,109 --> 01:17:47,449
Every dancer in the world
wants your role.

691
01:17:47,479 --> 01:17:49,981
No, this is different.
She is after me.

692
01:17:50,011 --> 01:17:53,431
- She is trying to replace me.
- Nobody is after you.

693
01:17:53,469 --> 01:17:56,311
- No, please believe me...

694
01:17:58,861 --> 01:18:04,183
I know it's been a struggle.
But you just had a breakthrough this morning.

695
01:18:05,951 --> 01:18:10,583
Tomorrow is yours. Just give a great performance
and you won't have to worry about Lily or anybody else.

696
01:18:14,204 --> 01:18:15,214
Now go home and rest.

697
01:18:29,014 --> 01:18:30,934
From the vision again.

698
01:18:48,507 --> 01:18:49,069
What happened?

699
01:18:51,180 --> 01:18:55,162
I've got a life. I work too hard.
It's a big day tomorrow.

700
01:19:39,956 --> 01:19:41,246
I'm still working in here.

701
01:19:51,767 --> 01:19:53,257
Could you please
turn the lights back on?

702
01:19:59,408 --> 01:19:59,858
Hello?

703
01:21:48,187 --> 01:21:49,277
What are you doing here?

704
01:21:49,307 --> 01:21:51,217
I'm so sorry.

705
01:21:51,245 --> 01:21:53,547
I'm so sorry.

706
01:21:53,588 --> 01:21:58,158
I know how it feels now.
She's trying to replace me.

707
01:21:59,409 --> 01:22:00,779
What do I do?

708
01:22:02,837 --> 01:22:05,219
You stole my things?

709
01:22:05,250 --> 01:22:07,890
I was just trying to be perfect, like you.

710
01:22:10,738 --> 01:22:11,480
Perfect?

711
01:22:17,401 --> 01:22:18,631
I'm not perfect.

712
01:22:21,210 --> 01:22:22,130
I'm nothing.

713
01:22:25,092 --> 01:22:27,692
Nothing!

714
01:22:36,604 --> 01:22:37,904
Nothing, nothing!

715
01:23:24,961 --> 01:23:25,841
Sweet girl.

716
01:23:47,265 --> 01:23:47,745
Mommy?

717
01:23:53,126 --> 01:23:54,466
Sweet girl.
Sweet girl.

718
01:23:58,397 --> 01:24:00,627
Stop!

719
01:24:09,406 --> 01:24:10,288
What are you doing?

720
01:24:13,077 --> 01:24:13,697
Sweetie?

721
01:24:20,958 --> 01:24:22,170
Nina?

722
01:24:22,211 --> 01:24:23,961
Nina!

723
01:24:23,990 --> 01:24:25,260
Go away!

724
01:24:26,759 --> 01:24:27,711
Open the door!

725
01:24:27,751 --> 01:24:28,941
Go away!

726
01:24:37,751 --> 01:24:39,523
Open the door, Nina!

727
01:24:40,263 --> 01:24:41,663
Nina!

728
01:24:54,404 --> 01:24:54,974
Get out!

729
01:24:55,004 --> 01:24:57,246
- What's wrong with you?
- Get out!

730
01:24:57,287 --> 01:24:59,287
- Get out!
- What do you see?

731
01:24:59,326 --> 01:25:00,996
Get out!

732
01:25:39,772 --> 01:25:40,902
It's okay.

733
01:25:42,162 --> 01:25:43,012
I'm here.

734
01:25:47,083 --> 01:25:49,493
You were scratching all night.

735
01:25:49,532 --> 01:25:51,794
Where's my clock?

736
01:25:51,834 --> 01:25:54,124
- Don't worry about that.
- What time is it?

737
01:25:55,103 --> 01:25:57,405
- The show is tonight, I have to...
- No, no, no, no.

738
01:25:57,415 --> 01:25:58,695
Don't worry.

739
01:25:58,735 --> 01:26:01,715
I called the theater and I told them
you aren't feeling well.

740
01:26:01,743 --> 01:26:02,855
I have to go!

741
01:26:02,886 --> 01:26:04,446
- No. No, you don't.
- Let go of me.

742
01:26:07,435 --> 01:26:09,177
You're staying in here
until you feel better.

743
01:26:09,217 --> 01:26:10,697
Where is it?

744
01:26:12,395 --> 01:26:14,115
This role is destroying you.

745
01:26:15,808 --> 01:26:17,408
- Move. Move!
- Nina...!

746
01:26:17,437 --> 01:26:20,859
- What happened to my sweet girl?
- She's gone!

747
01:26:21,589 --> 01:26:23,869
Nina!
Oh, Nina!

748
01:26:24,827 --> 01:26:25,617
No, please!

749
01:26:25,647 --> 01:26:27,779
- You're not well!
- Let go of me!

750
01:26:27,819 --> 01:26:29,489
You can't handle this.

751
01:26:29,519 --> 01:26:31,349
I can't?

752
01:26:31,388 --> 01:26:34,430
I'm the Swan Queen.
You're the one who never left the corps.

753
01:26:36,009 --> 01:26:36,759
Nina!

754
01:26:53,232 --> 01:26:54,032
What are you doing here?

755
01:26:54,062 --> 01:26:55,292
Nina?

756
01:26:55,332 --> 01:26:57,234
She was supposed to be sick.

757
01:26:57,274 --> 01:26:58,924
Give us a minute.

758
01:27:04,315 --> 01:27:04,865
Are you okay?

759
01:27:04,904 --> 01:27:06,334
I'm fine.

760
01:27:09,626 --> 01:27:11,616
Nina.

761
01:27:13,394 --> 01:27:14,646
Nina.

762
01:27:14,677 --> 01:27:15,747
What?

763
01:27:15,786 --> 01:27:18,466
I've already asked Lily.

764
01:27:18,496 --> 01:27:20,448
Have you announced it?

765
01:27:24,236 --> 01:27:26,528
After Beth, do you really need
another controversy?

766
01:27:30,987 --> 01:27:32,599
I'm here, Thomas.

767
01:27:32,630 --> 01:27:34,100
I'm doing it.

768
01:27:40,310 --> 01:27:42,700
The only person
standing in your way is you.

769
01:27:42,739 --> 01:27:47,391
It's time to let it go.
Lose yourself.

770
01:28:02,544 --> 01:28:04,144
White Swan, up in ten.

771
01:28:58,101 --> 01:28:59,821
What are you doing?
You need to be upstage.

772
01:31:01,161 --> 01:31:02,061
You suck.

773
01:31:03,660 --> 01:31:05,080
Okay, Nina.

774
01:31:44,197 --> 01:31:44,897
What the fuck?

775
01:32:30,095 --> 01:32:31,985
- Are you okay?
- Nina, are you okay?

776
01:32:41,527 --> 01:32:42,827
Can you tell me
what the fuck happened?

777
01:32:46,588 --> 01:32:48,428
- It wasn't my fault. He dropped me.
- This is a fucking disaster.

778
01:32:56,697 --> 01:33:00,209
Rough start, huh?
Must have been pretty humiliating.

779
01:33:02,079 --> 01:33:03,289
Get out of my room.

780
01:33:03,318 --> 01:33:05,740
I'm worried about the next act.

781
01:33:07,639 --> 01:33:09,499
I'm just not sure you're feeling up to it.

782
01:33:09,529 --> 01:33:11,031
Stop.
Please stop.

783
01:33:11,071 --> 01:33:16,323
How about I dance the Black Swan for you?

784
01:33:18,602 --> 01:33:21,082
Leave me alone!

785
01:33:33,052 --> 01:33:33,682
My turn!

786
01:33:34,645 --> 01:33:35,305
My turn!

787
01:33:35,335 --> 01:33:37,085
My turn!

788
01:33:44,214 --> 01:33:45,896
It's my turn!

789
01:34:05,560 --> 01:34:06,980
Black Swan, places in five.

790
01:37:09,847 --> 01:37:11,727
Come on.

791
01:37:39,422 --> 01:37:41,242
Good job.
Fifteen to the last act.

792
01:38:27,080 --> 01:38:30,090
Hey.
You were amazing.

793
01:38:30,128 --> 01:38:33,850
Seriously, I know that things got
a little messed up between us,

794
01:38:33,880 --> 01:38:37,292
but I mean, holy shit,
you completely blew me away!

795
01:38:39,990 --> 01:38:41,920
Okay, well I guess that's it.

796
01:38:41,960 --> 01:38:43,702
So I'll let you finish.
Bye.

797
01:42:08,382 --> 01:42:09,472
Can you hear them?

798
01:42:09,512 --> 01:42:12,214
They love you!

799
01:42:12,254 --> 01:42:15,944
My little princess,
I always knew you had it in you.

800
01:42:15,972 --> 01:42:18,594
Come on.
Let's take you out.

801
01:42:24,826 --> 01:42:25,576
Go get some help.

802
01:42:25,605 --> 01:42:26,575
Go get some help!

803
01:42:26,605 --> 01:42:28,035
What did you do?

804
01:42:28,074 --> 01:42:29,196
What did you do?

805
01:42:29,237 --> 01:42:33,387
- I felt it.
- What?

806
01:42:33,426 --> 01:42:35,708
I felt perfect.

807
01:42:41,019 --> 01:42:42,719
I was perfect.

808
01:42:55,200 --> 01:42:57,540
Nina! Nina! Nina!
