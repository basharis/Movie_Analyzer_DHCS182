1
00:00:24,595 --> 00:00:28,868
PRISONERS

2
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:41,404
Our Father, Who art in heaven,

3
00:00:41,839 --> 00:00:43,921
Hallowed be Thy Name,

4
00:00:44,645 --> 00:00:46,496
Thy kingdom come,

5
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:50,751
Thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.

6
00:00:52,416 --> 00:00:55,175
Give us this day our daily bread,

7
00:00:55,373 --> 00:00:58,048
and forgive us our trespasses,

8
00:00:58,655 --> 00:01:01,966
as we forgive those
who trespass against us;

9
00:01:03,859 --> 00:01:09,690
lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

10
00:01:10,926 --> 00:01:15,228
For the kingdom, the power,
and the glory is yours,

11
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,880
now and forever.

12
00:01:19,022 --> 00:01:20,608
Amen.

13
00:01:50,169 --> 00:01:55,270
You know the most important thing
your Grandpa ever taught me. Mm?

14
00:01:58,232 --> 00:01:59,834
Be ready.

15
00:02:02,417 --> 00:02:05,931
Hurricane, flood,
whatever it ends up being.

16
00:02:07,275 --> 00:02:09,609
No more food gets delivered
to the grocery store,

17
00:02:09,644 --> 00:02:11,423
gas stations dry up…

18
00:02:12,063 --> 00:02:14,162
People just turn on
each another and uh…

19
00:02:15,829 --> 00:02:19,557
all of a sudden all that stands
between you and being dead is you.

20
00:02:25,677 --> 00:02:27,242
I'm proud of you son.

21
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:29,932
That was a nice shot.

22
00:03:26,278 --> 00:03:27,952
Okay. Come on, hon.
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

23
00:03:29,531 --> 00:03:32,536
I forgot something.
Hold on a second, Anna.

24
00:03:39,567 --> 00:03:41,178
Are we taking the truck?

25
00:03:41,213 --> 00:03:43,055
We're going across the street you dope.

26
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:52,057
— Come on.
— Hey, wait for your mother, please!

27
00:03:52,092 --> 00:03:53,714
— Give me a ride.
— Here.

28
00:03:56,856 --> 00:03:58,379
Oh, you're getting heavy.

29
00:03:58,414 --> 00:04:02,159
Um… Danny's Dad said
he'd sell me their old car.

30
00:04:02,194 --> 00:04:04,324
I got half of what I need
saved from the summer,

31
00:04:04,359 --> 00:04:06,007
I thought maybe—
— Forget it.

32
00:04:06,042 --> 00:04:08,725
I'm barely getting enough carpentry work
to keep up with the mortgage.

33
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,485
Well, why don't you rent out
Grandpa's old apartment house?

34
00:04:14,507 --> 00:04:16,529
Like I keep telling your
mother, it's an old building.

35
00:04:16,555 --> 00:04:17,951
It would cost a fortune to fix it up.

36
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:35,443
Ok, ok…

37
00:04:35,478 --> 00:04:37,054
They're here!

38
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:41,789
Hello!

39
00:04:41,824 --> 00:04:44,000
— Happy Thanksgiving!
— Happy Thanksgiving!

40
00:04:44,035 --> 00:04:46,170
Oh, for God's sake!
Keller, get the hell in here!

41
00:04:51,394 --> 00:04:53,509
Keller, you bring that poor deer you shot?

42
00:04:53,544 --> 00:04:54,274
This one's Ralph's.

43
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,452
Well, you killed it,
you take it into the kitchen.

44
00:05:02,512 --> 00:05:04,671
Alright, join.
Join.

45
00:05:06,136 --> 00:05:09,086
You are missing the game!

46
00:05:12,321 --> 00:05:14,017
Anna, come here…

47
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,275
Alright, you're in charge of this.

48
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:22,547
Us veterinarians make lousy butchers.

49
00:05:22,582 --> 00:05:24,074
No problem.

50
00:05:26,603 --> 00:05:28,829
Can I go outside with Joy?

51
00:05:28,864 --> 00:05:31,591
Uh… convince your brother
to go with you and you can.

52
00:05:34,053 --> 00:05:36,804
And wear a hat, please.
You're just getting over a cold.

53
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:38,555
Joy, you wear a hat too.

54
00:05:41,071 --> 00:05:43,320
Did you feel bad for that deer
when you shot it?

55
00:05:44,683 --> 00:05:47,129
Do you feel bad for cows
when you go to McDonald's?

56
00:05:48,626 --> 00:05:50,255
That's what my Dad says.

57
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:53,083
And the deer, if they have too many
babies and the babies starve anyway.

58
00:05:53,118 --> 00:05:55,073
You gotta keep the population down.
— Right.

59
00:05:56,524 --> 00:05:58,266
Did your Dad say that too?

60
00:05:59,929 --> 00:06:02,247
Hey, get away from that thing!

61
00:06:03,345 --> 00:06:05,178
Come on, let's go.

62
00:06:05,213 --> 00:06:07,473
— No.
— I said, let's go.

63
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:11,411
— Hey, hey, hey. Come on, let's go.
— No. Let me…

64
00:06:11,437 --> 00:06:12,744
— Let's go. Come on,
come on, come on.

65
00:06:13,987 --> 00:06:16,326
Wait. Did you hear that?

66
00:06:17,334 --> 00:06:19,142
Somebody's in there.

67
00:06:19,983 --> 00:06:22,475
Alright, I don't feel like
getting yelled at. Let's go.

68
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,873
Now the school board's telling me
there's no money

69
00:06:36,908 --> 00:06:38,599
for the marching band uniforms.

70
00:06:38,634 --> 00:06:40,854
These kids are wearing the same uniforms
they had when we went there,

71
00:06:40,881 --> 00:06:44,733
and they were old then.
They're marching right out of 1979.

72
00:06:45,045 --> 00:06:47,073
Why isn't he speaking to me?

73
00:06:47,623 --> 00:06:48,925
He doesn't speak.

74
00:06:50,566 --> 00:06:53,381
Cutie pie.
Oh, my gosh!

75
00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:59,307
He's fast. Woh.
He's so quick. Is that a slide?

76
00:06:59,342 --> 00:07:01,671
Thank y'all. Thank y'all.

77
00:07:04,467 --> 00:07:07,578
I got a surprise.

78
00:07:07,613 --> 00:07:09,366
— Yes!
— No.

79
00:07:12,845 --> 00:07:15,142
You gotta listen out for it,
cause this is not easy.

80
00:07:15,177 --> 00:07:18,178
Mom. Mommy, can I take
Joy to our house?

81
00:07:18,224 --> 00:07:19,507
Why?

82
00:07:19,542 --> 00:07:22,287
My red whistle.
She's gonna help me look for it.

83
00:07:22,322 --> 00:07:24,893
Oh, sweetheart, I think
that whistle is long gone.

84
00:07:24,928 --> 00:07:25,752
What whistle?

85
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:29,071
The emergency whistle Daddy gave me.
I lost it…

86
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:33,101
A hundred and thirty-three days ago.

87
00:07:34,743 --> 00:07:38,226
Well, if you wanna find a whistle,
you have to whistle for it.

88
00:07:38,713 --> 00:07:41,290
So we'll do Jingle Bells to find it.

89
00:07:45,889 --> 00:07:49,174
Jingle bells, Batman smells,
Robin laid an egg!

90
00:07:49,263 --> 00:07:53,094
The Batmobile lost a wheel
and the Joker got away! Yay!

91
00:07:54,357 --> 00:07:56,727
— Okay! Okay!
— You can go, alright?

92
00:07:56,777 --> 00:07:59,297
Just make sure you ask Ralph
to go with you, please.

93
00:08:01,303 --> 00:08:02,248
No looking in the basement.

94
00:08:02,274 --> 00:08:03,707
— I won't.
— Stay out of the basement.

95
00:08:05,841 --> 00:08:07,990
But I am taking requests from you, Keller.

96
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:09,975
— From me?
— Your day, your request.

97
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:12,198
Oh. Uh… the piano.

98
00:08:12,251 --> 00:08:14,018
No! No, no, no.
You all set?

99
00:08:14,984 --> 00:08:17,825
Wait, listen. He used to love this,
but he used to dress like Springsteen.

100
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,573
— Really?
— I loved Springsteen, yeah.

101
00:08:19,608 --> 00:08:21,099
Do you remember 'Jersey Girl'?

102
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:22,730
— Well, I ain't white…
— Yeah!

103
00:08:22,765 --> 00:08:26,433
And I like him too much.
But I'm too drunk to cover The Boss.

104
00:08:26,468 --> 00:08:27,961
Thank you.

105
00:08:27,996 --> 00:08:30,832
— Honey, what else?
— Um… nothing comes to mind, nothing.

106
00:08:30,867 --> 00:08:32,388
— Oh, oh. I know.
— What?

107
00:08:32,404 --> 00:08:34,341
He actually loves the
Star Spangled Banner.

108
00:08:34,358 --> 00:08:36,754
I know, I know.
Sings it in the shower, so.

109
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:39,630
— I do not!
— Yes, you do!

110
00:09:13,431 --> 00:09:15,014
Where are your sisters?

111
00:09:15,725 --> 00:09:17,177
I can't find them.

112
00:09:17,212 --> 00:09:19,720
Did you uh… did you go
to the house with them?

113
00:09:20,733 --> 00:09:22,450
No, what are you talking about?

114
00:09:22,485 --> 00:09:24,791
— Really?
— No.

115
00:09:24,826 --> 00:09:27,212
What? They were supposed
to come down earlier and get you.

116
00:09:27,238 --> 00:09:28,263
They didn't come get you?

117
00:09:28,298 --> 00:09:31,091
— No, we haven't since we ate.
— It's alright.

118
00:09:31,126 --> 00:09:33,042
Don't worry, they're
probably at our house.

119
00:09:47,027 --> 00:09:49,720
Anna? Joy?

120
00:09:55,133 --> 00:09:56,673
Girls?

121
00:10:16,081 --> 00:10:17,642
Girls!

122
00:10:17,793 --> 00:10:19,571
Put these dishes in here.

123
00:10:19,631 --> 00:10:21,515
They weren't outside,
it started raining.

124
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:23,729
Did you check over by the rear swing?

125
00:10:23,988 --> 00:10:25,436
Yeah.

126
00:10:25,913 --> 00:10:27,978
Well, they're getting
whooped when they get here.

127
00:10:28,004 --> 00:10:29,134
Sorry, Grace. I whoop kids.

128
00:10:29,169 --> 00:10:31,168
Wait, you said they
weren't there either.

129
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:32,920
Are they here?

130
00:10:33,158 --> 00:10:35,092
— No, they're not here!
— They weren't there?

131
00:10:35,122 --> 00:10:36,028
No, they're not at the house.

132
00:10:36,047 --> 00:10:37,487
— Were they there?
— No, they're not there.

133
00:10:37,513 --> 00:10:39,246
But I checked the entire house,
they're not here.

134
00:10:41,776 --> 00:10:44,572
— The… the RV.
— What RV?

135
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:46,379
Dad, there's this RV and
they were playing on it.

136
00:10:46,405 --> 00:10:48,222
There's… we thought that
there was someone inside.

137
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:52,135
Where? Where was it? Show me.

138
00:10:59,018 --> 00:11:00,958
Go that way,
we'll meet you at the other side.

139
00:11:09,305 --> 00:11:11,642
— Anna?
— Paul, seen my daughter walk by here?

140
00:11:11,677 --> 00:11:13,055
No. You got a problem?

141
00:11:16,909 --> 00:11:18,081
Anna?

142
00:11:18,263 --> 00:11:20,590
Here! Dad, it was
parked right here!

143
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:26,362
Anna? Anna?

144
00:11:27,864 --> 00:11:29,875
Hello? Hello?

145
00:11:29,957 --> 00:11:31,809
— Do you see 'em?
— No. Hello!

146
00:11:33,627 --> 00:11:35,362
I couldn't find them!

147
00:11:35,397 --> 00:11:38,018
— Were you messing around in this house?
— No!

148
00:11:38,053 --> 00:11:39,900
I told you not to come here.

149
00:11:39,935 --> 00:11:41,156
We weren't! They were just on the RV,
we go 'em off of it.

150
00:11:41,191 --> 00:11:42,815
Tell me everything you can
remember about that RV.

151
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:44,237
— Uh… there was a ladder on the back.

152
00:11:44,263 --> 00:11:45,222
Wait.
Police, please.

153
00:11:59,007 --> 00:12:00,990
Happy Thanksgiving.

154
00:12:01,025 --> 00:12:02,937
Thanks.

155
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:05,593
Do you have any of those um…
fortune cookie things?

156
00:12:05,628 --> 00:12:08,178
My boss told me cops
don't like fortune cookies.

157
00:12:09,629 --> 00:12:11,056
What year were you born in?

158
00:12:11,082 --> 00:12:13,488
Were you a dragon,
or a snake, or a horse…

159
00:12:13,523 --> 00:12:17,151
— I am a monkey.
— Oh, you're a monkey.

160
00:12:18,595 --> 00:12:20,579
You're very intelligent,

161
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:23,431
and you have an ability
to influence people.

162
00:12:23,963 --> 00:12:26,874
Maybe you could influence your boss
to lower the check a little bit.

163
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:31,442
No, I cannot. My boss is a rooster.

164
00:12:38,033 --> 00:12:41,386
So he's selfish and eccentric. That's…

165
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:50,742
<i>All units, all units, an RV was
reported matching the description.</i>

166
00:12:50,899 --> 00:12:53,694
<i>The vehicle was parked at
a rest stop off of Route 26,</i>

167
00:12:53,711 --> 00:12:57,280
<i>northbound, past exit 17.
Any available units?</i>

168
00:12:57,344 --> 00:12:59,549
<i>This is 12-12, responding.</i>

169
00:13:00,408 --> 00:13:01,977
<i>10-80 responding.</i>

170
00:13:02,046 --> 00:13:05,413
This is 13-40, I'm five minutes out.
Call in all respond units.

171
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:16,021
Hey! Don't move! Hey!

172
00:14:17,153 --> 00:14:20,290
Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

173
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:34,574
I got this side, take the right.

174
00:14:42,778 --> 00:14:44,125
Clear!

175
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,326
Clear!

176
00:14:54,514 --> 00:14:57,174
Alright. Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait! I got this.

177
00:15:19,988 --> 00:15:23,145
Hey. Hey. I see you in there.

178
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:25,069
Show me both your hands, right now.

179
00:15:25,104 --> 00:15:27,789
Hey! I see you in there.
Show me your hands!

180
00:15:30,172 --> 00:15:31,890
Both hands, right now!

181
00:15:33,207 --> 00:15:35,122
That's it, slow. Slow. Slow!

182
00:15:35,157 --> 00:15:38,107
Slow. Slowly, both hands.

183
00:15:39,176 --> 00:15:41,490
Both fucking hands!

184
00:15:43,321 --> 00:15:45,440
Walk! Walk!

185
00:15:50,123 --> 00:15:53,866
Get up! Get up!
Get up!

186
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:57,569
Show me those girls!

187
00:15:59,323 --> 00:16:03,159
Where are those girls?
Where are those girls?!

188
00:16:03,194 --> 00:16:04,601
Hey, give me a flashlight.

189
00:16:04,627 --> 00:16:07,061
Show me those girls.
Are they in the woods?

190
00:16:07,807 --> 00:16:09,615
You took them into the woods?

191
00:16:10,609 --> 00:16:12,681
Where did you put those girls?

192
00:16:14,904 --> 00:16:16,488
Did you hear me?

193
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:19,948
What the fuck is this guy on?

194
00:16:20,654 --> 00:16:23,324
— No, he's hiding something.
— He's fucking walking to the car.

195
00:16:23,359 --> 00:16:24,444
Get in the car.

196
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,372
Get in the fucking car!
Walk!

197
00:16:27,964 --> 00:16:29,227
Hey, call PSP.

198
00:16:29,261 --> 00:16:32,981
Tell 'em to send their sniff dogs
and seal off the whole area!

199
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:35,340
— Yeah.
— The entrance, all of it.

200
00:16:35,422 --> 00:16:37,537
— Alright.
— You, follow me.

201
00:16:38,548 --> 00:16:42,054
— No? They weren't playing on your RV?
— No.

202
00:16:47,941 --> 00:16:50,035
Okay, take a look at them again.

203
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:53,944
You don't recognize these girls?

204
00:16:53,979 --> 00:16:56,107
I didn't see them. May I sit down?

205
00:16:56,142 --> 00:16:58,078
What do you do in the RV?
Answer my question.

206
00:16:58,113 --> 00:17:00,023
— I sleep there.
— You sleep in there.

207
00:17:00,058 --> 00:17:02,571
You were sleeping out there, in the day?

208
00:17:02,989 --> 00:17:05,505
Why was the RV parked outside the house?

209
00:17:07,614 --> 00:17:10,061
I went for a drive.

210
00:17:10,096 --> 00:17:13,367
You went for a drive?
You weren't driving.

211
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:15,936
I know for a fact those girls
were playing outside your RV.

212
00:17:15,971 --> 00:17:17,657
You weren't driving, it was parked.

213
00:17:17,692 --> 00:17:18,685
Was it a special day?

214
00:17:18,711 --> 00:17:20,908
Were you planning on
taking little girls?

215
00:17:20,943 --> 00:17:22,568
— No.
— Have you done it before?

216
00:17:22,603 --> 00:17:24,243
No.

217
00:17:24,863 --> 00:17:26,696
— Did you ask them to come inside?
— No.

218
00:17:26,731 --> 00:17:29,395
Did you ask them to come inside the RV
and then you take them away?

219
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:31,295
— No.
— Did you put those girls somewhere?

220
00:17:31,358 --> 00:17:33,594
— May I sit down?
— Did you put those girls somewhere?

221
00:17:33,624 --> 00:17:35,820
— Please don't touch me.
— I know you put those girls somewhere.

222
00:17:37,304 --> 00:17:39,222
— Did you hide 'em?
— No.

223
00:17:39,257 --> 00:17:41,310
Where did you hide 'em?
Did you tie 'em up?

224
00:17:41,397 --> 00:17:43,627
Did you tie 'em up?
— Mmm…

225
00:17:43,898 --> 00:17:45,641
Huh?
Hey. Hey.

226
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:52,440
Look, I know you're a good guy, alright?
I know you're a decent guy.

227
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:54,431
I'm not trying to tell you that
you're doing anything bad.

228
00:17:54,463 --> 00:17:56,442
I'm just trying to get to
the right answers out of you, okay?

229
00:17:56,468 --> 00:17:58,106
The real ones.
That's all I want.

230
00:17:58,183 --> 00:18:01,545
Where do you usually park your RV, Alex?

231
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:04,068
— My aunt's house.
— Your aunt's house.

232
00:18:04,103 --> 00:18:08,569
She lets me park it in the back yard.
The grass don't grow back there anyway.

233
00:18:10,983 --> 00:18:15,217
It was my husband's.
It's for sale if you want it.

234
00:18:19,823 --> 00:18:21,567
No, thanks.

235
00:18:22,207 --> 00:18:24,875
Well, would you tell me what
you're doing on my property then?

236
00:18:27,818 --> 00:18:30,466
I'm just glad to know where he is.

237
00:18:31,059 --> 00:18:34,393
He's always home before dark.

238
00:18:35,491 --> 00:18:38,377
And I just don't understand,
that boy has never been in trouble,

239
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:39,790
not a day in his life.

240
00:18:43,317 --> 00:18:46,481
Uh… in the summer time he sleeps out
in the camper some, but

241
00:18:47,185 --> 00:18:50,827
 this time of year
he sleeps in here on a sofa bed.

242
00:19:00,186 --> 00:19:02,125
That's my husband.

243
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:06,168
We had a fight,jeez… five years ago.

244
00:19:08,505 --> 00:19:10,909
He walked out, didn't come back.

245
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:14,873
Alex loved him like a father.

246
00:19:17,941 --> 00:19:20,013
Where are Alex's real parents?

247
00:19:20,048 --> 00:19:24,341
My husband's brother and his girlfriend,
they died in a car accident

248
00:19:24,376 --> 00:19:26,730
when Alex was six.

249
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:28,891
Sorry to hear that.

250
00:19:38,491 --> 00:19:40,632
He doesn't have much.

251
00:19:47,122 --> 00:19:48,756
What do you got?

252
00:19:49,329 --> 00:19:50,707
Well, this thing's clean.

253
00:19:50,773 --> 00:19:53,255
I mean, it's filthy as shit,
but we didn't find anything.

254
00:19:53,422 --> 00:19:56,739
We didn't find any uh… wool fibers,
anything like that?

255
00:19:56,774 --> 00:20:01,139
The girls could be wearing some wool
gloves or wool hats, no cotton fibers?

256
00:20:01,497 --> 00:20:04,406
Well, if he was just using this thing
to transport them I might buy that,

257
00:20:04,446 --> 00:20:07,462
but if there had been struggle,
I would have found something.

258
00:20:07,568 --> 00:20:09,654
I'd start looking the woods,
by the rest stop.

259
00:20:10,917 --> 00:20:13,851
Yeah, half the uniformed cops
in the state are doing that right now.

260
00:20:15,151 --> 00:20:16,703
Hey, when you're done with this thing,

261
00:20:16,738 --> 00:20:18,780
can you send the crew
over to the aunt's house?

262
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:42,312
Anna!

263
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,852
Anna!

264
00:21:20,523 --> 00:21:22,926
Please, come in. I'm Franklin Birch.

265
00:21:22,961 --> 00:21:25,067
My wife's in here.

266
00:21:25,102 --> 00:21:31,234
Honey. This is Nancy.
Detective Loki is… honey?

267
00:21:38,946 --> 00:21:41,988
These photos are better than
the ones my husband gave you.

268
00:21:42,023 --> 00:21:44,179
You can see her eyes more clearly.

269
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:13,950
So did we pass?

270
00:22:15,046 --> 00:22:16,745
I'm sorry, what did you say?

271
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:22,234
The poly-thing… the like detector
we took this morning, did we pass?

272
00:22:23,705 --> 00:22:29,091
Oh, yeah. Yes, sorry.
Yes, we appreciate your cooperation.

273
00:22:31,213 --> 00:22:34,521
It's embarrassing, all the…
all this fuss.

274
00:22:35,575 --> 00:22:37,652
Everyone's gonna think we're crazy

275
00:22:37,673 --> 00:22:40,271
when those two come out of hiding,
wherever they are.

276
00:22:42,345 --> 00:22:44,990
Do you have some reason
to believe they ran away?

277
00:22:48,273 --> 00:22:50,287
No. They're happy.

278
00:22:53,772 --> 00:22:56,721
But they must have run away.

279
00:22:56,722 --> 00:22:59,951
I think they must have run away, right?

280
00:23:04,908 --> 00:23:09,263
Um… your police captain told me
that you've solved every case

281
00:23:09,288 --> 00:23:12,143
 that you've ever
been assigned, is that right?

282
00:23:19,407 --> 00:23:21,853
Sorry.

283
00:23:22,993 --> 00:23:27,741
I'm so sorry. Do you…
do you have children, Detective?

284
00:23:34,618 --> 00:23:36,823
I'm gonna find your daughter.

285
00:23:39,142 --> 00:23:43,311
We believe they came back here after
they left you at the Birch's yesterday.

286
00:23:43,346 --> 00:23:45,203
They were looking for
Anna's red whistle.

287
00:23:46,267 --> 00:23:49,576
Right.
I read your statement.

288
00:23:50,933 --> 00:23:52,714
I'm Detective Loki.

289
00:23:53,358 --> 00:23:56,411
I'm heading up the investigation
into your daughter's disappearance.

290
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:58,188
Please, sit down.

291
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,925
Uh… my… my son already
told you that the guy

292
00:24:02,957 --> 00:24:05,444
was inside the RV just watching them.
Right?

293
00:24:07,544 --> 00:24:09,786
We haven't found any
physical evidence in the RV,

294
00:24:10,426 --> 00:24:12,346
or his aunt's house where he lives.

295
00:24:12,985 --> 00:24:14,685
Nothing?

296
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,064
Alex Jones unfortunately
has the IQ of a ten year-old.

297
00:24:18,911 --> 00:24:22,075
There's no way that someone with the IQ
of a ten year-old could abduct two girls

298
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:23,638
in broad daylight and then…

299
00:24:24,403 --> 00:24:27,043
somehow make them disappear.

300
00:24:27,278 --> 00:24:29,748
Uh… well, how can he drive an RV?

301
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:32,609
I mean, if he can't
answer a question?

302
00:24:32,649 --> 00:24:34,785
Well, he has a legal
Pennsylvania license.

303
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,873
And he ran, right?

304
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:39,138
They said he tried to run away.
Why wo— uh… why…

305
00:24:39,538 --> 00:24:42,311
Why would…
why would he run?

306
00:24:42,529 --> 00:24:44,939
I just spent ten hours
questioning this boy, okay?

307
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:46,209
I hear what you're saying.

308
00:24:50,021 --> 00:24:52,182
Did-did you give him
a lie detector?

309
00:24:52,217 --> 00:24:54,108
You gave us a lie detector,
did you give him one?

310
00:24:54,143 --> 00:24:55,863
Sir, I understand what you're asking me.

311
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:56,752
Yes, we did.
— And?

312
00:24:56,767 --> 00:24:59,609
We gave him a lie detector,
and there's no way…

313
00:25:00,934 --> 00:25:03,617
A lie detector doesn't work
if you don't understand the questions.

314
00:25:03,663 --> 00:25:06,657
Well, maybe he wasn't on his own.

315
00:25:07,073 --> 00:25:10,077
How can he drive an RV
if he has an IQ of a ten year-old?

316
00:25:10,112 --> 00:25:12,083
Sir, sir, hey,
we are considering all possibilities.

317
00:25:12,118 --> 00:25:13,371
I don't think you are
considering all possibilities.

318
00:25:13,397 --> 00:25:14,600
I hear… I hear what you're saying.
Sir, sir…

319
00:25:14,635 --> 00:25:17,032
No, you listen to me! Just shut
the fuck up for a fucking second!

320
00:25:19,686 --> 00:25:21,398
This is what I'm gonna
need you to do for me.

321
00:25:21,424 --> 00:25:22,354
I need you to calm down.

322
00:25:24,425 --> 00:25:28,175
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Please listen to me for a second.

323
00:25:28,814 --> 00:25:31,570
Mr. Dover, I understand that
this is an incredibly hard time,

324
00:25:31,605 --> 00:25:34,707
but I have every uniformed police
officer in this state looking for Anna.

325
00:25:35,872 --> 00:25:39,135
I don't understand what any
of this means. They said he ran.

326
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:40,975
They said he tried to get away.

327
00:25:41,001 --> 00:25:43,911
I don't understand why
he would try to run away.

328
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:49,047
We're considering all
possibilities, Mr. Dover.

329
00:25:49,073 --> 00:25:50,604
I hear what you're saying.

330
00:25:50,639 --> 00:25:52,662
I'm not crossing anybody off my list.

331
00:25:52,697 --> 00:25:56,525
Just… let me do my job.

332
00:26:12,374 --> 00:26:15,481
— Hey! Detective!
— Shit.

333
00:26:17,215 --> 00:26:19,636
Hey! He stays in custody until
my daughter is found, right?

334
00:26:20,476 --> 00:26:21,750
Right?

335
00:26:21,785 --> 00:26:24,893
We have a forty-eight hour hold on him
until tomorrow unless we bring charges.

336
00:26:24,928 --> 00:26:27,387
Then charge him with something.
Charge him.

337
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:30,664
— Mr. Dover, I understand what you're suf—
— Detective… Detective,

338
00:26:30,701 --> 00:26:33,410
two little girls have gotta be worth
whatever little rule you gotta break

339
00:26:33,445 --> 00:26:35,045
to keep that asshole in custody.

340
00:26:35,406 --> 00:26:37,936
Now I know you can't promise me
anything, I understand that.

341
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:41,288
But I'm asking you to be sure,
be one hundred percent sure.

342
00:26:42,477 --> 00:26:43,928
Thank you.

343
00:26:45,272 --> 00:26:46,703
I appreciate it.

344
00:26:50,312 --> 00:26:53,197
Now, you're positive he's innocent,
but you wanna keep hold of him.

345
00:26:53,232 --> 00:26:54,811
Anna Dover's father was most…

346
00:26:54,846 --> 00:26:57,396
Hey, I get it, I understand.
But it's not gonna happen.

347
00:26:57,431 --> 00:26:58,896
You know, I'm just asking
for one more day.

348
00:26:58,931 --> 00:27:02,982
Fuck you. You find his daughter,
he'll forgive you,

349
00:27:03,017 --> 00:27:04,795
you don't, he's gonna hate you anyway.

350
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:06,541
So what's next?

351
00:27:07,165 --> 00:27:09,367
I'm knocking on doors all night.

352
00:27:09,402 --> 00:27:12,985
Yeah, well, you're coming up on 24 hours
missing and you have exactly shit.

353
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:14,635
Well, I've got nine
level 3 sex offenders

354
00:27:14,661 --> 00:27:16,589
living within a ten mile
radius of Fairmont Circle.

355
00:27:16,624 --> 00:27:18,121
So, if you'll—
— Go.

356
00:27:18,147 --> 00:27:19,419
— Yeah.
— Go.

357
00:27:31,467 --> 00:27:33,295
It's right here.

358
00:27:40,651 --> 00:27:42,634
Right, I'm thinking straight, okay?

359
00:27:44,106 --> 00:27:45,991
It's— oh, I ain't— look.
Look, I know you—

360
00:27:47,828 --> 00:27:51,117
Alright. You enjoy some German porn, uh?

361
00:28:28,838 --> 00:28:31,307
Father! Open up, it's the police!

362
00:29:08,968 --> 00:29:10,995
Father…

363
00:29:15,814 --> 00:29:17,458
Father.

364
00:29:22,489 --> 00:29:24,961
Do you mind if I take look around?

365
00:29:50,544 --> 00:29:52,790
Fucking drunk.

366
00:30:24,946 --> 00:30:26,861
What the fuck?

367
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:56,493
Wow.
Fuck. Oh, fuck.

368
00:32:06,398 --> 00:32:08,620
No! Please, don't! Oh, God!

369
00:32:09,284 --> 00:32:11,623
What's the name of your buddy
down there, huh? What's the name?

370
00:32:11,673 --> 00:32:13,940
— I don't know his name!
— You don't know his name?

371
00:32:13,981 --> 00:32:15,091
I don't know his name!

372
00:32:15,306 --> 00:32:18,186
Hey, you know I spent six years
in the Huntington Boys Home, Father.

373
00:32:18,761 --> 00:32:20,788
You know the Huntington
Boys Home, right? Huh?

374
00:32:20,814 --> 00:32:23,074
Finding a real fuck like you
is a real treat for me.

375
00:32:23,109 --> 00:32:26,056
— Now you tell me a fucking name.
— He didn't tell me his name!

376
00:32:26,091 --> 00:32:31,245
He came to me for confession.
He said he'd killed sixteen children.

377
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,878
He bragged about it!

378
00:32:32,913 --> 00:32:37,334
I convinced him to come back here.
He said he'd kill more.

379
00:32:37,369 --> 00:32:41,508
Sixteen children, huh?
Let's go, you fucking shit!

380
00:33:16,153 --> 00:33:18,464
— Hey.
— <i>They're letting him go.</i>

381
00:33:18,499 --> 00:33:19,234
What?

382
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:22,172
<i>The police said they're
letting him go today.</i>

383
00:33:22,207 --> 00:33:25,200
Okay. I'll take care of it.

384
00:33:26,947 --> 00:33:28,752
— Dad?
— Keep searching.

385
00:33:28,787 --> 00:33:30,271
Where are you going?!

386
00:33:37,851 --> 00:33:40,492
You have to write your whole name.

387
00:33:46,698 --> 00:33:48,853
That's better.

388
00:33:53,056 --> 00:33:56,906
Mm-hmm. Good job,
now give it to the man.

389
00:34:06,306 --> 00:34:08,527
Come on.

390
00:34:34,019 --> 00:34:36,565
I just wanna talk.
He's a free man, I'm a free man!

391
00:34:39,466 --> 00:34:41,998
Tell me what you did with them!

392
00:34:42,033 --> 00:34:44,651
— Tell me!
— They didn't cry until I left them.

393
00:34:44,701 --> 00:34:47,673
What did you say? What did you say?!
No, no! No, no, no!

394
00:35:07,759 --> 00:35:12,256
Now, I know your Dad
was a guard at Graterford,

395
00:35:12,305 --> 00:35:16,904
and I've got a daughter of my own, so
we're gonna pretend this never happened.

396
00:35:18,456 --> 00:35:21,825
Okay? And as for Alex Jones, he has
orders not to leave the commonwealth.

397
00:35:22,075 --> 00:35:23,895
What?

398
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:26,326
— Sir, I need you to go home.
— What?

399
00:35:26,361 --> 00:35:27,846
Alright? I need you to go home—

400
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:29,560
What about what I just fucking told you?

401
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,201
Why aren't you sending someone
to go arrest this guy?!

402
00:35:31,266 --> 00:35:33,886
Tell Detective Loki what you just told
me and he'll definitely look into it.

403
00:35:34,279 --> 00:35:35,499
Go ahead.

404
00:35:36,948 --> 00:35:39,720
That asshole you promised me
you'd keep in custody, right?

405
00:35:40,065 --> 00:35:41,949
And you didn't.

406
00:35:41,984 --> 00:35:43,847
And right now when I grabbed him
in the parking lot,

407
00:35:43,892 --> 00:35:46,489
he said right to my fucking face,
they didn't cry until I'd left them.

408
00:35:46,512 --> 00:35:48,022
Right to my fucking face!

409
00:35:48,367 --> 00:35:50,457
He said… he said that to you
in the parking lot just now?

410
00:35:50,503 --> 00:35:53,007
Right now, yeah! What did I just say?
In the parking lot!

411
00:35:53,504 --> 00:35:55,186
Before you grabbed me off.

412
00:35:56,963 --> 00:35:58,830
Did anyone else hear besides you?

413
00:35:59,425 --> 00:36:02,884
I don't know. He was quiet,
he… he said it to me.

414
00:36:02,919 --> 00:36:05,445
He wanted me to know.
— Are you sure he said that?

415
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,895
— What?
— Are you sure that's what he said?

416
00:36:07,930 --> 00:36:11,100
Jesus Christ, you think
I'm making this up?

417
00:36:11,135 --> 00:36:13,239
— No.
— Why would I make this up?

418
00:36:13,274 --> 00:36:15,999
— Hey, hey, hey.
— No, no, no! Why would I make this up?

419
00:36:16,034 --> 00:36:18,862
I'm not saying that to you,
I'm just asking you a couple questions.

420
00:36:18,897 --> 00:36:21,222
— I will talk to him. Okay?
— No, don't talk to him!

421
00:36:21,257 --> 00:36:22,856
— Mr. Dover—
— Arrest him!

422
00:36:26,627 --> 00:36:28,540
What did I fucking tell you?

423
00:36:28,575 --> 00:36:31,173
What did I tell you? One more day.

424
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:36,100
You're sure you didn't say anything to
Mr. Dover in the parking lot today?

425
00:36:38,353 --> 00:36:41,018
Anything he could have misinterpreted.

426
00:36:42,037 --> 00:36:43,876
I was right there,

427
00:36:43,961 --> 00:36:47,071
they didn't say anything to each other,
the man just attacked the boy.

428
00:36:48,725 --> 00:36:53,443
Nothing, like, get away from me,
or help? Or anything like that?

429
00:36:55,987 --> 00:36:57,659
No.

430
00:37:01,038 --> 00:37:02,930
Can I speak to Alex alone for a minute?

431
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:10,660
It's alright, sweetie.
I'll be right in the next room.

432
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:25,232
You love your aunt, don't you, Alex?

433
00:37:30,437 --> 00:37:32,306
Yes.

434
00:37:32,341 --> 00:37:34,527
You know if you know something
you're not telling us

435
00:37:34,528 --> 00:37:36,713
that she can go to jail
for a very long time.

436
00:37:37,333 --> 00:37:39,114
Do you want that for her?

437
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:43,172
After everything she's done for you?

438
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:45,857
No.

439
00:38:01,223 --> 00:38:03,734
Mr. Dover, this is Detective Loki.

440
00:38:03,769 --> 00:38:06,121
Have you arrested him?

441
00:38:06,156 --> 00:38:07,192
Yeah look, I've just come from Alex Jones,

442
00:38:07,218 --> 00:38:08,883
now he said he didn't say anything
to you in the parking lot.

443
00:38:08,918 --> 00:38:12,347
Now, I pushed him pretty hard
and he didn't budge.

444
00:38:12,382 --> 00:38:14,005
So look, we can't waste any more
time on this guy. Alright?

445
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,619
You're gonna have to trust me,

446
00:38:15,654 --> 00:38:17,537
I'll let you know if I have anything
new, alright, Mr. Dover? For—

447
00:38:20,007 --> 00:38:21,835
Fuckin' A.

448
00:38:36,709 --> 00:38:40,315
The zipper on her coat was broken,
and I told her it didn't matter

449
00:38:40,341 --> 00:38:43,044
cause we were just gonna
go right down the street.

450
00:38:43,769 --> 00:38:46,169
— Ralph, Ralph.
— Why hasn't she come home?

451
00:38:48,233 --> 00:38:52,044
It's been three days.
Why can't you make her come home?

452
00:38:53,338 --> 00:38:57,617
I don't understand.
I don't understand!

453
00:38:57,652 --> 00:38:59,978
It's been too long!

454
00:39:00,013 --> 00:39:02,936
Please make her come home!

455
00:39:08,052 --> 00:39:09,787
Please bring her.
— How many of these…

456
00:39:09,813 --> 00:39:11,421
how many of these… ?
— I don't know!

457
00:39:11,794 --> 00:39:14,302
Ssh. Okay, it's alright. Just take one.

458
00:39:19,536 --> 00:39:24,431
No. I don't wanna sleep!
I don't wanna go to sleep.

459
00:39:29,332 --> 00:39:33,079
You… you made me feel so safe.

460
00:39:37,107 --> 00:39:41,229
You told us that you could
protect us from everything.

461
00:39:49,397 --> 00:39:52,673
I'm gonna go out now and help the police,
just keep an eye on your mother.

462
00:39:53,832 --> 00:39:55,925
Your sister needs us
to be brave for her.

463
00:39:57,379 --> 00:40:00,266
Be brave for her, be a grown-up for me,
okay? Can you do that?

464
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,085
Can you do that?

465
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:05,164
I know you're scared. Look at me.

466
00:40:05,199 --> 00:40:07,817
Come here.
I know you're scared.

467
00:40:09,069 --> 00:40:10,225
It's gonna be okay.

468
00:40:27,459 --> 00:40:29,481
<i>The former is the reason why
we should be very patient,</i>

469
00:40:29,518 --> 00:40:33,698
<i>the latter why we should be very
penitent when we are afflicted.</i>

470
00:40:34,364 --> 00:40:37,155
<i>He reminds him that
trouble and affliction</i>

471
00:40:37,328 --> 00:40:40,389
<i>are what we have all reason
to expect in this world.</i>

472
00:40:41,063 --> 00:40:45,600
<i>Man is brought to trouble,
not as man but as sinful man,</i>

473
00:40:45,647 --> 00:40:47,287
 <i>who was in the transgression.</i>

474
00:40:47,344 --> 00:40:51,311
<i>Man is born in sin,
and therefore born to trouble.</i>

475
00:42:38,001 --> 00:42:41,451
Come on. Com'on, Tucker.

476
00:42:41,496 --> 00:42:46,906
Jingle bells, Batman
smells, Robin laid an egg!

477
00:42:47,382 --> 00:42:52,840
The Batmobile lost a wheel
and the Joker got away…

478
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:11,419
Alex.

479
00:43:18,672 --> 00:43:21,527
That song, where did you
hear those words? Hm?

480
00:43:46,886 --> 00:43:49,110
Did you bring a change
of clothes like I told you?

481
00:43:50,475 --> 00:43:54,130
Yeah. You gonna tell me why?

482
00:43:55,163 --> 00:43:57,390
It's better if I just show you.

483
00:43:59,942 --> 00:44:01,703
Show me what?

484
00:44:22,150 --> 00:44:24,712
— Didn't you use to live here?
— Mm-hmm.

485
00:44:37,476 --> 00:44:39,699
Close the door, lock it.

486
00:44:58,164 --> 00:44:59,100
Welcome home.

487
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:22,136
Oh, my God. What did you do?

488
00:45:22,693 --> 00:45:24,406
Keller, what in the hell—
— I heard him sing

489
00:45:24,436 --> 00:45:26,806
the same song they were
singing on Thanksgiving.

490
00:45:26,850 --> 00:45:28,560
I swear to God, Franklin,
the same fucking song.

491
00:45:28,609 --> 00:45:31,194
And I told you what he
said in the parking lot.

492
00:45:31,734 --> 00:45:34,803
— Then we take him to the police.
— No, no, no. Police won't do shit,

493
00:45:34,824 --> 00:45:36,975
he'll just clam up and
act crazy like he did last time.

494
00:45:37,019 --> 00:45:39,478
Someone has to make him talk. Someone!

495
00:45:45,830 --> 00:45:49,708
Shit, man, this— this ain't right!
What if you're wrong?

496
00:45:49,751 --> 00:45:52,193
— Come on, Franklin.
— No, no, wait! What if you're wrong?

497
00:45:52,262 --> 00:45:55,137
What if you only heard what you wanted
to hear? What if… what if…

498
00:45:55,528 --> 00:45:58,040
Man, I want my daughter back
as much as you do,

499
00:45:58,089 --> 00:46:00,327
— Franklin! Franklin!
— but this isn't right!

500
00:46:01,884 --> 00:46:04,994
We hurt him until he talks
or they're gonna die.

501
00:46:08,115 --> 00:46:10,936
— This ain't— This ain't—
— No! No!

502
00:46:11,968 --> 00:46:14,590
We hurt him until he talks
or they're gonna die.

503
00:46:14,625 --> 00:46:17,089
That's the choice.

504
00:46:19,092 --> 00:46:21,964
That's the choice you have to make.

505
00:46:21,999 --> 00:46:25,408
I've made my choice.
I know what I heard.

506
00:46:30,645 --> 00:46:32,985
He's not a person anymore.

507
00:46:33,579 --> 00:46:36,594
No, he stopped being a person
when he took our daughters.

508
00:46:47,012 --> 00:46:48,819
I need your help.

509
00:46:51,161 --> 00:46:54,073
This is your last chance.
I know you're scared,

510
00:46:54,108 --> 00:46:55,822
and I know you wanna go home.

511
00:46:55,848 --> 00:46:59,015
Alright, I don't… I don't
wanna hurt you, I don't.

512
00:46:59,050 --> 00:47:02,262
I'm gonna take the tape off, then
I want you to tell me where they are.

513
00:47:06,168 --> 00:47:06,480
Hey, come on.

514
00:47:11,923 --> 00:47:13,449
Did you see my glasses?

515
00:47:14,002 --> 00:47:16,041
— What?
— I can't see.

516
00:47:16,879 --> 00:47:19,479
If you aren't gonna talk, Alex,
I'm gonna have to hurt you.

517
00:47:21,206 --> 00:47:24,308
Tell me where they are?
Where are they?

518
00:47:26,574 --> 00:47:27,858
Tell me where they are!

519
00:47:28,768 --> 00:47:30,818
Yeah, I'm out here at the house
on Fairmont Circle,

520
00:47:30,866 --> 00:47:32,804
the house the RV
was parked in front of.

521
00:47:32,879 --> 00:47:34,754
It's only been on the market
a couple of months.

522
00:47:34,858 --> 00:47:37,098
I'm gonna track the owners down
and see if they know anything.

523
00:47:37,347 --> 00:47:40,601
You got any new info on that corpse
we found at the priest's basement?

524
00:47:40,683 --> 00:47:43,736
<i>No DNA, dental or fingerprint matches.</i>

525
00:47:43,985 --> 00:47:45,038
Nothing?

526
00:47:45,177 --> 00:47:47,753
<i>The priest is sticking
to the story too.</i>

527
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:51,079
Alright.

528
00:48:20,135 --> 00:48:24,169
Same person who took him
took those girls. I'm sure of it.

529
00:48:29,185 --> 00:48:31,294
I'm wearing out the tape I guess.

530
00:48:32,387 --> 00:48:36,535
I watch it everyday after breakfast,
it's the only video I have of him.

531
00:48:39,526 --> 00:48:41,476
It was before your time,

532
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:44,556
twenty-six years
ago, August 19th.

533
00:48:45,647 --> 00:48:48,083
I took a nap in the afternoon, and

534
00:48:48,142 --> 00:48:50,266
when I woke up, Barry was gone.

535
00:48:51,494 --> 00:48:54,072
No one could ever tell me
what happened to him.

536
00:48:55,906 --> 00:48:57,689
He was playing in the front yard, just

537
00:48:57,723 --> 00:49:00,619
a few feet from where
they say that RV was parked.

538
00:49:03,324 --> 00:49:05,394
What do you think that means?

539
00:49:09,764 --> 00:49:13,334
I'm more interested in
what you think that means.

540
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:17,541
I don't think we'll ever know.

541
00:49:18,069 --> 00:49:20,024
It's just like Barry.

542
00:49:21,501 --> 00:49:25,308
No one took them.
Nothing happened.

543
00:49:26,368 --> 00:49:28,568
They're just gone.

544
00:49:39,063 --> 00:49:41,125
How are you doin', Father?

545
00:49:44,753 --> 00:49:47,077
I've… been better.

546
00:49:47,733 --> 00:49:51,114
So Detective Chemelinksi tells me that
you have some specifics about the crime

547
00:49:51,409 --> 00:49:55,433
you claim that guy committed.
The abductor.

548
00:49:56,292 --> 00:50:02,400
He was… waging a war against God.

549
00:50:06,394 --> 00:50:08,997
Great. That's great.

550
00:50:10,147 --> 00:50:12,802
I thought you said he had
something specific? I… I…

551
00:50:12,837 --> 00:50:16,007
Tell him how he took the kids.

552
00:50:19,654 --> 00:50:22,014
He said…

553
00:50:23,672 --> 00:50:26,424
he took them in daylight.

554
00:50:27,047 --> 00:50:33,212
Sometimes more than
one child at a time.

555
00:50:34,150 --> 00:50:37,136
— He said that?
— Yes.

556
00:50:37,368 --> 00:50:41,474
Did he say if he was with anybody?
He did it alone?

557
00:50:45,463 --> 00:50:48,042
He… he said he had a family.

558
00:50:54,014 --> 00:50:56,129
— That's it?
— Yes.

559
00:51:00,711 --> 00:51:04,987
Alright.
Informative.

560
00:51:15,601 --> 00:51:17,892
You said they cried when you left them.

561
00:51:18,485 --> 00:51:21,771
Look at me, you said they cried
when you left them!

562
00:51:21,806 --> 00:51:24,617
You said they cried when you left them!

563
00:51:25,502 --> 00:51:29,135
Tell me! Where is she?

564
00:51:32,061 --> 00:51:33,982
Tell me where they are!

565
00:51:39,369 --> 00:51:42,170
Just tell me. Just tell me and I'll stop.

566
00:51:42,209 --> 00:51:44,702
I'll stop as soon as you tell me.

567
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:54,075
Just… Just tell me where they are.

568
00:52:02,725 --> 00:52:05,079
Why won't you tell me?
Uh?

569
00:52:10,589 --> 00:52:13,673
Why won't you just fucking tell us?

570
00:52:27,301 --> 00:52:30,607
He knows.
He knows.

571
00:52:33,019 --> 00:52:35,661
I can see in his eyes.
He fucking knows.

572
00:52:36,939 --> 00:52:41,254
I know you know, why
aren't you fucking telling me?

573
00:52:43,736 --> 00:52:45,541
Why?

574
00:52:54,889 --> 00:52:57,113
Come on. Get him up.

575
00:52:58,174 --> 00:53:01,659
Up. Get up.
Get up!

576
00:53:08,252 --> 00:53:11,222
You're gonna make me use this?

577
00:53:11,257 --> 00:53:15,378
You're gonna tell us, if you don't I'm gonna use this.

578
00:53:22,314 --> 00:53:24,314
You're doing this to yourself.

579
00:53:24,349 --> 00:53:27,937
Just tell us.
Tell me…

580
00:53:29,318 --> 00:53:31,000
Tell me!

581
00:53:33,755 --> 00:53:37,768
Tell me! Tell me! Tell me!

582
00:53:39,193 --> 00:53:43,450
Where is my daughter?
Where's — my — daughter?

583
00:54:06,551 --> 00:54:11,909
<i>Four days have passed since Anna Dover and
Joy Birch were last seen by their families… </i>

584
00:54:38,347 --> 00:54:40,197
Where have you been?

585
00:54:40,232 --> 00:54:43,801
I was searching for her in the woods.

586
00:55:06,683 --> 00:55:07,993
Franklin, what is it?

587
00:58:33,195 --> 00:58:35,310
Huh! Hey, what the fuck!

588
00:59:20,573 --> 00:59:23,160
<i>And this is who the police are saying
is a person of interest,</i>

589
00:59:23,321 --> 00:59:25,851
<i>in the investigation of
the two missing girls.</i>

590
00:59:25,886 --> 00:59:30,196
<i>Now this unidentified man who was
last seen at last night's candlelight vigil,</i>

591
00:59:30,231 --> 00:59:34,593
<i>fled on foot when the investigating
detective attempted to question him.</i>

592
00:59:34,756 --> 00:59:37,492
<i>The police caution the public
not to approach this man</i>

593
00:59:37,527 --> 00:59:40,620
<i>but to call the police immediately
if they do see him.</i>

594
00:59:56,638 --> 00:59:57,858
Look, Keller.

595
00:59:58,798 --> 01:00:01,859
Let me just think about it, why would
the police be looking for this man,

596
01:00:01,877 --> 01:00:03,837
if they didn't think
he did it in the first place?

597
01:00:03,917 --> 01:00:06,366
They did it together,
they know each other.

598
01:00:06,401 --> 01:00:08,073
I fucking told you. Right?

599
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:11,818
He just looked me in the eyes,
he said they only cried when I left them.

600
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:14,803
Somebody who knows where the guy is.

601
01:00:20,355 --> 01:00:23,796
Alex Jones' dog.
Got it on Southern street.

602
01:00:23,943 --> 01:00:25,972
Apparently Alex Jones
took the dog for a walk,

603
01:00:26,047 --> 01:00:27,055
the night before last,
he never came home.

604
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:28,932
and his aunt didn't want
to tell us about the dog

605
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:30,278
when we called about it
this morning, she said

606
01:00:30,329 --> 01:00:32,945
that she thought we'd get him
into trouble or some shit.

607
01:00:32,987 --> 01:00:34,764
I thought you said we would
keep him under surveillance.

608
01:00:34,847 --> 01:00:36,360
And I thought you said
the guy was innocent.

609
01:00:36,499 --> 01:00:39,405
And I thought the guy
from last night you said was our guy.

610
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:42,171
Look, I don't have money in the budget
for watching innocent people.

611
01:00:42,206 --> 01:00:44,055
You said to me that you'd
put him under surveillance.

612
01:00:44,081 --> 01:00:45,865
— What d'you want me to say?
— Did you keep your word?

613
01:00:45,971 --> 01:00:47,837
You could have just given me a call,
cause I would have been there all night,

614
01:00:47,863 --> 01:00:50,091
I would have stayed up all night,
I would know where he was now.

615
01:00:50,133 --> 01:00:51,289
I need to know where everybody is.

616
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:53,363
Alright, point made.
Alright? Point made.

617
01:00:53,390 --> 01:00:55,411
You'll be clear with me,
and I'll be clear with you.

618
01:00:55,492 --> 01:00:56,974
I need to know where everybody is.

619
01:00:57,017 --> 01:00:59,124
You can something different,
please tell me.

620
01:01:02,424 --> 01:01:03,969
<i>Tell me about the RV.</i>

621
01:01:04,125 --> 01:01:05,778
<i>What were you doing in the RV?</i>

622
01:01:06,495 --> 01:01:10,358
<i>It's where I go…
to be alone.</i>

623
01:01:15,912 --> 01:01:18,735
<i>What music do you listen to
in the RV when you're alone?</i>

624
01:01:21,050 --> 01:01:23,629
<i>Radio… Tape… </i>

625
01:01:28,336 --> 01:01:31,510
The RV was parked over
on Fairmont for a reason?

626
01:01:31,545 --> 01:01:36,636
No. Just I am coming. I am— I— I—

627
01:01:41,350 --> 01:01:45,169
— Have you seen these girls?
— No.

628
01:01:45,204 --> 01:01:47,799
Just take a look at them.
Have you seen these girls?

629
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:52,186
No.

630
01:01:52,221 --> 01:01:55,456
Did you participate in any way
in the abduction of these girls?

631
01:01:57,084 --> 01:01:58,805
No.

632
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:00,861
Loki, you got a call.

633
01:02:08,201 --> 01:02:10,316
I called as soon as I saw the sketch on TV.

634
01:02:10,763 --> 01:02:13,580
He comes in here every week almost
to buy some kids clothes, but

635
01:02:13,759 --> 01:02:16,043
he's always buying stuff
in different sizes,

636
01:02:16,078 --> 01:02:18,830
I caught him messing around
with the mannequins once.

637
01:02:19,381 --> 01:02:21,586
— What'd he pay with?
— Cash.

638
01:02:23,850 --> 01:02:26,099
Uh, you give me a call
if you hear anything.

639
01:02:26,333 --> 01:02:27,717
Okay.

640
01:02:32,473 --> 01:02:34,582
It's been five days.

641
01:02:34,742 --> 01:02:37,960
Five days since he had a drink of water.

642
01:02:38,856 --> 01:02:41,409
And this could be
your last night that matters.

643
01:02:44,357 --> 01:02:47,493
Look, I call you after
Nancy goes to sleep, alright?

644
01:02:49,609 --> 01:02:51,673
I promise.

645
01:03:22,783 --> 01:03:24,703
Where have you been all this time?

646
01:03:56,568 --> 01:03:58,443
What the hell were you thinking?

647
01:04:09,075 --> 01:04:10,557
Did you tell anyone?

648
01:04:11,482 --> 01:04:13,392
Did you?

649
01:04:18,291 --> 01:04:19,900
I want to see him.

650
01:05:24,908 --> 01:05:27,112
Please help me.

651
01:05:30,236 --> 01:05:33,294
Can you help me find my little girl.

652
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:38,971
I got a picture.
Here.

653
01:05:41,399 --> 01:05:43,920
This is my baby.

654
01:05:47,289 --> 01:05:49,576
Her name is Joy.

655
01:05:58,844 --> 01:06:01,882
This is… it's a teddy we got her
when she was two

656
01:06:01,909 --> 01:06:04,215
because she was afraid
to sleep by herself,

657
01:06:04,234 --> 01:06:08,194
please tell me where my little girl is,
please tell me where my girl…

658
01:06:16,936 --> 01:06:22,114
Oh, I know you're gonna tell me.
I know you're gonna tell me.

659
01:06:41,110 --> 01:06:42,720
Help me.

660
01:06:46,004 --> 01:06:47,675
Please, help me.

661
01:06:51,003 --> 01:06:52,635
Nancy!

662
01:06:54,831 --> 01:06:56,219
What the fuck are you doing?

663
01:06:59,842 --> 01:07:01,361
Let it down!

664
01:07:02,740 --> 01:07:05,518
Let it go.
Let it go!

665
01:07:10,107 --> 01:07:13,060
You untied him? Huh?

666
01:07:24,668 --> 01:07:27,398
That was close.

667
01:08:09,026 --> 01:08:10,150
What is it, what happened?

668
01:08:10,198 --> 01:08:12,233
Get Franklin.
I need to show you something.

669
01:08:16,686 --> 01:08:18,321
Did he say anything new?

670
01:08:18,356 --> 01:08:20,422
He will soon, you'll see.

671
01:08:30,467 --> 01:08:32,512
No light gets in.

672
01:08:33,916 --> 01:08:36,399
Barely enough room to sit down inside.

673
01:08:37,384 --> 01:08:40,249
The shower still works,
but we control it from that here.

674
01:08:41,398 --> 01:08:45,645
And with the water heater, so
it either comes out scalding or freezing.

675
01:08:48,349 --> 01:08:51,167
And uh… we talk to him through this.

676
01:08:51,852 --> 01:08:56,704
It's to remind us
if we start feeling sorry for him.

677
01:08:58,008 --> 01:08:59,707
My God.

678
01:08:59,742 --> 01:09:02,177
We can't hurt him anymore
without killing him, so

679
01:09:02,212 --> 01:09:03,836
this is the only way.

680
01:09:04,609 --> 01:09:06,591
Have you lost your mind, Keller?

681
01:09:07,663 --> 01:09:10,700
Do you have a better idea, Franklin?

682
01:09:10,813 --> 01:09:11,906
Untie him.

683
01:09:14,355 --> 01:09:16,737
Go ahead, let him out of here,
I'm not gonna stop you.

684
01:09:17,606 --> 01:09:19,964
If that's what you really want,
you go ahead.

685
01:09:21,289 --> 01:09:23,066
You think soon is long
enough for the girls,

686
01:09:23,092 --> 01:09:24,552
the way you're looking out for him?

687
01:09:25,770 --> 01:09:27,973
I hope.

688
01:09:29,687 --> 01:09:32,664
It's been five days now,
and we're really running out of time.

689
01:09:34,535 --> 01:09:35,945
You don't even know it's him.

690
01:09:36,009 --> 01:09:37,279
— I do.
— No, you don't.

691
01:09:37,315 --> 01:09:39,352
— I do.
— I know you, you don't.

692
01:09:42,405 --> 01:09:46,099
Look,I want my baby back…

693
01:09:46,831 --> 01:09:49,293
as much as you

694
01:09:50,065 --> 01:09:52,732
and despite what you think about me,

695
01:09:53,042 --> 01:09:55,534
I would die for my daughter.

696
01:09:56,266 --> 01:09:58,579
But this ain't right.

697
01:09:58,780 --> 01:10:00,472
This has to stop.

698
01:10:02,794 --> 01:10:05,569
Alright, you'd better get to work.

699
01:10:06,872 --> 01:10:10,607
Let's start with that wall there.

700
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:33,745
Stop.

701
01:10:41,654 --> 01:10:43,588
Think of July.

702
01:11:23,876 --> 01:11:26,214
I need to get out of this place, Ralph.

703
01:11:26,831 --> 01:11:30,688
Everything in this house just
makes me want to throw up.

704
01:11:33,716 --> 01:11:35,040
Your Dad's building.

705
01:11:36,025 --> 01:11:38,649
No, there is no way I'm standing
in that crack house.

706
01:12:09,247 --> 01:12:12,221
It's not gonna help Keller,
but we won't stop him.

707
01:12:12,366 --> 01:12:14,804
Let him do what he needs to.

708
01:12:21,277 --> 01:12:22,994
We don't know about it anymore.

709
01:12:48,772 --> 01:12:50,889
Lisa…

710
01:12:51,635 --> 01:12:52,841
Elisa.

711
01:13:03,620 --> 01:13:05,710
Elisa, open the door.

712
01:13:06,884 --> 01:13:08,416
Elisa!

713
01:13:09,625 --> 01:13:10,805
Honey?

714
01:13:11,368 --> 01:13:13,002
Right, I'll break it, I'll—

715
01:13:13,037 --> 01:13:15,340
Yeah, fuck you both.

716
01:13:15,375 --> 01:13:17,293
Yeah, somebody explain me
on leaving me here alone

717
01:13:17,332 --> 01:13:19,412
when you could try at least
tell me where you're going.

718
01:14:58,819 --> 01:15:00,511
Mom?

719
01:15:04,809 --> 01:15:06,346
Mom?
— Anna.

720
01:15:06,410 --> 01:15:09,072
Anna was here.
— Mom, hey Mom!

721
01:15:09,140 --> 01:15:12,091
Mom, come on, sit down. Calm down.
I will close the window.

722
01:15:16,416 --> 01:15:19,284
I am sure I was here.

723
01:15:19,502 --> 01:15:22,913
And then I heard…
a sound from my room, and I…

724
01:15:22,948 --> 01:15:26,823
I came in, and the window was open.
And…

725
01:15:26,858 --> 01:15:29,872
and it wasn't open before.

726
01:15:29,907 --> 01:15:34,380
And then… and then Ralph, he…
he came in.

727
01:15:34,675 --> 01:15:37,254
And he looked, and uh…

728
01:15:38,742 --> 01:15:42,292
And then…
Then, I don't know.

729
01:15:44,814 --> 01:15:46,904
Won't you gonna write this down?

730
01:15:59,830 --> 01:16:03,042
The basement, I didn't check the basement,
we need to check the basement.

731
01:16:03,681 --> 01:16:05,595
Right, I'll show you.
I'll show you.

732
01:16:17,802 --> 01:16:20,114
Kids know they're not
allowed to come here.

733
01:16:26,057 --> 01:16:29,321
They're not supposed to come down here,
but then, you never know.

734
01:16:46,111 --> 01:16:48,842
My husband likes to be
prepared for emergency.

735
01:16:55,564 --> 01:16:57,764
Where is your husband, Mrs. Dover?

736
01:16:59,053 --> 01:17:00,622
I was gonna ask you,

737
01:17:00,654 --> 01:17:02,963
he's been out searching
with the police for Anna.

738
01:17:03,374 --> 01:17:05,773
But you shouldn't be here right now.

739
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:08,807
Does he always stay out this late?

740
01:17:09,667 --> 01:17:13,151
Yes he stays out this late.
When he is looking for my daughter,

741
01:17:13,217 --> 01:17:15,368
and my daughter would be gone, yes!

742
01:17:16,174 --> 01:17:17,730
Shit.

743
01:18:42,967 --> 01:18:45,150
Hey. Pull around.

744
01:18:45,185 --> 01:18:47,096
Pull around.

745
01:19:43,899 --> 01:19:46,231
Come on, Mr. Dover.

746
01:20:08,385 --> 01:20:10,324
Why are you following me?

747
01:20:11,687 --> 01:20:13,940
Get in the car.

748
01:20:26,588 --> 01:20:28,479
Why are you following me?

749
01:20:32,031 --> 01:20:34,080
Where were you going just now?

750
01:20:35,087 --> 01:20:37,904
I parked at a liquor store,
I have a bottle of liquor.

751
01:20:38,344 --> 01:20:41,403
You're the shit hot detective,
work it out.

752
01:20:42,555 --> 01:20:44,891
Actually, before that…

753
01:20:45,508 --> 01:20:48,037
You were walking
in the opposite direction.

754
01:20:48,388 --> 01:20:52,772
Across the parking lot.
Towards Campello street.

755
01:21:00,524 --> 01:21:04,514
It's been long. I hadn't been drinking
in nine and a half years.

756
01:21:05,318 --> 01:21:07,871
I fear if I walked
in the parking lot for a while,

757
01:21:07,906 --> 01:21:10,212
by the time they open,
I'd still want in that bad.

758
01:21:10,987 --> 01:21:13,548
and then, uh, then I saw you.

759
01:21:13,644 --> 01:21:15,850
So it helped me make up my mind.

760
01:21:21,818 --> 01:21:24,705
There's a bag of lye in your basement.
It's half-empty.

761
01:21:27,966 --> 01:21:30,971
Your wife thinks you've been
helping us with…

762
01:21:33,193 --> 01:21:35,814
 but we both know that's not true.

763
01:21:37,843 --> 01:21:40,435
I used the lye to bury our dog last year.

764
01:21:40,517 --> 01:21:43,713
And "helping a cop" sounds better than
"I've been driving aimlessly in my truck

765
01:21:43,763 --> 01:21:45,729
cause I don't know
what the fuck else to do."

766
01:21:46,216 --> 01:21:48,696
Is that what you were doing
last Saturday night?

767
01:21:49,566 --> 01:21:51,356
Probably. Am I a suspect?

768
01:21:51,449 --> 01:21:52,891
No, I'm only asking.

769
01:21:52,966 --> 01:21:55,843
I'm only asking cause you
assaulted the man who's gone missing.

770
01:21:57,700 --> 01:21:59,857
I heard that. Then what happened?

771
01:21:59,905 --> 01:22:01,444
I thought you had him under surveillance.

772
01:22:01,490 --> 01:22:03,728
I'm— I'm gonna assume you're asking
because you have no idea.

773
01:22:03,867 --> 01:22:05,930
Yeah, I didn't think it was something
I could get away with.

774
01:22:06,870 --> 01:22:08,449
It's not.

775
01:22:08,562 --> 01:22:11,281
Yeah, how convenient. They skip town,
cause this asshole is guilty.

776
01:22:11,433 --> 01:22:12,596
Oh, it could be that, right?

777
01:22:12,622 --> 01:22:14,418
'Cause then it wouldn't
be your fault, right?

778
01:22:16,210 --> 01:22:17,797
Mr. Dover.

779
01:22:20,664 --> 01:22:22,671
Mr. Dover.
— What?

780
01:22:22,706 --> 01:22:24,862
You take care of yourself and your wife.

781
01:22:24,888 --> 01:22:27,359
That's the best thing
you can do right now.

782
01:22:29,242 --> 01:22:32,680
 That little girl is gonna need you
when she comes home.

783
01:22:36,060 --> 01:22:38,130
Kids gone for more than a week…

784
01:22:38,473 --> 01:22:40,439
have half as good a chance of being found,

785
01:22:40,488 --> 01:22:43,191
and after a month, almost none
are found alive, alright?

786
01:22:43,646 --> 01:22:46,461
So, forgive me for doing
everything I can to f…

787
01:22:46,695 --> 01:22:48,675
You know what?
It hasn't been a fucking week.

788
01:22:48,693 --> 01:22:49,822
— You're right.
— It hasn't been a week.

789
01:22:49,839 --> 01:22:51,762
Day fucking six! Day six.

790
01:22:52,007 --> 01:22:56,442
And every day, she's wondering
why I'm not there to fucking rescue her!

791
01:22:56,827 --> 01:22:59,332
 Do you understand that? Me, not you!

792
01:22:59,375 --> 01:23:02,940
 Not you! But ME! EVERY DAY!

793
01:23:03,753 --> 01:23:08,536
So forgive me for not going home
to have a good night's rest!

794
01:23:09,249 --> 01:23:12,437
And why didn't you look
for my fucking daughter?

795
01:23:12,528 --> 01:23:15,414
Mother fucking—
— Hey, hey, hey, hey…

796
01:23:16,366 --> 01:23:18,459
— Don't follow me.
— Hey, hey, hey, hey…

797
01:23:18,557 --> 01:23:21,152
Mr. Dover, Mr. Dover…

798
01:23:27,465 --> 01:23:29,258
Now you think I'm gonna let
you get behind the wheel

799
01:23:29,284 --> 01:23:30,486
 after you've been
drinking, do you?

800
01:23:30,528 --> 01:23:33,433
I'm gonna walk.
You look for my daughter.

801
01:24:20,727 --> 01:24:22,488
Daddy.

802
01:24:23,539 --> 01:24:25,745
Daddy, help me.

803
01:24:29,632 --> 01:24:30,885
Who was it?

804
01:26:27,608 --> 01:26:28,400
[ ]

805
01:26:30,811 --> 01:26:33,609
Wait. What'd you say.
What? What?

806
01:26:38,442 --> 01:26:41,289
[ ]

807
01:26:42,563 --> 01:26:45,187
Listen. You don't understand.

808
01:26:45,796 --> 01:26:49,254
Just— just help you.
— Help me.

809
01:26:51,629 --> 01:26:54,588
No no no. No more riddles.
Just fucking tell me.

810
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:02,282
I'll let you go home tonight…
if you tell me where they are.

811
01:27:04,730 --> 01:27:08,354
I just want… to play…

812
01:27:08,585 --> 01:27:10,908
Don't let me do this again.

813
01:27:11,194 --> 01:27:13,306
Don't let me do it.

814
01:27:18,677 --> 01:27:21,298
Why are you making me do this?

815
01:27:39,224 --> 01:27:41,741
Oh God…

816
01:27:44,856 --> 01:27:49,202
[prays]

817
01:27:50,558 --> 01:27:53,671
And I hope you'll forgive me for my sins.

818
01:28:25,316 --> 01:28:27,191
Damn it.

819
01:28:33,017 --> 01:28:34,761
No— no noise, you shut up.

820
01:28:34,857 --> 01:28:37,661
You make any noise,
and I turn on that tap.

821
01:29:27,007 --> 01:29:28,931
High, rising shine.

822
01:29:34,151 --> 01:29:36,176
I ain't gonna find girls here, am I?

823
01:29:36,513 --> 01:29:38,533
Fuck you.

824
01:29:44,904 --> 01:29:48,124
— What about Alex Jones?
— What about him?

825
01:29:49,952 --> 01:29:53,305
I came to drink here, I didn't wanna
drink in front of my wife.

826
01:29:54,804 --> 01:29:57,758
Look, my father left me
this building, alright?

827
01:30:01,218 --> 01:30:03,334
You're not giving me a tour?

828
01:30:15,065 --> 01:30:17,090
Why didn't you tell me about this place?

829
01:30:17,125 --> 01:30:20,714
— I didn't think it mattered.
— Everything matters.

830
01:30:25,851 --> 01:30:28,657
It's all pretty much like this.
I will renovate soon.

831
01:30:29,200 --> 01:30:32,769
Yeah.
Not as organized as your basement, uh?

832
01:30:37,063 --> 01:30:39,623
What's up with all this
survival gear in there?

833
01:30:40,593 --> 01:30:42,887
Pray for the best,
prepare for the worst.

834
01:30:43,528 --> 01:30:45,905
Yes, we agree there, yeah?

835
01:30:47,534 --> 01:30:48,914
Come on, hurry up.

836
01:31:22,900 --> 01:31:24,440
Ah shit!

837
01:31:28,121 --> 01:31:29,573
Hello?

838
01:31:32,881 --> 01:31:34,928
The guy that you were
looking for was just here.

839
01:31:34,963 --> 01:31:37,028
He saw me watching and then ran.

840
01:31:37,063 --> 01:31:38,626
Did you get a plate?

841
01:31:43,542 --> 01:31:45,056
Yeah…

842
01:31:47,205 --> 01:31:49,119
Yeah.

843
01:31:52,250 --> 01:31:53,460
Yeah.

844
01:31:54,885 --> 01:31:57,987
Go home, Mr. Dover.

845
01:32:27,225 --> 01:32:28,969
'Morning.

846
01:32:38,818 --> 01:32:41,836
Why did you run away
from me the other night, then?

847
01:32:43,279 --> 01:32:45,769
I've never seen you before.

848
01:32:46,576 --> 01:32:48,675
You sure you're at the right house?

849
01:32:49,437 --> 01:32:52,086
You're doing some shopping
in the ValueMore lately?

850
01:32:53,500 --> 01:32:57,950
Yeah. Hm-hmm…
Why? Is it a crime to shop there?

851
01:32:57,994 --> 01:33:01,004
I can't afford to buy suits
from Brooks brothers.

852
01:33:06,302 --> 01:33:10,782
Uh yeah, no…
Ah right, you buy children's cloth.

853
01:33:12,007 --> 01:33:15,647
Did I? Must have been in a hurry.

854
01:33:21,297 --> 01:33:23,940
Do you have— do you have children?

855
01:33:27,262 --> 01:33:30,416
I don't… have…

856
01:33:55,329 --> 01:33:57,686
You move, I put a bullet
into your fucking head.

857
01:34:16,387 --> 01:34:19,948
This is 13-40, I need additional units
for search. 4-2-7 Keller street.

858
01:34:20,040 --> 01:34:23,655
Possible kidnapping victims
on the premises.

859
01:35:12,523 --> 01:35:14,116
Anna. Fucking…

860
01:35:15,240 --> 01:35:17,394
Anna? Joy?

861
01:35:17,749 --> 01:35:19,511
Fuck.

862
01:36:12,566 --> 01:36:15,191
Aah. Fuck.

863
01:37:12,913 --> 01:37:17,048
So we've taken photographs
of the clothes found…

864
01:38:06,341 --> 01:38:08,609
Mr. Dover, is your wife here?

865
01:38:15,426 --> 01:38:17,852
She's not coming.

866
01:38:19,015 --> 01:38:21,299
So if you can make it,
I made these photographs,

867
01:38:21,315 --> 01:38:23,707
I'm gonna need her to come
in and take a look at them.

868
01:38:31,066 --> 01:38:32,715
Have a seat.

869
01:38:43,679 --> 01:38:45,878
So he confessed and he said he killed them.

870
01:38:47,734 --> 01:38:50,136
We're hoping he was lying, but…

871
01:38:50,495 --> 01:38:53,819
we haven't found any bodies,
Mr. Dover, but…

872
01:38:57,505 --> 01:39:01,366
The butcher's partly identified
two pieces of cloth.

873
01:39:02,657 --> 01:39:06,580
So I'm gonna need to— you tell me
if you recognize anything.

874
01:39:28,402 --> 01:39:30,030
No.

875
01:39:40,782 --> 01:39:43,956
Not sure. I don't know.

876
01:39:49,620 --> 01:39:51,053
No.

877
01:40:27,524 --> 01:40:29,460
That's her sock.

878
01:40:49,583 --> 01:40:51,750
You wasted time.

879
01:40:57,501 --> 01:40:59,972
You wasted time following me.

880
01:41:09,821 --> 01:41:12,868
You let this happen.

881
01:41:51,209 --> 01:41:53,060
Don't talk to them.

882
01:42:00,226 --> 01:42:02,370
Elisa told me they're dead.

883
01:42:04,986 --> 01:42:07,256
— Is it true?
— No.

884
01:42:07,291 --> 01:42:09,979
No, she said they found
their body cloth.

885
01:42:10,062 --> 01:42:11,637
Don't tell your mother that,
don't you dare

886
01:42:11,663 --> 01:42:13,202
tell your mother that,
d'you understand me?

887
01:42:14,675 --> 01:42:16,619
Now I need you to listen to me.

888
01:42:16,676 --> 01:42:18,602
I need you to stay with her
in the house a couple of days,

889
01:42:18,622 --> 01:42:20,436
and you make sure
she does not watch the news,

890
01:42:20,462 --> 01:42:22,239
and when the people come,
you just go the fuck away.

891
01:42:22,265 --> 01:42:25,874
Listen!
Do not give up on your sister, do not!

892
01:42:27,721 --> 01:42:30,401
I will find her, and I'll bring her home,
I'm not giving up.

893
01:42:30,435 --> 01:42:33,512
You're gonna bring her home?
She's dead, you can't do anything.

894
01:42:33,804 --> 01:42:35,104
You've been leaving me and mum here,

895
01:42:35,130 --> 01:42:36,816
while you— you were going out
to get fucking drunk,

896
01:42:36,871 --> 01:42:40,777
look, I— I can smell it on you!
— Shut up!

897
01:43:02,970 --> 01:43:06,189
How long has this Bob Taylor
been working on this map?

898
01:43:07,126 --> 01:43:09,262
Three and a half hours.

899
01:43:09,967 --> 01:43:12,631
And you think this gonna leave you to the
bodies? Cause that sure as shit don't.

900
01:43:12,657 --> 01:43:14,631
Yeah, give me a favor, cap,
and go fuck yourself.

901
01:43:15,549 --> 01:43:17,862
We weren't getting anywhere
questioning him.

902
01:43:22,289 --> 01:43:26,545
— It looks more like a maze than a map.
— He's got a thing for mazes.

903
01:43:28,972 --> 01:43:32,759
I'm going home.
Call me if something happens.

904
01:44:16,658 --> 01:44:19,390
Give me that card, Joe. The key card.

905
01:44:28,914 --> 01:44:30,865
Alright, it's done now.

906
01:44:32,740 --> 01:44:34,812
Tell me what you're drawing.

907
01:44:36,174 --> 01:44:37,918
You said you were drawing a map,

908
01:44:37,970 --> 01:44:40,412
it looks like a fucking puzzle,
tell me what you're drawing.

909
01:44:45,868 --> 01:44:48,913
— Tell me what you're drawing.
— I can't…

910
01:44:50,849 --> 01:44:53,758
Yes you can. Yes you can.

911
01:44:54,681 --> 01:44:55,910
Shit!

912
01:44:55,956 --> 01:44:57,793
Yes, you can!
Yes you can!

913
01:44:59,022 --> 01:45:01,871
Yes you can! Yes you can!

914
01:45:03,163 --> 01:45:04,899
Oh, shit!
Gun! Gun!

915
01:45:05,416 --> 01:45:08,547
Come on, don't!
Put ​​the gun down!

916
01:45:09,494 --> 01:45:11,521
Put the gun down!

917
01:45:11,596 --> 01:45:14,038
No, no, no!
No, no, no!

918
01:45:16,454 --> 01:45:18,701
Fuck…

919
01:45:20,690 --> 01:45:23,244
You gonna call a fuckin' RE!

920
01:45:33,812 --> 01:45:42,692
[Pray]

921
01:46:16,106 --> 01:46:18,951
He explained this before
he hit the bullet?

922
01:46:24,501 --> 01:46:26,238
I'm sorry.

923
01:46:26,817 --> 01:46:29,946
Fuck yourself.
Save it for the girls parents.

924
01:46:34,774 --> 01:46:36,712
I don't know what to do, Alex.

925
01:46:37,515 --> 01:46:39,589
I don't know what to do anymore.

926
01:46:40,298 --> 01:46:44,068
And what comes pretty fucked-up about all
this is I know you know where they are.

927
01:46:47,815 --> 01:46:50,640
I think we're done.

928
01:46:57,181 --> 01:46:59,027
In the maze…

929
01:47:01,227 --> 01:47:02,829
That's where they put them.

930
01:47:02,883 --> 01:47:05,728
What? What did you say?

931
01:47:09,842 --> 01:47:13,193
It's the maze.

932
01:47:13,228 --> 01:47:16,949
What— what maze, where is it?
Where is the maze? Where do I find it?

933
01:47:17,805 --> 01:47:18,900
Alex?

934
01:47:19,866 --> 01:47:21,435
Alex, Alex, listen to me.

935
01:47:21,649 --> 01:47:24,964
I'm gonna get you outta here,
okay, tell me just where the maze is.

936
01:47:25,577 --> 01:47:27,618
That's it, just tell me, mate.

937
01:47:28,891 --> 01:47:30,730
Where is the maze?

938
01:47:32,201 --> 01:47:36,101
Come on, tell me.
Just tell me where the maze is, okay?

939
01:47:39,375 --> 01:47:40,916
Come on, don't fuck with me.

940
01:47:40,934 --> 01:47:43,330
Don't fuck with me now,
tell me goddammit!

941
01:47:43,373 --> 01:47:45,275
Tell me where they are.

942
01:47:45,804 --> 01:47:48,731
Tell me, tell me! Tell me!

943
01:47:52,326 --> 01:47:54,260
Something's gonna get to you man.

944
01:47:54,324 --> 01:47:57,236
Something's gonna get to you!
Something's gonna get to you!

945
01:48:24,975 --> 01:48:26,730
Can I help you?

946
01:48:26,765 --> 01:48:30,464
Good morning, Ma'm, uh…
I'm Keller Dover,

947
01:48:30,499 --> 01:48:35,235
my little girl was…
abducted with her friend.

948
01:48:37,237 --> 01:48:39,284
What do you want?

949
01:48:44,738 --> 01:48:47,521
I guess I haven't though this
too well, uhm I…

950
01:48:49,306 --> 01:48:52,552
I've been thinking a lot about
what happened to your nephew,

951
01:48:53,527 --> 01:48:56,813
and I know I scared him
the other day at the police station, and…

952
01:48:58,679 --> 01:49:03,113
What I'm trying to say is I kind of
feel responsible for him running away.

953
01:49:05,350 --> 01:49:09,273
— You wanna come on in?
— Yeah…

954
01:49:19,253 --> 01:49:23,756
My husband and I were…
very devoted one time.

955
01:49:25,770 --> 01:49:29,805
We spent our summers driving around
with that camper with our son.

956
01:49:31,357 --> 01:49:36,577
Handing out pamphlets…
Spreading out God word.

957
01:49:40,008 --> 01:49:45,799
After our son died of cancer…
we started seeing things differently.

958
01:49:47,873 --> 01:49:52,093
Adopting Alex helped.
Howie never got up here.

959
01:49:54,051 --> 01:49:55,543
I'm sorry.

960
01:49:58,402 --> 01:50:00,424
You look very tired.

961
01:50:02,815 --> 01:50:04,793
Yeah, I don't sleep much.

962
01:50:05,823 --> 01:50:07,913
I, uh…

963
01:50:09,478 --> 01:50:12,696
I keep dreaming
I've being lost in a maze.

964
01:50:15,887 --> 01:50:17,553
I'm sorry.

965
01:50:18,039 --> 01:50:23,029
Alex never talks very much, so
people come over here,

966
01:50:23,062 --> 01:50:25,647
I hardly know what to say.
— He doesn't talk much?

967
01:50:25,698 --> 01:50:28,640
Oh he talks, you know,
'good morning' and that sort of things.

968
01:50:29,095 --> 01:50:31,799
Hard to get too much more than that.

969
01:50:33,627 --> 01:50:35,656
He had an accident when he was little.

970
01:50:35,673 --> 01:50:39,591
And after that he started
choosing his words about too carefully.

971
01:50:40,543 --> 01:50:42,879
What, uh— what kind of accident?

972
01:50:44,235 --> 01:50:45,955
My husband kept snakes.

973
01:50:46,377 --> 01:50:48,732
No, it wasn't that bad,
what happened, but…

974
01:50:48,802 --> 01:50:51,505
now with that fear of them…

975
01:50:52,146 --> 01:50:54,745
That's not my favorite memory.

976
01:50:54,994 --> 01:50:57,963
Yeah, I'm sorry,
it's none of my business.

977
01:51:03,460 --> 01:51:05,794
Can I get you a cup of tea, Mr. Dover?

978
01:51:13,107 --> 01:51:15,926
Oh I'm so sorry, I— I thought
you had known about that already.

979
01:51:17,326 --> 01:51:19,696
I say it's better this way,
you know, that awful man,

980
01:51:19,734 --> 01:51:24,828
he would have spent years on death row,
just watching TV and getting fat.

981
01:51:31,035 --> 01:51:33,504
You still have to worry
about losing your PSP.

982
01:51:41,062 --> 01:51:43,020
When forensics have finished
with the guy's place,

983
01:51:43,067 --> 01:51:45,305
we're gonna deploy cadaver dogs.

984
01:51:46,672 --> 01:51:49,079
Look kid, we can't always save the day.

985
01:51:50,118 --> 01:51:54,136
Alright? We're just cops. Janitors.

986
01:51:55,098 --> 01:51:56,953
So we lost this one. alright?

987
01:51:57,486 --> 01:52:00,263
Look, you want a family,
you need to find a girl,

988
01:52:00,307 --> 01:52:04,194
you know, start a family,
have some kids, let it go.

989
01:53:34,630 --> 01:53:35,929
— Yeah?
— <i>Hey, it's Rich.</i>

990
01:53:35,964 --> 01:53:38,313
<i>We found something.</i>

991
01:53:41,776 --> 01:53:43,431
Guys, let's have a look.

992
01:53:47,996 --> 01:53:51,544
Two kid size department store mannequins,
with their heads kicked in.

993
01:53:52,212 --> 01:53:54,625
I was talking to our lab guys,
and they told me that all the blood

994
01:53:54,654 --> 01:53:57,357
that we sampled from the plastic
containers… pig's blood.

995
01:53:58,514 --> 01:54:00,757
Alright you guys, let's get this
covered up, it's supposed to snow soon.

996
01:54:00,783 --> 01:54:02,783
Hurry up, okay?

997
01:54:05,367 --> 01:54:06,706
It's like he's play acting.

998
01:54:06,727 --> 01:54:10,621
I mean, except for the few items
ID'd by the Dovers and the purchases,

999
01:54:10,651 --> 01:54:13,553
all the kids cloth that we found
still had the tags on.

1000
01:54:13,925 --> 01:54:16,724
And that maze book that we found,
made.

1001
01:54:16,753 --> 01:54:19,417
Photocopies, pictures from this book
that we found in the attic.

1002
01:54:19,498 --> 01:54:22,712
Ex-FBI agent wrote that.
— Finding The Invisible Man.

1003
01:54:22,951 --> 01:54:25,003
It's about a theoretical
suspect that people believe

1004
01:54:25,023 --> 01:54:27,348
is responsible for a bunch
of child abductions.

1005
01:54:27,588 --> 01:54:30,443
This totally discredited, I guess but
I read some bits, kind of—

1006
01:54:30,498 --> 01:54:34,178
Taylor— Taylor was abducted when he was
a kid, he ran away after three weeks.

1007
01:54:34,225 --> 01:54:38,000
And the capturer drugged him on
some sort of LSD ketamine cocktail,

1008
01:54:38,063 --> 01:54:40,019
and he never remembered,
we never caught the guy.

1009
01:54:40,915 --> 01:54:45,357
And so… he read the book, and decided
he was taken by the Invisible Man.

1010
01:54:45,509 --> 01:54:48,155
Now he's doing his best imitation.
Right?

1011
01:54:51,081 --> 01:54:54,433
Yeah, he was doing his best imitation,
he killed himself last night.

1012
01:54:56,298 --> 01:54:58,859
Man, how did he do that,
I though he was in custody?

1013
01:55:06,626 --> 01:55:09,695
Taylor drew this, a map to the bodies.
It's a map to the bodies,

1014
01:55:09,734 --> 01:55:11,443
and we found the same
design on a pendant

1015
01:55:11,469 --> 01:55:13,271
that we pulled off that
corpse the other day.

1016
01:55:13,290 --> 01:55:15,073
— There's a connection. Okay?
— Yeah. Then?

1017
01:55:15,122 --> 01:55:16,916
The connection is his
last maze in the book.

1018
01:55:17,208 --> 01:55:19,245
I did it, it's unsolved,
but there is no way out.

1019
01:55:19,533 --> 01:55:22,507
Your corpse is— is another
wannabe who read the book.

1020
01:55:23,700 --> 01:55:25,890
What're you saying to me, Rich?
What're you saying me?

1021
01:55:25,943 --> 01:55:27,782
What're you saying,
that this guy's a fake?

1022
01:55:28,071 --> 01:55:30,957
You're saying that the girls,
these girls are out there somewhere.

1023
01:55:31,452 --> 01:55:33,529
How did Bob Taylor get those clothes?

1024
01:55:33,625 --> 01:55:39,002
How did— how did the parents
positively ID those clothes?

1025
01:55:40,969 --> 01:55:42,808
That, I can't reconcile.

1026
01:55:42,987 --> 01:55:44,157
You can't reconcile?

1027
01:55:44,212 --> 01:55:46,554
Just keep knocking on doors,
looking out windows…

1028
01:55:48,107 --> 01:55:49,962
Hey. Why is that there?
Tag that—

1029
01:56:00,095 --> 01:56:02,476
IN THE HOUSE
WINDOW — OPEN?

1030
01:57:19,750 --> 01:57:21,487
Yes.

1031
01:57:23,823 --> 01:57:27,290
Uhm… Yeah, this is she.

1032
01:57:30,206 --> 01:57:32,939
What?

1033
01:57:34,721 --> 01:57:39,221
Oh my God.
Uh, we… Is she… ?

1034
01:57:40,826 --> 01:57:42,935
Ralph, Keller!

1035
01:57:58,439 --> 01:58:01,722
Keller, we need to go to the hospital,
they found Joy but not Anna,

1036
01:58:01,763 --> 01:58:06,182
they find Anna, maybe she'll know
where Anna is, we have to go!

1037
01:58:06,907 --> 01:58:08,222
Keller!

1038
01:58:11,111 --> 01:58:13,053
Elisa's not picking up.

1039
01:58:13,271 --> 01:58:15,434
— Did you text her?
— Yeah.

1040
01:58:24,917 --> 01:58:27,653
— Oh, nobody gets behind this point.
— Please, don't touch me!

1041
01:58:27,713 --> 01:58:29,672
— Miss! Wait a minute!
— It's okay.

1042
01:58:30,664 --> 01:58:31,963
— Nancy.
— Grace.

1043
01:58:31,996 --> 01:58:34,232
You'll find Anna,
I know they will.

1044
01:58:34,252 --> 01:58:35,724
I know they will.
— I know.

1045
01:58:37,919 --> 01:58:40,427
— How is she?
— Is she awake?

1046
01:58:41,621 --> 01:58:45,660
Joy, were you far from the street?
How far from the street were you, Joy?

1047
01:58:45,990 --> 01:58:47,622
Joy.
— You can't be doing this now.

1048
01:58:47,657 --> 01:58:49,027
How long did it take you to get there?

1049
01:58:49,056 --> 01:58:50,877
— She's been through a lot.
— Just let me ask a question, please.

1050
01:58:50,925 --> 01:58:51,559
Keller!

1051
01:58:51,596 --> 01:58:54,815
The detective will be back in
just a minute, you need to wait.

1052
01:58:54,866 --> 01:58:56,094
She's been drugged.

1053
01:58:56,147 --> 01:58:58,289
Joy… Sweet heart…

1054
01:58:59,775 --> 01:59:02,066
Just let us know she's alive, okay?

1055
01:59:02,765 --> 01:59:05,834
You need just nod your head,
baby, just nod your head.

1056
01:59:06,452 --> 01:59:10,497
Baby… can you give us a nod,
can you nod your head for us, please?

1057
01:59:10,918 --> 01:59:11,942
Joy.

1058
01:59:23,384 --> 01:59:24,635
Joy.

1059
01:59:27,112 --> 01:59:30,301
FINISH ALL THE MAZES
AND YOU'LL GO HOME

1060
01:59:56,111 --> 01:59:58,703
You were there.

1061
01:59:59,574 --> 02:00:02,441
What? I wa—
I was where?

1062
02:00:04,010 --> 02:00:06,856
They put a tape on her mouth.

1063
02:00:09,122 --> 02:00:11,612
It's okay, it's okay honey…

1064
02:00:12,366 --> 02:00:13,951
It's okay, it's okay.

1065
02:00:14,552 --> 02:00:17,240
Mom and Dad are here, you're okay?

1066
02:00:17,455 --> 02:00:19,579
You're alright.
— Excuse me.

1067
02:00:19,715 --> 02:00:21,135
You're alright, now.

1068
02:00:21,194 --> 02:00:23,795
Yeah, I said nobody is allowed
in that room but her family.

1069
02:00:24,608 --> 02:00:26,788
— Hey! Where're you going?
— Keller?

1070
02:00:26,816 --> 02:00:29,564
— Hey! Where is he going?
— I don't know.

1071
02:00:31,246 --> 02:00:33,096
Call downstairs, don't let him go.

1072
02:00:38,629 --> 02:00:42,204
Get him off that car!
Stop him, hey!

1073
02:01:06,755 --> 02:01:08,213
Fucker.

1074
02:01:08,269 --> 02:01:10,446
I know where you're going.

1075
02:01:10,552 --> 02:01:12,748
I know where you're going.

1076
02:02:30,969 --> 02:02:32,802
Hello again.

1077
02:02:32,837 --> 02:02:35,549
Hey, I was hoping you'd, uh…

1078
02:02:35,613 --> 02:02:37,382
I need to do some penance.

1079
02:02:38,563 --> 02:02:40,236
For what?

1080
02:02:40,414 --> 02:02:44,178
For scaring you the other day
at the— at the station.

1081
02:02:44,229 --> 02:02:46,362
You already apologized for that.

1082
02:02:46,444 --> 02:02:49,751
I know, I was thinking
that maybe you, uh…

1083
02:02:50,259 --> 02:02:52,455
you could use some, uh… help around—

1084
02:02:52,465 --> 02:02:54,510
you know, I know your door
here needs some fixing,

1085
02:02:54,529 --> 02:02:56,176
so I brought my tools, and uh…

1086
02:02:56,329 --> 02:02:59,771
Ooh… I see.

1087
02:03:01,897 --> 02:03:06,041
I burned myself.
Feel a little wacky today.

1088
02:03:07,871 --> 02:03:13,073
But I'm glad you wanna talk some more.
No need to make excuses though.

1089
02:03:13,123 --> 02:03:16,549
Come on in and make me a cup of tea.

1090
02:03:24,957 --> 02:03:26,364
Come on in.

1091
02:03:46,002 --> 02:03:48,671
I don't wanna have to hurt you.

1092
02:03:50,899 --> 02:03:53,965
I know they were here.

1093
02:03:55,127 --> 02:03:57,818
Put ​​your hands on your head
and turn around.

1094
02:03:59,937 --> 02:04:01,388
Do it.

1095
02:04:04,637 --> 02:04:06,310
I'm just gonna go.

1096
02:04:06,758 --> 02:04:11,185
Don't touch that bag.
Put your hands on your head.

1097
02:04:16,234 --> 02:04:18,326
Come over here on this counter.
Come on.

1098
02:04:28,896 --> 02:04:32,824
Top drawer.
Open it.

1099
02:04:42,340 --> 02:04:44,303
Put ​​them on.

1100
02:04:53,631 --> 02:04:56,762
You don't know me, Mr. Dover.

1101
02:04:56,928 --> 02:05:00,477
But believe me when I tell you
I will not let you go.

1102
02:05:09,372 --> 02:05:11,867
You don't have to drink all of it.

1103
02:05:12,761 --> 02:05:15,583
About a third should do
for a man of your size.

1104
02:05:17,541 --> 02:05:19,118
Something to make you more manageable.

1105
02:05:19,431 --> 02:05:20,538
Forget it.

1106
02:05:20,563 --> 02:05:24,127
Drink it, Mr. Dover. Or I'll kill you
right here in my kitchen,

1107
02:05:24,202 --> 02:05:26,485
bring your daughter in here,
and have her scrub your brains

1108
02:05:26,501 --> 02:05:28,517
off that floor.
— Where is she?

1109
02:05:31,353 --> 02:05:33,249
Drink.

1110
02:05:33,867 --> 02:05:35,312
Just let me see her.

1111
02:05:35,355 --> 02:05:37,227
— You wanna see her?
— Yes.

1112
02:05:37,794 --> 02:05:41,008
That's your ticket to
your daughter right there.

1113
02:05:51,105 --> 02:05:54,102
A little more, Mr. Dover.
A little more.

1114
02:06:00,930 --> 02:06:02,825
Good.

1115
02:06:03,159 --> 02:06:05,758
This is my dear husband's recipe.

1116
02:06:12,764 --> 02:06:15,317
Now we're going out back.

1117
02:06:15,384 --> 02:06:17,365
Let me see her.

1118
02:06:22,753 --> 02:06:25,305
Take it out of your pocket.

1119
02:06:27,110 --> 02:06:28,808
Put it in the sink.

1120
02:06:31,658 --> 02:06:33,489
Put it in the disposal.

1121
02:06:41,803 --> 02:06:45,003
Put ​​your car keys on the table.

1122
02:06:47,618 --> 02:06:49,690
Put ​​the car keys on the table.

1123
02:06:53,983 --> 02:06:59,127
Over the TransAm, over here.
The car over there, come on, move it.

1124
02:07:07,739 --> 02:07:10,213
The look on your face.

1125
02:07:10,273 --> 02:07:12,495
My husband used to have
the very same look.

1126
02:07:13,309 --> 02:07:16,918
When we took Alex,
he was the first kid we ever took.

1127
02:07:17,456 --> 02:07:20,636
His name was a Jimmy… Ber— Barry.

1128
02:07:20,799 --> 02:07:23,368
I can't remember that, he can't either.

1129
02:07:23,892 --> 02:07:24,844
So many names.

1130
02:07:26,226 --> 02:07:30,860
Forgot all about Bobby Taylor,
until I read about him in the paper.

1131
02:07:33,390 --> 02:07:35,241
Get in the driver's seat.

1132
02:07:44,483 --> 02:07:46,758
Open the door and get in the car.

1133
02:08:01,775 --> 02:08:05,923
Making children disappear is
the war we wage against God.

1134
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:10,401
Makes people lose their faith…

1135
02:08:10,523 --> 02:08:13,253
turns them into demons like you.

1136
02:08:14,395 --> 02:08:17,480
I had to slow down
since my husband disappeared,

1137
02:08:18,455 --> 02:08:20,529
but I do what I can.

1138
02:08:22,682 --> 02:08:26,612
Start the car.
Start the car.

1139
02:08:32,015 --> 02:08:33,581
Keep trying.

1140
02:08:40,498 --> 02:08:42,944
Back up. Slowly.

1141
02:08:46,773 --> 02:08:49,688
Come on. Back up.

1142
02:08:51,754 --> 02:08:53,295
Come on…

1143
02:08:57,425 --> 02:09:00,115
Stop. Turn it off.

1144
02:09:01,147 --> 02:09:02,799
Turn it off!

1145
02:09:03,944 --> 02:09:06,014
Get out.

1146
02:09:14,247 --> 02:09:18,946
I think you should know.
Alex never laid a hand on those girls.

1147
02:09:19,007 --> 02:09:21,454
Just wanted to take him
for a ride in the camper.

1148
02:09:21,847 --> 02:09:24,626
I was the one who decided
they should stay.

1149
02:09:28,259 --> 02:09:30,223
Take a look.

1150
02:09:31,625 --> 02:09:35,219
Maybe your daughter is under there.
You never know.

1151
02:09:52,535 --> 02:09:56,129
I had the girls down there
when the police came poking around.

1152
02:09:57,593 --> 02:10:00,154
I should have left them down there.

1153
02:10:00,323 --> 02:10:02,614
I'm so lonely without Alex.

1154
02:10:04,330 --> 02:10:06,312
Get in there.

1155
02:10:06,363 --> 02:10:09,249
— What?
— Get in.

1156
02:10:13,073 --> 02:10:15,520
If you want me to get in there,
you're gonna have to shoot me.

1157
02:10:16,630 --> 02:10:19,031
I'm not gonna get in
just 'cause you ask.

1158
02:10:22,513 --> 02:10:26,120
Oh! God!

1159
02:10:30,659 --> 02:10:33,416
Go on. Get in there.

1160
02:10:41,105 --> 02:10:43,394
That's good.

1161
02:11:01,946 --> 02:11:07,197
Make yourself a tourniquet.
This might last 24 hours.

1162
02:11:12,273 --> 02:11:16,044
I'd love you to still be alive when
I dump your daughter's body down there.

1163
02:11:22,644 --> 02:11:25,577
Wait, no, wait wait wait!
Wait!

1164
02:11:56,746 --> 02:11:59,196
I need you to go to Holly Jones,
she needs to be notified.

1165
02:11:59,283 --> 02:12:00,423
No, I'm gonna find Dover.

1166
02:12:00,449 --> 02:12:02,142
No, you're done
with Dover, okay?

1167
02:12:02,168 --> 02:12:03,954
— Please.
— Ok, you want me to go to Holly Jones?

1168
02:12:03,973 --> 02:12:07,452
I want you to go Holly Jones
as a notifier, please.

1169
02:12:38,257 --> 02:12:39,668
Oh God.

1170
02:13:36,228 --> 02:13:39,543
Almighty God… Protect my girl…

1171
02:14:53,500 --> 02:14:55,372
Mrs. Jones?

1172
02:15:07,115 --> 02:15:08,851
Mrs. Jones.

1173
02:16:40,334 --> 02:16:42,382
Show me your hands right now.

1174
02:16:42,867 --> 02:16:45,623
Don't move and show me
your fucking hands, right now.

1175
02:16:46,135 --> 02:16:47,672
Stop, right now!

1176
02:16:47,713 --> 02:16:50,335
Show me your fucking hands,
do not move and show me your hands.

1177
02:16:51,400 --> 02:16:55,501
Make sure they cremate me, I'm sure
I don't want to be buried in some box.

1178
02:16:55,531 --> 02:16:58,154
Both hands, right now!
Right now!

1179
02:17:15,498 --> 02:17:17,708
Oh, my God.

1180
02:17:34,349 --> 02:17:35,603
Oh God!

1181
02:17:55,431 --> 02:17:57,125
Oh shit!

1182
02:18:13,820 --> 02:18:17,573
Come on. Come on, uh.
Aah, go!

1183
02:18:21,213 --> 02:18:24,056
Stay with me Anna.
You're gonna stay with me, uh?

1184
02:18:24,104 --> 02:18:26,349
I need you to— stay with me, Anna!

1185
02:18:34,342 --> 02:18:37,411
Stay with me, Anna, it's alright.
It's alright, come on!

1186
02:18:37,460 --> 02:18:39,415
Come on, move, move,
move, move!

1187
02:18:48,507 --> 02:18:51,350
Don't die. Don't die.

1188
02:19:17,392 --> 02:19:19,199
It's okay.
It's okay.

1189
02:19:21,231 --> 02:19:24,770
Hey. It's okay.
Hey. Hey!

1190
02:19:26,227 --> 02:19:29,724
Hey! Help!
Help!

1191
02:19:29,876 --> 02:19:33,717
Help!
Help! Help!

1192
02:19:56,332 --> 02:19:58,362
Uh, Detective Loki?

1193
02:20:00,800 --> 02:20:03,007
I hope we're not intruding.

1194
02:20:09,625 --> 02:20:11,950
She's doing real good.

1195
02:20:12,858 --> 02:20:15,641
She's gonna be… up and around
in a few days, and she…

1196
02:20:15,714 --> 02:20:19,021
She just wanted to come and say
thank you and hi to her hero.

1197
02:20:25,601 --> 02:20:27,320
Hello.

1198
02:20:35,926 --> 02:20:38,570
Uh… Do you mind giving me a minute?

1199
02:20:39,456 --> 02:20:41,755
— Yeah.
— Thank you. Say goodbye Joy.

1200
02:20:42,557 --> 02:20:44,435
Say goodbye, Anna.

1201
02:21:11,235 --> 02:21:13,970
She found her whistle, yeah?

1202
02:21:14,978 --> 02:21:17,991
No. She keeps insisting
that Joy helped her

1203
02:21:18,016 --> 02:21:20,983
find it on Thanksgiving
before they were taken.

1204
02:21:21,928 --> 02:21:25,100
I think she's just confused though.

1205
02:21:25,621 --> 02:21:27,562
I got her a new one.

1206
02:21:44,224 --> 02:21:46,654
He hasn't contacted me.

1207
02:21:49,326 --> 02:21:52,328
I know you d… I know you probably
don't believe it, but he hasn't.

1208
02:22:01,785 --> 02:22:04,276
I b— I believe you.

1209
02:22:11,891 --> 02:22:14,185
Do you think you're gonna find him?

1210
02:22:18,813 --> 02:22:20,508
Yeah.

1211
02:22:21,361 --> 02:22:23,518
And he'll go to jail?

1212
02:22:25,382 --> 02:22:27,210
Probably.

1213
02:22:33,434 --> 02:22:35,090
Thanks for everything.

1214
02:22:38,960 --> 02:22:40,766
Oh, God…

1215
02:22:51,401 --> 02:22:54,357
I miss him.

1216
02:22:57,221 --> 02:23:01,677
He d-… He did what he had to do
to find Anna, and I thank God for that.

1217
02:23:13,382 --> 02:23:16,383
He is a good man.

1218
02:23:50,086 --> 02:23:52,067
That's it, let's pack it up.

1219
02:24:00,444 --> 02:24:02,473
You're done for tonight?

1220
02:24:02,490 --> 02:24:03,686
Yeah, the ground's frozen, so

1221
02:24:03,689 --> 02:24:06,646
it's just gonna take a week
to excavate the entire property.

1222
02:24:07,187 --> 02:24:09,727
We just found some dead snakes and shit.

1223
02:24:11,862 --> 02:24:14,838
Pray for the best,
prepare for the worst, yeah?

1224
02:24:17,265 --> 02:24:19,581
G'night.

1225
02:24:21,184 --> 02:24:22,770
G'night.
