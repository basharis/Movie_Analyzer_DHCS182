1
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,917
I didn't know it was so bad.

2
00:07:06,325 --> 00:07:10,659
Couple of incendiaries,
these old buildings go up like cellophane.

3
00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:15,927
There's a wall that separates
the old section of Nuremberg from the new.

4
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:17,560
Goes back to...

5
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:20,368
How far does it go back, Schmidt?

6
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,908
- 1219, sir.
- 1219.

7
00:07:25,344 --> 00:07:29,007
This is where the Nazi Party
held their rallies, isn't it?

8
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:33,309
They all came here.
Hitler. Goebbels. The whole crew.

9
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:36,351
Thousands of them, 
from all over Germany.

10
00:07:44,263 --> 00:07:47,164
Does he have to blow 
that damn horn so much?

11
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,767
It's not necessary to blow 
the horn so much, Schmidt.

12
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:04,673
You both know your duties?

13
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:08,011
Well, here we are.
A little bit of old Germany.

14
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:09,983
- Senator Burkette.
- Captain.

15
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:12,183
Captain Byers, this is Judge Haywood.

16
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:14,818
- Byers here will be your aide.
- My what?

17
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:18,523
Clerk. General guide. Liaison.
Any capacity you wish to use me in.

18
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:21,192
This will be your staff, sir.
Mr. And Mrs. Halbestadt.

19
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:22,325
Hello.

20
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:25,199
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon, Your Honor.

21
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:26,329
Welcome.

22
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:28,270
You've already met your driver, Schmidt.

23
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:31,139
I am at your service any time you need me.
Day or night.

24
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:32,404
Thanks.

25
00:08:32,478 --> 00:08:35,174
Let's show him around
the rest of the place. Dan?

26
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:37,375
We're in the reception room.

27
00:08:39,385 --> 00:08:40,784
Living room.

28
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,444
Study is in there.

29
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:45,923
There are two bedrooms on this floor,
three upstairs.

30
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:50,525
Furniture is part antique, part US Army.

31
00:08:55,735 --> 00:09:00,001
The piano's showing signs of wear and tear,
but it's a genuine Bechstein.

32
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:02,700
Quite a view, isn't it, sir?

33
00:09:06,445 --> 00:09:09,039
Senator, I really don't need all this.

34
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:11,950
The United States government
always does it right.

35
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:13,986
- You know that, Dan.
- Who used to live here?

36
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:16,283
An important Nazi general and his wife, sir.

37
00:09:16,355 --> 00:09:19,381
Let's see. Is there anything else
Judge Haywood ought to know?

38
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:21,323
Sir, are there any questions?

39
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:22,486
Yes.

40
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:25,997
- You're West Point, aren't you, Captain?
- Yes, sir.

41
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:28,863
- What's your first name?
- Harrison. Harry.

42
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:31,262
Harry, look, I'm not West Point.

43
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:35,899
And all this formality gets me down a little,
not to say puts me ill at ease.

44
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:39,001
Do you think it would be
too much an infraction of the rules...

45
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:41,945
if you were to call me Judge,
or Dan, or something?

46
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:43,413
Okay, Judge.

47
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:45,473
We shop at the army commissary.

48
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:48,315
There isn't enough food at the local markets
for the Germans.

49
00:09:48,387 --> 00:09:49,786
The driver knows where it is.

50
00:09:49,855 --> 00:09:53,882
Here's a copy of the indictment of the case.
Thought you might want to look it over.

51
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,292
I hope you'll be comfortable here, sir.

52
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:59,889
Captain, I think the whole state of Maine
would be comfortable here.

53
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:02,594
My office is next to yours
at the Palace of Justice...

54
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:04,465
- if you need anything.
- Thank you.

55
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:05,765
Senator?

56
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:14,536
Do you think
I really need the three servants?

57
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:17,105
It kind of makes me feel like a damn fool.

58
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:21,545
It helps them out, as well as you.
You see, here they eat.

59
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:25,116
I need three servants.

60
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:29,160
It's good to have a man
of your stature here, Dan.

61
00:10:29,228 --> 00:10:30,354
Sure.

62
00:10:30,663 --> 00:10:34,030
I was the only man in America
qualified for this job.

63
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:37,661
Senator, you know I wasn't the first choice,
nor even the tenth.

64
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:39,864
- You know it, and I know it.
- What do you mean?

65
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:42,965
Let's face it.
Hitler is gone, Goebbels is gone.

66
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:45,909
Goering is gone. Committed suicide
before they could hang him.

67
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:49,744
Now we're down to the business of judging 
the doctors, businessmen and judges.

68
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:52,045
Some people think
they shouldn't be judged at all.

69
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:53,142
So?

70
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:56,953
So it makes for a hell of a lack 
of candidates for the job.

71
00:10:57,023 --> 00:11:00,891
You had to beat the backwoods of Maine
to come up with a hick like me.

72
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,951
I hope you're not sorry you came.

73
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:05,020
No. I'm not sorry I came.

74
00:11:05,097 --> 00:11:08,260
I just wanted you to know
that I know where the body is buried.

75
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,734
No, I think the trials should go on.

76
00:11:10,803 --> 00:11:14,466
Especially the trials of the German judges.
I hope I'm up to it.

77
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:16,801
You're up to it.

78
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:18,406
Relax.

79
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:20,036
Thanks.

80
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:22,342
Enjoy this place while you can.

81
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:24,474
You're going to be a pretty busy fellow.

82
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:26,245
Thanks for everything, Senator.

83
00:11:26,318 --> 00:11:28,548
- See you tomorrow, Judge.
- Right.

84
00:11:29,588 --> 00:11:32,148
Shall we take these upstairs?

85
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,388
Yes. Thank you.

86
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:41,732
- Here, I can take that--
- No, let me take it. Please.

87
00:12:17,803 --> 00:12:19,361
Here they come.

88
00:12:51,036 --> 00:12:53,334
The tribunal is now in session.

89
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:56,966
God bless the United States
and this honorable tribunal.

90
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:33,907
The tribunal will now arraign the defendants.

91
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:38,109
The microphone will be placed
in front of the defendant, Emil Hahn.

92
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:45,255
Emil Hahn?

93
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:48,259
Are you represented by counsel
before this tribunal?

94
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:54,830
Not guilty.

95
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:58,392
The question was, are you represented
by counsel before this tribunal?

96
00:14:03,642 --> 00:14:05,075
I am represented.

97
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:08,011
How do you plead to the charges
and specifications...

98
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:11,379
in the indictment against you?
Guilty or not guilty?

99
00:14:13,652 --> 00:14:15,677
Not guilty on all counts.

100
00:14:16,555 --> 00:14:18,420
Friedrich Hoffstetter?

101
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:23,420
Are you represented by counsel
before this tribunal?

102
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:26,461
I am represented.

103
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:29,228
How do you plead? 
Guilty or not guilty?

104
00:14:32,104 --> 00:14:33,765
You may be seated.

105
00:14:38,844 --> 00:14:40,368
Werner Lammpe?

106
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:48,850
Are you represented by counsel
before this tribunal?

107
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:50,449
Counsel?

108
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,460
Yes, of course. 
I am represented.

109
00:14:58,797 --> 00:15:02,255
How do you plead to the charges?
Guilty or not guilty?

110
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:06,865
You may be seated.

111
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:11,232
Ernst Janning?

112
00:15:12,711 --> 00:15:16,010
Are you represented by counsel
before this tribunal?

113
00:15:35,734 --> 00:15:39,033
Are you represented by counsel
before this tribunal?

114
00:15:49,848 --> 00:15:52,476
I represent the defendant, Your Honor.

115
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:57,082
How do you plead to the charges
and specifications set forth...

116
00:15:57,156 --> 00:16:00,455
in the indictment against you?
Guilty or not guilty?

117
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:07,422
Your Honor, may I address the court?

118
00:16:19,411 --> 00:16:22,505
The defendant does not recognize
the authority of this tribunal...

119
00:16:22,581 --> 00:16:26,142
and wishes to lodge a formal protest
in lieu of pleading.

120
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:29,246
A plea of "not guilty" will be entered.

121
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:46,429
The prosecution will begin 
its opening address.

122
00:16:47,906 --> 00:16:49,237
Slow and easy, Junior.

123
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:05,787
The case is unusual...

124
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:09,422
in that the defendants
are charged with crimes...

125
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:11,929
committed in the name of the law.

126
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:16,992
These men, together with their deceased
or fugitive colleagues...

127
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:22,933
are the embodiment of what passed for justice 
during the Third Reich.

128
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:28,509
The defendants served as judges
during the period of the Third Reich.

129
00:17:29,648 --> 00:17:33,106
Therefore, you, Your Honors,
as judges on the bench...

130
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:35,683
will be sitting in judgment...

131
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:38,355
of judges in the dock.

132
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,252
And this is as it should be.

133
00:17:42,761 --> 00:17:47,130
For only a judge knows
how much more a court is than a courtroom.

134
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,895
It is a process and a spirit.

135
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,471
It is the house of law.

136
00:17:57,009 --> 00:18:00,570
The defendants knew this, too.
They knew courtrooms well.

137
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:02,575
They sat in their black robes...

138
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:07,108
and they distorted, they perverted,
they destroyed justice and law in Germany.

139
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:10,451
Will the prosecution please watch the light?

140
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:14,656
- The interpreter cannot follow you.
- I'm sorry, Your Honor.

141
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:17,762
They distorted, they perverted...

142
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:21,691
they destroyed justice and law in Germany.

143
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:26,598
Now, this in itself
is undoubtedly a great crime.

144
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:29,366
But the prosecution
is not calling the defendants...

145
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:32,842
to account for violating
constitutional guarantees...

146
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:35,379
or withholding due process of law.

147
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:39,150
The prosecution
is calling them to account...

148
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:41,283
for murder...

149
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:43,687
brutalities...

150
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:46,352
torture...

151
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:48,758
atrocities.

152
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:53,561
They share with all the leaders
of the Third Reich...

153
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:57,193
responsibility for the most malignant,
the most calculated...

154
00:18:57,269 --> 00:19:00,932
the most devastating crimes
in the history of all mankind.

155
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:04,970
And they are perhaps more guilty
than some of the others.

156
00:19:05,043 --> 00:19:09,446
For they had attained maturity
long before Hitler's rise to power.

157
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:14,379
Their minds weren't warped at an early age
by Nazi teachings.

158
00:19:15,053 --> 00:19:19,956
They embraced the ideologies
of the Third Reich as educated adults...

159
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:23,627
when they, most of all...

160
00:19:23,695 --> 00:19:25,788
should have valued justice.

161
00:19:31,603 --> 00:19:34,936
Here they'll receive the justice
they denied others.

162
00:19:37,242 --> 00:19:41,736
They'll be judged according to the evidence
presented in this courtroom.

163
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:44,815
The prosecution asks nothing more.

164
00:19:48,887 --> 00:19:52,584
<i>Herr</i> Rolfe will make 
the opening statement for the defense.

165
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,535
May it please the tribunal...

166
00:20:12,978 --> 00:20:15,276
it is not only a great honor...

167
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:19,008
but also a great challenge...

168
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:21,184
for an advocate...

169
00:20:23,121 --> 00:20:25,555
to aid this tribunal in its task.

170
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:29,685
The entire civilized world...

171
00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:33,029
will follow closely what we do here.

172
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,968
For this is not an ordinary trial...

173
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:41,338
by any means of the accepted, 
parochial sense.

174
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:46,073
The avowed purpose of this tribunal...

175
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:49,705
Is broader than the visiting of retribution
on a few men.

176
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:54,480
It is dedicated to the reconsecration...

177
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:57,578
of the temple of justice.

178
00:20:57,656 --> 00:21:00,784
It is dedicated to finding a code of justice...

179
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:03,723
the whole world will be responsible to.

180
00:21:07,132 --> 00:21:09,566
How will this code be established?

181
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:14,729
It will be established...

182
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:18,999
in a clear...

183
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:22,570
honest evaluation...

184
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:27,517
of the responsibility for the crimes
in the indictment stated by the prosecution.

185
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:33,254
In the words of the great American jurist,
Oliver Wendell Holmes:

186
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:37,587
"This responsibility will not be found
only in documents...

187
00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:40,029
"that no one contests or denies.

188
00:21:40,732 --> 00:21:44,896
"It will be found in considerations
of a political or social nature.

189
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:49,198
"It will be found, most of all...

190
00:21:50,776 --> 00:21:52,801
"in the character of men."

191
00:21:55,514 --> 00:21:58,210
What is the character of Ernst Janning?

192
00:22:00,552 --> 00:22:03,146
Let us examine his life for a moment.

193
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:06,453
He was born in 1885.

194
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:10,128
Received the degree
of Doctor of Law in 1907.

195
00:22:10,195 --> 00:22:12,959
Became a judge in East Prussia in 1940.

196
00:22:13,031 --> 00:22:16,694
Following WWI, he became one
of the leaders of the Weimar Republic...

197
00:22:16,768 --> 00:22:19,669
and was one of the framers
of its democratic constitution.

198
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:22,536
In subsequent years
he achieved international fame...

199
00:22:22,607 --> 00:22:26,805
not only for his work as a great jurist,
but also as the author of legal text books...

200
00:22:26,878 --> 00:22:29,870
which are still used in universities
all over the world.

201
00:22:29,948 --> 00:22:33,816
He became Minister of Justice
in Germany in 1935.

202
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,853
If Ernst Janning is to be found guilty...

203
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:40,825
certain implications must arise.

204
00:22:41,593 --> 00:22:45,256
A judge does not make the laws.

205
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:49,595
He carries out the laws of his country.

206
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:52,565
The statement:

207
00:22:52,637 --> 00:22:55,299
"My country, right or wrong..."

208
00:22:56,508 --> 00:22:59,341
was expressed by a great American patriot.

209
00:23:01,747 --> 00:23:04,477
It is no less true for a German patriot.

210
00:23:08,253 --> 00:23:12,087
Should Ernst Janning have carried out
the laws of his country?

211
00:23:12,157 --> 00:23:16,150
Or should he have refused to carry them out
and become a traitor?

212
00:23:16,762 --> 00:23:20,391
This is the crux of the issue
at the bottom of this trial.

213
00:23:24,336 --> 00:23:27,828
The defense is as dedicated
to finding responsibility...

214
00:23:29,107 --> 00:23:31,007
as is the prosecution.

215
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:36,442
For it is not only Ernst Janning
who is on trial here...

216
00:23:40,685 --> 00:23:42,676
it is the German people.

217
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:50,091
The tribunal will recess
until further notification.

218
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:31,633
If it's all right with you,
Byers can file these briefs later.

219
00:24:32,938 --> 00:24:36,635
That was quite a damning speech
by Col. Lawson, wasn't it?

220
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:40,740
I wonder if those men in the dock
can really be responsible...

221
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:42,939
for the things he listed in the indictment.

222
00:24:43,014 --> 00:24:45,881
I've been here for two years,
and after that long...

223
00:24:45,951 --> 00:24:49,546
you find that responsibility
is not a cut-and-dried thing.

224
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:52,354
What are you fellows up to
over the weekend?

225
00:24:52,424 --> 00:24:54,858
My wife and I are going to Liège.

226
00:24:54,926 --> 00:24:57,156
There's nothing in Liège. 
I've been there.

227
00:24:57,229 --> 00:24:59,197
My son was in the 101st.

228
00:24:59,264 --> 00:25:02,290
He's buried in the American cemetery
outside Liège.

229
00:25:02,901 --> 00:25:04,266
I'm sorry.

230
00:25:04,636 --> 00:25:06,263
That's all right.

231
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:08,101
See you Monday, Dan.

232
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:11,308
Coming my way?

233
00:25:11,376 --> 00:25:15,540
No, I'm going to stay here for a moment.
I'm waiting for some records from Byers.

234
00:25:15,614 --> 00:25:16,774
Right.

235
00:25:38,603 --> 00:25:40,537
Here are the reports you asked for, sir.

236
00:25:40,605 --> 00:25:41,970
Thank you.

237
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:49,040
Captain, do you think you can get me a copy
of the books Ernst Janning wrote?

238
00:25:49,414 --> 00:25:52,508
- There are quite a few of them.
- I'd like all of them.

239
00:25:52,584 --> 00:25:55,052
And also a copy of the Weimar constitution.

240
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,384
- Do you think you can get that for me?
- Of course.

241
00:25:57,455 --> 00:25:58,786
Thank you.

242
00:26:02,794 --> 00:26:05,991
- How long have you been here, Captain?
- Two years.

243
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:08,862
- Two years? That's a long time.
- Yes, sir.

244
00:26:09,034 --> 00:26:11,025
- Any friends?
- Sure.

245
00:26:13,171 --> 00:26:14,695
German friends?

246
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:15,964
Yes.

247
00:26:16,808 --> 00:26:18,002
A girl?

248
00:26:18,276 --> 00:26:19,436
Yes.

249
00:26:20,312 --> 00:26:23,338
Her parents were Nazis,
but she was eight when they came in.

250
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:25,110
- I didn't ask you that.
- I know.

251
00:26:25,183 --> 00:26:28,516
But maybe you were thinking it.
It's natural to think about it.

252
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:32,148
I thought if anybody was going to 
indoctrinate her, it might as well be me.

253
00:26:32,223 --> 00:26:33,417
Will there be anything else?

254
00:26:33,491 --> 00:26:36,153
No, I think I'll just take a walk 
around town on my own.

255
00:26:36,227 --> 00:26:39,196
Try the old section.
Everyone stops for beer and sausage there.

256
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:40,595
Thank you.

257
00:28:10,221 --> 00:28:12,553
- Do you understand English?
- Yes, a little.

258
00:28:12,624 --> 00:28:16,060
- What did she say?
- She said, "Goodbye, Grandpa."

259
00:29:30,168 --> 00:29:31,863
Are they treating you all right?

260
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:34,427
Yes. They're treating me all right.

261
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:36,700
We still have some friends...

262
00:29:37,142 --> 00:29:39,940
who have contact
with the American authorities.

263
00:29:40,145 --> 00:29:42,579
I can tell them
if they're not treating you all right.

264
00:29:42,647 --> 00:29:44,877
They're treating me all right.

265
00:29:47,752 --> 00:29:49,379
Dr. Janning...

266
00:29:51,823 --> 00:29:54,348
we are both in an embarrassing position.

267
00:29:54,425 --> 00:29:56,620
I know you didn't want me as your counsel.

268
00:29:56,694 --> 00:29:58,889
I know you didn't want anyone.

269
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:04,166
But I must tell you something.
Will you listen to me?

270
00:30:04,669 --> 00:30:05,761
Yes.

271
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,701
I intend to represent your case
with complete dignity.

272
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:15,309
There will be...

273
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:20,975
no appeal to sentiment,
no falling at the mercy of the court.

274
00:30:21,619 --> 00:30:22,984
The game...

275
00:30:24,355 --> 00:30:27,654
will be played according to their own rules.

276
00:30:29,394 --> 00:30:34,058
We'll see whether they have the courage
to sit in judgment on a man like you.

277
00:30:35,867 --> 00:30:37,630
The way I see it...

278
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:43,206
the most important elements in the case...

279
00:30:44,142 --> 00:30:48,203
are the sterilization decrees,
and the Feldenstein-Hoffman affair.

280
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:57,086
Dr. Janning, I must tell you something.

281
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,852
I admired you...

282
00:31:05,163 --> 00:31:07,688
since I was a boy in the university.

283
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:12,468
It was because I thought
I might be able to achieve...

284
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:14,971
some of the things you have done...

285
00:31:19,244 --> 00:31:21,337
that saw me through the war.

286
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:26,647
You have been somebody to look up to,
for all of us.

287
00:31:29,854 --> 00:31:31,822
Is that all, <i>Herr</i> Rolfe?

288
00:31:36,594 --> 00:31:37,652
Yes.

289
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:39,060
Thank you.

290
00:31:49,107 --> 00:31:53,100
Dr. Wieck, do you know the defendant,
Ernst Janning?

291
00:31:56,214 --> 00:31:57,875
Yes, I know him.

292
00:31:57,949 --> 00:32:00,383
Will you tell us in what capacity?

293
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:05,818
We served in the Ministry of Justice together
from 1929 till 1935.

294
00:32:06,457 --> 00:32:08,516
Did you know him before that?

295
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:09,651
Yes.

296
00:32:10,695 --> 00:32:12,526
He was a law student of mine.

297
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:14,258
- Did you know him well?
- Yes.

298
00:32:14,332 --> 00:32:16,129
- Was he a protégé of yours?
- Yes.

299
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,258
Why?

300
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:21,537
He was always a man of great intelligence.

301
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:26,801
He was a man born with the qualities
of a great legal mind.

302
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:34,718
Would you tell us
from your own experience...

303
00:32:35,353 --> 00:32:40,188
the position of the judge in Germany
prior to the advent of Adolf Hitler.

304
00:32:41,893 --> 00:32:45,590
The position of the judge
was one of complete independence.

305
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:50,230
Now, would you describe the contrast, 
if any...

306
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:54,969
after the coming to power
of National Socialism in 1933?

307
00:32:55,673 --> 00:33:00,133
Judges became subject
to something outside of objective justice.

308
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:06,382
They became subject to what was necessary
for the protection of the country.

309
00:33:07,385 --> 00:33:09,250
Would you explain this, please?

310
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,151
The first consideration of the judge...

311
00:33:11,222 --> 00:33:14,316
became the punishment of acts
against the state...

312
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:18,159
rather than objective consideration
of the case.

313
00:33:18,396 --> 00:33:20,830
And what other changes were there?

314
00:33:21,466 --> 00:33:24,492
The right to appeal was eliminated.

315
00:33:25,303 --> 00:33:28,466
The Supreme Court of the Reich
was replaced by...

316
00:33:29,407 --> 00:33:31,568
People's and Special Courts.

317
00:33:32,777 --> 00:33:37,646
The concept of race was made 
a legal concept for the first time.

318
00:33:38,249 --> 00:33:40,581
And what was the result of this?

319
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:42,717
The result?

320
00:33:44,555 --> 00:33:48,286
The result was to hand over 
the administration of justice...

321
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:50,850
into the hands of the dictatorship.

322
00:33:51,229 --> 00:33:52,560
Now, Dr. Wieck...

323
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:55,963
Col. Lawson, I would like
to ask a few questions.

324
00:33:56,667 --> 00:34:01,070
Did the judiciary protest these laws
abridging their independence?

325
00:34:01,139 --> 00:34:02,800
A few of them did.

326
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:06,204
Those who did resigned,
or were forced to resign.

327
00:34:10,481 --> 00:34:13,541
Others adapted themselves
to the new situation.

328
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:19,212
Do you think the judiciary was aware
of the consequences to come?

329
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:22,089
At first, perhaps not.

330
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:28,328
Later it became clear to anyone
who had eyes and ears.

331
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:29,730
Thank you.

332
00:34:31,269 --> 00:34:35,899
Now, would you please describe for us
the changes in criminal law?

333
00:34:36,707 --> 00:34:38,732
It was characterized by...

334
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:42,041
an ever-increasing inflation
of the death penalty.

335
00:34:43,014 --> 00:34:45,744
Sentences were passed against defendants...

336
00:34:45,817 --> 00:34:50,516
just because they were Poles, or Jews,
or politically undesirable.

337
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:55,817
Novel National Socialist measures
were introduced.

338
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,525
Among them...

339
00:34:57,595 --> 00:35:02,032
sexual sterilization for those
who were categorized as asocial.

340
00:35:02,366 --> 00:35:04,766
Did it become necessary for judges...

341
00:35:04,836 --> 00:35:09,296
to wear any distinctive mark
on their robes in 1935?

342
00:35:09,907 --> 00:35:12,171
The so-called Fuehrer's Decree...

343
00:35:12,243 --> 00:35:16,407
required judges to wear the insignia
of the swastika on their robes.

344
00:35:16,747 --> 00:35:19,238
- Did you wear such an insignia?
- No.

345
00:35:20,251 --> 00:35:22,515
I would have been ashamed to wear it.

346
00:35:22,587 --> 00:35:24,851
Did you resign in 1935?

347
00:35:25,089 --> 00:35:26,351
Yes, sir.

348
00:35:26,924 --> 00:35:29,916
Did Ernst Janning wear a swastika
on his robe?

349
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:35,356
Yes.

350
00:35:36,534 --> 00:35:38,399
That's all. Thank you.

351
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:44,339
<i>Herr</i> Rolfe.

352
00:35:56,120 --> 00:36:00,716
You used the phrase, "What was necessary
for the protection of the country."

353
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,885
Will you explain for the tribunal...

354
00:36:04,962 --> 00:36:08,796
the conditions in Germany at the time
National Socialism came to power?

355
00:36:08,866 --> 00:36:10,458
What conditions?

356
00:36:13,871 --> 00:36:16,237
Would you say there was widespread hunger?

357
00:36:16,307 --> 00:36:17,467
Yes.

358
00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:20,067
Would you say there was internal disunity?

359
00:36:20,144 --> 00:36:21,202
Yes.

360
00:36:21,412 --> 00:36:23,277
Was there a Communist Party?

361
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:24,371
Yes.

362
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:27,315
Was it the third-largest party in Germany?

363
00:36:27,385 --> 00:36:28,443
Yes.

364
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,612
Would you say...

365
00:36:31,656 --> 00:36:35,990
that National Socialism helped to cure
some of these conditions?

366
00:36:36,961 --> 00:36:38,861
Yes, but at a terrible price--

367
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:42,832
Please confine yourself
to answering the questions only.

368
00:36:44,435 --> 00:36:48,531
Therefore, was it not possible
that a judge might wear a swastika...

369
00:36:48,606 --> 00:36:51,541
and yet work for what he thought 
was best for his country?

370
00:36:51,609 --> 00:36:53,600
No. It was not possible.

371
00:37:01,452 --> 00:37:03,579
You were not in the administration...

372
00:37:03,654 --> 00:37:07,988
from the years 1935 to 1943...

373
00:37:08,693 --> 00:37:10,558
by your own admission.

374
00:37:11,329 --> 00:37:15,663
Is it not possible
that your view of the administration...

375
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:18,193
might be distorted?

376
00:37:18,836 --> 00:37:20,326
No. It is not.

377
00:37:21,973 --> 00:37:26,307
How can you testify about
what was going on in the administration...

378
00:37:26,377 --> 00:37:27,935
if you were not there?

379
00:37:28,012 --> 00:37:30,742
I had many friends
in the legal administration.

380
00:37:30,815 --> 00:37:33,045
There were journals and books.

381
00:37:34,785 --> 00:37:37,413
From journals and books?

382
00:37:41,392 --> 00:37:42,689
I see.

383
00:37:44,829 --> 00:37:47,059
You referred to:

384
00:37:47,131 --> 00:37:49,861
"Novel National Socialist measures introduced...

385
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:52,300
"among them sexual sterilization."

386
00:37:53,471 --> 00:37:57,567
Are you aware that sexual sterilization
was not invented by National Socialism...

387
00:37:57,642 --> 00:38:00,509
but had been advanced 
for years before as a weapon...

388
00:38:00,578 --> 00:38:03,877
in dealing with the mentally incompetent
and the criminal?

389
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:05,779
Yes. I am aware of that.

390
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:10,150
Are you aware that it has advocates
among leading citizens in other countries?

391
00:38:10,221 --> 00:38:12,553
I am not an expert on such laws.

392
00:38:13,924 --> 00:38:16,358
Then permit me to read one to you.

393
00:38:20,164 --> 00:38:22,428
This is a High Court opinion...

394
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:26,830
upholding such laws in existence
in another country.

395
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:30,038
And I quote:

396
00:38:35,112 --> 00:38:37,979
"We have seen more than once
that the public welfare...

397
00:38:38,049 --> 00:38:40,950
"may call upon the best citizens
for their lives.

398
00:38:41,018 --> 00:38:44,385
"It would be strange indeed,
if it could not call upon those...

399
00:38:44,455 --> 00:38:48,585
"who already sapped the strength of the state 
for these lesser sacrifices...

400
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:52,095
"in order to prevent our being 
swamped by incompetence.

401
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:53,630
"It is better for all the world...

402
00:38:53,698 --> 00:38:56,997
"if, instead of waiting to execute
degenerate offsprings for crime...

403
00:38:57,068 --> 00:39:01,528
"or to let them starve for their imbecility,
society can prevent their propagation...

404
00:39:01,605 --> 00:39:04,574
"by medical means in the first place.

405
00:39:07,545 --> 00:39:10,480
"Three generations of imbeciles are enough."

406
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:16,509
Do you recognize it now, Dr. Wieck?

407
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:18,515
No, sir, I don't.

408
00:39:19,457 --> 00:39:22,858
Actually, there is no 
particular reason you should...

409
00:39:23,094 --> 00:39:25,756
since the opinion upholds
the sterilization law...

410
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:28,993
in the State of Virginia,
of the United States...

411
00:39:29,433 --> 00:39:32,459
and was written and delivered
by that great American jurist...

412
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:37,530
Supreme Court Justice,
Oliver Wendell Holmes.

413
00:39:47,585 --> 00:39:50,315
Now, Dr. Wieck.

414
00:39:51,489 --> 00:39:53,923
In view of what you have just learned...

415
00:39:53,991 --> 00:39:58,860
can you still say that sexual sterilization
was a novel National Socialist measure?

416
00:39:58,929 --> 00:40:00,396
Yes, I can say it.

417
00:40:01,432 --> 00:40:05,892
Because it was never before used
as a weapon against political opponents.

418
00:40:07,972 --> 00:40:09,940
Do you personally know of a case...

419
00:40:10,007 --> 00:40:13,272
where someone was sterilized
for political reasons?

420
00:40:13,778 --> 00:40:15,609
I know that such things were done.

421
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:18,978
That's not the question.
Please answer the question.

422
00:40:19,817 --> 00:40:21,375
Do you know of a case?

423
00:40:21,452 --> 00:40:25,013
I don't know of any specific case,
or specific date--

424
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:29,856
I am asking you if you have any firsthand,
personal knowledge of such a case!

425
00:40:30,161 --> 00:40:33,153
No, I have no such personal knowledge.

426
00:40:33,664 --> 00:40:35,029
Thank you.

427
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:55,851
You are aware of the charges
in the indictment against Ernst Janning?

428
00:41:01,692 --> 00:41:03,023
Yes, I am.

429
00:41:04,762 --> 00:41:09,028
Can you honestly say
he is responsible for them?

430
00:41:10,501 --> 00:41:11,866
Yes, I can.

431
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:17,604
Do you consider yourself
free of responsibility?

432
00:41:20,544 --> 00:41:21,875
Yes, I do.

433
00:41:26,684 --> 00:41:30,085
Did you ever swear to the 
Civil Servant Loyalty Oath of 1934?

434
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:32,145
Your Honor, I object.

435
00:41:32,456 --> 00:41:34,686
The witness doesn't have 
to answer that question.

436
00:41:34,758 --> 00:41:36,749
He's not on trial.

437
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:39,486
All Germany is on trial, Your Honor.

438
00:41:39,563 --> 00:41:43,021
This tribunal placed it on trial
when it placed Ernst Janning on trial.

439
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:47,560
If responsibility is to be found,
the widest latitude is to be permitted.

440
00:41:48,472 --> 00:41:50,235
Objection overruled.

441
00:41:51,475 --> 00:41:55,104
Did you ever swear to the 
Civil Servant Loyalty Oath of 1934?

442
00:41:57,882 --> 00:41:59,076
Everyone did.

443
00:41:59,149 --> 00:42:01,879
We are not interested 
in what everyone did.

444
00:42:01,952 --> 00:42:04,284
We are interested in what you did.

445
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:08,724
Would you read the oath from the 
<i>Reich Law Gazette,</i> March, 1933?

446
00:42:09,627 --> 00:42:11,527
"I swear that I shall be obedient...

447
00:42:11,595 --> 00:42:14,621
"to the leader of the German Reich
and people, Adolf Hitler.

448
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:17,758
"That I shall be loyal to him,
that I will observe the laws...

449
00:42:17,835 --> 00:42:20,303
"and that I will conscientiously
fulfill my duties...

450
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:21,929
"so help me God."

451
00:42:22,806 --> 00:42:24,603
Everyone swore to it.

452
00:42:25,976 --> 00:42:27,637
It was mandatory.

453
00:42:29,747 --> 00:42:30,839
Yes.

454
00:42:32,483 --> 00:42:35,418
But you're such a perceptive man, 
Dr. Wieck.

455
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,515
You could see what was coming.

456
00:42:38,589 --> 00:42:42,889
You could see that National Socialism
was leading Germany to disaster.

457
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:46,386
"It was clear to anyone
who had eyes and ears."

458
00:42:48,265 --> 00:42:50,062
Didn't you realize...

459
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:54,761
what it would have meant if you,
and men like you...

460
00:42:55,506 --> 00:42:58,270
would have refused to swear to the oath?

461
00:42:58,776 --> 00:43:03,213
It would have meant that Hitler
could never have come to absolute power.

462
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:07,975
Why didn't you?

463
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:11,178
Why didn't you?

464
00:43:11,889 --> 00:43:14,187
Can you give us an explanation?

465
00:43:15,292 --> 00:43:17,453
Has it something to do with your pension?

466
00:43:17,528 --> 00:43:20,088
Did your pension mean more to you
than your country?

467
00:43:20,164 --> 00:43:21,563
Your Honor!

468
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:26,266
I object to the entire line of questioning,
and ask that it be stricken from the record.

469
00:43:26,337 --> 00:43:29,773
I thought prosecuting counsel
was dedicated to finding responsibility.

470
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:31,774
Your Honor, I made an objection.

471
00:43:31,842 --> 00:43:34,675
Prosecution is not interested
in finding responsibility?

472
00:43:34,745 --> 00:43:38,681
There is responsibility for more here
than swearing to a loyalty oath...

473
00:43:38,749 --> 00:43:40,740
- and you know it.
- There is indeed.

474
00:43:40,818 --> 00:43:44,914
One thing that even the German machine,
with its monumental efficiency...

475
00:43:44,989 --> 00:43:46,581
has been unable to destroy...

476
00:43:46,657 --> 00:43:47,783
Order.

477
00:43:47,858 --> 00:43:51,021
All the victims.
More victims than the world has ever known.

478
00:43:51,095 --> 00:43:54,030
- They will walk into this courtroom--
- Order!

479
00:43:55,499 --> 00:43:59,993
This tribunal will admonish both counsel.
It will tolerate nothing of this kind again.

480
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:03,562
We're not here to listen to outbursts
of this kind, but to serve justice.

481
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:05,404
Your Honor, I made an objection.

482
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:07,376
The objection is overruled.

483
00:44:08,779 --> 00:44:10,679
The witness is excused.

484
00:44:43,747 --> 00:44:45,806
Did you ever read any books by Janning?

485
00:44:45,883 --> 00:44:47,180
No, I don't think so.

486
00:44:47,251 --> 00:44:50,118
- <i>The Meaning of the Law.</i>
- How is it? Interesting?

487
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:53,247
All the books by Janning are interesting.
They're more than that.

488
00:44:53,323 --> 00:44:56,952
They're a picture of an era,
its hopes, its aspirations.

489
00:44:57,094 --> 00:44:59,528
They weren't very different from ours, really.

490
00:44:59,596 --> 00:45:03,225
Listen to this, on the signing
of the Weimar constitution:

491
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:07,327
"Now we can look forward to a Germany
without guns and bloodshed...

492
00:45:07,404 --> 00:45:10,965
"a Germany of justice,
where men can live instead of die...

493
00:45:11,275 --> 00:45:14,335
"a Germany of purpose,
of freedom, of humanity...

494
00:45:14,411 --> 00:45:16,879
"a Germany that calls 
for the best in man."

495
00:45:16,947 --> 00:45:19,438
Now, how could a man
who wrote words like these...

496
00:45:19,516 --> 00:45:22,952
be part of sterilizations and murders?
How could he be?

497
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:26,854
There are a lot of things that happened here
that nobody understands.

498
00:45:26,924 --> 00:45:28,118
I know.

499
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:31,554
But the prosecution will have to prove...

500
00:45:31,628 --> 00:45:32,959
every inch of its allegation...

501
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:36,932
against a man like Janning
if I'm to pronounce sentence on him.

502
00:45:37,367 --> 00:45:40,302
Gentlemen, I'm on my way. 
Coming, Ken?

503
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:41,564
Right.

504
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:45,769
There's just this business
on the curtailment of rights.

505
00:45:46,243 --> 00:45:47,574
Tomorrow.

506
00:45:47,644 --> 00:45:51,637
Dan, my wife is planning a little get-together
tomorrow night at the Grand Hotel.

507
00:45:51,715 --> 00:45:53,546
She wants you to come.

508
00:45:53,617 --> 00:45:54,982
I thank you.

509
00:45:55,052 --> 00:45:59,284
And she'd like to provide you
with some kind of female companionship.

510
00:45:59,389 --> 00:46:01,755
She has a feeling that you 
might be lonely here.

511
00:46:01,825 --> 00:46:03,986
No, thanks, Curtiss. 
Thanks very much.

512
00:46:04,061 --> 00:46:06,723
You know how these wives are.
They love to play Cupid.

513
00:46:06,797 --> 00:46:08,662
I think I'll keep it stag.

514
00:46:08,732 --> 00:46:10,324
All right. 
How about you, Ken?

515
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,960
Thanks. My wife and I
have an engagement. Good night.

516
00:46:13,036 --> 00:46:15,129
- Good night.
- Good night, Dan.

517
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:37,586
Mrs. Halbestadt, could I--

518
00:46:39,663 --> 00:46:40,755
Hello.

519
00:46:42,065 --> 00:46:43,225
Hello.

520
00:46:44,701 --> 00:46:47,226
Your Honor, this is Madame Bertholt.

521
00:46:47,671 --> 00:46:50,071
This is His Honor, Judge Haywood.

522
00:46:51,175 --> 00:46:53,700
Madame Bertholt, this is her house.

523
00:46:54,511 --> 00:46:57,071
She came to get some of her belongings
from the basement.

524
00:46:57,147 --> 00:46:59,115
I didn't know she was coming.

525
00:46:59,183 --> 00:47:01,743
This is my responsibility, Mrs. Halbestadt.

526
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:03,810
I've been storing some of my things here...

527
00:47:03,887 --> 00:47:06,856
until I could get a room large enough
to keep them in.

528
00:47:06,924 --> 00:47:08,323
I hope you don't mind.

529
00:47:08,392 --> 00:47:09,916
No. Not at all.

530
00:47:10,194 --> 00:47:12,719
You can examine what I have here,
if you like.

531
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:14,495
Of course not.

532
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:16,459
Then I'll just take these out.

533
00:47:16,533 --> 00:47:18,228
- Here.
- Thanks, Mrs. Halbestadt.

534
00:47:18,302 --> 00:47:20,395
- Let me help you.
- No. I can manage all right.

535
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:21,960
I'll take these outside. Please.

536
00:47:22,039 --> 00:47:23,336
Good night.

537
00:47:37,387 --> 00:47:39,719
It's heavy. 
It's full of books and pictures...

538
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:42,623
things that mean nothing to anyone but me.

539
00:47:42,726 --> 00:47:44,717
- Mr. Schmidt?
- Your Honor.

540
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:48,996
Would you drive
Mrs. Bertholt home, please?

541
00:47:49,066 --> 00:47:50,556
Yes, Your Honor.

542
00:47:50,634 --> 00:47:53,432
- I hope you're comfortable here.
- Yes, I am. Very.

543
00:47:53,503 --> 00:47:55,903
My favorite spot was always the garden.

544
00:47:55,973 --> 00:47:59,067
Remind Mr. Halbestadt to take 
good care of the rock garden.

545
00:47:59,142 --> 00:48:02,373
You'll get a great deal of pleasure 
out of it in summer.

546
00:48:02,446 --> 00:48:04,641
I'll sit in front, thank you.

547
00:48:06,783 --> 00:48:08,478
- Good night.
- Good night.

548
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:11,419
- Karolinenstrasse 115, please.
- Yes, madam.

549
00:48:32,009 --> 00:48:33,271
Sit down.

550
00:48:37,314 --> 00:48:40,772
You worked for Mrs. Bertholt, didn't you?

551
00:48:40,851 --> 00:48:42,443
Yes, Your Honor.

552
00:48:42,619 --> 00:48:44,712
How long did she live here?

553
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:46,514
Madame Bertholt?

554
00:48:47,524 --> 00:48:52,359
Madame Bertholt and her family have lived here 
for many generations, Your Honor.

555
00:48:52,696 --> 00:48:54,027
Thank you.

556
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:58,599
Your Honor, you came in here for something?

557
00:49:00,203 --> 00:49:02,831
I was just going to make myself a sandwich.

558
00:49:03,006 --> 00:49:04,564
- We will make it for you.
- No.

559
00:49:04,641 --> 00:49:07,109
- We will make anything you want.
- No. It's nothing.

560
00:49:07,177 --> 00:49:09,145
I always used to do it for myself back home.

561
00:49:09,212 --> 00:49:13,046
What would you like? 
I have some ham and cheese and liverwurst.

562
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:15,581
Cheese will be fine.

563
00:49:17,321 --> 00:49:19,312
That's very kind of you.

564
00:49:28,665 --> 00:49:32,066
What was it like,
living under National Socialism?

565
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:35,598
What was it like?

566
00:49:35,872 --> 00:49:38,864
Yes. I mean, day to day?

567
00:49:39,543 --> 00:49:42,137
You know, I know many people at home like you.

568
00:49:42,212 --> 00:49:44,703
You're good people. 
I believe that.

569
00:49:46,383 --> 00:49:49,181
What was it like for you, 
living under Hitler?

570
00:49:49,252 --> 00:49:53,086
We were not political.
Mr. Halbestadt and I are not political.

571
00:49:55,892 --> 00:49:57,257
No, but...

572
00:49:57,828 --> 00:50:02,094
you must have been aware of some
of the events that were going on.

573
00:50:04,134 --> 00:50:06,568
Many things were going on.

574
00:50:06,636 --> 00:50:08,467
There were parades.

575
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:12,838
Hitler and Goebbels came here every year.

576
00:50:14,411 --> 00:50:16,072
What was it like?

577
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:19,812
We never attended meetings. 
Never.

578
00:50:20,984 --> 00:50:23,043
I'm not trying to put you on trial.

579
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:26,146
I'm just curious. 
I'd like to know.

580
00:50:27,557 --> 00:50:30,492
- Here's your sandwich, Your Honor.
- Thank you.

581
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:32,084
You're welcome.

582
00:50:32,596 --> 00:50:33,961
Thank you.

583
00:50:37,267 --> 00:50:39,701
For instance, there was 
a place called Dachau...

584
00:50:39,770 --> 00:50:42,466
which was not too many miles from here.

585
00:50:42,639 --> 00:50:45,437
Did you ever know
what was going on there?

586
00:50:46,343 --> 00:50:49,335
We knew nothing about it.

587
00:50:51,481 --> 00:50:55,975
How can you ask
if we knew anything about that?

588
00:50:58,055 --> 00:50:59,386
I'm sorry.

589
00:51:01,792 --> 00:51:05,250
Your Honor, we are only little people.

590
00:51:06,763 --> 00:51:08,890
We lost a son in the army...

591
00:51:10,467 --> 00:51:12,833
and our daughter in the bombing.

592
00:51:14,671 --> 00:51:17,299
During the war we almost starved.

593
00:51:18,642 --> 00:51:20,542
It was terrible for us.

594
00:51:22,245 --> 00:51:23,837
I'm sure it was.

595
00:51:27,784 --> 00:51:29,911
Hitler did some good things.

596
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:33,921
I won't say he didn't do 
some good things.

597
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:36,790
He built the <i>Autobahn.</i>

598
00:51:37,461 --> 00:51:39,452
He gave more people work.

599
00:51:40,297 --> 00:51:43,130
We won't say he didn't do 
some good things.

600
00:51:45,035 --> 00:51:47,162
But the other things...

601
00:51:48,405 --> 00:51:51,238
the things they say he did 
to the Jews and the rest...

602
00:51:51,308 --> 00:51:53,401
we knew nothing about that.

603
00:51:53,643 --> 00:51:55,474
Very few Germans did.

604
00:51:57,647 --> 00:51:59,979
And if we did know...

605
00:52:01,718 --> 00:52:03,379
what could we do?

606
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:06,818
But Mrs. Halbestadt said 
you didn't know.

607
00:52:12,429 --> 00:52:15,830
Mrs. Bertholt. 
How did she react to all this?

608
00:52:16,633 --> 00:52:20,364
Madame Bertholt is a very fine woman,
Your Honor.

609
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:23,266
I'm sure she is. 
What about her husband?

610
00:52:25,342 --> 00:52:27,071
He was in the army.

611
00:52:27,911 --> 00:52:29,708
What happened to him?

612
00:52:31,148 --> 00:52:35,312
He was one of the defendants
in the Malmedy Case.

613
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:42,451
General Bertholt. Karl Bertholt.

614
00:52:44,261 --> 00:52:46,388
He was executed, Your Honor.

615
00:52:48,798 --> 00:52:50,425
Yes, I know that.

616
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:57,936
The document then states that
the photographer, Rudolf Lenz...

617
00:52:58,008 --> 00:53:00,374
is requested to present himself
within two weeks...

618
00:53:00,443 --> 00:53:03,139
at one the hospitals mentioned below...

619
00:53:03,547 --> 00:53:06,141
for medical treatment.

620
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:10,742
Next, prosecution presents
affidavit document no. 488...

621
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:13,687
which concerns the seamstress,
Anni Meunch.

622
00:53:13,757 --> 00:53:15,782
Document reads as follows:

623
00:53:15,992 --> 00:53:19,223
"District Court, Frankfurt am Main,
has decided the following:

624
00:53:19,296 --> 00:53:22,060
"The seamstress, Anni Meunch,
daughter of Wilhelm Meunch...

625
00:53:22,132 --> 00:53:23,724
"is to be sterilized.

626
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:26,860
"She is therefore requested
to present herself within two weeks...

627
00:53:26,937 --> 00:53:29,428
"at one of the hospitals mentioned below.

628
00:53:29,506 --> 00:53:31,838
"If she does not take herself voluntarily...

629
00:53:31,908 --> 00:53:34,103
"she will be taken by force."

630
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:37,510
Next, document no. 449...

631
00:53:37,614 --> 00:53:40,811
interrogatories in the 
German and English text...

632
00:53:41,117 --> 00:53:43,551
concerning the farmer's helper,
Meyer Eichinger.

633
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:45,087
Your Honor...

634
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:52,692
defense objects to introduction
of these repetitive documents.

635
00:53:52,762 --> 00:53:55,526
According to the ruling
of the first tribunal...

636
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:58,033
such documents are not even admissible...

637
00:53:58,101 --> 00:54:02,003
unless supported by independent evidence
of their authenticity.

638
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:05,169
Objection sustained.

639
00:54:06,576 --> 00:54:09,909
Your Honor,
may I ask the defense a question?

640
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:11,038
Yes.

641
00:54:11,381 --> 00:54:15,647
Would evidence on sterilization
be admissible if there were a witness?

642
00:54:26,029 --> 00:54:27,860
- Yes.
- Thank you.

643
00:54:29,165 --> 00:54:32,259
Prosecution calls the witness,
Rudolph Petersen.

644
00:54:56,793 --> 00:54:59,091
Will you raise your right hand?

645
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:01,396
I swear by God,
the Almighty and Omniscient...

646
00:55:01,464 --> 00:55:05,332
that I will speak the pure truth
and withhold and add nothing.

647
00:55:05,402 --> 00:55:06,767
I do.

648
00:55:23,887 --> 00:55:28,153
Will you please tell the court 
your full name and place of residence?

649
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:33,122
Rudolph Petersen.
Frankfurt am Main, Gratweg <i>Nummer 7.</i>

650
00:55:34,464 --> 00:55:36,932
When were you born, Mr. Petersen?

651
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,491
May 20, 1914.

652
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:42,397
And what is your occupation?

653
00:55:43,106 --> 00:55:45,700
I'm a baker's helper.

654
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:49,706
Are your parents living?

655
00:55:50,413 --> 00:55:51,437
No.

656
00:55:52,482 --> 00:55:55,076
What were the causes of their deaths?

657
00:55:59,322 --> 00:56:02,758
Mr. Petersen, did they die of natural causes?

658
00:56:03,259 --> 00:56:05,284
Yeah, natural.

659
00:56:09,132 --> 00:56:12,568
What political party
did your father belong to?

660
00:56:12,635 --> 00:56:15,763
The Communist Party.

661
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:21,737
Now think back.

662
00:56:21,878 --> 00:56:24,574
Do you remember anything unusual...

663
00:56:24,748 --> 00:56:27,842
that happened to you 
and your family in 1933...

664
00:56:28,585 --> 00:56:30,883
before the Nazis came to power?

665
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:34,246
I mean, anything of a violent nature.

666
00:56:35,692 --> 00:56:36,818
Yeah.

667
00:56:37,827 --> 00:56:39,920
How old were you at the time?

668
00:56:39,996 --> 00:56:41,258
Nineteen.

669
00:56:42,098 --> 00:56:45,090
Would you please tell the court
what happened?

670
00:56:49,172 --> 00:56:52,938
Some SA men broke into our house...

671
00:56:55,378 --> 00:56:58,245
and they broke the windows and the door...

672
00:56:59,015 --> 00:57:01,176
and they called us traitors...

673
00:57:02,152 --> 00:57:06,953
and they tried to beat up my father.

674
00:57:07,991 --> 00:57:09,891
What happened then?

675
00:57:10,126 --> 00:57:13,323
My brothers and I, 
we went to help him.

676
00:57:14,531 --> 00:57:16,931
And there was a fight...

677
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:21,127
and finally we got them outside
in the street...

678
00:57:21,204 --> 00:57:23,001
and we beat them up...

679
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:26,531
and turned them over to the police.

680
00:57:27,477 --> 00:57:30,002
Did the police do anything about it?

681
00:57:30,146 --> 00:57:31,636
- No.
- Why not?

682
00:57:32,215 --> 00:57:33,682
It was then...

683
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:37,584
at the time of the national elections.

684
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:41,447
You mean the time 
the National Socialists came to power?

685
00:57:41,524 --> 00:57:42,513
Yeah.

686
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:48,594
What happened after 1933...

687
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:51,563
after the Nazis came to power?

688
00:57:52,235 --> 00:57:54,726
I got a job on a farm...

689
00:57:55,505 --> 00:57:59,737
but for the work,
to drive a truck was necessary.

690
00:58:00,777 --> 00:58:05,043
I went to the city building
to apply for a license.

691
00:58:05,448 --> 00:58:07,416
And what happened there?

692
00:58:08,084 --> 00:58:10,848
They took me to an official.

693
00:58:12,822 --> 00:58:16,417
Did you ever have any dealings
with this official before?

694
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:19,794
He was one of the men...

695
00:58:21,297 --> 00:58:23,857
who broke into our house that night.

696
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:26,625
What did he say to your application?

697
00:58:28,037 --> 00:58:31,598
He said an examination
there would have to be.

698
00:58:32,609 --> 00:58:35,339
Where was the examination to take place?

699
00:58:35,845 --> 00:58:38,473
In the district court of Stuttgart.

700
00:58:39,716 --> 00:58:42,549
Who was the presiding justice in the court?

701
00:58:46,222 --> 00:58:47,985
Justice Hoffstetter.

702
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:52,684
What happened in the courtroom?

703
00:58:53,830 --> 00:58:57,425
They asked me my full name...

704
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:59,559
and so forth.

705
00:59:00,236 --> 00:59:02,363
What else did they ask you?

706
00:59:03,406 --> 00:59:08,070
They asked me when Adolf Hitler
and Dr. Goebbels were born.

707
00:59:09,479 --> 00:59:11,208
What did you reply?

708
00:59:12,115 --> 00:59:17,075
I told them I didn't know,
and also that I didn't care.

709
00:59:23,459 --> 00:59:26,223
Did they ask you any more questions?

710
00:59:27,030 --> 00:59:31,091
No. They told me that
I would be hearing from them in ten days.

711
00:59:31,901 --> 00:59:34,927
I see. Now, Mr. Petersen...

712
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:39,408
I'd like you to look at something.

713
00:59:52,355 --> 00:59:54,118
Do you recognize it?

714
00:59:54,691 --> 00:59:55,715
Yeah.

715
00:59:55,792 --> 00:59:58,590
Would you please read it for the tribunal?

716
01:00:00,897 --> 01:00:03,923
"District Court of Stuttgart.

717
01:00:04,968 --> 01:00:08,870
"The baker, Rudolph Petersen,
born May 20, 1914...

01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:13,440
"son of railway employee, 
Hans Petersen...

719
01:00:17,647 --> 01:00:19,478
"is to be sterilized."

720
01:00:20,550 --> 01:00:23,212
Now would you read the last paragraph?

721
01:00:27,957 --> 01:00:31,085
"It is therefore requested...

722
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:34,391
"he present himself within two weeks...

723
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:37,789

"betake himself voluntarily...

726
01:00:48,144 --> 01:00:50,305
"he will be taken by force."

727
01:00:54,584 --> 01:00:57,485
Please read the signature at the bottom.

728
01:01:00,556 --> 01:01:03,389
"Presiding Justice Hoffstetter."

729
01:01:07,463 --> 01:01:10,728
Would you read what is written 
below the signature?

730
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:13,158
- Below?
- Below.

731
01:01:14,871 --> 01:01:17,431
"By authority of...

732
01:01:18,541 --> 01:01:20,509
"Ernst Janning...

733
01:01:21,944 --> 01:01:23,844
"Minister of Justice."

734
01:01:27,083 --> 01:01:28,573
Your Honor...

735
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:34,289
may the defense see the file
of Mr. Petersen?

736
01:01:35,892 --> 01:01:39,623
What did you do after you 
received the letter, Mr. Petersen?

737
01:01:39,729 --> 01:01:41,094
I ran away.

738
01:01:41,297 --> 01:01:44,494
I stayed at the farm 
of a friend I have.

739
01:01:45,234 --> 01:01:46,963
And did you return?

740
01:01:48,337 --> 01:01:50,464
- Did I what?
- Did you return?

741
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:51,932
Yes.

742
01:01:52,408 --> 01:01:54,308
And what happened then?

743
01:01:55,645 --> 01:01:57,237
The police came.

744
01:01:59,949 --> 01:02:01,917
Where did they take you?

745
01:02:03,820 --> 01:02:05,412
To the hospital.

746
01:02:06,622 --> 01:02:08,817
Mr. Petersen, excuse me.

747
01:02:08,891 --> 01:02:12,224
I wonder if you could speak
a little louder, please.

748
01:02:13,096 --> 01:02:14,688
To the hospital.

749
01:02:15,231 --> 01:02:17,665
And what happened at the hospital?

750
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:19,529
They kept me there.

751
01:02:20,303 --> 01:02:23,238
The nurse who was...

752
01:02:25,441 --> 01:02:27,466
Well, she came in, anyway.

753
01:02:27,944 --> 01:02:30,674
She was to prepare me for the operation.

754
01:02:30,913 --> 01:02:35,441
And she said she thought 
the whole thing was terrible.

755
01:02:38,654 --> 01:02:42,954
Then the doctor came in
who was supposed to do the...

756
01:02:45,128 --> 01:02:48,461
And he said he thought it was awful.

757
01:02:50,399 --> 01:02:53,391
Were you, in fact, sterilized?

758
01:03:02,512 --> 01:03:04,946
Thank you very much, Mr. Petersen.

759
01:03:06,482 --> 01:03:07,881
That's all.

760
01:03:10,086 --> 01:03:11,485
<i>Herr</i> Rolfe?

761
01:03:22,098 --> 01:03:23,656
Mr. Petersen...

762
01:03:25,735 --> 01:03:29,193
you may take your earphones off now,
if you want to.

763
01:03:37,814 --> 01:03:41,511
You say you work as a baker's helper?
Is that correct?

764
01:03:41,584 --> 01:03:43,245
Yes, that is right.

765
01:03:45,221 --> 01:03:47,781
What other occupations have you held?

766
01:03:47,857 --> 01:03:50,087
I have worked for my father.

767
01:03:51,294 --> 01:03:53,262
What did your father do?

768
01:03:53,930 --> 01:03:55,921
He was a railroad worker.

769
01:03:56,332 --> 01:03:58,596
Yes, but what did he do?

770
01:03:59,402 --> 01:04:04,135
He would raise and lower the barrier...

771
01:04:05,474 --> 01:04:08,034
at the crossing, for traffic.

772
01:04:11,747 --> 01:04:16,377
And you spoke about your brothers.
How many brothers do you have?

773
01:04:17,486 --> 01:04:18,578
Five.

774
01:04:18,921 --> 01:04:20,320
And sisters?

775
01:04:20,723 --> 01:04:21,815
Four.

776
01:04:21,924 --> 01:04:24,415
- Then you are a family of ten?
- Yes.

777
01:04:27,129 --> 01:04:29,825
What occupations do your brothers have?

778
01:04:30,233 --> 01:04:31,495
Laborers.

779
01:04:32,702 --> 01:04:35,637
All laborers? I see.

780
01:04:39,141 --> 01:04:42,269
You said the court at Stuttgart
asked you two questions:

781
01:04:42,345 --> 01:04:45,906
The birth dates of Hitler and Dr. Goebbels.
Is that correct?

782
01:04:45,982 --> 01:04:47,449
Yes, correct.

783
01:04:47,783 --> 01:04:49,876
What else did they ask you?

784
01:04:52,588 --> 01:04:54,055
Nothing else.

785
01:04:55,458 --> 01:04:56,925
Are you sure?

786
01:04:57,560 --> 01:05:00,688
Are you sure there were no questions
about your schooling?

787
01:05:00,763 --> 01:05:02,094
Objection!

788
01:05:02,965 --> 01:05:06,423
The witness has already 
answered that question.

789
01:05:10,139 --> 01:05:11,902
Objection sustained.

790
01:05:17,246 --> 01:05:18,838
May I ask you...

791
01:05:29,558 --> 01:05:31,958
how long did you attend school?

792
01:05:32,328 --> 01:05:33,522
Six years.

793
01:05:33,596 --> 01:05:36,064
Six years? Why not longer?

794
01:05:38,034 --> 01:05:39,797
I had to go to work.

795
01:05:40,469 --> 01:05:44,166
Would you consider yourself
a very bright fellow at school?

796
01:05:45,508 --> 01:05:47,271
School?

797
01:05:48,945 --> 01:05:51,140
It was a long while ago. 
I don't--

798
01:05:52,515 --> 01:05:55,643
Perhaps you were not able 
to keep up with the others...

799
01:05:55,718 --> 01:05:57,948
and that's why you did not continue?

800
01:05:58,020 --> 01:05:59,885
Objection, Your Honor.

801
01:06:00,289 --> 01:06:03,725
The witness' school record has 
nothing to do with what happened to him.

802
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:08,287
It was the task of the Health Court
to sterilize the mentally incompetent.

803
01:06:12,401 --> 01:06:14,198
Objection overruled.

804
01:06:20,443 --> 01:06:24,209
Were you able, 
or were you not able...

805
01:06:25,014 --> 01:06:27,141
to keep up with the others?

806
01:06:32,655 --> 01:06:37,149
I would like to refer to the efficiency report
made at the school about Mr. Petersen.

807
01:06:37,226 --> 01:06:41,629
He failed to be promoted, and was placed 
in a class of backward children.

808
01:06:46,469 --> 01:06:49,927
You say your parents 
died of natural causes.

809
01:06:50,373 --> 01:06:51,431
Yes.

810
01:06:51,807 --> 01:06:55,538
Would you describe in detail
the illness your mother died of?

811
01:06:55,611 --> 01:06:57,476
She died of her heart.

812
01:06:58,647 --> 01:07:01,275
In the last stages of her illness,
did your mother...

813
01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:05,719
show any mental peculiarities?

814
01:07:07,857 --> 01:07:09,449
No.

815
01:07:11,093 --> 01:07:13,391
In the decision that came down from Stuttgart...

816
01:07:13,462 --> 01:07:17,193
it is stated that your mother suffered
from hereditary feeble-mindedness.

817
01:07:19,135 --> 01:07:21,365
That is not true!

818
01:07:23,472 --> 01:07:25,167
Can you give us some clarification...

819
01:07:25,241 --> 01:07:29,871
as to how the Hereditary Health Court
in Stuttgart arrived at that decision?

820
01:07:30,146 --> 01:07:35,106
It was just something they said
to put me on the operating table.

821
01:07:35,284 --> 01:07:37,878
- It was just something they said?
- Yes.

822
01:07:38,721 --> 01:07:42,748
Mr. Petersen, there was a simple test...

823
01:07:43,959 --> 01:07:48,259
that the Health Court used to ask
in all cases of mental incompetence.

824
01:07:48,731 --> 01:07:51,427
Since you say they did not ask you then...

825
01:07:51,901 --> 01:07:54,597
perhaps you can answer it for us now.

826
01:07:54,770 --> 01:07:58,536
Form a sentence out of the words
"Hare," "Hunter," "Field."

827
01:07:58,607 --> 01:08:00,472
Your Honor, objection.

828
01:08:09,151 --> 01:08:13,417
Was the court in Stuttgart
constituted like this one?

829
01:08:14,857 --> 01:08:17,348
I don't understand what--

830
01:08:17,860 --> 01:08:19,725
Was there an audience?

831
01:08:20,830 --> 01:08:22,525
An audience? Yes.

832
01:08:23,833 --> 01:08:25,198
Thank you.

833
01:08:28,370 --> 01:08:30,133
Objection overruled.

834
01:08:32,241 --> 01:08:36,735
"Hare," "Hunter," "Field."

835
01:08:40,783 --> 01:08:42,341
Take your time.

836
01:08:56,699 --> 01:08:59,361
They had already made up--

837
01:09:00,436 --> 01:09:03,963
When I walked into the court,
they had made up their minds.

838
01:09:07,009 --> 01:09:10,376
They put me in the hospital, 
like a criminal.

839
01:09:10,446 --> 01:09:13,677
I could not say anything.
I could not do anything.

840
01:09:16,752 --> 01:09:18,515
I had to lay there.

841
01:09:21,323 --> 01:09:23,757
My mother...

842
01:09:25,394 --> 01:09:27,328
what you say about her... 

843
01:09:27,396 --> 01:09:31,355
She was a woman,
a servant woman who worked hard.

844
01:09:31,433 --> 01:09:33,367
She was a hardworking woman...

845
01:09:33,435 --> 01:09:36,996
and it is not fair what you say.

846
01:09:43,112 --> 01:09:44,204
Here.

847
01:09:46,348 --> 01:09:50,444
I want to show you. 
I have here her picture.

848
01:09:51,453 --> 01:09:53,751
I would like you to look at it.

849
01:10:05,434 --> 01:10:07,732
I would like you to judge.

850
01:10:09,672 --> 01:10:13,699
I want that you tell me...

851
01:10:14,176 --> 01:10:16,736
was she feeble-minded?

852
01:10:18,247 --> 01:10:19,874
My mother!

853
01:10:21,650 --> 01:10:23,550
Was she feeble-minded?

854
01:10:26,589 --> 01:10:27,851
Was she?

855
01:10:38,167 --> 01:10:41,500
I feel it is my duty
to point out to the tribunal...

856
01:10:42,438 --> 01:10:46,135
that the witness is not in control
of his mental processes.

857
01:10:46,809 --> 01:10:50,575
I know I am not. 
Since that day.

858
01:10:52,081 --> 01:10:55,778
I've been half I've ever been.

859
01:11:03,559 --> 01:11:06,619
The tribunal does not know
how you were before.

860
01:11:07,696 --> 01:11:09,391
It can never know.

861
01:11:10,933 --> 01:11:12,833
It has only your word.

862
01:11:34,223 --> 01:11:35,952
Court is adjourned.

863
01:11:48,537 --> 01:11:51,131
That's one problem we have
with the prosecution.

864
01:11:51,206 --> 01:11:54,107
It's filled with young radicals like Lawson.

865
01:11:54,476 --> 01:11:56,876
Is that what Lawson is? 
A young radical?

866
01:11:56,945 --> 01:11:59,709
He was a personal protégé of FDR.

867
01:12:00,015 --> 01:12:03,246
FDR had a few friends who weren't radicals,
didn't he?

868
01:12:03,319 --> 01:12:04,581
Name one.

869
01:12:05,921 --> 01:12:07,548
Wendell Wilkie.

870
01:12:08,824 --> 01:12:11,292
Is he your idea of a conservative?

871
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:15,760
As a matter of fact, Dan,
I've been wondering how you stand.

872
01:12:16,165 --> 01:12:20,568
I'll clarify that for you, Curtiss.
I'm a rock-ribbed Republican...

873
01:12:20,736 --> 01:12:24,035
who thought that Franklin Roosevelt
was a great man.

874
01:12:24,907 --> 01:12:26,397
One of those?

875
01:12:29,578 --> 01:12:30,670
Max!

876
01:12:31,513 --> 01:12:34,448
- Max Perkins. You know him?
- No, I don't think so.

877
01:12:34,516 --> 01:12:36,643
He's with the United Press.

878
01:12:40,522 --> 01:12:42,319
Max, what are you doing here?

879
01:12:42,391 --> 01:12:44,586
I thought you might kick up 
a row or something.

880
01:12:44,660 --> 01:12:47,060
I haven't had that much to drink.

881
01:12:47,429 --> 01:12:49,488
- I'm sorry, this is Judge Ives.
- Hello.

882
01:12:49,565 --> 01:12:51,658
- Mrs. Ives.
- How do you do?

883
01:12:51,734 --> 01:12:53,827
- How do you do?
- Judge Haywood, Mrs. Bertholt.

884
01:12:53,902 --> 01:12:56,029
- We have met.
- Yes, we have.

885
01:12:56,372 --> 01:12:58,431
Won't you join us for a drink?

886
01:12:58,507 --> 01:13:00,304
We would like to very much.

887
01:13:00,376 --> 01:13:02,867
- Max, will you sit here?
- Thank you.

888
01:13:03,212 --> 01:13:07,444
Incidentally, Max, I admired your article
on Mrs. Bertholt very much.

889
01:13:07,516 --> 01:13:09,108
It was straight reporting.

890
01:13:09,184 --> 01:13:11,709
Her defense of her husband
was quite eloquent.

891
01:13:11,787 --> 01:13:14,688
Are you going to do a story 
on these trials?

892
01:13:14,757 --> 01:13:16,850
I'll tell you something frankly, Judge.

893
01:13:16,925 --> 01:13:20,827
At the moment, I couldn't give a story away
on the Nuremberg Trials.

894
01:13:20,896 --> 01:13:22,488
What do you mean, Mr. Perkins?

895
01:13:22,564 --> 01:13:25,055
The American public
just isn't interested anymore.

896
01:13:25,134 --> 01:13:28,399
But the war's only been over
two years, Mr. Perkins.

897
01:13:28,470 --> 01:13:29,903
That's right.

898
01:13:29,972 --> 01:13:32,941
- May I take your order?
- Yes. See what the ladies will have.

899
01:13:33,008 --> 01:13:34,270
How about some more beer, Dan?

900
01:13:34,343 --> 01:13:38,712
No. I think I've had my fill of beer.
I'd like to try something else, if I may.

901
01:13:38,781 --> 01:13:43,184
Why don't you try some Sonnenberg, 
or Schwalbenwinkel? It's the local wine.

902
01:13:43,252 --> 01:13:46,085
- Sonnenberg or... 
- Schwalbenwinkel.

903
01:13:46,388 --> 01:13:49,789
Yes, I think I'd like that.
Some Schweissenwinkel.

904
01:13:50,325 --> 01:13:53,260
- Will you have some?
- Yes, thank you. I'll have the same.

905
01:13:53,328 --> 01:13:55,660
- Should we stay with the beer, Max?
- Fine.

906
01:13:55,731 --> 01:13:57,494
Thank you.

907
01:13:57,566 --> 01:14:00,933
- You got home all right the other night?
- Yes, thank you.

908
01:14:01,003 --> 01:14:04,336
I don't know what I would have done
without the car.

909
01:14:04,940 --> 01:14:07,807
You speak English very well, Mrs. Bertholt.

910
01:14:07,910 --> 01:14:11,539
Thank you. My husband and I
spent three years in America.

911
01:14:15,217 --> 01:14:18,414
I hope you had a chance
to see something of Nuremberg.

912
01:14:19,421 --> 01:14:24,324
I'm afraid mainly the road between 
my house and the Palace of Justice.

913
01:14:24,827 --> 01:14:29,389
And then some places that have to do
with the case, the historical aspects.

914
01:14:29,598 --> 01:14:31,225
The Nazi aspects.

915
01:14:31,900 --> 01:14:34,494
You should see some of the 
other parts of Nuremberg.

916
01:14:34,570 --> 01:14:37,562
There are many beautiful things to see
in the old part of town.

917
01:14:37,639 --> 01:14:39,869
Museums we're trying to rebuild.

918
01:14:39,942 --> 01:14:44,311
And there's a concert, a piano concert
next week at the old opera house.

919
01:14:44,379 --> 01:14:48,611
Arthur Reiss. 
He was a refugee from Hitler in the early days.

920
01:14:49,418 --> 01:14:51,045
We've persuaded him to come back.

921
01:14:51,119 --> 01:14:54,646
It ought to be quite an evening.
Would you like to come?

922
01:14:54,990 --> 01:14:56,514
Yes, I would.

923
01:14:57,359 --> 01:15:01,318
I'll tell them to leave a ticket for you
at the box office. I'm on the committee.

924
01:15:01,396 --> 01:15:04,229
- Thank you very much, Mrs. Bertholt.
- It's nothing.

925
01:15:04,299 --> 01:15:08,258
You see, I have a mission with the Americans, 
as Mr. Perkins can tell you.

926
01:15:08,337 --> 01:15:09,964
What is that?

927
01:15:10,906 --> 01:15:13,841
To convince you that 
we're not all monsters.

928
01:15:17,813 --> 01:15:19,474
- Good evening, Colonel.
- Good evening.

929
01:15:19,548 --> 01:15:21,482
Colonel. Maj. Radnitz.

930
01:15:21,717 --> 01:15:23,844
Good evening, Mrs. Bertholt.

931
01:15:27,122 --> 01:15:28,521
I hope you'll excuse me.

932
01:15:28,590 --> 01:15:29,955
But you've just come--

933
01:15:30,025 --> 01:15:33,392
No, I must go. Please excuse me.
It was awfully nice meeting you.

934
01:15:33,462 --> 01:15:37,296
If you want to hear the concert,
there'll be a ticket for you at the box office.

935
01:15:37,366 --> 01:15:39,095
- Thank you.
- Good night.

936
01:15:39,167 --> 01:15:41,635
- Good night.
- Good night, Mrs. Bertholt.

937
01:15:47,809 --> 01:15:52,246
Mrs. Bertholt doesn't hold
a burning passion for me.

938
01:15:53,482 --> 01:15:55,712
I prosecuted her husband.

939
01:15:57,519 --> 01:16:00,044
There are many people
who think a death sentence...

940
01:16:00,122 --> 01:16:02,955
would not have been passed
against Gen. Bertholt today.

941
01:16:03,025 --> 01:16:04,890
I'm sure there are.

942
01:16:05,494 --> 01:16:07,519
I'm sure there are people who think...

943
01:16:07,596 --> 01:16:10,963
all the prisoners in Nuremberg
should be free today.

944
01:16:11,033 --> 01:16:12,796
All of them. Let--

945
01:16:14,169 --> 01:16:15,864
Excuse me.

946
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:20,167
I've had one or two too many...

947
01:16:20,242 --> 01:16:23,177
as might be painfully obvious
to you gentlemen.

948
01:16:23,579 --> 01:16:28,175
The spectacle this afternoon with Mr. Petersen 
put me off my feed. I'm sorry.

949
01:16:28,250 --> 01:16:32,380
Three beers and Schwalbenwinkel, please.

950
01:16:38,994 --> 01:16:40,359
Schwalbenwinkel.

951
01:16:42,764 --> 01:16:46,325
It's good beer.
They make it good in this country.

952
01:16:49,204 --> 01:16:52,503
You know, there's one thing
about Americans.

953
01:16:53,642 --> 01:16:56,076
We're not cut out to be occupiers.

954
01:16:56,211 --> 01:16:59,146
We're new at it. 
We're not very good at it.

955
01:16:59,348 --> 01:17:02,215
We come over here, 
and what do we see?

956
01:17:03,218 --> 01:17:05,550
We see this beautiful country.

957
01:17:05,754 --> 01:17:08,348
It is beautiful. 
It's very beautiful.

958
01:17:08,890 --> 01:17:12,155
We see the culture that goes back
for hundreds of years.

959
01:17:12,227 --> 01:17:14,559
We see its <i>gemütlich</i> charm...

960
01:17:15,163 --> 01:17:18,724
and the charm of people 
like Mrs. Bertholt.

961
01:17:20,135 --> 01:17:23,036
We've got a built-in inferiority complex.

962
01:17:23,105 --> 01:17:25,232
We forgive and forget easy.

963
01:17:25,874 --> 01:17:28,069
We give the other guy
the benefit of the doubt.

964
01:17:28,143 --> 01:17:30,111
That's the American way.

965
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:35,811
We beat the greatest war machine
since Alexander the Great.

966
01:17:37,285 --> 01:17:39,685
And now the boy scouts take over.

967
01:17:41,223 --> 01:17:44,818
The trouble with you, Colonel,
is you'd like to indict the whole country.

968
01:17:44,893 --> 01:17:47,953
That might be emotionally satisfying to you...

969
01:17:48,030 --> 01:17:51,466
but it wouldn't be exactly practical,
and hardly fair.

970
01:17:52,467 --> 01:17:53,866
Hardly fair?

971
01:17:57,172 --> 01:17:58,400
"Hare."

972
01:17:59,474 --> 01:18:00,771
"Hunter."

973
01:18:02,110 --> 01:18:03,372
"Field."

974
01:18:04,980 --> 01:18:07,141
That's right, let's be fair.

975
01:18:08,116 --> 01:18:11,176
"The hare was shot by the hunter
in the field."

976
01:18:11,953 --> 01:18:13,944
It's really quite simple.

977
01:18:17,292 --> 01:18:20,420
Colonel, I think we ought to be going.

978
01:18:21,129 --> 01:18:23,563
Yes, we really shouldn't be discussing this.

979
01:18:23,632 --> 01:18:27,295
No, Judge.
We're fair Americans, and true-blue.

980
01:18:27,369 --> 01:18:29,303
We mustn't do anything that's out of order.

981
01:18:29,371 --> 01:18:32,568
No, sir. We can't do anything
that's out of order.

982
01:18:36,278 --> 01:18:39,975
There are no Nazis in Germany.
Didn't you know that, Judge?

983
01:18:40,782 --> 01:18:43,842
The Eskimos invaded Germany
and took over.

984
01:18:43,919 --> 01:18:46,547
That's how all those terrible things happened.

985
01:18:46,621 --> 01:18:51,217
It wasn't the fault of the Germans.
It was the fault of those damn Eskimos.

986
01:18:53,795 --> 01:18:55,160
Excuse me.

987
01:18:56,698 --> 01:18:59,030
- Good night, Colonel.
- Good night.

988
01:19:13,648 --> 01:19:17,084
Can I have your attention, please?
I'm sorry to interrupt your dancing.

989
01:19:17,152 --> 01:19:20,986
The following officers
are requested to report to their units.

990
01:19:21,256 --> 01:19:26,125
Maj. McCarthy, Maj. Citron,
Maj. Cantor, Capt. Byers...

991
01:19:26,461 --> 01:19:29,988
Capt. Connell, Capt. Douglas, Capt. Wolfe...

992
01:19:30,365 --> 01:19:32,833
Maj. Booth, and Maj. Rice.

993
01:19:33,568 --> 01:19:36,128
Thank you. 
You can continue dancing.

994
01:19:39,407 --> 01:19:41,102
Harry, what is it?

995
01:19:41,777 --> 01:19:44,177
The Russians have made their move
in Czechoslovakia.

996
01:19:44,246 --> 01:19:47,340
It's rumored Masaryk committed suicide.
We're sending units up.

997
01:19:47,415 --> 01:19:49,474
What do you think's going to happen?

998
01:19:49,551 --> 01:19:51,018
I don't know.

999
01:19:54,556 --> 01:19:56,148
Judge Haywood... 

1000
01:19:58,260 --> 01:19:59,818
Elsa Scheffler.

1001
01:20:08,537 --> 01:20:10,801
"President Truman responded to the crisis...

1002
01:20:10,872 --> 01:20:13,500
"by calling for an extension
of military training.

1003
01:20:13,675 --> 01:20:18,374
"He stated that he is deeply concerned
with the survival of the Western nations...

1004
01:20:18,446 --> 01:20:21,074
"in face of the threat from the East."

1005
01:20:21,449 --> 01:20:23,280
"Threat from the East."

1006
01:20:23,418 --> 01:20:25,477
<i>Herr</i> Janning, did you hear this?

1007
01:20:25,554 --> 01:20:29,251
Did you hear what's in the paper?
Exactly what Hitler said.

1008
01:20:29,324 --> 01:20:32,054
"The clash for survival
between East and West."

1009
01:20:32,127 --> 01:20:33,788
He knew!

1010
01:20:34,362 --> 01:20:38,230
They'll see that we knew exactly
what we were doing all the time.

1011
01:20:38,300 --> 01:20:42,634
They cannot call us criminals,
and at the same time ask us to help them.

1012
01:20:42,704 --> 01:20:44,467
We must stand together now.

1013
01:20:44,539 --> 01:20:47,303
The most crucial part of this case
is coming up.

1014
01:20:47,876 --> 01:20:50,777
We have fallen on happy times, 
<i>Herr</i> Hahn.

1015
01:20:50,846 --> 01:20:55,408
In old times it would have made your day
if I'd deigned to say good morning to you.

1016
01:20:55,483 --> 01:20:58,179
Now that we are here
in this place together...

1017
01:20:58,253 --> 01:21:01,552
you feel obliged to tell me
what to do with my life.

1018
01:21:01,756 --> 01:21:03,724
<i>Herr</i> Janning, you must stand with us.

1019
01:21:03,792 --> 01:21:06,090
It is not good for Germans
to turn on one another.

1020
01:21:06,161 --> 01:21:08,322
We have a common ground now.

1021
01:21:09,898 --> 01:21:11,763
Listen to me, <i>Herr</i> Hahn.

1022
01:21:11,833 --> 01:21:14,996
There have been terrible things
that have happened to me in my life.

1023
01:21:15,070 --> 01:21:17,038
But the worst thing
that has ever happened...

1024
01:21:17,105 --> 01:21:20,199
is to find myself
in the company of men like you.

1025
01:21:20,275 --> 01:21:23,039
I have nothing in common with you
and Party hacks like you.

1026
01:21:23,111 --> 01:21:26,569
You have something in common.
You were part of that same regime.

1027
01:21:26,648 --> 01:21:29,014
You stood by that regime,
the same as the rest of us.

1028
01:21:29,084 --> 01:21:32,110
And there's something else
you have in common.

1029
01:21:32,554 --> 01:21:34,181
You are a German.

1030
01:23:07,882 --> 01:23:09,349
Good evening. 
Did you like it?

1031
01:23:09,417 --> 01:23:12,215
Yes, I did. 
Very much indeed.

1032
01:23:12,387 --> 01:23:13,376
Can I drop you?

1033
01:23:13,455 --> 01:23:16,982
I only live a few blocks from here.
I was going to walk.

1034
01:23:17,192 --> 01:23:18,921
Would you like to go for a walk?

1035
01:23:19,060 --> 01:23:20,186
Yes, I would.

1036
01:23:20,261 --> 01:23:22,957
I won't need the car now.
I'll walk with Mrs. Bertholt.

1037
01:23:23,031 --> 01:23:25,864
- Shall I wait for you, Your Honor?
- That won't be necessary.

1038
01:23:25,934 --> 01:23:28,198
I'll wait for you, Your Honor.

1039
01:24:03,972 --> 01:24:07,703
The German people love to sing,
no matter what the situation.

1040
01:24:07,876 --> 01:24:09,537
I've noticed that.

1041
01:24:10,779 --> 01:24:14,806
Do American people sing in bars, too?
I have forgotten.

1042
01:24:15,884 --> 01:24:18,717
No. We're apt to be 
pretty sullen in bars.

1043
01:24:30,698 --> 01:24:32,893
I wish you understood German.

1044
01:24:33,802 --> 01:24:36,100
The words are very beautiful.

1045
01:24:36,304 --> 01:24:37,566
Very sad.

1046
01:24:38,239 --> 01:24:40,707
Much sadder than the English words.

1047
01:24:41,676 --> 01:24:45,112
The German soldier knows
he's going to lose his girl...

1048
01:24:46,648 --> 01:24:47,876
and his life.

1049
01:24:50,885 --> 01:24:52,682
The lantern burns every night.

1050
01:24:52,754 --> 01:24:54,551
It knows the steps...

1051
01:24:55,623 --> 01:24:56,954
and the way you walk.

1052
01:24:58,726 --> 01:25:02,059
It burns every night,
but I've been long forgotten.
