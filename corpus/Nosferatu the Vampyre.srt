1
00:18:29,181 --> 00:18:33,101
Of vampires and bloodsuckers.

2
00:18:33,393 --> 00:18:40,525
Of corpses which devour their own flesh.
Of incubuses and succubuses.

3
00:18:40,776 --> 00:18:44,738
Of the living dead who follow strangers
in the night...

4
00:18:44,821 --> 00:18:47,990
...and attack them.
Hmm...

5
00:18:54,206 --> 00:18:58,418
Transylvania... Nosferatu,
beyond death...

6
00:19:00,212 --> 00:19:02,756
...a curse that will last till the end of time.

7
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:06,593
The curse of Nosferatu.

8
00:19:23,193 --> 00:19:25,070
Coachman, could you take me to
the Borgo pass?

9
00:19:25,195 --> 00:19:26,613
I'll pay you well.

10
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:29,116
There is no road to the Borgo pass.

11
00:19:31,535 --> 00:19:33,453
But it's right there.

12
00:19:35,038 --> 00:19:36,622
I need your coach.

13
00:19:36,706 --> 00:19:38,625
I haven't got a coach.

14
00:19:41,628 --> 00:19:44,630
Then I'll take one of your horses.
I'll double the price.

15
00:19:44,756 --> 00:19:47,217
Sorry, sir, but I don't have any
horses. Don't you see?

16
00:19:53,723 --> 00:19:54,724
Well...

17
00:19:55,475 --> 00:19:58,145
I guess I'll have to walk there.

18
00:26:32,956 --> 00:26:35,291
Count Dracula?!

19
00:26:39,545 --> 00:26:43,466
I am Count Dracula.
Welcome to my castle.

20
00:26:44,133 --> 00:26:46,803
You must be Jonathan Harker.

21
00:26:46,886 --> 00:26:48,054
Yes.

22
00:26:49,889 --> 00:26:51,307
Come in.

23
00:26:52,725 --> 00:26:56,312
The night is cold and you must be
tired and hungry.

24
00:27:36,185 --> 00:27:38,271
I've got the papers here.

25
00:27:40,273 --> 00:27:44,527
This is the layout of the house...

26
00:27:44,694 --> 00:27:46,779
...which I'm sure you'd like to see.

27
00:27:55,788 --> 00:27:58,875
Yes, yes.

28
00:28:01,127 --> 00:28:02,712
Please, help yourself.

29
00:28:03,713 --> 00:28:06,382
Please, I'm afraid you must dine alone.

30
00:28:06,466 --> 00:28:10,553
It's nearly midnight and I partake of
nothing at this hour.

31
00:28:24,067 --> 00:28:27,737
Unfortunately, the servants
are not at our disposal.

32
00:28:28,154 --> 00:28:33,576
So allow me to see to your comfort.

33
00:29:24,877 --> 00:29:27,296
Listen.

34
00:29:31,134 --> 00:29:32,135
Listen.

35
00:29:33,302 --> 00:29:36,055
The Children of the Night
make their music.

36
00:29:40,476 --> 00:29:42,562
Ah, young man...

37
00:29:43,646 --> 00:29:47,984
...you're like the villagers who cannot
place themselves in the soul of the hunter.

38
00:31:33,672 --> 00:31:36,175
The knife is old and could be dirty.

39
00:31:37,676 --> 00:31:40,179
It could give you blood poisoning.

40
00:31:40,846 --> 00:31:44,183
Please let me do it. It's the oldest
remedy in the world.

41
00:31:44,267 --> 00:31:47,186
Oh, forget it. It's hardly worth
mentioning. Just a little cut.

42
00:31:58,114 --> 00:32:00,616
You... you know...

43
00:32:01,784 --> 00:32:04,287
...it's only for the best.

44
00:32:43,492 --> 00:32:46,329
Let's sit down for a while.

45
00:32:54,337 --> 00:32:57,340
It's still many hours till dawn.

46
00:32:58,174 --> 00:33:01,010
And during the daytime
I am always away.

47
00:40:04,266 --> 00:40:06,268
Lucy, my love...

48
00:40:09,604 --> 00:40:12,607
...there is no postal service
from here...

49
00:40:12,941 --> 00:40:19,197
...but I shall write a diary, preserving all
my thoughts and feelings for you.

50
00:40:19,447 --> 00:40:24,452
Last night after a tiresome journey,
I finally reached my destination...

51
00:40:25,286 --> 00:40:27,289
...the castle of Count Dracula.

52
00:40:28,123 --> 00:40:32,210
I had a bad dream,
but I hope it will pass.

53
00:40:32,627 --> 00:40:35,005
This castle is so strange.

54
00:40:35,963 --> 00:40:39,384
At times I wonder if it isn't
part of that dream.

55
00:40:39,467 --> 00:40:42,137
Everything about it looks so unreal.

56
00:41:20,133 --> 00:41:23,845
I don't attach importance to the
sunshine anymore...

57
00:41:24,429 --> 00:41:27,098
...or to glittering fountains,
which youth is so fond of.

58
00:41:28,850 --> 00:41:31,311
I love the darkness and the shadows.

59
00:41:33,104 --> 00:41:36,107
Where I can be alone with my thoughts.

60
00:41:44,532 --> 00:41:46,785
I am the descendent of an old family.

61
00:41:51,373 --> 00:41:55,126
Time is an abyss, profound as
a thousand nights.

62
00:41:57,379 --> 00:41:59,798
Centuries come and go...

63
00:42:01,383 --> 00:42:04,678
...to be unable to grow old is terrible.

64
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:09,057
That is not the worst.
There are things more horrible than that.

65
00:42:10,933 --> 00:42:14,813
Can you imagine enduring centuries...

66
00:42:15,814 --> 00:42:19,818
...experiencing the same futility
each day?

67
00:42:22,945 --> 00:42:26,866
I'm glad you found such a large
old house for me.

68
00:42:26,908 --> 00:42:29,661
Very near your lodging, I understand.

69
00:42:29,828 --> 00:42:32,163
Yes, it's just around the corner.

70
00:42:32,247 --> 00:42:34,165
Ah...

71
00:42:35,083 --> 00:42:37,293
...may I have a look at the contract?

72
00:42:48,763 --> 00:42:49,681
What?...

73
00:42:50,765 --> 00:42:52,434
What a lovely throat.

74
00:42:54,352 --> 00:42:57,021
It's my wife, Lucy.

75
00:43:01,192 --> 00:43:02,193
Your hand.

76
00:43:04,279 --> 00:43:05,947
Your hand is so cold.

77
00:43:08,575 --> 00:43:11,453
The document... the contract for
the house, I must sign it immediately.

78
00:43:13,621 --> 00:43:15,707
Yes, but we haven't settled on a price.

79
00:43:15,790 --> 00:43:17,542
It doesn't matter between gentlemen...

80
00:43:17,625 --> 00:43:19,627
...I accept whatever you find just.

81
00:43:34,976 --> 00:43:38,229
How long did it take you
to get here from Wismar?

82
00:43:38,646 --> 00:43:39,814
Four weeks.

83
00:43:45,570 --> 00:43:46,654
I...

84
00:43:50,658 --> 00:43:53,745
...it takes a while to travel on land.

85
00:44:44,212 --> 00:44:47,799
From the seed of Belial is the
vampire born.

86
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:52,136
He who feeds on the
blood of mankind...

87
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:59,352
...who, unredeemed, taketh
his refuge in caves, tombs...

88
00:44:59,477 --> 00:45:04,899
...coffins filled with the unblessed soil
of cemeteries...

89
00:45:05,316 --> 00:45:08,403
...wherein the black death
has reaped its harvest...

90
00:45:09,154 --> 00:45:10,822
...the plague.

91
00:47:21,468 --> 00:47:23,137
Jonathan!

92
00:47:48,912 --> 00:47:51,332
She has a sudden fever.

93
00:47:53,917 --> 00:47:56,420
Her pulse is too fast.

94
00:47:58,255 --> 00:48:00,007
She needs to rest.

95
00:48:02,176 --> 00:48:05,596
Call me if you think it is necessary...

96
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:08,515
...but I don't think it's something serious.

97
00:50:56,767 --> 00:50:59,269
Oh, God, he must be going to Wismar.

98
00:50:59,770 --> 00:51:00,938
Lucy...

99
00:51:02,189 --> 00:51:04,441
Lucy's in danger.

100
00:51:04,942 --> 00:51:06,610
I've got to get out of here.

101
00:53:10,901 --> 00:53:12,486
It's strange...

102
00:53:15,405 --> 00:53:17,824
...but the papers are all in order.

103
00:53:18,241 --> 00:53:22,329
Let me see them...
From Varna to Wismar.

104
00:53:22,412 --> 00:53:25,248
Garden soil for botanical experiments.

105
00:53:28,251 --> 00:53:29,670
Open one of them.

106
00:53:31,338 --> 00:53:33,006
I want to make sure.

107
00:53:33,340 --> 00:53:34,591
This one.

108
00:54:02,202 --> 00:54:07,124
Mother Superior...
stop the black coffins.

109
00:55:02,095 --> 00:55:04,681
The patient who came yesterday
had a seiZure.

110
00:55:04,765 --> 00:55:05,682
Which one?

111
00:55:05,766 --> 00:55:06,932
The one who had bitten a cow.

112
00:55:07,017 --> 00:55:07,934
Oh, yes.

113
00:55:08,018 --> 00:55:09,102
We put him in isolation.

114
00:55:09,186 --> 00:55:10,520
I'll go with you.

115
00:55:13,774 --> 00:55:15,192
Blood is life.

116
00:55:19,946 --> 00:55:21,198
Blood is life.

117
00:55:21,281 --> 00:55:22,866
Has he done it for long?

118
00:55:22,949 --> 00:55:26,536
He has, and he also refuses food.

119
00:55:27,537 --> 00:55:28,705
Blood is life.

120
00:55:28,789 --> 00:55:30,290
Let's go.

121
00:55:32,959 --> 00:55:34,461
Help! Help me!

122
00:55:58,235 --> 00:55:59,236
Be quiet...

123
00:55:59,486 --> 00:56:01,488
I hear the sounds of sails
fluttering in the wind.

124
00:56:26,096 --> 00:56:27,514
Still, there's no letter from him.

125
00:56:28,682 --> 00:56:30,767
But, don't worry, Lucy...

126
00:56:31,518 --> 00:56:35,522
The mail from Transylvania is very slow.

127
00:56:36,439 --> 00:56:38,858
Something has happened to Jonathan.

128
00:56:39,526 --> 00:56:43,029
Have courage, Lucy.
God is listening to our prayers.

129
00:56:44,865 --> 00:56:48,702
God is far away when we need him.

130
00:56:59,212 --> 00:57:01,882
Young man. You're not yet well.
You shouldn't travel.

131
00:57:01,965 --> 00:57:05,635
The black coffins...
I must get to Wismar before the coffins.

132
00:57:05,719 --> 00:57:08,889
You should at least wait for the doctor.
He'll be here tomorrow.

133
00:57:08,972 --> 00:57:13,226
Lucy, my wife, is in danger.
I must save her.

134
00:57:15,145 --> 00:57:16,980
The black coffins.

135
00:57:17,147 --> 00:57:18,899
Evil is on the way.

136
00:58:01,358 --> 00:58:07,364
I'm writing because I believe
there is a curse on my ship.

137
00:58:08,281 --> 00:58:14,037
One by one, four sailors and the
second mate have taken ill and died.

138
00:58:15,372 --> 00:58:19,042
Another sailor and our cook have
disappeared without a trace.

139
00:58:20,460 --> 00:58:26,633
A rumor of a mysterious stranger
on board scares everyone to death.

140
00:58:27,217 --> 00:58:33,556
We searched the boat and we found
nothing, except rats.

141
00:58:34,140 --> 00:58:37,227
We are maintaining our course.

142
00:58:37,310 --> 00:58:40,563
Northwest at 30 degrees.
The wind is steady. 12 knots.

143
00:59:02,752 --> 00:59:04,253
Mr. Renfield...

144
00:59:04,587 --> 00:59:09,509
...you sent my husband
to Transylvania...

145
00:59:10,510 --> 00:59:13,095
...and I haven't heard
from him in weeks.

146
00:59:13,346 --> 00:59:15,515
I'm very concerned...

147
00:59:17,016 --> 00:59:20,102
...I want to go there and look for him.

148
00:59:23,689 --> 00:59:26,776
Don't go yet.
My master is coming.

149
00:59:27,443 --> 00:59:29,278
Who did you say is coming?

150
00:59:30,029 --> 00:59:32,031
The Lord of the Rats.

151
00:59:33,699 --> 00:59:38,037
He's bringing with him thousands
and thousands of rats.

152
00:59:40,873 --> 00:59:45,378
Orderly, give him some more food.
I think we should leave now.

153
01:00:05,815 --> 01:00:06,816
The plague.

154
01:03:50,623 --> 01:03:52,374
The Master has arrived.

155
01:04:03,052 --> 01:04:04,887
The Master has arrived.

156
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:36,519
Lay a gangplank across.

157
01:04:36,602 --> 01:04:38,604
We need to search the ship.

158
01:05:03,546 --> 01:05:04,797
Cut him loose.

159
01:05:24,150 --> 01:05:27,987
There's not a soul on board.
Just some freight.

160
01:05:29,071 --> 01:05:32,074
But there are rats everywhere.

161
01:05:32,241 --> 01:05:34,911
Here's the ship's log.

162
01:06:23,459 --> 01:06:25,962
It's truly a mystery.

163
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:33,219
I think, gentlemen, that the ship's log
may give us a clue.

164
01:06:36,389 --> 01:06:42,645
Varna, June 6. Myself, the Captain, five
hands, two mates and a cook...

165
01:06:42,979 --> 01:06:45,147
...direction, the Dardanelles.

166
01:06:49,569 --> 01:06:51,153
Course westward.

167
01:06:51,571 --> 01:06:54,407
Today a third man died of a high fever.

168
01:06:54,991 --> 01:07:00,246
Last night, while on his watch,
a mate disappeared without a trace.

169
01:07:00,746 --> 01:07:04,166
June 20th. Course northward
towards Biscaya.

170
01:07:04,250 --> 01:07:06,168
Speed 40 knots. Tall waves.

171
01:07:06,252 --> 01:07:08,671
Fear grows among my men.

172
01:07:08,921 --> 01:07:13,759
Now only the first mate
and I remain alive.

173
01:07:13,926 --> 01:07:17,680
There are rats everywhere.
Could it be a plague?

174
01:07:20,766 --> 01:07:23,603
Go home quietly, please.

175
01:07:24,186 --> 01:07:26,772
Shut the doors and windows,
gentlemen.

176
01:11:48,701 --> 01:11:51,203
Gracious lady, we brought this man.

177
01:11:51,787 --> 01:11:54,206
He says he lives here.

178
01:11:54,540 --> 01:11:55,624
Lucy!

179
01:11:57,793 --> 01:11:58,961
Jonathan!

180
01:12:12,265 --> 01:12:13,976
Who is this woman?

181
01:12:24,778 --> 01:12:26,363
Bring him in, please.

182
01:12:40,377 --> 01:12:46,008
It looks like he's suffering
from brain fever.

183
01:12:52,765 --> 01:12:54,850
The sun is hurting my eyes.

184
01:13:12,451 --> 01:13:17,413
Dr. Van Helsing. Do you think
we've all gone mad...

185
01:13:17,956 --> 01:13:21,793
...and that one morning we'll all wake up
and find ourselves in straight-jackets?

186
01:15:48,356 --> 01:15:51,610
Excuse me for not knocking...

187
01:15:52,777 --> 01:15:54,863
...I am Count Dracula.

188
01:15:56,615 --> 01:15:58,700
I know who you are.

189
01:15:59,451 --> 01:16:02,954
I read Jonathan's diary.

190
01:16:04,247 --> 01:16:07,626
He wrote everything that went on
in your castle, while he was there.

191
01:16:08,209 --> 01:16:11,796
- Don't worry, he won't die.
- Yes...

192
01:16:12,714 --> 01:16:15,050
...he will. Death surrounds us.

193
01:16:16,134 --> 01:16:18,303
We're all at his will.

194
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:27,062
The rivers continue to flow without us.

195
01:16:28,772 --> 01:16:30,815
Time flies by.

196
01:16:32,150 --> 01:16:34,069
Even the stars...

197
01:16:34,819 --> 01:16:38,406
...they wander towards us
in a very strange way.

198
01:16:39,824 --> 01:16:41,826
Only death is certain.

199
01:16:42,577 --> 01:16:44,579
Only death is cruel.

200
01:16:46,331 --> 01:16:49,334
Death is cruelty
against the unsuspecting.

201
01:16:49,834 --> 01:16:52,420
But that's not what I perceive as cruel.

202
01:16:53,505 --> 01:16:57,258
Cruel is when you can't die
even if you want to.

203
01:16:57,968 --> 01:17:00,553
Give me some of your love...

204
01:17:00,595 --> 01:17:03,223
...which you give Jonathan.

205
01:17:05,225 --> 01:17:06,851
I never will.

206
01:17:07,017 --> 01:17:10,772
I won't even give that love to God.

207
01:17:11,690 --> 01:17:14,109
If Jonathan can't have my love...

208
01:17:14,150 --> 01:17:15,944
...then, no one else will.

209
01:17:16,361 --> 01:17:18,321
If I wish, he'll recogniZe you again.

210
01:17:18,863 --> 01:17:22,200
But first, come and give me your love.

211
01:17:22,701 --> 01:17:25,120
Only then, will I give you
your husband back.

212
01:17:25,704 --> 01:17:27,205
And as for me...

213
01:17:28,873 --> 01:17:31,835
...the absence of love...

214
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:36,631
...is the most abject pain.

215
01:17:38,383 --> 01:17:41,553
The power of my love
will bring him back to me.

216
01:17:43,471 --> 01:17:45,640
And you may be assured...

217
01:17:46,808 --> 01:17:48,810
...even the unthinkable will not
deter me...

218
01:17:48,893 --> 01:17:51,479
...that you want to lay for me.

219
01:18:07,078 --> 01:18:08,580
Good night.

220
01:19:09,974 --> 01:19:10,974
Stop!

221
01:19:14,521 --> 01:19:18,191
Help! Help!

222
01:19:38,503 --> 01:19:41,631
Nosferatu, the undead.

223
01:19:42,132 --> 01:19:46,594
He drinks the blood of his victims, and
turns them into phantoms of the night.

224
01:19:47,762 --> 01:19:51,349
Like a shadow, he has no reflection.

225
01:19:53,017 --> 01:19:56,229
He goes through walls and closed
doors...

226
01:19:56,521 --> 01:19:59,440
...as if they never existed.

227
01:20:00,024 --> 01:20:03,778
Like a bat, he wafts into dark bedrooms.

228
01:20:04,028 --> 01:20:09,242
Masquerading as a black wolf,
he hunts his fleeing victims.

229
01:20:09,617 --> 01:20:13,204
Abandon all hope,
you who cross his path.

230
01:20:24,215 --> 01:20:28,219
Yet even vampires, who are
considered unnatural creatures...

231
01:20:28,303 --> 01:20:32,265
...are subject to some laws of nature.

232
01:20:32,891 --> 01:20:35,810
The sight of the cross bans him.

233
01:20:36,227 --> 01:20:38,980
The consecrated host...

234
01:20:39,022 --> 01:20:44,903
...can bar his retreat.

235
01:20:45,737 --> 01:20:49,157
And if a pure hearted woman...

236
01:20:49,824 --> 01:20:52,493
...diverts his attention
from the cry of the cock...

237
01:20:52,827 --> 01:20:56,748
...the first light of day will obliterate him.

238
01:21:17,769 --> 01:21:20,730
What is your wish, Master?

239
01:21:25,526 --> 01:21:27,028
Go north...

240
01:21:29,280 --> 01:21:30,698
...to Riga.

241
01:21:32,200 --> 01:21:36,204
The army of rats and the Black Death
will follow you.

242
01:21:38,373 --> 01:21:40,500
Oh... Thy will be done.

243
01:21:40,541 --> 01:21:43,294
Amen...!
Amen...!

244
01:22:25,503 --> 01:22:28,339
The plague! The plague!
What are you doing here?

245
01:22:28,506 --> 01:22:30,091
I must talk to the town council.

246
01:22:30,258 --> 01:22:32,677
It's been dissolved.
It doesn't exist anymore.

247
01:22:33,177 --> 01:22:34,429
Then, I must see the mayor.

248
01:22:34,512 --> 01:22:37,348
He's dead.
Go back home, as fast as you can.

249
01:22:38,391 --> 01:22:41,352
I know why this evil is happening!

250
01:22:42,186 --> 01:22:45,440
I know why this evil is happening!

251
01:22:46,357 --> 01:22:49,110
Why won't you listen to me?!

252
01:22:51,195 --> 01:22:53,281
I know the reason why.

253
01:23:12,550 --> 01:23:16,054
My child. It's all a figment
of your imagination.

254
01:23:16,512 --> 01:23:18,222
But Dr. Van Helsing...

255
01:23:19,057 --> 01:23:22,769
...you've read
Jonathan's diary.

256
01:23:23,394 --> 01:23:26,356
You've seen what has
happened to him.

257
01:23:26,939 --> 01:23:29,150
It's getting worse here every day.

258
01:23:29,317 --> 01:23:31,027
The plague. The rats.

259
01:23:34,197 --> 01:23:38,326
And this book about the vampires.

260
01:23:39,994 --> 01:23:41,996
This book explains it.

261
01:23:44,499 --> 01:23:46,584
This is an enlightened century.

262
01:23:46,667 --> 01:23:50,588
Science has refuted the superstitions
you're talking about.

263
01:23:51,255 --> 01:23:53,091
I know it exists.

264
01:23:53,257 --> 01:23:55,927
I believe what I see with my own eyes.

265
01:23:56,344 --> 01:23:58,178
Faith... Faith...

266
01:23:58,680 --> 01:24:00,723
Yes, faith.

267
01:24:01,099 --> 01:24:03,184
Yes, faith, Dr. Van Helsing.

268
01:24:03,601 --> 01:24:04,602
Faith.

269
01:24:05,686 --> 01:24:08,773
Faith is the faculty in men...

270
01:24:08,855 --> 01:24:12,026
...which enables us to believe things...

271
01:24:12,110 --> 01:24:14,612
...we know to be untrue.

272
01:24:17,782 --> 01:24:21,119
You must come and help me
destroy this monster.

273
01:24:21,953 --> 01:24:24,038
We must look for him.

274
01:24:25,123 --> 01:24:27,417
Coffins have come by boat
from the Black Sea.

275
01:24:27,792 --> 01:24:30,795
We can search for them tonight,
and destroy them.

276
01:24:31,003 --> 01:24:35,675
My child, you need some rest.

277
01:24:36,384 --> 01:24:39,053
Your husband's condition has
worn you out.

278
01:24:39,345 --> 01:24:41,222
No, Dr. Van Helsing.
Tonight.

279
01:24:41,305 --> 01:24:45,309
I need to study this matter
scientifically.

280
01:24:45,393 --> 01:24:50,565
No! Tonight! There's no time to lose.

281
01:24:51,065 --> 01:24:55,153
Even a farmer knows that there's
a time to plant and a time to sow.

282
01:24:55,319 --> 01:25:00,074
He doesn't dig up the wheat to check
if it is growing.

283
01:25:00,158 --> 01:25:04,745
Only children playing farmers
would do such things.

284
01:25:10,626 --> 01:25:15,006
I guess I'll have to do this alone!

285
01:25:21,637 --> 01:25:23,431
Well, then.

286
01:25:55,505 --> 01:25:58,299
Mother Superior, my medicine.

287
01:26:10,228 --> 01:26:13,564
My lady, how exactly did we meet?

288
01:32:51,545 --> 01:32:52,546
Join us, please.

289
01:32:52,630 --> 01:32:55,215
Would you like a drink?
Be our guest.

290
01:32:55,799 --> 01:32:59,969
We've all contracted the plague. Let's
enjoy whatever time we have to live.

291
01:33:20,157 --> 01:33:23,494
Madam Lucy! Madam Lucy!
Open up!

292
01:33:26,580 --> 01:33:29,750
Come quickly to the Schraders...

293
01:33:30,250 --> 01:33:32,169
Something terrible has happened there.

294
01:34:01,031 --> 01:34:04,201
Lucy, calm down.

295
01:34:04,284 --> 01:34:07,621
You can come closer.
It is not the plague.

296
01:34:10,290 --> 01:34:13,877
My God! What happened?

297
01:34:14,211 --> 01:34:15,713
I don't know exactly.

298
01:34:15,796 --> 01:34:19,298
She was already dead, when I arrived.

299
01:34:20,801 --> 01:34:25,222
He lost his sanity over it,
he started to rave.

300
01:34:28,225 --> 01:34:32,563
We shall study this
matter scientifically...

301
01:34:32,646 --> 01:34:36,483
...without prejudice,
and without superstition.

302
01:34:39,570 --> 01:34:43,907
Enough! Enough. Stop acting like
you know everything.

303
01:34:45,241 --> 01:34:48,912
I know, now, what I've got to do.

304
01:35:19,526 --> 01:35:23,530
The consecrated host
bans the vampire.

305
01:35:46,136 --> 01:35:51,558
And if a pure hearted woman, diverts
his attention from the cry of the cock...

306
01:35:52,559 --> 01:35:55,896
...the first light of day will obliterate him.

307
01:42:24,784 --> 01:42:28,455
Too late. Oh, God...

308
01:42:28,538 --> 01:42:31,791
...if I had only listened to her.

309
01:42:41,635 --> 01:42:45,138
A stake and a hammer.

310
01:42:45,972 --> 01:42:49,309
I have to dispatch this demon forever.

311
01:43:03,739 --> 01:43:07,244
Stop. Don't do it!

312
01:43:38,441 --> 01:43:39,526
Van Helsing!

313
01:43:40,443 --> 01:43:42,112
Get him! Yes, him!

314
01:43:42,612 --> 01:43:44,531
That man has murdered the Count!

315
01:43:46,449 --> 01:43:47,951
Have you done that?

316
01:43:50,954 --> 01:43:52,289
With that stake?

317
01:43:52,539 --> 01:43:56,375
Yes...
But I had a good reason for doing it.

318
01:43:56,459 --> 01:43:57,961
That's for the courts to decide.

319
01:43:58,295 --> 01:44:00,880
You're under arrest, Dr. Van Helsing.

320
01:44:01,798 --> 01:44:02,966
Arrest this man.

321
01:44:04,050 --> 01:44:05,218
Arrest him?

322
01:44:05,385 --> 01:44:08,138
- I can't arrest him.
- Then get the police.

323
01:44:08,221 --> 01:44:09,973
The police don't exist anymore.

324
01:44:10,223 --> 01:44:12,309
Then take him to prison.

325
01:44:12,475 --> 01:44:14,728
There's no one there to guard him.

326
01:44:14,811 --> 01:44:16,813
It's your duty as a town employee
to handle it.

327
01:44:16,896 --> 01:44:18,982
I don't have a weapon.

328
01:44:19,064 --> 01:44:21,818
I don't care!
I want you to arrest this man!

329
01:44:22,736 --> 01:44:25,322
Where will you take me, then?

330
01:44:29,409 --> 01:44:31,161
I don't know where I'm taking you.

331
01:44:31,244 --> 01:44:34,581
Take me wherever you want.

332
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:38,835
Don't just stand there.

333
01:44:40,003 --> 01:44:44,924
Get a broom. It's all dusty.

334
01:45:08,948 --> 01:45:12,452
Seal the room for
an official investigation.

335
01:45:13,370 --> 01:45:16,623
And bring me my horse.

336
01:45:17,040 --> 01:45:21,544
I have much to do.
Now!
