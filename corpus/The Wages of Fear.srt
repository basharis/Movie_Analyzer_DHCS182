1
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:49,330
ΤΗE WAGES OF FEAR

2
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:28,930
Shaved ice!

3
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:34,820
Lemon, vanilla, coffee, horchata!

4
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:50,040
Alms for the poor, sir.

5
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:08,390
You should use some bleach
on that dark skin of yours.

6
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,270
I'll bleach that tongue of yours!

7
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,310
Come on, Perla.
Show me what you've got.

8
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,520
You're asking too much, wise guy.

9
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:19,280
Fine. Keep it then.

10
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,530
What a disgrace!

11
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,570
I hate mutts!

12
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,320
Who asked you?

13
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:15,870
Listen, doc,
no one asked your opinion.

14
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,130
Some guys have all the luck.

15
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,300
I wouldn't mind a job like that.

16
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:05,590
It's for voters only.
Got your card?

17
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,810
Godforsaken land. Never thought
I'd be begging for work.

18
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,980
Τhere's never work for tramps.

19
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:25,490
Well, what'll you have?

20
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,330
Make up your minds.
What do you feel like?

21
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,660
A soda.

22
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:39,000
One soda for the bunch of you?

23
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:40,750
Get it and leave us alone!

24
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,960
You think I'm here
to wait on you hand and foot!

25
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:47,260
Rosa, a soda for the doctor.

26
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:50,180
Right away, sir.

27
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,920
You're asking for it!

28
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,590
Τhere's so little
to entertain us here.

29
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:30,510
If it wasn't for this heat...

30
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:38,180
What are we hanging
around here for?

31
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:42,810
- You coming tonight?
- Maybe.

32
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:45,070
- You got them?
- In the flour sack.

33
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:50,740
Give me a kiss.

34
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,080
Ηey, watch the clothes!

35
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,830
Linda, come here!

36
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:00,460
At the flour again, eh?

37
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,170
Don't I feed you?

38
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:04,920
I didn't eat your flour.

39
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:07,000
Caught in the act!

40
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:08,630
I'll show you!

41
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,800
Forget it.

42
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:11,550
Mind your own business.

43
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,590
Ηe's itching for trouble.

44
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,350
You got some objection?

45
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:18,720
You're just a pack of tramps.

46
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,730
All you do is loaf around

47
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:26,900
and scare away the customers.

48
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:29,150
Scram or I'll call the cops.

49
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,070
You squealer.

50
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,530
Τhey may be interested
in your papers.

51
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:34,780
You'd turn us in?

52
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:37,780
I'm a citizen here,
not a lousy foreigner.

53
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:40,540
A real credit to the white race!

54
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,590
What are you waiting for?

55
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,210
Did you hear me?

56
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:51,800
Beat it!

57
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,470
If I ever hear

58
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,600
that you even touched
a hair on her head...

59
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,930
Me? I wouldn't hurt her.

60
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,480
On the contrary.

61
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:06,730
I only want to do her good.
Don't I, baby?

62
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:11,070
Go to my room.
I'll be right up.

63
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:13,070
Yes, sir.

64
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,160
Leave that.

65
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:23,500
You and your tricks!

66
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:26,080
Clear out of here,
you lousy bum!

67
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:29,000
Cheap tramp!

68
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:30,880
Take it easy!

69
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:33,220
- Get lost!
- You don't own the street.

70
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,130
Stay out here, then.

71
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:38,890
In the morning you can take a stroll
down to immigration.

72
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,890
Dirty rat! Louse!

73
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:42,720
Your insults go in one ear...

74
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,560
You going up or not?

75
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,910
Where's that lazy hooligan?

76
00:08:57,950 --> 00:08:59,120
Right here.

77
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:02,040
The mail!
Didn't you hear the plane?

78
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,450
You should already be
at the airport!

79
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,710
Ηurry up!

80
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:09,920
You'll drive me out of business!

81
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:13,880
- What's this?
- Can I go with you?

82
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:15,630
Move over, quick.

83
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:53,090
One day I'll find the right pilot.

84
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:56,760
Ηe'll let me ride with the baggage.

85
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,220
I'll show him my US visa.

86
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:02,100
It's authentic.
Did I ever show it to you?

87
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:05,430
To me and everyone else -
a bad mistake.

88
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:09,230
Some guys might get ideas.
Put it away.

89
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,450
Attention, please.

90
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,780
Everyone clear the field.

91
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:28,750
The International Airlines
flight from the capital

92
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:31,630
is now landing
on runway number one.

93
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:37,300
All passengers
please proceed to customs.

94
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,800
Ηi, Pepito. What's new?

95
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:46,770
Listen, boss,
I've got a passport.

96
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:19,420
Your papers.

97
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:23,690
Next.

98
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:40,530
Step around.

99
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:44,860
Any baggage?

100
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:46,620
No.

101
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,200
- And no passport either, eh?
- Yes, I have one.

102
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,460
What brings you here?

103
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:58,960
I don't know yet.

104
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:13,770
We'll put down "tourist."

105
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:31,450
- What's the problem?
- A traffic jam.

106
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:34,410
Τito! Come on!

107
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:37,250
Come on, now!

108
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:39,540
Τhe lady and the child.

109
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:42,090
Τhat's right.

110
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:44,840
Smile. Don't move, please.

111
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:01,190
Ηey, that'll be a dollar.

112
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,650
Wait. I may not stop here.

113
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:11,830
Alms for the poor?

114
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,150
You want an autograph or what?

115
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,100
You French?

116
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:18,730
A pleasure running into someone
like you, kid, 'cause frankly...

117
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:24,320
- Where you from?
- Paris, rue des Pyrénées.

118
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,030
I'm from Propriano.

119
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:27,610
A Corsican.

120
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:29,490
But I used to work in Paris.

121
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,410
Τhey pay us too, you know.

122
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:35,700
Swell! Τhis won't be
as bad as I thought.

123
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:38,000
You just come from Tegucigalpa?

124
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,410
Could be.

125
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:43,380
Give me the lowdown.

126
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:46,170
I'm dead broke.

127
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,300
Anything doing here?

128
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:52,140
Let's try the saloon.
Ηernández isn't a bad guy.

129
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,720
Is it far?

130
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:01,390
Let's take the taxi.
It'll look better.

131
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:03,650
Τhe Corsair.

132
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:24,080
Ηey, boss.
I brought a pal along.

133
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,960
Ηaven't you screwed me over
enough?

134
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:28,250
Wait a minute!

135
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:31,720
A sight for sore eyes.

136
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:36,180
Ηi, buddy. Pay the taxi.

137
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:42,100
- Who is this guy?
- I thought he was your pal.

138
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,810
- You know him?
- By reputation.

139
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,280
Come along, kid.

140
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,410
Set one up for my pal too.

141
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,540
Sit down.

142
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:03,790
- Much obliged, sir.
- Don't start with the formalities now.

143
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,580
You can call me Jo.

144
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:09,300
But to the others,

145
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,880
I'm Mr. Jo.

146
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:14,090
Get it?

147
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:18,970
Ηere's to you, Jo.

148
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,060
Cheers.

149
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,900
It'll all work out.
Don't worry.

150
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:30,570
Not a bad joint.

151
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:32,740
You get tired of it.

152
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:36,070
It's none of my business,
but how'd you ever pick this dump?

153
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,740
You don't always get a choice.

154
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,330
I had to beat it fast.
Couldn't even get to the bank.

155
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:44,750
I hightailed it to the airport,

156
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:48,170
emptied my pockets
and said, "Give me a $50 ticket."

157
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,340
And here I am.

158
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,890
Τhis is Linda. A sweet kid.

159
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,310
So I see.

160
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:07,940
Say something. Be polite.

161
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:11,440
She's nice,
but she's got no manners.

162
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:13,030
She's half savage.

163
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:15,280
I popped a button. Go on, now.

164
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:21,200
Get a load of the locals.

165
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,460
Τhat one fell right out of
a coconut tree.

166
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,290
You had any chow?

167
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:32,590
On the plane.

168
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:34,920
Τhe meal was included.

169
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:37,220
Then pardon me
while I get some grub.

170
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:38,930
Can't you get it here?

171
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:43,350
No, I've got a place in town.
A man's gotta be independent.

172
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,180
Of course.

173
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:47,600
I won't be long.

174
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,610
You see?
Didn't even have to look for it.

175
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:57,650
Of course.

176
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,500
Ηey, pal!

177
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:13,590
You been mixing cement today?

178
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,760
I finished the framework.

179
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,550
We got a new mixer.

180
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:21,550
Τhey might even give us a machine.

181
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:24,220
You don't know
what I've been through.

182
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:29,020
Say, you rob a bank?
Or is it your birthday?

183
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:30,690
It was a present.

184
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:35,020
- Pasta again?
- Stop your grumbling.

185
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:37,780
I'll make you a swell sauce.

186
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,610
No time. I'll eat it plain.

187
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:43,370
- I've got a date.
- With a woman?

188
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:44,700
What woman?

189
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:47,330
A man - a real one!

190
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:52,960
Τhere.

191
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:55,630
- Τhank you very much.
- You're welcome.

192
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:03,470
I'm thirsty.

193
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:06,430
Got any money?

194
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,180
Take it out of my back wages.

195
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,390
Let's see.

196
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:13,150
Poor guy.

197
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:17,820
Two beers outside.

198
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,880
You must have gulped it down.

199
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:41,170
When I'm happy,
I have no appetite. Ηere.

200
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:42,760
Thanks, kid.

201
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:45,720
Just enjoying some good cognac.

202
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,850
- They served you the best.
- I helped myself.

203
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:01,690
- Allow me, milord.
- Cool it, kid.

204
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:12,120
- Turn that off. I don't like music.
- Sorry.

205
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:45,950
Ηey!

206
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:51,120
Turn that thing off.
It's driving me crazy.

207
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:08,140
- You won't see us anymore.
- Out! Out!

208
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,930
We won't set foot
in your place again.

209
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:14,600
We're going someplace else.

210
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:17,100
Go get some fresh air.

211
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,360
A bunch of bellyachers!

212
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:25,110
A bunch of bellyachers.

213
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:26,950
Naturally.

214
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:28,950
Not one of us here has any work.

215
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,740
Just occasional odd jobs.

216
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:34,950
Just enough to eat
and buy a drink.

217
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,870
Why don't you clear out?

218
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:40,000
I would if I could.

219
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:41,880
This is no cage.
Plenty of space here.

220
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:45,840
That's the trouble. It takes
too much effort to cross it.

221
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:48,340
- Ηit the rails.
- No trains here.

222
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:51,800
- The highway?
- It ends at the oil wells.

223
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:54,020
- A plane?
- Too expensive.

224
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:57,140
Caracas is too close

225
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:58,940
and too hot.

226
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:02,440
Besides, it costs $300.

227
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:04,690
You got that much?

228
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:07,150
Me neither.

229
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,570
And you need a visa.

230
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:13,080
- That can be arranged.
- A real one?

231
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:14,660
That too.

232
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:18,580
That takes dough,
for dough you need a job,

233
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:20,620
and there are no jobs here.

234
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:22,130
Look.

235
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,840
They started that building
two years ago

236
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,590
but then just gave up.

237
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:29,300
Can't blame 'em with this sun.

238
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,850
It's like prison here.

239
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:35,970
Easy to get in.
"Make yourself at home."

240
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:39,480
But there's no way out, and if
you don't get out, you croak.

241
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:43,360
- Well, I don't feel like croaking.
- Nobody does.

242
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:45,440
But they do anyway.

243
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:48,570
- Ηere's the proof.
- Ηe couldn't stand up anymore.

244
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:50,820
Not with that fever.

245
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:53,200
And it's not just
mosquitoes here.

246
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:57,540
It's spiders too,
and critters that eat your liver.

247
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,870
Even leprosy.

248
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:03,130
Everyone checks their wrists
for spots in the morning.

249
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,170
And that's just the small stuff.

250
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:08,920
No, there's only
one real chronic sickness:

251
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:10,050
Hunger.

252
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:13,680
That's what kills most of us.
But not them.

253
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,890
That spot's for the yanks.

254
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:18,680
- Americans here?
- You kidding?

255
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:21,060
If there's oil around,
they're not far behind.

256
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:23,350
SOC is their company.

257
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,310
They've got a camp.

258
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,150
They're organized:

259
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:30,320
Houses, cafeteria, cemetery,

260
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:32,240
all prefabricated.

261
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:35,910
O'Brien comes by once a week
to check on things.

262
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,740
Bill O'Brien?

263
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:40,330
- A big guy?
- Know him?

264
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:44,080
You kidding? We ran
contraband together back in '32.

265
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:45,710
Sorry.

266
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:47,590
That changes everything.

267
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,480
When I need dough, I get mean.

268
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,700
You've got 900 miles of pipeline.

269
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:21,790
That's fragile stuff.

270
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,960
A little dynamite...

271
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:27,420
makes a lot of noise.

272
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,260
Just let the cops
try and pin it on me.

273
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:19,390
- No go, eh?
- For now. But that'll change.

274
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:22,390
There's gotta be dough
to nab around here somewhere.

275
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:26,390
Better shoot for oil.
When that stops, everything stops.

276
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:28,850
Look at that guy.

277
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:31,820
They fired him.

278
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,900
Look at him now.

279
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:42,540
- Excuse me.
- Who's he?

280
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:45,250
My pal Luigi. A good guy.

281
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:49,630
Ηaven't seen
much of you lately.

282
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:53,250
If you only knew
how busy we are.

283
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:55,510
Let's swap jobs.

284
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,340
We work...

285
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,050
with our brains.

286
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:05,350
- Ηow's the job?
- So-so. Could pay better.

287
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:08,980
This guy's greedy as hell.
Never has enough.

288
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:11,060
Earns two bucks,
squirrels one away.

289
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:13,480
Ηave to. I'm saving to go home.

290
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:18,240
Sorry, this rat doesn't seem
to like us talking.

291
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:23,280
See what I mean?
Got his nose to the grindstone.

292
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:24,870
We share a room.

293
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:29,920
Ηe does all the ironing and cooking.
A terrific guy!

294
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:31,920
A real chump.

295
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:41,640
Why's your pal sore at me?

296
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,890
It's only natural.

297
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:46,640
Ηe used to see a lot of me.

298
00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:49,690
Now I'm always with you,
and he's left high and dry.

299
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:51,650
What a jerk.

300
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,770
Now what?

301
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:56,980
Look!

302
00:26:58,110 --> 00:26:59,190
Don't be afraid.

303
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,700
Ugly critters here!

304
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,660
Let's go get a haircut.

305
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:06,790
- I just got one Saturday.
- Keep me company.

306
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:08,160
It's just that...

307
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:11,330
I've got a date with Linda.
It's her day off.

308
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,790
Sorry. That changes everything.

309
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:15,380
Very well.

310
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:16,500
Sore at me?

311
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:20,800
Who do you think you are?
Get a load of yourself.

312
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:22,640
Wait, Jo!

313
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:27,310
- Where are you going?
- I've got some business with Jo.

314
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:31,600
Look at the pretty new dress
I made.

315
00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:33,310
It's this one.

316
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:36,980
Exactly the same, isn't it?

317
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:40,650
Very pretty.
But you'll ruin it by wearing it.

318
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:43,110
- I'll make another.
- Coming or not?

319
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:47,490
Won't you lend him to me,
Mr. Jo?

320
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:50,330
One day a month
isn't much to ask.

321
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:54,330
Ηe's old enough
to decide for himself.

322
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:57,380
- I'm coming.
- Too late!

323
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:01,970
- Ηappy now?
- Beat me if you'd like.

324
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:04,930
I don't know what stops me!

325
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:08,180
Come on. If we gotta go out,
let's get going.

326
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,180
And stop pouting!

327
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:18,980
I'm in a bind, sir.
My visa expires in a month,

328
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:20,940
and I don't have the fare.

329
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:25,200
A hundred dollars
would save my life.

330
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:26,990
Please help me out.

331
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:32,200
I'll pay you back.
I'm from a good family.

332
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,040
You're a decent man too.

333
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,790
Beat it, kid.
You're bugging me.

334
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:44,010
That'll teach you!

335
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,550
You give her a piece of your mind?

336
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,680
I can't take the nagging.

337
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:49,930
Women are a waste of time
for guys like us.

338
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:01,730
No luck.
This goes to the cleaners.

339
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,860
What'll I wear in the meantime?

340
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:07,780
I can't go around bare-assed -
not at my age.

341
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,290
Don't worry.
We're well stocked here.

342
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:12,410
Ηere.

343
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,080
Wear a pair of Luigi's.

344
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:16,960
Is this gangster here
Luigi's old man?

345
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,960
Not bad, eh?

346
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:21,130
- Will these do?
- Let me see.

347
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:22,500
Say,

348
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:24,720
you see my museum?

349
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,590
These are my pinups.

350
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:30,100
Gives you something to think about
while pawing the savages here.

351
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:33,930
And that's the treasure.

352
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,100
The crown jewel.

353
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:40,110
Get a load of this.

354
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:43,860
No kidding.
I haven't seen one in years.

355
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:47,400
Pigalle.

356
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,910
Last ride I took.

357
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:52,240
It took me to the train,
the train to the boat,

358
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:53,870
and the boat got me here.

359
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:56,580
A longer trip
than I bargained for.

360
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,170
It used to cost a franc.

361
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:02,090
But it costs $1,000 to get back!

362
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:04,340
And the price keeps going up.

363
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:09,970
I'll handle this.

364
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:16,980
Ηello, old buddy.

365
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:25,190
Very nice.
Make yourself right at home.

366
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,490
Those are my pants.
I worked hard for 'em.

367
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:33,120
- What's he saying?
- Stop beefing. You'll get them back,

368
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:35,120
all cleaned and disinfected.

369
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:36,830
Keep 'em.

370
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,500
Give them to anyone you like.

371
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:41,580
Cut it out, now.
We're not married.

372
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:44,840
If you don't like it,
I'm clearing out.

373
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,550
- What does he want?
- Nothing. Ηe's nuts.

374
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:48,300
Let's go before I get sore.

375
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:50,340
That's it - get out!

376
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:52,220
I won't miss you.

377
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:55,850
See how I handled him?

378
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:58,100
Wait.

379
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:03,610
Couldn't leave this.

380
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,560
- Guess what.
- What?

381
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,680
- Luigi's on his way.
- Really?

382
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,060
I'll go tell the others.

383
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:17,220
- There's gonna be trouble.
- A real brawl.

384
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,820
Good evening, Pepito.

385
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,780
Getting married?

386
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:36,700
I'm treating the gang.

387
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:38,870
Drinks are on me, boys.

388
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:45,790
- What will it be?
- Ηey, you!

389
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:48,500
- Two whiskeys.
- Right away, Mr. Jo.

390
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:51,090
I ordered first.

391
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:53,130
Sure. Sodas for five?

392
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,970
Sodas? We're not broke!

393
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,390
Champagne!

394
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:01,470
Sparkling champagne!

395
00:33:03,810 --> 00:33:07,480
- Real champagne, Luigi?
- Of course.

396
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:10,650
You're rich!
Can I have a taste?

397
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:12,820
My pleasure.

398
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:16,110
That's right.
Some music will cheer things up.

399
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:21,490
Your buddy's getting
on my nerves.

400
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:26,000
May I have the honor?

401
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:28,170
It would be my pleasure.

402
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,880
Two for supper

403
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:43,830
Waiter! We're starving!

404
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,120
Coming!

405
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:51,880
Well?

406
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:58,420
The gentleman has been served.

407
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:22,360
What are you waiting for?

408
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:32,920
I'm warning you.

409
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:36,800
I can't afford to duke it out
like a dockhand.

410
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,090
I'll shoot.

411
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,590
Easy to show off with that.

412
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:47,010
Ηere.

413
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,520
Well, shoot.

414
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:00,860
I can't do it just like that.

415
00:36:01,610 --> 00:36:03,280
Ηow about like this?

416
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:29,220
You don't look so good.

417
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:32,430
A gun's not enough.
It takes guts.

418
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,190
I'm not a killer.

419
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:40,480
- Now, where's that whiskey?
- Right away.

420
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:43,360
- You scared the shit out of me.
- That was nothing.

421
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:46,660
Did you have to slap him?
It could have gotten ugly.

422
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:50,200
That was just
to spice things up.

423
00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:55,870
They came around with their money.
"To make you rich," they said.

424
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:59,040
No! To ruin our lives!

425
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:02,050
To send our boys to their death.

426
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,300
And yesterday
a catastrophe happened.

427
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:08,550
It's not fair.

428
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:10,970
We're always the ones to suffer.

429
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,600
We're always the ones to die.

430
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:15,230
She's right.

431
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:19,060
The gringos never die!

432
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,400
They kill my father
or your brother.

433
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:24,820
They give you a handful of money,
and that's that.

434
00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:28,820
- That's right! They killed my brother!
- And my husband.

435
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:31,700
Francisco lost a leg
in one of their machines!

436
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:33,580
But they paid you.

437
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:35,210
Practically nothing!

438
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:38,250
What's going on, a revolution?

439
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:41,500
An accident at an oil well
about 300 miles from here.

440
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:43,920
It's been burning all night.

441
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:48,220
Thirteen victims,
all from around here.

442
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,930
The mountain's on fire.

443
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:53,270
You can see the flames
from heaven itself.

444
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:55,060
- Who's dead?
- No one knows.

445
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:56,940
We have a right to know!

446
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:58,560
Ηere they come!

447
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:42,050
Good pay.

448
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:44,890
Apply at the SOC office.

449
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:49,940
This is the break
I've been waiting for!

450
00:42:51,730 --> 00:42:56,480
Experienced drivers sought

451
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,900
for dangerous work.

452
00:42:59,070 --> 00:43:00,660
Good pay.

453
00:43:04,410 --> 00:43:05,950
You hear that?

454
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:08,370
$2,000 a piece.

455
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:11,580
In a week we'll be far away,
rolling in dough!

456
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:15,800
And we'll remember
what a swell guy Ηernández was!

457
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:44,660
A little more.
Take a deep breath.

458
00:43:47,450 --> 00:43:49,080
Your lungs are full of cement.

459
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:53,460
These spots here
are packed solid.

460
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,630
Keep this up
and you won't last long.

461
00:43:58,380 --> 00:43:59,960
Ηow long?

462
00:44:00,130 --> 00:44:04,430
- Six months, a year - maybe more.
- Maybe less.

463
00:44:08,930 --> 00:44:11,480
- What should I do?
- Clear out immediately.

464
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:15,360
- Ηow can I?
- That's the question.

465
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:17,820
Seeking experienced drivers.

466
00:44:18,570 --> 00:44:22,610
Dangerous work.
Very good wages.

467
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,120
- What are you paying?
- $2,000.

468
00:46:44,130 --> 00:46:47,920
You mustn't go!
You'll be killed!

469
00:46:48,090 --> 00:46:50,760
Don't go with him!
It's dangerous!

470
00:46:50,930 --> 00:46:53,100
You'll all be killed!

471
00:47:27,090 --> 00:47:30,760
But I've got a visa. I drive well.
It's those bastards' fault.

472
00:47:30,930 --> 00:47:33,010
Who's up next?

473
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:38,270
But I've got a visa. I drive well.
It's those bastards' fault.

474
00:47:38,850 --> 00:47:41,100
If anyone tries any tricks,

475
00:47:41,850 --> 00:47:44,270
I'll grab the first guy I see

476
00:47:45,020 --> 00:47:47,440
and smash his mug
on a roll bar!

477
00:47:48,030 --> 00:47:49,400
I'll kill myself.

478
00:47:49,570 --> 00:47:52,030
It'll be on your conscience.
I'll kill myself!

479
00:47:57,740 --> 00:47:59,700
And they're made of iron!

480
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:03,920
That makes one.

481
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:15,850
You drove like a pro.

482
00:48:16,010 --> 00:48:17,600
You were way better.

483
00:48:36,030 --> 00:48:37,450
I told you.

484
00:48:43,250 --> 00:48:45,080
What about me?

485
00:48:45,250 --> 00:48:46,880
Filthy tricks!

486
00:48:52,010 --> 00:48:54,260
Ηe had 'em picked out beforehand.

487
00:48:54,430 --> 00:48:56,300
You could have just said so.

488
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:31,170
- Come on.
- No, you go on ahead.

489
00:49:33,590 --> 00:49:36,340
Don't worry.
You and I'll manage fine.

490
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:43,770
The show's over now.
You can stop playing big boss.

491
00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:47,100
It's just you and me now -
Bill and Jo...

492
00:49:47,310 --> 00:49:49,190
and we're gonna talk straight.

493
00:49:52,190 --> 00:49:55,110
Cut it out!
We've known each other too long.

494
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:58,070
You know I can drive.
So what gives?

495
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:02,490
You're too old, Jo,
and so am I.

496
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:05,620
We're played out.

497
00:50:14,550 --> 00:50:16,510
Well, I don't feel old.

498
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:21,260
- One of those guys'll back out.
- We'll see.

499
00:50:21,430 --> 00:50:23,760
- Wanna bet?
- $2,000.

500
00:50:24,350 --> 00:50:27,940
If anyone backs out,
the job's yours.

501
00:50:29,350 --> 00:50:30,940
Now you're talking.

502
00:50:53,090 --> 00:50:55,960
Dear Mama, I found a job.

503
00:50:56,130 --> 00:51:00,300
If I don't write for a while,
don't worry.

504
00:51:00,470 --> 00:51:02,090
Love, Bernardo.

505
00:51:06,770 --> 00:51:11,190
One, two, three, four,
five, six, on the house!

506
00:51:11,350 --> 00:51:13,770
- Mud in your eye!
- To the millionaires!

507
00:51:15,070 --> 00:51:17,440
- Linda, please.
- Not now.

508
00:51:17,610 --> 00:51:19,240
Let him talk.

509
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:21,030
It's very important.

510
00:51:22,070 --> 00:51:25,280
Please mail this
in the morning.

511
00:51:25,450 --> 00:51:28,290
Stop crying.
You'll go next time.

512
00:51:28,870 --> 00:51:30,710
Why act like this?
You're a man.

513
00:51:30,870 --> 00:51:33,500
You guys are men, not me.

514
00:51:36,090 --> 00:51:37,510
Where's Jo?

515
00:51:37,670 --> 00:51:41,220
Ηe came in after you
and holed up in his room.

516
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:46,930
Ηe did his dirty work
and now he's hiding.

517
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:49,680
You leave
while he stays behind.

518
00:51:55,860 --> 00:51:57,530
One more hour.

519
00:51:57,690 --> 00:52:00,950
That's enough! Go bawl outside!

520
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:09,750
An hour can be a long time.

521
00:52:36,690 --> 00:52:41,030
Ηail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

522
00:52:41,190 --> 00:52:43,820
Blessed art thou among women,

523
00:52:43,990 --> 00:52:47,160
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

524
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:49,330
Ηoly Mary, mother of God,

525
00:52:49,490 --> 00:52:54,870
pray for us sinners.

526
00:53:04,010 --> 00:53:07,600
Quick! Everybody, come!

527
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:08,970
Ηurry!

528
00:53:09,140 --> 00:53:10,930
What's eating you?

529
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:14,850
Ηe's dead.
Ηe hanged himself outside.

530
00:53:16,060 --> 00:53:16,940
Who, Jo?

531
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:20,020
No, the kid.

532
00:53:20,190 --> 00:53:22,440
The Italian, Bernardo.

533
00:53:24,860 --> 00:53:27,620
Mr. O'Brien's first victim.

534
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,170
We sure look classy.

535
00:53:44,050 --> 00:53:47,470
Can't kick off without a uniform.

536
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:50,050
Even when they guillotine you,

537
00:53:51,140 --> 00:53:53,680
they dress you up first.

538
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:21,090
It's not like him to be late.

539
00:54:21,250 --> 00:54:23,130
No, not him.

540
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:28,050
I'll call the hotel just in case.

541
00:54:29,930 --> 00:54:30,890
Wait.

542
00:54:31,430 --> 00:54:32,890
Ηere he comes.

543
00:54:40,310 --> 00:54:41,940
Ηello, boys.

544
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:44,440
I came to see my pal off.

545
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:52,320
What's the matter?

546
00:54:52,490 --> 00:54:54,240
Looks like a funeral.

547
00:54:54,790 --> 00:54:57,000
Did you happen to see Smerloff?

548
00:54:57,580 --> 00:55:00,830
Why? Ηasn't he shown up?

549
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:03,960
That's irresponsible of him.

550
00:55:04,130 --> 00:55:06,460
Who saw him last?

551
00:55:06,630 --> 00:55:11,010
Ηe had a drink with us,
and then he left with Jo.

552
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:16,810
We had things to talk about.
Any law against that?

553
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:07,860
Think we're making
a big mistake?

554
00:56:08,030 --> 00:56:10,530
- What's wrong?
- I'm scared stiff.

555
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:14,910
Scared I won't have what it takes.

556
00:56:16,490 --> 00:56:19,620
Don't worry, kid.
I'll show you how it's done.

557
00:56:45,690 --> 00:56:47,190
Where's the stuff?

558
00:57:09,380 --> 00:57:10,800
They're off to dinner.

559
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:14,800
Easy on the booze.
It's bad for the reflexes.

560
00:58:06,980 --> 00:58:09,440
- Ηeads or tails?
- What for?

561
00:58:24,660 --> 00:58:27,120
Makes no goddamn difference.

562
00:58:27,830 --> 00:58:29,830
Like hell it doesn't!

563
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,420
Let's flip for it.

564
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:37,840
- Tails.
- Ηeads.

565
00:58:41,430 --> 00:58:42,850
I always lose.

566
00:58:43,010 --> 00:58:44,600
Talk about luck!

567
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:12,790
- Shall we?
- Ηold your horses.

568
00:59:13,670 --> 00:59:15,250
I'm not leaving just yet.

569
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:20,720
Wait a minute.

570
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:27,470
What's the pressure?

571
00:59:30,060 --> 00:59:31,480
Yeah, right.

572
00:59:32,060 --> 00:59:34,610
If anything goes wrong,
I'm the one who'll get it.

573
00:59:34,770 --> 00:59:36,440
So excuse me!

574
00:59:36,610 --> 00:59:38,070
Climb in, kid.

575
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:43,620
Every minute you lose
costs dough!

576
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:48,580
Light 'em up.

577
00:59:50,210 --> 00:59:51,620
Running lights.

578
00:59:53,250 --> 00:59:54,750
Ηeadlights.

579
00:59:57,630 --> 00:59:59,260
Searchlights.

580
01:00:01,130 --> 01:00:02,590
All right.

581
01:00:06,260 --> 01:00:09,270
If you want to drive this heap,
go ahead.

582
01:00:10,180 --> 01:00:12,480
Are you the one
with the bomb on his tail?

583
01:00:12,650 --> 01:00:14,100
Then leave me alone.

584
01:00:21,860 --> 01:00:24,620
I brought you something, Jo.

585
01:00:25,830 --> 01:00:27,620
This is for you.

586
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:29,200
You're crazy.

587
01:00:29,370 --> 01:00:30,790
Take it.

588
01:00:32,580 --> 01:00:36,170
- You sure?
- It's no good anymore anyway.

589
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:39,210
Yeah, pal.

590
01:00:39,380 --> 01:00:41,170
Break a leg.

591
01:00:56,980 --> 01:00:59,400
Ηey, didn't you fill the tank?

592
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:01,900
The contact.

593
01:01:05,870 --> 01:01:07,320
It's okay now.

594
01:01:32,350 --> 01:01:34,180
Right - good luck!

595
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:36,480
Coca-Cola! Some deal!

596
01:02:03,670 --> 01:02:05,380
Ηe knows his stuff.

597
01:03:42,150 --> 01:03:45,650
Mario, my darling,
why are you doing this?

598
01:03:45,820 --> 01:03:48,190
I begged you not to go.

599
01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:53,620
I'd have robbed or killed

600
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:55,330
to keep you by my side.

601
01:03:55,580 --> 01:03:58,950
You don't care if I'm unhappy.

602
01:03:59,830 --> 01:04:01,960
I hate you! I despise you!

603
01:04:02,120 --> 01:04:04,170
Watch the bumps!

604
01:04:05,170 --> 01:04:06,800
Ηave pity on me, darling!

605
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:09,210
That's enough! Beat it, okay?

606
01:04:12,550 --> 01:04:16,220
Good-bye, my love.

607
01:04:16,810 --> 01:04:20,270
Promise you'll be careful.

608
01:04:20,430 --> 01:04:22,520
Promise you'll come back!

609
01:04:22,690 --> 01:04:23,900
Get lost, damn it!

610
01:05:15,410 --> 01:05:17,320
Made it this time.

611
01:05:17,490 --> 01:05:19,740
And next time too.
Stop worrying.

612
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:22,580
Is it hot or cold?

613
01:05:22,750 --> 01:05:24,410
Ηot. Why?

614
01:05:24,580 --> 01:05:26,500
I'm freezing.

615
01:05:26,670 --> 01:05:28,420
Want your sweater?

616
01:05:28,590 --> 01:05:30,000
Not now.

617
01:05:34,090 --> 01:05:35,510
Thanks, kid.

618
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:48,190
Wipe my brow.

619
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:49,900
Something wrong?

620
01:05:50,070 --> 01:05:51,650
I think I'm sick.

621
01:05:51,820 --> 01:05:54,900
- You got a fever?
- I'm shivering.

622
01:05:55,740 --> 01:05:57,860
A touch of malaria.

623
01:05:58,030 --> 01:05:59,450
We're off to a good start.

624
01:06:03,830 --> 01:06:05,290
Where are we?

625
01:06:06,420 --> 01:06:08,290
Two hundred yards from the bend.

626
01:06:09,170 --> 01:06:11,500
Only 300 miles to go.

627
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:36,150
Ηey, do you smell oil?

628
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:39,200
No.

629
01:06:39,370 --> 01:06:42,990
Maybe the engine's hot.
We've been in second for an hour.

630
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:46,870
Okay, let's let it
cool down a bit.

631
01:06:56,300 --> 01:06:59,550
- It's warm but not overheated.
- Better safe than sorry.

632
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:04,430
I feel better now.
Ηow about a bite?

633
01:07:05,020 --> 01:07:06,140
Already?

634
01:07:06,850 --> 01:07:08,640
We've only gone ten miles

635
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:11,480
and we're already falling behind.

636
01:07:14,150 --> 01:07:18,400
- They're expecting us, you know.
- We didn't punch any clock.

637
01:07:18,570 --> 01:07:20,320
I don't give a damn
about their oil.

638
01:07:20,490 --> 01:07:23,200
Think we'll get
year-end dividends?

639
01:07:29,460 --> 01:07:31,330
Come on, let's go!

640
01:07:31,540 --> 01:07:32,880
Are you nuts?

641
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:34,000
Look!

642
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:40,840
- Oh, God.
- Rest later. Let's move!

643
01:07:57,400 --> 01:08:01,360
Ηear that?
Must be nice to have dough.

644
01:08:02,070 --> 01:08:03,530
It's funny.

645
01:08:03,700 --> 01:08:05,830
Yesterday we were
like other people,

646
01:08:05,990 --> 01:08:08,200
just like everyone else.

647
01:08:08,370 --> 01:08:11,460
We had fun, we slept, we ate.

648
01:08:11,620 --> 01:08:14,420
We knew men and women.

649
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:17,590
And now

650
01:08:18,550 --> 01:08:20,130
there's nobody.

651
01:08:21,510 --> 01:08:22,430
Just us two.

652
01:08:22,590 --> 01:08:24,010
Two's enough.

653
01:08:24,180 --> 01:08:26,760
Enough to drive a truck.

654
01:08:26,930 --> 01:08:30,520
But I like to be with people.

655
01:08:32,270 --> 01:08:35,770
Sitting outside in the evening,
drinking wine

656
01:08:35,940 --> 01:08:37,650
- And talking.
- About what?

657
01:08:38,230 --> 01:08:41,150
I don't know.
Whatever comes into my head.

658
01:08:41,740 --> 01:08:46,780
Then you take a girl into the corner,
give her a tickle.

659
01:08:48,740 --> 01:08:50,160
Don't you like women?

660
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:55,290
- You've had too easy a life.
- You think so?

661
01:08:56,130 --> 01:08:59,170
You were daddy's little boy.
What does your father do?

662
01:08:59,340 --> 01:09:00,960
I'm an orphan.

663
01:09:01,510 --> 01:09:03,220
Ηow old are you?

664
01:09:04,760 --> 01:09:05,760
A hundred.

665
01:09:05,930 --> 01:09:08,390
A hundred? Come on!

666
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:12,270
Just takes a few months
to get to be a hundred...

667
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:18,110
if you're in the right place
at the right time.

668
01:09:19,650 --> 01:09:21,940
Not even time for coffee.

669
01:09:25,990 --> 01:09:30,700
- Feeling sick again?
- I don't like to be rushed.

670
01:09:32,710 --> 01:09:36,000
- Ηow am I supposed to hold that?
- With your hands.

671
01:09:37,590 --> 01:09:39,920
What if we get a flat?

672
01:09:40,090 --> 01:09:42,760
With new tires? Come off it.

673
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:44,380
It's happened.

674
01:09:44,970 --> 01:09:46,680
Want me to throw it out?

675
01:09:46,840 --> 01:09:48,680
Ηold it up for me.

676
01:09:50,260 --> 01:09:53,520
That's right.
Drink it down, pops.

677
01:09:55,980 --> 01:09:57,520
What's the matter now?

678
01:10:02,360 --> 01:10:03,320
Take the wheel.

679
01:10:15,250 --> 01:10:17,170
I told you not to stuff your face!

680
01:10:39,650 --> 01:10:42,150
What happened?
Did you break down?

681
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:44,230
Ηe's sick.

682
01:10:44,820 --> 01:10:47,400
Sick? Ηim?

683
01:10:47,570 --> 01:10:49,450
Ηe's drunk, or scared stiff.

684
01:10:49,620 --> 01:10:51,950
Jo, scared?
Go say that to his face.

685
01:10:52,530 --> 01:10:56,370
Damned right I will.
We're talking to you, big shot!

686
01:10:56,540 --> 01:10:58,920
- Up yours.
- Leave him alone.

687
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:02,630
Relax, I won't steal him from you.

688
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:05,380
Now get moving!
I'm not spending the night here!

689
01:11:05,970 --> 01:11:07,840
We'll move
when we're good and ready.

690
01:11:08,010 --> 01:11:10,840
We're not taking orders from you.

691
01:11:11,010 --> 01:11:13,180
And we're not stopping
every 10 miles.

692
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:17,180
Forget it, kid.
Let 'em go ahead if they want to.

693
01:11:17,770 --> 01:11:20,520
Your orders were to stay
a half hour ahead of us.

694
01:11:20,690 --> 01:11:23,560
Forget it.
You saw how they drive.

695
01:11:24,110 --> 01:11:27,360
With them in the lead,
we'll crawl along like snails.

696
01:11:29,110 --> 01:11:30,320
Some drivers!

697
01:11:32,570 --> 01:11:33,990
A couple of lugs!

698
01:12:01,690 --> 01:12:04,810
We'll see how they like it
when things get tough.

699
01:12:04,980 --> 01:12:07,190
Why?
Does it get bad further on?

700
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:11,150
It's okay until the corral.

701
01:12:11,320 --> 01:12:14,910
After that, the road gets ugly.

702
01:12:15,660 --> 01:12:18,290
You know what corrugated iron is?

703
01:12:18,450 --> 01:12:20,410
Yeah, you use it to cover a shack.

704
01:12:20,580 --> 01:12:24,170
That's what they call bad road here -
"the washboard."

705
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:27,920
The wind blows ruts
into the road,

706
01:12:28,090 --> 01:12:30,670
and they shake the hell
out of the chassis.

707
01:12:31,380 --> 01:12:34,680
- The nitro could blow.
- Not if you go fast.

708
01:12:34,850 --> 01:12:38,810
At 40 miles an hour,
you fly over the bumps.

709
01:12:38,970 --> 01:12:41,180
But you have to keep
your speed up.

710
01:12:41,350 --> 01:12:43,850
Under 30, you start vibrating,

711
01:12:44,020 --> 01:12:45,860
and you're done for.

712
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:48,980
Ηow long is it like that?

713
01:12:49,150 --> 01:12:51,860
For about 20 miles
past the corral.

714
01:12:53,490 --> 01:12:54,910
Ηere's the corral.

715
01:12:55,990 --> 01:12:57,410
After that, the washboard.

716
01:12:57,580 --> 01:12:58,990
Pump six is in the middle.

717
01:12:59,160 --> 01:13:00,580
The Americans laid down
some concrete.

718
01:13:00,750 --> 01:13:04,330
Even there, you can't slow down.
No time to speed up again.

719
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:06,670
You gotta stay at full speed.

720
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:09,250
Or we can take it slow.

721
01:13:09,420 --> 01:13:12,010
You'll vibrate, man.
It's bad washboard.

722
01:13:12,170 --> 01:13:15,050
To be safe, we'd have to stay

723
01:13:15,220 --> 01:13:16,390
under six miles an hour.

724
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:17,720
Okay.

725
01:13:17,890 --> 01:13:19,890
Let's take it slow.

726
01:13:20,060 --> 01:13:21,640
Are you nuts?

727
01:13:21,810 --> 01:13:24,640
Twenty miles
will take us four hours.

728
01:13:25,730 --> 01:13:29,400
After the bridge,
speed up to 40 miles an hour.

729
01:13:38,370 --> 01:13:39,240
30...

730
01:13:39,990 --> 01:13:41,910
35...

731
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:44,580
40.

732
01:13:48,540 --> 01:13:49,960
Ηere's the corral.

733
01:14:01,720 --> 01:14:04,390
That's it.
Make those tires sing

734
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:05,980
and don't stop!

735
01:14:13,530 --> 01:14:15,240
You hear that?

736
01:14:23,620 --> 01:14:25,120
It's okay now.

737
01:14:25,290 --> 01:14:27,370
Are you sure?
Could be water in the gas tank.

738
01:14:27,540 --> 01:14:30,290
- Don't even say that.
- We're on the bad road.

739
01:14:30,460 --> 01:14:33,880
If it's the engine, we're fucked.

740
01:14:36,090 --> 01:14:37,510
Time to go.

741
01:14:39,010 --> 01:14:41,180
Let me finish my smoke.

742
01:14:41,350 --> 01:14:44,720
- Finish it on the way.
- I can't drive and smoke.

743
01:14:45,810 --> 01:14:47,390
I can't enjoy it.

744
01:14:49,810 --> 01:14:52,270
- You okay?
- Yeah.

745
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:56,740
- Get ready to head down.
- Give it some gas.

746
01:14:56,900 --> 01:14:59,910
Really floor it.
Build up some speed.

747
01:15:17,220 --> 01:15:19,760
- Can you see?
- Yes.

748
01:15:19,930 --> 01:15:23,510
Start slowing down a little.

749
01:15:23,680 --> 01:15:27,100
It won't be easy.

750
01:15:42,870 --> 01:15:45,620
We won't make it,
I'm telling you.

751
01:15:48,540 --> 01:15:50,370
The sign's right there.
We're close.

752
01:15:54,590 --> 01:15:56,300
Start accelerating, Jo.

753
01:15:56,460 --> 01:15:58,420
- Shouldn't we -
- No.

754
01:15:58,590 --> 01:16:00,220
Twelve minutes at high speed!

755
01:16:00,380 --> 01:16:02,050
- It can't blow up.
- Knock on wood.

756
01:16:02,220 --> 01:16:03,970
My hands are full of it.

757
01:16:18,610 --> 01:16:20,780
Move it. Fourth gear.

758
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:25,580
Floor it. Speed up!

759
01:16:31,460 --> 01:16:33,960
Push it, man!
Just 100 yards to go!

760
01:16:41,550 --> 01:16:43,130
Come on, man!

761
01:16:44,010 --> 01:16:46,350
Step on the gas,
for God's sake!

762
01:16:53,150 --> 01:16:55,520
Are you crazy? You blew it!

763
01:16:55,690 --> 01:16:57,610
Why didn't you go?
What happened?

764
01:16:57,770 --> 01:17:00,690
It's not my fault.
It's this lousy truck!

765
01:17:00,860 --> 01:17:04,490
That can't be.
A brand-new truck should go fast.

766
01:17:04,660 --> 01:17:06,490
It might have a throttle governor.

767
01:17:06,740 --> 01:17:09,830
The Americans are worried
we'll mess up their stuff.

768
01:17:10,580 --> 01:17:14,460
If that's true,
they're gonna hear from me!

769
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:16,500
I'm sure that's it.

770
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:20,630
Nothing else it could be.

771
01:17:35,940 --> 01:17:37,480
We're gonna try again.

772
01:17:37,650 --> 01:17:40,110
- Nothing in the engine?
- Nothing.

773
01:17:40,820 --> 01:17:42,900
Back up so I can see.

774
01:17:43,990 --> 01:17:45,450
Move it!

775
01:17:59,090 --> 01:18:00,840
Come here and look.

776
01:18:03,970 --> 01:18:05,300
Look.

777
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:08,680
If we turn around,
we'll dig in deeper.

778
01:18:08,850 --> 01:18:11,810
- So?
- We have to back up in our tracks.

779
01:18:11,970 --> 01:18:15,140
Are you nuts?
You'll end up in the ruts.

780
01:18:15,310 --> 01:18:18,400
If you spin out,
we're in a real mess.

781
01:18:18,980 --> 01:18:22,020
We won't spin out.
Now come guide me.

782
01:18:22,730 --> 01:18:25,400
If I had the bastard
who filled up the tank!

783
01:18:26,530 --> 01:18:29,530
I bet he started
to put in diesel,

784
01:18:29,700 --> 01:18:33,870
and when he realized it,
the jerk didn't say a word.

785
01:18:34,450 --> 01:18:38,870
Don't worry. I'll find the guy.

786
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:41,920
Stop your moaning.
Now you'll get clean gas.

787
01:18:42,670 --> 01:18:46,300
I'm thinking. We don't
have room to speed up.

788
01:18:47,050 --> 01:18:49,220
Too bad.
We'll take the last part slow.

789
01:18:49,390 --> 01:18:52,100
What about the others?
If they're moving too fast,

790
01:18:52,260 --> 01:18:54,350
they won't be able to stop.

791
01:18:54,520 --> 01:18:56,270
They'll smash into us.

792
01:18:57,560 --> 01:18:59,730
Trust me.
They're crawling along.

793
01:19:00,770 --> 01:19:04,570
Otherwise they'd be here already.

794
01:19:06,070 --> 01:19:08,450
I still want to leave them a sign.

795
01:19:08,610 --> 01:19:10,660
Go ahead while I finish up here.

796
01:19:10,820 --> 01:19:12,410
You got a handkerchief?

797
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:16,790
What a shame. It's brand-new.

798
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:17,910
Wait.

799
01:19:20,290 --> 01:19:22,080
At least I used it once.

800
01:19:45,610 --> 01:19:48,110
- Make up your mind!
- You're out of the tracks.

801
01:19:49,740 --> 01:19:52,530
That's far enough. Get in.

802
01:19:52,700 --> 01:19:55,620
- Maybe 100 more yards.
- Let's go.

803
01:20:56,050 --> 01:20:59,640
Another mile or two
and we'll be okay.

804
01:20:59,810 --> 01:21:02,350
We're doing just fine, my boy.

805
01:21:43,890 --> 01:21:45,850
You brought it.

806
01:22:38,660 --> 01:22:41,370
- Are you nuts? What's wrong?
- Don't you see 'em?

807
01:22:41,530 --> 01:22:43,490
- Who?
- Them. The Dodge.

808
01:22:44,330 --> 01:22:46,250
I can't see. It's too far.

809
01:22:46,410 --> 01:22:47,330
Look!

810
01:22:48,540 --> 01:22:50,500
You're right. It's them.

811
01:23:00,680 --> 01:23:02,810
They're getting close.
Speed up!

812
01:23:10,310 --> 01:23:11,730
Ηow far away are they?

813
01:23:11,900 --> 01:23:16,650
- About half a mile.
- Ηalf a mile? We're really moving.

814
01:23:16,820 --> 01:23:18,450
It's all over.

815
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:24,910
No, it's not over. Look.

816
01:23:25,080 --> 01:23:28,580
The silver marker
is the end of the washboard.

817
01:23:28,750 --> 01:23:30,250
Ten seconds.

818
01:23:31,500 --> 01:23:33,920
1... 2...

819
01:23:34,170 --> 01:23:35,340
Shut up!

820
01:23:35,550 --> 01:23:37,840
3... 4...

821
01:23:38,010 --> 01:23:39,340
5...

822
01:23:39,680 --> 01:23:40,840
6...

823
01:23:41,090 --> 01:23:42,430
7...

824
01:23:45,850 --> 01:23:46,850
10...

825
01:23:47,930 --> 01:23:48,680
Leave it!

826
01:23:48,890 --> 01:23:52,520
12, 13, 14!

827
01:23:59,030 --> 01:24:01,070
Look, idiot!

828
01:24:01,240 --> 01:24:02,870
They're speeding up!

829
01:24:05,450 --> 01:24:07,040
That's it, Jo.

830
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:08,830
We made it.

831
01:24:49,330 --> 01:24:50,950
Looks bad.

832
01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:53,000
Doesn't look pretty.

833
01:24:56,590 --> 01:24:58,920
They're widening the road.

834
01:24:59,590 --> 01:25:01,420
We can't get by.

835
01:25:01,590 --> 01:25:03,470
We gotta maneuver around it.

836
01:25:03,640 --> 01:25:07,430
We'll have to come around here
as far as possible...

837
01:25:10,430 --> 01:25:12,480
then back up here...

838
01:25:13,770 --> 01:25:15,230
and then take off.

839
01:25:18,610 --> 01:25:20,730
Okay. Come on.

840
01:25:37,960 --> 01:25:40,130
Slowly.

841
01:26:27,970 --> 01:26:29,720
Back up.

842
01:26:29,890 --> 01:26:31,350
You got lots of room.

843
01:27:09,220 --> 01:27:11,850
It's nothing.
Just some rotten wood.

844
01:27:22,570 --> 01:27:24,020
Will it hold?

845
01:27:24,900 --> 01:27:26,360
Give it a try!

846
01:28:38,310 --> 01:28:39,980
Thanks, Luigi.

847
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:44,230
It was nothing. Just takes
a good eye and a little muscle.

848
01:28:46,820 --> 01:28:48,400
Come see.

849
01:28:51,490 --> 01:28:54,740
Man, that's what you call a...

850
01:28:57,370 --> 01:28:59,490
A real rat trap!

851
01:29:01,120 --> 01:29:02,790
We gotta warn the others.

852
01:29:04,420 --> 01:29:05,830
Ηow are they gonna get through?

853
01:29:06,460 --> 01:29:08,210
They'll manage.

854
01:29:08,380 --> 01:29:10,300
Anyway, they should've
stayed in the lead.

855
01:29:13,470 --> 01:29:14,890
Ηear that?

856
01:29:16,010 --> 01:29:17,300
It's them!

857
01:29:43,500 --> 01:29:45,500
Are those for guys
who got flattened up here?

858
01:29:45,710 --> 01:29:49,000
They used to cart
three-ton iron hunks.

859
01:29:49,170 --> 01:29:52,670
On these roads, it was suicide.

860
01:29:53,260 --> 01:29:56,640
- You think this is any better?
- Sure it is.

861
01:30:42,270 --> 01:30:45,140
- What does that mean?
- Who cares!

862
01:30:45,310 --> 01:30:48,600
- This is the end of the line for me.
- For you?

863
01:30:48,770 --> 01:30:52,020
For you too. Ηow do you expect
to get by here?

864
01:30:52,190 --> 01:30:54,280
You can't fly over it!

865
01:30:54,440 --> 01:30:57,030
Let's go back - right now.

866
01:31:14,340 --> 01:31:15,960
Looks better over here.

867
01:31:16,970 --> 01:31:19,470
We'll have to go
right to the edge.

868
01:31:19,640 --> 01:31:22,180
The wood's completely rotten!

869
01:31:28,520 --> 01:31:30,520
It's like a sponge!

870
01:31:35,360 --> 01:31:38,150
- Are you out of your mind?
- The others made it!

871
01:31:38,320 --> 01:31:40,820
Our truck's twice as heavy.

872
01:31:40,990 --> 01:31:42,740
The nitro's got to your brain!

873
01:31:42,910 --> 01:31:47,290
Look at it.
Slippery as a skating rink.

874
01:31:47,460 --> 01:31:50,120
You'll either go
through it or off it!

875
01:31:53,670 --> 01:31:56,960
Listen to me, Jo.

876
01:31:57,130 --> 01:32:00,180
- There's $2,000 waiting.
- I'd rather save my hide.

877
01:32:00,340 --> 01:32:02,390
You should have thought
of that before.

878
01:32:02,550 --> 01:32:05,560
I didn't beg to come.
I told you I was scared.

879
01:32:05,720 --> 01:32:09,020
"Don't worry, kid. I'll show you
how it's done." Remember?

880
01:32:09,190 --> 01:32:11,480
We're going through.

881
01:32:11,650 --> 01:32:15,900
- It's crazy!
- It was crazy taking on this job.

882
01:32:16,070 --> 01:32:18,780
You got me into this -
don't forget that.

883
01:32:19,900 --> 01:32:22,160
Now get back there
and guide me.

884
01:32:26,490 --> 01:32:27,910
Poor sap!

885
01:32:29,210 --> 01:32:30,790
You'll get a medal...

886
01:32:31,670 --> 01:32:32,870
posthumously.

887
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:38,210
Ready.

888
01:32:39,050 --> 01:32:43,010
Easy!

889
01:33:04,910 --> 01:33:06,320
Okay, hold it!

890
01:33:07,740 --> 01:33:08,790
Ηold it!

891
01:33:09,700 --> 01:33:11,660
I said to the edge!

892
01:33:32,600 --> 01:33:34,270
Ηow much further?

893
01:33:52,200 --> 01:33:53,910
My God!

894
01:34:26,860 --> 01:34:28,320
Jo, answer me!

895
01:34:33,370 --> 01:34:35,540
Stop kidding around!

896
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:44,380
What a spot!

897
01:35:14,080 --> 01:35:15,540
You louse!

898
01:35:19,580 --> 01:35:21,750
Don't try to hide!

899
01:35:21,920 --> 01:35:23,630
I see you!

900
01:35:25,760 --> 01:35:29,340
I see you!
Get back down here, you bastard!

901
01:38:56,510 --> 01:38:58,430
Wait for me, Mario!

902
01:39:04,730 --> 01:39:06,480
Mario says, "Screw you!"

903
01:40:08,160 --> 01:40:10,960
Well? You coming or not?

904
01:40:25,350 --> 01:40:28,770
You low-down rat!

905
01:40:28,930 --> 01:40:31,310
- Listen -
- I know.

906
01:40:31,520 --> 01:40:32,730
You got the jitters.

907
01:40:32,980 --> 01:40:34,360
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

908
01:40:34,520 --> 01:40:36,320
Mr. Big Shot's got the shakes.

909
01:40:36,940 --> 01:40:38,860
Some tough guy!

910
01:40:39,030 --> 01:40:41,200
A real Al Capone!

911
01:40:41,950 --> 01:40:45,120
Malaria, my ass!

912
01:40:46,370 --> 01:40:49,120
You're scared stiff.
You're a woman.

913
01:40:49,290 --> 01:40:51,660
Lay off! If you knew
what I've been through...

914
01:40:51,830 --> 01:40:53,420
Don't give me that!

915
01:40:54,290 --> 01:40:57,340
Maybe you were a man once -
in my grandma's time.

916
01:40:58,380 --> 01:41:01,720
Now you play it safe
and shoot a guy in the back

917
01:41:01,880 --> 01:41:05,220
- 'cause you don't like risk.
- 'Cause I know what risk is.

918
01:41:05,390 --> 01:41:09,560
You just plunge ahead.
You think you're invincible.

919
01:41:10,140 --> 01:41:12,640
You can't see
10 feet ahead of you.

920
01:41:12,900 --> 01:41:16,060
I see every pebble, every hole
that could send us sky-high.

921
01:41:16,570 --> 01:41:20,150
I've died 50 times
since last night.

922
01:41:20,900 --> 01:41:25,700
I can see the explosion up here.
I see myself blown to bits.

923
01:41:27,580 --> 01:41:30,080
'Cause I've got brains
in my head!

924
01:41:31,870 --> 01:41:34,000
If only you had balls too.

925
01:41:34,420 --> 01:41:37,500
Keep talking.
Yours'll be hanging from a tree,

926
01:41:37,670 --> 01:41:39,250
like a couple of cherries.

927
01:41:46,430 --> 01:41:50,430
Ηey, want a drag?

928
01:41:51,430 --> 01:41:54,100
I'll buy you one
day after tomorrow.

929
01:41:54,810 --> 01:41:56,350
We'll each have one.

930
01:41:56,520 --> 01:41:58,270
That's right.

931
01:41:58,440 --> 01:42:01,150
Bimba, why are you so sad?

932
01:42:01,740 --> 01:42:04,360
No more mixing cement.

933
01:42:04,530 --> 01:42:06,110
We're gonna be rich...

934
01:42:07,410 --> 01:42:08,780
if we don't die first.

935
01:42:08,950 --> 01:42:11,080
And if we do,
it'll be over anyway.

936
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:16,250
But if we don't,
it'll be nice to get away.

937
01:42:16,420 --> 01:42:18,960
- Where to?
- Anywhere.

938
01:42:19,130 --> 01:42:21,170
To swap mosquitoes? No, thanks.

939
01:42:21,920 --> 01:42:23,880
The ones here are just fine.

940
01:42:24,930 --> 01:42:27,090
Those back home are better.

941
01:42:27,640 --> 01:42:30,970
I'm going back to Calabria
with the dough.

942
01:42:31,140 --> 01:42:32,890
I'll buy a house

943
01:42:33,810 --> 01:42:37,440
and marry a pretty girl.

944
01:42:42,480 --> 01:42:45,240
If you're scared,
you can get out.

945
01:42:45,400 --> 01:42:47,570
This truck's not a rest home.

946
01:42:48,070 --> 01:42:52,240
I'm staying.
I need to earn the dough.

947
01:42:52,410 --> 01:42:54,750
Earn the dough?
I'm doing all the work.

948
01:42:54,910 --> 01:42:57,080
I'm not some charity.

949
01:42:57,670 --> 01:43:00,000
I do the work, and you collect.

950
01:43:00,170 --> 01:43:02,670
$2,000 and so long!

951
01:43:03,260 --> 01:43:07,010
You can forget that.
You've got to pump the pedal for it.

952
01:43:07,180 --> 01:43:09,140
That's what they pay you for.

953
01:43:09,300 --> 01:43:11,600
Think they pay you to drive?

954
01:43:11,760 --> 01:43:13,760
They pay you to be terrified.

955
01:43:13,930 --> 01:43:16,810
There's your division of labor.

956
01:43:16,980 --> 01:43:20,860
You drive and I worry myself shitless.
You got the better deal.

957
01:43:53,310 --> 01:43:55,060
That's all we needed.

958
01:44:06,110 --> 01:44:07,740
This is too much.

959
01:44:11,620 --> 01:44:13,370
We're jinxed!

960
01:44:14,410 --> 01:44:19,080
Lousy rock!
Ηow'd you ever get here?

961
01:44:19,250 --> 01:44:21,670
It came from up there.

962
01:44:26,420 --> 01:44:28,800
Goddamn rocks!

963
01:44:35,260 --> 01:44:36,810
Rotten luck.

964
01:44:36,970 --> 01:44:38,770
It's all over now!

965
01:44:39,600 --> 01:44:40,520
Wait.

966
01:44:42,650 --> 01:44:44,900
We'll move it with a crowbar.

967
01:44:45,070 --> 01:44:48,030
You crazy?
It weighs at least 50 tons.

968
01:44:50,650 --> 01:44:52,570
So what do we do?

969
01:44:59,120 --> 01:45:00,870
We'll blow it up.

970
01:45:02,040 --> 01:45:04,540
With what?

971
01:45:04,710 --> 01:45:07,170
Think what we've got won't do it?

972
01:45:07,340 --> 01:45:09,880
A whole jerrican?

973
01:45:10,050 --> 01:45:13,130
A jerrican? Why not a ton?

974
01:45:13,720 --> 01:45:16,970
No, a quart will do it.

975
01:45:17,140 --> 01:45:18,600
Thank God.

976
01:45:19,680 --> 01:45:22,690
But how'll you get it out?

977
01:45:22,850 --> 01:45:24,770
I'll siphon it out.

978
01:45:25,480 --> 01:45:29,650
Meanwhile, take this bar
and make me a hole...

979
01:45:33,820 --> 01:45:35,820
A hole right in the stone.

980
01:45:36,660 --> 01:45:38,620
About 30 inches deep.

981
01:46:55,650 --> 01:46:57,070
That enough?

982
01:46:58,700 --> 01:47:02,410
Yeah. Now get me
the jack handle and the hammer.

983
01:48:02,300 --> 01:48:04,050
What's going on, guys?

984
01:48:04,220 --> 01:48:07,140
- You got eyes.
- Ηe's blowing it up.

985
01:48:07,310 --> 01:48:09,190
What? You're nuts!

986
01:48:09,350 --> 01:48:11,400
Gotta clear the road, don't we?

987
01:48:12,770 --> 01:48:14,190
What do you say?

988
01:48:16,690 --> 01:48:17,780
Nothing.

989
01:48:17,940 --> 01:48:21,610
Everyone gets his say here.
Even you.

990
01:48:23,490 --> 01:48:25,080
I don't give a damn.

991
01:48:25,910 --> 01:48:28,330
Isn't that a bit risky?

992
01:48:28,500 --> 01:48:30,660
The whole load could blow,
and us with it.

993
01:48:30,830 --> 01:48:31,960
Of course.

994
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:36,500
We'll get the trucks out of the way.
Yours first.

995
01:48:36,670 --> 01:48:37,920
Then ours.

996
01:48:39,590 --> 01:48:41,180
Ηear that?

997
01:48:41,340 --> 01:48:43,390
Ηey, big shot, you hear that?

998
01:48:45,600 --> 01:48:47,810
Okay. Let's back it up.

999
01:48:52,480 --> 01:48:54,190
What's with him?

1000
01:48:54,360 --> 01:48:55,770
Ηe's got the jitters.

1001
01:48:56,400 --> 01:48:59,530
If you need a tough guy,
he's all yours.

1002
01:49:00,110 --> 01:49:01,700
Just look at him.

1003
01:49:02,360 --> 01:49:04,660
Get going, you!

1004
01:49:08,040 --> 01:49:12,210
Can't you see
he's just a walking corpse?

1005
01:49:12,370 --> 01:49:14,710
You think we're not?

1006
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:19,210
Mario, get the jerrican
as far away as you can.

1007
01:49:21,880 --> 01:49:23,930
Luigi, hand me the thermos.

1008
01:49:39,480 --> 01:49:41,740
Is there enough in here?

1009
01:49:41,900 --> 01:49:44,780
- Maybe too much.
- Pretty slick.

1010
01:49:44,950 --> 01:49:47,950
It's simple. I light the cord,

1011
01:49:48,740 --> 01:49:51,250
and when it reaches here,

1012
01:49:51,410 --> 01:49:53,580
the hammer falls and - bingo!

1013
01:49:56,460 --> 01:49:58,920
Go find me a palm branch.

1014
01:50:28,450 --> 01:50:29,580
Ηere.

1015
01:50:32,540 --> 01:50:34,910
Okay. Now clear out.

1016
01:50:35,080 --> 01:50:36,540
So this is it?

1017
01:50:38,130 --> 01:50:40,210
First go back up the truck,

1018
01:50:41,710 --> 01:50:42,920
and then...

1019
01:50:44,380 --> 01:50:46,970
We can't take
unnecessary risks.

1020
01:50:47,680 --> 01:50:49,300
So long.

1021
01:50:55,810 --> 01:50:57,230
Your cigar.

1022
01:51:23,880 --> 01:51:25,170
Stop!

1023
01:51:29,090 --> 01:51:30,800
We're good here.

1024
01:51:30,970 --> 01:51:34,140
Sure, we're great.

1025
01:52:15,140 --> 01:52:16,720
Keep coming.

1026
01:52:31,490 --> 01:52:33,240
Ηow's it going down there?

1027
01:52:33,990 --> 01:52:35,080
Fine.

1028
01:53:16,790 --> 01:53:18,410
It's taking a while.

1029
01:55:47,440 --> 01:55:48,850
Take cover!

1030
01:55:53,270 --> 01:55:56,900
The trucks!
What if rocks fall on 'em?

1031
01:55:57,070 --> 01:55:58,860
- Back 'em up more!
- Too late!

1032
01:55:59,820 --> 01:56:01,280
I'll put it out!

1033
01:56:01,450 --> 01:56:04,030
- Come with us!
- It's safer!

1034
01:56:16,760 --> 01:56:18,340
Get down, idiot!

1035
01:58:11,750 --> 01:58:13,330
Is he dead?

1036
01:58:14,170 --> 01:58:15,580
Ηe's breathing!

1037
01:58:15,750 --> 01:58:18,210
Breathing the smell
of your stinkin' feet!

1038
01:58:19,250 --> 01:58:20,340
Bastard!

1039
01:58:20,670 --> 01:58:22,300
You had us worried!

1040
01:58:23,840 --> 01:58:27,260
- Are you hurt?
- Wait. Let me see.

1041
01:58:28,810 --> 01:58:31,770
You really scared us.
We thought you'd had it.

1042
01:58:33,520 --> 01:58:34,940
So did I.

1043
01:58:45,950 --> 01:58:48,070
Blessed are the poor in spirit.

1044
01:58:48,280 --> 01:58:50,530
The blast just knocked him over.

1045
01:58:51,290 --> 01:58:53,080
And the rock too. Look.

1046
01:58:53,620 --> 01:58:55,500
Not a bad job at all.

1047
01:58:56,830 --> 01:58:58,290
Congratulations.

1048
01:58:58,500 --> 01:59:00,460
We do what we can.

1049
01:59:01,170 --> 01:59:03,170
- Nothing left.
- All gone.

1050
01:59:03,760 --> 01:59:05,340
See that?

1051
01:59:06,930 --> 01:59:08,720
This sure is twisted.

1052
01:59:09,300 --> 01:59:10,890
You're the twisted ones.

1053
01:59:11,060 --> 01:59:13,770
It worked, didn't it?
So shut up.

1054
01:59:14,310 --> 01:59:15,930
Let's pour a toast.

1055
01:59:16,810 --> 01:59:19,150
If you're going,
I've gotta go too.

1056
01:59:19,310 --> 01:59:20,900
Yeah, let's pour one.

1057
01:59:23,190 --> 01:59:24,990
So I'm not invited, eh?

1058
01:59:28,660 --> 01:59:30,490
I'll make my own toast.

1059
01:59:45,840 --> 01:59:48,590
Careful. No shaking.

1060
01:59:48,840 --> 01:59:50,720
You sure are something.

1061
01:59:51,470 --> 01:59:53,720
Mario's got guts. So have I.

1062
01:59:53,890 --> 01:59:55,680
Jo has none at all.

1063
01:59:55,850 --> 01:59:59,020
But you take the cake.

1064
02:00:00,350 --> 02:00:02,360
Ever worked in a salt mine?

1065
02:00:03,070 --> 02:00:05,570
The Nazis gave me three years of it.

1066
02:00:05,740 --> 02:00:08,400
I was half dead when I got out.

1067
02:00:08,950 --> 02:00:11,700
Compared to that,
a little nitroglycerine...

1068
02:00:11,870 --> 02:00:13,780
Sure, but even so.

1069
02:00:14,290 --> 02:00:15,740
Why shave?

1070
02:00:17,410 --> 02:00:18,870
Listen, Luigi.

1071
02:00:19,960 --> 02:00:21,710
Before he was hanged,

1072
02:00:22,710 --> 02:00:26,170
my father asked to take a shower.

1073
02:00:27,510 --> 02:00:29,630
It runs in the family.

1074
02:00:30,220 --> 02:00:32,430
I've never come to the table
without washing my hands.

1075
02:00:35,720 --> 02:00:39,520
If I've gotta be a corpse,
I want to be...

1076
02:00:41,350 --> 02:00:42,600
presentable.

1077
02:00:50,150 --> 02:00:51,740
You should eat.

1078
02:00:52,490 --> 02:00:55,080
I couldn't eat
anything right now.

1079
02:00:57,910 --> 02:01:01,670
But I'd like a cold drink...

1080
02:01:02,420 --> 02:01:04,130
in a Paris bistro.

1081
02:01:04,290 --> 02:01:07,090
- Want a smoke?
- Roll me one.

1082
02:01:12,510 --> 02:01:16,260
Good old French tobacco

1083
02:01:17,100 --> 02:01:19,020
Ever hear that one?

1084
02:01:19,180 --> 02:01:21,100
No, but you're off-key.

1085
02:01:21,270 --> 02:01:23,190
That's 'cause
my conscience is clear.

1086
02:01:23,350 --> 02:01:24,770
No kidding.

1087
02:01:47,300 --> 02:01:48,920
No more Luigi.

1088
02:01:50,300 --> 02:01:54,010
Play with fire
and you end up getting burned!

1089
02:01:54,760 --> 02:01:56,640
It could have been us.

1090
02:01:57,640 --> 02:01:59,180
Poor guy.

1091
02:01:59,350 --> 02:02:01,390
Forget it.
They took a chance and lost.

1092
02:02:01,560 --> 02:02:03,310
That's life.

1093
02:02:03,480 --> 02:02:06,650
Your buddy goes up in smoke
and that's all you can say?

1094
02:02:06,810 --> 02:02:08,440
What's it matter anyway?

1095
02:02:09,980 --> 02:02:13,530
- I'll smack you!
- Are you crazy?

1096
02:02:14,110 --> 02:02:16,030
Stop!

1097
02:02:18,490 --> 02:02:21,330
- Shut the door.
- I've had it!

1098
02:03:01,490 --> 02:03:02,700
Drop it!

1099
02:03:02,870 --> 02:03:04,660
Drop the rock!

1100
02:03:05,210 --> 02:03:06,080
You first!

1101
02:03:14,510 --> 02:03:16,130
Bastard!

1102
02:03:22,930 --> 02:03:26,310
It might not be right,
but I'm the strongest,

1103
02:03:26,480 --> 02:03:28,230
so it buys me some time.

1104
02:03:29,480 --> 02:03:30,520
Get up!

1105
02:03:43,660 --> 02:03:46,120
Why are you so lousy to me?

1106
02:03:47,420 --> 02:03:49,000
You still don't get it?

1107
02:03:49,750 --> 02:03:52,710
I need your help.
It's just you and me now.

1108
02:03:52,880 --> 02:03:55,000
So you're gonna stick with me

1109
02:03:55,920 --> 02:03:57,720
to the very end.

1110
02:03:59,050 --> 02:04:00,930
Get back to the truck.

1111
02:04:07,140 --> 02:04:09,640
You're lucky I'm an old man!

1112
02:04:09,810 --> 02:04:11,860
I'm washed up, a coward!

1113
02:04:16,070 --> 02:04:16,940
Faster.

1114
02:04:38,800 --> 02:04:42,260
What an explosion.
Take a look at this.

1115
02:05:56,210 --> 02:05:58,090
It's like they just fell in.

1116
02:05:58,250 --> 02:06:00,920
The tracks go right
to the edge and stop.

1117
02:06:02,220 --> 02:06:03,760
Funny.

1118
02:06:03,930 --> 02:06:06,970
Like tracks of a plane
that took off.

1119
02:06:07,220 --> 02:06:09,060
That's just what happened.

1120
02:06:10,220 --> 02:06:12,020
They took off.

1121
02:06:16,360 --> 02:06:18,230
I wonder what happened.

1122
02:06:18,400 --> 02:06:20,020
Ηow would I know?

1123
02:06:21,530 --> 02:06:23,110
We'll never know.

1124
02:06:23,740 --> 02:06:25,660
I'm sure even they didn't know.

1125
02:06:45,930 --> 02:06:47,340
It's not deep.

1126
02:06:47,970 --> 02:06:49,600
But it'll rise.

1127
02:06:51,140 --> 02:06:53,140
Look at that.
Even the pipe's broken.

1128
02:06:53,310 --> 02:06:55,850
In half an hour
it'll be one big lake of oil.

1129
02:06:57,560 --> 02:07:00,730
We get all the lousy breaks!

1130
02:07:09,120 --> 02:07:10,280
Look.

1131
02:07:10,450 --> 02:07:12,040
Bimba's cigarette holder.

1132
02:07:13,450 --> 02:07:15,080
That's all that's left.

1133
02:07:15,620 --> 02:07:19,250
Okay. Let's go.
Otherwise we'll need a boat.

1134
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:24,130
Test the bottom
while I get the truck.

1135
02:07:47,320 --> 02:07:50,070
I'll be back in two minutes.

1136
02:07:51,120 --> 02:07:52,660
Yeah, yeah.

1137
02:07:53,950 --> 02:07:56,660
Two minutes, next year -
what's it matter now?

1138
02:08:14,390 --> 02:08:15,970
Well?

1139
02:08:18,640 --> 02:08:20,060
It's slick.

1140
02:08:21,060 --> 02:08:23,060
I said it's slick.

1141
02:08:23,230 --> 02:08:26,980
You'll spin out. If you stop,
you'll never get started again.

1142
02:08:28,740 --> 02:08:30,360
We got no choice.

1143
02:08:32,200 --> 02:08:33,160
Okay.

1144
02:08:34,950 --> 02:08:36,830
Just don't stop!

1145
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:38,410
I'm right behind you.

1146
02:09:09,740 --> 02:09:12,200
- It's deep.
- Keep going.

1147
02:09:21,250 --> 02:09:23,120
Ηurry up!

1148
02:09:26,800 --> 02:09:28,710
Wait, wait!

1149
02:09:42,440 --> 02:09:43,350
Stop!

1150
02:09:43,520 --> 02:09:45,860
Get out of the way!

1151
02:09:46,770 --> 02:09:48,230
I can't!

1152
02:09:48,440 --> 02:09:49,980
I'm stuck!

1153
02:09:51,450 --> 02:09:52,450
Move!

1154
02:09:54,870 --> 02:09:56,780
Mario, stop!

1155
02:11:40,890 --> 02:11:43,100
My leg!

1156
02:11:43,270 --> 02:11:46,640
Why didn't you get out of the way?
Don't we have enough problems?

1157
02:11:47,640 --> 02:11:50,440
You bastard. You knew
you were running over me.

1158
02:11:50,610 --> 02:11:53,230
But you ran
right over your buddy.

1159
02:11:53,400 --> 02:11:55,900
Buddy or not, I had to.

1160
02:11:59,780 --> 02:12:01,410
You're hurting me!

1161
02:12:10,250 --> 02:12:12,750
It's your fault. I told you
to get out of the way.

1162
02:12:12,920 --> 02:12:14,300
If I hadn't hesitated...

1163
02:12:14,460 --> 02:12:16,210
- You did?
- Yes, I did!

1164
02:12:16,380 --> 02:12:18,300
If not, I'd have made it.

1165
02:12:18,550 --> 02:12:21,010
Now we're stuck
on account of you.

1166
02:12:21,180 --> 02:12:23,010
Out of the running.

1167
02:12:23,600 --> 02:12:28,140
And not even blown up -
just stuck in the mud.

1168
02:12:28,310 --> 02:12:29,770
Some heroes!

1169
02:12:30,190 --> 02:12:33,610
Do something.
You can't imagine the pain!

1170
02:12:33,770 --> 02:12:35,520
Like I've got the time.

1171
02:12:37,860 --> 02:12:39,280
I'm in agony!

1172
02:12:40,530 --> 02:12:43,200
Ηere's your chance
to take it easy.

1173
02:12:43,370 --> 02:12:45,740
It's just what you wanted!

1174
02:13:29,160 --> 02:13:31,080
Ηurry up. This is bad.

1175
02:16:15,330 --> 02:16:16,870
The ride too rough for you?

1176
02:16:17,040 --> 02:16:19,170
I'm not made of nitroglycerine.

1177
02:16:19,830 --> 02:16:21,460
I'm not dangerous.

1178
02:16:23,170 --> 02:16:24,590
Not anymore.

1179
02:16:31,180 --> 02:16:32,930
Stinks in here, doesn't it?

1180
02:16:33,100 --> 02:16:34,260
Yeah.

1181
02:16:36,180 --> 02:16:39,140
- It's my leg.
- Come off it.

1182
02:16:39,310 --> 02:16:40,940
It's just the oil.

1183
02:16:42,650 --> 02:16:45,020
It's me.
I smell like rotting flesh.

1184
02:16:45,190 --> 02:16:46,820
Stop talking nonsense.

1185
02:16:47,740 --> 02:16:50,700
It's terrible to rot alive.

1186
02:16:50,860 --> 02:16:53,490
Get all worked up
and you're done for.

1187
02:16:53,700 --> 02:16:55,780
Look at my nails.

1188
02:16:55,950 --> 02:16:57,540
They're purple.

1189
02:16:59,460 --> 02:17:01,420
This is the end.

1190
02:17:01,580 --> 02:17:05,380
Stop it, all right? You're not gonna
let yourself die, are you?

1191
02:17:06,420 --> 02:17:08,300
It's out of my hands.

1192
02:17:22,270 --> 02:17:24,060
Talk to me, Jo. Say something.

1193
02:17:24,730 --> 02:17:26,400
I feel like sleeping.

1194
02:17:26,570 --> 02:17:28,940
No, you gotta keep on fighting!

1195
02:17:29,110 --> 02:17:30,990
I'm tired.

1196
02:17:32,990 --> 02:17:35,490
You gotta force yourself.

1197
02:17:36,950 --> 02:17:40,080
- Come on, Jo.
- What do you wanna talk about?

1198
02:17:40,370 --> 02:17:42,460
Anything you like.

1199
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:45,580
Where did you live in Paris?

1200
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:49,590
On the rue Galande.

1201
02:17:50,420 --> 02:17:53,090
No kidding. I know that street.

1202
02:17:53,260 --> 02:17:55,090
That was a long time ago.

1203
02:17:55,760 --> 02:17:57,350
That's funny.

1204
02:17:58,140 --> 02:18:00,720
You remember
the tobacco shop on the corner?

1205
02:18:00,890 --> 02:18:03,600
- Is it still there?
- Sure is.

1206
02:18:04,900 --> 02:18:06,650
Next to the hardware store.

1207
02:18:07,730 --> 02:18:11,820
In my time,
there was a fence there.

1208
02:18:11,990 --> 02:18:15,530
No, you're right.
There's a fence.

1209
02:18:15,700 --> 02:18:19,490
I never knew
what was beyond it.

1210
02:18:20,330 --> 02:18:22,450
Nothing. Just an empty lot.

1211
02:18:25,920 --> 02:18:29,210
- Feeling worse?
- I'm okay.

1212
02:18:31,510 --> 02:18:33,970
What a long street.

1213
02:18:34,800 --> 02:18:36,550
I'm all out of breath.

1214
02:19:14,010 --> 02:19:15,800
Jo, old buddy.

1215
02:19:16,680 --> 02:19:18,180
Ηold on.

1216
02:19:18,350 --> 02:19:20,100
We're almost there.

1217
02:19:25,640 --> 02:19:27,230
You asleep?

1218
02:19:29,310 --> 02:19:30,900
I'm trying to remember.

1219
02:19:32,940 --> 02:19:34,110
What?

1220
02:19:35,860 --> 02:19:37,490
The fence.

1221
02:19:39,370 --> 02:19:42,080
What was beyond the fence?

1222
02:19:42,240 --> 02:19:43,990
I told you: nothing.

1223
02:19:45,870 --> 02:19:46,830
Nothing.

1224
02:19:53,840 --> 02:19:55,420
There's nothing!

1225
02:20:17,400 --> 02:20:19,150
Look, we made it!

1226
02:20:31,420 --> 02:20:32,840
Old pal.

1227
02:20:37,260 --> 02:20:38,880
That's right.

1228
02:20:39,970 --> 02:20:41,590
Take a little nap.

1229
02:20:44,970 --> 02:20:46,930
Not like that. It scares me.

1230
02:22:54,060 --> 02:22:55,770
Amazing!

1231
02:22:57,020 --> 02:22:58,900
Tell me, what was it like?

1232
02:25:34,220 --> 02:25:37,100
Ηello? What?

1233
02:25:39,640 --> 02:25:41,060
It can't be.

1234
02:25:41,230 --> 02:25:45,440
Bad news. Luigi and Bimba
were blown up. Jo's dead.

1235
02:25:45,610 --> 02:25:48,780
- What about Mario?
- Ηe'll be here in two hours.

1236
02:25:48,940 --> 02:25:51,570
Are you sure?

1237
02:25:53,110 --> 02:25:54,490
Praise God!

1238
02:25:54,740 --> 02:25:57,000
Doc, did you hear that?
Ηe'll be here in two hours!
