00:13:20,868 --> 00:13:22,368
Someone make him understand!!!

186
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:25,410
Hey, James Bond, make him understand!! hmm

187
00:13:25,725 --> 00:13:28,325
Take off your pants, or they're gonna piss on you

188
00:13:28,351 --> 00:13:30,352
Oye English!!! Feeling shy to speak in Hindi huh?

189
00:13:30,487 --> 00:13:33,987
Sorry sir I was born in Uganda, and studied in Pondicherry!!

190
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:35,751
So little slow in Hindi!!!

191
00:13:35,843 --> 00:13:39,342
So slowly make him understand!! Who is in a hurry here?

192
00:13:41,135 --> 00:13:42,454
Worn again huh?

193
00:13:43,436 --> 00:13:50,436
[in pure Hindi!!!!laughing stock] take off your pants or they're gonna piss on you...

194
00:13:50,819 --> 00:13:53,620
He is telling piss as Muthravisarjan??? hahahha

195
00:13:53,711 --> 00:13:56,732
Ooh here come pandit learning engineering

196
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:03,386
Hey come out you idiot

197
00:14:03,778 --> 00:14:05,279
Come out

198
00:14:10,503 --> 00:14:16,823
Come out or else I'll piss on your door!!!

199
00:14:24,827 --> 00:14:26,226
I'll count till 10

200
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,518
if you don't come out

201
00:14:29,051 --> 00:14:33,652
I'll piss on your door for the whole semester

202
00:16:27,364 --> 00:16:30,465
Salt water is a great conductor of electricity

203
00:16:30,536 --> 00:16:31,956
8th standard physics

204
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:33,410
We all studied it!!

205
00:16:33,501 --> 00:16:35,821
He applied it!!

206
00:16:38,903 --> 00:16:43,123
ICE's director's name was Dr.Viru Shastrabhuddi

207
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:45,035
But every one calls him Virus

208
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,500
All called him Computer Virus!!!

209
00:16:46,574 --> 00:16:48,995
Oye Virus is comin, carrying eggs with him

210
00:16:49,307 --> 00:16:52,507
He has said first years to come down come fast

211
00:16:52,752 --> 00:16:55,451
Virus was the most competetive man we had ever seen

212
00:16:55,646 --> 00:16:58,147
If someone overtakes him even one step.

213
00:16:58,167 --> 00:17:00,487
He couldn't accept it,

214
00:17:02,761 --> 00:17:06,261
To save time he used velcro instead of buttons

215
00:17:06,288 --> 00:17:08,309
And a hook in tie!

216
00:17:10,694 --> 00:17:12,014
He has trained his mind

217
00:17:12,517 --> 00:17:15,317
That he can write using both his hands at the same time

218
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:23,499
Everday at 2 he used to take a power nap of exactly 7.5 minutes
and used to listen opera

219
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:33,871
Govind had to do all unproductive works like shaving, cutting nails in this 7.5 mins

220
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:51,436
What is this?

221
00:17:51,447 --> 00:17:52,548
Sir, a nest!!

222
00:17:52,597 --> 00:17:53,717
whose??

223
00:17:53,741 --> 00:17:55,061
cuckoo bird's nest

224
00:17:57,157 --> 00:17:59,756
Cuckoo bird never builds a nest.

225
00:17:59,855 --> 00:18:02,953
They lay their eggs on other birds nest

226
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:07,872
And when their babies come to the world, what do they do first?

227
00:18:08,313 --> 00:18:14,313
They kick out other eggs from the nest...

228
00:18:16,988 --> 00:18:19,009
Competition over

229
00:18:19,819 --> 00:18:22,119
The life begins with murder

230
00:18:22,633 --> 00:18:24,153
That's nature...

231
00:18:24,439 --> 00:18:25,560
Compete

232
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,579
Or die!

233
00:18:28,551 --> 00:18:31,551
You all so are like the cuckoo birds

234
00:18:34,909 --> 00:18:39,228
And these are those eggs whom you kicked out and reached ICE

235
00:18:39,308 --> 00:18:40,808
Don't forget

236
00:18:40,872 --> 00:18:44,294
Because every year, 4 lakh applications comes to ICE

237
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:47,409
Among them only 200 will be selected

238
00:18:47,931 --> 00:18:49,051
You

239
00:18:49,142 --> 00:18:50,342
And these

240
00:18:50,349 --> 00:18:51,748
Finished

241
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:53,998
Broken eggs!!

242
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:58,739
My own son applied for 3 years

243
00:19:00,263 --> 00:19:01,463
Rejected

244
00:19:01,518 --> 00:19:02,918
Everytime

245
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:06,950
Remember life is a race!!

246
00:19:07,381 --> 00:19:10,702
If you don't run fast someone will beat you and move faster than you...

247
00:19:10,778 --> 00:19:13,179
Let me tell you very interesting story

248
00:19:14,973 --> 00:19:17,072
This is an astronauts pen

249
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,954
In space, fountain pen, ball pen cannot be used

250
00:19:21,036 --> 00:19:22,957
So after spending millions of dollars

251
00:19:22,998 --> 00:19:25,098
Scientists invented this pen!

252
00:19:25,495 --> 00:19:29,495
With this you can write in any angle, any temperature, zero gravity

253
00:19:29,856 --> 00:19:33,378
One day when I was a student, the director of our institute called me

254
00:19:33,734 --> 00:19:35,833
He said "Viru Shastrabhuddi." I said "yes sir"

255
00:19:35,846 --> 00:19:37,665
Come here!! I got scared

256
00:19:38,795 --> 00:19:40,414
He showed me this pen

257
00:19:41,399 --> 00:19:44,200
He said this is a symbol of excellence

258
00:19:45,007 --> 00:19:46,408
I give it to you

259
00:19:47,362 --> 00:19:51,762
And the day when you get a extraordinary student like you

260
00:19:52,383 --> 00:19:54,083
Pass this pen to him

261
00:19:54,497 --> 00:19:59,617
For 32 years Viru Shastrabhuddi is waiting for the next Viru Shastrabhuddi

262
00:20:02,622 --> 00:20:05,121
Anyone here in this batch to honour this pen?

263
00:20:07,883 --> 00:20:10,103
Good, hands down

264
00:20:13,547 --> 00:20:15,646
Should I write on the notice board?

265
00:20:15,646 --> 00:20:16,746
I said put down your hands

266
00:20:16,907 --> 00:20:19,007
Sir I have a question sir...

267
00:20:19,477 --> 00:20:27,098
If in space fountain pen, ball pen don't work
why astronauts didn't try pencil?

268
00:20:27,292 --> 00:20:29,691
Could've saved millions of dollars

269
00:20:41,614 --> 00:20:43,714
I will get back to you on this

270
00:20:46,971 --> 00:20:48,792
That fellow kicks seniors
And irritates the director

271
00:20:48,811 --> 00:20:52,211
I'm telling you if we stay with him...
He will put us in trouble

272
00:20:52,222 --> 00:20:54,521
Buddy, your thought screwed Virus completely

273
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:56,586
Oh Emperor, you're great.

274
00:20:56,956 --> 00:20:58,776
Accept our gift...

275
00:20:58,844 --> 00:21:00,764
Get lost, don't you have school?

276
00:21:01,156 --> 00:21:02,756
Who'll pay fees? Your father?

277
00:21:02,766 --> 00:21:04,586
You're naming my father?

278
00:21:04,633 --> 00:21:05,753
Hey stop! Stop Raju, what are you doing?

279
00:21:05,894 --> 00:21:07,294
Eh listen!

280
00:21:07,373 --> 00:21:09,774
No fees required for schooling!!! Uniform is required, uniform...

281
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:13,009
Whichever school you like go, get the uniform of that school.

282
00:21:13,669 --> 00:21:15,489
Go sit in the class...

283
00:21:15,543 --> 00:21:17,442
Who'll come to know when there is a huge population???

284
00:21:17,502 --> 00:21:19,123
If I get caught?

285
00:21:19,199 --> 00:21:21,199
If they catch you, then change uniform, school! ehhe

286
00:21:21,232 --> 00:21:23,052
There was really something special about him,

287
00:21:23,149 --> 00:21:26,650
He always used to challenge everything in the world, each and every move...

288
00:21:26,693 --> 00:21:29,693
He was the only one free bird in VIRUS's nest...

289
00:21:29,731 --> 00:21:33,230
We all were just robots operated by professors remote control...

290
00:21:33,239 --> 00:21:35,339
But he was the only one.

291
00:21:35,421 --> 00:21:37,522
Perhaps not a machine!!!!

292
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:39,351
What is a machine?

293
00:21:43,603 --> 00:21:45,722
why are you smiling??

294
00:21:45,874 --> 00:21:49,595
Um, actually sir
From my childhood I used to dream of studying in an engineering college

295
00:21:49,659 --> 00:21:52,459
Today I'm sitting over here, feeling excited sir!!!

296
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:56,791
No need to be so overexcited...
Tell me the definition for machine

297
00:21:57,168 --> 00:21:58,288
Um...

298
00:21:58,413 --> 00:21:59,533
Sir

299
00:21:59,552 --> 00:22:01,751
Machine is anything that reduces human effort sir

300
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:03,911
Will you please elaborate...?

301
00:22:06,506 --> 00:22:07,606
Sir um...

302
00:22:07,615 --> 00:22:11,814
All those things which makes the work for humans easier are machines sir

303
00:22:12,651 --> 00:22:16,952
Feeling hot!!! Pressed button, wind blowing, FAN is a machine sir!!

304
00:22:16,996 --> 00:22:20,996
You can talk to your friend  miles away. TELEPHONE is machine sir!!!

305
00:22:21,069 --> 00:22:24,569
Calculate crores in less time... CALCULATOR is a machine sir

306
00:22:24,726 --> 00:22:26,827
Sir, actually we are dependent in the world of machines sir

307
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:30,020
From PEN NIB to PANTS ZIB... all machines sir!!

308
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:32,880
One sec up one sec down, up down up down up

309
00:22:34,215 --> 00:22:36,236
Tell me the definition??

310
00:22:36,553 --> 00:22:38,653
Sir that's what I'm telling sir.

311
00:22:39,384 --> 00:22:41,384
Will you write all these in exams huh?

312
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:43,911
"This is machine up down up down up"??

313
00:22:44,004 --> 00:22:45,405
IDIOT!!!

314
00:22:45,421 --> 00:22:47,241

Great. Please sit down!

324
00:23:11,269 --> 00:23:13,089
Thank you. Thank you

325
00:23:13,185 --> 00:23:16,485
But sir even I said the same in simple language...

326
00:23:16,551 --> 00:23:20,052
If you like simple language.
You can go join some other arts and commerce college

327
00:23:20,097 --> 00:23:22,396
But sir, we should understand it at least

328
00:23:22,409 --> 00:23:25,510
Mugging up from books like this, what's the use sir?

329
00:23:25,543 --> 00:23:27,563
Oh you know more than books???

330
00:23:27,936 --> 00:23:32,136
Book has the same definition...
And if you wanna pass, you'll write this.

331
00:23:32,146 --> 00:23:33,847
But sir, ther are other books also

332
00:23:33,925 --> 00:23:35,325
Get out!!!

333
00:23:35,418 --> 00:23:36,517
Oh why?

334
00:23:36,695 --> 00:23:39,695
In simple language... please go outside...

335
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:48,830
IDIOT!

336
00:23:50,816 --> 00:23:53,616
So we were discussing about the machines

337
00:23:53,803 --> 00:23:55,823
Hey, why do you come back?

338
00:23:55,966 --> 00:23:57,787
I forgot something sir!

339
00:23:58,662 --> 00:23:59,782
What?

340
00:23:59,849 --> 00:24:03,770
Instruments to record, analyse, summarize, organize,
debate and explain information,

341
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:07,374
that are elastative and non-elastative, hard bound paper,
bag jacketed, non-jacketed

342
00:24:07,382 --> 00:24:10,382
with forward introduction, table of cotents index, that are
intented for the enlightment, understanding

343
00:24:10,396 --> 00:24:15,117
enhancement and education of human brains, of sense
in root of vision, sometimes touch!!

344
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,881
What are you saying?

345
00:24:22,103 --> 00:24:24,024
My books sir,

346
00:24:24,557 --> 00:24:26,956
I forgot my books sir,
can I take them?

347
00:24:26,999 --> 00:24:28,698
Couldn't you say in simple way?

348
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:32,232
I tried simple before, but you didn't like that way sir...

349
00:24:37,093 --> 00:24:40,713
Professors used to keep Rancho outside more often than in classroom

350
00:24:40,713 --> 00:24:44,213
If he got kicked from one class, he'd go to another

351
00:24:44,218 --> 00:24:48,318
Rancho used to say that knowledge is increasing everywhere
wherever you get... gain it!!!

352
00:24:48,412 --> 00:24:50,513
He was entirely different from all of us

353
00:24:50,607 --> 00:24:52,706
We used to fight for bathroom

354
00:24:52,784 --> 00:24:56,284
But wherever Rancho found water, he had bath there itself!

355
00:24:57,677 --> 00:24:59,777
He was very much attached to machines

356
00:24:59,844 --> 00:25:01,946
Used to carry a screwdriver in his pocket wherever he went

357
00:25:02,015 --> 00:25:05,014
He would open any machine that he found.... some got closed

358
00:25:06,126 --> 00:25:08,146
Some did not!!

359
00:25:08,186 --> 00:25:10,987
There was another guy just like him

360
00:25:13,729 --> 00:25:15,049
Joy Lobo

361
00:25:15,355 --> 00:25:17,174
Sir, excuse me sir

362
00:25:17,997 --> 00:25:19,398
Mr.Joy Lobo

363
00:25:19,696 --> 00:25:22,496
Sir, if you mind letting me know about the convocations dates...

364
00:25:22,501 --> 00:25:23,421
Why?

365
00:25:23,479 --> 00:25:25,479
Actually dad wanted to get a reservation

366
00:25:25,505 --> 00:25:28,805
I'm the first engineer in my village sir.
All the relatives wanted to come on the convocation day

367
00:25:28,954 --> 00:25:32,154
In that case call make a phone call to your dad

368
00:25:32,161 --> 00:25:34,581
Son please, please don't waste my time, hurry

369
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:41,249
Hello

370
00:25:41,259 --> 00:25:44,578
Dad, director sir will speak to you

371
00:25:44,988 --> 00:25:46,108
Joy

372
00:25:46,121 --> 00:25:48,922
Mr.Lobo, your son won't get graduated this year

373
00:25:48,966 --> 00:25:50,086
What happened sir?

374
00:25:50,565 --> 00:25:52,665
He has violated all the deadlines

375
00:25:52,665 --> 00:25:56,685
With unrealistic... Mr.Lobo, Mr.Lobo...
unrealistic project, as I said already

376
00:25:56,696 --> 00:25:58,517
He's making some non-sense helicopter

377
00:25:58,593 --> 00:26:03,592
Wo I recommend you not to reserve his ticket, I'm so sorry

378
00:26:05,161 --> 00:26:06,481
Sir I'm just close

379
00:26:06,513 --> 00:26:08,334
Is your project ready?

380
00:26:08,464 --> 00:26:09,584
Is your project ready?

381
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:11,659
Sir at least take a look at this once sir please

382
00:26:11,707 --> 00:26:13,667
Submit it. I'll take into consideration

383
00:26:13,683 --> 00:26:15,704
Sir give me some extension sir
Why should I give you an extension?

384
00:26:15,788 --> 00:26:18,788
Sir after dads stroke I couldn't concentrate for 2 months sir please

385
00:26:18,861 --> 00:26:20,561
Did you run out of food and water for 2 months?

386
00:26:20,615 --> 00:26:21,735
No

387
00:26:21,737 --> 00:26:23,836
You couldn't take a bath? No?

388
00:26:23,909 --> 00:26:25,109
Then why did you left studies?

389
00:26:25,174 --> 00:26:27,775
I'm very close sir pls take a look at this sir please..

390
00:26:27,854 --> 00:26:31,354
Mr.Lobo, my son died falling from train on Sunday afternoon

391
00:26:31,433 --> 00:26:37,053
Monday morning Viru Shastrabhuddi gave lecture in this college
so don't tell me that non-sense

392
00:26:38,713 --> 00:26:42,113
I can only give you sympathy not extension

393
00:26:42,922 --> 00:26:44,042
si...r

394
00:28:01,463 --> 00:28:05,464
How cool design he made? Wireless camera over helicopter?

395
00:28:07,027 --> 00:28:09,827
Traffic updates security... can be used for all

396
00:28:09,831 --> 00:28:12,932
but VIRUS was telling this is an impractical design...
Won't fly it seems?

397
00:28:13,013 --> 00:28:15,113
How it won't fly? I'll make it fly!! hm hm

398
00:28:17,316 --> 00:28:19,535
Hey don't tell Joy will give him surprise

399
00:28:19,619 --> 00:28:23,021
we'll make this fly out his window and record his reaction

400
00:28:23,088 --> 00:28:25,408
If we do his project, who'll do ours?

401
00:28:25,503 --> 00:28:28,202
Test, viva, quizzes included, there are 42 exams in each semester

402
00:28:28,276 --> 00:28:30,295
Hey you worry a lot dude

403
00:28:31,175 --> 00:28:33,877
Take this hand and keep it in your hand and say,

404
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:35,490
Aal iz well, aal iz well

405
00:28:35,554 --> 00:28:36,953
Aal iz well

406
00:28:37,013 --> 00:28:37,913
Aal iz well

407
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:40,610
Now he has brought something new our BABA Ranchhodas!!

408
00:28:41,025 --> 00:28:48,446
Hey in our village there was a watchman...
he used to yell in night saying aal iz well

409
00:28:48,493 --> 00:28:50,593
And we used to sleep tight

410
00:28:50,925 --> 00:28:54,425
One night there was a robbery in our village,
then we came to know that he's blind,

411
00:28:54,461 --> 00:28:56,960
And he yells aal iz well, aal iz well

412
00:28:57,056 --> 00:28:59,156
And we used to sleep like fools...

413
00:28:59,847 --> 00:29:01,948
But that day we came to  know about the real fact

414
00:29:01,979 --> 00:29:04,599
See our heart right, is a big coward...

415
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:07,759
Keep our heart as a fool

416
00:29:07,849 --> 00:29:09,849
If you have any big problem in life

417
00:29:09,947 --> 00:29:10,647
Tell our heart

418
00:29:10,728 --> 00:29:14,248
No problem baby everything is ok
aal iz well, aal iz well

419
00:29:14,389 --> 00:29:16,688
Hmm so that will solve problem? huh?

420
00:29:16,791 --> 00:29:19,310
No but still it gains the dareness to survive

421
00:29:20,795 --> 00:29:24,696
Remember this mantra... this is gonna become more  useful over here

422
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,820
Got it, got it yeah

423
00:32:57,859 --> 00:32:59,678
Take it to Joy's window

424
00:32:59,857 --> 00:33:00,977
Hey Joy, up up

425
00:33:01,694 --> 00:33:04,415
Oye window... see Silencer naked naked heheh ehhe

426
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:09,450
Hey Joy come out Joy

427
00:33:12,053 --> 00:33:13,173
Hey Joy look outside..

428
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:16,044
Joy....

429
00:33:49,528 --> 00:33:56,549
#... give me some sunshine.. give me some rain...#

430
00:33:58,293 --> 00:34:05,193
#... give me another chance I wanna  grow up once again.....#

431
00:34:05,337 --> 00:34:07,157
You've a good news sir..

432
00:34:07,327 --> 00:34:08,947
Neither police got to know

433
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:11,357
Nor Joy's dad....

434
00:34:12,017 --> 00:34:14,118
Everyone will think it's a suicide, sir

435
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:18,100
Reason for death in postmortem report

436
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:21,790
Intense pressure in wind pipe resulting in choking

437
00:34:23,248 --> 00:34:25,167
This fool believed that

438
00:34:25,222 --> 00:34:27,343
He died because of the pressure here...

439
00:34:28,028 --> 00:34:31,428
And from the last 4 years of pressure over here? What about that?

440
00:34:31,436 --> 00:34:34,236
Even that's not in the report also sir,

441
00:34:35,078 --> 00:34:37,677
These engineers are so back minded sir

442
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:42,901
Didn't even invent some machine, that could really behold the pressure over here...

443
00:34:44,064 --> 00:34:49,065
If they had does, could've come to know this is not a suicide, it's a murder,

444
00:34:52,106 --> 00:34:56,225
Are you blaming me for the suicide of Joy?

445
00:34:56,236 --> 00:34:59,457
If one student can't tolerate pressure why I'm I the one responsible?

446
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:01,460
So much pressure will come in life...

447
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:03,430
Then everytime you'll blame others for that?

448
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:05,810
Sir I'm not blaming you sir

449
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:07,912
Actually I'm blaming the system

450
00:35:07,935 --> 00:35:10,235
Sir I've got some statistics

451
00:35:10,579 --> 00:35:12,679
Sir, in suicides India is no:1 sir

452
00:35:12,761 --> 00:35:15,982
Every half-hour a student attempts suicide, sir

453
00:35:17,116 --> 00:35:20,935
Students die less in sickness and more in suicide here sir

454
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:22,439
Something is going wrong right sir?

455
00:35:22,492 --> 00:35:26,892
I can't tell about other colleges but this is one of the finest colleges in the country

456
00:35:27,117 --> 00:35:29,918
I'm running this college for 32 years

457
00:35:30,014 --> 00:35:33,034
I brought this college to no:1 from 28th position

458
00:35:33,436 --> 00:35:35,656
Sir what no:1 sir ???

459
00:35:35,934 --> 00:35:39,634
Here we don't have any talks related to new ideas,
no talks on inventions

460
00:35:40,759 --> 00:35:45,978
Only great talk on marks, or else job in USA

461
00:35:46,832 --> 00:35:48,932
We don't gain any knowledge here sir...

462
00:35:49,007 --> 00:35:51,827
Here they only teach us how to bring good marks...

463
00:35:51,895 --> 00:35:54,696
Now are you going to teach me how to take a class?

464
00:36:16,889 --> 00:36:18,709
Please sit down

465
00:36:20,787 --> 00:36:22,807
Today we have our great leader behind us

466
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:26,971
Who claims that he can teach better than our highly qualified teachers

467
00:36:27,716 --> 00:36:32,215
So today our professor Ranchhodas Chanchad will teach us engineering

468
00:36:49,245 --> 00:36:51,465
We don't have all day

469
00:37:26,446 --> 00:37:28,266
You all have 30 secs

470
00:37:28,326 --> 00:37:30,946
Should find the meaning of the word written on the board

471
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:33,820
If you want you can make use of your books too

472
00:37:33,897 --> 00:37:36,698
The one who gets the answer can lift your hands up

473
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:39,689
We'll see who'll come first and who's last

474
00:37:41,134 --> 00:37:42,955
Your time starts now

475
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:13,119
Time up

476
00:38:15,731 --> 00:38:17,551
Time up sir, time up

477
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:19,780
What?

478
00:38:19,803 --> 00:38:21,623
Nobody got the answer?

479
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:26,371
Now rewind 1 min of life a bit and think

480
00:38:27,178 --> 00:38:28,878
When I asked this question.

481
00:38:29,339 --> 00:38:33,339
Anybody thought that today we will learn something new?

482
00:38:33,788 --> 00:38:35,987
Anyone, sir

483
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:40,146
No

484
00:38:40,419 --> 00:38:42,439
Everyone sunk in race

485
00:38:43,278 --> 00:38:45,878
Whats the use if you come first studying like this?

486
00:38:47,316 --> 00:38:49,417
will you improve your knowledge? No.

487
00:38:49,649 --> 00:38:51,750
Only pressure will increase

488
00:38:51,873 --> 00:38:54,671
And this is a college not a PRESSURE COOKER

489
00:38:55,148 --> 00:38:59,348
The lion in the circus also learns to sit on the chair fearing the whip held in his owner's hand

490
00:38:59,872 --> 00:39:03,373
But we call such a lion as well trained, not well educated

491
00:39:03,435 --> 00:39:04,435
Hello....

492
00:39:05,007 --> 00:39:06,507
This is not a philosophy class!

493
00:39:06,742 --> 00:39:09,342
Tell us the meaning of those 2 words,

494
00:39:09,612 --> 00:39:11,912
Sir, actually no such words exists sir

495
00:39:12,237 --> 00:39:14,336
These are my friend's names

496
00:39:14,356 --> 00:39:16,477
Farhan and Raju

497
00:39:27,319 --> 00:39:28,041
Quiet

498
00:39:28,137 --> 00:39:30,137
Non-sense

499
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:32,879
Like this you teach engineering?

500
00:39:32,906 --> 00:39:36,906
No sir I'm not teaching you engineering, you know better than me

501
00:39:37,465 --> 00:39:41,366
I was teaching you that, how to teach,

502
00:39:42,925 --> 00:39:45,724
And I believe that you learn someday for sure sir

503
00:39:46,195 --> 00:39:48,816
Because I never leave my weaker students hand

504
00:39:49,389 --> 00:39:50,509
Busted

505
00:39:52,841 --> 00:39:53,961
Quiet

506
00:39:55,429 --> 00:39:56,829
Quiet I said

507
00:39:59,717 --> 00:40:05,918
I would regret to inform you that your son Farhan, Raju is going on wrong routes

508
00:40:06,095 --> 00:40:09,395
If you don't take required action their future will be spoiled

509
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:13,558
VIRUS's letters fell down in our homes like an atom bomb

510
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:16,131
There was mourning in Hiroshima and Nagasaki!

511
00:40:16,541 --> 00:40:20,042
And we were invited to both the home to get kicked

512
00:40:20,663 --> 00:40:22,483
Come, come inside

513
00:40:24,331 --> 00:40:26,132
See there

514
00:40:26,865 --> 00:40:29,664
We could only afford one airconditioner

515
00:40:31,069 --> 00:40:34,768
And we didn't keep in our bedroom, we kept it in Farhans bedroom
for him to study conveniently

516
00:40:35,549 --> 00:40:40,149
I didn't buy a car, rode a scooter till now

517
00:40:40,726 --> 00:40:43,527
Invested all money in Farhans studies

518
00:40:43,881 --> 00:40:47,581
We sacrificed our future for Farhan's better future.. did you understand or not?

519
00:40:48,962 --> 00:40:52,181
Then can you imagine what I must be going through!

520
00:40:55,639 --> 00:40:57,658
Hey you took all these photos Farhan?

521
00:40:58,264 --> 00:40:59,364
Quiet

522
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:02,069
He has the ghost of photography in his head

523
00:41:02,125 --> 00:41:06,326
He used to take the images of animals and used to say he wanted to become
wild life photographer

524
00:41:07,139 --> 00:41:09,939
Son what was your percentage that year?

525
00:41:10,557 --> 00:41:11,957
91 percent

526
00:41:12,005 --> 00:41:13,125
Did you hear that?

527
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:16,921
From 94 percent straight down to 91 pecent

528
00:41:20,069 --> 00:41:21,889
You feel it funny?

529
00:41:22,234 --> 00:41:23,434
No no uncle no

530
00:41:23,516 --> 00:41:25,817
I was telling how great pictures he has taken

531
00:41:26,029 --> 00:41:29,028
Why you making him an engineer you could've  made him a wild life photographer

532
00:41:29,667 --> 00:41:33,668
I'm folding my hands and requesting you

533
00:41:33,722 --> 00:41:36,122
Please don't spoil my son's future

534
00:41:37,252 --> 00:41:38,372
Kids

535
00:41:38,381 --> 00:41:40,201
Come let's eat somethin

536
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:47,120
When you come next time have food and go....

537
00:41:49,442 --> 00:41:51,462
Dad though didn't give us food,

538
00:41:51,486 --> 00:41:55,707
And at last to fill our hungry stomachs, and to fill the quota of advise

539
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:57,531
We reached Raju's home

540
00:41:58,141 --> 00:42:02,163
Raju's home reminds us about the 1950's black and white films

541
00:42:02,924 --> 00:42:05,723
One small bed where his paralysed father rest

542
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:07,842
One coughing mother

543
00:42:07,897 --> 00:42:10,096
And one sister at her age of marriage

544
00:42:10,239 --> 00:42:11,841
Sofa with all springs out

545
00:42:11,876 --> 00:42:14,776
And 24 hours running water from terrace

546
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:18,620
Mother was retired from school and almost tired everytime...

547
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:21,380
His dad was a postmaster at his age

548
00:42:21,579 --> 00:42:25,280
After paralysis he lost his half body and salary completely....

549
00:42:25,299 --> 00:42:26,498
And sister!!!

550
00:42:26,765 --> 00:42:28,285
Kammo (Raju's sister) is 28 now...

551
00:42:28,361 --> 00:42:30,461
Asking Maruthi 800 as dowry...

552
00:42:30,549 --> 00:42:33,050
If don't study and all how she'll get married?

553
00:42:33,095 --> 00:42:34,814
Take lady's finger curry.. hand jee thank you

554
00:42:34,870 --> 00:42:37,670
You know what? Lady's finger has now become 12 rupees per kg

555
00:42:37,971 --> 00:42:39,271
And cauliflower 10 rupees

556
00:42:39,334 --> 00:42:40,855
World is looting all over

557
00:42:40,923 --> 00:42:44,123
These kind of letters come from college

558
00:42:44,221 --> 00:42:45,540
What will we eat??

559
00:42:47,145 --> 00:42:48,545
Want paneer?

560
00:42:48,595 --> 00:42:52,097
Someday back you get little of paneer in Goldsmith's shop

561
00:42:52,101 --> 00:42:53,201
Want paneer?

562
00:42:53,241 --> 00:42:54,640
No no enough

563
00:42:54,739 --> 00:42:56,839
Mom just leave it keep quiet, what?

564
00:42:57,295 --> 00:42:59,114
Ok ok, I'll keep quiet

565
00:43:01,172 --> 00:43:06,492
Earn for kids, work like a servant, and after all these keep mouth shut?

566
00:43:07,630 --> 00:43:12,230
Hey these all our news if I don't tell it to my son,
to whom will I say? to his friends?

567
00:43:16,801 --> 00:43:18,201
Hey Raju

568
00:43:19,146 --> 00:43:25,545
It was a big confusion whether we should control our friend or wipe his mother's tears

569
00:43:25,626 --> 00:43:29,027
Then we thought to leave all these matter, and
let's concentrate on mattar paneer now,

570
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:43,118
Even his exhema's cream comes for 55 rupees now

571
00:43:46,136 --> 00:43:47,536
Ewwww...

572
00:43:47,826 --> 00:43:49,447
Want more roti son???

573
00:43:49,499 --> 00:43:52,000
No no. Done. No. Stomach is filled aunty

574
00:43:59,643 --> 00:44:02,762
Lady's finger 12 rupees and caulli flower 10 rupees hehheee

575
00:44:05,235 --> 00:44:09,036
At least we offered you some food unlike your hungy father

576
00:44:09,103 --> 00:44:10,502
Hitler Qureshi

577
00:44:10,532 --> 00:44:13,532
Huh huh. Your mom is Mother Theresa right? She was serving us itchy roti

578
00:44:13,537 --> 00:44:15,636
Don't make fun of my mother

579
00:44:15,677 --> 00:44:18,479
Hey leave it, why you all fighting? Feeling damn hungry. Come let's go have some food outside

580
00:44:18,495 --> 00:44:21,595
This is the end of month. Who'll give money? His mom, Mother Teresa?

581
00:44:21,673 --> 00:44:25,172
To have food doesn't require money dude, uniform is required uniform

582
00:44:25,732 --> 00:44:27,133
Watch there..

583
00:44:28,694 --> 00:44:29,815
Come

584
00:44:30,036 --> 00:44:31,156
Come

585
00:44:32,538 --> 00:44:34,357
Namaste jee, namaste

586
00:44:34,377 --> 00:44:35,777
Ooh uncle

587
00:44:39,752 --> 00:44:42,052
Hey, listen, get us 3 glasses of vodka

588
00:44:42,142 --> 00:44:43,962
Half soda half water

589
00:44:44,145 --> 00:44:45,945
What are the starters available?

590
00:44:46,010 --> 00:44:47,510
What ever get us two plates each

591
00:44:47,545 --> 00:44:48,865
And leave this here

592
00:44:48,948 --> 00:44:50,368
And change the music yaar. Put some ghazal or something

593
00:44:50,743 --> 00:44:52,663
Pia what the hell is this?

594
00:44:52,729 --> 00:44:53,849
What have you worn?

595
00:44:53,944 --> 00:44:56,046
Bloody 18th century watch?

596
00:44:56,057 --> 00:44:58,776
What people will say?

597
00:44:58,886 --> 00:45:01,505
Watch Suhas's fiance, she is gonna become doctor,

598
00:45:01,521 --> 00:45:03,720
And she's wearing a watch just costing 200 bucks?

599
00:45:03,889 --> 00:45:05,009
Please take it off. Thank you

600
00:45:05,717 --> 00:45:06,918
Hi handsome

601
00:45:06,939 --> 00:45:08,339
Hey aunty,

602
00:45:08,343 --> 00:45:09,763
You're looking good

603
00:45:09,835 --> 00:45:11,055
Don't miss my set darling

604
00:45:11,387 --> 00:45:12,207
Rubies?

605
00:45:12,286 --> 00:45:13,306
From Mendelaves..

606
00:45:13,376 --> 00:45:15,197
Mendelave, wow!!!

607
00:45:15,220 --> 00:45:18,020
Hey let's go meet David, come I'll show you, of course, of course

608
00:45:21,208 --> 00:45:22,607
Excuse me

609
00:45:23,817 --> 00:45:24,938
Yes

610
00:45:25,037 --> 00:45:26,437
Um... flowers

611
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:29,491
Um... Can I take this glass?

612
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:30,720
Why?

613
00:45:30,808 --> 00:45:33,609
What if you break my head with a glass?

614
00:45:33,615 --> 00:45:35,215
Why should I throw this on you?

615
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:38,060
Because I'm gonna give you some free advice,

616
00:45:38,651 --> 00:45:39,770
What?

617
00:45:39,777 --> 00:45:41,877
Don't ever marry that fool,

618
00:45:42,514 --> 00:45:43,314
Excuse me

619
00:45:43,415 --> 00:45:45,017
He is not a human, he is just a price tag, price tag

620
00:45:45,111 --> 00:45:48,210
He'll embarrass you telling all prices of different things all your life,

621
00:45:48,499 --> 00:45:51,318
Your life will be spoiled and your future will be finished,

622
00:45:51,522 --> 00:45:53,342
Should I give a demo?

623
00:45:54,479 --> 00:45:56,879
Should I find out what's the price for his shoes?

624
00:45:57,298 --> 00:46:00,797
I'm not gonna ask him, he himself will reveal, just a sec

625
00:46:08,135 --> 00:46:09,255
Oh my God!

626
00:46:09,781 --> 00:46:10,900
Hey hey

627
00:46:10,944 --> 00:46:12,764
What have you done?

628
00:46:12,793 --> 00:46:14,214
These are 300 $ shoes

629
00:46:14,284 --> 00:46:17,084
You dropped mint chutney on my 300 $ shoes!

630
00:46:17,170 --> 00:46:20,269
Run away, it's a free advise, take it or leave it

631
00:46:20,274 --> 00:46:23,075
Genuine Italian leather hand stiched

632
00:46:27,251 --> 00:46:28,371
Dad

633
00:46:28,573 --> 00:46:30,393
Are these your guests?

634
00:46:32,732 --> 00:46:34,552
These are my students

635
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:37,079
Why they're here?

636
00:46:39,584 --> 00:46:40,704
One sec

637
00:46:42,347 --> 00:46:45,147
This is really good dude, smelling very good,

638
00:46:45,194 --> 00:46:48,495
Hey no space for puri dude, adjust it by side, ohh

639
00:46:49,477 --> 00:46:50,097
Hi

640
00:46:50,142 --> 00:46:51,162
Hey, hi,

641
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:54,759
You helped me opening up my eyes, thank you so much

642
00:46:55,932 --> 00:46:58,531
Nothing like that... It was my duty!

643
00:46:58,671 --> 00:47:00,772
can I ask you for a little  more help?

644
00:47:00,866 --> 00:47:01,987
Ya ya

645
00:47:02,009 --> 00:47:05,009
My dad won't allow me to break the engagement with Suhas

646
00:47:05,125 --> 00:47:06,945
How great you explain!

647
00:47:07,242 --> 00:47:09,262
It would be good if you give a demo for him also

648
00:47:09,304 --> 00:47:10,924
Ya ya. Why not, why not? I'll give a demo

649
00:47:11,008 --> 00:47:12,328
Raju get me chutney,

650
00:47:12,554 --> 00:47:14,375
You're really sweet,

651
00:47:14,527 --> 00:47:16,326
Where is he, where is your dad?

652
00:47:16,374 --> 00:47:17,994
Totally behind you,

653
00:47:18,134 --> 00:47:19,254
Ooh

654
00:47:22,918 --> 00:47:23,938
Aal iz well, aal iz well

655
00:47:25,502 --> 00:47:30,202
Run away, it's a free advise. Take it or leave it

656
00:47:30,401 --> 00:47:32,221
What are you all doing here?

657
00:47:32,441 --> 00:47:35,740
Um sir... we'll go on the stage, give this envelope and come sir

658
00:47:36,225 --> 00:47:37,625
Give it to me

659
00:47:37,625 --> 00:47:39,526
This is my sister's marriage

660
00:47:39,546 --> 00:47:41,367
Umm. Sis, sister?

661
00:47:42,758 --> 00:47:45,557
Sir, totally how many daughters do you have, sir?

662
00:47:46,568 --> 00:47:47,887
It's empty!

663
00:47:49,874 --> 00:47:51,975
As though we didn't invite you

664
00:47:52,193 --> 00:47:54,992
You all might be from groom's side right?

665
00:47:55,416 --> 00:47:58,216
No sir. Actually we're from science's side sir

666
00:47:58,608 --> 00:47:59,628
How?

667
00:47:59,817 --> 00:48:00,837
Can you explain?

668
00:48:01,014 --> 00:48:03,115
Dad, he explains really good,

669
00:48:03,127 --> 00:48:05,227
Now he'll give a demo

670
00:48:05,652 --> 00:48:09,973
Um... sir in Delhi,
power goes out frequently sir

671
00:48:10,468 --> 00:48:15,165
And this really affects the marriage too sir
so I thought to make an inverter

672
00:48:15,213 --> 00:48:17,214
That can generate power from all cars that has come in the marriage,

673
00:48:17,236 --> 00:48:18,156
Ohh

674
00:48:19,128 --> 00:48:20,248
Wow

675
00:48:20,524 --> 00:48:22,624
And did you make the inverter?

676
00:48:22,661 --> 00:48:24,761
Sir, design is ready sir!

677
00:48:26,888 --> 00:48:28,710
Um... Where is the design Farhan?

678
00:48:28,874 --> 00:48:30,574
I've given you the design right?

679
00:48:30,986 --> 00:48:32,205
Aah, I had given it to Raju,

680
00:48:32,238 --> 00:48:33,637
Raju? The design?

681
00:48:36,003 --> 00:48:39,904
Sir, actually, leave it sir, I'll make the inverter itself and show you directly,

682
00:48:39,938 --> 00:48:43,939
You can only make us fool, not an inverter!!!

683
00:48:44,005 --> 00:48:46,825
No sir, I'll surely make the inverter, I promise

684
00:48:46,839 --> 00:48:49,639
And I'll give your name for the inverter

685
00:48:49,701 --> 00:48:54,101
Because after all it had been invented in your daughter's marriage so it's an honour

686
00:48:54,155 --> 00:49:00,155
Farhan, Raju... I wish to meet both of you in the office tomorrow

687
00:49:05,684 --> 00:49:08,386
Sir what was your per plate cost sir,

688
00:49:08,472 --> 00:49:09,592
We'll pay sir

689
00:49:10,006 --> 00:49:12,105
In terms of installment sir

690
00:49:13,356 --> 00:49:15,356
And afterward we won't intrude in any marriage sir

691
00:49:15,383 --> 00:49:17,084
I won't even go into my marriage sir,

692
00:49:17,115 --> 00:49:19,216
Infact I won't even marry sir. Even he won't marry sir

693
00:49:20,004 --> 00:49:22,104
Huh huh, even I won't sir

694
00:49:22,769 --> 00:49:24,868
Even your parents shouldn't have married

695
00:49:26,407 --> 00:49:29,007
2 idiots wouldn't have taken birth in this world

696
00:49:31,726 --> 00:49:33,126
Sit!!!!!!!!

697
00:49:42,818 --> 00:49:43,939
Pay attention...

698
00:49:49,929 --> 00:49:51,049
??????

699
00:49:54,417 --> 00:49:57,919
This is Ranchhodas's father's monthly income

700
00:49:58,617 --> 00:50:00,017
2.5 crores rupees,

701
00:50:00,490 --> 00:50:01,890
Now from this,

702
00:50:01,940 --> 00:50:05,261
One, or let it be two zeros if you remove out...

703
00:50:05,290 --> 00:50:08,089
Doesn't make much difference to bother,

704
00:50:08,869 --> 00:50:11,767
But if one more zero is less,

705
00:50:14,162 --> 00:50:15,782
I would worry a little

706
00:50:16,184 --> 00:50:19,784
This is your father's monthly income, Mr.Farhan!

707
00:50:21,024 --> 00:50:22,425
Ye... yes sir,

708
00:50:23,683 --> 00:50:26,983
And now if you make it one more zero less,

709
00:50:28,451 --> 00:50:32,051
Now this is your family income Mr.Raju Rastogi,

710
00:50:32,866 --> 00:50:35,188
Big reason to worry,

711
00:50:38,650 --> 00:50:43,450
Follow Viru Shastrabhuddi's suggestion, change your rooms

712
00:50:43,549 --> 00:50:46,349
And get shifted with Chatur Ramalingam

713
00:50:46,430 --> 00:50:49,429
Exams are closer, and if you are with that Chanchad,

714
00:50:49,476 --> 00:50:51,276
You'll never pass exams!

715
00:51:04,897 --> 00:51:06,996
#..... opera started......#

716
00:51:11,334 --> 00:51:12,735
Wanna get shaved?

717
00:51:12,866 --> 00:51:13,766
No sir,

718
00:51:13,802 --> 00:51:15,502
Then get lost!

719
00:51:25,297 --> 00:51:26,996
Raju you try to understand,

720
00:51:27,078 --> 00:51:30,097
VIRUS is playing games between us, divide and rule

721
00:51:30,117 --> 00:51:31,238
Don't get scared,

722
00:51:31,336 --> 00:51:32,656
Had to be scared!

723
00:51:32,716 --> 00:51:36,116
For me to get a good job, I need good grades. And the grades are within his hands

724
00:51:36,123 --> 00:51:39,844
I don't have a rich father like you... Using those money, I could spend the rest of my life

725
00:51:39,927 --> 00:51:41,428
Hey Raju, what non-sense are you telling?

726
00:51:41,438 --> 00:51:44,937
Should we do whatever he says huh? Aal iz well, aal iz well?

727
00:51:45,015 --> 00:51:45,914
You'll be the only one who's gonna catch his tail not me,

728
00:51:46,955 --> 00:51:48,054
Now you're crossing the line

729
00:51:48,103 --> 00:51:52,105
No. I'm making line in between, because I have to support my family!

730
00:51:53,475 --> 00:51:56,995
Mom's half salary has been spend on dad's medicines

731
00:51:57,189 --> 00:51:59,189
Sister's marriage is not happening,

732
00:51:59,231 --> 00:52:02,732
As the groom wants maruthi 800

733
00:52:04,623 --> 00:52:06,442
from past 5 years

734
00:52:06,578 --> 00:52:09,378
Mom didn't even buy one saree

735
00:52:11,348 --> 00:52:14,548
yaar... Now in this argument... If you are getting mother's saree in between... What can I say?

736
00:52:14,662 --> 00:52:17,981
yaar... so like that how many sarees are reserved for one year? heheh

737
00:52:18,245 --> 00:52:20,346
Don't make fun of my mother,

738
00:52:20,577 --> 00:52:22,897
Hey Raju we will study, with complete dedication we'll study,

739
00:52:22,921 --> 00:52:24,820
But not only to pass exams,

740
00:52:25,181 --> 00:52:29,383
Some great scholar has said,
"never study to be successful, study for self efficiency"

741
00:52:30,033 --> 00:52:31,453
Don't run behind success,

742
00:52:31,564 --> 00:52:32,263
Excellence

743
00:52:32,451 --> 00:52:33,471
Follow behind excellence

744
00:52:33,531 --> 00:52:35,531
Success will come all way behind you,

745
00:52:36,271 --> 00:52:37,871
Who? The great scholar said this?

746
00:52:38,010 --> 00:52:39,832
BABA Ranchhodas???

747
00:52:43,446 --> 00:52:44,466
Hey hey. Don't take tension yaar

748
00:52:44,531 --> 00:52:46,531
We'll top the exams yaar, nothing is impossible!

749
00:52:46,571 --> 00:52:47,591
Nothing is impossible? Huh?

750
00:52:50,952 --> 00:52:51,752
Take this

751
00:52:51,996 --> 00:52:54,217
Now put this back, k!

752
00:52:55,684 --> 00:52:57,784
Raju changed his train's bogey

753
00:52:57,986 --> 00:53:00,305
Now he started the journey (saffar) with Chatur,

754
00:53:00,472 --> 00:53:02,292
Not the "saffar" in Hindi,

755
00:53:02,297 --> 00:53:03,416
English's SUFFER

756
00:53:03,767 --> 00:53:04,287
S

757
00:53:04,303 --> 00:53:04,823
SU

758
00:53:04,865 --> 00:53:05,185
SUF

759
00:53:05,187 --> 00:53:05,707
SUFF

760
00:53:05,803 --> 00:53:06,123
SUFFE

761
00:53:06,161 --> 00:53:06,681
SUFFER

762
00:53:06,738 --> 00:53:07,639
SUFFER hehhehe

763
00:53:07,722 --> 00:53:09,142
Everyone calls Chatur as "Silencer"

764
00:53:09,146 --> 00:53:11,146
To make his mind even more sharper,

765
00:53:11,243 --> 00:53:13,443
he used to eat some bengali BABA's PAN,

766
00:53:13,542 --> 00:53:16,742
and he used to leave his HOT AIR!!!!

767
00:53:18,117 --> 00:53:19,517
I didn't do it!

768
00:53:19,572 --> 00:53:20,971
Raju....

769
00:53:21,062 --> 00:53:24,261
and he always put the blame on others!

770
00:53:24,316 --> 00:53:27,316
SILENCER used to mug up 18 hours a day

771
00:53:27,329 --> 00:53:30,650
and during exam's night, he used to distract others from study

772
00:53:30,771 --> 00:53:33,791
#.... ooh baby.... come on baby ye.....#

773
00:53:34,092 --> 00:53:37,692
he believed in two ways of topping exams

774
00:53:37,724 --> 00:53:43,724
one is to get marks by yourself,  or try reducing other's marks

775
00:53:44,293 --> 00:53:50,293
Rancho has made the combined plan to teach Silencer a lesson and to help Raju,

776
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:58,320
Our director sir has done much miracle here,

777
00:53:58,343 --> 00:53:59,343
Chamatkaar (miracle) means....

778
00:53:59,407 --> 00:54:03,906
I don't want the meaning Dubey Jee, I'll memorize it....

779
00:54:04,879 --> 00:54:08,381
Chatur has been chosen to present introductory speech on teacher's day

780
00:54:08,704 --> 00:54:14,103
He wrote speech in pure Hindi from librarian Dubey Jee to impress VIRUS,

781
00:54:15,770 --> 00:54:16,890
Hello,

782
00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:18,212
yes, will call,

783
00:54:18,444 --> 00:54:20,264
Chatur, you have a call

784
00:54:20,404 --> 00:54:23,604
Dubey Jee, please keep this print out with you, I'll come back sometime,

785
00:54:24,294 --> 00:54:27,314
ooh, even do that work also...

786
00:54:31,077 --> 00:54:32,277
Hey Dubey Jee!

787
00:54:32,387 --> 00:54:35,689
director sir has remembered you, ya now

788
00:54:35,884 --> 00:54:40,402
ok, you give this to Chatur, I'll come back now

789
00:54:44,195 --> 00:54:45,516
hello, hello

790
00:54:45,794 --> 00:54:47,214
hello Mr.Ramalingam,

791
00:54:47,332 --> 00:54:48,452
yes

792
00:54:48,473 --> 00:54:51,273
ya I'm calling from Lajpat Nagar police station,

793
00:54:51,314 --> 00:54:52,934
Are you from Uganda?

794
00:54:53,018 --> 00:54:54,019
Yes sir,

795
00:54:54,140 --> 00:54:56,839
Hmm. Your life is under risk,

796
00:54:57,156 --> 00:54:58,556
what how?

797
00:54:58,808 --> 00:55:01,807
Umm... Listen to my instructions carefullly

798
00:55:02,203 --> 00:55:06,304
Else when you step out from the college gate
you'll face death in centre of road itself,

799
00:55:06,389 --> 00:55:08,009
Why? What happened?

800
00:55:08,042 --> 00:55:10,142
By the time Chatur recovers from this shock,

801
00:55:10,296 --> 00:55:13,297
Before that Rancho changed a few words in the speech

802
00:55:13,399 --> 00:55:14,399
like.....

803
00:55:14,449 --> 00:55:17,249
Chamathkaar [=miracle] has become Balathkaar [=rape]

804
00:55:17,339 --> 00:55:18,858
Did you call me sir?

805
00:55:18,896 --> 00:55:20,296
who are you?

806
00:55:20,304 --> 00:55:22,124
Dubey the librarian,

807
00:55:23,345 --> 00:55:25,164
I'm permenant sir,

808
00:55:25,741 --> 00:55:26,961
CONGRATULATIONS!!

809
00:55:27,737 --> 00:55:28,657
Um... one min, one min

810
00:55:28,756 --> 00:55:30,475
Commisioner sir's call, hold on,

811
00:55:30,557 --> 00:55:32,378
Excuse me sir...

812
00:55:37,696 --> 00:55:39,516
Take the phone. Take it.
What to say?

813
00:55:40,952 --> 00:55:43,373
Ya ya, where was I?

814
00:55:43,496 --> 00:55:45,695
You were telling, outside gate, my death

815
00:55:46,402 --> 00:55:51,422
Huh! When you go out the gate, you a see a signal in front of you

816
00:55:51,466 --> 00:55:53,787
Traffic signal! Huh okay, okay...

817
00:55:54,592 --> 00:55:57,491
When that signal becomes red,

818
00:55:58,010 --> 00:56:00,130
all vehicle will stop,

819
00:56:00,194 --> 00:56:01,595
okay, okay then

820
00:56:01,646 --> 00:56:03,746
then you cross the road carefully,

821
00:56:04,036 --> 00:56:06,836
you know why son, nowadays' traffic is huge

822
00:56:06,884 --> 00:56:09,904
so if any vehicle hits you or somethin, you might die

823
00:56:11,076 --> 00:56:13,175
what non-sense I know that!

824
00:56:13,351 --> 00:56:16,550
Oh you know that, very good son, then you are safe.
well done, well done.

825
00:56:16,608 --> 00:56:18,707
#......became a fool.......#

826
00:56:22,777 --> 00:56:24,997
Hey SILENCER!!! Dubey has given you this,

827
00:56:25,029 --> 00:56:27,830
Hey you don't call me that CHANCHAD,

828
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:29,800
CHANCHAD

829
00:56:32,015 --> 00:56:34,814
Director told me that he didn't call me,

830
00:56:34,911 --> 00:56:37,910
He didn't call you, I said that he remembered you!

831
00:56:38,930 --> 00:56:40,331
Idiots...

832
00:56:47,421 --> 00:56:49,621
Respected teachers,

833
00:56:51,658 --> 00:56:55,957
Chief guest minister Shri RD Tripati Ji,

834
00:56:56,551 --> 00:57:00,952
Students and dear friends...

835
00:57:01,749 --> 00:57:06,849
Today if ICE is touching sky high limits,

836
00:57:07,426 --> 00:57:11,627
then the credit goes to only one man

837
00:57:11,940 --> 00:57:14,239
Shri Viru Shastrabhuddi

838
00:57:14,326 --> 00:57:15,446
Give him a hand,

839
00:57:15,454 --> 00:57:17,875
Sir he's saying it...

840
00:57:17,913 --> 00:57:19,934
but every word is mine

841
00:57:20,113 --> 00:57:22,212
he is a great guy, really you are,

842
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:26,859
for the past 32 years he had continuosly

843
00:57:27,284 --> 00:57:28,886
in this college,

844
00:57:28,893 --> 00:57:31,793
has done rapes after rapes,,,

845
00:57:33,976 --> 00:57:36,476
this means... miracles upon miracles

846
00:57:36,512 --> 00:57:39,412
hope he continues to do so

847
00:57:41,723 --> 00:57:43,443
We're all amazed...

848
00:57:43,674 --> 00:57:48,875
how a person of his age can do these many rapes?

849
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:54,260
with his extreme self discipline...

850
00:57:54,488 --> 00:57:57,789
he has made himself this capable

851
00:58:00,697 --> 00:58:02,717
right usage of time

852
00:58:02,905 --> 00:58:05,905
attention to details...

853
00:58:05,972 --> 00:58:07,994
Everyone, learn from him,

854
00:58:09,588 --> 00:58:11,586
learn from him, learn from him...

855
00:58:11,621 --> 00:58:13,441
Sit down. Sit down

856
00:58:15,038 --> 00:58:17,639
Today... We're all students here.

857
00:58:18,202 --> 00:58:21,203
Tomorrow, we'll spread across so many countries

858
00:58:21,255 --> 00:58:23,075
I promise you all

859
00:58:23,114 --> 00:58:27,314
Whichever country we visit... we'll rape!!!

860
00:58:30,773 --> 00:58:33,874
We'll enlighten the name of ICE!!!

861
00:58:39,277 --> 00:58:41,097
We'll show everyone,

862
00:58:41,474 --> 00:58:46,875
The capability to perform rape that students have here

863
00:58:47,137 --> 00:58:50,256
No other student across the globe has it!!!

864
00:58:52,607 --> 00:58:55,408
No other student, no other student!

865
00:58:57,442 --> 00:58:59,261
Respected minister..

866
00:58:59,310 --> 00:59:00,710
Namaskar

867
00:59:00,793 --> 00:59:04,292
You have given that thing for this institution....

868
00:59:04,615 --> 00:59:07,915
That we needed the most...

869
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:09,520
Money money!!!

870
00:59:09,679 --> 00:59:10,999
Tits

871
00:59:14,151 --> 00:59:16,751
Not that.... That means ****

872
00:59:16,958 --> 00:59:18,978
What kind of offensive speach is this?

873
00:59:19,267 --> 00:59:21,867
Everyone has tits...

874
00:59:22,378 --> 00:59:24,479
But keep them for themselves...

875
00:59:25,686 --> 00:59:27,785
Nobody shares...

876
00:59:30,659 --> 00:59:31,259
eeaan eaan???

877
00:59:31,339 --> 00:59:32,259
This guy is too vulgar

878
00:59:32,287 --> 00:59:38,009
You have placed your tits in the hands of this rapist

879
00:59:39,893 --> 00:59:41,513
Now let us see,

880
00:59:41,610 --> 00:59:44,531
What he does with them...

881
00:59:44,627 --> 00:59:47,427
Shastrabhuddi, don't you have so much of brains

882
00:59:47,766 --> 00:59:49,166
Indecent guy...

883
00:59:55,892 --> 00:59:59,012
On this golden occasion, I'd like to quote a shlok...

884
00:59:59,065 --> 01:00:02,466
listen listen... now he'll explain the farting strength gradation in sanskrit

885
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:06,400
Utthamam dadhdadaath paadam
[ when I fart loudest is at its best (like motor vehicle)... ]

886
01:00:06,402 --> 01:00:08,000
paadam?!? [ =fart ]
ooh Silencer!!!...

887
01:00:08,123 --> 01:00:12,623
Madyam paadam..... tuchuka tuchuk.
[ without full pressure it comes like thuchuka thuchuk (the sound of train) ]

888
01:00:13,230 --> 01:00:19,500
kanishtam thud thudiya paadam
[ with controlled pressure it sounds thud thudi (sound of a sirene)... ]

889
01:00:19,642 --> 01:00:28,744
sur suriiee.... praana gatakam...
[ but the silent ones are breath of life (aka silent killers)... ]

890
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:37,255
see, without understanding if you cram things,
this will be the result, see see

891
01:00:37,340 --> 01:00:40,840
By cramming, you can save 4 years of your college life..

892
01:00:41,259 --> 01:00:44,859
but for the next 40 years of your life, you'll go on getting raped...

893
01:00:45,351 --> 01:00:49,650
aare yaar, we're explaining him so much..

Get used to it Pia.. You're gonna be Suhas tandon's wife!!

938
01:03:03,151 --> 01:03:04,971

Ooh... Umm... Yeah.

942
01:03:24,191 --> 01:03:26,092
what problem do you have with my dad, huh?

943
01:03:26,191 --> 01:03:27,210
I don't have any problem with him.

944
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:29,720
I'm making an inverter on his name... see this

945
01:03:29,834 --> 01:03:30,754
ooh...

946
01:03:32,498 --> 01:03:34,500
broke it!

947
01:03:34,514 --> 01:03:36,414
why are you behind my dad, huh?

948
01:03:36,456 --> 01:03:38,256
because he's not running a college, but a factory.

949
01:03:38,273 --> 01:03:40,172
where donkeys are manufactured every year....

950
01:03:40,261 --> 01:03:43,261
See... See over there... Your donkey

951
01:03:50,714 --> 01:03:52,213
How dare you call him a donkey!!

952
01:03:52,285 --> 01:03:53,285
Then what else should I call him?

953
01:03:53,375 --> 01:03:57,976
First he did engineering... then MBA...
and after that he went to America to work for a bank... heeeh

954
01:03:58,004 --> 01:04:00,304
If he had to work in a bank only, then why did he do engineering?

955
01:04:00,306 --> 01:04:03,306
for such donkeys... life only means profit or loss statement...

956
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:05,520
he's seeing there's profit being with you, that's why he's with you

957
01:04:05,606 --> 01:04:09,606
you, director's daughter whose gonna be a doctor, it's good for his image etc etc

958
01:04:09,723 --> 01:04:12,024
He has no attachment with you...

959
01:04:12,355 --> 01:04:14,256
what do you think of yourself?

960
01:04:14,271 --> 01:04:16,870
what do you mean by saying Suhas is not interested in me?

961
01:04:16,948 --> 01:04:20,446
aare... you bought new watch?... one minute... hold this

962
01:04:20,943 --> 01:04:23,044

01:04:27,029 --> 01:04:28,729

4 lakhs!?!... mine cost only 150 yaar but shows the same time

970
01:04:39,115 --> 01:04:40,214
Oh shut up!

971
01:04:40,234 --> 01:04:43,655
how could you be so careless Pia? This careless attitude is disgusting

972
01:04:43,732 --> 01:04:44,752
It's disrespectful

973
01:04:44,804 --> 01:04:47,604
that was a limited edition watch you just lost!

974
01:04:47,619 --> 01:04:51,540
You got it 4 free... so that's it... Now you wear your 18th century watch at dinner.

975
01:04:51,838 --> 01:04:53,938

01:05:29,570 --> 01:05:31,371
yaar it's too much noisy here right..?

982
01:05:31,432 --> 01:05:33,132
she's saying thank you to me, but I hear it as get lost

983
01:05:33,161 --> 01:05:34,681
I said get lost only!

984
01:05:34,743 --> 01:05:36,042
aare yaar, why're you getting so angry?

985
01:05:36,050 --> 01:05:38,970
do you know... actually you never had loved him at all!

986
01:05:39,053 --> 01:05:40,454
what do you mean?

987
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:42,480
means... whenever he comes in front of you..

988
01:05:42,525 --> 01:05:48,825
have you ever felt like wind is blowing..or dupatta/veil is flying in slow motion??

989
01:05:48,850 --> 01:05:51,251
or the moon looks even bigger in the sky....?

990
01:05:51,346 --> 01:05:53,846
such things only happens in a film, not in real life!

991
01:05:53,894 --> 01:05:56,892
aare no-no..it happens in real life also....if you love a human, it'll happen...

992
01:05:56,906 --> 01:05:58,906
it doesn't happen with donkeys

993
01:05:59,729 --> 01:06:01,549

01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:58,701
our country is so weird... there is a guarantee for pizza to arrive in 30 mins... but an ambulance!

1012
01:06:58,882 --> 01:07:00,981
He must be hospitalised... Urgently!

1013
01:07:14,091 --> 01:07:15,491
Hey stop man!

1014
01:07:17,231 --> 01:07:19,752

1019
01:07:40,812 --> 01:07:41,712
Hey Raju

1020
01:07:41,714 --> 01:07:43,814
Idiot, you brought dad on a scooter?

1021
01:07:44,462 --> 01:07:46,764
Then should I have sent him through a speed-post?

1022
01:07:46,832 --> 01:07:48,631
Don't get into my dad's profession!

1023
01:07:48,692 --> 01:07:50,511
where?... where is dad?

1024
01:07:50,792 --> 01:07:52,611
ask the doctor!!!

1025
01:07:52,847 --> 01:07:53,847
this was a close call Pia...

1026
01:07:53,938 --> 01:07:55,959
If it would've been late by 2 or 2.5 hours, then we would have lost him

1027
01:07:55,974 --> 01:08:01,375
good that you did not wait for an ambulance and got him on a scooter,
I'll go now..if there is any problem..call me ok..bye

this chutney is very useful,

1067
01:12:03,781 --> 01:12:07,281
this is not only to have,
but its really useful to understand people too.

1068
01:12:07,727 --> 01:12:10,448
now the bad time has gone for you...

1069
01:12:10,485 --> 01:12:13,085
now you can leave donkeys and start loving humans

1070
01:12:13,154 --> 01:12:15,955
time is perfect for starting love....

1071
01:12:19,240 --> 01:12:22,559
temperature is constant... and the climate is clear and clean....

1072
01:12:22,585 --> 01:12:26,086
and if you felt love for someone...
sure it's gonna rain on you...

1073
01:14:32,460 --> 01:14:34,280
hello... wake up!

1074
01:14:35,574 --> 01:14:37,174

01:14:37,185 --> 01:14:38,585

1077
01:14:42,023 --> 01:14:44,522

1078
01:14:44,704 --> 01:14:47,303
I'm there, doctors are there.. And its only a matter of 3 hours

1079
01:14:47,313 --> 01:14:50,314
C'mon... take my scooter and go... Now come on go... it's getting late

1080
01:14:50,332 --> 01:14:51,452
hey!!

1081
01:14:55,050 --> 01:14:57,550

1082
01:15:03,036 --> 01:15:04,156
Go!!

1083
01:15:21,385 --> 01:15:24,185

01:15:29,319 --> 01:15:31,139

1085
01:15:34,869 --> 01:15:36,969
sir, they are still writing!

1086
01:15:37,477 --> 01:15:39,298
Hello... time up!

1087
01:15:39,967 --> 01:15:43,968
Sir... 5 minutes sir. We were half-an hour late!
it was an emergency sir..please please

1088
01:15:44,044 --> 01:15:48,045
Examiner looked at us like we asked for both his kidneys!!

1089
01:15:48,570 --> 01:15:50,669
but we still continued to write

1090
01:15:50,867 --> 01:15:54,366
while he was busy arranging papers according to roll numbers

1091
01:16:02,130 --> 01:16:03,530
it's over sir

1092
01:16:03,617 --> 01:16:06,717
you're late!.. I can't take your papers

1093
01:16:07,098 --> 01:16:08,499
sir, please sir

1094
01:16:11,638 --> 01:16:13,738
sir, do you know, who we are?

1095
01:16:14,190 --> 01:16:18,790
even if you are prime minister's son, I won't accept your paper!

1096
01:16:19,594 --> 01:16:22,595
Sir, do you know our names and roll numbers??

1097
01:16:23,542 --> 01:16:26,863
No... who are you guys?

1098
01:16:26,946 --> 01:16:29,446
You don't know... then.. run run run run

1099
01:16:30,857 --> 01:16:33,458
hey... what's your roll number?

1100
01:16:33,494 --> 01:16:35,895
where is it?

1101
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:38,180
where is his paper?

1102
01:16:39,336 --> 01:16:40,736
aaaahhh!

1103
01:16:43,336 --> 01:16:45,638
today the results were gonna come

1104
01:16:45,741 --> 01:16:49,841
scared and innocent!... all were busy striking a deal with God

1105
01:16:49,862 --> 01:16:52,761
God... please save me with electronics, I'll break coconuts!

1106
01:16:52,848 --> 01:16:57,268
Oh snake-god!... Save my physics... I shall send one litre of milk everyday!

1107
01:16:57,315 --> 01:17:00,616
Oh cow-god! Just... just get me passing marks

1108
01:17:00,634 --> 01:17:05,635
God. I'll treat Malati and Sangeeta like my sisters. Please save my results

1109
01:17:05,652 --> 01:17:09,650
God. God. I'll offer 100RS per month. Surely God! Promise!

1110
01:17:09,735 --> 01:17:15,136
Nowadays, traffic constables don't accept 100RS.
As if God would fall for it!

1111
01:17:15,610 --> 01:17:18,410
Check... check... check from below... check from below

1112
01:17:18,648 --> 01:17:20,948
It's yours yaar. In the last...

1113
01:17:22,338 --> 01:17:23,740
and yours?

1114
01:17:25,568 --> 01:17:27,467
second last!

1115
01:17:27,978 --> 01:17:29,777
and Rancho?

1116
01:17:33,686 --> 01:17:35,706
It's not there yaar!

1117
01:17:35,785 --> 01:17:37,185
My heart sank,

1118
01:17:37,545 --> 01:17:42,145
Not because we were last but because our friend had failed!

1119
01:17:42,409 --> 01:17:43,109
Not possible.

1120
01:17:43,201 --> 01:17:43,621
It's fine Chatur

1121
01:17:43,706 --> 01:17:46,506
There is a mistake!..it's not possible!

1122
01:17:46,514 --> 01:17:49,314
This is injustice..injustice..Oh God!!

1123
01:17:51,321 --> 01:17:54,322
Why is this idiot Silencer shouting so much?

1124
01:17:54,862 --> 01:17:55,981
He has come second...

1125
01:17:56,241 --> 01:17:59,360
Idiot... whose first then?

1126
01:18:00,363 --> 01:18:01,484
Rancho!

1127
01:18:04,563 --> 01:18:07,063
Rancho...idiot..

1128
01:18:07,799 --> 01:18:09,619
Move... move yaar

1129
01:18:12,923 --> 01:18:16,023
we learnt something about human behaviour that day

1130
01:18:16,091 --> 01:18:18,011
if your friend fails, you feel sad!..

1131
01:18:18,052 --> 01:18:21,551
but if your friend comes first.. You feel even more sad!

1132
01:18:21,594 --> 01:18:22,794
on that day..we were sad..

1133
01:18:22,794 --> 01:18:26,694
but there were two more people who were sadder than us

1134
01:18:26,774 --> 01:18:30,274
Ranchhoddas Chanchad..first row..right of the director!

1135
01:18:30,904 --> 01:18:33,704
Uday Sinha... second row... third seat!

1136
01:18:34,542 --> 01:18:38,142
Alok Mittal... second row... fifth seat!
hey!

1137
01:18:42,064 --> 01:18:45,363
Sir... is it compulsory to sit acccording to our ranks?

1138
01:18:45,414 --> 01:18:46,913
why, do you have any problem?

1139
01:18:46,997 --> 01:18:49,496
sir, I have problem with entire grading system itself!

1140
01:18:49,572 --> 01:18:54,174
It's like the caste-system sir! A grade students - kings, C grade students - slaves!

1141
01:18:54,207 --> 01:18:55,627
it's not nice sir!

1142
01:18:55,798 --> 01:18:57,898
do you have a better idea for this?

1143
01:18:57,905 --> 01:18:59,725
yes sir, I do have!

1144
01:18:59,783 --> 01:19:02,784
results should not be put up on a notice board....

1145
01:19:02,805 --> 01:19:06,704
why should we exhibit someone's weakness in front of all?

1146
01:19:06,722 --> 01:19:10,222
now sir... if in your blood test, the haemoglobin count is less.,.

1147
01:19:10,229 --> 01:19:13,729
will the doctor give you tonic... or put up your report on the TV?

1148
01:19:14,167 --> 01:19:15,567
You see sir!?

1149
01:19:15,655 --> 01:19:21,956
so basically what you're saying is I must go to each one's room one-by-one and say results in their ears!

1150
01:19:23,012 --> 01:19:26,811
You've come first. You've come second. I'm so sorry, you failed!

1151
01:19:29,603 --> 01:19:31,702
No sir, I didn't mean that way

1152
01:19:31,740 --> 01:19:34,540
but the thing is..grade creates divide..divide

1153
01:19:35,799 --> 01:19:37,699
now see..I've come first so I'm sitting with you..

1154
01:19:37,774 --> 01:19:40,375
Whereas my friends have come last.
So they are seated in the last row... In a corner

1155
01:19:40,405 --> 01:19:44,905
At least they are sitting in a corner now. If they continue being with you,
next year they won't even be in the photo!

1156
01:19:44,934 --> 01:19:47,934
neither will they pass, nor any company will give them jobs!

1157
01:19:47,982 --> 01:19:49,803
sir, they'll find a job some how sir....

1158
01:19:49,817 --> 01:19:54,016
there will be at least few companies..
which hire people and not machines for work!

1159
01:19:55,147 --> 01:19:58,647
it's not like that sir..they'll find a job.. I guarentee

1160
01:19:59,309 --> 01:20:02,109
Oh.. You guarentee it.. You guarantee it!

1161
01:20:02,131 --> 01:20:03,530
You want to bet?

1162
01:20:06,933 --> 01:20:08,733
Govind....

1163
01:20:11,998 --> 01:20:15,898
if even one among those two get a job in the campus interview..

1164
01:20:16,345 --> 01:20:18,366
then shave my moustache!

1165
01:20:18,518 --> 01:20:19,918
ok sir!!

1166
01:20:21,396 --> 01:20:22,515
happy?

1167
01:20:24,932 --> 01:20:26,332
happy sir!

1168
01:20:30,060 --> 01:20:31,580
woahhhh!!!!..

1169
01:20:31,669 --> 01:20:34,470
by using car's horn.. You wanna hide your horn..idiot!

1170
01:20:34,520 --> 01:20:37,321
Idiot... Septic tank... You had the churan again...?

1171
01:20:37,358 --> 01:20:38,378
I didn't do it.

1172
01:20:38,391 --> 01:20:39,790
Raaaaju!!! huh.....

1173
01:20:39,827 --> 01:20:41,646
we've been very used to this hot air from those days..

1174
01:20:41,666 --> 01:20:45,166
This idiot is only responsible for global warming!
I can't take it!

1175
01:21:08,422 --> 01:21:11,723
Give me..give me your wallet..I'll go and buy a pant!

1176
01:21:11,732 --> 01:21:14,831
Leave it yaar..wear this Chatur Ramalingam's suit's pant!

1177
01:21:14,919 --> 01:21:17,020
hey don't you touch my suit!

1178
01:21:17,057 --> 01:21:19,157
leave it yaar..Rancho will recognise you even without the pant!

1179
01:21:19,233 --> 01:21:20,732
hey Mr., where's this address?

1180
01:21:20,817 --> 01:21:23,318
brother, if I was so educated... would I be selling groundnuts?

1181
01:21:23,336 --> 01:21:24,556
he doesn't know to read

1182
01:21:24,616 --> 01:21:26,117
but at least he knows to speak!

1183
01:21:26,155 --> 01:21:29,654
brother..here in Shimla..is there any Ranchhodas Chanchad?

1184
01:21:29,678 --> 01:21:32,277
yes..yes..he stays over there!

1185
01:21:32,371 --> 01:21:36,273
#....he was like the fleeting wind.....#

1186
01:21:36,306 --> 01:21:37,706
let's go!

1187
01:21:38,895 --> 01:21:43,494
#....like a fluttering kite.....#

1188
01:21:46,202 --> 01:21:50,603
#..... where did he go? let find him!......#

1189
01:21:50,676 --> 01:21:51,976
oye Chatur..here's is your bottle of churan!

1190
01:21:52,002 --> 01:21:53,102
Oh thanks..where did you find it?

1191
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:54,021
it was in the pocket!

1192
01:21:54,097 --> 01:21:55,297
hey..how dare you!? That's my pant.

1193
01:21:55,525 --> 01:21:57,524
hey, what's yours is mine ... it's written in Gita!

1194
01:21:57,611 --> 01:21:58,810
hey shut up... remove the pants

1195
01:21:58,821 --> 01:22:01,621
hey what are you doing yaar!..people will misinterpret!
Mad, idiot!

1196
01:22:01,781 --> 01:22:02,481
hey leave.

1197
01:22:02,539 --> 01:22:03,660
hey I want it now!

1198
01:22:18,164 --> 01:22:19,564
what happened?

1199
01:22:21,337 --> 01:22:22,738
Rancho's dad!

1200
01:22:25,701 --> 01:22:28,701
brother, where can I find Ranchhodas?

1201
01:22:28,788 --> 01:22:30,788
he's sitting over there...

1202
01:22:30,808 --> 01:22:32,208
thank you...

1203
01:22:53,665 --> 01:22:54,785
Rancho

1204
01:22:56,039 --> 01:22:56,758
yes

1205
01:22:57,166 --> 01:23:01,166
Oh sorry..  we wish to meet Ranchhodas

1206
01:23:01,589 --> 01:23:03,690
I'm only Ranchhodas..tel me?

1207
01:23:03,746 --> 01:23:07,345
no..Ranchhodas Shyamaldas Chanchad

1208
01:23:08,430 --> 01:23:11,730
I'm only Ranchhodas Shyamaldas Chanchad..tell me?

1209
01:23:16,516 --> 01:23:18,716
Rancho....take care of yourself!

1210
01:23:37,407 --> 01:23:39,227
Ranchhodas Chanchad!!!

1211
01:23:45,902 --> 01:23:47,022
Raju!!

1212
01:24:14,305 --> 01:24:19,007
yaar..i must be the first man in history who travelled from Delhi to Shimla in underwear that too ..to meet a wrong person!

1213
01:24:19,088 --> 01:24:22,087
yaar..the same name..the same degree.. And the same photo

1214
01:24:22,155 --> 01:24:25,654
but the person is different..what's the matter!..I'm unable to understand!

1215
01:24:25,754 --> 01:24:28,555
but from where did Silencer get Rancho's address?

1216
01:24:29,666 --> 01:24:30,787
yes!

1217
01:24:31,388 --> 01:24:33,207
oye Chatur!..come here

1218
01:24:34,601 --> 01:24:37,001
hey..hey..

1219
01:24:39,049 --> 01:24:42,248
how dare you open this..i got this from San Francisco

1220
01:24:42,256 --> 01:24:44,077
it's hand-made biscuit..

1221
01:24:45,762 --> 01:24:47,863
specially for Mr.Phunsuk Wangdu!

1222
01:24:48,129 --> 01:24:50,229
Phunsuk Bangdu... Now who is this?

1223
01:24:50,316 --> 01:24:54,815
Wangdu..Wangdu..'W'..'W'...Phunsuk Wangdu..

1224
01:24:54,860 --> 01:24:56,081
do you know who that is??

1225
01:24:56,248 --> 01:24:59,948
he's a great scientist...400 patents..the world wants him!

1226
01:25:00,654 --> 01:25:05,054
I have been chasing him from past one year.. And the meeting has been fixed now!

1227
01:25:05,121 --> 01:25:10,122
You know..once he signs a deal with my company..I'll be huge!..huge!

1228
01:25:10,653 --> 01:25:14,851
now stop praising this Wangdu and tell us from where did you get Rancho's address?

1229
01:25:14,919 --> 01:25:19,120
You should be thanking Phunsuk Wangdu..it's because of him, that I found a clue

1230
01:25:19,319 --> 01:25:26,421
see this..my secretary tracey was here last month to arrange a meeting with Phunsuk Wangdu

1231
01:25:27,092 --> 01:25:31,190
Tracey couldn't get an appointment with Phunsuk but I got Rancho

1232
01:25:31,276 --> 01:25:36,877
I checked Shimla's phone directory..in that the name was..Chanchad Ranchhodas

1233
01:25:36,951 --> 01:25:41,851
Then how did his appearance change?
He heard you are coming and got a plastic surgery done or what?

1234
01:25:44,343 --> 01:25:46,444
only one man can answer this!

1235
01:25:47,195 --> 01:25:49,495
I'm sorry dad.

1236
01:25:49,505 --> 01:25:51,604
I couldn't fulfill your last wish!

1237
01:25:53,207 --> 01:25:56,908
You kept on telling..take me to Haridwar..take me to Haridwar

1238
01:25:57,545 --> 01:26:01,046
but I was waiting for the highway's tender to be opened

1239
01:26:01,927 --> 01:26:03,927
the tender opened over there

1240
01:26:03,932 --> 01:26:06,233
and you closed your eyes over here!

1241
01:26:09,469 --> 01:26:10,989
I'm so sorry dad.

1242
01:26:12,602 --> 01:26:14,503
I could not be a good son!

1243
01:26:14,504 --> 01:26:16,124
what are you saying yaar?

1244
01:26:16,139 --> 01:26:18,938
You have become such a great engineer,
the degree's been put up on the wall

1245
01:26:18,983 --> 01:26:20,803
You are a very good son!

1246
01:26:22,451 --> 01:26:25,953
how dare you enter my property without my permission, huh?

1247
01:26:26,122 --> 01:26:27,542
I'll put you behind bars!

1248
01:26:27,592 --> 01:26:29,591
You'll go behind bars, idiot!

1249
01:26:29,631 --> 01:26:31,031
we have investigated everything.

1250
01:26:31,112 --> 01:26:34,512
on the basis of ICE degree, you're taking these highway contracts and hydro projects

1251
01:26:34,541 --> 01:26:38,042
this degree belongs to our friend..how did it come to you?

1252
01:26:51,430 --> 01:26:57,431
it's a 150 hectares property..I'll blow off your heads and bury you in a corner.. Nobody will get to know!..

1253
01:26:57,528 --> 01:26:59,628
Get the point!.. Now get lost!

1254
01:27:05,383 --> 01:27:10,380
I'm taking dad's ashes and going to Haridwar..if you say, I'll even take your bones along with that!

1255
01:27:16,991 --> 01:27:18,811
lift the dad!!!!

1256
01:27:21,508 --> 01:27:23,328
over there..there there

1257
01:27:26,768 --> 01:27:28,168
leave my dad!

1258
01:27:29,333 --> 01:27:30,453

1259
01:27:30,488 --> 01:27:33,089

1260
01:27:33,130 --> 01:27:34,249
handover dad to me!

1261
01:27:34,326 --> 01:27:36,126
dad's ashes won't go to Ganga... they'll go into the gutter!!

1262
01:27:36,329 --> 01:27:38,128
aeeee...remove dad from the pot...remove from the pot!

1263
01:27:38,272 --> 01:27:39,693
if you press the trigger then I'll press the flush!

1264
01:27:39,763 --> 01:27:41,264

1265
01:27:41,356 --> 01:27:43,856

1266
01:27:43,875 --> 01:27:45,695

1271
01:27:57,692 --> 01:27:58,811

1272
01:27:59,630 --> 01:28:02,431

1273
01:28:02,917 --> 01:28:04,317

1274
01:28:05,236 --> 01:28:06,056

1275
01:28:06,928 --> 01:28:08,848
empty... I'll empty it!

1276
01:28:08,908 --> 01:28:10,028
no no

1277
01:28:10,045 --> 01:28:12,545
I'll empty it... I'll empty it... I'm telling you. I'll empty it

1278
01:28:12,634 --> 01:28:15,254

1279
01:28:16,986 --> 01:28:19,687

1280
01:28:19,851 --> 01:28:21,751

1281
01:28:21,773 --> 01:28:22,772
aeeeeeeeeeee

1282
01:28:22,849 --> 01:28:25,048
No. I swear on dad. I swear on dad. I'm telling the truth yaar!

1283
01:28:25,085 --> 01:28:27,184
I'm Ranchhodas... he was Chote!

1284
01:28:27,923 --> 01:28:29,324
Chote??????

1285
01:28:30,178 --> 01:28:32,278
he was the son of our gardener..

1286
01:28:32,345 --> 01:28:34,845
everyone used to call him Chote!

1287
01:28:36,231 --> 01:28:39,732
even after his mom-dad passed away...dad let him stay in the house!

1288
01:28:40,899 --> 01:28:44,098
he used to do odd house-hold works.. You know

1289
01:28:44,819 --> 01:28:49,019
changing bulbs..getting eggs and bread..ironing..like

1290
01:28:50,163 --> 01:28:52,963
he was very much interested in studies!

1291
01:28:54,604 --> 01:28:58,105
he used to wear my old uniform and get into the school

1292
01:28:59,331 --> 01:29:02,831
whichever class he liked. he would go and sit in that one!

1293
01:29:02,911 --> 01:29:05,011
I used to take advantage of that..

1294
01:29:05,016 --> 01:29:07,317
I used to make him do my homework also

1295
01:29:07,410 --> 01:29:09,011
and make him write my exam papers also

1296
01:29:09,036 --> 01:29:11,135
I was having a good time!

1297
01:29:11,139 --> 01:29:12,339
then one day..

1298
01:29:12,359 --> 01:29:16,758
Master Ji saw that a sixth standard child was solving a tenth standard problem

1299
01:29:17,160 --> 01:29:20,862
Which class you are in, son? What's your name?

1300
01:29:21,553 --> 01:29:23,152
we were caught

1301
01:29:23,337 --> 01:29:28,738
Dad was a big man so Master Ji thought it's better to tell him before telling the principal!

1302
01:29:29,050 --> 01:29:32,750
You've beginned this..then you only will end it!

1303
01:29:35,201 --> 01:29:38,002
the whole himachal salutes in front of me..

1304
01:29:38,778 --> 01:29:41,777
but as soon as I turn away....behind my back,

1305
01:29:41,836 --> 01:29:43,936
they call me an illiterate!

1306
01:29:44,235 --> 01:29:46,336
this won't happen with my son!

1307
01:29:47,194 --> 01:29:52,194
he wants education...and me..just..degree

1308
01:29:52,267 --> 01:29:56,268
let it continue as it is...make this boy an engineer

1309
01:29:57,589 --> 01:30:02,786
Ranchhodas Chanchad's degree..over there..on that wall I want

1310
01:30:03,454 --> 01:30:07,755
I went away to london for four years .. And he kept studying in ICE using my name

1311
01:30:08,397 --> 01:30:11,898
he had a deal with my dad that after getting a degree from ICE

1312
01:30:11,939 --> 01:30:15,440
he won't meet anyone from ICE in his whole lifetime!

1313
01:30:16,641 --> 01:30:22,339
he usually said..i won't go meet anyone..but one day two idiots will come searching for me

1314
01:30:23,834 --> 01:30:25,655
then what will you do?

1315
01:30:29,474 --> 01:30:31,294
he misses you both a lot!

1316
01:30:33,216 --> 01:30:35,317
I'll give you the address..

1317
01:30:35,944 --> 01:30:37,344

1318
01:30:39,828 --> 01:30:43,028

1319
01:30:45,170 --> 01:30:46,569

1320
01:30:57,816 --> 01:30:59,215

01:31:06,104 --> 01:31:07,423

1324
01:31:07,472 --> 01:31:10,472
aare it's a very complicated story and it is without subtitles
You can't understand...

1325
01:31:10,626 --> 01:31:11,745
ignore it..ignore it

1326
01:31:11,837 --> 01:31:13,659

1327
01:31:13,993 --> 01:31:14,993

1328
01:31:15,039 --> 01:31:16,439
ladakh?..why??

1329
01:31:17,093 --> 01:31:18,112

1330
01:31:18,115 --> 01:31:19,435
is he in ladakh?

1331
01:31:19,513 --> 01:31:21,213

1332
01:31:21,230 --> 01:31:24,830

1333
01:31:24,887 --> 01:31:27,688
school teacher..he he he..master ji!

1334
01:31:28,533 --> 01:31:31,333
I'm vice-president of rockledge corporation!

1335
01:31:31,352 --> 01:31:34,153
and he..A for apple..B for Ball

1336
01:31:34,456 --> 01:31:36,055
D for donkey

1337
01:31:36,145 --> 01:31:41,144
next week, I'll be signing a multi-million dollar deal with phunshuk Wangdu!

1338
01:31:41,146 --> 01:31:43,747
and he..A for apple..B for ball

1339
01:31:47,661 --> 01:31:50,661
today, my respect grew even more for that Idiot Rancho!

1340
01:31:51,145 --> 01:31:53,766
we all went to college only to get a degree....

1341
01:31:53,808 --> 01:31:55,627
if we don't have a degree, we won't have a job!

1342
01:31:55,690 --> 01:31:57,989
if you don't have a job, no father will give his daughter's hand

1343
01:31:58,043 --> 01:32:00,842
bank won't give credit card, and world won't respect us...

1344
01:32:01,194 --> 01:32:04,596
but that idiot came to college, not for the degree but to study!

1345
01:32:05,263 --> 01:32:08,763
he wasn't afraid to come last or greedy to come first!

1346
01:32:08,821 --> 01:32:11,321
who was the first man to step on the moon?

1347
01:32:11,419 --> 01:32:13,239
Neil Armstrong sir!

1348
01:32:13,275 --> 01:32:16,775
obviously it's Neil Armstrong, we all know it..but who was the second man?

1349
01:32:16,873 --> 01:32:18,873
don't waste your time, it's not important!

1350
01:32:18,947 --> 01:32:21,748
nobody remembers the man who ever came second!

1351
01:32:21,775 --> 01:32:27,773
after two monthes..26 companies will come to this college to offer jobs to you all!

1352
01:32:27,900 --> 01:32:31,402
that means before your final exams,

1353
01:32:31,344 --> 01:32:33,444
you'll have jobs on your hands!

1354
01:32:34,124 --> 01:32:36,223
this is your last act my friends!

1355
01:32:36,463 --> 01:32:40,664
put the medal on the pedal..press the accelerator
go out there and make history

1356
01:32:43,526 --> 01:32:44,926
any questions?

1357
01:32:47,177 --> 01:32:48,297
yes..

1358
01:32:49,197 --> 01:32:53,398
sir, suppose any student gets a job and.....

1359
01:32:54,362 --> 01:32:57,962
he fails in the finals by 1-2 marks..

1360
01:32:58,246 --> 01:33:00,546
then will the job remain or....?

1361
01:33:00,814 --> 01:33:02,634
very good question

1362
01:33:04,758 --> 01:33:08,259
is there any other person, in whose mind, the same question is arising?

1363
01:33:08,828 --> 01:33:10,228
as expected

1364
01:33:12,725 --> 01:33:17,423
please come on stage, everyone give them a big hand..come on the stage..come

1365
01:33:21,355 --> 01:33:23,455
come...come..don't waste time!

1366
01:33:26,356 --> 01:33:31,657
from past four years, they have been the most consistent students of ICE!

1367
01:33:31,745 --> 01:33:35,244
because consistently, they've come last in every exam

1368
01:33:35,640 --> 01:33:37,460
come my geniuses..come

1369
01:33:38,235 --> 01:33:43,435
if we remove these two people's brains and sell in the market, we'll get a very gud price!

1370
01:33:44,321 --> 01:33:47,821
because they are unused brain.. Never have been used!

1371
01:33:49,348 --> 01:33:51,248
n to answer to their question

1372
01:33:51,468 --> 01:33:54,967
whether they paas or fail, it's not gonna affect their jobs

1373
01:33:55,007 --> 01:33:57,809
because they are not gonna get jobs at all!

1374
01:33:57,835 --> 01:33:59,235
I guarentee it

1375
01:33:59,964 --> 01:34:02,764
their names will be written in gold

1376
01:34:02,816 --> 01:34:05,615
FARHANITRATE and PRERAJULISATION!..

01:34:05,686 --> 01:34:08,487

collective rape you know..in front of..in front of everyone!

1380
01:34:23,255 --> 01:34:28,455
God...I'll stop eating non-veg..I'll light thousands of incense sticks!

1381
01:34:28,547 --> 01:34:30,367
do only one thing..

1382
01:34:30,405 --> 01:34:32,504
take away VIRUS from this world!

1383
01:34:34,311 --> 01:34:36,131
burn him in hell..

1384
01:34:37,498 --> 01:34:41,298
make hot pakkodas of him in hot oil....God..

1385
01:34:41,647 --> 01:34:42,767
aeee

1386
01:34:43,135 --> 01:34:45,135
are you giving God a contract to kill?

1387
01:34:45,209 --> 01:34:47,310
idiot you sit quietly, huh..

1388
01:34:47,377 --> 01:34:49,676
idiot every year you sit in the centre with VIRUS and take photo

1389
01:34:49,729 --> 01:34:51,827
while we'll be rotting in the side

1390
01:34:52,785 --> 01:34:55,886
this year I think we'll be finished out of the photo itself!

1391
01:34:55,973 --> 01:34:57,573
aee..

1392
01:34:57,931 --> 01:34:59,532
do you know why I come first?

1393
01:34:59,588 --> 01:35:00,308
why?

1394
01:35:00,312 --> 01:35:02,412
because I'm in love with machines

1395
01:35:02,632 --> 01:35:04,733
engineering is my passion..passion

1396
01:35:05,491 --> 01:35:07,591
do you know what's your passion?

1397
01:35:09,205 --> 01:35:10,224
hey that's my bag..

1398
01:35:10,266 --> 01:35:12,086

1400
01:35:13,954 --> 01:35:15,075

01:35:15,555 --> 01:35:17,655
this is your passion..this..this

1402
01:35:18,730 --> 01:35:20,850
go and post this letter..

1403
01:35:20,930 --> 01:35:22,330
but what is it?

1404
01:35:24,325 --> 01:35:28,825
5 years ago, he had written this letter to his favorite wild life photographer!

1405
01:35:28,868 --> 01:35:30,468
Andre Isthawa

1406
01:35:31,085 --> 01:35:32,485
ya... Isthawa

1407
01:35:32,568 --> 01:35:36,068
he wanted to go to him..go to Hungary and learn work from him!

1408
01:35:36,869 --> 01:35:41,069
but fearing his dad, due to Hitler Qureshi, he never posted the letter at all!

1409
01:35:41,848 --> 01:35:45,649
aare..quit engineering.. And become a wild life photographer!

1410
01:35:46,376 --> 01:35:49,175
do that work which you are talented in!

1411
01:35:51,315 --> 01:35:55,316
if Lata Mangeshkar's dad would have told her to become a fast bowler

1412
01:35:55,790 --> 01:35:59,289
or Sachin Tendulkar's father would have told him to be a singer.

1413
01:35:59,799 --> 01:36:02,600
then think... where would they stand today?!

1414
01:36:03,399 --> 01:36:06,199
are you understanding, what I'm sayin?

1415
01:36:09,242 --> 01:36:12,042
Idiot..he loves animals but is marrying machines!

1416
01:36:12,920 --> 01:36:14,040
ae

1417
01:36:16,807 --> 01:36:17,927
baba Ranchhodas..

1418
01:36:19,388 --> 01:36:23,389
my girlfriend and wife..both are engineering

1419
01:36:24,544 --> 01:36:26,563
then why do I come last...say?

1420
01:36:28,254 --> 01:36:30,754
because you are a coward... coward

1421
01:36:31,959 --> 01:36:36,859
see this..see his hand..the fingers are less..and the rings are more

1422
01:36:36,942 --> 01:36:40,443
one for exam..one for sister's marriage and one for job

1423
01:36:41,486 --> 01:36:45,485
aare..if you fear so much from the future.. You think you can live?

1424
01:36:45,734 --> 01:36:47,833
and where will you focus on today?

1425
01:36:48,511 --> 01:36:49,711
I've got weird friends yaar

1426
01:36:49,882 --> 01:36:52,684
one fears and lives..and one idiot..dies and lives!

1427
01:36:52,782 --> 01:36:53,502
heyy

1428
01:36:53,535 --> 01:36:55,635
but you idiot..do both the things..

1429
01:36:55,688 --> 01:36:57,808
You fear also and die also...

1430
01:36:57,855 --> 01:36:59,075
ae..i don't fear!

1431
01:36:59,373 --> 01:37:00,773
hey..listen

1432
01:37:00,944 --> 01:37:04,044
he dies on Pia and fears to tell

1433
01:37:04,245 --> 01:37:05,865
aaaaahahaaa...

1434
01:37:06,293 --> 01:37:08,113
go go..get lost

1435
01:37:08,927 --> 01:37:12,927
it's easy to give free advise dude but difficult to follow it

1436
01:37:12,988 --> 01:37:15,808
if you dare..then go and tell Pia..tel

1437
01:37:16,278 --> 01:37:18,878

listen to me..listen to me

1440
01:37:22,353 --> 01:37:26,052
what I say is..if you go and tell Pia about what you feeling

1441
01:37:26,099 --> 01:37:30,301
then even I'll go and tel my dad that I wanna be a photographer..
and don't wanna be an engineer

1442
01:37:30,304 --> 01:37:31,424
yes

1443
01:37:31,457 --> 01:37:34,956

1464
01:39:02,280 --> 01:39:04,280
Pia,

1465
01:39:05,096 --> 01:39:08,796
the 22minutes that I spent with you on the scooter

1466
01:39:09,221 --> 01:39:14,221
those were the most beautiful 22minutes of my life!

1467
01:39:18,383 --> 01:39:23,403
i can spend the rest of my life on the scooter with you

1468
01:39:23,748 --> 01:39:24,868

1469
01:39:25,896 --> 01:39:27,996
#.......everything is still.......#

1470
01:39:29,662 --> 01:39:36,664
do you know.. You come on scooter everyday wearing a bride's costume in my dreams!

1471
01:39:39,685 --> 01:39:43,484
instead of the veil... takes off your helmet!

1472
01:39:45,189 --> 01:39:48,690
and you come near me to kiss me

1473
01:39:50,411 --> 01:39:53,511
but that kiss won't happen yaar...

1474
01:39:54,134 --> 01:39:55,254
why?

1475
01:39:55,343 --> 01:39:58,142
beacuse nose comes in between and then I wake up

1476
01:39:59,222 --> 01:40:02,022
nose doesn't come in between, stupid

1477
01:40:05,099 --> 01:40:09,099
I'm sorry... I thought you were Pia..

1478
01:40:09,504 --> 01:40:10,904
I wish I was

1479
01:40:10,964 --> 01:40:12,764
Sister, why did you interrupt in between?

1480
01:40:12,830 --> 01:40:14,831

1481
01:40:14,920 --> 01:40:17,340

1482

sister

1486
01:40:23,622 --> 01:40:25,022
who are you?

1487
01:40:33,978 --> 01:40:37,477
Do you know... when you were speaking... he kicked... first time!

1488
01:40:37,745 --> 01:40:41,646
He... how do you know it's a he or a she?

1489
01:40:41,719 --> 01:40:42,920
Dad had asked the astrologer..

1490
01:40:43,217 --> 01:40:46,216
He wanted to know, is an engineer coming home or a doctor?

1491
01:40:46,645 --> 01:40:47,565
Means?

1492
01:40:47,852 --> 01:40:51,051
Means if it's a boy, then it's an engineer and if it's a gal, then it's a doctor

1493
01:40:51,078 --> 01:40:56,380
oye champ.. You stay inside itself..outside there's a lot of circus!

1494
01:40:57,119 --> 01:41:02,619
and the circus's ringmaster, your granfather will spin the hunter and say run!

1495
01:41:03,250 --> 01:41:06,251
life is a race..run..be an engineer

1496
01:41:07,093 --> 01:41:10,493
but you become whatever your heart says

1497
01:41:11,032 --> 01:41:12,852
if he scares you too much

1498
01:41:12,987 --> 01:41:16,085
keep a hand on your heart and say: AAL IZ WELL!

1499
01:41:16,769 --> 01:41:18,168

01:41:52,347 --> 01:41:54,167
pigeon go go go

1510
01:41:54,521 --> 01:41:55,921
Who's there?

1511
01:41:57,207 --> 01:41:58,607

01:42:03,150 --> 01:42:04,550

1514
01:42:06,321 --> 01:42:08,422
security..that way..that way!!!

1515
01:42:35,498 --> 01:42:39,898
so you all have already learnt about the simple pendulum

1516
01:42:39,923 --> 01:42:43,423
now let's get down to the advanced study about compound pendulum

1517
01:42:44,093 --> 01:42:48,795
it's an irregular object oscillating about its own axis

1518
01:42:48,813 --> 01:42:50,632
let me demonstrate to you

1519
01:42:51,064 --> 01:42:52,064
what's this??

1520
01:42:52,145 --> 01:42:52,964
pencil

1521
01:42:53,051 --> 01:42:53,970
what's inside it?

1522
01:42:54,004 --> 01:42:54,624
lead!

1523
01:42:54,643 --> 01:42:56,863
good!  lead is the axis to this pencil

1524
01:42:57,328 --> 01:43:01,028
even you can be a compound pendulum if you osscilate about

1525
01:43:07,093 --> 01:43:08,713
where is Raju Rastogi?

1526

01:52:35,772 --> 01:52:36,192

01:52:38,120 --> 01:52:39,620
Oh..so you gonna go with me?

1656
01:52:44,212 --> 01:52:46,313
Idiot...why will I go home?

1657
01:52:46,626 --> 01:52:48,427

1658
01:52:48,799 --> 01:52:51,598
we had promised something to this idiot!

1659
01:52:53,430 --> 01:52:55,651

1660
01:52:56,853 --> 01:52:57,673
why?

1661
01:52:57,751 --> 01:53:01,952
give it..i don't think after reading this, you'll be able to go for the interview!

1662
01:53:02,536 --> 01:53:03,436
what is this?

1663
01:53:03,444 --> 01:53:04,544
it's a letter

1664
01:53:04,579 --> 01:53:06,679
It came for you. From hungary!

1665
01:53:06,738 --> 01:53:09,537
it's some photographer..Andre Isthawan!

1666
01:53:16,532 --> 01:53:18,631
idiots.. You posted my letter?

1667
01:53:18,709 --> 01:53:21,508
he liked your photos very much..he's become crazy!

1668
01:53:21,801 --> 01:53:23,902
he wants to make you his assistant!

1669
01:53:23,941 --> 01:53:27,442
He has called you to work in the Brazilian rainforest for one year!

1670
01:53:27,513 --> 01:53:30,312
He's saying he'll even give you salary!

1671
01:53:44,278 --> 01:53:46,098
Dad won't oblige!

1672
01:53:47,856 --> 01:53:50,855
Go to him. And make him understand lovingly.

1673
01:53:51,948 --> 01:53:53,768
Don't fear today Farhan.

1674
01:53:53,864 --> 01:53:57,364
Otherwise after 50yrs when you'll be old and fallen in the hospital...

1675
01:53:57,519 --> 01:53:58,839
and be waiting to die

1676
01:53:59,171 --> 01:54:02,872
You'll think then. letter was in the hand. taxi was at the gate.

1677
01:54:03,286 --> 01:54:06,786
if I had dared a little bit. life would have been something else!

1678
01:54:12,784 --> 01:54:15,284
what do you think, will he like it?

1679
01:54:15,330 --> 01:54:18,131
what was the need to get such an expensive one!

1680
01:54:18,597 --> 01:54:20,797
today, son is getting a job

1681
01:54:22,237 --> 01:54:26,436
now the days to put our head up and roam wid pride are arriving and you are being stingy! huh?

1682
01:54:27,866 --> 01:54:29,266
aare Farhan?

1683
01:54:32,208 --> 01:54:36,208
Farhan, today was your interview, right?

1684
01:54:37,332 --> 01:54:38,732
I didn't go

1685
01:54:41,142 --> 01:54:43,243
i don't wanna be an engineer dad!

1686
01:54:46,640 --> 01:54:49,440
what happened? You had an an accident?

1687
01:54:49,496 --> 01:54:51,497
sir... Umm...

1688
01:54:52,460 --> 01:54:54,560
that building in front sir.

1689
01:54:55,455 --> 01:54:58,254
I had jumped from its third floor sir!

1690
01:54:59,684 --> 01:55:00,805
why?

1691
01:55:01,240 --> 01:55:03,340
because I was restigated!

1692
01:55:05,841 --> 01:55:06,962
why?

1693
01:55:07,045 --> 01:55:11,746
sir I had pissed on director's door when I was in a drunken state...

1694
01:55:14,343 --> 01:55:17,842
that devil Rancho is still playing with your brain?

1695
01:55:17,916 --> 01:55:22,118
I can't understand engineering...even if I'll be...I'll be a very bad engineer dad!

1696
01:55:23,595 --> 01:55:25,694
Rancho tells a very simple thing.

1697
01:55:25,777 --> 01:55:27,877
whatever you enjoy doing, make that your profession!

1698
01:55:27,907 --> 01:55:29,907
then work won't seem work but a game!

1699
01:55:29,976 --> 01:55:31,977
aare..how much will you earn in that jungle?

1700
01:55:32,404 --> 01:55:35,904
dad, stipend isn't too much but I'll get to learn a lot!

1701
01:55:35,993 --> 01:55:40,994
after 5 years, when you'll see your friends buying a car

1702
01:55:41,038 --> 01:55:42,357
then you'll curse yourself!

1703
01:55:42,438 --> 01:55:44,938
I'll be frustrated being an engineer,

1704
01:55:45,022 --> 01:55:47,821
then I'll curse you throughout my life!

1705
01:55:48,237 --> 01:55:50,238
Dad, it's better I curse myself, right?

1706
01:55:50,347 --> 01:55:52,447
aare..people will laugh!!

1707
01:55:52,893 --> 01:55:54,593
they'll say that you came till final year and had quit!

1708
01:55:55,445 --> 01:55:58,947
That Kapoor sir told me that you're lucky that your son is studying in ICE!

1709
01:55:59,484 --> 01:56:00,804
what will he think?

1710
01:56:00,872 --> 01:56:03,670
Kapoor sir didn't get AC fixed in my room!

1711
01:56:05,927 --> 01:56:09,429
making me sleep comfortably...he himself didn't sleep in heat!

1712
01:56:09,909 --> 01:56:13,409
making me sit on the shoulders...Kapoor sir didn't take me around the zoo!

1713
01:56:15,723 --> 01:56:17,543
you did all that dad!

1714
01:56:19,373 --> 01:56:21,473
what you think, makes a difference!

1715
01:56:22,332 --> 01:56:25,332
what Kapoor sir thinks, it doesn't make a difference to me!

1716
01:56:25,556 --> 01:56:27,557
aare... I don't even know his first name!

1717
01:56:27,558 --> 01:56:30,557
have you watched a film and come...
are you performing drama?

1718
01:56:30,569 --> 01:56:32,669
stop it now. poor guy is tensed!

1719
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,802
God forbid, if he commits something like Raju!

1720
01:56:36,834 --> 01:56:38,634
then the discussion is only over!

1721
01:56:38,706 --> 01:56:42,205
don't say anything to son or else he'll jump from the terrace!

1722
01:56:45,593 --> 01:56:48,895
no dad... I won't commit suicide.

1723
01:56:49,800 --> 01:56:51,200
I promise!

1724
01:56:52,405 --> 01:56:53,904
That Rancho,

1725
01:56:53,987 --> 01:56:55,807
whom you call a devil.

1726
01:56:56,384 --> 01:56:59,885
he forcibly made me put yours and mom's photo in this!

1727
01:57:01,027 --> 01:57:04,547
he started saying that....promise me....that whenever such stupid thoughts come to your mind!

1728
01:57:04,641 --> 01:57:09,741
see this photo and think what will happen to this smile when they see your dead body!

1729
01:57:15,028 --> 01:57:19,028
dad, I wanna convince you.

1730
01:57:20,021 --> 01:57:23,519
but not by hanging this suicide's sword on your head!

1731
01:57:25,791 --> 01:57:28,391
what will happen.... huh?

1732
01:57:28,811 --> 01:57:34,311
If I'd be a photographer... then I'll earn less, right? Home will be small, car will be small!

1733
01:57:35,393 --> 01:57:38,193
But dad, I'll be happy...

1734
01:57:38,736 --> 01:57:40,555
I will be really happy!

1735
01:57:41,193 --> 01:57:43,992
Whatever I do for you. I'll do it from my heart!

1736
01:57:44,727 --> 01:57:50,328
Till today... I have listened to whatever you said, today... just once... let me listen to my heart!

1737
01:57:51,744 --> 01:57:53,144
Please dad!

1738
01:57:59,006 --> 01:58:02,327
Dad... Don't go... Please!

1739
01:58:07,842 --> 01:58:09,662
Return this one..

1740
01:58:12,387 --> 01:58:15,189
Son, how much will your professional camera cost?

1741
01:58:16,457 --> 01:58:19,256
Will we get it against this laptop?

1742
01:58:19,312 --> 01:58:22,112
If it costs more money, then ask me son

1743
01:58:29,480 --> 01:58:31,299
Go... Go son... Live your life

1744
01:58:34,452 --> 01:58:38,671
Your marks are consistenly poor... any particular reason?

1745
01:58:38,746 --> 01:58:42,767
Due to fear... I was a bright student since childhood

1746
01:58:43,230 --> 01:58:46,030
parents thought that it will abolish our poverty!

1747
01:58:46,109 --> 01:58:47,929
I started to fear!

1748
01:58:49,407 --> 01:58:54,308
when I came here.. I saw that there's a race,.. if you don't come first, no one will recognize you

1749
01:58:54,326 --> 01:58:56,426
I started to fear even more!

1750
01:58:56,666 --> 01:58:58,765
fear is not good for grade, sir!

1751
01:58:58,850 --> 01:59:01,871
I started wearing more rings... praying more

1752
01:59:01,898 --> 01:59:04,598
not only praying... I started begging to God

1753
01:59:04,999 --> 01:59:07,100
Give me this, give me that!

1754
01:59:09,001 --> 01:59:14,002
16 bones broke, I got two months to think..then I understood!

1755
01:59:15,638 --> 01:59:18,038
sir, today I haven't told God... that get me this job

1756
01:59:18,118 --> 01:59:21,618
I just folded my hands. And said thank you for this life

1757
01:59:22,962 --> 01:59:26,462
If you guys. If you guys even reject me today, then I don't have any regrets

1758
01:59:26,478 --> 01:59:31,479
Because I believe..I'll somehow do something worthy with my life sir!

1759
01:59:31,557 --> 01:59:36,556
see..this very much frank behaviour of yours is not good for our company!

1760
01:59:36,996 --> 01:59:40,997
we need a diplomatic person to handle the clients

1761
01:59:41,060 --> 01:59:43,160
and you are way too straight forward!

1762
01:59:45,034 --> 01:59:53,234
but..if you assure us that you can control this attitude of yours..

1763
01:59:53,243 --> 01:59:56,543
then..something can happen!!!

1764
01:59:56,563 --> 01:59:57,683
sure

1765
01:59:59,817 --> 02:00:03,316
after breaking both the limbs, I learnt to stand on my feet sir,

1766
02:00:04,151 --> 02:00:07,850
with great difficulty, I got this attitude in me!..it can't happen sir!

1767
02:00:11,296 --> 02:00:16,295
you keep your job, I'll keep my attitude

1768
02:00:16,372 --> 02:00:18,472
I'm sorry..don't mind sir!

1769
02:00:21,829 --> 02:00:22,949

02:00:24,675 --> 02:00:28,176

there are so many people over here..all of them will laugh!!

1924
02:10:18,650 --> 02:10:20,550
aare, because people laugh... so will you suicide?

1925
02:10:20,567 --> 02:10:21,587
aare..Rastogi?

1926
02:10:21,636 --> 02:10:25,137
Pia.. people will gossip for two days and forget it!

1927
02:10:25,215 --> 02:10:28,916
but today if you do this marriage..you never forget that car was at the gate!

1928
02:10:28,984 --> 02:10:32,982
we had come to take you to Rancho..but only because you feared from people

1929
02:10:33,068 --> 02:10:35,167
you got married to this donkey!

1930
02:10:36,713 --> 02:10:37,833
house keeping?

1931
02:11:15,879 --> 02:11:18,678
yaar Pia..there is a small..minor tension.

1932
02:11:18,774 --> 02:11:19,894
what?

1933
02:11:20,044 --> 02:11:22,043
we don't know if Rancho's married or not?

1934
02:11:22,059 --> 02:11:22,679
what!

1935
02:11:22,746 --> 02:11:24,047
aare, I wouldn't have happened yaar. it wouldn't have happened!

1936
02:11:24,052 --> 02:11:25,852
and if it would've happened?

1937
02:11:25,945 --> 02:11:27,766
then we'll drop you back!

1938
02:11:28,188 --> 02:11:30,087
aare, don't take tension. have this biscuit

1939
02:11:30,158 --> 02:11:31,958
hand-made biscuit from San Francisco

1940
02:11:32,232 --> 02:11:33,552
Idiot,,,.

1941
02:11:35,450 --> 02:11:37,270
from where did he come?

1942
02:11:37,308 --> 02:11:38,328
ignore it..ignore it..

1943
02:11:38,362 --> 02:11:39,362

1944
02:11:39,523 --> 02:11:40,524

1945
02:11:40,572 --> 02:11:41,572
AAL IZ WELL... AAL IZ WELL!

1946
02:11:41,634 --> 02:11:43,755
Till yesterday I was a noble citizen of this country

1947
02:11:43,839 --> 02:11:47,438
but in the last 24hours. I had got an emergency landing of a plane

1948
02:11:48,054 --> 02:11:50,853
almost immersed Shyamalda's soul in the gutter

1949
02:11:50,917 --> 02:11:53,719
and kidnapped a bride from her wedding

1950
02:11:53,783 --> 02:11:55,383
all for that idiot Rancho

1951
02:11:56,220 --> 02:11:58,620
but even that idiot gave out his heart for his friends

1952
02:11:59,120 --> 02:12:02,220
he had entered Ravan's territory, to steal a question paper for Raju

1953
02:12:02,305 --> 02:12:03,606
search for a red sealed envelope

1954
02:12:03,689 --> 02:12:04,689
ok come...

1955
02:12:04,724 --> 02:12:09,222
he was very afraid..that if Raju failed, he'll again go and do a high-jump!

1956
02:12:11,873 --> 02:12:14,174
but even we were very principled robbers!

1957
02:12:14,375 --> 02:12:18,576
we had sweared that we'll steal the paper oly for Raju...we won't even see it ourselves!

1958
02:12:21,067 --> 02:12:22,667
aare yaar, where has he hidden it?

1959
02:12:22,681 --> 02:12:24,481
aare yaar, searching like this, it'll be good morning

1960
02:12:24,568 --> 02:12:25,888
Rancho, ask Pia

1961
02:12:29,125 --> 02:12:31,126

1962
02:12:32,225 --> 02:12:33,625

02:14:22,142 --> 02:14:25,142
then making me do things that are odd...

1986
02:14:29,029 --> 02:14:31,828
if I pass, it'll be on my own ability!

1987
02:14:33,489 --> 02:14:35,589
otherwise it's okay if I fail!

1988
02:14:51,036 --> 02:14:52,156
Idiot!

1989
02:14:52,219 --> 02:14:56,220
idiot won my heart! My heart said I'll make this idiot my brother-in-law

1990
02:14:56,298 --> 02:14:59,097

1991
02:15:17,232 --> 02:15:18,631

02:15:18,681 --> 02:15:20,500

You'll piss on my door

1995
02:15:30,430 --> 02:15:31,830

1996
02:15:32,458 --> 02:15:33,858

1998
02:15:40,721 --> 02:15:42,541
I'll call the police

1999
02:15:44,100 --> 02:15:47,200
rascals..rascals all of you!

2000
02:15:50,887 --> 02:15:52,988
how did he get my office's key?

2001
02:15:54,050 --> 02:15:55,870
I gave him the keys dad

2002
02:15:56,446 --> 02:15:59,245
I wish I had given it to my brother

2003
02:15:59,344 --> 02:16:00,444
he would have been alive today..

2004
02:16:00,539 --> 02:16:01,939
stop it Pia

2005
02:16:02,121 --> 02:16:05,523
what do you think?..brother, fell off the train and died?

2006
02:16:05,661 --> 02:16:06,461
shut up Pia

2007
02:16:06,527 --> 02:16:08,526
you decided that he'll be an engineer.....

2008
02:16:08,543 --> 02:16:11,342
did you ever ask him, what he wanted to be?

2009
02:16:11,736 --> 02:16:13,737
how much you pressurised brother, dad..

2010
02:16:13,755 --> 02:16:17,556
he thought it's easier to die than to give an entrance exam!

2011
02:16:19,731 --> 02:16:21,251
what is she saying?

2012
02:16:21,332 --> 02:16:23,032
dad, you go into the room!

2013
02:16:23,084 --> 02:16:24,904
you get into your room!

2014
02:16:27,785 --> 02:16:31,786
Pia stop it..what are you doing Pia?..I'm telling you right..

2015
02:16:32,097 --> 02:16:36,497
brother wanted to study literature..he wanted to be a writer

2016
02:16:38,252 --> 02:16:40,751
but he couldn't write anything more than this suicide note!

2017
02:16:40,893 --> 02:16:41,894
Pia, hide that letter..please!

2018
02:16:41,960 --> 02:16:44,061
till when will I hide it sister?

2019
02:16:46,809 --> 02:16:47,929
once

2020
02:16:49,069 --> 02:16:51,169
only once if you would have told him

2021
02:16:51,590 --> 02:16:54,592
if you can do engineering then quit it!

2022
02:16:54,679 --> 02:16:56,498
do whatever you like!

2023
02:16:57,092 --> 02:16:59,891
then today brother would have been alive, dad!

2024
02:17:06,936 --> 02:17:08,756
he cannot suicide

2025
02:17:09,046 --> 02:17:13,146
you're right dad, it wasn't a suicide...

2026
02:17:14,820 --> 02:17:16,739
it was a murder!

2027
02:17:31,129 --> 02:17:36,329

2028

Rancho, when there were no hospitals and doctors in this world even then babies were born...

02:19:18,423 --> 02:19:20,622

02:19:46,558 --> 02:19:48,577
push..push..come on..

2069
02:19:49,398 --> 02:19:50,598
push....

2070
02:19:50,835 --> 02:19:52,734
keep quiet..I'm unable to push

2071
02:19:52,962 --> 02:19:55,363
Rancho, see if crowning is happening?

2072
02:19:55,478 --> 02:19:57,298
crowning means?

2073
02:19:57,639 --> 02:19:59,459
go get that diagram

2074
02:20:01,390 --> 02:20:04,191
Rancho, see if the head is coming out

2075
02:20:06,371 --> 02:20:08,190
come on Rancho..quickly

2076
02:20:08,296 --> 02:20:09,695
Gooooooo

2077
02:20:09,734 --> 02:20:12,333
Go go go..go Rancho..go..come on

2078
02:20:19,303 --> 02:20:21,603
No. No crowning. It's not coming. No

2079
02:20:21,639 --> 02:20:23,459
sister.. please push

2080
02:20:26,037 --> 02:20:27,437
Mona..

2081
02:20:27,767 --> 02:20:28,886
Mona

2082
02:20:29,661 --> 02:20:31,081
she's tired Pia..

2083
02:20:31,151 --> 02:20:32,351
wake her up

2084
02:20:32,351 --> 02:20:34,952
if she doesn't push, then it'll be a big problem

2085
02:20:34,960 --> 02:20:37,059
vacuum cup has to be put, Pia

2086
02:20:37,102 --> 02:20:38,902
from where will they get a vacuum cup over there...

2087
02:20:38,929 --> 02:20:41,929
what is a vacuum cup?..how does it look?..what do they do with it?

2088
02:20:41,987 --> 02:20:43,388
I'll show u

2089
02:20:45,653 --> 02:20:49,852
if the mother gets tired and is unable to push then this cup is put on the baby's head

2090
02:20:49,897 --> 02:20:53,399
suction pump creates vacuum and this cup sticks on the baby's head

2091
02:20:54,157 --> 02:20:56,256
then the baby is pulled out

2092
02:20:56,701 --> 02:20:58,401
i can make this..i can make it

2093
02:20:58,411 --> 02:20:59,231
how?

2094
02:20:59,250 --> 02:21:00,269
vacuum cleaner sir..

2095
02:21:00,324 --> 02:21:00,944
vacuum cleaner??..

2096
02:21:00,983 --> 02:21:01,903
yes sir..vacuum cleaner

2097
02:21:01,979 --> 02:21:04,280
but vacuum cleaner's pressure is too much Rancho

2098
02:21:04,324 --> 02:21:05,224
I'll control the pressure

2099
02:21:05,268 --> 02:21:06,369

2192
02:27:53,005 --> 02:27:56,404
but when that idiot opened his mouth, then a miracle happened!

2193
02:27:56,453 --> 02:27:59,654
solid you kick.. will you become a footballer or what?

2194
02:27:59,710 --> 02:28:03,311

stop....where are you going?..

2196
02:28:21,300 --> 02:28:23,400
I'm not finished with you,

2197
02:28:24,666 --> 02:28:27,867
on the first day of college, you had asked me a question....remember?

2198
02:28:27,903 --> 02:28:30,703
that why don't they use a pencil in the space.

2199
02:28:30,788 --> 02:28:34,987
if the tip of the pencil breaks in the space, then it will be revolving under the action of gravity

2200
02:28:35,008 --> 02:28:37,409
it can get into someone's eyes, it can get into someone's nose

2201
02:28:37,494 --> 02:28:39,194
it can get into the instrument panel.

2202
02:28:39,249 --> 02:28:41,349
you were wrong... you were wrong

2203
02:28:42,184 --> 02:28:44,283
you cannot be right all the time!

2204
02:28:46,156 --> 02:28:47,976
you understand?

2205
02:28:49,326 --> 02:28:50,445

2206
02:28:51,645 --> 02:28:55,846

2207
02:28:57,221 --> 02:28:58,340

2208
02:28:59,632 --> 02:29:02,232
my director had told me....

02:29:03,439 --> 02:29:09,939

2214
02:30:24,032 --> 02:30:28,231
on that day, everyone were hugging each other, getting emotional and making promises

2215
02:30:28,382 --> 02:30:31,884
that we'll stay in touch, we'll surely meet up once in a year!

2216
02:30:32,034 --> 02:30:37,033
who knew that we were seeing Rancho for the last time?

2217
02:31:06,807 --> 02:31:08,626
