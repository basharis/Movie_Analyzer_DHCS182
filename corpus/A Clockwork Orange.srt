1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:02,758
What crime did you commit?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,991
The accidental killing
of a person, sir.

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:07,834
He brutally murdered a woman
in furtherance of theft.

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,638
Fourteen years, sir.

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:11,995
Excellent.

6
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:14,595
He's enterprising...

7
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:15,875
...aggressive...

8
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,235
...outgoing...

9
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,276
...young...

10
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:19,748
...bold...

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,433
...vicious.

12
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:22,909
He'll do.

13
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,229
Fine.

14
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,913
We could still look at C-block.

15
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,116
No, no. That's enough.
He's perfect.

16
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:29,998
I want his records sent to me.

17
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,514
This vicious young hoodlum...

18
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,591
...will be transformed
out of all recognition.

19
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,717
Thank you very much
for this chance.

20
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,633
Let's hope you make
the most of it, my boy.

21
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:41,309
- Shall we go to my office?
- Thank you.

22
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,068
Come in.

23
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,596
Sir!

24
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,637
655321. Sir!

25
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:54,835
Very good, Chief.

26
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,559
Over to the line.
Toes behind it.

27
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,189
Full name and number
to the governor.

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,072
Alexander DeLarge, sir.
655321, sir.

29
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,632
I don't suppose you know who
that was this morning.

30
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,350
That was no less a personage
than the Minister of the Interior.

31
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,477
The new Minister of the Interior.

32
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,518
What they call a very new broom.

33
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,950
These new ridiculous ideas
have come at last.

34
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,395
And orders are orders...

35
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,030
...though I may say to you
in confidence, I do not approve.

36
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,430
An eye for an eye, I say.

37
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,513
If someone hits you,
you hit back, do you not?

38
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,309
Why should not the state,
severely hit by you hooligans...

39
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,278
...not hit back also?

40
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,997
The new view is to say "no."

41
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,471
The new view is that
we turn the bad into good.

42
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,553
All of which seems to me
to be grossly unjust.

43
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,394
Shut your filthy hole, you scum!

44
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,956
You are to be reformed.

45
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,149
Tomorrow you will go
to this man, Brodsky.

46
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,913
You will be leaving here.

47
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:03,233
You will be transferred to
the Ludovico medical facility.

48
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,274
It's believed you'll be able to
leave state custody in a fortnight.

49
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,317
I suppose that prospect
pleases you?

50
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,278
Answer the governor's question!

51
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,794
Yes, sir.
Thank you very much.

52
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,270
I've done my best here,
I really have, sir.

53
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,670
I'm very grateful
to all concerned, sir.

54
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,109
Sign this where it's marked.

55
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,116
Don't read it, sign it!

56
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,915
It says you're willing to have
your sentence commuted...

57
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,993
...to submission to
the Ludovico treatment.

58
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,514
And this.

59
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,913
And another copy.

60
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,712
<i>The next morning I was taken to...</i>

61
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,552
<i>... the Ludovico medical facility...</i>

62
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,552
<i>... outside the town center.</i>

63
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,233
<i>I felt a malenky bit sad...</i>

64
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,311
<i>... having to say goodbye</i>
<i>to the old Staja...</i>

65
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,677
<i>... as you will, when you leave</i>
<i>a place you've gotten used to.</i>

66
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,797
Right, halt the prisoner.

67
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,435
Good morning, sir.
I'm Chief Officer Barnes.

68
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,398
I've got 655321...

69
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,155
...on a transfer from Parkmoor
to the Ludovico Centre, sir.

70
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,948
Good morning.
Yes, we've been expecting you.

71
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,428
I'm Dr. Alcot.

72
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,550
Dr. Alcot.

73
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,119
Very good, sir.

74
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,712
- Are you prepared for the prisoner?
- Yes, of course.

75
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:43,794
I wonder if you'd mind signing
these documents, sir.

76
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,993
There, sir.

77
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,353
And there, sir.

78
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,113
And there.

79
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,759
There you are.

80
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,631
Prison escort, move forward!

81
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,795
Halt!

82
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,438
Excuse me, sir.

83
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,837
Is that the officer who will
take charge of the prisoner?

84
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,356
A word of advice, doc.
You'll have to watch this one.

85
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,990
A right brutal bastard he has been,
and will be again...

86
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,277
...in spite of all his sucking up
and reading the Bible.

87
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,035
We can manage things.
Show the young man to his room.

88
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,919
Right, sir. Come this way, please.

89
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,788
- Morning, Charlie.
- Good morning, Doctor.

90
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,989
Good morning, Alex.

91
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,708
My name is Dr. Branom.
I'm Dr. Brodsky's assistant.

92
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,518
Good morning, missus.
Lovely day.

93
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,954
Indeed, it is.

94
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,713
May I take that?

95
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,629
- How are you feeling?
- Fine, fine.

96
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,713
Good. In a few minutes
you'll meet Dr. Brodsky...

97
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,188
...and begin your treatment.

98
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,188
You're a very lucky boy
to have been chosen.

99
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,474
I realize that,
and I'm very grateful.

100
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,836
We're going to be friends,
aren't we?

101
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,354
I hope so, missus.

102
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,669
What's the hypo for?
Sending me to sleep?

103
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,148
Nothing of the sort.

104
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,194
- Vitamins will it be, then?
- Something like that.

105
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:08,468
You're undernourished, so after
each meal we'll give you a shot.

106
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,119
Roll over on your right side.

107
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:13,079
Loosen your pajama pants
and pull them halfway down.

108
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,512
What exactly is the treatment here
going to be, then?

109
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,312
It's quite simple, really.

110
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,598
We're going to show you some films.

111
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,070
You mean like
going to the pictures?

112
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,078
Something like that.

113
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,116
That's good.

114
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:39,033
I like to viddy
the old films now and again.

115
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,355
<i>And viddy films I would.</i>

116
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,717
<i>Where I was taken to, brothers...</i>

117
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,030
<i>... was like no cine</i>
<i>I ever viddied before.</i>

118
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,476
<i>I was bound up</i>
<i>in a straitjacket...</i>

119
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,836
<i>... and my gulliver was strapped</i>
<i>to a headrest...</i>

120
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,275
<i>... with wires running away from it.</i>

121
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,715
<i>Then they clamped, like,</i>
<i>lid-locks on me eyes...</i>

122
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:01,270
<i>... so that I could not shut them,</i>
<i>no matter how hard I tried.</i>

123
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,192
<i>It seemed a bit crazy to me...</i>

124
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,193
<i>... but I let them get on with</i>
<i>what they wanted to get on with.</i>

125
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:09,671
<i>If I was to be a free malchick</i>
<i>again in a fortnight...</i>

126
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:13,196
<i>... I would put up with much</i>
<i>in the meantime, O my brothers.</i>

127
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,837
<i>The first film was a very good,</i>
<i>professional piece of cine...</i>

128
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,911
<i>... like it was done in Hollywood.</i>

129
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,196
<i>The sounds were real horrorshow.</i>

130
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,477
<i>You could slooshy the screams</i>
<i>and moans very realistic.</i>

131
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,915
<i>You could even get</i>
<i>the breathing and panting...</i>

132
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,993
<i>... of the tolchocking malchicks</i>
<i>at the same time.</i>

133
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,037
<i>And then what do you know?</i>

134
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,316
<i>Soon our dear old friend...</i>

135
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,471
<i>... the red, red vino on tap...</i>

136
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,789
<i>... the same in all places...</i>

137
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,439
<i>... like it's put out</i>
<i>by the same firm...</i>

138
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,513
<i>... began to flow.</i>

139
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,830
<i>It was beautiful.</i>

140
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,395
<i>It's funny how the colors</i>
<i>of the real world...</i>

141
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,552
<i>... only seem really real...</i>

142
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,916
<i>... when you viddy them</i>
<i>on a screen.</i>

143
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,075
<i>Now, all the time</i>
<i>I was watching this...</i>

144
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,470
<i>... I was beginning</i>
<i>to get very aware...</i>

145
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,790
<i>... of, like, not feeling</i>
<i>all that well.</i>

146
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:28,749
<i>And this I put down</i>
<i>to all the rich food and vitamins.</i>

147
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,152
<i>But I tried to forget this,</i>
<i>concentrating on the next film...</i>

148
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,960
<i>... which jumped right away</i>
<i>on a young devotchka...</i>

149
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,919
<i>... who was being given</i>
<i>the old in-out, in-out...</i>

150
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,796
<i>... first by one malchick...</i>

151
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,709
<i>... then another.</i>

152
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,193
<i>Then another.</i>

153
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,349
<i>When it came to</i>
<i>the 6th or 7th malchick...</i>

154
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,956
<i>... leering and smecking</i>
<i>and then going into it...</i>

155
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,272
<i>... I began to feel really sick.</i>

156
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,268
<i>But I could not shut me glazzies.</i>

157
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:04,796
<i>And even if I tried to move</i>
<i>my glazzballs about...</i>

158
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,951
<i>... I still could not get out of...</i>

159
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,760
<i>... the line of fire</i>
<i>of this picture.</i>

160
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,913
Get me up.

161
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,998
I'm going to be sick.

162
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,916
Get something for me to be sick in!

163
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,759
Very soon now,
the drug will cause the subject...

164
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,150
...to experience
a deathlike paralysis...

165
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:32,075
...together with deep feelings
of terror and helplessness.

166
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:36,595
One of our early test subjects
described it as being like death.

167
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,638
A sense of stifling or drowning.

168
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,920
And it is during this period,
we have found...

169
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:46,630
...the subject will make
his most rewarding associations...

170
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,475
...between his catastrophic
experience, environment...

171
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,314
...and the violence he sees.

172
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,277
Dr. Brodsky is pleased with you.

173
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,795
You've made
a very positive response.

174
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,589
Tomorrow there will be two
sessions, morning and afternoon.

175
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,718
You mean I have to viddy
two sessions in one day?

176
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:10,997
I imagine you'll feel a bit
limp by the end of the day.

177
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:14,437
But we have to be hard on you.
You have to be cured.

178
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,669
It was horrible.

179
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,433
Of course it was horrible.

180
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,989
Violence is a very horrible thing.

181
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,878
That's what you're learning now.

182
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,314
Your body's learning it.

183
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,559
I just don't understand about
feeling sick the way I did.

184
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,917
I never used to feel sick.
I used to feel the very opposite.

185
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,958
Doing it or watching it,
I used to feel real horrorshow.

186
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:37,150
You felt ill this afternoon
because you're getting better.

187
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,437
When we're healthy,
we respond to the hateful...

188
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,591
...with fear and nausea.

189
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,910
You're becoming healthy,
that's all.

190
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:48,118
By this time tomorrow,
you'll be healthier still.

191
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,596
<i>It was the next day, brothers...</i>

192
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,319
<i>... and I had truly done my best...</i>

193
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,915
<i>... morning and afternoon</i>
<i>to play it their way...</i>

194
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,799
<i>... and sit like a horrorshow</i>
<i>cooperative malchick...</i>

195
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,473
<i>... in the chair of torture...</i>

196
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:53,793
<i>... while they flashed nasty bits</i>
<i>of ultra-violence on the screen...</i>

197
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,518
<i>... though not on the soundtrack,</i>
<i>the only sound being music.</i>

198
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,948
<i>Then I noticed,</i>
<i>in all my pain and sickness...</i>

199
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,954
<i>... what music it was</i>
<i>that, like, cracked and boomed.</i>

200
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:09,229
<i>It was Ludwig van.</i>

201
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,194
<i>Ninth Symphony, fourth movement.</i>

202
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:30,152
Stop it! Stop it!
Please, I beg you!

203
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,834
It's a sin!

204
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,713
It's a sin!

205
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,035
Sin?

206
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,793
What's all this about sin?

207
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,110
That!

208
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,194
Using Ludwig van like that.
He did no harm to anyone.

209
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,749
Beethoven just wrote music.

210
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,437
Are you referring
to the background score?

211
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,791
You've heard Beethoven before?

212
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,717
So you're keen on music?

213
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,552
Can't be helped.

214
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,993
Here's the punishment
element perhaps.

215
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,996
The governor ought to be pleased.

216
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,471
I'm sorry, Alex.

217
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,432
This is for your own good.

218
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,955
You'll have to bear with us
for a while.

219
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:27,269
But it's not fair.
It's not fair I should feel ill...

220
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,313
...when I hear lovely,
lovely Ludwig van.

221
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,070
You must take your chance, boy.

222
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,909
The choice has been all yours.

223
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,999
You needn't take it
any further, sir.

224
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,118
You've proved to me all this
ultra-violence and killing...

225
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,477
...is wrong, wrong
and terribly wrong!

226
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,552
I've learned me lesson, sir.

227
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,598
I see now what I've
never seen before.

228
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:54,673
I'm cured. Praise God!

229
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,269
You're not cured yet, boy.

230
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,473
But, sirs.

231
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,039
Missus!

232
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,396
I see that it's wrong!

233
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:07,519
It's wrong because
it's, like, against society.

234
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,320
Because everybody has the
right to live and be happy...

235
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,233
...without being
tolchocked and knifed!

236
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,438
No, no, boy.
You really must leave it to us.

237
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,272
But be cheerful about it.

238
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:21,671
In less than a fortnight now,
you'll be a free man.

239
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,669
Ladies and gentlemen...

240
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,673
...at this stage, we introduce
the subject himself.

241
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,753
He is, as you will perceive,
fit and well-nourished.

242
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,719
He comes straight from a night's
sleep and a good breakfast...

243
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,915
...undrugged...

244
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,912
...unhypnotized.

245
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,675
Tomorrow we send him out with
confidence into the world again...

246
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,390
...as decent a lad as you
would meet on a May morning.

247
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,839
What a change is here,
ladies and gentlemen.

248
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,355
From the hoodlum
the state committed...

249
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:28,233
...to unprofitable punishment
two years ago.

250
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,113
Unchanged after two years.

251
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,956
Unchanged, do I say?

252
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,553
Not quite.

253
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:40,351
Prison taught him the false smile,
the rubbed hands of hypocrisy.

254
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,751
The fawning, greased,
obsequious leer.

255
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,037
Other vices it taught him...

256
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:49,989
...as well as confirming him in
those he had long practiced before.

257
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:54,072
Our party promised
to restore law and order...

258
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,199
...and to make the streets safe for
the ordinary peace-loving citizen.

259
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:02,319
This pledge is now
about to become a reality.

260
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:06,109
Ladies and gentlemen,
today is an historic moment.

261
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:10,672
The problem of criminal violence
is soon to be a thing of the past.

262
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,471
But enough of words.

263
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,870
Actions speak louder than.

264
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,712
Action now.

265
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,077
Observe all.

266
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,754
Our necks are out
a long way on this, Minister.

267
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,036
I have complete faith in Brodsky.

268
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:37,317
If the polls are right,
we have nothing to lose.

269
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,310
Hello, heap of dirt.

270
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,118
You don't wash much, do you,
judging by the horrible smell.

271
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,995
Why do you say that?
I had a shower this morning.

272
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,754
He had a shower this morning.

273
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,231
You trying to call me a liar?

274
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,276
No, brother.

275
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,598
You must think I'm awfully stupid.

276
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,758
Why did you do that, brother?

277
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,877
I've never done wrong to you.

278
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,111
You want to know why I did that?

279
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,509
Well, you see...

280
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,954
...I do this...

281
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,349
...and that...

282
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,672
...and this because I don't like
your horrible type, do I?

283
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,150
And if you want
to start something...

284
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,789
...you just go ahead.
Go on!

285
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,189
Please do!

286
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,512
I'm going to be sick.

287
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,912
You're going to be sick, are you?

288
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,435
I'm going to be sick.
Please let me get up.

289
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,673
You want to get up?

290
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,718
Well, now you listen to me.

291
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,913
If you want to get up...

292
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,277
...you've got to
do something for me.

293
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,075
Here.

294
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,629
Here.

295
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,912
You see that?

296
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,279
You see that shoe?

297
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,959
I want you to lick it.

298
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,428
Go on!

299
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,873
Lick it!

300
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,070
<i>And, O my brothers,</i>
<i>would you believe...</i>

301
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,471
<i>... your faithful friend</i>
<i>and long-suffering narrator...</i>

302
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:16,029
<i>... pushed out his red yabzick</i>
<i>a mile and a half...</i>

303
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,999
<i>... to lick the grahzny,</i>
<i>vonny boots.</i>

304
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,715
And again!

305
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,315
<i>The horrible killing sickness</i>
<i>had whooshed up...</i>

306
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,118
<i>... and turned the joy of battle...</i>

307
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,394
<i>... into a feeling</i>
<i>I was going to snuff it.</i>

308
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,868
And again.

309
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,271
Nice and clean.

310
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,915
Thank you very much.

311
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,912
That will do very well.

312
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,155
Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen.

313
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,358
<i>She came towards me...</i>

314
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,195
<i>... with the light, like it was the</i>
<i>light light of heavenly grace.</i>

315
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,556
<i>And the thing that flashed</i>
<i>in me gulliver...</i>

316
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,314
<i>... was that I'd like to have her</i>
<i>there on the floor...</i>

317
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:05,632
<i>... with the old in-out,</i>
<i>real savage.</i>

318
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,355
<i>But quick as a shot</i>
<i>came the sickness.</i>

319
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,034
<i>Like a detective who 'd been</i>
<i>watching around the corner...</i>

320
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,439
<i>... and now followed</i>
<i>to make his arrest.</i>

321
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:42,830
Enough!

322
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,718
Thank you very much.

323
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,632
Thank you, my dear.

324
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,160
Not feeling too bad now, are you?

325
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,710
No, sir.
I feel really great, sir.

326
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,791
- Good.
- Was it all right, sir?

327
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:15,836
Did I do well?

328
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,277
Fine, my boy.
Absolutely fine.

329
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,714
You see, ladies and gentlemen...

330
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,315
...our subject is impelled
towards the good...

331
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:27,075
...by paradoxically
being impelled towards evil.

332
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,958
The intention to act violently...

333
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,431
...is accompanied by strong
feelings of physical distress.

334
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:35,274
To counter these,
the subject has to switch...

335
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,353
...to a diametrically
opposed attitude.

336
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,319
Any questions?

337
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,913
Choice!

338
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:48,596
The boy has no real choice, has he?

339
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,319
Self-interest.

340
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,357
The fear of physical pain...

341
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:56,957
...drove him to that
grotesque act of self-abasement.

342
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,631
Its insincerity
was clearly to be seen.

343
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,677
He ceases to be a wrongdoer.

344
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:06,311
He ceases also to be
a creature capable of moral choice.

345
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,790
Padre, these are subtleties.

346
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:12,032
We're not concerned with motives,
with the higher ethics.

347
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:15,795
We are concerned only
with cutting down crime.

348
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:22,431
And with relieving the ghastly
congestion in our prisons.

349
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,355
He will be your true Christian...

350
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,591
...ready to turn the other cheek.

351
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,718
Ready to be crucified,
rather than crucify.

352
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,919
Sick to the very heart at the
thought even of killing a fly.

353
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,434
Reclamation.

354
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,830
Joy before the angels of God.

355
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:42,072
The point is that it works!

356
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:49,477
<i>And the very next day,</i>
<i>your friend and humble narrator...</i>

357
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,676
<i>... was a free man.</i>

358
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,873
Son!

359
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,595
Hi, hi, hi there, my Pee and Em.

360
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,074
Mum.

361
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,070
How are you, love?
Nice to see you.

362
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,910
- Dad.
- Lad. What a surprise.

363
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,151
- Good to see you.
- Keeping fit?

364
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,074
How are you, then?

365
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,356
I'm fine, fine.

366
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,477
Keeping out of trouble, you know.

367
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,758
I'm back!

368
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,355
Good to see you.

369
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,592
Why didn't you let us know
what was happening?

370
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,952
I wanted it to be, like,
a big surprise for you and Pee.

371
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,993
It's a surprise, all right.
A bit bewildering too.

372
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,959
We've only just read about it
in morning papers.

373
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,918
You should have let us know, lad.

374
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:19,314
Not that we're not very pleased
to see you again, and all...

375
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,993
...cured too, eh?

376
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,231
That's right.
They did a great job on me.

377
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,994
I'm completely reformed.

378
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,198
Still the same old place, then?

379
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,919
There's a strange fellow
sitting on the sofa...

380
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:49,152
...munchy-wunching
lomticks of toast.

381
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,712
That's Joe.

382
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,437
He lives here now.

383
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,994
The lodger.

384
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,753
That's what he is.

385
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,071
He rents your room.

386
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,719
How do you do, Joe?

387
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,916
Find the room comfortable, do you?

388
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,037
No complaints?

389
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,752
I've heard about you.

390
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,472
I know what you've done.

391
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,155
Breaking the hearts of your
poor, grieving parents.

392
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,792
So you're back, eh?

393
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:41,477
Back to make life a misery for
your lovely parents once more?

394
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,193
Over my dead corpse, you will.

395
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,591
Because, you see, they've let me
be more like a son to them...

396
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,717
...than like a lodger.

397
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,714
Don't go fighting here, boys.

398
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,112
Do put your hand
over your mouth, please.

399
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,549
It's bloody revolting.

400
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,393
Are you all right?

401
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,112
It's the treatment.

402
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,874
It's disgusting.
Enough to put you off your food.

403
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:17,749
Leave him be, Joe.
It's the treatment.

404
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,433
Do you think we ought
to do something?

405
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:26,677
Would you like me to make you
a nice cup of tea, son?

406
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,958
What have you done
with all me own personal things?

407
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,719
That was all...

408
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,552
...took away, son.

409
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,838
By the police.

410
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,071
New regulation, see...

411
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:56,232
...about compensation
for the victims.

412
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,398
What about Basil?

413
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,952
Where is my snake?

414
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,949
He met with...

415
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,918
...like, an accident.

416
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,119
He passed away.

417
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,276
What's going to happen to me, then?

418
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,589
I mean...

419
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,079
...that's my room he's in.

420
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,117
There's no denying that.

421
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,588
This is my home also.

422
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,750
What suggestions have you,
my Pee and Em, to make?

423
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,908
All this needs thinking about, son.

424
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,839
We can't very well
just kick Joe out.

425
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,832
Not just like that, can we?

426
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,069
I mean...

427
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,197
...Joe's here doing a job.

428
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,635
A contract it is.
Two years.

429
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,429
We made, like, an arrangement.
Didn't we, Joe?

430
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,997
You see, son...

431
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:18,670
...Joe's paid next month's
rent already...

432
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,879
...so whatever we may do in
the future, we can't just say...

433
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,998
...to Joe to get out, now can we?

434
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,197
No, but it's much more than that.

435
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,349
I mean, I've got you two
to think of...

436
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,353
...who've been like
a father and mother to me.

437
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:37,433
It wouldn't be right for me
to go off and leave you two...

438
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:40,478
...to the tender mercies
of this young monster...

439
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,837
...who's been like
no real son at all.

440
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,670
Look, he's weeping now.

441
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:49,753
But that's all his craft
and artfulness.

442
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,719
Let him go and find
a room somewhere else.

443
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:57,078
Let him learn the errors
of his way, and that a bad boy...

444
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:00,630
...doesn't deserve such a good
mum and dad as he's had.

445
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,348
All right.

446
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,197
I know how things are now.

447
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,114
I've suffered and I've suffered...

448
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,237
...and I've suffered.

449
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,992
And everybody wants me
to go on suffering.

450
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,950
You've made others suffer.

451
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:27,432
It's only right
that you should suffer proper.

452
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,952
I've been told
everything you've done...

453
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,077
...sitting around the family table.

454
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,278
And pretty shocking
it was to listen to.

455
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:39,197
It made me real sick,
a lot of it did.

456
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:44,516
Now look what you've gone
and done to your mother.

457
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,318
Come on. It's all right now.

458
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,835
Right!

459
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,198
I'm leaving now.

460
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,476
You won't ever viddy me no more.

461
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,358
I'll make me own way.

462
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:10,315
Thank you very much. Let it lie
heavy on your consciences.

463
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,433
Now don't take it like that, son.

464
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,993
Can you spare some cutter,
me brother?

465
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,712
Can you spare some cutter,
me brother?

466
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:28,198
Can you spare some cutter,
me brother?

467
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,039
Thanks, brother.

468
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,992
Jamey Mack!

469
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,839
May the hokey fly!

470
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:14,550
Mother of God and all the blessed
saints in heaven preserve us!

471
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,191
I never forget a face, me God!

472
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,714
I never forget any face.

473
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:22,633
Leave me alone, brother.
I've never seen you before!

474
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:26,190
This is the poisonous young swine
that near done me in.

475
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,555
Him and his friends.

476
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:30,553
They beat me and kicked me
and punched me.

477
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,279
Stop him! Stop him!

478
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:36,274
They laughed at me blood
and me moans, this murderous dog!

479
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:39,751
<i>Then there was like</i>
<i>a sea of dirty, smelly old men...</i>

480
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,991
<i>... trying to get at</i>
<i>your humble narrator...</i>

481
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,755
<i>... with their feeble rookers</i>
<i>and horny old claws.</i>

482
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,673
<i>It was old age</i>
<i>having a go at youth.</i>

483
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:52,477
<i>And I daren 't do a single</i>
<i>solitary thing, O my brothers.</i>

484
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,671
<i>It being better</i>
<i>to be hit at like that...</i>

485
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:57,388
<i>... than want to sick</i>
<i>and feel that horrible pain.</i>

486
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,993
All right, all right!

487
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,070
Stop it now!

488
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:03,551
Come on. Stop breaking the
state's peace, you naughty boys!

489
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,519
Back away! Go away with you!

490
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,955
What's your trouble, sir?

491
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,599
Well!

492
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,595
Well, well, well!

493
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,749
If it isn't little Alex.

494
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,319
Long time no viddy, droog.

495
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,959
How goes?

496
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,394
It's impossible.

497
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,789
I don't believe it.

498
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,837
Evidence of the old glazzies.

499
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,798
Nothing up our sleeves.

500
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,996
No magic, little Alex.

501
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:42,550
A job for two
who are now of job age.

502
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,273
The police.

503
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,509
Come on, Alex.

504
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,239
Come for walking.

505
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,669
Come, come, come,
my little droogies.

506
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,399
I just don't get this at all.

507
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:19,710
The old days are dead and gone.

508
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:22,679
For what I did in the past,
I've been punished.

509
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,552
I've been cured.

510
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,949
That was read out to us.

511
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,952
The inspector read it
all out to us.

512
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,760
He said it was a very good way.

513
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,194
But what is all this?

514
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,869
It was them
that went for me, brothers.

515
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,680
You're not on their side,
and can't be.

516
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:40,310
You can't be, Dim.

517
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,120
It was someone we fillied with
back in the old days...

518
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:46,670
...trying to get his own revenge
after all this time. Remember?

519
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,273
A long time is right.

520
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,670
I don't remember them days
too horrorshow.

521
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,911
And don't call me Dim
no more, either.

522
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:55,151
Officer, call me.

523
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:58,790
Enough is remembered, though,
little Alex.

524
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:02,358
And this is to make sure
you stay cured.

525
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,069
That's enough.

526
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,834
A bit more. He's still kicking.

527
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,672
Cured, are you?

528
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,955
Be viddying you some more
sometime, droogie.

529
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:43,434
<i>Where was I to go,</i>
<i>who had no home and no money?</i>

530
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,796
<i>I cried for meself.</i>

531
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,793
<i>Home, home, home.</i>

532
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,837
<i>It was home I was wanting.</i>

533
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:53,958
<i>And it was home</i>
<i>I came to, brothers...</i>

534
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:56,714
<i>... not realizing,</i>
<i>in the state I was in...</i>

535
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,838
<i>... where I was</i>
<i>and had been before.</i>

536
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,991
Who on earth could that be?

537
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,512
I'll see who it is.

538
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,113
Yes, what is it?

539
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,589
Please...

540
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:45,957
Frank, I think this young man
needs some help.

541
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,833
My God!

542
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,910
What's happened to you, my boy?

543
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,795
<i>And would you believe it,</i>
<i>O my brothers and only friends...</i>

544
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,190
<i>... there was your</i>
<i>faithful narrator...</i>

545
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,795
<i>... being held helpless</i>
<i>like a babe in arms...</i>

546
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,315
<i>... and suddenly realizing</i>
<i>where he was...</i>

547
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:11,836
<i>... and why "home" on the gate</i>
<i>had looked so familiar.</i>

548
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,752
<i>But I knew I was safe.</i>

549
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,956
<i>I knew he would not remember me.</i>

550
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,872
<i>For in those carefree days...</i>

551
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,917
<i>... I and my so-called droogs...</i>

552
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:23,516
<i>... wore our maskies, which were</i>
<i>like real horrorshow disguises.</i>

553
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:25,909
Police.

554
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,510
Ghastly, horrible police...

555
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,953
...they beat me up, sir.

556
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:41,355
The police beat me up.

557
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,952
I know you!

558
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,036
Isn't it your picture
in the newspapers?

559
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,396
Didn't I see you
on the video this morning?

560
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:56,837
Are you not the poor victim
of this horrible new technique?

561
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,314
Yes, sir.

562
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:01,832
That's exactly who I am and
what I am, sir. A victim.

563
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:05,072
Then, by God, you've been
sent here by providence!

564
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:08,278
Tortured in prison, then
tortured by the police.

565
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:12,832
My heart goes out to you.
You're not the first to come here.

566
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:15,833
The police like to bring
their victims to this village.

567
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,399
But it's providential that you...

568
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:21,030
...who are also another kind
of victim, should come here.

569
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,832
But you're cold and shivering.

570
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,639
Julian...

571
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:30,030
...draw a bath for this young man.

572
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,554
Certainly, Frank.

573
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,478
Thank you very much.

574
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:35,278
God bless you.

575
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:30,155
He can be the most potent
weapon imaginable...

576
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:33,437
...to ensure the government
is not returned in the election.

577
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,398
The government's big boast, sir...

578
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:38,234
...is the way they have
dealt with crime:

579
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,232
Recruiting young roughs
into the police...

580
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:43,392
...proposing will-sapping
techniques of conditioning.

581
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,790
We've seen it before
in other countries.

582
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,439
The thin end of the wedge.

583
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:51,593
Before we know it, we'll have the
full apparatus of totalitarianism.

584
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:59,678
This young boy is a living witness
to these diabolical proposals.

585
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:03,515
The people, the common people,
must know, must see.

586
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:07,958
There are traditions of liberty to
defend. That tradition is all.

587
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:10,077
The common people
will let it go, yes.

588
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,356
They'll sell liberty
for a quieter life.

589
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,079
That is why they must be led.

590
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,311
Driven. Pushed.

591
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:22,354
Fine.

592
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,952
Thank you very much, sir.

593
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,399
He'll be here.

594
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:34,631
<i>I'm singing in the rain</i>

595
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:38,233
<i>Just singing in the rain</i>

596
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:42,077
<i>What a glorious feeling</i>

597
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:45,637
<i>I'm hap-hap-happy again</i>

598
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:49,232
<i>I'm laughing at clouds</i>

599
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,434
<i>So dark up above</i>

600
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,755
<i>The sun 's in my heart</i>

601
00:42:56,560 --> 00:43:00,348
<i>I'm ready for love</i>

602
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:03,879
<i>Let the stormy clouds chase</i>

603
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:07,199
<i>Everyone from the place</i>

604
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:13,390
<i>Come on with the rain</i>
<i>I've a smile on my face</i>

605
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,878
<i>I'll walk down the lane</i>

606
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,079
Good evening, sir.

607
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,359
Good evening.

608
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,599
It was very kind of you
to leave this out for me.

609
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:02,149
There was no one around,
so I started.

610
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,152
Hope that's all right, sir.

611
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,158
Of course.

612
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:41,035
Food all right?

613
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:48,158
Great, sir. Great.

614
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,150
Try the wine.

615
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:00,508
Thank you, sir.

616
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:04,274
Cheers.

617
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:07,389
Happy days.

618
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:19,675
Won't you join me?

619
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,516
My health doesn't allow it.

620
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:24,594
No, thank you.

621
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:32,675
"1960, Château...

622
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,031
...Saint-Estèphe.

623
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:36,076
Médoc."

624
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:37,230
Very good brand.

625
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:46,555
Very good...

626
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:47,994
...color, sir.

627
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:53,678
Smells nice too.

628
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,956
Very nice little number.

629
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:12,394
Here's to it.

630
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:23,194
Very refreshing, sir.
Very refreshing.

631
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:26,238
I'm pleased you
appreciate good wine.

632
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:29,117
Have another glass.

633
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:43,039
My wife...

634
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:47,796
...used to do everything for me
and leave me to my writing.

635
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:52,192
Your wife? Is she away?

636
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,790
She's dead!

637
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:00,512
I'm sorry to hear about that.

638
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:03,035
She was very badly raped, you see.

639
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:05,589
We were assaulted by
vicious young hoodlums...

640
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:08,070
...in this very room
you're sitting in now.

641
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:12,871
I was left a helpless cripple,
but for her the agony was too great.

642
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:14,952
The doctors said
it was pneumonia...

643
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:17,919
...because it happened later,
during a flu epidemic.

644
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:22,233
The doctors told me it was
pneumonia, but I knew what it was.

645
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:26,632
A victim of the modern age.
Poor, poor girl!

646
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:31,993
And now you.

647
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:35,472
Another victim of the modern age.

648
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:37,637
But you can be helped.

649
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:41,910
I phoned some friends while
you were having your bath.

650
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:42,956
Some...

651
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:44,235
...friends?

652
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:45,959
They want to help you.

653
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:48,350
- Help me?
- Help you.

654
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:51,956
- Who are they?
- Very, very important people.

655
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:54,475
And they're interested in you.

656
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:01,790
This'll be these people now.

657
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:05,316
I don't want to trouble you
any further. I should be leaving.

658
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:08,237
No trouble at all.

659
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:10,069
Here.

660
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:12,151
Let me fill your glass.

661
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:38,472
So this is the young man.

662
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:41,199
How do you do, sir?

663
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:44,074
Missus.
I'm very pleased to meet you.

664
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:46,829
I hope you forgive us for coming
at this hour...

665
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:48,877
...but we heard you
were in trouble...

666
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:51,270
...and so we came over to see
if we could help.

667
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:53,670
Very kind of you, sir.
Thank you very much.

668
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:56,070
I understand you had a rather...

669
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:57,514
...unfortunate...

670
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:59,193
...encounter...

671
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:01,112
...with the police tonight.

672
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:03,351
Yes, I suppose
you could call it that.

673
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:04,874
How are you feeling now?

674
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:06,314
Much better, thank you.

675
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:08,835
Feel like talking,
answering a few questions?

676
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:10,354
Fine, sir. Fine.

677
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:13,720
As I said, we've heard about you.

678
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:16,714
We are interested in your case.

679
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:19,713
- We want to help you.
- Thank you very much.

680
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,992
Shall we get down to it?

681
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:24,958
Fine. Fine, sir.

682
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:32,679
The newspapers mentioned...

683
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:37,038
...in addition to being conditioned
against acts of sex and violence...

684
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:40,511
...you've inadvertently been
conditioned against music.

685
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:44,398
I think that was something
that they didn't plan for.

686
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:46,551
You see, missus...

687
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:50,156
...I'm very fond of music.
Especially Beethoven.

688
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:53,117
Ludwig van Beethoven.

689
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:55,555
- B-E...
- It's all right, thank you.

690
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:59,993
And it just so happened that
while they were showing me...

691
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:03,994
...a particularly bad film
of, like, a concentration camp...

692
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:07,630
...the background music
was playing Beethoven.

693
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:10,519
So now you have
the same reaction to music...

694
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:12,432
...as you do to sex and violence?

695
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:16,798
No, missus. You see, it's not
all music. It's just the Ninth.

696
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:18,712
You mean Beethoven's Ninth Symphony?

697
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:21,872
That's right. I can't listen
to the Ninth anymore at all.

698
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:25,430
When I hear the Ninth, I get, like...

699
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:27,238
...this funny feeling.

700
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:32,358
And then all I can think about
is, like, trying to snuff it.

701
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:36,832
- I beg your pardon?
- Snuff it. Death, I mean.

702
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:39,548
I just want to die peacefully...

703
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,230
...like, with no pain.

704
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:44,757
Do you feel that way now?

705
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:47,757
No, sir, not exactly.

706
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,194
I still feel...

707
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:50,634
...very miserable.

708
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:53,314
Very much down in spirits.

709
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:55,074
Do you still feel...

710
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:56,753
...suicidal?

711
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:01,552
Put it this way:

712
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:04,559
I feel very low in myself.

713
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:07,590
I can't see much in the future.

714
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:12,118
I feel that any second, something
terrible is going to happen to me.

715
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,392
Well done, Frank.

716
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:33,918
Get the car, would you, please?

717
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:54,999
<i>I woke up...</i>

718
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:03,915
<i>... the pain and sickness</i>
<i>all over me like an animal.</i>

719
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:14,359
<i>Then I realized what it was.</i>

720
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:18,273
<i>The music coming up</i>
<i>from the floor...</i>

721
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:21,557
<i>... was our old friend,</i>
<i>Ludwig van...</i>

722
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:24,360
<i>... and the dreaded Ninth Symphony.</i>

723
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:33,279
Let me out!

724
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:35,192
Open the door!

725
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:37,950
Come on, open the door!

726
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:41,628
Turn it off!

727
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:43,552
Turn it off!

728
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:51,076
Stop it!

729
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:38,839
Turn it off!

730
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:41,110
Please!

731
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:43,430
Turn it off!

732
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:59,553
<i>Suddenly, I viddied</i>
<i>what I had to do...</i>

733
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:02,030
<i>... and what I had wanted to do.</i>

734
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:04,749
<i>And that was to do myself in.</i>

735
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:06,479
<i>To snuff it.</i>

736
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:10,031
<i>To blast off forever,</i>
<i>out of this wicked, cruel world.</i>

737
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:13,869
<i>One moment of pain, perhaps...</i>

738
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:15,878
<i>... and then sleep.</i>

739
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:18,509
<i>Forever and ever...</i>

740
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:20,034
<i>... and ever.</i>

741
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:45,198
<i>I jumped, O my brothers...</i>

742
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:46,839
<i>... and I fell hard.</i>

743
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:49,275
<i>But I did not snuff it.</i>

744
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:51,393
<i>If I had snuffed it...</i>

745
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:54,791
<i>... I would not be here</i>
<i>to tell what I told have.</i>

746
00:54:56,640 --> 00:55:01,077
<i>I came back to life</i>
<i>after a long, black, black gap...</i>

747
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:04,471
<i>... of what might have been</i>
<i>a million years.</i>

748
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:34,474
He's recovered
consciousness, Doctor.

749
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:14,353
Hello, lad.

750
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:16,113
Hello, son.

751
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,439
How are you?

752
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:21,431
You feeling better?

753
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:26,709
What...

754
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:27,949
...gives...

755
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:31,271
...O my Pee and Em?

756
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:33,719
What makes...

757
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:35,356
...you think...

758
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:37,955
...you are welcome?

759
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:42,637
There, there, Mother.
It's all right.

760
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:44,438
He doesn't mean it.

761
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:49,234
You were in the papers again, son.

762
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,479
It said...

763
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:54,359
...they had done
great wrong to you.

764
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:56,474
It said...

765
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:57,994
...how the government...

766
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:00,151
...drove you to try...

767
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:01,913
...and do yourself in.

768
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:05,835
And when you think about it, son...

769
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:09,394
...maybe it was our fault too...

770
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:10,954
...in a way.

771
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:13,871
Your home's your home...

772
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:16,589
...when all's said and done, son.

773
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:28,589
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Doctor.

774
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:39,350
- How are you feeling today?
- Fine.

775
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:40,669
Good. May I?

776
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:43,036
- I'm Dr. Taylor.
- Haven't seen you before.

777
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:44,508
I'm your psychiatrist.

778
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:46,557
Psychiatrist!
Do I need one?

779
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:48,233
Just part of hospital routine.

780
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:50,510
Are we going to
talk about me sex life?

781
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:54,071
I'm going to show you
some slides...

782
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:57,039
...and you're going to tell me
what you think about them.

783
00:57:57,920 --> 00:57:58,750
Jolly good.

784
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:02,313
You know anything about dreams?

785
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:03,789
Something, yes.

786
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:05,712
- You know what they mean?
- Perhaps.

787
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:07,319
You concerned about something?

788
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:10,438
No, not concerned, really...

789
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:12,591
...but I've been having
this nasty dream.

790
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:14,239
Very nasty.

791
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:16,311
It's like...

792
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:20,310
...when I was all smashed up,
you know...

793
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:22,516
...and half-awake
and unconscious-like...

794
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:24,796
...I kept having this dream.

795
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:27,793
All these doctors were
playing around with me gulliver.

796
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:30,031
You know, like the inside
of me brain.

797
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:33,033
I seem to have this dream
over and over again.

798
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:35,316
Do you think it means anything?

799
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:40,432
Patients with injuries like yours
often have dreams of this sort.

800
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:42,671
It's all part
of the recovery process.

801
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:46,553
Now then, each of these slides
needs a reply...

802
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:48,711
...from one of the people
in the picture.

803
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:52,032
You tell me what you think
the person would say...

804
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:53,110
...all right?

805
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:54,713
Righty-right.

806
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:58,915
"Isn't the plumage beautiful?"

807
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:02,475
I just say what the
other person would say?

808
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:07,959
Don't think about it too long.

809
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:10,589
Say the first thing
that pops into your mind.

810
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:15,435
Cabbages. Knickers.

811
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:18,755
It's not got a beak.

812
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,228
Good.

813
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:27,514
"The boy you always quarreled with
is seriously ill."

814
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:30,112
My mind is a blank...

815
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:34,874
...and I'll smash your face
for you, yarblockos.

816
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:36,075
Good.

817
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:40,551
"What do you want?"

818
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:44,871
No time for the old in-out, love.
I've just come to read the meter.

819
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:46,559
Good.

820
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:53,236
"You sold me a crummy watch.
I want my money back."

821
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:56,792
You know what you can do with
that watch? Stick it up your ass!

822
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,594
"You can do whatever
you like with these."

823
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:06,792
Eggiwegs.

824
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:09,197
I would like...

825
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:10,668
...to smash them.

826
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:12,674
And pick them all up...

827
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:14,478
...and throw...

828
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:16,119
Fucking hell!

829
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:19,190
There. That's all there is to it.

830
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:21,273
Are you all right?

831
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:23,394
Hope so.

832
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:26,552
Is that the end, then?
I was quite enjoying that.

833
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:28,108
Good. I'm glad.

834
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:29,469
How many did I get right?

835
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:31,438
It's not that kind of a test.

836
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:34,877
But you seem well on the way
to making a complete recovery.

837
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:36,833
When do I get out, then?

838
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:39,548
I'm sure it won't be long now.

839
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:42,433
<i>So I waited...</i>

840
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:44,113
<i>... and, O my brothers...</i>

841
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:45,833
<i>... I got a lot better...</i>

842
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:49,197
<i>... munching away at eggiwegs</i>
<i>and lomticks of toast...</i>

843
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:51,749
<i>... and lovely steakie-wakes.</i>

844
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,399
<i>And then one day...</i>

845
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:57,633
<i>... they said I was going to have</i>
<i>a very special visitor.</i>

846
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:05,434
Just wait outside for a moment,
would you, Officer?

847
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:10,470
I'm afraid my change of schedule
has thrown you.

848
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:12,870
The patient's in the middle
of supper.

849
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:15,839
That's quite all right, Minister.
No trouble at all.

850
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:20,118
- Good evening, my boy.
- Hi there, my little droogies.

851
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:22,078
How are you getting on, young man?

852
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:24,556
Great, sir. Just great.

853
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:26,799
Can I do anything more for you?

854
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:28,712
I don't think so, Sir Leslie.

855
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:31,520
Then I leave you to it.
Nurse!

856
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:37,357
You seem to have a whole ward
to yourself, my boy.

857
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:38,828
Yes, sir.

858
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:41,590
And a very lonely place
it is too...

859
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:44,115
...when I wake up in the night
with me pain.

860
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:47,670
Anyway, good to see you
on the mend.

861
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:50,388
I kept in touch
with the hospital, of course.

862
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:52,392
And now I've come down
personally...

863
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:54,153
...to see how you're getting along.

864
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:56,750
I've suffered the tortures
of the damned.

865
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,433
Tortures of the damned.

866
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:01,638
Yes, I can appreciate that
you've had an extremely...

867
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:04,474
Oh, look. Let me help you
with that, shall I?

868
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:10,673
I can tell you that I, and the
government of which I'm a member...

869
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:14,674
...are deeply sorry about this,
my boy. Deeply sorry.

870
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:16,114
We tried to help you.

871
01:02:16,360 --> 01:02:20,273
We followed recommendations
that turned out to be wrong.

872
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:24,349
An inquiry will place the
responsibility where it belongs.

873
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:28,072
We want you to regard us
as friends.

874
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:29,469
We put you right.

875
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:31,717
You're getting
the best of treatment.

876
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:34,110
We never wished you harm.

877
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:36,960
But there are some who did, and do.

878
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:40,000
And I think you know who those are.

879
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:44,189
There are certain people who wanted
to use you for political ends.

880
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:46,670
They would have been
glad to have you dead...

881
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:49,957
...for they thought they could then
blame it on the government.

882
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:52,750
There is also a certain man...

883
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,389
...a writer of subversive
literature...

884
01:02:55,640 --> 01:02:57,631
...who has been howling
for your blood.

885
01:02:57,880 --> 01:03:01,156
He's been mad with desire
to stick a knife into you.

886
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:03,039
But you're safe from him now.

887
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:05,236
We put him away.

888
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:10,038
He found out that you
had done wrong to him.

889
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:12,915
At least he believed
you had done wrong.

890
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:17,199
He formed this idea in his head
that you had been responsible...

891
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:20,716
...for the death of someone
near and dear to him.

892
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:22,595
He was a menace.

893
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:24,876
We put him away
for his own protection.

894
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:26,354
And also for yours.

895
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:28,439
Where is he now?

896
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:31,990
We put him away
where he can do you no harm.

897
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:35,198
You see, we are looking
after your interests.

898
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:37,431
We are interested in you.

899
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:41,032
When you leave, you'll have no
worries. We'll see to everything.

900
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:43,316
A good job on a good salary.

901
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:45,198
What job and how much?

902
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:49,828
You'll have an interesting job at
a salary you regard as adequate.

903
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:52,196
Not only for the job
you're going to do...

904
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:55,910
...and in compensation for what
you believe you have suffered...

905
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:59,630
...but also because
you are helping us.

906
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:02,359
Helping you?

907
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:05,592
We always help our friends,
don't we?

908
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:13,996
It is no secret
that this government...

909
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:17,277
...has lost a lot of popularity
because of you, my boy.

910
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:20,751
There are some who think that at
the next election we shall be out.

911
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,594
The press has chosen to take
a very unfavorable view...

912
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:25,193
...of what we tried to do.

913
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:29,271
But public opinion
has a way of changing.

914
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:31,158
And you, Alex...

915
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:33,152
...if I may call you Alex...

916
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:36,551
Certainly.
What do they call you at home?

917
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:39,068
My name is Frederick.

918
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,752
As I was saying, Alex...

919
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:46,676
...you can be instrumental
in changing the public's verdict.

920
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:51,791
Do you understand, Alex?

921
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:54,796
Do I make myself clear?

922
01:04:57,640 --> 01:04:59,835
As an unmuddied lake, Fred.

923
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:03,591
As clear as an azure sky
of deepest summer.

924
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:05,193
You can rely on me, Fred.

925
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:06,714
Good.

926
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:08,359
Good boy.

927
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:11,112
I understand you're fond of music.

928
01:05:11,360 --> 01:05:13,476
I have arranged a little
surprise for you.

929
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:15,113
Surprise?

930
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:16,998
One that I hope
that you will like...

931
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:18,559
...as a...

932
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:20,679
...how shall we put it...

933
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:23,992
...as a symbol of
our new understanding.

934
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:28,111
An understanding
between two friends.

935
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:47,394
<i>I was cured, all right!</i>

936
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:19,989
