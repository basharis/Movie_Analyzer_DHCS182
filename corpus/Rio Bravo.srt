1
00:04:43,409 --> 00:04:45,077
Joe, you're under arrest.

2
00:04:45,411 --> 00:04:47,955
Maybe so, but don't turn around, Sheriff.

3
00:04:48,581 --> 00:04:50,541
Now what're you going to do, Sheriff?

4
00:04:59,258 --> 00:05:01,469
You can do just about what you want.

5
00:05:04,681 --> 00:05:06,641
Anybody else you want besides Joe?

6
00:05:09,311 --> 00:05:10,103
No.

7
00:05:11,605 --> 00:05:12,898
Give me a hand.

8
00:06:03,157 --> 00:06:05,243
- What is all this?
- Hello, Mr. Wheeler.

9
00:06:05,326 --> 00:06:08,412
Tell your men to stay with the wagons
till they're told different.

10
00:06:08,496 --> 00:06:10,998
Who the devil do you think you're ordering
around here?

11
00:06:11,082 --> 00:06:14,460
First Burdette's men stop me
and now you stand there and try...

12
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:19,090
- Say, seems like I ought to know you.
- Think you do, Mr. Wheeler.

13
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:21,551
Yeah, I remember you now.

14
00:06:22,176 --> 00:06:25,097
That star you're wearing
kind of threw me off for a minute.

15
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:28,350
Aren't you the fellow
the Mexicans used to call borrachín?

16
00:06:29,017 --> 00:06:31,436
That's nearly right. Only it's borrachón.

17
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,439
I don't think I've ever seen you
like this before.

18
00:06:35,274 --> 00:06:38,026
You mean sober? You're probably right.

19
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:39,778
You know what borrachón means?

20
00:06:39,862 --> 00:06:41,822
My Spanish ain't too good.

21
00:06:41,947 --> 00:06:43,448
It means drunk.

22
00:06:43,866 --> 00:06:47,035
Now if the name bothers you,
they used to call me "Dude."

23
00:06:47,536 --> 00:06:49,913
Now are you going
to tell your men or do I?

24
00:06:50,622 --> 00:06:52,207
I'll tell my men.

25
00:06:57,713 --> 00:06:59,965
Stand by the wagons, everybody!

26
00:07:00,549 --> 00:07:01,758
Pass the word.

27
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:35,794
Chance, what's going on here?

28
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:39,130
People stopping me. Everybody telling me
what I can and can't do.

29
00:07:39,255 --> 00:07:41,424
Next thing, you'll be telling me what to do.

30
00:07:41,508 --> 00:07:43,176
- Pat, I will tell you.
- What?

31
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:45,721
- Stop your wagons.
- I give up.

32
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:53,646
Now don't tell me what's going on.
Just leave me wandering around in the fog.

33
00:07:53,771 --> 00:07:56,690
I like it. I'm getting used to it.
It makes me feel so good.

34
00:07:56,774 --> 00:07:59,485
You better look out, Pat,
you'll blow up and bust.

35
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:02,863
Listen, Chance, remember me?
Your old friend Pat Wheeler.

36
00:08:02,947 --> 00:08:05,032
- Now, will you please...
- Hey, Chance!

37
00:08:05,115 --> 00:08:08,702
What do you want to do about this outfit?
Do you want to take their guns?

38
00:08:08,786 --> 00:08:10,371
Got any new men with you, Pat?

39
00:08:10,454 --> 00:08:12,790
No, nobody except Colorado here.

40
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:15,501
- Where'd you take him on?
- Fort Worth.

41
00:08:15,626 --> 00:08:18,295
- What does he do?
- I speak English, Sheriff...

42
00:08:18,462 --> 00:08:20,256
...if you want to ask me.

43
00:08:23,634 --> 00:08:25,886
All right, buster, what do you do?

44
00:08:26,805 --> 00:08:28,348
I'm riding guard.

45
00:08:28,473 --> 00:08:30,433
Pretty young for that, aren't you?

46
00:08:30,559 --> 00:08:33,019
Just how old do you have to be, Sheriff?

47
00:08:33,812 --> 00:08:35,897
You remember Ryan from Denver,
don't you?

48
00:08:35,981 --> 00:08:37,190
Rocky Ryan?

49
00:08:37,315 --> 00:08:38,859
That's his boy.

50
00:08:39,151 --> 00:08:41,611
He tells me the kid's faster than he was.

51
00:08:41,736 --> 00:08:44,781
He better be, packing a pair of guns.

52
00:08:45,157 --> 00:08:49,744
Now, Sheriff, if it's the two guns that
bother you, I could give you one of them.

53
00:08:49,911 --> 00:08:51,621
I could let you have them both.

54
00:08:51,746 --> 00:08:53,832
They wouldn't do me too much good.

55
00:08:53,915 --> 00:08:56,877
That fellow in the door there
has a shotgun on me.

56
00:08:57,127 --> 00:09:00,755
- Stumpy, didn't I tell...
- I know. I'm going. I'm going.

57
00:09:04,342 --> 00:09:06,386
You can keep your guns, Colorado.

58
00:09:06,512 --> 00:09:09,307
Thanks, Sheriff. I don't want any trouble.

59
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,184
Well, then don't start any.

60
00:09:11,267 --> 00:09:13,686
I won't, unless I tell you first.

61
00:09:14,103 --> 00:09:15,605
That's good enough.

62
00:09:15,771 --> 00:09:18,357
Pat, you can put your wagons
in that corral.

63
00:09:18,524 --> 00:09:20,109
I ought to do just that.

64
00:09:20,193 --> 00:09:22,778
- What?
- I'm just guessing, you understand.

65
00:09:23,196 --> 00:09:25,948
It seems to me that you've already got
some trouble here.

66
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:27,366
You're guessing right.

67
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:31,370
It so happens that part of our load
there is fuel oil and dynamite.

68
00:09:31,454 --> 00:09:33,915
Would you like to have that
sitting next to you?

69
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,291
No, I wouldn't.

70
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:37,752
They could put them over there
by the creek.

71
00:09:37,835 --> 00:09:39,754
Near the Burdette warehouse.

72
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:42,924
If it's going to blow
that's just as good a place as any.

73
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:44,675
Show them the way, Dude.

74
00:09:44,801 --> 00:09:46,594
You can go along, Colorado.

75
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:49,264
Is that the way you want it, Mr. Wheeler?

76
00:09:51,225 --> 00:09:52,476
Go ahead.

77
00:10:08,742 --> 00:10:11,328
Let's get out of the middle of the street.

78
00:10:14,289 --> 00:10:17,876
Now that you're satisfied
and that the kid's got his guns...

79
00:10:18,627 --> 00:10:21,797
...would you mind telling me
what this is all about?

80
00:10:22,798 --> 00:10:24,883
We've got Joe Burdette in here.

81
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:29,597
- Joe Burdette in jail? Nathan's brother?
- That's right.

82
00:10:30,265 --> 00:10:32,142
What are you holding them for?

83
00:10:32,267 --> 00:10:35,478
They were about to bury the reason
when you were coming in.

84
00:10:35,687 --> 00:10:38,106
- Murder?
- No other word for it.

85
00:10:38,773 --> 00:10:41,109
No wonder this town's in such a mess.

86
00:10:41,734 --> 00:10:43,361
What does Nathan say about this?

87
00:10:43,486 --> 00:10:46,698
Nothing. He's not talking. Just doing.

88
00:10:46,781 --> 00:10:48,116
You saw part of it.

89
00:10:48,199 --> 00:10:53,454
He's got this town so bottled up
that I can't get Joe out or any help in.

90
00:10:55,415 --> 00:10:57,584
There are men over there watching us.

91
00:10:57,709 --> 00:10:59,127
They're his.

92
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:02,255
I can't make a move
without him knowing it.

93
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:04,048
Who you got helping you?

94
00:11:05,258 --> 00:11:07,010
You met half of them.

95
00:11:07,302 --> 00:11:11,056
You mean that fellow with the badge
that stopped me, and who else?

96
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:13,726
Stumpy. You know him.

97
00:11:14,185 --> 00:11:16,770
He's watching Joe and guarding the jail.

98
00:11:17,646 --> 00:11:21,233
A game-legged old man and a drunk.
That's all you got?

99
00:11:21,358 --> 00:11:22,985
That's what I got.

100
00:11:23,986 --> 00:11:28,240
If I ever saw a man holding the bull
by the tail, you're it.

101
00:11:29,909 --> 00:11:32,411
It's a good idea putting my wagons
where they're safe.

102
00:11:32,495 --> 00:11:34,538
Guess I better see they did it.

103
00:11:34,663 --> 00:11:36,165
I'll see you later.

104
00:11:49,262 --> 00:11:51,556
Better get back up there
and watch the road.

105
00:11:51,681 --> 00:11:53,225
You don't look so good.

106
00:11:53,433 --> 00:11:54,893
I feel worse.

107
00:11:55,268 --> 00:11:57,103
Think I'll stop off and get a beer.

108
00:11:57,187 --> 00:11:58,730
I thought you would.

109
00:11:59,022 --> 00:12:01,399
Got some in here. Cold.

110
00:12:01,691 --> 00:12:03,527
Just as long as it's beer.

111
00:12:10,033 --> 00:12:12,536
Stumpy, didn't I tell you
to stay out of sight?

112
00:12:12,619 --> 00:12:16,832
There you go. I never can please you.
I was just covering you in case of trouble.

113
00:12:16,957 --> 00:12:21,294
I'd be in more trouble if you'd have gotten
picked off while standing at that door.

114
00:12:21,378 --> 00:12:22,629
You'd be in trouble?

115
00:12:22,712 --> 00:12:24,798
What about me
if somebody gunned me down?

116
00:12:24,881 --> 00:12:26,800
Don't you never think of me?

117
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,679
Dude, I guess we better get used to it.

118
00:12:29,887 --> 00:12:32,849
Here's a fellow don't think of nobody
but himself.

119
00:12:32,974 --> 00:12:35,226
I told you why I want you back in there...

120
00:12:35,309 --> 00:12:38,813
...and you're going to stay there
with that cage locked when I'm not here.

121
00:12:38,896 --> 00:12:40,481
- You hear me?
- I heard you.

122
00:12:40,565 --> 00:12:42,233
Those windows, did you fix them?

123
00:12:42,316 --> 00:12:44,652
Them shutters is nailed up
tighter than a drum.

124
00:12:44,735 --> 00:12:46,279
Nothing could get in here.

125
00:12:46,404 --> 00:12:48,906
- Not even some fresh air.
- That's the way I want it.

126
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:51,284
You can help to change my life.
Can't help it.

127
00:12:51,409 --> 00:12:55,830
Five, six days breathing the same air
as Burdette might make a killer out of me.

128
00:12:55,913 --> 00:12:58,291
You can hear me back there,
can't you, Joe?

129
00:12:58,416 --> 00:13:01,669
I hear you all right, but I won't have
to listen to you for very long.

130
00:13:01,752 --> 00:13:04,088
Now, Joe, that's gratitude for you.

131
00:13:04,255 --> 00:13:07,258
After me fixing up all your cuts
and bruises like I done.

132
00:13:07,341 --> 00:13:09,887
I hope it happens again.
I won't do it, that's all.

133
00:13:10,012 --> 00:13:11,680
- Shut up!
- I take it back, Joe.

134
00:13:11,763 --> 00:13:14,850
If it does happen again,
I'll do just like I done before...

135
00:13:14,933 --> 00:13:18,103
...only I hope you have
more cuts and bruises to fix.

136
00:13:19,021 --> 00:13:21,607
Hey, Dude. Dude, come here a minute.

137
00:13:22,524 --> 00:13:23,984
What do you want?

138
00:13:24,359 --> 00:13:26,945
Why don't you sit in here
in place of Stumpy?

139
00:13:27,613 --> 00:13:30,032
I'd rather listen to a drunk than him.

140
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,243
How you holding up, borrachón?

141
00:13:33,785 --> 00:13:35,287
Got the shakes yet?

142
00:13:35,787 --> 00:13:40,042
That beer won't do you no good. You'll
have to get something stronger than that.

143
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:43,212
If you're still broke,
I think I got another dollar.

144
00:13:45,214 --> 00:13:48,467
- Chance, you going to let him do that?
- I'll do better than that.

145
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:51,930
I'll let him have the key to your cell
anytime he wants it.

146
00:13:56,309 --> 00:13:59,187
It'd be too easy.
He's got nobody to back him up.

147
00:14:00,313 --> 00:14:03,233
If he talks out of turn,
throw a bucket of water on him.

148
00:14:03,316 --> 00:14:06,611
I'll throw one in the middle of his bed
and leave him to sleep in it.

149
00:14:06,736 --> 00:14:08,154
Want another beer?

150
00:14:08,822 --> 00:14:10,698
You kind of wasted some of that last one.

151
00:14:10,824 --> 00:14:13,284
No, it wasn't wasted, except I missed him.

152
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:16,746
- I don't need any more.
- Hey, in the jail.

153
00:14:21,084 --> 00:14:23,419
That's far enough. What do you want?

154
00:14:23,586 --> 00:14:26,631
Mr. Wheeler said to bring this package
to the Sheriff.

155
00:14:26,923 --> 00:14:30,261
- You expecting a package?
- Be right out.

156
00:14:31,178 --> 00:14:32,888
- Stumpy?
- Yeah?

157
00:14:33,013 --> 00:14:35,349
Going over to the hotel for a few minutes.

158
00:14:35,432 --> 00:14:38,727
If you don't come back,
me and Joe will have us a good cry.

159
00:14:38,936 --> 00:14:40,813
Just keep that door locked.

160
00:14:42,523 --> 00:14:44,775
- Thanks for your trouble.
- No trouble at all.

161
00:14:44,859 --> 00:14:47,236
Wheeler says just be careful coming up.

162
00:14:48,612 --> 00:14:51,157
Looks like our friend's still on the job.

163
00:14:51,532 --> 00:14:52,491
Yeah.

164
00:14:53,117 --> 00:14:55,536
There's another one over by the church.

165
00:14:56,453 --> 00:14:58,205
Any use in arresting them?

166
00:14:58,873 --> 00:15:00,749
For just standing around?

167
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:03,002
All they'd do is get another one.

168
00:15:03,294 --> 00:15:05,588
The jail isn't big enough
to hold all of them.

169
00:15:05,713 --> 00:15:09,717
As a matter of fact,
they'd like to get a few in jail.

170
00:15:09,884 --> 00:15:11,344
Remember that.

171
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:19,019
Señor Chance. I've been looking for you.
I have a message for...

172
00:15:19,144 --> 00:15:22,355
- What you have here?
- The package you've been waiting for.

173
00:15:22,481 --> 00:15:24,566
Just in time.

174
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,986
- Carlos! Where you are?
- I'm over here.

175
00:15:28,069 --> 00:15:29,821
You keep it. Consuelo, she comes now.

176
00:15:29,905 --> 00:15:32,491
If you break the dishes,
you'll see what happens.

177
00:15:32,574 --> 00:15:35,785
Every day is the same thing... Carlos.
Oh Señor Chance.

178
00:15:35,994 --> 00:15:37,913
I just ask Carlos if he's...

179
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:40,457
Carlos, what is wrong?

180
00:15:40,999 --> 00:15:43,710
You look like the cat
who swallows the chicken.

181
00:15:43,835 --> 00:15:46,963
- What have you been doing?
- What have I been doing?

182
00:15:47,088 --> 00:15:50,592
I've been talking to my friend the sheriff,
that's what I have been doing.

183
00:15:50,675 --> 00:15:52,178
We have important business.

184
00:15:52,261 --> 00:15:54,514
You say I look like the cat
who eats too much.

185
00:15:54,597 --> 00:15:56,390
Consuelo, look at me.

186
00:15:56,599 --> 00:15:57,600
Am I fat?

187
00:15:57,683 --> 00:16:00,728
- I did not say you are fat.
- Please, Consuelo, do not say more.

188
00:16:00,853 --> 00:16:02,522
You already say too much.

189
00:16:02,605 --> 00:16:05,024
Me and my friend
will make our business alone.

190
00:16:05,107 --> 00:16:06,275
Come.

191
00:16:12,365 --> 00:16:14,909
The thing is if he ate the chicken or not.

192
00:16:15,284 --> 00:16:16,577
I'm going to see.

193
00:16:17,286 --> 00:16:19,080
You take chances, my friend.

194
00:16:19,205 --> 00:16:20,540
Because I know woman.

195
00:16:20,623 --> 00:16:22,875
If she will be mad or she will be sorry.

196
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:25,586
If it is mad,
she will be much pleasure to make right.

197
00:16:25,711 --> 00:16:28,297
And if she is sorry,
it will be the same pleasure.

198
00:16:28,381 --> 00:16:30,258
You do not have women.

199
00:16:30,383 --> 00:16:31,885
So you do not know.

200
00:16:31,969 --> 00:16:34,847
But me, Carlos Remonte, I know.

201
00:16:36,056 --> 00:16:38,725
Wait till I show you
what is in this package.

202
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:42,896
Then you tell me
if I do not know about women.

203
00:16:43,647 --> 00:16:47,943
If I had bought these myself,
everyone in town would have known.

204
00:16:48,819 --> 00:16:53,532
And it's not the sort of thing that Consuelo
would like to have known by everyone.

205
00:16:58,245 --> 00:16:59,204
You see?

206
00:17:00,831 --> 00:17:02,749
Are they not beautiful?

207
00:17:03,417 --> 00:17:05,919
Can you make the picture
how she will look?

208
00:17:06,086 --> 00:17:07,921
You sure you want me to do that?

209
00:17:08,005 --> 00:17:09,173
No.

210
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:12,218
Do not make the picture.
It is best for me to do it.

211
00:17:12,343 --> 00:17:15,346
I beg your pardon, gentlemen,
but I'm looking for a...

212
00:17:17,015 --> 00:17:20,185
Those things have great possibilities,
but not for you.

213
00:17:23,188 --> 00:17:24,856
What are you doing here?

214
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:29,777
Until I saw those things, I was looking
for a towel. I'd like to take a bath.

215
00:17:29,861 --> 00:17:32,447
- Didn't you come in on the stage?
- That's right.

216
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:34,115
Why aren't you on it?

217
00:17:34,532 --> 00:17:37,243
Whoever heard of a stagecoach
having a bathroom?

218
00:17:37,368 --> 00:17:40,413
Chihuahua, I forgot.
I start to tell you and I forgot.

219
00:17:40,538 --> 00:17:42,290
The stage, she did not go.

220
00:17:42,874 --> 00:17:43,583
Why?

221
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:46,127
- Something happened with the wheel.
- Where's Jake?

222
00:17:46,211 --> 00:17:49,088
Near the corral.
He must fix the wheel before he can leave.

223
00:17:49,214 --> 00:17:50,590
That's just fine.

224
00:17:53,719 --> 00:17:55,971
Hey, Sheriff, you forgot your pants.

225
00:18:47,941 --> 00:18:50,152
You reckon they'll try anything tonight?

226
00:18:50,277 --> 00:18:53,572
Could be. Nathan Burdette's smart.
Don't underrate him.

227
00:18:53,655 --> 00:18:55,407
That ain't no kind of answer.

228
00:18:55,532 --> 00:18:57,993
How or what he'll do, I don't know.

229
00:18:58,785 --> 00:19:00,537
Your guess is as good as mine.

230
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:02,622
What I want to know is when.

231
00:19:03,456 --> 00:19:05,500
I wish he'd hurry up and do it.

232
00:19:16,637 --> 00:19:18,389
Have a bottle of beer, Dude?

233
00:19:18,473 --> 00:19:20,308
I'm full of beer.

234
00:19:21,309 --> 00:19:23,227
It doesn't do any good.

235
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:26,522
It'll start working on you tomorrow
or the next day.

236
00:19:32,111 --> 00:19:33,070
Stumpy.

237
00:19:34,197 --> 00:19:36,782
We're going to take a turn
around the town.

238
00:19:37,825 --> 00:19:40,119
- You be all right?
- 'Course I'll be all right.

239
00:19:40,244 --> 00:19:42,038
Then get in there where you belong.

240
00:19:42,163 --> 00:19:44,749
I'm going. But you remember one thing:

241
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:48,419
When you come back,
you holler before you open that door.

242
00:19:48,544 --> 00:19:51,005
I'm liable to blast you
just for the heck of it.

243
00:19:51,088 --> 00:19:52,340
We'll holler.

244
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:02,726
You got any particular reason
for going out tonight?

245
00:20:02,851 --> 00:20:04,019
Usually do.

246
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:08,065
Don't want to do anything different,
they might think we're scared.

247
00:20:08,357 --> 00:20:09,691
Aren't we?

248
00:20:11,527 --> 00:20:13,946
I just can't take it sitting in there.

249
00:20:14,071 --> 00:20:16,323
You mean you saw I couldn't take it.

250
00:20:16,865 --> 00:20:19,451
Don't set yourself up as being so special.

251
00:20:20,077 --> 00:20:22,204
Think you invented the hangover.

252
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:25,332
I could sure take out a patent for this one.

253
00:20:28,877 --> 00:20:30,212
Take that side.

254
00:21:06,457 --> 00:21:07,709
Good evening.

255
00:22:25,163 --> 00:22:26,998
Hold it, Dude. Stairway.

256
00:22:27,499 --> 00:22:29,125
Don't shoot, Sheriff.

257
00:22:29,251 --> 00:22:31,086
Just getting a little air.

258
00:23:05,454 --> 00:23:06,747
I'm getting jumpy.

259
00:23:06,873 --> 00:23:09,417
I'll walk along with you
and hold your hand.

260
00:23:09,542 --> 00:23:12,461
- Get back over there where you belong.
- Yes, Papa.

261
00:23:26,643 --> 00:23:29,438
- Carlos.
- Señor Chance. I been looking for you.

262
00:23:29,563 --> 00:23:31,648
- It is very bad.
- What's wrong?

263
00:23:31,732 --> 00:23:33,901
- Your friend Señor Wheeler.
- What about him?

264
00:23:33,984 --> 00:23:37,821
He is a good friend
and he wishes good for you, so he talks.

265
00:23:37,905 --> 00:23:40,407
He talks to people. He talk to everybody.

266
00:23:40,574 --> 00:23:43,827
He say why they don't help you,
that you should have some more help.

267
00:23:43,911 --> 00:23:45,621
He's right.

268
00:23:45,746 --> 00:23:48,415
But is no good to say such things
to the wrong people.

269
00:23:48,499 --> 00:23:50,375
- You tell him.
- Is he in there?

270
00:23:50,501 --> 00:23:51,668
Sí, I think.

271
00:23:53,587 --> 00:23:55,589
Chance, he's over there.

272
00:23:56,674 --> 00:23:57,967
The kings full.

273
00:23:58,176 --> 00:24:00,053
That's good. Beats me.

274
00:24:08,436 --> 00:24:10,230
Spare a minute, Pat?

275
00:24:10,355 --> 00:24:11,731
Good evening, Sheriff.

276
00:24:11,856 --> 00:24:12,982
Deal me out.

277
00:24:13,107 --> 00:24:14,150
Evening.

278
00:24:24,619 --> 00:24:26,371
You two know each other.

279
00:24:26,621 --> 00:24:27,539
Yeah.

280
00:24:27,789 --> 00:24:29,332
No thanks, Carlos.

281
00:24:29,874 --> 00:24:31,751
I've been wanting to talk to you.

282
00:24:31,876 --> 00:24:33,628
You've been talking too much.

283
00:24:33,711 --> 00:24:36,422
- What do you mean "talking too much"?
- Anybody that...

284
00:24:36,548 --> 00:24:41,053
...sides in with me right now's liable to find
themselves up to their ears in trouble.

285
00:24:41,136 --> 00:24:44,139
Is that why you haven't asked for
any deputies?

286
00:24:44,223 --> 00:24:48,018
Give me a new deck of cards.
I'm not having any luck with this one.

287
00:24:48,561 --> 00:24:51,689
I was talking about why you haven't
asked for any new deputies.

288
00:24:51,814 --> 00:24:53,023
You could get some.

289
00:24:53,149 --> 00:24:55,151
How about my drivers?
You could use them.

290
00:24:55,234 --> 00:24:57,570
Suppose I got them, what would I have?

291
00:24:57,736 --> 00:24:59,572
Some well-meaning amateurs.

292
00:24:59,655 --> 00:25:02,491
Most of them worried
about their wives and kids.

293
00:25:03,242 --> 00:25:06,162
Burdette has 30 or 40 men,
all professionals.

294
00:25:06,495 --> 00:25:09,915
Only things they're worried
about is earning their pay.

295
00:25:10,749 --> 00:25:15,254
No, Pat, all I'd be doing is giving them
more targets to shoot at.

296
00:25:15,671 --> 00:25:17,674
A lot of people would get hurt.

297
00:25:18,091 --> 00:25:19,634
Joe Burdette isn't worth it.

298
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:22,345
He isn't worth one of those
that would get killed.

299
00:25:22,429 --> 00:25:24,181
Then what are you going to do?

300
00:25:24,264 --> 00:25:27,267
All you got for help is that old man
down at the jail and this...

301
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:29,811
Borrachón is the name,
Mr. Wheeler.

302
00:25:30,437 --> 00:25:33,106
I'll go outside so you can talk more freely.

303
00:25:37,694 --> 00:25:39,154
Wasn't good, Pat.

304
00:25:39,613 --> 00:25:41,114
Let's sit down.

305
00:25:41,281 --> 00:25:42,741
Yeah, I know.

306
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:44,826
I shouldn't have said it.

307
00:25:44,951 --> 00:25:46,828
I meant nothing by it.

308
00:25:47,204 --> 00:25:49,873
But I'm so used to stumbling
over that fellow.

309
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,834
I don't think I ever saw him
standing on his own two feet...

310
00:25:52,959 --> 00:25:54,961
...without something to hold him up.

311
00:25:55,045 --> 00:25:56,838
How long you been coming here?

312
00:25:56,963 --> 00:25:58,424
Going on two years.

313
00:25:58,549 --> 00:26:02,303
If you'd have come through three years
ago, you wouldn't have stumbled over him.

314
00:26:02,386 --> 00:26:03,888
Dude was good.

315
00:26:04,222 --> 00:26:05,431
He was my deputy.

316
00:26:05,556 --> 00:26:07,725
Best man with a gun I ever worked with.

317
00:26:07,808 --> 00:26:10,102
That's pretty hard to believe, Chance.

318
00:26:11,312 --> 00:26:14,565
A girl. Just a girl
that came through on the stage.

319
00:26:15,066 --> 00:26:17,652
She was no good,
but couldn't tell him that.

320
00:26:17,735 --> 00:26:20,029
I tried and he damn near killed me.

321
00:26:21,322 --> 00:26:22,949
Anyway, he was hooked.

322
00:26:23,324 --> 00:26:24,492
Went away with her.

323
00:26:24,575 --> 00:26:27,161
Six months later
he came back without her.

324
00:26:27,245 --> 00:26:30,623
That's when the Mexicans
started calling him borrachón.

325
00:26:30,748 --> 00:26:32,750
- That's Spanish for...
- I know.

326
00:26:33,251 --> 00:26:34,418
He told me.

327
00:26:35,253 --> 00:26:38,214
So, for two years he's been drinking...

328
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:43,846
...all he could buy, or somebody would buy
for him until last night.

329
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,765
And how long do you think that'll last?

330
00:26:46,849 --> 00:26:48,100
I don't know.

331
00:26:48,851 --> 00:26:51,895
So in the meantime,
you have to take care of him.

332
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:54,982
He's been doing a pretty good job
of taking care of me.

333
00:26:56,859 --> 00:26:59,111
I'm supposed to be your friend, too.

334
00:26:59,862 --> 00:27:02,865
- Why don't you let me help you?
- You're not good enough.

335
00:27:02,948 --> 00:27:04,616
I don't know! I'm as good...

336
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:07,995
If you're so good,
why did you have to hire Colorado?

337
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,872
No thanks, you keep out of it.

338
00:27:09,955 --> 00:27:11,039
That's an idea.

339
00:27:11,123 --> 00:27:13,876
- What?
- Ryan. "Colorado," you call him.

340
00:27:14,209 --> 00:27:16,920
He's young, Chance, but he's good.
Real good.

341
00:27:17,462 --> 00:27:20,592
I could use him if he's good.
But that's up to him.

342
00:27:21,301 --> 00:27:23,011
We'll see what he says.

343
00:27:42,822 --> 00:27:44,282
Good evening, Sheriff.

344
00:27:44,407 --> 00:27:45,783
Any luck, kid?

345
00:27:46,242 --> 00:27:48,703
- It's a pretty fast game.
- Son, I...

346
00:27:48,995 --> 00:27:52,248
...asked you over here
because the Sheriff's a friend of mine.

347
00:27:52,332 --> 00:27:55,126
He's got trouble. He can use a good man.

348
00:27:55,835 --> 00:27:57,754
To go against the Burdettes, Sheriff?

349
00:27:57,837 --> 00:27:59,130
That's right.

350
00:27:59,423 --> 00:28:01,634
I told him you were one of the best.

351
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:08,724
I'll tell you what I'm a lot better at,
Mr. Wheeler.

352
00:28:08,849 --> 00:28:10,851
That's minding my own business.

353
00:28:11,435 --> 00:28:12,978
No offense, Sheriff.

354
00:28:13,854 --> 00:28:15,022
No offense.

355
00:28:21,195 --> 00:28:23,030
I never expected that.

356
00:28:23,197 --> 00:28:25,032
He showed good sense.

357
00:28:25,533 --> 00:28:27,785
- I'd like to have him.
- I don't see why you...

358
00:28:27,868 --> 00:28:29,995
Quit stewing, Pat. You tried.

359
00:28:30,204 --> 00:28:31,622
I appreciate it.

360
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:34,291
If you don't want me,
I'll round up my men...

361
00:28:34,375 --> 00:28:38,420
...and get set for an early start
in the morning. See you before I go.

362
00:28:42,634 --> 00:28:44,052
Enough for me for a while.

363
00:28:44,135 --> 00:28:45,428
You leaving?

364
00:28:45,554 --> 00:28:48,515
- Maybe I'll have some luck now.
- Maybe.

365
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,600
If you play your cards right.

366
00:28:50,725 --> 00:28:52,978
Hope you leave some of your luck with me.

367
00:28:53,061 --> 00:28:55,564
I'll come back and give it to you next time.

368
00:28:55,647 --> 00:28:57,148
We'll ante up.

369
00:28:59,568 --> 00:29:00,443
Dude?

370
00:29:00,569 --> 00:29:01,486
Yeah?

371
00:29:02,404 --> 00:29:04,614
I'll be out in a couple of minutes.

372
00:29:25,178 --> 00:29:26,596
Hi, Sheriff.

373
00:29:27,263 --> 00:29:29,849
I'm sorry about those pants.

374
00:29:30,266 --> 00:29:32,059
Carlos told me they weren't yours.

375
00:29:32,185 --> 00:29:35,062
You're in trouble, lady.
I'd like to talk to you.

376
00:29:36,522 --> 00:29:37,607
Sure.

377
00:29:42,778 --> 00:29:44,572
Sheriff, what is it?

378
00:29:45,198 --> 00:29:48,784
I was looking through the deck of cards
you people were using.

379
00:29:49,619 --> 00:29:51,287
Three cards short.

380
00:29:51,954 --> 00:29:53,831
Pretty obvious ones, aces.

381
00:29:55,958 --> 00:29:57,418
Why do you tell me?

382
00:29:57,710 --> 00:30:02,049
I know everyone in that game except you
and the fellow in the checkered vest.

383
00:30:02,299 --> 00:30:04,676
- And did you talk to him?
- He's still there.

384
00:30:04,801 --> 00:30:06,094
You were leaving.

385
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:07,971
And I was a winner.

386
00:30:09,556 --> 00:30:11,683
Is that all you've got to go on?

387
00:30:12,476 --> 00:30:15,854
No. Here's a handbill...

388
00:30:17,314 --> 00:30:20,651
...about a gambler they're interested in
catching up with.

389
00:30:20,901 --> 00:30:22,361
You know him?

390
00:30:22,903 --> 00:30:24,780
Says he had a girl with him.

391
00:30:25,656 --> 00:30:29,910
Says the girl's about 22,
5 foot 5 inches tall...

392
00:30:30,577 --> 00:30:34,706
...good figure, brown hair,
and wears feathers.

393
00:30:37,167 --> 00:30:40,212
Now, the man isn't our...

394
00:30:40,337 --> 00:30:43,842
...friend in the checkered vest
but you could be the girl.

395
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:46,344
Yes, I could be.

396
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:50,098
As a matter of fact, I am.

397
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:55,687
Make sure you're on the stage
in the morning.

398
00:30:55,770 --> 00:31:00,692
You'd better give me the money you won,
I'll see that it gets back to the right people.

399
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:03,403
It's pretty easy, isn't it?

400
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:07,949
Just give you the money
and get on the stage.

401
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:12,078
But I'm not going to make it that easy.

402
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:16,040
You've made me mad, Sheriff.
You didn't ask me if I took those cards.

403
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:18,501
So, you're going to have to prove
I've got them.

404
00:31:18,626 --> 00:31:21,129
The only way I know you can do that
is to search me.

405
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:22,965
- Search you?
- That's right.

406
00:31:23,132 --> 00:31:26,010
Isn't that what a sheriff usually does
to a prisoner?

407
00:31:26,135 --> 00:31:29,680
Let's see, the cards could be in my purse...

408
00:31:29,805 --> 00:31:31,432
...but they're not.

409
00:31:32,224 --> 00:31:34,977
They could be in my shoes,
my stockings, garters.

410
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:38,314
- All right, all right.
- I don't wear anything like those red pants.

411
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:41,483
And my sleeves are too tight,
but there's my waist.

412
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:44,653
You've got a job to do,
where do you intend to begin?

413
00:31:44,737 --> 00:31:47,698
- That's about enough.
- You have to prove I've got those cards.

414
00:31:47,823 --> 00:31:50,910
- You keep going, and I'm apt to do it!
- I'm not so sure.

415
00:31:52,244 --> 00:31:54,038
I think you're embarrassed.

416
00:31:54,163 --> 00:31:56,332
- And if you're not...
- lf he's not...

417
00:31:56,415 --> 00:31:57,500
...he ought to be.

418
00:31:57,583 --> 00:31:59,376
What're you doing here?

419
00:31:59,585 --> 00:32:01,587
I don't think she has the cards.

420
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:03,882
If that's what you're looking for.

421
00:32:04,591 --> 00:32:06,051
How do you know?

422
00:32:06,176 --> 00:32:08,470
The fellow in the checkered vest has them.

423
00:32:08,595 --> 00:32:10,263
Why didn't you find out?

424
00:32:10,347 --> 00:32:13,099
I said I wouldn't start anything
till I told you first.

425
00:32:13,183 --> 00:32:15,644
I'm telling you.
I'm going to see if he's got them.

426
00:32:15,769 --> 00:32:17,229
Wait a minute.

427
00:32:18,271 --> 00:32:20,524
- You want to come along?
- I do.

428
00:32:20,857 --> 00:32:22,400
I'm interested, too.

429
00:32:42,295 --> 00:32:43,714
Ace high straight.

430
00:32:44,131 --> 00:32:46,300
Looks like I got the lady's luck.

431
00:32:47,468 --> 00:32:49,595
All right, keep your hands on the table.

432
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,305
Right where they are.

433
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,851
Put your hands back.

434
00:32:55,059 --> 00:32:56,394
Where they were.

435
00:33:10,241 --> 00:33:11,492
Holdout.

436
00:33:12,410 --> 00:33:14,078
He's all yours, Sheriff.

437
00:33:14,412 --> 00:33:15,454
Get up.

438
00:33:16,831 --> 00:33:17,915
Get up!

439
00:33:19,667 --> 00:33:22,336
We don't like tinhorns around here, mister.

440
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:24,882
Carlos, lock him in his room.

441
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:27,509
Let him out in time for the stage.

442
00:33:27,843 --> 00:33:30,888
You losers can help yourself
to what's on the table.

443
00:33:31,513 --> 00:33:32,681
Thanks, Colorado.

444
00:33:32,764 --> 00:33:35,601
Sheriff, aren't you forgetting something?

445
00:33:45,944 --> 00:33:49,781
I guess I was wrong about you
having those cards.

446
00:33:50,699 --> 00:33:52,284
Is that all, Sheriff?

447
00:33:52,534 --> 00:33:55,621
I'm not going to apologize,
if that's what you mean.

448
00:33:55,954 --> 00:33:58,624
We haven't gotten past that handbill,
have we?

449
00:33:58,707 --> 00:33:59,958
That's right.

450
00:34:00,209 --> 00:34:03,212
You haven't done anything
to make me think we will.

451
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:06,883
Idea of being searched
didn't bother you much.

452
00:34:07,217 --> 00:34:08,259
Made a joke of it.

453
00:34:08,384 --> 00:34:10,970
Instead of me being embarrassed,
you were.

454
00:34:11,137 --> 00:34:14,390
Tell me, Sheriff, what should I have done?

455
00:34:15,058 --> 00:34:16,518
I'd like to know.

456
00:34:16,893 --> 00:34:19,854
This isn't the first time
that handbill has come up.

457
00:34:19,979 --> 00:34:22,273
I'd like to know what to do about it.

458
00:34:22,649 --> 00:34:25,944
You could quit playing cards...

459
00:34:26,736 --> 00:34:28,238
...wearing feathers.

460
00:34:28,321 --> 00:34:29,739
No, Sheriff.

461
00:34:31,407 --> 00:34:33,326
No, I'm not going to do that.

462
00:34:34,410 --> 00:34:37,705
You see, that's what I'd do...

463
00:34:39,749 --> 00:34:42,669
...if I were the kind of girl
that you think I am.

464
00:35:02,606 --> 00:35:04,191
Dude, you seen Wheeler?

465
00:35:04,275 --> 00:35:06,235
Not since he went up the street.

466
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,320
I think that's him coming now.

467
00:35:21,959 --> 00:35:23,502
Get him out of here.

468
00:35:29,384 --> 00:35:32,262
Watch the stable.
That's where the shot came from.

469
00:35:34,723 --> 00:35:36,474
Got him in the back.

470
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,226
He's dead.

471
00:35:40,812 --> 00:35:44,733
Didn't take them long,
less than an hour after he offered to help.

472
00:35:46,234 --> 00:35:48,361
Ain't got many friends like that.

473
00:35:50,071 --> 00:35:51,490
You were smart, Colorado.

474
00:35:51,573 --> 00:35:54,743
- No one's come out of the stable.
- I want to go with you.

475
00:35:54,826 --> 00:35:57,579
Want to help get the man
that killed your boss?

476
00:35:57,829 --> 00:36:00,582
- Wouldn't you?
- I wouldn't have let him get shot.

477
00:36:00,665 --> 00:36:03,335
You had a chance to get in this
and you didn't want it.

478
00:36:03,418 --> 00:36:05,421
Stay out, we don't need you.

479
00:36:05,505 --> 00:36:08,716
If you want to do something,
get him out of the street.

480
00:36:12,845 --> 00:36:16,098
Get around to the side
where you can see front and back.

481
00:36:16,474 --> 00:36:17,725
How you going in?

482
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:21,145
Right through the door.
If he comes out, you can have him.

483
00:36:21,604 --> 00:36:24,023
There's no sense in me
telling you to cool down.

484
00:36:24,106 --> 00:36:25,483
No, there isn't.

485
00:36:25,566 --> 00:36:26,692
I thought so.

486
00:36:26,776 --> 00:36:28,986
I'll let you know when I get there.

487
00:37:33,761 --> 00:37:35,388
Chance, you all right?

488
00:37:52,197 --> 00:37:53,823
Chance, out here.

489
00:37:54,991 --> 00:37:56,159
You all right?

490
00:37:56,284 --> 00:37:58,286
Just dirt in my eyes. Did you get him?

491
00:37:58,369 --> 00:38:00,330
He came out the door, running fast.

492
00:38:00,455 --> 00:38:02,624
- You missed him.
- I couldn't get a good shot.

493
00:38:02,707 --> 00:38:06,212
- Might've winged him.
- Don't worry. It's my fault we lost him.

494
00:38:06,295 --> 00:38:07,713
He hasn't got away yet...

495
00:38:07,796 --> 00:38:10,591
...or I wouldn't be standing here.
He went in the saloon.

496
00:38:10,716 --> 00:38:13,052
- He's still in there.
- How do you know?

497
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:15,137
Can see both doors from here.

498
00:38:15,221 --> 00:38:17,056
And there ain't any others.

499
00:38:17,556 --> 00:38:19,266
I'm an expert on saloons.

500
00:38:20,017 --> 00:38:22,561
- Get a chance to see who he was?
- No, but we'll know.

501
00:38:22,645 --> 00:38:26,649
He'll have muddy boots.
He stepped in that puddle by the trough.

502
00:38:27,483 --> 00:38:29,735
You figure we're going in there after him?

503
00:38:29,818 --> 00:38:31,529
- Aren't we?
- We used to.

504
00:38:32,404 --> 00:38:35,032
There's eight or ten Burdette men in there.

505
00:38:35,908 --> 00:38:37,284
Maybe more.

506
00:38:38,661 --> 00:38:41,455
You take the back door, I'll go in the front.

507
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:42,748
I'd like to try...

508
00:38:42,832 --> 00:38:44,583
You'd like to try what?

509
00:38:45,835 --> 00:38:47,838
I been going in the back door.

510
00:38:48,088 --> 00:38:50,674
They haven't been letting me in the front.

511
00:38:52,008 --> 00:38:53,844
Think you're good enough?

512
00:38:53,927 --> 00:38:55,512
I'd like to find out.

513
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,013
So would I.

514
00:38:57,806 --> 00:39:00,350
I'll let you know when I get around back.

515
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:04,540
Begin with you, Charlie.

516
00:40:05,249 --> 00:40:07,460
That shotgun you keep under the bar.

517
00:40:08,462 --> 00:40:10,214
Pick it up by the barrel.

518
00:40:10,923 --> 00:40:11,965
Easy.

519
00:40:12,090 --> 00:40:15,844
Thought you were going to ask for a drink.
It's been a long dry spell.

520
00:40:16,011 --> 00:40:17,262
Shotgun first.

521
00:40:18,096 --> 00:40:19,223
Set it down.

522
00:40:20,682 --> 00:40:21,892
Back up.

523
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:29,983
Jim, Pedro, get over there.

524
00:40:37,407 --> 00:40:41,370
All right, the rest of you,
I'm not going to tell you twice.

525
00:40:42,204 --> 00:40:45,457
You're going to stand up
and stand real still.

526
00:40:46,458 --> 00:40:47,417
Now!

527
00:40:52,006 --> 00:40:56,928
All right, now one by one,
start with you, unbuckle your guns...

528
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:59,013
...drop them and step back.

529
00:41:01,724 --> 00:41:02,725
Come on.

530
00:41:09,899 --> 00:41:12,569
There's no reason for you to move, Charlie.

531
00:41:16,406 --> 00:41:17,740
What's this all about?

532
00:41:17,907 --> 00:41:20,410
We're looking for a man that ran in here.

533
00:41:20,577 --> 00:41:22,120
Nobody's run in here.

534
00:41:22,245 --> 00:41:24,414
We'll remember you said that.

535
00:41:26,749 --> 00:41:29,128
Man we're looking for has muddy boots.

536
00:41:29,837 --> 00:41:32,089
Now, one by one, hold up your feet.

537
00:41:47,855 --> 00:41:49,857
Who saw a man run in here?

538
00:41:51,025 --> 00:41:52,067
I did.

539
00:41:53,444 --> 00:41:56,113
Almost forgot about you, Charlie.
Come on out.

540
00:41:57,865 --> 00:41:59,533
Clean as a whistle.

541
00:42:00,117 --> 00:42:02,286
Dude, you been seeing things again.

542
00:42:02,369 --> 00:42:04,079
You better have a drink.

543
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:07,291
Dude.

544
00:42:08,918 --> 00:42:10,378
Maybe this'll help.

545
00:42:52,505 --> 00:42:55,049
Guess I'll take that drink now, Charlie.

546
00:42:55,550 --> 00:42:57,301
Kind of thought you would.

547
00:43:04,934 --> 00:43:06,936
You want that gun, pick it up.

548
00:43:08,437 --> 00:43:09,856
I wish you would.

549
00:43:15,111 --> 00:43:17,154
Stepped in a puddle all right.

550
00:43:17,989 --> 00:43:19,740
It's the fellow we wanted.

551
00:43:22,159 --> 00:43:23,661
I guess this is his.

552
00:43:23,786 --> 00:43:26,038
A nice, fresh $50 gold piece.

553
00:43:26,873 --> 00:43:30,711
It's just about what Burdette would figure
a man's life was worth.

554
00:43:31,295 --> 00:43:33,422
That's earning money the hard way.

555
00:43:37,009 --> 00:43:38,343
Paid killer.

556
00:43:39,636 --> 00:43:42,639
Nice, fresh $50 gold piece.

557
00:43:44,558 --> 00:43:47,060
You, mister, you got one in your pocket?

558
00:43:47,311 --> 00:43:48,687
Nobody paid me.

559
00:43:49,021 --> 00:43:50,230
Nobody!

560
00:43:50,731 --> 00:43:53,275
And nobody run in here, either, huh?

561
00:43:54,401 --> 00:43:55,319
Chance.

562
00:43:55,402 --> 00:43:57,362
I'm not going to hurt him.

563
00:43:57,613 --> 00:43:58,572
Get up!

564
00:44:00,324 --> 00:44:01,825
You're all in it.

565
00:44:02,826 --> 00:44:04,411
The whole lot of you.

566
00:44:05,579 --> 00:44:07,623
You're going to get out of town.

567
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:09,958
Take your boy here with you.

568
00:44:11,252 --> 00:44:13,630
You can tell Burdette you got Wheeler.

569
00:44:14,422 --> 00:44:17,842
You can tell anybody else he sends,
he'd better pay them more...

570
00:44:17,926 --> 00:44:20,220
...because they're going to earn it.

571
00:44:21,429 --> 00:44:23,389
Charlie, I want you to...

572
00:44:26,351 --> 00:44:28,061
You finished yet, Dude?

573
00:44:28,603 --> 00:44:29,687
You in a hurry?

574
00:44:29,771 --> 00:44:31,064
Not especially.

575
00:44:42,116 --> 00:44:44,661
You threw the silver dollar, didn't you?

576
00:44:44,786 --> 00:44:46,955
- Yeah, Dude, I...
- You want it back?

577
00:44:47,914 --> 00:44:49,874
- Sure.
- You know how to get it?

578
00:44:52,378 --> 00:44:53,337
Yeah.

579
00:45:10,396 --> 00:45:12,189
That's all for me, Chance.

580
00:45:12,815 --> 00:45:15,317
- Charlie, come here.
- Yeah, Sheriff.

581
00:45:15,401 --> 00:45:16,777
You're going with us.

582
00:45:16,861 --> 00:45:18,779
Why pick on me? Why choose me?

583
00:45:18,904 --> 00:45:21,615
You're carrying these guns
down to the jail for us.

584
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:24,076
All right, back up and give him room.

585
00:45:27,997 --> 00:45:30,541
I guess they'll let you
in the front door from now on.

586
00:45:37,591 --> 00:45:41,094
You mean to tell me you followed him
into Burdette's saloon?

587
00:45:41,595 --> 00:45:43,180
Why, you're crazy!

588
00:45:43,263 --> 00:45:45,599
And you are, too. What happened?

589
00:45:46,266 --> 00:45:47,684
He was hiding in the loft.

590
00:45:47,767 --> 00:45:48,852
Who got him?

591
00:45:48,935 --> 00:45:50,645
Dude did. One shot.

592
00:45:51,855 --> 00:45:53,607
I wish I could've seen that.

593
00:45:53,690 --> 00:45:55,650
I wish Wheeler could've, too.

594
00:45:56,109 --> 00:45:58,862
Wheeler didn't think
Dude and me was much good.

595
00:45:59,029 --> 00:46:01,948
Leastways it would've showed him
he was wrong about Dude.

596
00:46:02,032 --> 00:46:04,242
He was wrong about Dude, all right.

597
00:46:04,701 --> 00:46:06,703
You were good in there tonight.

598
00:46:07,287 --> 00:46:09,122
Good as you've ever been.

599
00:46:09,456 --> 00:46:12,210
But you know one reason
why you got by with it?

600
00:46:12,627 --> 00:46:16,297
They were laughing at you.
Borrachón talking big.

601
00:46:16,631 --> 00:46:20,051
You surprised them.
But next time they'll be ready for you.

602
00:46:20,134 --> 00:46:22,720
Next time they'll shoot first
and laugh afterwards.

603
00:46:22,803 --> 00:46:25,431
- Listen to him.
- Don't get too cocksure.

604
00:46:25,556 --> 00:46:27,475
What a stinker! Spit in his eye.

605
00:46:27,558 --> 00:46:30,061
Never mind him,
he's always been a stinker.

606
00:46:30,144 --> 00:46:32,772
If he were to change, that would worry me.

607
00:46:34,649 --> 00:46:37,193
You'd think I could get one
out of a whole sack.

608
00:46:37,318 --> 00:46:39,904
How'd you know
that fellow was in the loft?

609
00:46:40,321 --> 00:46:43,824
He was losing blood.
It was dripping into a drink on the bar.

610
00:46:43,991 --> 00:46:46,702
Just when I couldn't find anybody
with muddy boots.

611
00:46:46,827 --> 00:46:48,788
I could've sure used a drink then.

612
00:46:48,913 --> 00:46:51,999
If he was bleeding that means
you hit him on the run outside.

613
00:46:52,083 --> 00:46:55,337
You did, Dude? Say, that ain't bad.
That ain't bad at all.

614
00:46:55,504 --> 00:46:58,590
Ain't good either.
We had to go in after him.

615
00:46:59,591 --> 00:47:03,053
Chance, nobody please you no how?

616
00:47:03,512 --> 00:47:05,180
You got a light, Stumpy?

617
00:47:05,514 --> 00:47:08,684
Hey, in the jail! It's me, Colorado.

618
00:47:09,351 --> 00:47:10,519
Let him in.

619
00:47:13,188 --> 00:47:14,356
Come on in.

620
00:47:17,943 --> 00:47:20,445
I hear you got the man who shot Wheeler.

621
00:47:20,612 --> 00:47:21,864
Dude did.

622
00:47:23,532 --> 00:47:24,992
Thanks, Dude.

623
00:47:26,869 --> 00:47:28,787
Going to bury him in the morning.

624
00:47:28,871 --> 00:47:31,373
I've just been at the undertaker's with him.

625
00:47:31,456 --> 00:47:33,877
Here's the money and the papers
he had on him.

626
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:36,004
I took out $60 he owed me.

627
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:38,256
You got yours.

628
00:47:38,631 --> 00:47:40,133
How about the rest?

629
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:42,051
Did he owe them, too?

630
00:47:42,302 --> 00:47:43,553
Probably did.

631
00:47:44,137 --> 00:47:46,055
Didn't think about that.

632
00:47:46,389 --> 00:47:49,601
I can't turn anything over to you
till I get a court order.

633
00:47:49,726 --> 00:47:52,896
- Does that mean you hold the wagons, too?
- That's right.

634
00:47:52,979 --> 00:47:54,731
Meantime, I'm broke.

635
00:47:55,648 --> 00:47:58,776
If you or any of the rest are
short eating money...

636
00:47:59,068 --> 00:48:02,405
...l'll go good for it.
I'll tell them at the hotel.

637
00:48:02,739 --> 00:48:06,117
I wish you'd do that soon,
before anything happens to you.

638
00:48:06,492 --> 00:48:08,244
No offense again, Sheriff.

639
00:48:12,582 --> 00:48:15,169
It's nice to see a smart kid for a change.

640
00:48:15,419 --> 00:48:18,130
Yeah, he ain't like the usual kid with a gun.

641
00:48:19,423 --> 00:48:21,800
Wonder if he's as good as Wheeler said?

642
00:48:22,426 --> 00:48:23,928
I'd say he is.

643
00:48:24,929 --> 00:48:28,474
I'd say he's so good,
he doesn't feel he has to prove it.

644
00:48:37,691 --> 00:48:40,569
- Don't you ever sleep?
- I was beginning to think you didn't.

645
00:48:40,694 --> 00:48:42,029
I wanted to talk to you.

646
00:48:42,112 --> 00:48:45,449
Don't tell me
you're still looking for an apology.

647
00:48:46,367 --> 00:48:48,536
No, I was thinking of making one.

648
00:48:48,702 --> 00:48:50,704
I was pretty much of a...

649
00:48:51,121 --> 00:48:54,042
I got out of line tonight
and I'm not proud of it.

650
00:48:54,209 --> 00:48:56,044
My only excuse is...

651
00:48:56,461 --> 00:48:59,464
...I didn't know
about all the trouble you were in.

652
00:49:06,805 --> 00:49:09,391
I'm going to have a drink. How about you?

653
00:49:10,392 --> 00:49:12,727
Thanks, I'd like one.

654
00:49:14,896 --> 00:49:17,732
I'm sorry about Mr. Wheeler.

655
00:49:18,149 --> 00:49:20,610
Carlos told me he was a friend of yours.

656
00:49:20,986 --> 00:49:24,447
That's why he got shot.
Or did Carlos tell you that, too?

657
00:49:24,656 --> 00:49:26,032
Yes, he told me.

658
00:49:29,327 --> 00:49:31,538
How does a man get to be a sheriff?

659
00:49:32,247 --> 00:49:33,456
Gets lazy.

660
00:49:33,582 --> 00:49:35,001
Gets tired...

661
00:49:35,251 --> 00:49:37,086
...of selling his gun all over...

662
00:49:37,169 --> 00:49:39,172
...decides to sell it in one place.

663
00:49:39,338 --> 00:49:41,257
I'd say you made a poor sale.

664
00:49:41,507 --> 00:49:44,051
A lot of people around here
will agree with you.

665
00:49:44,177 --> 00:49:47,889
But it's still a sale
and it's too late to back out.

666
00:49:48,014 --> 00:49:52,185
Not to change the subject, but how does
a girl get herself on a handbill?

667
00:49:53,102 --> 00:49:54,687
She gets married.

668
00:49:55,521 --> 00:49:58,691
- Handbill says he was a cheat.
- He wasn't a cheat then.

669
00:49:59,192 --> 00:50:02,612
That came later after his luck turned.

670
00:50:03,779 --> 00:50:06,032
It was probably my fault he cheated.

671
00:50:06,199 --> 00:50:08,201
He liked to buy me things.

672
00:50:08,367 --> 00:50:11,120
- Then why did you leave him?
- I didn't.

673
00:50:11,787 --> 00:50:14,708
He left me rather suddenly.

674
00:50:15,959 --> 00:50:18,545
He was caught just like that man tonight...

675
00:50:19,546 --> 00:50:21,548
...only his luck had run out.

676
00:50:21,798 --> 00:50:23,175
He was shot.

677
00:50:24,384 --> 00:50:26,094
You've had a rough time.

678
00:50:28,138 --> 00:50:31,183
You're wrong, Sheriff.
I've had a good time.

679
00:50:31,808 --> 00:50:33,227
I liked gambling.

680
00:50:33,977 --> 00:50:37,022
We went everywhere,
had the best of everything.

681
00:50:38,315 --> 00:50:42,736
I didn't know that he was cheating
until they caught him.

682
00:50:44,738 --> 00:50:46,865
If I had known, it might have been rough.

683
00:50:46,990 --> 00:50:49,201
That's probably why he didn't tell me.

684
00:50:49,326 --> 00:50:50,869
When did this happen?

685
00:50:50,994 --> 00:50:53,121
About four months ago.

686
00:50:55,083 --> 00:50:58,294
Since then I've been working...

687
00:50:59,587 --> 00:51:02,006
...to get enough money for stage fare.

688
00:51:02,257 --> 00:51:03,800
You going home?

689
00:51:03,925 --> 00:51:05,426
I haven't any.

690
00:51:05,593 --> 00:51:06,845
Señor Chance!

691
00:51:06,928 --> 00:51:09,681
I didn't know you were here.
Why do you not tell me?

692
00:51:09,764 --> 00:51:13,184
You should be in bed.
Last night you slept just a little bit.

693
00:51:13,268 --> 00:51:16,187
But tonight, you will sleep well.
I will watch.

694
00:51:16,271 --> 00:51:18,523
No, Carlos, you stay out of it.

695
00:51:18,606 --> 00:51:20,942
I don't want anybody else helping me.

696
00:51:23,278 --> 00:51:24,863
This is my hotel...

697
00:51:25,113 --> 00:51:27,490
...and you are a guest under my roof.

698
00:51:27,782 --> 00:51:31,619
And I will not be told what I shall do
and what I shall not do.

699
00:51:33,121 --> 00:51:35,206
- All right, Carlos.
- What you do?

700
00:51:35,290 --> 00:51:36,584
I'll sleep in the jail.

701
00:51:36,709 --> 00:51:38,043
But you can't sleep...

702
00:51:38,127 --> 00:51:39,336
Bueno, señor.

703
00:51:39,461 --> 00:51:42,047
There's no need to watch.
I'm a light sleeper.

704
00:51:42,131 --> 00:51:44,967
I'll lock the door
and hook a chair under the knob.

705
00:51:45,134 --> 00:51:47,553
Anybody tries to get in, I'll hear them.

706
00:51:47,636 --> 00:51:49,221
- One thing.
- What?

707
00:51:49,305 --> 00:51:51,640
If I'm asleep at sunup, wake me.

708
00:51:52,391 --> 00:51:54,518
- But it's not enough.
- Will you?

709
00:51:54,643 --> 00:51:58,230
Bueno, señor. I say no more.
Have a good sleep.

710
00:51:58,314 --> 00:52:00,482
I don't want to meddle in your business.

711
00:52:00,566 --> 00:52:02,193
I'm going to turn in.

712
00:52:02,568 --> 00:52:04,904
If I don't see you in the morning, so long.

713
00:52:04,987 --> 00:52:06,071
So long.

714
00:52:06,405 --> 00:52:09,325
By the way, where are you going?

715
00:52:09,825 --> 00:52:12,494
Some place where
there aren't any handbills.

716
00:52:12,578 --> 00:52:16,625
That thing keeps popping up.
That's why I'm a little touchy about it.

717
00:52:18,335 --> 00:52:20,754
I know the sheriff that got these out.

718
00:52:21,922 --> 00:52:24,841
I'll write him a letter, get them called in.

719
00:52:25,842 --> 00:52:29,137
Then you won't have people like me
making trouble for you.

720
00:52:42,192 --> 00:52:43,360
Thanks.

721
00:53:24,068 --> 00:53:24,986
Carlos!

722
00:53:25,069 --> 00:53:26,153
Sí, señor.

723
00:53:26,237 --> 00:53:29,198
It's after 7:00.
Why didn't you wake me up?

724
00:53:29,323 --> 00:53:30,533
- The girl.
- The girl?

725
00:53:30,658 --> 00:53:33,536
- That one with the feathers.
- What's she got to do with it?

726
00:53:33,661 --> 00:53:35,246
She told me not to wake you.

727
00:53:35,329 --> 00:53:37,624
She was sitting outside your room
in a chair.

728
00:53:37,749 --> 00:53:39,710
Sitting outside my room in a chair?

729
00:53:39,835 --> 00:53:40,836
All night long.

730
00:53:40,919 --> 00:53:43,171
She was still there two, three minutes ago.

731
00:53:43,255 --> 00:53:46,842
Most likely she hear you get up.
She told me not to wake you.

732
00:53:46,925 --> 00:53:48,760
You can tell her...

733
00:53:49,595 --> 00:53:50,429
The fool!

734
00:53:50,512 --> 00:53:51,847
Tell her she's a fool?

735
00:53:51,930 --> 00:53:54,850
No! I'll tell her myself.

736
00:53:55,017 --> 00:53:56,727
You tell her she's a fool?

737
00:53:56,852 --> 00:53:58,395
I didn't say I was.

738
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:01,648
He say, "Not to wake him up."

739
00:54:01,773 --> 00:54:03,859
She say, "To wake him up."

740
00:54:03,942 --> 00:54:05,944
Me, I'm in the middle. Ay, Dios.

741
00:54:09,364 --> 00:54:10,199
Who is it?

742
00:54:10,282 --> 00:54:11,658
It's me. The sheriff.

743
00:54:11,783 --> 00:54:13,327
Just a minute.

744
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:21,628
Come on in.

745
00:54:25,965 --> 00:54:26,925
Hi.

746
00:54:27,634 --> 00:54:29,427
Did you get a good night's sleep?

747
00:54:29,552 --> 00:54:30,345
Who? Me?

748
00:54:30,470 --> 00:54:32,972
Yes, you. There's nobody else in the room.

749
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:35,642
Carlos had to go and talk.

750
00:54:36,726 --> 00:54:40,230
I couldn't sleep anyway.
I was just as well off out there in the hall.

751
00:54:40,313 --> 00:54:43,983
If anybody had come in, you'd have yelled
before they shot you. Is that it?

752
00:54:44,067 --> 00:54:44,943
Fool women.

753
00:54:45,068 --> 00:54:47,278
- Didn't you hear me say that...
- I know.

754
00:54:47,403 --> 00:54:50,532
You don't want anyone to help you.
I heard you tell Carlos.

755
00:54:50,657 --> 00:54:53,326
- Why did you do it?
- You weren't supposed to know.

756
00:54:53,409 --> 00:54:55,828
Why didn't you just go out
and not talk to Carlos?

757
00:54:55,912 --> 00:54:57,455
He didn't wake me up!

758
00:54:57,580 --> 00:55:00,084
Don't blame him, that was my fault.

759
00:55:00,334 --> 00:55:02,836
All right, nothing happened,
nobody got hurt.

760
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:05,256
You got some sleep, I lost some.

761
00:55:05,422 --> 00:55:08,592
Now I'm tired and you're mad
and I'm getting mad. So...

762
00:55:08,676 --> 00:55:10,219
...you'd better go on.

763
00:55:10,344 --> 00:55:12,221
I'm going to get some sleep, too.

764
00:55:12,346 --> 00:55:14,306
You can't go to bed now!

765
00:55:14,849 --> 00:55:16,016
I can't?

766
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:19,436
You just see whether or not
I can go to bed now or not.

767
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:21,564
You've got to get on that stagecoach.

768
00:55:21,689 --> 00:55:24,441
- What'd you say?
- The stage, it leaves in an hour.

769
00:55:24,525 --> 00:55:26,861
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I just did!

770
00:55:27,528 --> 00:55:31,699
Then you better get out then,
so I can get a bath and pack my things.

771
00:55:31,866 --> 00:55:33,951
I can't do it if you stand around talking.

772
00:55:34,034 --> 00:55:35,953
You're doing most of the talking.

773
00:55:36,036 --> 00:55:38,665
That's right. And I can't do that
and bathe and pack.

774
00:55:38,790 --> 00:55:40,792
- Will you just go on and go?
- I'm going.

775
00:55:40,876 --> 00:55:42,627
Then do it, don't talk any more.

776
00:55:42,711 --> 00:55:45,589
I'm doing enough
and neither of us are saying anything.

777
00:55:45,714 --> 00:55:48,300
So, just go on and let me get on the stage.

778
00:55:49,718 --> 00:55:51,386
Oh, hell! Goodbye.

779
00:55:52,053 --> 00:55:53,680
I just wanted to...

780
00:55:54,973 --> 00:55:57,350
You could have at least let me finish.

781
00:55:58,059 --> 00:56:01,897
You try to help someone
who doesn't want any help.

782
00:56:03,064 --> 00:56:05,025
I guess I talk too much.

783
00:56:07,235 --> 00:56:08,320
You tell her?

784
00:56:08,403 --> 00:56:10,697
- Tell her what?
- That she's a fool.

785
00:56:12,574 --> 00:56:13,867
She's going on the stage?

786
00:56:13,992 --> 00:56:16,369
She's going on the stage.
You make sure she does.

787
00:56:16,494 --> 00:56:18,915
You say she was going,
why should I make sure?

788
00:56:18,998 --> 00:56:21,334
Because I say for you
to make sure she does.

789
00:56:21,417 --> 00:56:22,752
I hold you responsible.

790
00:56:22,835 --> 00:56:24,212
Responsible, me?

791
00:56:24,337 --> 00:56:25,129
Yes.

792
00:56:28,591 --> 00:56:31,802
Dude, he's up the street.
He told me to tell you he's gone.

793
00:56:31,928 --> 00:56:33,137
So I see.

794
00:56:33,930 --> 00:56:36,891
There's a lot of people in town today.

795
00:56:37,433 --> 00:56:38,851
Did you hear why?

796
00:56:38,935 --> 00:56:43,523
A man say he hear maybe Nathan Burdette
will come to see you today.

797
00:56:43,689 --> 00:56:45,691
Most likely they here to watch.

798
00:56:46,442 --> 00:56:49,445
If he does, they may see something.

799
00:56:50,112 --> 00:56:51,531
I don't like it.

800
00:56:51,614 --> 00:56:52,865
Neither do I.

801
00:56:59,122 --> 00:57:02,376
Tom, hang your gun on the fence.
You'll pick it up when you leave.

802
00:57:02,459 --> 00:57:05,254
Sure enough.

803
00:57:30,821 --> 00:57:32,447
That's far enough.

804
00:57:32,656 --> 00:57:34,700
I got orders to take your guns.

805
00:57:35,409 --> 00:57:37,578
Suppose we don't want to give them up?

806
00:57:37,661 --> 00:57:40,456
Think you're good enough
to take them against six of us?

807
00:57:40,582 --> 00:57:43,668
For a smart man, Mr. Burdette,
that's pretty stupid.

808
00:57:44,252 --> 00:57:47,714
You won't need a gun no more
because you'd be the first man I'd get.

809
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:49,173
Come on, let's go.

810
00:57:49,257 --> 00:57:51,634
Harris, you're pretty good right there.

811
00:57:54,345 --> 00:57:55,722
Hold it, Harris!

812
00:57:55,847 --> 00:57:57,015
He cut my reins.

813
00:57:57,098 --> 00:58:00,643
I'd say he did it on purpose.
And I'm telling you to hold it.

814
00:58:05,106 --> 00:58:09,235
Now hang your guns on the fence
and you can pick them up when you leave.

815
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:10,820
Hang up your guns.

816
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:21,457
You're pretty good with that gun
when you're sober.

817
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:23,125
Not bad.

818
00:58:23,459 --> 00:58:24,793
How does that happen?

819
00:58:24,877 --> 00:58:28,339
If you mean being good with a gun,
I've had a lot of practice.

820
00:58:28,881 --> 00:58:30,966
If you mean being sober...

821
00:58:31,050 --> 00:58:34,011
...l'm getting practice on account
of your brother.

822
00:58:34,136 --> 00:58:35,387
I don't follow you.

823
00:58:35,471 --> 00:58:38,057
You don't have to follow me. Matt!

824
00:58:39,058 --> 00:58:41,477
Didn't you hear the boss say
that I was sober?

825
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:44,605
That extra gun in your vest,
lay that on the fence, too.

826
00:58:48,484 --> 00:58:51,904
- You're enjoying yourself, aren't you?
- All right, Mr. Burdette...

827
00:58:51,987 --> 00:58:54,740
...get going.
I got no more to talk to you about.

828
00:58:54,823 --> 00:58:56,700
You should enjoy it, Dude.

829
00:58:56,909 --> 00:59:00,705
Every man should have a little taste
of power before he's through.

830
00:59:21,017 --> 00:59:22,018
Stumpy!

831
00:59:22,769 --> 00:59:24,563
Burdette and his men are coming in.

832
00:59:24,688 --> 00:59:27,274
Don't put down no red carpet for them.

833
00:59:27,357 --> 00:59:29,734
And I'm staying right
where I'm supposed to.

834
00:59:29,860 --> 00:59:31,236
You do that.

835
00:59:34,447 --> 00:59:36,116
Good morning, Sheriff.

836
00:59:36,616 --> 00:59:37,951
Hello, Burdette.

837
00:59:38,702 --> 00:59:40,412
Been expecting you.

838
00:59:40,871 --> 00:59:42,540
I want to see my brother.

839
00:59:42,623 --> 00:59:44,041
You can come in.

840
00:59:44,959 --> 00:59:48,963
But that doesn't mean the rest of you.
He's not your brother.

841
00:59:49,130 --> 00:59:51,340
Go on across the street with the others.

842
00:59:51,465 --> 00:59:52,925
Do as he says.

843
00:59:54,302 --> 00:59:56,679
What are all those people doing in town?

844
00:59:56,971 --> 00:59:58,389
I didn't ask.

845
00:59:58,973 --> 01:00:02,226
Didn't ask them to come,
or ask them why they're here.

846
01:00:03,311 --> 01:00:06,480
But I think they're watching to see
what you're going to do.

847
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:12,486
You don't like that, do you?
Too many witnesses.

848
01:00:13,321 --> 01:00:16,574
Now do you want to keep talking to me
or see your brother?

849
01:00:17,408 --> 01:00:18,951
See my brother.

850
01:00:21,413 --> 01:00:23,123
We're coming in, Stumpy.

851
01:00:23,498 --> 01:00:26,668
Come ahead.
Don't wait for me to carry you.

852
01:00:34,259 --> 01:00:36,345
All right, Stumpy, open up.

853
01:00:37,179 --> 01:00:38,680
What's the password?

854
01:00:38,764 --> 01:00:39,806
Come on.

855
01:00:39,932 --> 01:00:42,643
I'm coming. I wouldn't miss this.

856
01:00:42,768 --> 01:00:46,605
Just want him to see how we're set up.
Look who's here.

857
01:00:46,855 --> 01:00:49,274
Place's getting all cluttered up
with Burdettes.

858
01:00:49,358 --> 01:00:50,901
Come right in, Mr. Burdette.

859
01:00:51,026 --> 01:00:54,530
That fellow round the corner
with a banged-up face is your brother.

860
01:00:54,613 --> 01:00:55,822
Nathan.

861
01:00:56,615 --> 01:00:57,658
Joe.

862
01:00:58,867 --> 01:01:01,078
Looks like they gave you a going over.

863
01:01:01,203 --> 01:01:02,747
Our friend here.

864
01:01:04,207 --> 01:01:05,083
Why?

865
01:01:05,458 --> 01:01:08,753
He didn't take too kindly
to being arrested for murder.

866
01:01:08,962 --> 01:01:10,547
It wasn't murder.

867
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:13,633
If he says it wasn't murder,
why do you say it was?

868
01:01:13,716 --> 01:01:17,804
Man gets shot that's got a gun,
there's room for reasonable doubt.

869
01:01:18,888 --> 01:01:22,141
Man gets shot that hasn't got a gun,
what would you call it?

870
01:01:22,892 --> 01:01:27,564
You knew that already, otherwise you
wouldn't have set things up like you did.

871
01:01:27,814 --> 01:01:29,274
Just what have I done?

872
01:01:29,399 --> 01:01:31,067
You're a rich man, Burdette.

873
01:01:31,150 --> 01:01:32,402
Big ranch.

874
01:01:32,569 --> 01:01:35,363
Pay a lot of people to do
what you want them to do.

875
01:01:35,905 --> 01:01:37,657
And you got a brother.

876
01:01:37,740 --> 01:01:40,243
He's no good, but he's your brother.

877
01:01:40,910 --> 01:01:44,540
If he committed 20 murders,
you'd try and see he didn't hang for them.

878
01:01:44,665 --> 01:01:46,292
I don't like that kind of talk.

879
01:01:46,417 --> 01:01:48,711
- You're accusing me...
- Let's get this straight.

880
01:01:48,836 --> 01:01:50,379
You don't like it.

881
01:01:50,504 --> 01:01:52,464
I don't like a lot of things.

882
01:01:52,590 --> 01:01:56,302
I don't like your men sitting on the road
bottling up this town.

883
01:01:56,427 --> 01:02:00,639
I don't like your men watching us,
trying to catch us with our backs turned.

884
01:02:00,764 --> 01:02:03,601
And I don't like it
when a friend of mine offers to help...

885
01:02:03,684 --> 01:02:05,853
...and 20 minutes later he's dead!

886
01:02:06,604 --> 01:02:09,773
And I don't like you, Burdette,
because you set it up.

887
01:02:12,610 --> 01:02:14,778
What're you going to do about it?

888
01:02:15,863 --> 01:02:18,073
I thought you'd get around to that.

889
01:02:18,699 --> 01:02:21,202
I'm going to sit here
with your brother in my lap...

890
01:02:21,285 --> 01:02:24,122
...until the United States Marshal
gets here.

891
01:02:24,289 --> 01:02:26,291
That'll be about six days.

892
01:02:26,625 --> 01:02:29,794
He may ask a few questions
about that busted wheel.

893
01:02:30,462 --> 01:02:33,715
But I think you're too smart
to have stopped that stage completely.

894
01:02:33,798 --> 01:02:35,467
Now I'm running out of breath.

895
01:02:35,550 --> 01:02:37,510
You talk if you want to.

896
01:02:38,220 --> 01:02:41,139
He talks awful big for a man
that's all alone...

897
01:02:41,306 --> 01:02:43,642
...except for a barfly and a cripple.

898
01:02:44,976 --> 01:02:47,812
- You can get me out of here any...
- Shut up, Joe!

899
01:02:48,230 --> 01:02:51,024
You're not as smart as your brother, Joe.

900
01:02:51,650 --> 01:02:55,654
He sees Stumpy here sitting
around the corner locked in with you.

901
01:02:56,488 --> 01:02:59,282
And if that isn't plain enough,
I'll tell you why.

902
01:02:59,407 --> 01:03:01,993
If any trouble starts around this jail...

903
01:03:02,077 --> 01:03:06,082
...before anybody can get to you,
you're going to get accidentally shot.

904
01:03:06,666 --> 01:03:08,960
I can practical guarantee that.

905
01:03:10,253 --> 01:03:13,172
I see you still have
a little grudge against us.

906
01:03:14,590 --> 01:03:17,969
460 acres might be little to you, Nathan.

907
01:03:18,594 --> 01:03:20,388
But it was a lot of country to me.

908
01:03:20,513 --> 01:03:24,475
Don't take no chances, Nathan.
He looks just crazy enough to shoot me.

909
01:03:24,850 --> 01:03:26,769
He's smarter than I thought.

910
01:03:27,854 --> 01:03:30,898
You know,
a court might just call that murder, too.

911
01:03:31,357 --> 01:03:32,984
What's the difference?

912
01:03:33,109 --> 01:03:35,111
We'd all be dead by then.

913
01:03:35,361 --> 01:03:37,738
You got anything else you want to say?

914
01:03:38,197 --> 01:03:41,534
Just one thing. Joe has friends.

915
01:03:42,368 --> 01:03:44,746
You can't hold Joe
or me responsible for them...

916
01:03:44,872 --> 01:03:47,708
...what you say they've done
or what they might do.

917
01:03:48,208 --> 01:03:49,751
I want to make that clear.

918
01:03:49,877 --> 01:03:51,670
I'll help you make it clear.

919
01:03:51,795 --> 01:03:54,464
I don't think Joe's got a friend in the world.

920
01:03:54,548 --> 01:03:58,802
And he won't have any unless somebody
buys them for him at $50 a head.

921
01:03:59,219 --> 01:04:01,638
Like the fellow that shot Wheeler.

922
01:04:03,307 --> 01:04:04,933
You made it clear.

923
01:04:05,309 --> 01:04:06,727
All right, Stumpy.

924
01:04:06,810 --> 01:04:08,729
- Nathan.
- Just sit tight, Joe.

925
01:04:08,812 --> 01:04:10,814
Send me a bottle before you leave town.

926
01:04:10,898 --> 01:04:14,526
You do that, because part of my job
is to see that it ain't poisoned.

927
01:04:14,651 --> 01:04:17,446
Sometimes takes quite a spell to find out.

928
01:04:22,326 --> 01:04:24,579
- He didn't have much to say, did he?
- No.

929
01:04:30,001 --> 01:04:33,379
What did you leave him go for?
You had plenty to hold him on.

930
01:04:33,504 --> 01:04:35,131
Anything they're going to do is...

931
01:04:35,256 --> 01:04:37,717
...planned already,
or he wouldn't have come in here.

932
01:04:37,842 --> 01:04:41,221
Throwing him with Joe would give him
an alibi for whatever happens.

933
01:04:41,346 --> 01:04:42,680
I never thought of that.

934
01:04:42,764 --> 01:04:45,099
- What do you think will happen?
- I don't know.

935
01:04:45,183 --> 01:04:46,935
You can think, can't you? Any man...

936
01:04:47,435 --> 01:04:51,356
I think I told you to get back in there
and stay with that door locked.

937
01:04:51,439 --> 01:04:54,025
Be careful how you talk to me.
You hear what Joe said.

938
01:04:54,108 --> 01:04:57,445
You're alone except for a barfly
and an old cripple.

939
01:04:57,612 --> 01:05:01,616
Calling me an old cripple.
I like hearing you say that, Joe.

940
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:04,745
I got to fix your supper for you tonight.

941
01:05:09,959 --> 01:05:11,043
Señor Chance.

942
01:05:11,126 --> 01:05:12,628
It's me, Carlos.

943
01:05:12,711 --> 01:05:14,088
Come on in.

944
01:05:14,630 --> 01:05:15,673
What do you want?

945
01:05:15,798 --> 01:05:17,091
I want to talk to you.

946
01:05:17,216 --> 01:05:18,634
Did the girl...

947
01:05:19,635 --> 01:05:21,262
What happened to your eye?

948
01:05:21,387 --> 01:05:23,514
You told me to put the lady on the stage.

949
01:05:23,639 --> 01:05:25,474
She did that? What'd you do?

950
01:05:25,558 --> 01:05:28,102
- She did not do it.
- I thought you said she did.

951
01:05:28,227 --> 01:05:32,231
I say you tell me to put her on the stage.
Consuelo, she hit me in the eye.

952
01:05:32,314 --> 01:05:35,234
- I'm a little mixed up.
- Do not talk. I tell you.

953
01:05:35,317 --> 01:05:37,111
- Okay.
- It's better if I tell you.

954
01:05:37,236 --> 01:05:41,156
You told me to put her on the stage.
The stage she's ready, but she don't come.

955
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:43,659
I yell at her, "Come down."
She said, "No."

956
01:05:43,742 --> 01:05:46,413
- I go and get her, she said she don't go.
- Did she go?

957
01:05:46,496 --> 01:05:49,207
I tell her you say go.
I tell her I am responsible.

958
01:05:49,332 --> 01:05:52,294
She say, no, she is responsible.
And I said that may be.

959
01:05:52,419 --> 01:05:55,881
I pick her up. And Consuelo say,
"What are you doing with that woman?"

960
01:05:56,006 --> 01:05:59,426
I say, "I take her to the stage."
The woman said she don't want to go.

961
01:05:59,509 --> 01:06:01,052
Did she go on the stage?

962
01:06:01,177 --> 01:06:04,598
Consuelo tell me put her down.
I said, "I am responsible."

963
01:06:04,681 --> 01:06:07,809
Consuelo thinks that mean something else.
So she give me this eye.

964
01:06:07,934 --> 01:06:09,019
What'd you do?

965
01:06:09,102 --> 01:06:11,938
Do? What can I do?
My arms is full of the lady.

966
01:06:12,022 --> 01:06:16,401
I can do nothing. I drop her on the floor.
She yells. And she says I tried to kill her.

967
01:06:16,526 --> 01:06:18,069
Did the girl get on the stage?

968
01:06:18,195 --> 01:06:20,864
No, she did not go!
But Jake says he couldn't wait.

969
01:06:20,947 --> 01:06:22,657
- Why?
- He says he must leave.

970
01:06:22,782 --> 01:06:25,327
I mean the girl.
Did she say why she wasn't going?

971
01:06:25,452 --> 01:06:28,456
No. She didn't say.
How can I know if she don't say?

972
01:06:28,539 --> 01:06:32,293
Please come and tell Consuelo
what responsible means.

973
01:06:32,376 --> 01:06:34,003
Stumpy, we're going out.

974
01:06:34,128 --> 01:06:37,298
Fine. I like to be left alone.
I'm getting used to it.

975
01:06:45,890 --> 01:06:47,391
The door's unlocked.

976
01:06:54,232 --> 01:06:55,733
I didn't go.

977
01:06:56,234 --> 01:06:57,735
I can see that.

978
01:06:59,737 --> 01:07:01,280
I don't know...

979
01:07:01,822 --> 01:07:05,409
...I had everything all packed,
then Carlos yelled the stage was ready...

980
01:07:05,493 --> 01:07:08,455
...and I heard somebody saying
they weren't going.

981
01:07:09,498 --> 01:07:11,250
It was me saying it.

982
01:07:11,583 --> 01:07:14,878
And you want to know why I didn't go,
don't you, Sheriff?

983
01:07:16,838 --> 01:07:19,633
What's your name, anyway?
I don't even know that.

984
01:07:19,758 --> 01:07:21,593
Chance, John T.

985
01:07:21,927 --> 01:07:23,387
"T" for trouble.

986
01:07:24,179 --> 01:07:26,890
I always make you mad, don't I, John T.?

987
01:07:28,433 --> 01:07:30,978
Then, don't make me tell you why I stayed.

988
01:07:33,438 --> 01:07:35,274
I won't make it any harder for you.

989
01:07:35,357 --> 01:07:38,110
I won't get in your way. I'll just be here.

990
01:07:39,278 --> 01:07:41,029
You don't owe me a thing.

991
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:43,740
And you won't owe me when it's all over.

992
01:07:44,449 --> 01:07:47,412
When that happens,
just tell me to go, and I'll go.

993
01:07:49,622 --> 01:07:52,083
No, you won't even have to tell me.

994
01:07:52,792 --> 01:07:55,086
I'll know by then, and I'll just go.

995
01:07:56,212 --> 01:07:58,089
Is that fair, John T.?

996
01:08:02,969 --> 01:08:06,055
You don't have to answer me now
if you don't want to.

997
01:08:07,640 --> 01:08:11,185
But just say something.

998
01:08:12,478 --> 01:08:16,566
If I weren't in this mess,
it might be different.

999
01:08:17,567 --> 01:08:18,943
But I am.

1000
01:08:20,320 --> 01:08:22,280
That's all I wanted to hear.

1001
01:08:42,843 --> 01:08:45,054
I'm glad we tried it a second time.

1002
01:08:45,930 --> 01:08:48,098
It's better when two people do it.

1003
01:08:50,601 --> 01:08:52,686
I've kept you long enough.

1004
01:08:53,187 --> 01:08:55,731
You'd better run along now
and do your job.

1005
01:10:58,148 --> 01:10:59,358
Hi, Chance.

1006
01:10:59,483 --> 01:11:03,487
It's getting too dark to do any good
out there. I'd just be a sitting duck.

1007
01:11:03,987 --> 01:11:06,073
Anything happen when Burdette left?

1008
01:11:06,156 --> 01:11:07,908
Nice as pie. Didn't say a word.

1009
01:11:07,991 --> 01:11:09,827
What was the shot when they came in?

1010
01:11:09,911 --> 01:11:12,205
That gunslinger of his was on the prod.

1011
01:11:12,330 --> 01:11:13,248
What'd he do?

1012
01:11:13,331 --> 01:11:16,334
Nothing, just grunted and growled,
made a few faces.

1013
01:11:16,709 --> 01:11:18,836
Took care of that. What happened here?

1014
01:11:18,920 --> 01:11:20,171
Not much.

1015
01:11:22,090 --> 01:11:24,801
That tune, they been playing it all day.

1016
01:11:25,009 --> 01:11:26,344
What is it?

1017
01:11:26,678 --> 01:11:29,764
It's some Mexican piece.
I heard it farther south.

1018
01:11:31,432 --> 01:11:33,017
Good evening, Sheriff.

1019
01:11:33,184 --> 01:11:35,228
Colorado. What do you want?

1020
01:11:35,687 --> 01:11:37,272
Just curious again.

1021
01:11:37,355 --> 01:11:39,399
How'd you come out with Burdette?

1022
01:11:39,524 --> 01:11:41,442
He wanted to talk to his brother.

1023
01:11:41,526 --> 01:11:43,862
- What'd he have to say?
- Nothing.

1024
01:11:44,112 --> 01:11:45,780
You mean he didn't say anything?

1025
01:11:45,864 --> 01:11:47,615
Why are you so interested?

1026
01:11:47,699 --> 01:11:49,743
Because he's talking now.

1027
01:11:50,035 --> 01:11:51,537
Hear that music?

1028
01:11:51,704 --> 01:11:53,455
He told the man to play it.

1029
01:11:54,707 --> 01:11:55,833
What is it?

1030
01:11:56,041 --> 01:11:58,961
They call it The Deguello,
the cutthroat song.

1031
01:11:59,044 --> 01:12:03,632
The Mexicans played it for the Texas boys
when they had them pent up at the Alamo.

1032
01:12:03,716 --> 01:12:06,427
Played it day and night till it was all over.

1033
01:12:06,886 --> 01:12:09,054
Now do you know what he means by it?

1034
01:12:09,138 --> 01:12:10,514
No quarter.

1035
01:12:11,348 --> 01:12:13,142
No mercy for the losers.

1036
01:12:13,225 --> 01:12:14,894
You'll be hearing a lot of it.

1037
01:12:15,019 --> 01:12:17,521
I guess we made him talk after all.

1038
01:12:17,688 --> 01:12:20,274
Just thought you'd like to know, Sheriff.

1039
01:13:19,544 --> 01:13:20,503
Stumpy!

1040
01:13:20,795 --> 01:13:23,714
- What?
- They don't need any help with that tune.

1041
01:13:23,839 --> 01:13:26,676
What's the matter,
is it getting through to you?

1042
01:13:33,766 --> 01:13:36,477
By the way, the stage got off all right.

1043
01:13:38,437 --> 01:13:40,815
I watched it clear through the valley.

1044
01:13:42,483 --> 01:13:45,444
In about six days the marshal will get here.

1045
01:13:45,653 --> 01:13:47,238
That's what I figured.

1046
01:13:50,993 --> 01:13:53,161
The girl wasn't on the stage.

1047
01:13:55,664 --> 01:13:56,999
I know that.

1048
01:13:59,334 --> 01:14:01,003
Tell her she could stay?

1049
01:14:01,378 --> 01:14:02,546
No, she...

1050
01:14:04,256 --> 01:14:06,425
Yes, I did. What about it?

1051
01:14:06,633 --> 01:14:08,302
Nothing, nothing at all.

1052
01:14:08,510 --> 01:14:10,178
You were going to say something.

1053
01:14:10,262 --> 01:14:12,055
I remembered in time.

1054
01:14:13,432 --> 01:14:17,603
I remembered another girl came through
on a stage that stopped over.

1055
01:14:18,854 --> 01:14:21,315
I remember you told me she was no good.

1056
01:14:22,107 --> 01:14:24,610
I didn't believe you, but you were right.

1057
01:14:24,776 --> 01:14:27,070
So, naturally I figured you're an expert.

1058
01:14:27,195 --> 01:14:30,073
And you know just
what you're doing all the time.

1059
01:14:31,201 --> 01:14:33,912
I just hope you have better luck than I had.

1060
01:14:36,372 --> 01:14:40,043
You know, that's the first time
I've been able to laugh about that.

1061
01:14:40,210 --> 01:14:41,961
Maybe there's some hope for me yet.

1062
01:14:42,086 --> 01:14:42,837
Maybe.

1063
01:14:43,463 --> 01:14:44,547
But I doubt it.

1064
01:14:44,672 --> 01:14:48,259
That's what I like about you,
you're such an encouraging man.

1065
01:14:49,135 --> 01:14:52,472
If you go by the hotel,
pick up some coffee and sugar, will you?

1066
01:14:52,555 --> 01:14:53,848
Joe complaining?

1067
01:14:53,973 --> 01:14:55,683
Him? He didn't get no sugar.

1068
01:14:55,808 --> 01:14:58,228
His coffee's water poured
over the old grounds.

1069
01:14:58,311 --> 01:15:00,355
I'll learn him to talk out of turn.

1070
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:04,692
Before I forget, your gun's a little stiff.
You mind if I file the action a bit?

1071
01:15:04,817 --> 01:15:07,070
I don't want you to file no action
on my gun.

1072
01:15:07,153 --> 01:15:10,949
I don't want no easy pull. I might
shoot myself. Get somebody else's.

1073
01:15:11,282 --> 01:15:13,536
Why don't you give him his own guns?

1074
01:15:14,411 --> 01:15:17,498
- I forgot all about them.
- Your memory is no better than mine.

1075
01:15:17,581 --> 01:15:20,084
They been locked up over a year
except when you...

1076
01:15:20,167 --> 01:15:22,795
...took them out
to clean them and oil them.

1077
01:15:30,553 --> 01:15:32,263
Where'd you get these?

1078
01:15:32,763 --> 01:15:35,516
Bought them off the fellow
you sold them to.

1079
01:15:41,772 --> 01:15:43,566
I don't know how to...

1080
01:15:44,275 --> 01:15:48,070
Let's take a turn around the town.
Get Stumpy his coffee.

1081
01:15:48,195 --> 01:15:50,531
Ain't you going to tell me
to get back in there?

1082
01:15:50,614 --> 01:15:53,368
No, stay out here and get shot.

1083
01:15:53,785 --> 01:15:55,871
I might do that just for spite.

1084
01:15:56,121 --> 01:15:58,039
Might get a laugh out of you.

1085
01:15:58,748 --> 01:16:01,126
What I put up with for $30 a month.

1086
01:16:20,562 --> 01:16:21,855
Feels good.

1087
01:16:21,980 --> 01:16:23,064
Come on.

1088
01:16:23,481 --> 01:16:25,650
By the way, am I drawing pay?

1089
01:16:26,067 --> 01:16:27,360
Same as before.

1090
01:16:27,444 --> 01:16:30,155
In that case take out
what you gave for these guns.

1091
01:16:30,238 --> 01:16:31,489
No hurry.

1092
01:16:32,032 --> 01:16:34,744
If you're feeling so generous,
I could use an advance.

1093
01:16:34,827 --> 01:16:38,706
Buy a new pair of pants, new shirt.
Something without all these holes in it.

1094
01:16:38,831 --> 01:16:39,916
No need of that.

1095
01:16:39,999 --> 01:16:42,960
When you lit out,
you left some things behind.

1096
01:16:43,669 --> 01:16:45,588
I got them at the hotel.

1097
01:16:46,339 --> 01:16:48,591
You been keeping them all this time?

1098
01:16:49,425 --> 01:16:51,719
Been waiting till they fit you again.

1099
01:16:54,096 --> 01:16:57,183
You could use a bath and a shave, too.

1100
01:16:57,600 --> 01:17:01,145
I don't know about the shave.
I'm liable to cut my own throat.

1101
01:17:02,897 --> 01:17:04,023
Chance?

1102
01:17:04,398 --> 01:17:05,483
Yeah?

1103
01:17:05,775 --> 01:17:06,984
They'll fit.

1104
01:17:07,693 --> 01:17:08,778
Thanks.

1105
01:17:40,561 --> 01:17:41,812
There you are.

1106
01:17:48,485 --> 01:17:50,404
How about you, John T.?

1107
01:17:50,737 --> 01:17:52,364
Shall I work on you?

1108
01:17:52,573 --> 01:17:54,325
I do my own shaving.

1109
01:17:55,076 --> 01:17:56,536
I thought you did.

1110
01:17:56,828 --> 01:17:58,830
I was just reminding you.

1111
01:18:05,753 --> 01:18:07,964
Sure buy a lot of drinks with that.

1112
01:18:10,425 --> 01:18:11,759
You sure could.

1113
01:18:14,804 --> 01:18:16,681
I'll let you keep it for me.

1114
01:18:18,474 --> 01:18:21,978
Feathers, thanks for the shave.
Might call on you again.

1115
01:18:22,103 --> 01:18:24,063
Anytime, because I'll be here.

1116
01:18:24,230 --> 01:18:27,358
I didn't tell you, John T.,
Carlos is giving me a job.

1117
01:18:27,525 --> 01:18:30,820
Good for Carlos. Shall we take Stumpy
his coffee and things?

1118
01:18:30,945 --> 01:18:33,823
You in a hurry, John T.?
I'd like to talk to you.

1119
01:18:33,949 --> 01:18:36,619
- I'll wait for you.
- Thanks, Dude.

1120
01:18:37,244 --> 01:18:39,788
- I just wanted to ask you...
- What's this about a job?

1121
01:18:39,872 --> 01:18:43,792
Carlos says he's not sleeping very well.
Says I can help out downstairs.

1122
01:18:44,376 --> 01:18:45,794
Tending bar?

1123
01:18:45,878 --> 01:18:47,630
Among other things.

1124
01:18:48,797 --> 01:18:50,424
You think I shouldn't?

1125
01:18:50,633 --> 01:18:51,675
Why ask me?

1126
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:53,844
The way you said "tending bar."

1127
01:18:54,136 --> 01:18:56,555
- All right, I won't do it.
- I didn't say not to.

1128
01:18:56,722 --> 01:18:58,182
You don't like the idea.

1129
01:18:58,307 --> 01:19:00,893
Why should it be up to me?
Why should I care?

1130
01:19:00,976 --> 01:19:03,062
I don't know why you get mad
when I ask you.

1131
01:19:03,229 --> 01:19:04,897
- I'm not mad.
- You're not?

1132
01:19:04,980 --> 01:19:07,900
- You'd make anybody mad.
- I suppose I would.

1133
01:19:09,235 --> 01:19:12,696
As long as you haven't anything against it,
I'll take the job.

1134
01:19:12,905 --> 01:19:13,906
Go ahead.

1135
01:19:14,073 --> 01:19:15,575
Thanks, I will.

1136
01:19:17,369 --> 01:19:18,870
What were you going to ask me?

1137
01:19:18,954 --> 01:19:22,374
- Never mind. You're in too bad a humor.
- What were you going to ask?

1138
01:19:22,499 --> 01:19:25,001
Whether you were going to sleep
in the hotel tonight.

1139
01:19:25,126 --> 01:19:28,922
Get one thing straight. There'll be no more
chair-sitting outside this door.

1140
01:19:29,005 --> 01:19:30,882
I know. I've given that up.

1141
01:19:30,966 --> 01:19:34,803
Anyway, I have a better idea.
Tonight you sleep in my room.

1142
01:19:34,928 --> 01:19:36,888
Anyone looking wouldn't look there first.

1143
01:19:37,013 --> 01:19:39,683
You'd have more time
if anything did happen.

1144
01:19:40,267 --> 01:19:43,687
Besides, I have a rocking chair,
it's more comfortable.

1145
01:19:44,854 --> 01:19:47,482
Just an idea. You can think about it.

1146
01:19:48,358 --> 01:19:50,777
When you're in a little better humor.

1147
01:20:00,872 --> 01:20:02,582
Chance!

1148
01:20:02,790 --> 01:20:04,709
The shot came from the jail.

1149
01:20:15,761 --> 01:20:16,888
Chance, look out!

1150
01:20:16,971 --> 01:20:18,556
Don't go in there.

1151
01:20:18,723 --> 01:20:20,850
That idiot just took a shot at me.

1152
01:20:21,726 --> 01:20:23,561
Stumpy! You all right?

1153
01:20:24,228 --> 01:20:28,024
Sure I am, but there's a feller out there
with a black hat that ain't.

1154
01:20:28,149 --> 01:20:29,650
And I'm that fellow.

1155
01:20:32,236 --> 01:20:33,571
Coming in.

1156
01:20:35,031 --> 01:20:36,950
Look what he did to my hat.

1157
01:20:39,661 --> 01:20:41,496
Stumpy, that was Dude you shot at.

1158
01:20:41,580 --> 01:20:44,917
Dude? I didn't know.
Didn't look like Dude.

1159
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:46,668
Fool almost blowed my head off.

1160
01:20:46,752 --> 01:20:48,128
How'd I know it was you?

1161
01:20:48,253 --> 01:20:50,589
You get yourself dolled up
like Astor's pet horse...

1162
01:20:50,672 --> 01:20:54,009
...and then stick your nose in that door
and don't say nothing.

1163
01:20:54,092 --> 01:20:55,177
Look at this hat.

1164
01:20:55,260 --> 01:20:58,222
If you hadn't ducked,
that's what your head would look like.

1165
01:20:58,347 --> 01:21:00,474
I never would have fired
if I knew it was you.

1166
01:21:00,599 --> 01:21:03,143
Okay, I know, just stop talking, will you?

1167
01:21:03,268 --> 01:21:05,854
The shot didn't bother me.
I've been shot at before.

1168
01:21:05,938 --> 01:21:07,356
You could have hollered.

1169
01:21:07,439 --> 01:21:10,692
Just 'cause you get cleaned up
don't mean you can't talk.

1170
01:21:10,776 --> 01:21:14,196
It's my fault. I should have yelled.
I shouldn't have taken a bath.

1171
01:21:14,279 --> 01:21:16,616
Just stop talking. Just let it be.

1172
01:21:16,783 --> 01:21:20,245
You been going around for years
like something the cat dragged in...

1173
01:21:20,370 --> 01:21:22,872
...and now you expect...
- Shut up!

1174
01:21:25,083 --> 01:21:28,002
I told you, Stumpy, I've had it.

1175
01:21:29,128 --> 01:21:31,047
Don't let me tell you again.

1176
01:21:47,647 --> 01:21:50,233
You're getting a little touchy, aren't you?

1177
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:53,611
I've been listening to
that old fool talk until I'm...

1178
01:21:54,904 --> 01:21:56,407
All right, I'm wrong.

1179
01:21:56,490 --> 01:21:59,451
That old fool is talking
because he nearly killed you.

1180
01:21:59,535 --> 01:22:01,662
He's the one that's scared.

1181
01:22:02,913 --> 01:22:05,165
We've been pampering you too much.

1182
01:22:05,916 --> 01:22:07,918
You better get some sleep.

1183
01:22:17,011 --> 01:22:20,681
You know, he acts like I done it
on purpose. And I didn't.

1184
01:22:20,890 --> 01:22:22,600
You see that door there?

1185
01:22:23,017 --> 01:22:25,269
That look like I done it on purpose?

1186
01:22:25,853 --> 01:22:27,980
It's going to get cold here at night.

1187
01:22:28,105 --> 01:22:32,359
And I'm going to leave it get cold.
Because I ain't going to fix that door.

1188
01:22:34,612 --> 01:22:36,363
It weren't my fault.

1189
01:22:38,199 --> 01:22:39,284
Were it?

1190
01:22:45,290 --> 01:22:46,333
I know.

1191
01:22:48,877 --> 01:22:50,295
I'll fix the door.

1192
01:23:04,976 --> 01:23:06,561
Hi, Sheriff.

1193
01:23:17,240 --> 01:23:19,200
How do you like your new job?

1194
01:23:19,408 --> 01:23:21,786
They've been keeping me pretty busy.

1195
01:23:23,246 --> 01:23:25,831
You through for the day? Going to bed?

1196
01:23:25,915 --> 01:23:27,291
I thought I would.

1197
01:23:27,416 --> 01:23:29,627
- Can I make you some coffee?
- No thanks.

1198
01:23:29,710 --> 01:23:31,295
- Anything to eat?
- Nope.

1199
01:23:31,420 --> 01:23:32,838
How about a drink?

1200
01:23:34,090 --> 01:23:35,758
I'll take a drink.

1201
01:23:36,842 --> 01:23:39,554
Carlos says this is for special guests.

1202
01:23:40,763 --> 01:23:42,598
Tired, aren't you, John T.?

1203
01:23:44,016 --> 01:23:45,851
I can fix you a nice hot bath.

1204
01:23:45,935 --> 01:23:47,770
All I want is that drink.

1205
01:23:48,771 --> 01:23:51,774
Then, this is all I can do for you?

1206
01:23:54,360 --> 01:23:56,529
I thought you said I could think about it.

1207
01:23:56,612 --> 01:23:59,074
You're right. I did.

1208
01:24:00,450 --> 01:24:02,119
Put it on the tab.

1209
01:24:02,869 --> 01:24:05,872
In case you make up your mind,
I left my door open.

1210
01:24:09,543 --> 01:24:11,545
Get a good night's sleep.

1211
01:24:11,628 --> 01:24:13,630
You're not helping me any.

1212
01:26:12,419 --> 01:26:13,962
Good morning, Dude.

1213
01:26:14,254 --> 01:26:15,463
Good morning.

1214
01:26:15,547 --> 01:26:17,048
Have a good night?

1215
01:26:17,591 --> 01:26:18,800
All right, I guess.

1216
01:26:18,925 --> 01:26:20,260
Eat anything?

1217
01:26:21,094 --> 01:26:22,512
This morning?

1218
01:26:23,096 --> 01:26:24,431
Stumpy fixed something.

1219
01:26:24,514 --> 01:26:27,434
I asked you a question.
You didn't answer it.

1220
01:26:27,684 --> 01:26:30,353
All right, I'll answer you.
I didn't sleep good...

1221
01:26:30,437 --> 01:26:33,523
...didn't eat anything.
I had a beer and it didn't do any good.

1222
01:26:33,607 --> 01:26:35,275
Think you can stand your watch?

1223
01:26:35,358 --> 01:26:37,777
When I can't do that I'll let you know.

1224
01:27:39,508 --> 01:27:41,301
- That's enough.
- Yeah.

1225
01:27:41,510 --> 01:27:43,095
Where's his hat?

1226
01:27:49,601 --> 01:27:52,854
Get out there.
We'll be along as soon as we get him tied.

1227
01:28:04,450 --> 01:28:07,495
Stumpy, did Dude have a bad night?

1228
01:28:07,870 --> 01:28:09,956
He's suffering "thunderation," Chance.

1229
01:28:10,039 --> 01:28:14,502
His mind's just beginning to work again,
and he sees what he done to himself.

1230
01:28:15,211 --> 01:28:16,713
Ain't pretty.

1231
01:28:17,297 --> 01:28:19,048
He's got to sweat it out.

1232
01:28:19,883 --> 01:28:22,302
And don't let him cry
on your shoulder either.

1233
01:28:22,385 --> 01:28:23,636
He ain't done it yet.

1234
01:28:23,761 --> 01:28:26,556
Why are you so god darned ornery?
Always picking on Dude.

1235
01:28:26,639 --> 01:28:29,893
- You got any tobacco?
- No, I give the last there was to Dude.

1236
01:28:30,018 --> 01:28:32,604
He uses it up fast.
You got to get some for yourself.

1237
01:28:32,729 --> 01:28:35,481
But what I'm asking you
is why are you picking on Dude?

1238
01:28:35,565 --> 01:28:39,485
All right, be nice to him
and he'll fall apart in small pieces.

1239
01:28:39,736 --> 01:28:42,239
Maybe you're right.
You know him better than I do.

1240
01:28:42,323 --> 01:28:46,160
I guess some folks is built that way.
But that wouldn't work with me.

1241
01:28:46,243 --> 01:28:48,996
You could at least have a kind word
for me now and then.

1242
01:28:49,079 --> 01:28:51,332
Considering what I have to do around here.

1243
01:28:51,415 --> 01:28:55,669
The sweeping, and the cooking, and
the "nursemaiding" that killer back there.

1244
01:28:56,253 --> 01:28:58,464
Not even a "thank you" do I get.

1245
01:28:58,672 --> 01:29:00,549
Maybe you're right, Stumpy.

1246
01:29:01,425 --> 01:29:02,927
You're a treasure.

1247
01:29:04,929 --> 01:29:07,264
I don't know what I'd do without you.

1248
01:29:09,642 --> 01:29:11,185
Go back to being yourself.

1249
01:29:11,268 --> 01:29:13,103
Leastwise I'm used to that.

1250
01:29:48,974 --> 01:29:51,059
He's coming down the street now.

1251
01:29:55,313 --> 01:29:56,940
Good morning, Sheriff.

1252
01:29:57,315 --> 01:29:58,608
Colorado.

1253
01:29:58,817 --> 01:30:01,821
I been hearing a lot of talk.
Thought you might be interested.

1254
01:30:01,904 --> 01:30:03,114
About what?

1255
01:30:03,322 --> 01:30:06,242
Mostly about you telling Burdette
what would happen to Joe...

1256
01:30:06,325 --> 01:30:08,619
...if trouble started around the jail.

1257
01:30:08,744 --> 01:30:12,206
Guess he didn't expect to hear that.
Kind of new to me, too.

1258
01:30:12,331 --> 01:30:14,709
- Would you have said it any different?
- No.

1259
01:30:14,834 --> 01:30:18,379
If he was doing to me what he's doing
to you, I'd tell him the same thing.

1260
01:30:18,462 --> 01:30:21,173
He can't take a chance
on whether you'd do it or not.

1261
01:30:21,257 --> 01:30:22,800
I don't suppose so.

1262
01:30:22,925 --> 01:30:25,928
But you can be sure
he's going to try it a different way.

1263
01:30:26,095 --> 01:30:27,930
Got enough left there for another?

1264
01:30:28,014 --> 01:30:29,765
Sure. Help yourself.

1265
01:30:30,850 --> 01:30:32,935
You always keep that carbine cocked?

1266
01:30:33,060 --> 01:30:34,812
Only when I carry it.

1267
01:30:35,646 --> 01:30:37,523
How come you carry a rifle?

1268
01:30:38,274 --> 01:30:41,527
I found some were faster than me
with a short gun.

1269
01:30:46,199 --> 01:30:48,660
I don't suppose you have a match either?

1270
01:30:48,869 --> 01:30:50,412
All out of them, too.

1271
01:30:50,621 --> 01:30:51,872
I'll get some.

1272
01:31:01,381 --> 01:31:04,301
Sheriff, we ran into some trouble
on the road.

1273
01:31:04,384 --> 01:31:06,637
Al here is hurt. His horse threw him.

1274
01:31:06,720 --> 01:31:09,056
Your deputy said we could find a doctor.

1275
01:31:09,139 --> 01:31:10,766
Round the corner.

1276
01:31:11,225 --> 01:31:13,352
About three or four doors to the right.

1277
01:31:13,477 --> 01:31:15,520
Stay away from that rifle, Sheriff.

1278
01:31:15,646 --> 01:31:17,564
You can see we've still got our guns.

1279
01:31:17,648 --> 01:31:19,900
That ain't your deputy up the street.

1280
01:31:20,067 --> 01:31:21,526
Unloosen that belt.

1281
01:31:25,240 --> 01:31:27,909
- What've you done to him?
- Don't worry about him.

1282
01:31:27,992 --> 01:31:29,953
Worry about yourself. He's all right.

1283
01:31:30,078 --> 01:31:33,248
He ain't going to be and nor are you
unless you do as you're told.

1284
01:31:33,331 --> 01:31:34,332
Stay back here.

1285
01:31:34,415 --> 01:31:36,000
We're going down to the jail.

1286
01:31:36,084 --> 01:31:37,669
You'll turn Joe Burdette loose...

1287
01:31:37,752 --> 01:31:41,214
...or you and your deputy quit worrying
about this whole thing.

1288
01:31:41,339 --> 01:31:42,674
Take your choice.

1289
01:31:42,840 --> 01:31:45,009
Are you just going to stand here?

1290
01:31:45,343 --> 01:31:48,012
If you want to get him shot,
just go out there.

1291
01:31:48,263 --> 01:31:49,764
What'll it be?

1292
01:31:52,600 --> 01:31:55,687
If you want to do something,
when I get out on the porch...

1293
01:31:55,770 --> 01:31:58,523
...take that flowerpot and throw it
through the window.

1294
01:31:58,606 --> 01:32:00,567
Duck after you throw it.

1295
01:32:08,033 --> 01:32:09,994
Just keep coming, mister.

1296
01:32:10,536 --> 01:32:12,663
- Who, me?
- Yes, you.

1297
01:32:31,140 --> 01:32:32,516
Grab that horse.

1298
01:32:39,315 --> 01:32:42,234
- Colorado, where's he going?
- He's going to see if Dude's all right.

1299
01:32:56,666 --> 01:32:58,251
Chance, over here.

1300
01:33:05,258 --> 01:33:07,052
You look a little used.

1301
01:33:07,177 --> 01:33:09,346
What'd they do? I heard shooting.

1302
01:33:09,596 --> 01:33:10,889
They had me cold.

1303
01:33:11,014 --> 01:33:12,933
Going to make me open the jail.

1304
01:33:13,099 --> 01:33:14,351
What happened?

1305
01:33:15,185 --> 01:33:17,437
I didn't have to. Colorado helped me.

1306
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:20,565
If you'd have had him here,
this wouldn't have happened.

1307
01:33:20,690 --> 01:33:22,525
I can get up by myself!

1308
01:33:23,610 --> 01:33:25,071
I let them get me.

1309
01:33:25,196 --> 01:33:28,574
I let them walk right up
and stick my head in the water trough...

1310
01:33:28,699 --> 01:33:30,618
...and it was easy for them.

1311
01:33:32,954 --> 01:33:35,623
I'm good when I'm sober, boy, real good.

1312
01:33:37,041 --> 01:33:38,793
I should have known better.

1313
01:33:38,876 --> 01:33:42,588
A man ought to have sense enough
to know when he's no good no more.

1314
01:33:42,713 --> 01:33:45,132
- Where're you going?
- Get your hands off of me.

1315
01:33:45,216 --> 01:33:46,676
I said where're you going?

1316
01:33:46,801 --> 01:33:49,720
You've got no use for a man
you can't depend on.

1317
01:33:49,804 --> 01:33:51,847
One bad night and I'm done for.

1318
01:33:52,557 --> 01:33:55,893
An old man takes a pot shot at me
and I'm finished.

1319
01:33:56,477 --> 01:33:59,564
I tried and I tried hard,
and where did it get me?

1320
01:33:59,647 --> 01:34:00,856
Look at me.

1321
01:34:01,232 --> 01:34:02,858
I got them so bad.

1322
01:34:03,651 --> 01:34:06,154
What can a man do with hands like that?

1323
01:34:06,989 --> 01:34:09,241
I'm through. I quit, John. I quit.

1324
01:34:09,908 --> 01:34:11,493
All right, quit.

1325
01:34:12,160 --> 01:34:13,870
Nobody's trying to stop you.

1326
01:34:13,996 --> 01:34:15,956
If you want to quit, quit.

1327
01:34:16,081 --> 01:34:18,333
Go on back to the bottle, get drunk!

1328
01:34:18,500 --> 01:34:20,002
One thing, though.

1329
01:34:20,085 --> 01:34:24,923
Somebody throws a dollar in a spittoon,
don't expect me to do something about it.

1330
01:34:25,257 --> 01:34:28,176
Just get down on your knees
and go after it.

1331
01:34:30,429 --> 01:34:31,722
I'm sorry.

1332
01:34:33,181 --> 01:34:35,434
"Sorry" don't get it done, Dude.

1333
01:34:35,851 --> 01:34:39,187
That's the second time you hit me.
Don't ever do it again.

1334
01:34:41,273 --> 01:34:42,774
Maybe you're right.

1335
01:34:43,859 --> 01:34:46,070
Maybe you aren't much good anymore.

1336
01:34:50,950 --> 01:34:52,577
Here are your guns.

1337
01:34:53,953 --> 01:34:56,581
Fellow that took your hat
must have left this.

1338
01:34:56,706 --> 01:34:58,625
You get something out of it.

1339
01:34:59,626 --> 01:35:03,755
Now come on down to the jail, and
I'll give you the money you got coming.

1340
01:35:09,886 --> 01:35:11,721
I think this is your horse.

1341
01:35:11,804 --> 01:35:13,681
Yeah, that's mine. Thanks.

1342
01:35:14,557 --> 01:35:16,226
I guess Dude's all right.

1343
01:35:16,309 --> 01:35:17,685
Anyway, he's walking.

1344
01:35:17,810 --> 01:35:19,145
I'm so glad.

1345
01:35:19,646 --> 01:35:21,064
I was afraid.

1346
01:35:22,398 --> 01:35:23,608
My stomach seems...

1347
01:35:23,733 --> 01:35:25,986
Come on, maybe a drink will help.

1348
01:35:39,750 --> 01:35:42,461
Go on up to the jail and wait for me there.

1349
01:35:44,088 --> 01:35:46,382
Tell Stumpy to give you a drink.

1350
01:35:53,597 --> 01:35:56,850
What do you wish me to do
with this three dead men?

1351
01:35:57,017 --> 01:35:59,436
You're the undertaker, Bert. Bury them.

1352
01:35:59,603 --> 01:36:03,607
There's another one down by the bridge.
Send in your bill and the county'll pay you.

1353
01:36:03,691 --> 01:36:04,775
No need for that.

1354
01:36:04,858 --> 01:36:08,530
Each one of them had two new $50
gold pieces in his pocket.

1355
01:36:08,613 --> 01:36:09,948
Price is going up.

1356
01:36:10,031 --> 01:36:11,116
What?

1357
01:36:11,199 --> 01:36:12,534
Nothing, Bert.

1358
01:36:12,784 --> 01:36:15,287
Bring their guns and other stuff to the jail.

1359
01:36:15,370 --> 01:36:16,496
It will be done.

1360
01:36:16,621 --> 01:36:18,248
Here is your gun.

1361
01:36:18,373 --> 01:36:20,083
Thank you, Carlitos.

1362
01:36:20,625 --> 01:36:21,918
Where's Colorado?

1363
01:36:22,043 --> 01:36:24,212
He's inside the hotel.
He took the girl Feathers.

1364
01:36:26,715 --> 01:36:28,925
Better give me another, Colorado.

1365
01:36:29,384 --> 01:36:30,468
Yes, ma'am.

1366
01:36:30,552 --> 01:36:33,889
Look at me, Colorado, take a good look.

1367
01:36:34,556 --> 01:36:37,893
Would you say my head is soft?
Would you say I'm an idiot?

1368
01:36:38,476 --> 01:36:39,603
No, ma'am.

1369
01:36:40,145 --> 01:36:41,938
You'd be a liar then.

1370
01:36:43,398 --> 01:36:45,150
Better go easy on that stuff.

1371
01:36:45,233 --> 01:36:47,403
- That makes three you've had.
- Yep.

1372
01:36:47,820 --> 01:36:50,364
You'd be lying because that's what I am.

1373
01:36:50,573 --> 01:36:52,241
A softheaded idiot.

1374
01:36:52,575 --> 01:36:56,245
There isn't any other explanation
for staying around here...

1375
01:36:56,412 --> 01:36:59,248
...and inviting myself into this.
He told me...

1376
01:37:03,502 --> 01:37:04,462
Hi, Sheriff.

1377
01:37:04,587 --> 01:37:07,340
We saw you coming back.
Dude was all right, wasn't he?

1378
01:37:07,423 --> 01:37:10,718
He's all right. So am I, thanks to you.

1379
01:37:11,427 --> 01:37:15,473
- Thank the lady here.
- Sure, thank the lady. She did a big thing.

1380
01:37:15,598 --> 01:37:19,727
She threw a flowerpot through the window
and helped get three men killed.

1381
01:37:20,019 --> 01:37:21,562
Or was it four?

1382
01:37:21,854 --> 01:37:23,356
Why did you make me do it?

1383
01:37:23,439 --> 01:37:26,275
- I made you do it?
- Sure, you did. Didn't he, Colorado?

1384
01:37:26,359 --> 01:37:28,528
He wasn't going to do
what those men told him.

1385
01:37:28,612 --> 01:37:29,863
Not him.

1386
01:37:30,280 --> 01:37:33,617
You were just going to get yourself killed,
that's all.

1387
01:37:34,117 --> 01:37:35,285
Somebody had to...

1388
01:37:35,369 --> 01:37:37,079
What were you going to do, Sheriff?

1389
01:37:37,204 --> 01:37:39,414
I'm glad I didn't have to make up my mind.

1390
01:37:39,539 --> 01:37:42,209
You weren't going down to that jail.

1391
01:37:42,292 --> 01:37:44,169
So somebody had to help you.

1392
01:37:44,294 --> 01:37:46,964
But you don't want anybody to do that,
do you?

1393
01:37:47,881 --> 01:37:50,717
You're right, you didn't make me help you.

1394
01:37:51,134 --> 01:37:52,803
It was my own idea.

1395
01:37:53,053 --> 01:37:56,139
It was my idea to stay.
You told me to get on that stage.

1396
01:37:56,223 --> 01:37:57,891
I know you did.

1397
01:37:57,975 --> 01:37:59,226
I'm glad you didn't.

1398
01:37:59,309 --> 01:38:00,435
What?

1399
01:38:00,561 --> 01:38:02,229
I'm glad you didn't go.

1400
01:38:06,650 --> 01:38:09,279
What'd you have to say a thing
like that for?

1401
01:38:09,404 --> 01:38:14,075
You know, just when we get one thing
settled you have to go bring up another.

1402
01:38:15,493 --> 01:38:17,996
You just don't make any sense, that's all.

1403
01:38:18,079 --> 01:38:19,706
And neither do I.

1404
01:38:19,998 --> 01:38:23,167
And neither do you, Colorado.
What're you doing in this?

1405
01:38:23,334 --> 01:38:25,670
You don't have the excuse that I have.

1406
01:38:30,758 --> 01:38:33,595
I better go before I make a fool of myself.

1407
01:38:35,346 --> 01:38:38,850
I don't know why I should go, though,
because we're all fools.

1408
01:38:39,100 --> 01:38:42,103
We ought to get along very well together,
all of us.

1409
01:38:43,521 --> 01:38:45,189
I'm going, anyway.

1410
01:38:45,690 --> 01:38:48,235
We're just a bunch of idiots, that's all.

1411
01:38:48,360 --> 01:38:50,696
Just a bunch of idiots.

1412
01:38:52,698 --> 01:38:54,867
How did she get mixed up in this?

1413
01:38:55,367 --> 01:38:57,119
She didn't feel too good.

1414
01:38:57,286 --> 01:39:01,081
- She had a couple of drinks.
- I don't mean this. I mean out there.

1415
01:39:01,540 --> 01:39:05,794
She was going outside to help you.
How, I don't know. And neither did she.

1416
01:39:06,545 --> 01:39:10,841
I told her to throw that pot through
the window and I went out instead.

1417
01:39:10,966 --> 01:39:13,677
And that's your reason
for throwing in with me.

1418
01:39:13,969 --> 01:39:15,971
She's right. It doesn't make any sense.

1419
01:39:16,055 --> 01:39:18,515
Wheeler just talked about helping me.

1420
01:39:18,641 --> 01:39:20,517
But you saved my neck.

1421
01:39:20,643 --> 01:39:23,270
Burdette isn't going to kiss you for that.

1422
01:39:23,395 --> 01:39:24,730
So you're in.

1423
01:39:25,731 --> 01:39:29,611
Don't tell me you didn't think about that.
Before you did it, I mean.

1424
01:39:29,819 --> 01:39:32,656
If I'm going to get shot at,
I might as well get paid for it.

1425
01:39:32,739 --> 01:39:34,532
How do I get a badge?

1426
01:39:34,824 --> 01:39:36,618
Come on, I'll get you one.

1427
01:39:37,577 --> 01:39:40,664
I ought to tell you. Dude's quitting.

1428
01:39:42,082 --> 01:39:45,919
I'm sorry for that.
But I figure why is not my business.

1429
01:39:46,670 --> 01:39:50,173
You've got peculiar ways of choosing
what is your business.

1430
01:39:53,677 --> 01:39:57,973
You telling me they was going to bring
Chance in here to make me turn Joe loose?

1431
01:39:58,098 --> 01:39:59,474
Why, they're crazy.

1432
01:39:59,599 --> 01:40:00,934
God darn fools.

1433
01:40:01,017 --> 01:40:04,020
Chance brings in three strangers,
tells me to unlock the door...

1434
01:40:04,104 --> 01:40:07,774
...what do they think I'm going to do?
You know what I'm going to do.

1435
01:40:08,191 --> 01:40:10,194
I'm going to start blasting.

1436
01:40:11,279 --> 01:40:12,780
Where'd you get that hat?

1437
01:40:12,863 --> 01:40:14,991
Chance gave it to me. For a souvenir.

1438
01:40:15,116 --> 01:40:15,908
For a what?

1439
01:40:16,033 --> 01:40:18,536
- Stumpy, we're coming in.
- Well, come ahead.

1440
01:40:18,619 --> 01:40:20,663
See, he ain't too proud to yell.

1441
01:40:23,624 --> 01:40:26,544
Stumpy, where do you keep
the deputy sheriff badges?

1442
01:40:26,627 --> 01:40:28,754
In the right-hand drawer there.

1443
01:40:28,963 --> 01:40:31,382
You know where that book is,
the one with the oath?

1444
01:40:31,465 --> 01:40:35,052
No! If you can't take care of your own
truck don't look for me to do it.

1445
01:40:35,136 --> 01:40:38,014
We'll have to do without it.
Raise your right hand.

1446
01:40:38,139 --> 01:40:41,350
Do you solemnly swear to take
on the duties of a sheriff's deputy...

1447
01:40:41,475 --> 01:40:44,562
Found yourself another knot-head
who don't know when he's well off?

1448
01:40:44,645 --> 01:40:47,648
...in the County of Presidio
of the great State of Texas?

1449
01:40:47,732 --> 01:40:48,816
I do.

1450
01:40:49,151 --> 01:40:51,695
And that includes taking orders from me.

1451
01:40:52,154 --> 01:40:54,740
All right, Sheriff.
How about giving me one.

1452
01:40:54,823 --> 01:40:57,159
Get over to the hotel
and pick up your stuff.

1453
01:40:57,242 --> 01:40:58,702
Move in here.

1454
01:40:59,411 --> 01:41:01,079
What are you laughing about?

1455
01:41:01,163 --> 01:41:03,081
What I got myself in for.

1456
01:41:04,833 --> 01:41:06,668
Cheerful about it anyways, ain't he?

1457
01:41:06,752 --> 01:41:09,212
- How good do you think he is?
- He's all right.

1458
01:41:09,338 --> 01:41:11,590
You think he's as good
as Wheeler said he was?

1459
01:41:11,673 --> 01:41:14,927
He threw me my gun and while it was
in the air, he got one of them.

1460
01:41:15,010 --> 01:41:17,596
- Then he got another one.
- Good enough.

1461
01:41:17,763 --> 01:41:19,806
Is he as good as I used to be?

1462
01:41:22,768 --> 01:41:24,478
It'd be pretty close.

1463
01:41:24,603 --> 01:41:27,189
I'd hate to have to live on the difference.

1464
01:41:28,941 --> 01:41:32,528
Then you got the best of it. Him for me.

1465
01:41:34,614 --> 01:41:36,658
What's he talking about, him for me?

1466
01:41:36,783 --> 01:41:39,452
Nobody never tells me
nothing around here.

1467
01:41:39,535 --> 01:41:41,037
He's quitting.

1468
01:41:43,706 --> 01:41:45,250
What's got into you?

1469
01:41:45,375 --> 01:41:47,877
Look at me. Ain't that pretty?

1470
01:41:48,378 --> 01:41:50,004
Shaking worse all the time.

1471
01:41:50,129 --> 01:41:53,132
What can a man do with hands like that?
Tell me, what?

1472
01:41:53,216 --> 01:41:57,053
Take a drink! You said Chance told you to.
You did, didn't you, Chance?

1473
01:41:57,220 --> 01:41:59,138
He can take the whole bottle.

1474
01:41:59,222 --> 01:42:00,765
Go ahead.

1475
01:42:26,333 --> 01:42:27,293
Stumpy.

1476
01:42:29,420 --> 01:42:30,754
Don't close it.

1477
01:42:52,027 --> 01:42:53,528
Didn't spill a drop.

1478
01:42:57,282 --> 01:42:58,867
Shakes are gone...

1479
01:42:59,618 --> 01:43:01,870
...just because of a piece of music.

1480
01:43:03,955 --> 01:43:07,876
Till they played that piece,
I forgot how I got into this thing.

1481
01:43:09,711 --> 01:43:13,089
Keep on playing it,
I don't think I'll ever forget again.

1482
01:43:13,965 --> 01:43:17,344
Chance, give me another shot at it...

1483
01:43:18,637 --> 01:43:20,847
...Stumpy can take the bottle away.

1484
01:43:25,560 --> 01:43:26,811
You heard him.

1485
01:43:29,481 --> 01:43:33,194
Bring it out, put it back.
Nobody ever asks me if I need a drink.

1486
01:43:33,903 --> 01:43:36,405
I ain't going to wait for them to ask me,
because I do.

1487
01:43:36,489 --> 01:43:38,908
You two are enough to drive a man to it.

1488
01:43:41,994 --> 01:43:44,330
I think I'll go watch the road again.

1489
01:43:45,164 --> 01:43:47,541
Unless you need me for something else.

1490
01:43:49,085 --> 01:43:50,836
Did you forget this?

1491
01:43:52,505 --> 01:43:53,965
You could clean up a little.

1492
01:43:54,090 --> 01:43:56,634
Yeah, you're a heck of a looking deputy.

1493
01:43:57,343 --> 01:43:59,095
I'm better than I look.

1494
01:43:59,595 --> 01:44:01,180
I'll do that tonight.

1495
01:44:01,264 --> 01:44:05,351
If you think of it, send me some food.
I think I could eat something.

1496
01:44:08,104 --> 01:44:10,064
Nothing in his stomach.

1497
01:44:10,356 --> 01:44:11,775
Nothing but guts.

1498
01:44:12,442 --> 01:44:15,445
You can quit worrying about him
and start thinking about me.

1499
01:44:15,529 --> 01:44:18,282
We know about him,
he's going to be all right, but I ain't.

1500
01:44:18,365 --> 01:44:21,285
That got my goat.
I can't watch a man get down.

1501
01:44:21,368 --> 01:44:22,911
Where're you going?

1502
01:44:23,537 --> 01:44:26,123
To get Dude something to eat.
And you'd better...

1503
01:44:26,206 --> 01:44:28,292
I know, get back in my hole.

1504
01:44:28,375 --> 01:44:31,712
No, you'd better watch out for Colorado
when he comes back.

1505
01:44:31,795 --> 01:44:34,631
I forgot to tell him
how trigger-happy you are.

1506
01:44:34,881 --> 01:44:39,177
We get a good man, he has to watch you
to keep from getting shot full of holes.

1507
01:44:39,303 --> 01:44:40,887
Close the window!

1508
01:44:42,139 --> 01:44:45,309
Still talking about that little accident
last night.

1509
01:44:45,559 --> 01:44:48,186
Never can satisfy him.

1510
01:47:00,197 --> 01:47:02,325
That's real pretty. Go on, play some more.

1511
01:47:02,450 --> 01:47:04,243
Why don't you play something
I can sing with you?

1512
01:47:12,960 --> 01:47:13,878
Good one.

1513
01:48:21,948 --> 01:48:23,783
That's nice. Ain't it, Chance?

1514
01:48:23,950 --> 01:48:26,869
It's better than being out
in the street and getting shot at.

1515
01:48:26,953 --> 01:48:28,663
I can't argue with you.

1516
01:48:28,788 --> 01:48:30,873
- You're right, Stumpy.
- Right about what?

1517
01:48:30,957 --> 01:48:34,335
- I should have thought of it before.
- Thought about what?

1518
01:48:34,460 --> 01:48:38,214
Burdette's shown his hand.
He isn't going to rush this jail.

1519
01:48:38,298 --> 01:48:40,592
Everything he's tried has been outside.

1520
01:48:40,717 --> 01:48:43,052
We could sit here and wait for the marshal.

1521
01:48:43,136 --> 01:48:44,971
Only be three or four days.

1522
01:48:45,471 --> 01:48:48,057
How much food you got, Stumpy?
Enough for all of us?

1523
01:48:48,141 --> 01:48:50,101
Yeah, if you can eat what I eat.

1524
01:48:50,226 --> 01:48:52,562
- Water and firewood?
- Filled up this morning.

1525
01:48:52,645 --> 01:48:55,858
We do need some blankets and tobacco,
and matches.

1526
01:48:55,983 --> 01:48:58,485
- Less you got plenty.
- He ain't.

1527
01:48:58,652 --> 01:49:01,238
- And a few bottles of beer, Dude?
- Thanks, Stumpy.

1528
01:49:01,322 --> 01:49:02,990
There's another thing now...

1529
01:49:03,073 --> 01:49:07,286
...if we're all going to be in here
three or four days, close together like...

1530
01:49:07,494 --> 01:49:11,832
...it might be a good idea if a certain
party, not to mention no names was to...

1531
01:49:11,916 --> 01:49:13,459
...do what he said he'd do.

1532
01:49:13,584 --> 01:49:17,338
A horse barn's a good place but it ain't
a place for a fellow to roll around in.

1533
01:49:17,421 --> 01:49:18,505
All right, Stumpy.

1534
01:49:18,589 --> 01:49:22,468
Me, I like roses, but this fellow
ain't no rose this fellow I'm talking about.

1535
01:49:22,593 --> 01:49:25,012
I'm going to take a bath. I said I would.

1536
01:49:25,179 --> 01:49:27,848
Dude, I never had no idea you wouldn't.

1537
01:49:28,098 --> 01:49:30,100
I was just a wondering when.

1538
01:49:30,184 --> 01:49:32,686
He'll keep talking till we get out of here.

1539
01:49:32,770 --> 01:49:35,315
I'll take a bath
while you gather up the stuff.

1540
01:49:35,440 --> 01:49:39,110
Yell when you get back, because
you look different when you're clean.

1541
01:49:42,530 --> 01:49:43,949
How you do that?

1542
01:49:44,032 --> 01:49:46,785
It's easy, Carlos.
You just weren't watching.

1543
01:49:47,869 --> 01:49:49,204
Carlos, open up.

1544
01:49:49,371 --> 01:49:50,372
Coming.

1545
01:49:52,791 --> 01:49:56,336
Buenas tardes, Señor Chance.
I think it is best to lock the door.

1546
01:49:57,295 --> 01:50:00,507
Carlos, I'm sleeping over at the jail tonight.
All of us are.

1547
01:50:00,632 --> 01:50:04,135
We'll need some blankets,
plenty of tobacco, and matches.

1548
01:50:04,636 --> 01:50:06,805
- And some beer, too.
- Feeling better?

1549
01:50:06,888 --> 01:50:07,973
Much better.

1550
01:50:08,056 --> 01:50:10,183
- That's all you need?
- That's all.

1551
01:50:10,308 --> 01:50:14,437
When you get the stuff together,
let us know. I'll be upstairs.

1552
01:50:18,901 --> 01:50:20,778
Now don't make any noise.

1553
01:50:23,573 --> 01:50:24,949
Open your mouth.

1554
01:50:50,683 --> 01:50:52,018
Hi, Feathers.

1555
01:50:52,101 --> 01:50:54,437
Have you got any soap
that smells like roses?

1556
01:50:54,520 --> 01:50:57,190
I have some soap,
but it doesn't smell like a rose.

1557
01:50:57,274 --> 01:50:59,985
Won't do. Won't do. Stumpy likes roses.

1558
01:51:00,777 --> 01:51:01,987
Who's Stumpy?

1559
01:51:02,112 --> 01:51:03,989
The fellow that likes roses.

1560
01:51:04,114 --> 01:51:05,908
No, he watches the jail.

1561
01:51:06,033 --> 01:51:06,950
Hurry it up.

1562
01:51:07,034 --> 01:51:08,160
Right away.

1563
01:51:08,285 --> 01:51:11,330
Yeah, what's all this
about moving down to the jail?

1564
01:51:11,955 --> 01:51:14,958
Something I should have done
two or three days ago.

1565
01:51:15,042 --> 01:51:16,793
Are you sorry you didn't?

1566
01:51:18,295 --> 01:51:19,463
Are you?

1567
01:51:20,130 --> 01:51:22,299
I know an easy way of telling you.

1568
01:51:24,801 --> 01:51:26,970
Can't you talk plainer than that?

1569
01:51:27,554 --> 01:51:29,014
Chance, give me a towel.

1570
01:51:29,139 --> 01:51:30,057
I'm busy.

1571
01:51:30,140 --> 01:51:31,308
What'd you say?

1572
01:51:31,391 --> 01:51:33,185
Somebody's telling me something.

1573
01:51:33,310 --> 01:51:36,396
I can't... Give me a towel, will you?

1574
01:51:38,399 --> 01:51:39,984
He's a big help.

1575
01:51:40,234 --> 01:51:42,236
I'll finish telling you later.

1576
01:51:50,745 --> 01:51:52,413
The Dude went in to take a bath.

1577
01:51:52,497 --> 01:51:55,083
I couldn't see,
but I don't think he has his guns.

1578
01:51:55,166 --> 01:51:58,544
The sheriff's upstairs talking to the girl.
He has his gun.

1579
01:51:58,753 --> 01:52:00,672
I don't want to go up and get him.

1580
01:52:00,755 --> 01:52:03,466
- Burdette wants him alive.
- Then don't talk so loud.

1581
01:52:03,591 --> 01:52:06,844
He'll come charging here with that rifle
and we'll have to kill him.

1582
01:52:06,928 --> 01:52:09,222
- That might just work.
- What?

1583
01:52:09,931 --> 01:52:11,599
The stairs are pretty dark.

1584
01:52:11,683 --> 01:52:14,352
We stretch a rope across them.
Let him hear something.

1585
01:52:14,435 --> 01:52:17,690
Give me that piece of rope.
Come on, give me a hand.

1586
01:52:35,874 --> 01:52:37,293
Hurry it up, will you?

1587
01:52:37,376 --> 01:52:38,711
Be right out.

1588
01:52:41,380 --> 01:52:44,049
If you're leaving,
I might as well get some sleep.

1589
01:52:44,133 --> 01:52:47,052
I don't suppose I could come by
the jail once in a while...

1590
01:52:47,136 --> 01:52:51,015
...and see if you needed anything.
- I don't want you anyplace around there.

1591
01:52:51,557 --> 01:52:53,142
I was afraid of that.

1592
01:52:53,892 --> 01:52:56,812
That means I won't see you
for three or four days.

1593
01:52:57,480 --> 01:52:59,482
That's a long time, you know.

1594
01:53:00,567 --> 01:53:02,319
You'll live through it.

1595
01:53:03,737 --> 01:53:05,405
Yeah, you do the same.

1596
01:53:16,917 --> 01:53:20,295
All right, you both better get out there.
You, too, Pedro.

1597
01:53:20,503 --> 01:53:22,505
Leave the door open a little.

1598
01:53:22,756 --> 01:53:24,758
Get the gag out of her mouth.

1599
01:53:25,842 --> 01:53:29,012
Now, lady,
we want you to call the sheriff down here.

1600
01:53:29,429 --> 01:53:30,889
No! No!

1601
01:53:31,681 --> 01:53:33,183
Maybe this'll help.

1602
01:53:33,600 --> 01:53:36,019
Please don't. Don't!

1603
01:53:44,111 --> 01:53:46,364
He's out cold. Get upstairs, quick!

1604
01:53:49,450 --> 01:53:50,743
Hold it, Dude.

1605
01:53:51,118 --> 01:53:52,286
Watch him.

1606
01:53:55,456 --> 01:53:57,208
Just keep coming, lady.

1607
01:53:58,125 --> 01:54:00,253
All right, everybody, downstairs.

1608
01:54:08,970 --> 01:54:11,138
All right, get on your feet.

1609
01:54:18,229 --> 01:54:19,606
Come on, get up!

1610
01:54:26,989 --> 01:54:28,240
Can you walk?

1611
01:54:30,492 --> 01:54:31,868
Where're we going?

1612
01:54:31,994 --> 01:54:33,161
That's up to you.

1613
01:54:33,245 --> 01:54:35,247
We go to the jail and you let Joe go.

1614
01:54:35,330 --> 01:54:37,874
Or we tuck you two away
and make a trade with Stumpy.

1615
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:39,084
Take your choice.

1616
01:54:39,167 --> 01:54:41,461
You won't make any deal with Stumpy.

1617
01:54:42,004 --> 01:54:45,090
- You'll just get Joe killed.
- Not if he knows we got you two.

1618
01:54:45,173 --> 01:54:47,217
They got us. We're licked.

1619
01:54:47,342 --> 01:54:50,929
Go on, take them over to the jail,
and tell Stumpy to open up and let Joe go.

1620
01:54:51,013 --> 01:54:53,807
- Are you out of your mind?
- I'm telling you to do it now.

1621
01:54:53,932 --> 01:54:57,436
Stumpy couldn't hold out. He hasn't got
water or food and he's all alone.

1622
01:54:57,519 --> 01:54:59,897
Nobody to get him any water.
Now go on, do it.

1623
01:55:00,023 --> 01:55:01,941
- Do you know what you're saying?
- I do.

1624
01:55:02,025 --> 01:55:04,777
I'm thinking good, too.
Now do what I tell you.

1625
01:55:06,446 --> 01:55:08,615
And then after they get Joe,
what happens?

1626
01:55:08,698 --> 01:55:10,450
All we want is Joe.

1627
01:55:13,536 --> 01:55:17,040
- You still think it's a good idea?
- I still think it's good.

1628
01:55:19,459 --> 01:55:20,960
We'll go over to the jail.

1629
01:55:21,044 --> 01:55:22,712
Take the shells out of his gun.

1630
01:55:22,795 --> 01:55:24,297
I unloaded his pistol.

1631
01:55:24,380 --> 01:55:26,799
Steve, you and Harry come along with me.

1632
01:55:26,883 --> 01:55:30,094
Now look, Sheriff,
we're going out of here natural like.

1633
01:55:30,803 --> 01:55:33,514
You carry your gun
and don't do anything to make anybody...

1634
01:55:33,640 --> 01:55:35,475
...think something is wrong.

1635
01:55:35,558 --> 01:55:39,355
If you have to explain to Stumpy,
tell him we put up bail for Joe.

1636
01:55:39,897 --> 01:55:42,608
Burdette's got it figured out pretty good.

1637
01:55:42,733 --> 01:55:46,362
If it was up to me,
you'd have never got up off the floor.

1638
01:55:46,904 --> 01:55:49,573
Some of those you killed
were friends of mine.

1639
01:55:49,823 --> 01:55:51,283
Give him his rifle.

1640
01:55:54,328 --> 01:55:55,412
You first.

1641
01:56:32,867 --> 01:56:34,077
Hold it.

1642
01:56:34,953 --> 01:56:38,707
Yell to Stumpy you're coming in.
We've been watching you.

1643
01:56:40,542 --> 01:56:42,377
Stumpy, this is Chance.

1644
01:56:42,460 --> 01:56:44,045
It took you long enough.

1645
01:56:44,129 --> 01:56:46,256
Steve, cover from out here.

1646
01:56:54,306 --> 01:56:57,517
All right, open up.
We're going to let Joe go.

1647
01:56:57,642 --> 01:56:58,935
How come?

1648
01:56:59,728 --> 01:57:01,897
His friends here put up bail.

1649
01:57:02,481 --> 01:57:05,401
Give me the keys then.
They're on your desk there.

1650
01:57:06,485 --> 01:57:07,737
I forgot.

1651
01:57:17,663 --> 01:57:18,664
Easy.

1652
01:57:18,748 --> 01:57:22,001
- This fellow will talk all right.
- Watch him. I'm going after Dude.

1653
01:57:22,084 --> 01:57:24,545
You go along with him. I'll watch him.

1654
01:57:27,506 --> 01:57:28,966
Now watch yourself.

1655
01:57:29,091 --> 01:57:31,260
There's two of them holding Dude.

1656
01:57:33,679 --> 01:57:34,847
The window.

1657
01:57:46,777 --> 01:57:48,528
All right, Colorado.

1658
01:57:56,787 --> 01:57:58,664
In here.

1659
01:57:59,289 --> 01:58:00,290
They're gone.

1660
01:58:00,374 --> 01:58:02,709
They took Dude
when they heard the shooting.

1661
01:58:02,793 --> 01:58:06,338
They went out the back door.
They had horses. I heard them.

1662
01:58:09,216 --> 01:58:10,968
They've gone all right.

1663
01:58:12,219 --> 01:58:14,054
We going to go after them?

1664
01:58:15,305 --> 01:58:20,394
I told Nathan Burdette what'd happen
if he came after his brother.

1665
01:58:21,729 --> 01:58:23,439
You ought to remember that.

1666
01:58:23,564 --> 01:58:25,233
You thought it was funny.

1667
01:58:25,316 --> 01:58:28,194
What do you think he'd do
if we went after Dude?

1668
01:58:28,486 --> 01:58:29,779
I didn't think.

1669
01:58:30,071 --> 01:58:32,323
Think the shoe's on the other foot now.

1670
01:58:32,407 --> 01:58:35,118
The men who took Dude,
they were very angry.

1671
01:58:35,410 --> 01:58:37,495
They say Dude set a trap for them.

1672
01:58:37,579 --> 01:58:39,789
He sent them over there, all right.

1673
01:58:40,081 --> 01:58:43,418
He knew what he was doing.
Knew what Stumpy would do, too.

1674
01:58:44,502 --> 01:58:46,462
That's why they're not happy about it.

1675
01:58:46,588 --> 01:58:47,839
What're you going to do?

1676
01:58:47,922 --> 01:58:49,924
It's what Burdette will do.

1677
01:58:50,925 --> 01:58:53,177
Carlos. Get a hold of Burdette.

1678
01:58:53,928 --> 01:58:56,764
I don't care how.
Tell him I want to talk to him.

1679
01:58:56,848 --> 01:59:00,518
Tell him to set the time and the place.
But I want to talk to him.

1680
01:59:00,685 --> 01:59:02,605
We'll be at the jail.

1681
01:59:08,027 --> 01:59:10,904
Aren't you sorry now
you didn't get on the stage?

1682
01:59:16,452 --> 01:59:17,870
Come on, Colorado.

1683
01:59:18,120 --> 01:59:20,331
Let's wake up the Chinaman again.

1684
01:59:50,153 --> 01:59:52,322
It's me, Carlos.

1685
01:59:56,993 --> 01:59:58,912
What's the matter? What'd he say?

1686
01:59:58,995 --> 02:00:00,830
He say he don't want to talk to you.

1687
02:00:00,914 --> 02:00:03,833
He say if you want Dude back,
he'll make a trade.

1688
02:00:03,917 --> 02:00:04,751
A trade?

1689
02:00:04,834 --> 02:00:06,044
Dude for Joe.

1690
02:00:06,169 --> 02:00:08,505
He'll be in his place over by the creek.

1691
02:00:08,672 --> 02:00:09,506
Warehouse?

1692
02:00:09,589 --> 02:00:10,257
Sí.

1693
02:00:10,340 --> 02:00:12,592
He'll be there half an hour after sunup.

1694
02:00:12,676 --> 02:00:16,263
He'll have Dude.
If you'll bring Joe, he'll be waiting.

1695
02:00:16,346 --> 02:00:18,056
He said to let him know.

1696
02:00:23,437 --> 02:00:24,897
Tell him we'll be there.

1697
02:00:25,022 --> 02:00:27,483
You're crazy! You can't do that!

1698
02:00:27,608 --> 02:00:29,777
Not even if Dude was your own brother.

1699
02:00:29,860 --> 02:00:30,820
What can I do?

1700
02:00:30,945 --> 02:00:34,365
What we figured on doing.
Hole up till the marshal comes.

1701
02:00:34,448 --> 02:00:37,285
When the marshal takes Joe,
what'll happen to Dude?

1702
02:00:37,368 --> 02:00:40,329
Dude knew what he was in for
when he sent you over here.

1703
02:00:40,454 --> 02:00:43,124
I'd like to add my two cents worth, Sheriff.

1704
02:00:43,374 --> 02:00:44,333
Go ahead.

1705
02:00:44,458 --> 02:00:47,044
From what I hear,
you and Dude are the only witnesses.

1706
02:00:47,128 --> 02:00:49,505
Let's say that we're the only ones
that'll talk.

1707
02:00:49,630 --> 02:00:52,466
After Nathan gets Joe back,
he's still got to live here.

1708
02:00:52,550 --> 02:00:56,596
Which means you two can't, and
if you don't have Joe, what'll stop him?

1709
02:00:56,721 --> 02:00:58,139
The brakes'll be off then.

1710
02:00:58,222 --> 02:01:00,558
That ought to be as plain
as the nose on your face.

1711
02:01:00,641 --> 02:01:02,435
You're right, Colorado.

1712
02:01:03,061 --> 02:01:05,147
But you and Stumpy didn't see the killing.

1713
02:01:05,230 --> 02:01:07,357
I don't think he'll bother you two.

1714
02:01:07,482 --> 02:01:09,067
- I'm not worried.
- Me neither.

1715
02:01:09,151 --> 02:01:11,278
You'll just wait for the marshal to come.

1716
02:01:11,403 --> 02:01:14,156
- He's still going to want you and Dude.
- I'd say so.

1717
02:01:14,239 --> 02:01:16,992
You can't get out of town
because he's got it bottled up.

1718
02:01:17,075 --> 02:01:20,287
When you make the trade
then Burdette's going to get both of you.

1719
02:01:20,412 --> 02:01:22,164
After a little argument.

1720
02:01:22,247 --> 02:01:25,959
- But why at all? Why the both of you?
- Dude ought to have a chance.

1721
02:01:26,084 --> 02:01:28,795
He won't get one the other way. Will he?

1722
02:01:29,171 --> 02:01:30,380
Will he?

1723
02:01:31,256 --> 02:01:33,133
You're going to have me crying.

1724
02:01:33,258 --> 02:01:38,096
Fellow's got to be a drunk to get anywhere
around here. I might as well start now.

1725
02:01:40,265 --> 02:01:41,683
Go ahead, Carlos.

1726
02:02:00,286 --> 02:02:01,704
Burdette's here.

1727
02:02:04,540 --> 02:02:06,000
About time to go.

1728
02:02:06,376 --> 02:02:09,003
How about I go ahead,
see if they'll play any tricks?

1729
02:02:09,128 --> 02:02:10,588
Look out here.

1730
02:02:11,464 --> 02:02:13,591
We're drawing quite a crowd.

1731
02:02:13,800 --> 02:02:17,595
There won't be any tricks.
At least not till we make the trade.

1732
02:02:17,804 --> 02:02:19,806
Besides, you're not going.

1733
02:02:20,056 --> 02:02:23,226
When you decided to make the trade
for Dude, I went along with you.

1734
02:02:23,309 --> 02:02:24,853
I'm going along now.

1735
02:02:25,062 --> 02:02:26,105
Why?

1736
02:02:27,147 --> 02:02:29,191
Just say I'd like a closer look.

1737
02:02:32,569 --> 02:02:35,489
Up to now I thought you were smart.
Stumpy, you're not going.

1738
02:02:35,572 --> 02:02:38,575
Why ain't I going?
Give me one good reason why?

1739
02:02:39,243 --> 02:02:40,411
I'll give you one.

1740
02:02:40,494 --> 02:02:44,540
You've done a good job in here because
you haven't had to move around much.

1741
02:02:44,665 --> 02:02:48,544
But out there if anything happens,
you'll have to move, and move fast.

1742
02:02:48,669 --> 02:02:51,005
I'd feel better if you weren't there.

1743
02:02:51,839 --> 02:02:54,967
It's plain enough.
Old cripples ain't wanted.

1744
02:02:57,094 --> 02:02:58,804
You give me a reason.

1745
02:03:02,766 --> 02:03:07,939
Do you want that I should bring Joe out,
or do you want to do that yourself?

1746
02:03:08,356 --> 02:03:09,858
Bring him out.

1747
02:03:17,365 --> 02:03:20,410
I think I'll take along a rifle,
some extra shells.

1748
02:03:29,544 --> 02:03:31,630
I told you I'd get out of here.

1749
02:03:31,963 --> 02:03:34,925
Open your mouth again
and we'll carry you out.

1750
02:03:36,217 --> 02:03:37,844
See you, Stumpy.

1751
02:03:43,642 --> 02:03:44,643
See you.

1752
02:04:36,947 --> 02:04:38,657
That's far enough, Joe.

1753
02:04:43,954 --> 02:04:45,372
Through the barn.

1754
02:04:57,384 --> 02:05:01,430
Just sit down over there
on those grain sacks.

1755
02:05:25,079 --> 02:05:26,789
You want a closer look?

1756
02:05:27,665 --> 02:05:29,459
This is close enough.

1757
02:05:30,001 --> 02:05:31,419
Take that window.

1758
02:05:31,753 --> 02:05:33,087
Watch Joe.

1759
02:05:51,190 --> 02:05:52,358
Burdette!

1760
02:05:55,694 --> 02:05:57,029
Burdette!

1761
02:05:57,446 --> 02:05:59,156
Nathan Burdette!

1762
02:06:04,870 --> 02:06:06,038
We're ready.

1763
02:06:06,205 --> 02:06:07,539
Joe's here.

1764
02:06:07,957 --> 02:06:09,583
We're ready, too.

1765
02:06:10,709 --> 02:06:11,919
Start Dude.

1766
02:06:12,795 --> 02:06:14,546
I'll start Joe.

1767
02:06:14,630 --> 02:06:15,881
Go ahead.

1768
02:06:20,135 --> 02:06:21,679
All right, Joe.

1769
02:06:25,307 --> 02:06:27,602
You can start walking very slow.

1770
02:06:29,312 --> 02:06:31,439
And stop if I say stop...

1771
02:06:32,816 --> 02:06:34,276
...or I'll stop you.

1772
02:06:35,235 --> 02:06:36,486
Bring him out.

1773
02:06:41,491 --> 02:06:42,742
Go ahead.

1774
02:06:43,576 --> 02:06:44,619
Slow.

1775
02:07:26,454 --> 02:07:27,538
Look out!

1776
02:07:44,805 --> 02:07:46,807
Do you want me to go help Dude?

1777
02:07:46,974 --> 02:07:48,685
He'll take Joe all right.

1778
02:07:50,646 --> 02:07:52,856
He's got a strange way of doing it.

1779
02:07:53,565 --> 02:07:54,566
He'll take him.

1780
02:08:00,572 --> 02:08:02,157
You're right. He did.

1781
02:08:03,325 --> 02:08:06,286
Hey, Chance, I got Joe.

1782
02:08:06,995 --> 02:08:08,914
He can't walk, but I can drag him.

1783
02:08:08,997 --> 02:08:10,832
Stay right where you are.

1784
02:08:10,999 --> 02:08:12,334
We'll throw you a gun.

1785
02:08:12,417 --> 02:08:13,919
I'll do it. I'm closer.

1786
02:08:25,597 --> 02:08:29,269
Wait till we start shooting, Dude,
then make a grab for it.

1787
02:08:30,103 --> 02:08:32,355
Let's make a little noise, Colorado.

1788
02:09:05,471 --> 02:09:06,931
That ought to start something.

1789
02:09:08,224 --> 02:09:09,268
It will.

1790
02:09:12,146 --> 02:09:13,397
On your left!

1791
02:09:17,234 --> 02:09:19,069
Two of them made it to that shack.

1792
02:09:19,153 --> 02:09:21,697
If they get across that creek,
we'll be in bad shape.

1793
02:09:21,822 --> 02:09:23,115
They'll get behind us.

1794
02:09:23,240 --> 02:09:25,993
I don't know how
we're going to stop them from here.

1795
02:09:31,081 --> 02:09:32,541
Is that who I think it is?

1796
02:09:32,666 --> 02:09:33,834
Old Stumpy.

1797
02:09:34,335 --> 02:09:36,086
The fellow I left behind.

1798
02:09:37,671 --> 02:09:39,715
Don't shoot, it's me.

1799
02:09:39,840 --> 02:09:41,967
Carlos, what are you doing here?

1800
02:09:42,259 --> 02:09:45,054
I bring you some more shells.
You might need them.

1801
02:09:45,179 --> 02:09:46,513
Who'll turn up next?

1802
02:09:46,597 --> 02:09:48,975
Maybe the girl with another flowerpot.

1803
02:09:50,602 --> 02:09:54,606
Chance, Stumpy sitting in a bad place.
That wagon's got dynamite in it.

1804
02:09:55,523 --> 02:09:57,025
I go tell him.

1805
02:09:57,108 --> 02:09:59,361
You stay here. I'll go get him.

1806
02:09:59,444 --> 02:10:01,071
Give me those shells.

1807
02:10:27,305 --> 02:10:29,517
Stumpy, get out of there.

1808
02:10:30,059 --> 02:10:32,937
No. Come on, I got a front seat.
It's a good one.

1809
02:10:33,145 --> 02:10:34,730
You got a good seat, all right.

1810
02:10:34,814 --> 02:10:36,983
That's wagon's full of dynamite.

1811
02:10:37,149 --> 02:10:38,859
Jumping Jehoshaphat.

1812
02:10:39,318 --> 02:10:41,362
Why don't nobody never tell me nothing?

1813
02:10:41,487 --> 02:10:44,991
Get away from that wagon
or you won't be around to hear anything.

1814
02:11:02,758 --> 02:11:04,802
Stumpy, hurry up! What are you doing?

1815
02:11:04,927 --> 02:11:07,597
What do you think I'm doing?
Taking a siesta?

1816
02:11:09,015 --> 02:11:10,809
I brought us some dynamite.

1817
02:11:11,351 --> 02:11:12,811
That's a good idea.

1818
02:11:12,936 --> 02:11:15,439
Let's get farther away from that wagon.

1819
02:11:19,192 --> 02:11:21,486
Can you shoot as good as you say you can?

1820
02:11:21,612 --> 02:11:24,072
- Can you throw?
- Near as far as you can shoot.

1821
02:11:24,197 --> 02:11:26,325
We'll find out. Get that box open.

1822
02:11:30,537 --> 02:11:31,413
Dude!

1823
02:11:32,623 --> 02:11:34,041
Over here.

1824
02:11:34,875 --> 02:11:36,001
Get ready.

1825
02:11:36,209 --> 02:11:37,544
Let it go!

1826
02:11:44,217 --> 02:11:45,761
That was a good one.

1827
02:11:46,803 --> 02:11:48,305
Stop cackling.

1828
02:11:48,805 --> 02:11:51,017
Get one a little farther out there.

1829
02:11:51,142 --> 02:11:52,644
There you go again.

1830
02:11:53,394 --> 02:11:56,147
What would you do
if I wasn't throwing them for you?

1831
02:11:56,230 --> 02:11:57,482
I'd throw them myself.

1832
02:11:57,565 --> 02:12:00,068
Yeah, I guess you would at that.
You ready?

1833
02:12:00,234 --> 02:12:01,527
Let it go.

1834
02:12:06,908 --> 02:12:09,369
Dude, how do you like them apples?

1835
02:12:09,744 --> 02:12:10,995
That's all right.

1836
02:12:11,079 --> 02:12:12,538
Throw one for me.

1837
02:12:12,830 --> 02:12:14,832
Go ahead, but throw it harder this time.

1838
02:12:14,916 --> 02:12:17,251
There you go again.
You never can satisfy you.

1839
02:12:17,335 --> 02:12:18,503
Throw it.

1840
02:12:18,586 --> 02:12:20,088
Here you are, Dude.

1841
02:12:26,261 --> 02:12:27,762
Took you two.

1842
02:12:28,012 --> 02:12:29,681
I didn't allow for the wind.

1843
02:12:29,764 --> 02:12:32,101
Can't you throw them any farther?

1844
02:12:32,184 --> 02:12:34,520
I can if you want to blow
the whole place down.

1845
02:12:34,687 --> 02:12:37,523
That's the general idea. Throw it!

1846
02:12:46,448 --> 02:12:48,534
Don't shoot. We've had enough.

1847
02:12:48,701 --> 02:12:50,953
That got them.
That took the fight out of them.

1848
02:12:51,036 --> 02:12:51,996
Look at them quit.

1849
02:13:08,804 --> 02:13:10,598
Sure is quiet out there.

1850
02:13:10,806 --> 02:13:11,891
Find anything?

1851
02:13:11,975 --> 02:13:16,062
There isn't a Burdette man left
in town outside those who got locked up.

1852
02:13:16,146 --> 02:13:18,857
Rest of them all cleared out.
We won't have any trouble.

1853
02:13:18,982 --> 02:13:20,066
You're welcome.

1854
02:13:20,150 --> 02:13:21,318
Thank you.

1855
02:13:22,652 --> 02:13:24,362
What do you want to do about them?

1856
02:13:24,487 --> 02:13:27,073
Want to take them to Presidio
or wait for the marshal?

1857
02:13:27,157 --> 02:13:29,868
- We'll wait for the marshal.
- Wait for the marshal?

1858
02:13:29,993 --> 02:13:33,622
I'm glad you agree, since you have
to cook for them and watch them.

1859
02:13:33,747 --> 02:13:36,791
That ain't the way I said it.
I said, "Wait for the marshal?"

1860
02:13:36,916 --> 02:13:38,126
And that's a question.

1861
02:13:38,251 --> 02:13:40,837
I'm fed up feeding them,
and I ain't going to watch them.

1862
02:13:41,004 --> 02:13:44,007
I've been sitting back there so long
in the dark that I feel...

1863
02:13:44,090 --> 02:13:46,635
...like a gopher or a burrowing owl
or something.

1864
02:13:46,760 --> 02:13:49,429
When I went outside,
couldn't hardly see in the daylight.

1865
02:13:49,512 --> 02:13:51,556
I'll watch it for you if you want to go out.

1866
02:13:51,682 --> 02:13:53,309
- Would you?
- Sure.

1867
02:13:53,434 --> 02:13:56,938
I guess it's dark enough I can go outside,
it wouldn't hurt my eyes none.

1868
02:13:57,021 --> 02:13:58,439
I don't think it would.

1869
02:13:58,522 --> 02:14:02,360
Maybe get myself slicked up a smidge and
have a drink, it wouldn't hurt me either.

1870
02:14:02,443 --> 02:14:04,153
I don't think it would.

1871
02:14:05,112 --> 02:14:06,364
Should I go?

1872
02:14:06,614 --> 02:14:07,657
Go ahead.

1873
02:14:08,199 --> 02:14:08,950
Go ahead.

1874
02:14:09,033 --> 02:14:11,118
- You ain't going to give me a argument?
- No.

1875
02:14:11,202 --> 02:14:13,245
Don't care whether I go or not.

1876
02:14:25,967 --> 02:14:27,009
Chance.

1877
02:14:28,052 --> 02:14:30,012
Have you seen that girl yet?

1878
02:14:30,805 --> 02:14:33,225
I said, "Have you seen that girl yet?"

1879
02:14:35,978 --> 02:14:37,020
The job.

1880
02:14:38,146 --> 02:14:39,564
Didn't have time.

1881
02:14:40,816 --> 02:14:43,902
The Fort Worth stage is in.
They run at night.

1882
02:14:44,319 --> 02:14:45,654
Should be leaving soon.

1883
02:14:45,737 --> 02:14:47,990
- You mean she's going on it?
- I don't know.

1884
02:14:48,073 --> 02:14:50,075
I don't think you do either.

1885
02:14:50,158 --> 02:14:52,160
But if it was me, I'd find out.

1886
02:14:52,244 --> 02:14:54,871
I wouldn't walk around wondering about it.

1887
02:14:55,330 --> 02:14:57,749
She might be leaving and she might not.

1888
02:14:58,333 --> 02:15:00,377
She might need help making up her mind.

1889
02:15:00,502 --> 02:15:02,087
But you're the expert.

1890
02:15:02,170 --> 02:15:04,798
Me, I don't know anything about women.

1891
02:15:05,507 --> 02:15:08,760
Next thing you'll be telling me
you don't remember one.

1892
02:15:12,682 --> 02:15:14,183
A man forgets.

1893
02:15:18,605 --> 02:15:20,607
Sometimes it isn't easy.

1894
02:15:22,609 --> 02:15:25,653
Something happens, he just forgets.

1895
02:15:27,280 --> 02:15:30,533
In case you're interested, I have.

1896
02:15:31,451 --> 02:15:33,202
I don't even want a drink.

1897
02:15:34,370 --> 02:15:35,705
It's about time.

1898
02:15:36,289 --> 02:15:38,875
I was getting awful tired
of taking care of you.

1899
02:15:38,958 --> 02:15:41,961
If you want to jump in, I'll take care of you.

1900
02:15:42,795 --> 02:15:45,089
What is this now?
You're going to take care of him.

1901
02:15:45,214 --> 02:15:47,634
- Tell me about it.
- Sheriff's got himself a girl.

1902
02:15:47,717 --> 02:15:48,843
Shut up.

1903
02:15:48,968 --> 02:15:50,887
We ain't going to go through that again?

1904
02:15:50,970 --> 02:15:53,223
You going to do
the same thing Dude done?

1905
02:15:53,307 --> 02:15:56,060
- Keep still.
- Why don't somebody tell me these things?

1906
02:15:56,143 --> 02:15:57,603
Where you going?

1907
02:15:57,728 --> 02:15:59,188
Let him go, Stumpy.

1908
02:16:01,482 --> 02:16:03,776
No fooling,
has the sheriff got himself a girl?

1909
02:16:03,901 --> 02:16:06,278
I think so, but he doesn't know it yet.

1910
02:16:06,403 --> 02:16:09,114
- She got him on the run?
- She sure has.

1911
02:16:10,074 --> 02:16:11,492
I can just see him.

1912
02:16:11,575 --> 02:16:13,577
Laying down the law to her.

1913
02:16:13,661 --> 02:16:16,080
"I told you to get back in there!"

1914
02:16:16,997 --> 02:16:19,500
And then getting told off himself.

1915
02:16:25,673 --> 02:16:28,258
Everything is all right?

1916
02:16:28,342 --> 02:16:30,844
- I am so happy.
- Thank you, Consuelo.

1917
02:16:30,928 --> 02:16:32,471
You look for the girl?

1918
02:16:32,596 --> 02:16:33,848
She's in there.

1919
02:16:34,683 --> 02:16:37,018
"No got time."

1920
02:16:43,858 --> 02:16:45,193
Hi, John T.

1921
02:16:45,944 --> 02:16:48,655
Just a second while I get my shoe tied.

1922
02:16:51,116 --> 02:16:52,242
There.

1923
02:16:55,287 --> 02:16:57,330
It's all over, isn't it, John T.?

1924
02:16:57,455 --> 02:16:59,416
Where'd you get those things?

1925
02:17:00,208 --> 02:17:02,460
I wore them the last place I worked.

1926
02:17:03,962 --> 02:17:06,131
Why are you wearing them now?

1927
02:17:06,965 --> 02:17:08,466
Tonight's a big night.

1928
02:17:08,550 --> 02:17:11,011
Consuelo thought
a little entertainment might help.

1929
02:17:11,136 --> 02:17:12,470
I'm going to do a song.

1930
02:17:12,554 --> 02:17:14,890
You need a rig like that to sing?

1931
02:17:15,224 --> 02:17:16,767
You haven't heard me sing.

1932
02:17:16,892 --> 02:17:20,730
My legs aren't so bad.
Consuelo thought these tights might help.

1933
02:17:21,897 --> 02:17:23,316
But you don't like them.

1934
02:17:23,399 --> 02:17:26,611
- I didn't say that.
- You don't want me to wear them.

1935
02:17:26,736 --> 02:17:28,237
I didn't say that either.

1936
02:17:28,321 --> 02:17:32,199
- Is it because they show so much of me?
- They certainly do that.

1937
02:17:34,243 --> 02:17:37,413
You're a stubborn man, John T.

1938
02:17:39,165 --> 02:17:41,500
Sometimes I know what you're thinking.

1939
02:17:42,251 --> 02:17:43,919
And other times...

1940
02:17:44,920 --> 02:17:48,090
You just can't make up
your mind about me, can you?

1941
02:17:48,257 --> 02:17:49,759
You like what you see.

1942
02:17:49,842 --> 02:17:52,762
You like kissing me.
You like what you touch.

1943
02:17:53,429 --> 02:17:56,850
But you decided in the beginning
what kind of a girl I was.

1944
02:17:57,935 --> 02:17:59,770
And I haven't helped much.

1945
02:18:00,938 --> 02:18:03,190
I wore these before I met you.

1946
02:18:03,440 --> 02:18:05,150
I wanted you to know it.

1947
02:18:05,692 --> 02:18:08,362
To know what kind of a girl
you were getting.

1948
02:18:08,946 --> 02:18:13,575
I wanted you to get that funny look
on your face and tell me not to wear them.

1949
02:18:14,284 --> 02:18:15,786
But it didn't work.

1950
02:18:16,453 --> 02:18:18,121
You didn't even get mad.

1951
02:18:21,708 --> 02:18:24,628
I told you once
you wouldn't have to say anything.

1952
02:18:25,295 --> 02:18:28,590
That I'd know, but I don't know.

1953
02:18:30,217 --> 02:18:32,386
So, you're going to have to talk.

1954
02:18:33,387 --> 02:18:36,307
I'm hard to get, John T.

1955
02:18:36,391 --> 02:18:38,434
You're going to have to say you want me.

1956
02:18:38,559 --> 02:18:41,145
- Where're you going?
- Downstairs.

1957
02:18:41,229 --> 02:18:42,689
You'd better not.

1958
02:18:43,314 --> 02:18:45,108
Why had I better not?

1959
02:18:45,316 --> 02:18:46,818
Because I'm still sheriff.

1960
02:18:46,901 --> 02:18:49,821
You wear those things in public,
I'll arrest you.

1961
02:18:54,158 --> 02:18:55,326
John T.

1962
02:18:57,829 --> 02:19:00,540
I've waited so long for you to say that.

1963
02:19:01,249 --> 02:19:02,792
I thought you were never...

1964
02:19:02,917 --> 02:19:05,128
You have the funniest way
of saying things.

1965
02:19:05,253 --> 02:19:07,505
Just when I think
you're going to say one thing...

1966
02:19:07,588 --> 02:19:10,758
Get those darn things off. I'll wait outside.

1967
02:19:10,842 --> 02:19:14,012
No, you don't have to go.
I can use this screen.

1968
02:19:14,846 --> 02:19:17,224
Besides I want you to stay here...

1969
02:19:17,349 --> 02:19:19,893
...because the other thing is all over now,
isn't it?

1970
02:19:20,019 --> 02:19:22,354
I'm trying to hurry, but I'm all thumbs.

1971
02:19:23,022 --> 02:19:24,940
What I had to go through!

1972
02:19:25,357 --> 02:19:28,819
Put on these tights,
ask a lot of questions...

1973
02:19:28,944 --> 02:19:32,448
...start to walk out.
I thought you were never going to say it.

1974
02:19:32,531 --> 02:19:33,574
Say what?

1975
02:19:33,699 --> 02:19:35,326
That you loved me.

1976
02:19:35,451 --> 02:19:37,286
I said I'd arrest you.

1977
02:19:37,536 --> 02:19:41,165
It means the same thing, you know that.
You just won't say it.

1978
02:19:41,540 --> 02:19:44,460
We're different.
I'll have to get used to you.

1979
02:19:44,543 --> 02:19:46,712
Me, I just talk all the time.

1980
02:19:46,795 --> 02:19:48,672
You most certainly do.

1981
02:19:48,797 --> 02:19:51,592
You'll get used to that. You'll have to.

1982
02:19:51,717 --> 02:19:54,053
Either that or start talking, too.

1983
02:19:56,389 --> 02:19:58,016
Tell me something.

1984
02:19:58,308 --> 02:20:02,228
These tights, now why didn't you
want me to wear them?

1985
02:20:02,729 --> 02:20:05,982
Because I didn't want anybody
but me to see you in them.

1986
02:20:06,232 --> 02:20:07,609
I like that.

1987
02:20:08,068 --> 02:20:10,111
You're getting better already.

1988
02:20:10,904 --> 02:20:13,573
Shall I save them
and wear them just for you?

1989
02:20:28,254 --> 02:20:32,926
- Do you think I'll ever get to be a sheriff?
- Not unless you mind your own business.

1990
02:20:56,450 --> 02:21:00,037
