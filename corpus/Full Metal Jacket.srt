1
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:38,932
I am Gunnery Sergeant Hartman,
your senior drill instructor.

2
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:42,186
From now on,
you will speak only when spoken to...

3
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:45,939
...and the first and last words
out of your filthy sewers will be "sir."

4
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:47,983
Do you maggots understand that?

5
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,359
Sir, yes, sir.

6
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:52,863
Bullshit. I can't hear you.
Sound off like you got a pair.

7
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:54,406
Sir, yes, sir.

8
00:01:54,573 --> 00:01:58,911
If you ladies leave my island,
if you survive recruit training...

9
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:00,412
...you will be a weapon.

10
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:03,624
You will be a minister of death
praying for war.

11
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,585
But until that day, you are pukes.

12
00:02:06,752 --> 00:02:09,129
You are the lowest form of life on Earth.

13
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:11,673
You are not even human-fucking-beings.

14
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,720
You are nothing but unorganized,
grabasstic pieces of amphibian shit.

15
00:02:16,929 --> 00:02:19,765
Because I am hard, you will not like me.

16
00:02:19,932 --> 00:02:22,643
But the more you hate me,
the more you will learn.

17
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,895
I am hard but I am fair.

18
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:27,356
There is no racial bigotry here.

19
00:02:27,523 --> 00:02:31,652
I do not look down on niggers,
kikes, wops or greasers.

20
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:34,321
Here, you are all equally worthless.

21
00:02:34,446 --> 00:02:37,449
And my orders are to weed out
all non-hackers...

22
00:02:37,616 --> 00:02:40,452
...who do not pack the gear
to serve in my beloved Corps.

23
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:42,621
Do you maggots understand that?

24
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:44,039
Sir, yes, sir.

25
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:45,958
Bullshit. I can't hear you.

26
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:48,085
Sir, yes, sir!

27
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:51,547
- What's your name, scumbag?
- Sir, Private Brown, sir!

28
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,258
Bullshit. From now on
you're Private Snowball.

29
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:56,802
- Do you like that name?
- Sir, yes, sir!

30
00:02:56,969 --> 00:02:59,638
Well, there's one thing
that you won't like, Snowball:

31
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:01,974
They don't serve fried chicken
and watermelon...

32
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,268
...on a daily basis in my mess hall.

33
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:05,936
Sir, yes, sir!

34
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:09,648
Is that you, John Wayne? Is this me?

35
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:11,525
Who said that?

36
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:13,652
Who the fuck said that?

37
00:03:13,861 --> 00:03:17,281
Who's the slimy little communist-shit,
twinkle-toed cocksucker down here...

38
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:20,117
...who just signed
his own death warrant?

39
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,494
Nobody, huh?

40
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:26,331
The fairy-fucking-godmother said it.
Out-fucking-standing.

41
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,126
I will P. T. you all until you fucking die.

42
00:03:29,293 --> 00:03:32,045
I'll P. T. you until your assholes
are sucking buttermilk.

43
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:35,090
- Was it you, you scroungy little fuck?
- Sir, no, sir.

44
00:03:35,257 --> 00:03:38,468
You piece of shit. You look
like a fucking worm. I'll bet it was you.

45
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:41,972
- Sir, no, sir.
- Sir, I said it, sir.

46
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:45,851
Well, no shit.

47
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:49,396
What have we got here?
A fucking comedian. Private Joker.

48
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:51,440
I admire your honesty.

49
00:03:51,607 --> 00:03:55,068
Hell, I like you. You can come over
to my house and fuck my sister.

50
00:03:56,737 --> 00:04:00,949
You little scumbag.
I've got your name. I've got your ass.

51
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:03,160
You will not laugh. You will not cry.

52
00:04:03,327 --> 00:04:05,579
You will learn by the numbers.
I will teach you.

53
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:08,290
Now get up. Get on your feet.

54
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:13,212
You best unfuck yourself or I will unscrew
your head and shit down your neck.

55
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:16,715
- Sir, yes, sir.
- Private Joker, why did you join my Corps?

56
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:18,967
- Sir, to kill, sir.
- So you're a killer?

57
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:22,012
- Sir, yes, sir.
- Let me see your war face.

58
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:24,556
- Sir?
- You've got a war face?

59
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:29,603
That's a war face.
Now let me see your war face.

60
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:34,274
Bullshit. You didn't convince me.
Let me see your real war face.

61
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,069
You don't scare me. Work on it.

62
00:04:37,236 --> 00:04:38,820
Sir, yes, sir!

63
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:40,280
What's your excuse?

64
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:41,782
Sir, excuse for what, sir?

65
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,785
I'm asking the fucking questions, private.
Do you understand?

66
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:46,995
- Sir, yes, sir.
- Well, thank you very much.

67
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:49,748
- Can I be in charge for a while?
- Sir, yes, sir.

68
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:53,043
- Are you shook-up? Are you nervous?
- Sir, I am, sir.

69
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:55,295
- Do I make you nervous?
- Sir...

70
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:58,131
Sir what?
Were you about to call me an asshole?

71
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,634
- Sir, no, sir.
- How tall are you, private?

72
00:05:00,843 --> 00:05:02,302
Sir, 5'9", sir.

73
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:05,264
Five-foot-9. I didn't know
they stacked shit that high.

74
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,724
You trying to squeeze an inch
in on me somewhere?

75
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:10,894
- Sir, no, sir.
- Bullshit. It looks like the best part of you...

76
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:14,815
...ran down the crack of your mama's ass
and ended up as a stain on the mattress.

77
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:16,316
I think you've been cheated.

78
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:18,569
Where the hell are you from, private?

79
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:21,238
- Sir, Texas, sir.
- Holy dogshit. Texas?

80
00:05:21,405 --> 00:05:24,491
Only steers and queers
come from Texas, Private Cowboy.

81
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:28,161
And you don't much look like a steer to me,
so that kind of narrows it down.

82
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,330
- Do you suck dicks?
- Sir, no, sir.

83
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:32,791
- Are you a peter puffer?
- Sir, no, sir.

84
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:35,377
I'll bet you would fuck
a person in the ass...

85
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:39,173
...and not even have the goddamn common
courtesy to give him a reach around.

86
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:41,466
I'll be watching you.

87
00:05:43,135 --> 00:05:45,220
Did your parents have any children
that lived?

88
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:47,639
- Sir, yes, sir.
- I'll bet they regret that.

89
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:50,726
You're so ugly you could be
a modern-art masterpiece.

90
00:05:50,893 --> 00:05:53,520
- What's your name, fat-body?
- Sir, Leonard Lawrence, sir.

91
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:55,397
Lawrence? Lawrence what, of Arabia?

92
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:59,193
- Sir, no, sir.
- That name sounds like royalty. You royalty?

93
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,320
- Sir, no, sir.
- Do you suck dicks?

94
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:04,406
- Sir, no, sir.
- Bullshit. I'll bet you could suck a golf ball...

95
00:06:04,573 --> 00:06:06,533
-...through a garden hose.
- Sir, no, sir.

96
00:06:06,742 --> 00:06:08,160
I don't like the name Lawrence.

97
00:06:08,327 --> 00:06:10,454
Only faggots and sailors
are called Lawrence.

98
00:06:10,621 --> 00:06:13,248
- From now on you're Gomer Pyle.
- Sir, yes, sir.

99
00:06:13,457 --> 00:06:16,084
Do you think I'm cute, Private Pyle?
You think I'm funny?

100
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:19,379
- Sir, no, sir.
- Wipe that disgusting grin off your face.

101
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:21,423
Sir, yes, sir.

102
00:06:21,632 --> 00:06:23,759
Well, any-fucking-time, sweetheart.

103
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:27,596
- Sir, I'm trying, sir.
- Private Pyle, I'll give you three seconds...

104
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:29,890
...exactly three fucking seconds...

105
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:32,601
...to wipe that stupid-looking grin
off your face...

106
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:36,772
...or I will gouge out your eyeballs
and skull-fuck you.

107
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,483
One. Two. Three.

108
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:44,279
- Sir, I can't help it, sir.
- Bullshit. Get on your knees, scumbag.

109
00:06:45,781 --> 00:06:47,991
Now choke yourself.

110
00:06:49,201 --> 00:06:52,246
Goddamn it, with my hand, numb-nuts.

111
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:56,458
Don't pull my fucking hand over there.
I said, choke yourself.

112
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:59,461
Now lean forward and choke yourself.

113
00:07:02,381 --> 00:07:05,467
- Are you through grinning?
- Sir, yes, sir.

114
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:07,177
Bullshit. I can't hear you.

115
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,555
Sir, yes, sir.

116
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:13,559
Bullshit. I still can't hear you.
Sound off like you've got a pair.

117
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:15,519
Sir, yes, sir.

118
00:07:15,686 --> 00:07:18,605
That's enough. Get on your feet.

119
00:07:21,567 --> 00:07:26,154
Pyle, you had best square your ass away
and start shitting me Tiffany cuff links...

120
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:28,949
...or I will definitely fuck you up.

121
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:31,076
Sir, yes, sir.

122
00:07:32,244 --> 00:07:35,664
Left, right, left, right
left, right, left.

123
00:07:35,873 --> 00:07:38,208
Left, right, left, right, left.

124
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,002
Left, right, left, right, left...

125
00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:42,796
Parris Island, South Carolina...

126
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:46,216
...the United States Marine Corps
Recruit Depot.

127
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:50,012
An eight-week college
for the phony-tough and the crazy-brave.

128
00:07:50,179 --> 00:07:53,015
Mama and Papa were laying in bed

129
00:07:53,182 --> 00:07:55,934
Mama and Papa were laying in bed

130
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:58,937
Mama rolled over
And this is what she said

131
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:01,481
Mama rolled over, this is what she said

132
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:04,568
- Oh, give me some, give me some
- Oh, give me some, give me some

133
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:06,069
- P. T.
- P. T.

134
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:07,571
- P. T.
- P. T.

135
00:08:07,738 --> 00:08:09,072
- Good for you
- Good for you

136
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:10,699
- And good for me
- And good for me

137
00:08:10,866 --> 00:08:12,159
- Good
- Good

138
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:15,078
Up in the morning to the rising sun

139
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:17,706
Up in the morning to the rising sun

140
00:08:17,915 --> 00:08:20,667
Gonna run all day till the running's done

141
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:23,962
Gonna run all day till the running's done

142
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:26,965
Ho Chi Minh is a son of a bitch

143
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:29,551
Ho Chi Minh is a son of a bitch

144
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,638
Got the blue balls, crabs
And the seven-year itch

145
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:35,891
Got the blue balls, crabs
And the seven-year itch

146
00:08:36,058 --> 00:08:39,603
Left, right, left, right, left.

147
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:42,689
Your left shoulder.

148
00:08:43,607 --> 00:08:46,735
Left, right, left. Port.

149
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:51,698
Left, right. Attack. Halt.

150
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:55,577
Left shoulder.

151
00:08:58,664 --> 00:09:01,416
Private Pyle, what are you trying to do
to my beloved Corps?

152
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:04,127
- Sir, I don't know, sir.
- You are dumb, Private Pyle...

153
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:07,548
...but do you expect me to believe
that you don't know left from right?

154
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:10,092
- Sir, no, sir.
- Then you did that on purpose.

155
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:13,136
- You wanna be different.
- Sir, no, sir.

156
00:09:13,345 --> 00:09:16,223
- What side was that, Private Pyle?
- Sir, left side, sir.

157
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:19,935
- Are you sure, Private Pyle?
- Sir, yes, sir.

158
00:09:20,102 --> 00:09:23,647
- What side was that, Private Pyle?
- Sir, right side, sir.

159
00:09:23,856 --> 00:09:26,191
Don't fuck with me again, Pyle.

160
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:27,985
Pick up your fucking cover.

161
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:29,403
Sir, yes, sir.

162
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:32,406
Your left shoulder.

163
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:36,660
Left, right, left. Port.

164
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,706
Left shoulder.

165
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:45,169
Your right shoulder.

166
00:09:46,587 --> 00:09:51,341
Left, right, left, right.
Your left shoulder.

167
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:55,262
Left, two, three, four.

168
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:57,973
Your right shoulder.

169
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:04,730
Tonight you pukes will sleep
with your rifles.

170
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:08,400
You will give your rifle a girl's name.

171
00:10:08,609 --> 00:10:13,780
Because this is the only pussy
you people are going to get.

172
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:18,410
Your days of finger-banging
old Mary Jane Rottencrotch...

173
00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:22,748
...through her purty pink panties
are over.

174
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:25,000
You're married to this piece.

175
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:27,836
This weapon of iron and wood.

176
00:10:28,003 --> 00:10:31,215
And you will be faithful.

177
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:33,759
Arms.

178
00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:38,138
Prepare to mount.

179
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,644
Mount.

180
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:50,025
Port.

181
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:56,114
Pray.

182
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:58,825
This is my rifle.

183
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:02,496
There are many like it,
but this one is mine.

184
00:11:02,663 --> 00:11:05,332
My rifle is my best friend.

185
00:11:05,499 --> 00:11:07,167
It is my life.

186
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:11,630
I must master it
as I must master my life.

187
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,800
Without me, my rifle is useless.

188
00:11:14,967 --> 00:11:17,803
Without my rifle, I am useless.

189
00:11:18,095 --> 00:11:20,848
I must fire my rifle true.

190
00:11:21,056 --> 00:11:25,060
I must shoot straighter than my enemy,
who is trying to kill me.

191
00:11:25,227 --> 00:11:28,188
I must shoot him before he shoots me.

192
00:11:28,397 --> 00:11:29,898
I will.

193
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:32,734
Before God, I swear this creed.

194
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:36,613
My rifle and myself are defenders
of my country.

195
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:39,032
We are the masters of our enemy.

196
00:11:39,241 --> 00:11:41,702
We are the saviors of my life.

197
00:11:41,869 --> 00:11:46,081
So be it until there is no enemy,
but peace.

198
00:11:46,248 --> 00:11:47,958
Amen.

199
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:50,294
Arm.

200
00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:55,757
At ease.

201
00:11:56,675 --> 00:11:58,177
Good night, ladies.

202
00:11:58,302 --> 00:12:00,971
Good night, sir.

203
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:03,932
- Hit it, sweetheart.
- Sir, aye, aye, sir.

204
00:12:04,433 --> 00:12:07,269
Right shoulder.

205
00:12:11,273 --> 00:12:15,027
That is not
your daddy's shotgun, Cowboy.

206
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:19,448
Left shoulder.

207
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:27,080
Move the rifle around your head,
not your head around the rifle.

208
00:12:28,999 --> 00:12:30,792
Port.

209
00:12:33,045 --> 00:12:37,591
Four inches from your chest, Pyle.
Four inches.

210
00:12:38,175 --> 00:12:40,761
This is my rifle, this is my gun

211
00:12:40,928 --> 00:12:43,430
This is for fighting, this is for fun

212
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:46,016
This is my rifle, this is my gun

213
00:12:46,183 --> 00:12:48,602
This is for fighting, this is for fun

214
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:51,271
This is my rifle, this is my gun

215
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:53,857
This is for fighting, this is for fun

216
00:12:54,024 --> 00:12:56,443
This is my rifle, this is my gun

217
00:12:56,652 --> 00:12:59,071
This is for fighting, this is for fun

218
00:12:59,238 --> 00:13:01,615
This is my rifle, this is my gun

219
00:13:01,782 --> 00:13:04,535
This is for fighting, this is for fun

220
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:11,458
You ' re bouncing.

221
00:13:27,224 --> 00:13:28,517
T en fucking seconds.

222
00:13:28,684 --> 00:13:33,522
It should take you no less than 10
fucking seconds to negotiate this obstacle.

223
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:35,190
Quickly, move it out.

224
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:39,027
There ain't one swinging-dick private
in this platoon's gonna graduate...

225
00:13:39,194 --> 00:13:43,448
...until they can get this obstacle down
to less than 10 fucking seconds.

226
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:08,932
Next two privates. Quickly.

227
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:11,894
Get over that goddamn obstacle. Move it.

228
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,104
Next two privates. Quickly.

229
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,647
Hurry up. Get up there.

230
00:14:15,814 --> 00:14:18,525
- Private Joker, are you a killer?
- Sir, yes, sir.

231
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:20,569
Let me hear your war cry.

232
00:14:21,737 --> 00:14:24,448
Next two privates, go. Quickly.

233
00:14:24,615 --> 00:14:26,742
Get your fat ass over there, Private Pyle.

234
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:28,660
Oh, that's right, Private Pyle.

235
00:14:28,827 --> 00:14:32,748
Don't make any fucking effort
to get up to the top of the fucking obstacle.

236
00:14:32,915 --> 00:14:37,419
If God wanted you up there, he would have
miracled your ass up by now, wouldn't he?

237
00:14:37,586 --> 00:14:40,297
- Sir, yes, sir.
- Get your fat ass up there, Pyle.

238
00:14:40,506 --> 00:14:42,674
- Sir, yes, sir.
- What is the matter with you?

239
00:14:42,841 --> 00:14:47,054
I'll bet if there was some pussy up there on
top of that obstacle, you could get up there.

240
00:14:47,221 --> 00:14:48,931
- Couldn't you?
- Sir, yes, sir.

241
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:53,310
Your ass looks like about 150 pounds
of chewed bubble gum. Do you know that?

242
00:14:53,477 --> 00:14:54,895
Sir, yes, sir.

243
00:14:57,314 --> 00:14:59,650
One for the commandant.

244
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:02,819
One for the Corps.

245
00:15:03,529 --> 00:15:06,782
Get up there. Pull.

246
00:15:07,366 --> 00:15:10,661
I guess the Corps don't get theirs.
Get up there, Pyle.

247
00:15:10,828 --> 00:15:13,831
Pull. Pull, Pyle, pull.

248
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:16,542
One pull-up, Pyle. Come on, pull.

249
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:20,337
You gotta be shitting me, Pyle.
Get your ass up there.

250
00:15:20,504 --> 00:15:24,174
Do you mean to tell me that you cannot
do one single pull-up?

251
00:15:24,341 --> 00:15:28,679
You are a worthless piece of shit, Pyle.
Get out of my face.

252
00:15:28,887 --> 00:15:30,848
Get up there, Snowball.

253
00:15:31,974 --> 00:15:33,684
Get up here, fat-boy.

254
00:15:33,851 --> 00:15:37,104
Quickly. Move it up.
Move it up, Pyle. Move it up.

255
00:15:37,271 --> 00:15:41,483
You climb obstacles like old people fuck.
Do you know that, Private Pyle?

256
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:44,945
Get up here. You're too slow.
Move it. Move it.

257
00:15:45,112 --> 00:15:48,657
Private Pyle, whatever you do,
don't fall down.

258
00:15:48,824 --> 00:15:51,034
That would break my fucking heart.

259
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:54,663
Quickly. Up and over. Up and over.

260
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:58,375
Well, what in the fuck are you waiting for,
Private Pyle?

261
00:15:58,542 --> 00:16:02,254
Get up and over.
Move it, move it, move it.

262
00:16:02,421 --> 00:16:04,965
Are you quitting on me?

263
00:16:05,132 --> 00:16:07,176
Well, are you?

264
00:16:07,342 --> 00:16:11,638
Then quit, you slimy fucking
walrus-looking piece of shit.

265
00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:14,308
Get the fuck off of my obstacle.

266
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:17,227
Get the fuck down off of my obstacle.

267
00:16:17,394 --> 00:16:19,605
Now. Move it.

268
00:16:19,771 --> 00:16:25,110
I'm gonna rip your balls off so you
cannot contaminate the rest of the world.

269
00:16:25,319 --> 00:16:27,946
I will motivate you, Private Pyle...

270
00:16:28,113 --> 00:16:32,701
...if it short-dicks every cannibal
on the Congo.

271
00:16:33,702 --> 00:16:36,288
Pick them up and set them down, Pyle.

272
00:16:36,497 --> 00:16:38,540
Quickly. Move it out.

273
00:16:38,707 --> 00:16:43,295
Were you born a fat, slimy,
scumbag puke piece of shit, Private Pyle?

274
00:16:43,504 --> 00:16:45,797
Or did you have to work on it?

275
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:49,593
Move it up. Quickly. Hustle up.

276
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:54,306
The fucking war will be over by the time
we get out there, won't it, Private Pyle?

277
00:16:54,515 --> 00:16:56,058
Move it.

278
00:16:56,225 --> 00:17:00,395
Are you going to fucking die, Pyle?
Are you going to die on me?

279
00:17:00,562 --> 00:17:02,606
Do it now.

280
00:17:02,773 --> 00:17:06,235
Move it up. Hustle it up.
Quickly, quickly, quickly.

281
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:09,863
Do you feel dizzy?

282
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:12,366
Do you feel faint?

283
00:17:13,116 --> 00:17:18,080
Jesus H. Christ,
I think you've got a hard-on.

284
00:17:19,748 --> 00:17:23,710
Quickly, ladies. Assholes and elbows.
Move it out.

285
00:17:23,877 --> 00:17:25,420
Get up here.

286
00:17:25,587 --> 00:17:29,258
Move it. Move it, move it, move it.

287
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:31,385
Quickly.

288
00:17:31,552 --> 00:17:35,347
Quickly. Get up here.
Hurry up. Move it out.

289
00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:51,613
Reveille. Reveille. Reveille.

290
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,657
Drop your cocks and grab your socks.

291
00:17:53,824 --> 00:17:56,702
Today is Sunday.
Divine worship at 0800.

292
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:59,288
Get your bunks made
and get your uniforms on.

293
00:17:59,454 --> 00:18:02,374
Police call will commence
in two minutes.

294
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:03,959
Private Cowboy, Private Joker.

295
00:18:04,126 --> 00:18:05,711
- Sir, yes, sir.
- Sir, yes, sir.

296
00:18:05,878 --> 00:18:09,423
As soon as you finish your bunks,
I want you two turds to clean the head.

297
00:18:09,631 --> 00:18:12,676
- Sir, aye, aye, sir.
- I want that head so sanitary...

298
00:18:12,843 --> 00:18:16,930
...that the Virgin Mary herself would be
proud to go in there and take a dump.

299
00:18:17,097 --> 00:18:18,432
- Sir, yes, sir.
- Sir, yes, sir.

300
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,851
Private Joker, do you believe
in the Virgin Mary?

301
00:18:21,018 --> 00:18:22,811
Sir, no, sir.

302
00:18:26,023 --> 00:18:29,693
Well, Private Joker,
I don't believe I heard you correctly.

303
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:32,070
Sir, the private said, " No, sir," sir.

304
00:18:32,237 --> 00:18:35,407
Why, you little maggot.
You make me wanna vomit.

305
00:18:35,574 --> 00:18:39,745
You goddamn communist heathen.
Sound off that you love the Virgin Mary...

306
00:18:39,912 --> 00:18:42,122
...or I'm gonna stomp your guts out.

307
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:44,625
Now, you do love the Virgin Mary,
don't you?

308
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:46,043
Sir, negative, sir.

309
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:48,712
Private Joker,
are you trying to offend me?

310
00:18:48,879 --> 00:18:50,214
Sir, negative, sir.

311
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:53,467
Sir, the private believes that
any answer he gives will be wrong...

312
00:18:53,634 --> 00:18:57,513
...and the senior drill instructor will
beat him harder if he reverses himself, sir.

313
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,264
Who's your squad leader, scumbag?

314
00:18:59,431 --> 00:19:02,267
Sir, the private's squad leader
is Private Snowball, sir.

315
00:19:02,434 --> 00:19:04,311
Private Snowball.

316
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:07,147
Sir, Private Snowball
reporting as ordered, sir.

317
00:19:07,314 --> 00:19:10,984
Private Snowball, you're fired.
Private Joker is promoted to squad leader.

318
00:19:11,193 --> 00:19:13,612
- Sir, aye, aye, sir.
- Disappear, scumbag.

319
00:19:13,779 --> 00:19:16,532
- Sir, aye, aye, sir.
- Private Pyle.

320
00:19:16,698 --> 00:19:19,618
- Sir, Private Pyle reporting as ordered, sir.
- From now on...

321
00:19:19,785 --> 00:19:23,080
...Private Joker is your new squad leader
and you will bunk with him.

322
00:19:23,247 --> 00:19:24,540
He'll teach you everything.

323
00:19:24,706 --> 00:19:26,917
- He'll teach you how to pee.
- Sir, yes, sir.

324
00:19:27,084 --> 00:19:31,171
Private Joker is silly and he's ignorant,
but he's got guts and guts is enough.

325
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,090
Now, you ladies, carry on.

326
00:19:33,257 --> 00:19:35,467
Sir, aye, aye, sir.

327
00:19:41,932 --> 00:19:45,435
The bolt. The bolt goes in the receiver.

328
00:19:48,939 --> 00:19:51,191
Operating-rod handle.

329
00:19:51,358 --> 00:19:53,861
Operating-rod guide.

330
00:19:54,278 --> 00:19:57,489
And the left one over the right.

331
00:19:57,656 --> 00:19:59,741
Right one over the left.

332
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:04,413
Left one over the right.

333
00:20:04,621 --> 00:20:06,874
The right one over the left.

334
00:20:10,419 --> 00:20:12,671
Just throw your other leg over.

335
00:20:17,551 --> 00:20:19,178
Attaboy.

336
00:20:20,345 --> 00:20:25,225
That's it. Now just pull the next one over
and you're home free.

337
00:20:26,185 --> 00:20:27,769
Ready?

338
00:20:32,816 --> 00:20:34,776
Just throw it over.

339
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:43,410
Attaboy.

340
00:20:43,702 --> 00:20:45,537
Set it down.

341
00:20:48,373 --> 00:20:49,875
All right?

342
00:20:51,001 --> 00:20:52,920
There you go.

343
00:20:54,505 --> 00:20:56,715
Congratulations, Leonard.

344
00:20:56,882 --> 00:20:58,467
You did it.

345
00:20:59,343 --> 00:21:02,304
Fold the blanket
and the sheet back together.

346
00:21:02,471 --> 00:21:04,806
Make a four-inch fold.

347
00:21:05,516 --> 00:21:07,643
Okay? Got it?

348
00:21:07,851 --> 00:21:09,728
You do it.

349
00:21:11,563 --> 00:21:13,607
Right shoulder.

350
00:21:13,774 --> 00:21:15,859
Your left shoulder.

351
00:21:19,363 --> 00:21:21,031
Port.

352
00:21:25,577 --> 00:21:27,371
Order.

353
00:21:49,935 --> 00:21:52,896
Your right shoulder.

354
00:21:57,276 --> 00:21:58,902
Square these weapons away.

355
00:21:59,069 --> 00:22:01,905
My Corps' arms should be
parallel to the...

356
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:07,369
The deadliest weapon in the world...

357
00:22:07,536 --> 00:22:11,373
...is a Marine and his rifle.

358
00:22:11,582 --> 00:22:15,085
It is your killer instinct
which must be harnessed...

359
00:22:15,252 --> 00:22:19,298
...if you expect to survive in combat.

360
00:22:19,464 --> 00:22:23,010
Your rifle is only a tool.

361
00:22:23,177 --> 00:22:25,762
It is a hard heart that kills.

362
00:22:26,555 --> 00:22:31,393
If your killer instincts
are not clean and strong...

363
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:34,605
...you will hesitate
at the moment of truth.

364
00:22:34,771 --> 00:22:36,773
You will not kill.

365
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:39,318
You will become dead-Marine.

366
00:22:39,484 --> 00:22:42,821
And then you will be in a world of shit.

367
00:22:42,988 --> 00:22:44,698
Because Marines...

368
00:22:44,865 --> 00:22:48,452
...are not allowed to die
without permission.

369
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,329
Do you maggots understand?

370
00:22:50,496 --> 00:22:51,997
Sir, yes, sir.

371
00:22:53,582 --> 00:22:56,376
I love working for Uncle Sam

372
00:22:56,543 --> 00:22:59,338
I love working for Uncle Sam

373
00:22:59,505 --> 00:23:02,257
Lets me know just who I am

00:23:02,424 --> 00:23:05,219

386
00:23:32,454 --> 00:23:35,249

Trim them.

396
00:23:54,434 --> 00:23:56,228
T oe jam.

397
00:23:59,106 --> 00:24:00,941
Pop that blister.

398
00:24:09,616 --> 00:24:12,536
Jesus H. Christ.

399
00:24:13,453 --> 00:24:16,707
Private Pyle,
why is your footlocker unlocked?

400
00:24:16,874 --> 00:24:18,041
Sir, I don't know, sir.

401
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:21,670
Private Pyle, if there is one thing
in this world that I hate...

402
00:24:21,837 --> 00:24:25,132
...it is an unlocked footlocker.
You know that, don't you?

403
00:24:25,299 --> 00:24:27,885
- Sir, yes, sir.
- lf it wasn't for dickheads like you...

404
00:24:28,051 --> 00:24:30,596
...there wouldn't be thievery
in the world, would there?

405
00:24:30,804 --> 00:24:32,764
- Sir, no, sir.
- Get down.

406
00:24:37,144 --> 00:24:40,939
Well, now, let's just see
if there's anything missing.

407
00:24:43,567 --> 00:24:45,736
Holy Jesus.

408
00:24:45,903 --> 00:24:47,696
What is that?

409
00:24:47,863 --> 00:24:50,491
What the fuck is that?

410
00:24:50,657 --> 00:24:52,326
What is that, Private Pyle?

411
00:24:52,534 --> 00:24:53,785
Sir, a jelly doughnut, sir.

412
00:24:53,952 --> 00:24:56,330
- A jelly doughnut?
- Sir, yes, sir.

413
00:24:56,497 --> 00:24:59,541
- How did it get here?
- Sir, I took it from the mess hall, sir.

414
00:24:59,708 --> 00:25:01,835
Is chow allowed in the barracks,
Private Pyle?

415
00:25:02,044 --> 00:25:05,756
- Sir, no, sir.
- Are you allowed to eat jelly doughnuts?

416
00:25:05,923 --> 00:25:08,300
- Sir, no, sir.
- And why not, Private Pyle?

417
00:25:08,467 --> 00:25:10,135
Sir, because I'm too heavy, sir.

418
00:25:10,302 --> 00:25:15,349
- Because you are a disgusting fat-body.
- Sir, yes, sir.

419
00:25:15,516 --> 00:25:19,061
Then why did you hide a jelly doughnut
in your footlocker, Private Pyle?

420
00:25:19,228 --> 00:25:21,188
Sir, because I was hungry, sir.

421
00:25:21,396 --> 00:25:24,483
Because you were hungry.

422
00:25:27,903 --> 00:25:31,657
Private Pyle has dishonored himself...

423
00:25:31,865 --> 00:25:34,493
...and dishonored the platoon.

424
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:38,622
I have tried to help him,
but I have failed.

425
00:25:38,789 --> 00:25:43,710
I have failed
because you have not helped me.

426
00:25:43,877 --> 00:25:47,923
You people have not given Private Pyle...

427
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:50,300
...the proper motivation.

428
00:25:51,009 --> 00:25:55,973
So from now on,
whenever Private Pyle fucks up...

429
00:25:56,139 --> 00:25:58,433
...I will not punish him.

430
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,061
I will punish all of you.

431
00:26:01,228 --> 00:26:03,313
And the way I see it, ladies...

432
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,567
...you owe me for one jelly doughnut.

433
00:26:06,733 --> 00:26:09,444
Now get on your faces.

434
00:26:10,821 --> 00:26:12,573
Open your mouth.

435
00:26:12,739 --> 00:26:15,242
They're paying for it, you eat it.

436
00:26:15,409 --> 00:26:17,786
Ready, exercise.

437
00:26:17,953 --> 00:26:20,581
One, two, three, four

438
00:26:20,747 --> 00:26:23,250
I love the Marine Corps

439
00:26:23,417 --> 00:26:25,794
One, two, three, four

440
00:26:25,961 --> 00:26:28,338
I love the Marine Corps

441
00:26:28,505 --> 00:26:30,924
One, two, three, four

442
00:26:31,133 --> 00:26:33,468
I love the Marine Corps

443
00:26:33,635 --> 00:26:36,096
One, two, three, four

444
00:26:36,305 --> 00:26:38,640
I love the Marine Corps

445
00:26:38,807 --> 00:26:41,143
One, two, three, four...

446
00:26:42,436 --> 00:26:45,355
You really look like shit today, Leonard.

447
00:26:51,695 --> 00:26:53,447
Joker.

448
00:26:55,866 --> 00:26:58,619
Everybody hates me now.

449
00:27:01,163 --> 00:27:02,998
Even you.

450
00:27:06,043 --> 00:27:08,378
Nobody hates you, Leonard.

451
00:27:08,879 --> 00:27:11,048
You just keep making mistakes.

452
00:27:11,215 --> 00:27:13,509
Getting everybody in trouble.

453
00:27:16,428 --> 00:27:19,014
I can't do anything right.

454
00:27:21,517 --> 00:27:23,435
I need help.

455
00:27:27,022 --> 00:27:29,316
I'm trying to help you, Leonard.

456
00:27:31,068 --> 00:27:33,195
I'm really trying.

457
00:27:35,364 --> 00:27:37,491
Tuck your shirt in.

458
00:27:41,912 --> 00:27:43,872
One, two, three, 19.

459
00:27:44,081 --> 00:27:46,083
One, two, three, 20.

460
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:48,335
One, two, three, 21.

461
00:27:48,502 --> 00:27:50,546
One, two, three, 22.

462
00:27:50,712 --> 00:27:52,631
One, two, three, 23.

463
00:27:52,798 --> 00:27:54,842
One, two, three, 24.

464
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:57,010
One, two, three, 25.

465
00:27:57,177 --> 00:27:59,054
One, two, three, 26.

466
00:27:59,263 --> 00:28:01,265
One, two, three, 27.

467
00:28:01,473 --> 00:28:03,433
One, two, three, 28.

468
00:28:03,642 --> 00:28:05,561
One, two, three, 29.

469
00:28:05,727 --> 00:28:08,230
One, two, three, 30.

470
00:29:34,024 --> 00:29:35,526
Do it.

471
00:29:35,651 --> 00:29:36,902
Do it.

472
00:29:46,203 --> 00:29:49,373
Remember, it's just a bad dream, fat-boy.

473
00:30:17,651 --> 00:30:19,486
Port.

474
00:30:21,238 --> 00:30:23,740
Left shoulder.

475
00:30:25,993 --> 00:30:28,745
Right shoulder.

476
00:30:32,332 --> 00:30:33,917
Port.

477
00:30:37,004 --> 00:30:39,882
Do we love our beloved Corps, ladies?

478
00:30:40,048 --> 00:30:44,386
Semper fi, do or die.
Gung ho. Gung ho. Gung ho.

479
00:30:44,553 --> 00:30:46,680
What makes the grass grow?

480
00:30:46,972 --> 00:30:48,849
Blood, blood, blood.

481
00:30:49,016 --> 00:30:51,727
What do we do for a living, ladies?

482
00:30:51,894 --> 00:30:53,604
Kill, kill, kill.

483
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:55,355
I can't hear you.

484
00:30:55,522 --> 00:30:57,232
Kill, kill, kill.

485
00:30:57,399 --> 00:31:00,485
Bullshit. I still can't hear you.

486
00:31:00,652 --> 00:31:02,279
Kill, kill, kill.

487
00:31:03,197 --> 00:31:06,992
Do any of you people know
who Charles Whitman was?

488
00:31:08,494 --> 00:31:10,996
None of you dumb-asses knows?

489
00:31:11,663 --> 00:31:13,332
Private Cowboy.

490
00:31:13,499 --> 00:31:17,836
Sir, he was that guy who shot all those
people from that tower in Austin, Texas, sir.

491
00:31:18,045 --> 00:31:20,881
That's affirmative.
Charles Whitman killed 12 people...

492
00:31:21,048 --> 00:31:25,219
...from a 28-story observation tower
at the University of Texas.

493
00:31:25,427 --> 00:31:28,305
From distances of up to 400 yards.

494
00:31:29,056 --> 00:31:32,309
Anybody know
who Lee Harvey Oswald was?

495
00:31:32,476 --> 00:31:33,519
Private Snowball.

496
00:31:34,311 --> 00:31:36,063
Sir, he shot Kennedy, sir.

497
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:39,066
That's right.
And do you know how far away he was?

498
00:31:39,233 --> 00:31:43,529
Sir, he was pretty far.
From that book-suppository building, sir.

499
00:31:43,737 --> 00:31:45,697
All right, knock it off.

500
00:31:45,864 --> 00:31:47,741
Two hundred and fifty feet.

501
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:52,120
He was 250 feet away
and shooting at a moving target.

502
00:31:52,287 --> 00:31:57,918
Oswald got off three rounds with an old
ltalian bolt-action rifle in only six seconds...

503
00:31:58,085 --> 00:32:01,547
...and scored two hits,
including a head shot.

504
00:32:01,713 --> 00:32:05,884
Do any of you people know where
these individuals learned how to shoot?

505
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,428
Private Joker.

506
00:32:08,595 --> 00:32:10,514
Sir, in the Marines, sir.

507
00:32:10,681 --> 00:32:13,225
In the Marines. Outstanding.

508
00:32:13,392 --> 00:32:18,355
Those individuals showed what one
motivated Marine and his rifle can do.

509
00:32:18,522 --> 00:32:21,108
And before you ladies leave my island...

510
00:32:21,275 --> 00:32:24,611
...you will all be able
to do the same thing.

511
00:32:44,673 --> 00:32:46,341
Today...

512
00:32:46,508 --> 00:32:48,677
...is Christmas.

513
00:32:48,844 --> 00:32:54,057
There will be a magic show at 0930.

514
00:32:54,433 --> 00:32:57,978
Chaplain Charlie will tell you...

515
00:32:58,187 --> 00:33:02,733
...about how the free world
will conquer communism...

516
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:07,529
...with the aid of God and a few Marines.

517
00:33:08,071 --> 00:33:11,992
God has a hard-on for Marines...

518
00:33:12,201 --> 00:33:16,872
...because we kill everything we see.

519
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:19,416
He plays his games...

520
00:33:19,583 --> 00:33:22,294
...we play ours.

521
00:33:22,461 --> 00:33:27,341
To show our appreciation
for so much power...

522
00:33:27,508 --> 00:33:32,846
...we keep heaven packed
with fresh souls.

523
00:33:33,639 --> 00:33:37,601
God was here before the Marine Corps.

524
00:33:37,768 --> 00:33:40,771
So you can give your heart to Jesus...

525
00:33:40,938 --> 00:33:44,650
...but your ass belongs to the Corps.

526
00:33:44,816 --> 00:33:46,777
Do you ladies understand?

527
00:33:46,944 --> 00:33:49,947
- Sir, yes, sir.
- I can't hear you.

528
00:33:50,113 --> 00:33:51,949
Sir, yes, sir.

529
00:33:57,746 --> 00:34:01,041
It's been swabbed and brushed.

530
00:34:02,417 --> 00:34:04,211
Everything...

531
00:34:05,128 --> 00:34:06,964
...is clean.

532
00:34:10,843 --> 00:34:12,636
Beautiful.

533
00:34:14,221 --> 00:34:16,849
So that it slides perfect.

534
00:34:19,226 --> 00:34:20,435
Nice.

535
00:34:22,771 --> 00:34:24,940
Everything clean.

536
00:34:25,774 --> 00:34:27,359
Oiled.

537
00:34:29,736 --> 00:34:32,614
So that your action is beautiful.

538
00:34:36,577 --> 00:34:38,829
Smooth Charlene.

539
00:35:01,059 --> 00:35:03,562
Leonard talks to his rifle.

540
00:35:05,814 --> 00:35:07,441
Yeah.

541
00:35:14,823 --> 00:35:17,868
I don't think Leonard
can hack it anymore.

542
00:35:19,161 --> 00:35:21,830
I think Leonard's a Section Eight.

543
00:35:25,417 --> 00:35:27,336
It don't surprise me.

544
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:41,266
I wanna slip my tube steak
into your sister.

545
00:35:44,311 --> 00:35:46,522
What will you take in trade?

546
00:35:48,732 --> 00:35:50,651
What do you got?

547
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:06,917
Outstanding, Private Pyle.

548
00:36:07,084 --> 00:36:09,795
I think we finally found
something that you do well.

549
00:36:09,962 --> 00:36:11,797
Sir, yes, sir.

550
00:36:15,175 --> 00:36:16,969
What's your sixth general order?

551
00:36:17,135 --> 00:36:19,638
Sir, the sixth general order
is to receive and obey...

552
00:36:19,805 --> 00:36:22,224
...and pass on to the sentry
who relieves me...

553
00:36:22,391 --> 00:36:24,142
...all orders...

554
00:36:24,351 --> 00:36:26,103
Sir, the private's sixth general...

555
00:36:26,311 --> 00:36:28,689
The private has been instructed
but does not know.

556
00:36:28,856 --> 00:36:32,150
You slimy scumbag,
get on your face and give me 25.

557
00:36:32,317 --> 00:36:34,403
Sir, aye, aye, sir.

558
00:36:38,657 --> 00:36:40,993
How many counts in that movement
you just executed?

559
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:44,329
- Sir, four counts, sir.
- What's the idea of looking in the chamber?

560
00:36:44,496 --> 00:36:48,750
Sir, to guarantee the private is not giving
the inspecting officer a loaded weapon, sir.

561
00:36:48,917 --> 00:36:50,419
What's your fifth general order?

562
00:36:50,586 --> 00:36:54,631
Sir, the fifth general order is to quit my post
only when properly relieved, sir.

563
00:36:54,798 --> 00:36:56,592
What's this weapon's name,
Private Pyle?

564
00:36:56,758 --> 00:36:59,595
Sir, the private's weapon's name
is Charlene, sir.

565
00:36:59,761 --> 00:37:02,514
Private Pyle, you are definitely
born-again hard.

566
00:37:02,723 --> 00:37:06,310
Hell, I may even allow you to serve
as a rifleman in my beloved Corps.

567
00:37:06,476 --> 00:37:08,562
Sir, yes, sir.

568
00:37:11,023 --> 00:37:13,692
I don 't want no teenage queen

569
00:37:13,859 --> 00:37:16,445
I don 't want no teenage queen

570
00:37:16,612 --> 00:37:19,281
I just want my M14

571
00:37:19,448 --> 00:37:22,034
I just want my M14

572
00:37:22,242 --> 00:37:24,912
If I die in a combat zone

573
00:37:25,078 --> 00:37:27,664
If I die in a combat zone

574
00:37:27,831 --> 00:37:30,375
Box me up and ship me home

575
00:37:30,584 --> 00:37:33,212
Box me up and ship me home

576
00:37:33,378 --> 00:37:36,006
Pin my medals upon my chest

577
00:37:36,173 --> 00:37:38,759
Pin my medals upon my chest

578
00:37:38,926 --> 00:37:43,847
Tell my mom I done my best

579
00:37:45,349 --> 00:37:48,977
Graduation is only a few days away...

580
00:37:49,144 --> 00:37:53,690
...and the recruits of Platoon 3092
are salty.

581
00:37:53,857 --> 00:37:57,820
They are ready to eat their own guts
and ask for seconds.

582
00:37:58,403 --> 00:38:03,826
The drill instructors are proud to see
that we are growing beyond their control.

583
00:38:04,243 --> 00:38:07,621
The Marine Corps does not want robots.

584
00:38:07,788 --> 00:38:10,749
The Marine Corps wants killers.

585
00:38:10,916 --> 00:38:14,711
The Marine Corps wants to build
indestructible men.

586
00:38:14,878 --> 00:38:17,673
Men without fear.

587
00:38:19,758 --> 00:38:24,221
T oday, you people are
no longer maggots.

588
00:38:25,764 --> 00:38:29,351
T oday, you are Marines.

589
00:38:29,935 --> 00:38:32,729
You 're part of a brotherhood.

590
00:38:32,938 --> 00:38:37,025
From now on, until the day you die...

591
00:38:37,192 --> 00:38:39,486
...wherever you are...

592
00:38:39,653 --> 00:38:43,157
...every Marine is your brother.

593
00:38:44,283 --> 00:38:47,369
Most of you will go to Vietnam.

594
00:38:47,536 --> 00:38:50,747
Some of you will not come back.

595
00:38:50,956 --> 00:38:53,125
But always remember this:

596
00:38:53,292 --> 00:38:55,169
Marines die.

597
00:38:55,335 --> 00:38:57,880
That's what we're here for.

598
00:38:58,046 --> 00:39:01,133
But the Marine Corps lives forever...

599
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:06,054
...and that means you live forever.

600
00:39:09,933 --> 00:39:11,602
- Peckett.
- Sir, yes, sir.

601
00:39:11,768 --> 00:39:13,437
0300, lnfantry.

602
00:39:13,604 --> 00:39:15,189
- T oe Jam.
- Sir, yes, sir.

603
00:39:15,355 --> 00:39:17,232
0300, lnfantry.

604
00:39:17,399 --> 00:39:19,109
- Adams.
- Sir, yes, sir.

605
00:39:19,276 --> 00:39:20,986
1800, Engineers.

606
00:39:21,153 --> 00:39:22,654
You go out and find mines.

607
00:39:22,821 --> 00:39:24,656
- Cowboy.
- Sir, yes, sir.

608
00:39:24,823 --> 00:39:26,658
0300, lnfantry.

609
00:39:26,825 --> 00:39:28,243
- Taylor.
- Sir, yes, sir.

610
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:30,204
0300, lnfantry.

611
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:31,955
- Joker.
- Sir, yes, sir.

612
00:39:32,164 --> 00:39:35,292
4212, Basic Military Journalism.

613
00:39:35,459 --> 00:39:37,503
You gotta be shitting me, Joker.

614
00:39:37,711 --> 00:39:39,213
You think you're Mickey Spillane?

615
00:39:39,379 --> 00:39:41,423
You think you're some kind
of fucking writer?

616
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:44,009
Sir, I wrote for
my high school newspaper, sir.

617
00:39:44,218 --> 00:39:47,846
Jesus H. Christ.
You're not a writer, you're a killer.

618
00:39:48,055 --> 00:39:49,264
A killer, yes, sir.

619
00:39:49,431 --> 00:39:50,974
Gomer Pyle.

620
00:39:51,183 --> 00:39:53,769
- Gomer Pyle.
- Sir, yes, sir.

621
00:39:53,936 --> 00:39:57,856
You forget your fucking name?
0300, lnfantry. You made it.

622
00:39:58,065 --> 00:40:00,192
- Perkins.
- Sir, yes, sir.

623
00:40:04,363 --> 00:40:07,199
Our last night on the island.

624
00:40:07,366 --> 00:40:09,868
I draw fire watch.

625
00:41:12,681 --> 00:41:15,809
Hi, Joker.

626
00:41:37,831 --> 00:41:41,335
Are those live rounds?

627
00:41:47,382 --> 00:41:51,178
Seven-six-two millimeter.

628
00:41:52,846 --> 00:41:56,225
Full metal jacket.

629
00:42:04,817 --> 00:42:06,735
Leonard...

630
00:42:06,902 --> 00:42:10,781
...if Hartman comes in here
and catches us...

631
00:42:11,949 --> 00:42:15,035
...we'll both be in a world of shit.

632
00:42:18,288 --> 00:42:20,582
I am...

633
00:42:21,917 --> 00:42:24,336
...in a world...

634
00:42:25,879 --> 00:42:28,382
...of shit.

635
00:42:31,635 --> 00:42:32,886
Left shoulder.

636
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:36,849
Right shoulder.

637
00:42:39,935 --> 00:42:41,228
Lock and load.

638
00:42:46,024 --> 00:42:47,401
Order.

639
00:42:50,237 --> 00:42:52,030
This is my rifle.

640
00:42:52,197 --> 00:42:54,950
There are many like it,
but this one is mine.

641
00:42:56,243 --> 00:42:59,538
My rifle is my best friend.
It is my life.

642
00:42:59,705 --> 00:43:02,207
Get back in your bunks.

643
00:43:02,374 --> 00:43:04,543
What is this Mickey Mouse shit?

644
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:09,590
What in the name of Jesus H. Christ
are you animals doing in my head?

645
00:43:09,756 --> 00:43:13,093
Why is Private Pyle out of his bunk
after lights out?

646
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:16,096
Why is Private Pyle
holding that weapon?

647
00:43:16,263 --> 00:43:19,600
Why aren't you stomping
Private Pyle's guts out?

648
00:43:19,808 --> 00:43:22,978
Sir, it is the private's duty
to inform the senior drill instructor...

649
00:43:23,187 --> 00:43:27,900
...that Private Pyle has a full magazine
and has locked and loaded, sir.

650
00:43:35,491 --> 00:43:39,203
Now you listen to me, Private Pyle...

651
00:43:39,369 --> 00:43:42,164
...and you listen good.

652
00:43:42,581 --> 00:43:44,833
I want that weapon...

653
00:43:45,042 --> 00:43:47,669
...and I want it now.

654
00:43:48,170 --> 00:43:52,424
You will place that rifle
on the deck at your feet...

655
00:43:52,591 --> 00:43:55,427
...and step back away from it.

656
00:44:02,893 --> 00:44:06,355
What is your major malfunction,
numb-nuts?

657
00:44:06,563 --> 00:44:10,818
Didn't Mommy and Daddy show you
enough attention when you were a child?

658
00:44:36,385 --> 00:44:38,428
Easy, Leonard.

659
00:44:41,932 --> 00:44:43,976
Go easy, man.

660
00:45:09,668 --> 00:45:10,919
No!

661
00:46:11,396 --> 00:46:13,065
Hey, baby.

662
00:46:13,232 --> 00:46:16,276
You got girlfriend Vietnam?

663
00:46:16,443 --> 00:46:19,071
Not just this minute.

664
00:46:19,279 --> 00:46:22,574
Well, baby, me so horny.

665
00:46:22,741 --> 00:46:24,910
Me so horny.

666
00:46:25,077 --> 00:46:27,621
Me love you long time.

667
00:46:28,163 --> 00:46:29,414
You party?

668
00:46:29,581 --> 00:46:31,708
Yeah, we might party.

669
00:46:31,875 --> 00:46:34,670
- How much?
- Fifteen dollar.

670
00:46:34,837 --> 00:46:38,882
- Fifteen dollars for both of us.
- No. Each you $15.

671
00:46:39,049 --> 00:46:40,968
Me love you long time.

672
00:46:41,134 --> 00:46:43,762
Me so horny.

673
00:46:43,971 --> 00:46:46,265
Fifteen dollar too beaucoup.

674
00:46:46,431 --> 00:46:49,685
- Five dollars each.
- Me sucky-sucky.

675
00:46:49,852 --> 00:46:52,437
Me love you too much.

676
00:46:53,856 --> 00:46:57,151
Five dollars is all my mom
allows me to spend.

677
00:46:57,317 --> 00:47:00,237
Okay. Ten dollar each.

678
00:47:00,445 --> 00:47:02,948
What do we get for $10?

679
00:47:03,115 --> 00:47:05,909
Everything you want.

680
00:47:06,076 --> 00:47:09,246
- Everything?
- Everything.

681
00:47:10,289 --> 00:47:14,376
Well, old buddy, feel like spending
some of your hard-earned money?

682
00:47:14,543 --> 00:47:16,420
Just a minute.

683
00:47:16,795 --> 00:47:20,924
You know, half these gook whores
are serving officers in the Vietcong.

684
00:47:21,091 --> 00:47:22,843
The other half have got TB.

685
00:47:23,677 --> 00:47:26,555
Be sure you only fuck
the ones that cough.

686
00:48:14,937 --> 00:48:18,232
That little sucker really had
some moves on him, didn't he?

687
00:48:18,398 --> 00:48:20,067
Yeah.

688
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:24,446
You know what really pisses me off
about these people?

689
00:48:24,613 --> 00:48:25,948
What?

690
00:48:26,156 --> 00:48:29,993
We're supposed to be helping them, and
they shit all over us every chance they get.

691
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:32,120
I just can't feature that.

692
00:48:32,287 --> 00:48:35,749
Don't take it too hard, Rafterman.
It's just business.

693
00:48:37,584 --> 00:48:40,921
I hate Da Nang, Joker.
I wanna go out into the field.

694
00:48:41,129 --> 00:48:43,048
I've been in country
almost three months...

695
00:48:43,257 --> 00:48:46,009
...and all I do is take handshake shots
at award ceremonies.

696
00:48:46,176 --> 00:48:49,221
You'd get wasted your first day in the field
and it'd be my fault.

697
00:48:49,388 --> 00:48:51,682
A high school girl could do my job.

698
00:48:51,849 --> 00:48:53,642
I wanna get out into the shit.

699
00:48:53,809 --> 00:48:56,436
I wanna get some trigger time.

700
00:48:57,312 --> 00:49:00,816
If you get killed, your mom will find me
after I rotate back to the world...

701
00:49:00,983 --> 00:49:02,776
...and she'll beat the shit out of me.

702
00:49:02,943 --> 00:49:05,445
That's a negative, Rafterman.

703
00:49:08,157 --> 00:49:12,119
Okay, guys. Let's keep it short and sweet
today. Anybody got anything new?

704
00:49:14,496 --> 00:49:18,125
There's a rumor going around that
the Tet ceasefire is gonna be canceled.

705
00:49:18,584 --> 00:49:20,085
Rear-echelon paranoia.

706
00:49:20,419 --> 00:49:24,548
A bro in intelligence says Charlie might try
to pull off something big during Tet.

707
00:49:24,715 --> 00:49:27,217
They say the same thing every year.

708
00:49:27,342 --> 00:49:29,178
There's a lot of talk about it, sir.

709
00:49:29,344 --> 00:49:31,138
I wouldn't lose any sleep over it.

710
00:49:31,305 --> 00:49:35,475
The Tet holiday is like the Fourth of July,
Christmas and New Year all rolled into one.

711
00:49:35,642 --> 00:49:38,979
Every zipperhead in Nam,
North and South, will be banging gongs...

712
00:49:39,188 --> 00:49:42,024
...barking at the moon
and visiting his dead relatives.

713
00:49:42,441 --> 00:49:45,819
Right. Ann-Margret
and entourage are due here next week.

714
00:49:45,986 --> 00:49:49,239
I want someone on the airfield
and stick with her for a couple of days.

715
00:49:49,406 --> 00:49:51,909
- Rafterman, you take it.
- Aye, aye, sir.

716
00:49:52,075 --> 00:49:53,744
And get some good low-angle stuff.

717
00:49:53,911 --> 00:49:57,998
Don't make it too obvious,
but I wanna see fur and early-morning dew.

718
00:49:58,165 --> 00:50:00,417
- Yes, sir.
- "Diplomats in dungarees.

719
00:50:00,584 --> 00:50:04,296
Marine engineers lend a helping hand
rebuilding Dong Phuc village recently..."

720
00:50:04,463 --> 00:50:07,758
Chili, if we move Vietnamese,
they are evacuees...

721
00:50:07,925 --> 00:50:11,053
...if they come to us to be evacuated,
they are refugees.

722
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:12,971
I'll make a note of it, sir.

723
00:50:13,639 --> 00:50:16,183
"NVA soldier deserts
after reading pamphlets.

724
00:50:16,350 --> 00:50:20,395
A young North Vietnamese Army regular,
who realized his side could not win...

725
00:50:20,562 --> 00:50:23,357
...deserted from his unit after reading
Open Arms pamphlets."

726
00:50:23,524 --> 00:50:26,610
That's good, Dave. But why say
North Vietnamese Army regular?

727
00:50:26,777 --> 00:50:30,531
Is there an irregular?
How about North Vietnamese Army soldier?

728
00:50:30,697 --> 00:50:31,740
I'll fix it up, sir.

729
00:50:32,199 --> 00:50:34,243
Lawrence Welk Show
is out on TV in two weeks.

730
00:50:34,409 --> 00:50:35,577
Dave, do 100 words on it.

731
00:50:35,744 --> 00:50:38,247
- AFTV will give you some background stuff.
- Sir.

732
00:50:38,455 --> 00:50:40,207
" Not while we're eating.

733
00:50:40,374 --> 00:50:42,918
NVA learned Marines
on a search-and-destroy mission...

734
00:50:43,085 --> 00:50:45,420
...don't like to be interrupted
while eating chow."

735
00:50:45,587 --> 00:50:49,466
Search-and-destroy. We have a new
directive from MAF on this.

736
00:50:49,758 --> 00:50:54,263
In future, in place of search-and-destroy,
substitute the phrase sweep-and-clear.

737
00:50:54,429 --> 00:50:57,724
- Sweep-and-clear, got it?
- Got it. Very catchy.

738
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:00,811
And, Joker, where's the weenie?

739
00:51:01,395 --> 00:51:02,938
Sir?

740
00:51:03,147 --> 00:51:07,067
The kill, Joker. The kill. I mean, all that fire,
the grunts must have hit something.

741
00:51:07,234 --> 00:51:08,485
Didn't see them.

742
00:51:09,528 --> 00:51:12,948
Joker, I've told you,
we run two basic stories here.

743
00:51:13,115 --> 00:51:16,577
Grunts who give half their pay to buy
gooks toothbrushes and deodorants.

744
00:51:16,743 --> 00:51:18,996
Winning of hearts and minds. Okay?

745
00:51:19,163 --> 00:51:22,791
And combat action that results in a kill.
Winning the war.

746
00:51:22,958 --> 00:51:26,670
Now, you must have seen blood trails.
Drag marks?

747
00:51:26,837 --> 00:51:28,505
It was raining, sir.

748
00:51:29,006 --> 00:51:31,842
Well, that's why God passed
the law of probability.

749
00:51:32,009 --> 00:51:35,095
Now rewrite it and give it
a happy ending. Say, one killed.

750
00:51:35,262 --> 00:51:37,639
Make it a sapper or an officer. Which?

751
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:39,474
Whichever you say.

752
00:51:39,641 --> 00:51:42,144
Grunts like reading about dead officers.

753
00:51:42,269 --> 00:51:45,522
Okay, an officer. How about a general?

754
00:51:45,981 --> 00:51:47,274
Joker...

755
00:51:47,441 --> 00:51:50,819
...maybe you'd like our guys
to read the paper and feel bad.

756
00:51:51,028 --> 00:51:54,156
I mean, in case you didn't know it,
this is not a very popular war.

757
00:51:54,323 --> 00:51:56,450
Now, it is our job to report the news...

758
00:51:56,617 --> 00:51:59,703
...that these why-are-we-here
civilian newsmen ignore.

759
00:52:00,454 --> 00:52:04,041
Sir, maybe you should go out
on some ops yourself.

760
00:52:04,249 --> 00:52:07,961
I'm sure you could find a lot more
blood trails and drag marks.

761
00:52:08,587 --> 00:52:10,547
Joker, I've had my ass in the grass.

762
00:52:10,756 --> 00:52:12,716
Can't say I liked it much.

763
00:52:12,883 --> 00:52:15,886
Lots of bugs and too dangerous.

764
00:52:16,053 --> 00:52:19,056
As it happens, my present duties
keep me where I belong...

765
00:52:19,264 --> 00:52:21,433
...in the rear with the gear.

766
00:52:29,149 --> 00:52:31,944
Tet. The year of the monkey.

767
00:52:32,110 --> 00:52:35,239
Vietnamese Lunar New Year's Eve.

768
00:52:35,447 --> 00:52:40,536
Down in Dogpatch, the gooks are
shooting off fireworks to celebrate.

769
00:52:49,253 --> 00:52:52,923
I am fucking bored to death, man.

770
00:52:53,507 --> 00:52:56,009
I gotta get back in the shit.

771
00:52:56,134 --> 00:52:59,263
I ain't heard a shot fired
in anger in weeks.

772
00:53:00,055 --> 00:53:01,431
Joker's so tough...

773
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:05,060
...he'd eat the boogers
out of a dead man's nose...

774
00:53:05,227 --> 00:53:07,104
...then ask for seconds.

775
00:53:07,646 --> 00:53:09,690
Listen up, pilgrim.

776
00:53:09,857 --> 00:53:14,361
A day without blood is
like a day without sunshine.

777
00:53:14,862 --> 00:53:16,155
Shit.

778
00:53:16,321 --> 00:53:20,200
Joker thinks the bad bush is between
an old mama-san's legs.

779
00:53:20,367 --> 00:53:22,286
He's never been in the shit.

780
00:53:22,494 --> 00:53:25,205
It's hard to talk about it, man.
It's like on Hastings.

781
00:53:25,372 --> 00:53:27,916
You weren't on
Operation Hastings, Payback.

782
00:53:28,083 --> 00:53:30,752
- You weren't even in country.
- Eat shit and die...

783
00:53:30,919 --> 00:53:33,797
...you fucking Spanish-American.
You fucking pogue.

784
00:53:33,964 --> 00:53:35,382
I was there, man.

785
00:53:35,549 --> 00:53:37,259
I was in the shit with the grunts.

786
00:53:37,426 --> 00:53:41,221
Don't listen to
any of Payback's bullshit, Rafterman.

787
00:53:41,388 --> 00:53:44,808
Sometimes he thinks he's John Wayne.

788
00:53:45,517 --> 00:53:47,019
You listen to Joker, new guy.

789
00:53:47,144 --> 00:53:48,770
He knows ti ti.

790
00:53:48,937 --> 00:53:50,481
Very little.

791
00:53:50,647 --> 00:53:53,442
You know he's never been in the shit.
He ain't got the stare.

792
00:53:53,609 --> 00:53:57,154
- The stare?
- The thousand-yard stare.

793
00:53:57,321 --> 00:54:00,324
A Marine gets it after he's been
in the shit for too long.

794
00:54:00,491 --> 00:54:02,034
It's like-

795
00:54:02,409 --> 00:54:04,328
It's like you're really seeing beyond.

796
00:54:05,078 --> 00:54:06,288
I got it.

797
00:54:06,455 --> 00:54:08,290
All field Marines got it.

798
00:54:08,457 --> 00:54:09,958
And you'll have it too.

799
00:54:10,125 --> 00:54:11,418
I will?

800
00:54:11,585 --> 00:54:13,170
Hey, Payback...

801
00:54:13,337 --> 00:54:16,423
...how do you stop five black dudes
from raping a white chick?

802
00:54:17,049 --> 00:54:19,927
- Fuck you, Stork.
- Throw them a basketball.

803
00:54:24,932 --> 00:54:27,059
- lncoming.
- Oh, shit.

804
00:54:28,727 --> 00:54:30,604
Them are outgoing.

805
00:54:32,564 --> 00:54:34,775
- That ain't outgoing.
- That ain't outgoing.

806
00:54:34,942 --> 00:54:36,568
Now, what did I just say?

807
00:55:14,690 --> 00:55:17,943
Hey, I hope they're just fucking with us.

808
00:55:18,110 --> 00:55:21,363
- I ain't ready for this shit.
- Amen.

809
00:56:14,291 --> 00:56:16,210
Cease fire.

810
00:56:20,255 --> 00:56:22,382
- Cease fire.
- Cease fire.

811
00:56:26,053 --> 00:56:28,055
Cease fire.

812
00:56:39,024 --> 00:56:41,026
The enemy...

813
00:56:41,193 --> 00:56:43,695
...has very deceitfully...

814
00:56:43,862 --> 00:56:46,740
...taken advantage
of the Tet ceasefire...

815
00:56:46,907 --> 00:56:50,244
...to launch an offensive
all over the country.

816
00:56:50,577 --> 00:56:54,248
So far, we 've had it pretty easy here.

817
00:56:54,414 --> 00:56:56,625
But we seem to be the exception.

818
00:56:57,334 --> 00:57:02,089
Charlie has hit every major military target
in Vietnam and hit them hard.

819
00:57:02,297 --> 00:57:08,136
In Saigon the United States Embassy
has been overrun by suicide squads.

820
00:57:08,345 --> 00:57:10,264
- Shit.
- Jesus Christ, man.

821
00:57:10,430 --> 00:57:13,976
Khe Sanh is standing by to be overrun.

822
00:57:15,227 --> 00:57:17,813
We also have reports
that a division of NVA...

823
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:22,901
...has occupied all of the city of Hue
south of the Perfume River.

824
00:57:23,068 --> 00:57:26,155
In strategic terms,
Charlie's cut the country in half...

825
00:57:26,321 --> 00:57:29,074
...the civilian press
are about to wet their pants...

826
00:57:29,241 --> 00:57:34,163
...and we've heard even Cronkite's
gonna say the war is now unwinnable.

827
00:57:34,788 --> 00:57:36,498
In other words...

828
00:57:36,707 --> 00:57:41,503
...it's a huge shit sandwich
and we're all gonna have to take a bite.

829
00:57:44,381 --> 00:57:46,175
Sir.

830
00:57:46,466 --> 00:57:49,344
Does this mean that Ann-Margret's
not coming?

831
00:57:54,141 --> 00:57:58,520
Joker, I want you
to get straight up to Phu Bai.

832
00:57:58,979 --> 00:58:02,191
Captain January will need all his people.

833
00:58:02,357 --> 00:58:04,610
- Yes, sir.
- And, Joker...

834
00:58:04,776 --> 00:58:07,779
...you will take off that damn button.

835
00:58:07,946 --> 00:58:11,366
How's it gonna look if you get killed
wearing a peace symbol?

836
00:58:11,575 --> 00:58:13,035
Sir.

837
00:58:13,202 --> 00:58:15,412
Permission to go with Joker?

838
00:58:16,121 --> 00:58:18,040
- Permission granted.
- Thank you, sir.

839
00:58:18,248 --> 00:58:21,168
Sir, permission not to take
Rafterman with me?

840
00:58:21,335 --> 00:58:23,420
You still here?

841
00:58:23,629 --> 00:58:27,257
Vanish, Joker, most ricky-tick,
and take Rafterman with you.

842
00:58:27,424 --> 00:58:29,760
You're responsible for him.

843
00:59:05,587 --> 00:59:07,214
Get some.

844
00:59:08,048 --> 00:59:09,800
Get some.

845
00:59:12,386 --> 00:59:15,305
Get some. Get some. Yeah. Yeah.

846
00:59:16,306 --> 00:59:20,018
Get some. Get some.
Come on. Come on.

847
00:59:24,064 --> 00:59:25,649
Get some.

848
00:59:33,198 --> 00:59:35,325
Get some, baby.

849
00:59:35,701 --> 00:59:38,078
Get some. Get some. Get some.

850
00:59:39,079 --> 00:59:41,707
Get some. Get some, come on.
Get it, come on.

851
00:59:41,874 --> 00:59:44,376
Get some. Get some. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

852
00:59:44,543 --> 00:59:46,753
I've got you, mother.

853
00:59:51,592 --> 00:59:54,720
Anyone who runs is a VC.

854
00:59:55,304 --> 00:59:57,848
Anyone who stands still...

855
00:59:58,015 --> 01:00:00,934
...is a well-disciplined VC.

856
01:00:02,895 --> 01:00:06,523
You guys ought to do a story
about me sometime.

857
01:00:07,691 --> 01:00:10,736
Why should we do a story about you?

858
01:00:11,111 --> 01:00:13,238
Because I'm so fucking good.

859
01:00:13,405 --> 01:00:15,532
That ain't no shit neither.

860
01:00:15,699 --> 01:00:20,162
I've done got me 157 dead gooks killed.

861
01:00:20,329 --> 01:00:23,081
And 50 water buffaloes too.

862
01:00:23,290 --> 01:00:26,084
Them are all certified.

863
01:00:26,251 --> 01:00:29,087
Any women or children?

864
01:00:29,630 --> 01:00:31,256
Sometimes.

865
01:00:32,382 --> 01:00:36,094
How can you shoot women and children?

866
01:00:36,678 --> 01:00:37,971
Easy.

867
01:00:38,138 --> 01:00:40,557
You just don't lead them so much.

868
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:44,061
Ain't war hell?

869
01:01:20,639 --> 01:01:22,766
Top, we wanna get in the shit.

870
01:01:22,933 --> 01:01:24,434
Down the road. Two-Five.

871
01:01:24,601 --> 01:01:27,354
Two-Five. Outstanding. Thanks, Top.

872
01:01:52,129 --> 01:01:53,755
Excuse me.

873
01:01:53,922 --> 01:01:55,299
Sir.

874
01:01:55,465 --> 01:01:58,552
We're looking for 1 st Platoon,
Hotel Two-Five.

875
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:00,179
I got a bro named Cowboy there.

876
01:02:00,345 --> 01:02:01,722
You people one-one?

877
01:02:01,930 --> 01:02:04,224
No, sir.
We're reporters from Stars and Stripes.

878
01:02:04,391 --> 01:02:06,226
- Stars and Stripes?
- Yes, sir.

879
01:02:06,393 --> 01:02:08,395
I'm Cowboy's platoon commander.

880
01:02:08,604 --> 01:02:11,398
Cowboy's just down the road
in the platoon area.

881
01:02:11,565 --> 01:02:15,235
- You mind if we tag along, sir?
- No problem. Welcome aboard.

882
01:02:15,402 --> 01:02:18,614
By the way, my name's Schinoski.
Walter J. Schinoski.

883
01:02:18,780 --> 01:02:21,033
My people call me Mr. Touchdown.

884
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:22,701
I played ball for Notre Dame.

885
01:02:22,868 --> 01:02:24,161
- Notre Dame?
- Yeah.

886
01:02:24,328 --> 01:02:27,039
- All right.
- You here to make Cowboy famous?

887
01:02:27,206 --> 01:02:28,790
Never happen, sir.

888
01:02:28,957 --> 01:02:33,253
Well, if you people came looking for a story,
this is your lucky day.

889
01:02:33,420 --> 01:02:36,590
We got Condition Red
and we're definitely expecting rain.

890
01:02:36,757 --> 01:02:39,510
Outstanding, sir.
We taking care of business?

891
01:02:39,676 --> 01:02:41,178
Well, the NVA are dug in deep.

892
01:02:41,345 --> 01:02:43,889
Hotel Company's still working
this side of the river...

893
01:02:44,056 --> 01:02:46,266
...street by street and house by house.

894
01:02:46,433 --> 01:02:48,435
Charles definitely
got his shit together...

895
01:02:48,602 --> 01:02:50,854
...but we're still getting
some decent kills here.

896
01:02:51,021 --> 01:02:55,234
We heard some scuttlebutt, sir, about
the NVA executing a lot of gook civilians.

897
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:56,819
That's affirmative.

898
01:02:56,985 --> 01:03:00,614
I saw some bodies about a half a klick
this side of Phu Cam Canal.

899
01:03:00,823 --> 01:03:02,991
Will you show me where, sir?

900
01:03:05,327 --> 01:03:06,912
Here's the canal.

901
01:03:29,893 --> 01:03:33,063
The dead have been covered with lime.

902
01:03:34,273 --> 01:03:37,151
The dead know only one thing:

903
01:03:37,818 --> 01:03:40,320
It is better to be alive.

904
01:03:46,660 --> 01:03:48,245
Excuse me?

905
01:03:48,412 --> 01:03:50,706
- Good morning, lieutenant.
- Morning.

906
01:03:50,873 --> 01:03:54,418
I make it 20.
Is that the official body count, sir?

907
01:03:54,585 --> 01:03:56,044
What outfit are you men with?

908
01:03:56,211 --> 01:03:58,338
Sir, we're reporters
from Stars and Stripes.

909
01:03:58,589 --> 01:04:00,132
- Oh, I see.
- I'm Sergeant Joker...

910
01:04:00,299 --> 01:04:02,593
...and this photographer is Rafterman.

911
01:04:02,759 --> 01:04:05,387
I'm Lieutenant Cleves
and I'm from Hartford, Connecticut.

912
01:04:05,554 --> 01:04:08,474
- Have you got a body count, sir?
- We think it's 20.

913
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:10,726
Do you know how it happened, sir?

914
01:04:11,101 --> 01:04:14,897
Well, it seems the NVA came in
with a list of gook names.

915
01:04:15,063 --> 01:04:19,610
Government officials, policemen,
ARVlN officers, school teachers.

916
01:04:19,776 --> 01:04:21,778
They went around
to their houses real polite...

917
01:04:21,945 --> 01:04:25,282
...and asked them to report
the next day for political reeducation.

918
01:04:25,782 --> 01:04:28,076
Everybody who turned up got shot.

919
01:04:28,243 --> 01:04:29,870
Some they buried alive.

920
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:31,413
Ready.

921
01:04:32,998 --> 01:04:34,458
Colonel.

922
01:04:35,959 --> 01:04:38,670
Marine, what is that button
on your body armor?

923
01:04:38,837 --> 01:04:40,130
A peace symbol, sir.

924
01:04:40,297 --> 01:04:42,883
- Where did you get it?
- I don't remember, sir.

925
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:45,177
What is that written on your helmet?

926
01:04:45,344 --> 01:04:46,845
Born to kill, sir.

927
01:04:47,054 --> 01:04:50,015
You write born to kill on your helmet
and wear a peace button.

928
01:04:50,182 --> 01:04:52,518
What's that supposed to be,
some kind of sick joke?

929
01:04:52,684 --> 01:04:55,270
- No, sir.
- What is it supposed to mean?

930
01:04:55,437 --> 01:04:56,814
I don't know, sir.

931
01:04:56,980 --> 01:04:58,440
- You don't know much.
- No, sir.

932
01:04:58,607 --> 01:05:01,860
Get your head and your ass wired together
or I will take a shit on you.

933
01:05:02,027 --> 01:05:03,779
- Yes, sir.
- Now answer my question...

934
01:05:03,946 --> 01:05:06,323
...or you'll be standing tall
before the man.

935
01:05:06,490 --> 01:05:09,451
I was trying to suggest something
about the duality of man, sir.

936
01:05:09,618 --> 01:05:13,205
- The what?
- The duality of man. The Jungian thing, sir.

937
01:05:14,414 --> 01:05:16,667
- Whose side are you on, son?
- Our side, sir.

938
01:05:16,834 --> 01:05:18,460
- You love your country?
- Yes, sir.

939
01:05:18,627 --> 01:05:20,212
How about getting with the program.

940
01:05:20,379 --> 01:05:22,798
Jump on the team and come on in
for the big win.

941
01:05:23,006 --> 01:05:24,007
Yes, sir.

942
01:05:24,216 --> 01:05:28,637
All I've asked of my Marines is for them to
obey my orders as they would God's word.

943
01:05:28,846 --> 01:05:30,556
We are here to help the Vietnamese...

944
01:05:30,722 --> 01:05:34,643
...because inside every gook
there is an American trying to get out.

945
01:05:34,852 --> 01:05:36,520
It's a hardball world, son.

946
01:05:36,687 --> 01:05:40,315
We've gotta try to keep our heads
until this peace craze blows over.

947
01:05:40,482 --> 01:05:41,525
Aye, aye, sir.

948
01:05:51,952 --> 01:05:55,706
Hey, bro. We're looking for 1 st Platoon,
Hotel Two-Five.

949
01:05:55,873 --> 01:05:57,666
Around the back.

950
01:06:06,258 --> 01:06:09,386
- First Platoon?
- Yeah, through there.

951
01:06:33,076 --> 01:06:35,120
Hey, Lone Ranger.

952
01:06:39,166 --> 01:06:42,836
- Holy shit. It's the Joker.
- You old motherfucker.

953
01:06:47,925 --> 01:06:48,926
What's happening?

954
01:06:49,092 --> 01:06:52,930
Thought I hoped I'd never see you again,
you piece of shit.

955
01:06:53,430 --> 01:06:54,932
What's happening, man?

956
01:06:55,140 --> 01:06:58,519
Oh, just waiting to get back
to the land of the big Px.

957
01:06:58,685 --> 01:07:00,646
Yeah? Well, why go back?

958
01:07:00,854 --> 01:07:02,356
Here or there, samey-same.

959
01:07:02,523 --> 01:07:04,233
- Been getting any?
- Only your sister.

960
01:07:04,399 --> 01:07:08,487
Well, better my sister than my mom,
though my mom's not bad.

961
01:07:09,112 --> 01:07:11,698
Hey, you Hogs, listen up.

962
01:07:11,865 --> 01:07:15,035
This is my bro, Joker, from the lsland,
and this is...?

963
01:07:15,202 --> 01:07:17,162
- Rafterman.
- Rafterman.

964
01:07:17,371 --> 01:07:20,207
They're from Stars and Stripes.
They'll make you famous.

965
01:07:20,374 --> 01:07:21,667
- Fucking A.
- Yeah.

966
01:07:21,834 --> 01:07:23,752
We're the Lusthog Squad.

967
01:07:23,919 --> 01:07:26,505
We're life-takers and heartbreakers.

968
01:07:26,672 --> 01:07:30,175
We shoot them full of holes
and fill them full of lead.

969
01:07:34,596 --> 01:07:37,307
You a photographer?

970
01:07:38,725 --> 01:07:41,311
No, I'm a combat correspondent.

971
01:07:42,312 --> 01:07:44,815
Oh, you seen much combat?

972
01:07:47,568 --> 01:07:49,903
Well, I've seen a little on TV.

973
01:07:54,241 --> 01:07:57,035
You're a real comedian.

974
01:07:58,287 --> 01:08:01,039
Well, they call me the Joker.

975
01:08:02,291 --> 01:08:04,793
Well, I got a joke for you.

976
01:08:04,918 --> 01:08:08,213
I'm gonna tear you a new asshole.

977
01:08:11,425 --> 01:08:13,260
Well, pilgrim...

978
01:08:13,427 --> 01:08:18,599
...only after you eat the peanuts
out of my shit.

979
01:08:23,979 --> 01:08:26,106
You talk the talk.

980
01:08:27,316 --> 01:08:30,110
Do you walk the walk?

981
01:08:34,531 --> 01:08:36,033
Now, you might not believe it...

982
01:08:36,450 --> 01:08:41,455
...but under fire, Animal Mother's one of
the finest human beings in the world.

983
01:08:41,663 --> 01:08:45,792
All he needs is somebody to throw
hand grenades at him the rest of his life.

984
01:08:45,959 --> 01:08:50,130
That's a roger, come on.
Sit down. Come on, new guy.

985
01:08:52,841 --> 01:08:55,135
Hey, jungle-bunny.

986
01:08:55,302 --> 01:08:58,096
Thank God for the sickle cell, huh?

987
01:08:58,263 --> 01:09:00,098
Yeah, Mother.

988
01:09:01,350 --> 01:09:03,143
Hey, photographer.

989
01:09:04,561 --> 01:09:06,605
You wanna take a good picture?

990
01:09:07,856 --> 01:09:09,316
Here, man.

991
01:09:09,650 --> 01:09:11,151
Take this.

992
01:09:19,993 --> 01:09:22,830
This is my bro.

993
01:09:32,422 --> 01:09:34,508
This is his party.

994
01:09:34,716 --> 01:09:36,844
He's the guest of honor.

995
01:09:37,803 --> 01:09:40,472
Today is his birthday.

996
01:09:41,056 --> 01:09:43,892
Happy birthday, zipperhead.

997
01:09:44,893 --> 01:09:47,271
I will never forget this day.

998
01:09:47,437 --> 01:09:52,734
The day I came to Hue City
and fought 1 million NVA gooks.

999
01:09:53,235 --> 01:09:56,530
I love the little commie bastards, man,
I really do.

1000
01:09:56,989 --> 01:10:00,242
These enemy grunts are as hard
as slant-eyed drill instructors.

1001
01:10:02,202 --> 01:10:05,164
These are great days we're living, bros.

1002
01:10:06,290 --> 01:10:10,335
We are jolly green giants,
walking the earth with guns.

1003
01:10:11,086 --> 01:10:13,463
These people we wasted here today...

1004
01:10:13,630 --> 01:10:16,884
...are the finest human beings
we will ever know.

1005
01:10:18,677 --> 01:10:20,345
After we rotate back to the world...

1006
01:10:20,512 --> 01:10:23,807
...we're gonna miss not having
anyone around who's worth shooting.

1007
01:11:30,290 --> 01:11:32,960
- Stay put, keep your heads down.
- Stay put.

1008
01:11:33,126 --> 01:11:34,753
Stay put.

1009
01:11:49,935 --> 01:11:51,979
Shit.

1010
01:11:59,862 --> 01:12:03,365
Delta Six Actual, this is Murphy. Over.

1011
01:12:05,075 --> 01:12:08,745
Delta Six Actual, this is Murphy. Over.

1012
01:12:09,872 --> 01:12:11,248
Delta Six.

1013
01:12:11,415 --> 01:12:14,543
Delta Six, we are receiving incoming fire
from the vill.

1014
01:12:15,002 --> 01:12:16,587
The lieutenant is down.

1015
01:12:16,795 --> 01:12:19,756
We're going to stop here
and check out what's in front of us. Over.

1016
01:12:25,387 --> 01:12:27,890
Okay, Lusthog Squad, listen up.

1017
01:12:28,557 --> 01:12:30,642
Gonna move up these roads
and check the vill.

1018
01:12:30,809 --> 01:12:33,187
I want the third team up this road here.

1019
01:12:33,353 --> 01:12:37,274
First and second fire team behind me
up this other road, okay?

1020
01:12:37,733 --> 01:12:40,569
Let's go. Let's get it done.

1021
01:17:07,628 --> 01:17:10,297
Is that you, John Wayne? Is this me?

1022
01:17:10,464 --> 01:17:13,634
Hey, start the cameras.
This is Vietnam: The Movie.

1023
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:16,178
Yeah, Joker can be John Wayne,
I'll be a horse.

1024
01:17:16,345 --> 01:17:19,014
- T. H. E. Rock can be a rock.
- I'll be Ann-Margret.

1025
01:17:19,181 --> 01:17:21,099
Animal Mother can be a rabid buffalo.

1026
01:17:21,308 --> 01:17:23,769
- I'll be General Custer.
- Who'll be the lndian?

1027
01:17:23,977 --> 01:17:26,980
Hey, we'll let the gooks play the lndians.

1028
01:18:05,185 --> 01:18:07,146
You're going home now.

1029
01:18:11,191 --> 01:18:13,026
Semper fi.

1030
01:18:15,988 --> 01:18:18,574
We're mean Marines, sir.

1031
01:18:21,952 --> 01:18:24,079
Go easy, bros.

1032
01:18:28,250 --> 01:18:30,294
Better you than me.

1033
01:18:34,006 --> 01:18:36,675
Well, at least they died
for a good cause.

1034
01:18:37,468 --> 01:18:39,720
What cause was that?

1035
01:18:41,221 --> 01:18:42,764
Freedom.

1036
01:18:43,599 --> 01:18:46,518
Flush out your headgear, new guy.

1037
01:18:48,228 --> 01:18:51,064
You think we waste gooks for freedom?

1038
01:18:52,232 --> 01:18:54,401
This is a slaughter.

1039
01:18:55,652 --> 01:18:59,198
If I'm gonna get my balls
blown off for a word...

1040
01:19:00,282 --> 01:19:03,160
...my word is poon tang.

1041
01:19:05,913 --> 01:19:08,624
Tough break for Hand Job.

1042
01:19:09,541 --> 01:19:13,003
He was all set
to get shipped out on a medical.

1043
01:19:14,546 --> 01:19:16,507
What was the matter with him?

1044
01:19:18,842 --> 01:19:22,054
He was jerking off 10 times a day.

1045
01:19:23,138 --> 01:19:26,767
It's no shit. At least 10 times a day.

1046
01:19:28,685 --> 01:19:34,024
Last week he was sent down to Da Nang
to see the Navy head shrinker.

1047
01:19:34,441 --> 01:19:38,487
The crazy fucker starts jerking off
in the waiting room.

1048
01:19:39,029 --> 01:19:41,615
Instant Section Eight.

1049
01:19:42,282 --> 01:19:45,702
He was just waiting
for his papers to clear Division.

1050
01:19:48,205 --> 01:19:51,083
You ready? Turn over.

1051
01:19:52,626 --> 01:19:54,920
Hue City interviews, roll 34.

1052
01:19:57,005 --> 01:20:01,009
Well, like- Like you see, you know,
it's a major city...

1053
01:20:01,176 --> 01:20:04,721
...so we have to assault with tanks,
we roll in the streets.

1054
01:20:04,888 --> 01:20:07,307
So they send us in first to squat...

1055
01:20:07,474 --> 01:20:11,186
...make sure that there are no little...

1056
01:20:12,354 --> 01:20:15,566
No Vietnamese waiting with B-40 rockets
to blow the tanks away.

1057
01:20:15,732 --> 01:20:18,235
So we clear it out
and we roll the tanks in...

1058
01:20:18,402 --> 01:20:20,737
...and basically blow the place to hell.

1059
01:20:21,363 --> 01:20:24,950
When we're in Hue,
when we're in Hue City...

1060
01:20:25,117 --> 01:20:27,077
...it's like a war, you know...

1061
01:20:27,244 --> 01:20:29,163
...Iike what- What-

1062
01:20:29,329 --> 01:20:32,332
What I thought about a war,
what I thought a war was-

1063
01:20:32,499 --> 01:20:35,002
You know, was supposed to be.

1064
01:20:36,170 --> 01:20:38,380
There's the enemy, you kill them.

1065
01:20:38,964 --> 01:20:42,092
I don't think there's any question about it.
I mean, we're the best.

1066
01:20:42,259 --> 01:20:44,386
I mean, all that bullshit
about the Air Cav...

1067
01:20:44,595 --> 01:20:46,722
When the shit hits the fan,
who do they call?

1068
01:20:46,889 --> 01:20:50,225
They call Mother Green
and her killing machine.

1069
01:20:50,392 --> 01:20:53,395
Do I think America belongs in Vietnam?

1070
01:20:54,062 --> 01:20:57,983
I don't know.
I belong in Vietnam, I'll tell you that.

1071
01:20:58,150 --> 01:21:00,402
Can I quote LBJ?

1072
01:21:01,945 --> 01:21:05,407
" I will not send American boys...

1073
01:21:05,616 --> 01:21:07,868
...8 or 10,000 miles
around the world...

1074
01:21:08,035 --> 01:21:12,247
...to do a job that Asian boys
ought to be doing for themselves."

1075
01:21:14,124 --> 01:21:18,462
Personally think they don't really
want to be involved in this war...

1076
01:21:18,629 --> 01:21:22,424
...you know, I mean, like they-
It's sort of like...

1077
01:21:22,966 --> 01:21:26,345
...they took away our freedom
and gave it to the gookers, you know.

1078
01:21:26,512 --> 01:21:28,096
But they don't want it.

1079
01:21:28,263 --> 01:21:30,682
They'd rather be alive than free, I guess,
you know.

1080
01:21:30,849 --> 01:21:32,851
Poor, dumb bastards.

1081
01:21:33,727 --> 01:21:38,482
Well, the ones I'm fighting at
are some pretty- Pretty bad boys.

1082
01:21:38,649 --> 01:21:40,400
I'm not real...

1083
01:21:41,568 --> 01:21:44,404
I'm not real keen
on some of these fellas...

1084
01:21:44,571 --> 01:21:47,991
...that are supposedly on our side.

1085
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:50,994
I keep meeting them
coming the other way.

1086
01:21:53,080 --> 01:21:54,122
Yeah.

1087
01:21:54,706 --> 01:21:56,875
I mean, we're getting killed
for these people...

1088
01:21:57,042 --> 01:21:59,211
...and they don't even appreciate it.

1089
01:21:59,878 --> 01:22:01,797
They think it's a big joke.

1090
01:22:02,464 --> 01:22:04,466
Well, if you ask me...

1091
01:22:04,925 --> 01:22:06,969
...we're shooting the wrong gooks.

1092
01:22:07,427 --> 01:22:10,973
Well, it depends on the situation.
I mean, I'm here to take combat photos.

1093
01:22:11,140 --> 01:22:14,685
But if the shit gets too thick,
I mean, I'll go to the rifle.

1094
01:22:15,727 --> 01:22:18,480
What do I think about
America's involvement in the war?

1095
01:22:18,647 --> 01:22:20,399
Well, I think we should win.

1096
01:22:21,066 --> 01:22:23,026
I hate Vietnam.

1097
01:22:23,235 --> 01:22:25,237
There's not one horse
in this whole country.

1098
01:22:25,404 --> 01:22:27,531
They don't have one horse in Vietnam.

1099
01:22:27,739 --> 01:22:30,325
There's something
basically wrong with that.

1100
01:22:31,743 --> 01:22:33,662
Well, if they'd send us
more guys, maybe...

1101
01:22:33,871 --> 01:22:37,875
...and bomb the hell out of the North,
they might give up.

1102
01:22:38,667 --> 01:22:44,214
I wanted to see exotic Vietnam,
the jewel of Southeast Asia.

1103
01:22:44,798 --> 01:22:49,178
I wanted to meet interesting and
stimulating people of an ancient culture...

1104
01:22:49,344 --> 01:22:50,637
...and kill them.

1105
01:22:51,096 --> 01:22:55,893
I wanted to be the first kid on my block
to get a confirmed kill.

1106
01:23:14,620 --> 01:23:16,747
Ten-hut.

1107
01:23:18,582 --> 01:23:20,083
- All right.
- My, oh, my.

1108
01:23:20,292 --> 01:23:23,170
- Good morning, little schoolgirl.
- Look at this lady.

1109
01:23:23,337 --> 01:23:25,422
I'm a little schoolboy too.

1110
01:23:25,839 --> 01:23:27,132
My, my, my.

1111
01:23:27,674 --> 01:23:30,969
- What you got there, chief?
- Do you want number one fucky?

1112
01:23:32,179 --> 01:23:34,973
Hey, any of you boys
want number one fucky?

1113
01:23:35,182 --> 01:23:37,559
I'm so horny,
I can't even get a piece of hand.

1114
01:23:37,726 --> 01:23:40,938
- Me want sucky.
- Sucky, fucky, smoke cigarette in her pussy.

1115
01:23:41,104 --> 01:23:43,649
She give you everything you want,
long time.

1116
01:23:43,857 --> 01:23:47,778
Everything you want.
Hey, how much there, chief?

1117
01:23:47,986 --> 01:23:50,239
- Fifteen dollars each.
- No.

1118
01:23:52,574 --> 01:23:55,244
Fifteen dollar beaucoup money.

1119
01:23:55,410 --> 01:23:56,662
Five dollar each.

1120
01:23:56,870 --> 01:23:58,664
Come on, she love you good.

1121
01:23:58,831 --> 01:24:00,332
Boom-boom long time.

1122
01:24:00,541 --> 01:24:02,209
- Ten dollars.
- Five dollars.

1123
01:24:02,376 --> 01:24:03,877
No. Ten dollars.

1124
01:24:04,044 --> 01:24:06,213
Be glad to trade you some ARVlN rifles.

1125
01:24:06,380 --> 01:24:09,216
Ain't never been fired
and only dropped once.

1126
01:24:10,134 --> 01:24:11,885
Okay, $5. You give me.

1127
01:24:12,052 --> 01:24:14,388
- Okay, okay.
- All right.

1128
01:24:15,681 --> 01:24:17,057
Let's get mounted.

1129
01:24:22,437 --> 01:24:24,022
Something wrong there, chief?

1130
01:24:24,189 --> 01:24:26,150
She says no boom-boom
with soul brother.

1131
01:24:26,316 --> 01:24:27,860
What the motherfuck?

1132
01:24:28,068 --> 01:24:30,571
She says soul brother too beaucoup,
too beaucoup.

1133
01:24:30,737 --> 01:24:32,072
What is this, man?

1134
01:24:32,239 --> 01:24:37,327
I think what he's trying to tell you
is you black boys pack too much meat.

1135
01:24:38,328 --> 01:24:41,039
Too beaucoup, too beaucoup.

1136
01:24:41,206 --> 01:24:42,875
Oh, shit.

1137
01:24:43,041 --> 01:24:46,712
This baby-san looks like she could
suck the chrome off a trailer hitch.

1138
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:49,965
She say too beaucoup, too beaucoup.

1139
01:24:50,132 --> 01:24:52,050
Excuse me, ma'am.

1140
01:24:52,759 --> 01:24:54,761
What we have here, little yellow sister...

1141
01:24:54,928 --> 01:24:59,391
...is a magnificent specimen
of pure Alabama blacksnake.

1142
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:02,144
But it ain't too goddamn beaucoup.

1143
01:25:03,187 --> 01:25:05,105
Okay, okay.

1144
01:25:05,814 --> 01:25:07,774
Okay, okay.

1145
01:25:09,151 --> 01:25:11,403
All right. Yeah. This is my boogie.

1146
01:25:11,570 --> 01:25:13,780
- Hey, we need a batting order.
- I'm going first.

1147
01:25:13,947 --> 01:25:17,326
Back off, white bread.
Don't get between a dog and his meat.

1148
01:25:17,493 --> 01:25:20,787
All fucking niggers must fucking hang.

1149
01:25:20,996 --> 01:25:24,124
- Hey, Animal, man.
- You son of a-

1150
01:25:24,291 --> 01:25:28,420
Hey, hey, I won't be long.
I'll skip the foreplay.

1151
01:25:28,587 --> 01:25:30,881
- I don't want it after you, man.
- Fuck you.

1152
01:26:04,081 --> 01:26:06,375
Intelligence passed the word down...

1153
01:26:06,542 --> 01:26:10,128
...that during the night
the NVA had pulled out of our area...

1154
01:26:10,295 --> 01:26:13,257
...to positions across the Perfume River.

1155
01:26:13,423 --> 01:26:17,845
Our squad is sent on patrol
to check out the report.

1156
01:26:49,293 --> 01:26:52,087
Face outboard and take cover. Do it.

1157
01:27:05,559 --> 01:27:07,060
Shit.

1158
01:27:15,652 --> 01:27:17,571
He ain't gonna make it.

1159
01:27:20,491 --> 01:27:22,117
Shit.

1160
01:27:28,624 --> 01:27:31,877
Hotel One Actual, this is Cowboy.

1161
01:27:33,337 --> 01:27:36,799
Hotel One Actual, this is Cowboy.

1162
01:27:37,674 --> 01:27:39,176
Hotel One. Over.

1163
01:27:39,343 --> 01:27:41,386
Murph, this is Cowboy.

1164
01:27:41,553 --> 01:27:44,890
Crazy's hit. Booby trap.

1165
01:27:46,099 --> 01:27:47,810
Wait, One.

1166
01:27:48,977 --> 01:27:53,440
Okay. You're senior NCO, Cowboy.
You're in charge.

1167
01:27:53,732 --> 01:27:55,317
- Continue with the patrol...
- Shit.

1168
01:27:55,526 --> 01:27:57,820
-...and call in at the next checkpoint.
- Shit.

1169
01:27:57,986 --> 01:28:00,697
Roger. Out.

1170
01:28:07,120 --> 01:28:08,997
I ' m squad leader.

1171
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,378
Follow you anywhere, scumbag.

1172
01:28:15,504 --> 01:28:17,047
All right.

1173
01:28:17,881 --> 01:28:19,424
He's dead.

1174
01:29:00,549 --> 01:29:02,092
Cowboy.

1175
01:29:08,891 --> 01:29:10,142
What's up?

1176
01:29:10,434 --> 01:29:13,645
I think we made a mistake
at the last checkpoint.

1177
01:29:13,812 --> 01:29:16,231
Here, see what you think.

1178
01:29:18,317 --> 01:29:21,361
I think we're here...

1179
01:29:21,904 --> 01:29:24,823
...and we should be here.

1180
01:29:26,450 --> 01:29:28,577
- We're here?
- Yeah.

1181
01:29:28,744 --> 01:29:31,997
- We should be here?
- Yeah. Yeah, that's right.

1182
01:29:38,170 --> 01:29:39,880
Fuck.

1183
01:29:45,219 --> 01:29:46,845
What do you think?

1184
01:29:48,514 --> 01:29:51,266
Well, I think we should change direction.

1185
01:30:05,197 --> 01:30:06,782
Okay.

1186
01:30:07,407 --> 01:30:09,451
We'll change direction.

1187
01:30:20,087 --> 01:30:21,672
What's up?

1188
01:30:21,839 --> 01:30:23,757
Changing direction.

1189
01:30:24,466 --> 01:30:25,717
What are we, lost?

1190
01:30:25,884 --> 01:30:28,971
Joker, shut the fuck up.

1191
01:30:29,263 --> 01:30:31,390
Okay, listen up.

1192
01:30:31,598 --> 01:30:33,684
- Can you hear me?
- Yeah.

1193
01:30:33,851 --> 01:30:35,686
Okay, we're changing direction.

1194
01:30:35,853 --> 01:30:37,563
We're heading over that way.

1195
01:30:37,771 --> 01:30:40,941
Eightball's gonna go over there
and see can he find a way through.

1196
01:30:41,441 --> 01:30:43,861
- Got it?
- Got it.

1197
01:30:44,570 --> 01:30:47,573
Eightball, let's dance.

1198
01:30:48,115 --> 01:30:50,409
Put a nigger behind the trigger.

1199
01:31:51,512 --> 01:31:53,055
Fuck.

1200
01:32:08,779 --> 01:32:10,197
Cease fire.

1201
01:32:10,364 --> 01:32:12,241
Cease fire, goddamn it.

1202
01:32:12,407 --> 01:32:14,952
Cool it, goddamn it. Cool it. Cease fire.

1203
01:32:15,118 --> 01:32:16,662
- Hold it.
- Cease fire.

1204
01:32:16,829 --> 01:32:18,038
- Cease fire.
- Cease fire.

1205
01:32:18,247 --> 01:32:21,750
Okay, listen up. Did anybody see a sniper?
Did anybody see anything?

1206
01:32:21,917 --> 01:32:23,585
Anybody see a sniper?

1207
01:32:23,752 --> 01:32:25,254
- Nothing.
- Negative.

1208
01:32:25,420 --> 01:32:29,341
Okay, then save your ammo.
Nobody fire till I tell you.

1209
01:32:30,259 --> 01:32:31,426
Eightball.

1210
01:32:31,593 --> 01:32:34,221
No, no. Cease fire. Cease fire.

1211
01:32:34,388 --> 01:32:36,056
Animal, cease fire.

1212
01:32:36,265 --> 01:32:38,392
Cowboy, it's Sergeant Murphy.

1213
01:32:38,559 --> 01:32:40,060
This is Cowboy. Over.

1214
01:32:40,185 --> 01:32:43,647
This is Murphy.
What is your present position? Over.

1215
01:32:43,814 --> 01:32:46,108
Murph, we're receiving enemy sniper fire.

1216
01:32:46,275 --> 01:32:47,568
Eightball is down.

1217
01:32:47,734 --> 01:32:50,612
Our position is about half a klick
north of Checkpoint Four.

1218
01:32:50,779 --> 01:32:54,491
Believe possible strong enemy forces
occupying buildings in front of us.

1219
01:32:54,658 --> 01:32:58,162
Request immediate tank support. Over.

1220
01:32:58,662 --> 01:33:00,080
Roger. Understand.

1221
01:33:00,247 --> 01:33:02,749
I'll see what I can do. Over.

1222
01:33:02,916 --> 01:33:05,294
Roger. Over and out.

1223
01:33:05,460 --> 01:33:07,754
- Stay close.
- Got it.

1224
01:33:08,380 --> 01:33:12,426
Okay, listen up.
I think we're being set up for an ambush.

1225
01:33:12,593 --> 01:33:16,138
I think there may be strong enemy forces
in those buildings over there.

1226
01:33:16,305 --> 01:33:18,182
I've requested tank support.

1227
01:33:18,348 --> 01:33:21,643
We're gonna sit tight till it comes,
but keep your eyes open.

1228
01:33:21,810 --> 01:33:25,814
If they decide to hit us,
we'll have to pull back fast.

1229
01:33:26,857 --> 01:33:29,610
Goddamn it. Halt.
Cease your fire, Mother.

1230
01:33:29,776 --> 01:33:31,653
- Cease your fucking fire.
- Cowboy.

1231
01:33:31,862 --> 01:33:33,614
- What?
- We can't leave him out there.

1232
01:33:33,780 --> 01:33:36,533
We're not leaving him,
we'll get him when the tank comes up.

1233
01:33:36,700 --> 01:33:39,369
He's hit three fucking times.
He can't wait that long.

1234
01:33:39,536 --> 01:33:41,580
I seen this before.

1235
01:33:41,747 --> 01:33:45,000
That sniper's just trying to suck us in,
one at a time.

1236
01:33:46,877 --> 01:33:50,005
Goddamn it. No.

1237
01:33:50,214 --> 01:33:53,133
- Goddamn it, cease fire. Cease fire.
- Man, fuck this-

1238
01:33:53,300 --> 01:33:55,385
Fuck this shit.
I'm going in to bring him out.

1239
01:33:55,552 --> 01:33:59,139
- No, you sit the fuck down, goddamn it.
- Cover me.

1240
01:34:15,072 --> 01:34:19,535
Cease fire, he's there.
Cease fire, he's there.

1241
01:34:19,743 --> 01:34:21,995
Cease fire.

1242
01:34:33,382 --> 01:34:34,675
Hold your fire.

1243
01:34:34,842 --> 01:34:36,885
Hold your fire.

1244
01:34:37,052 --> 01:34:39,555
Cease fire, you can't see the sniper.

1245
01:34:39,721 --> 01:34:44,059
Save the ammo.
Nobody fire till I tell you. Nobody.

1246
01:34:49,523 --> 01:34:51,316
Hold your fire.

1247
01:34:52,025 --> 01:34:54,528
What the fuck do we do now, Cowboy?

1248
01:34:55,779 --> 01:34:57,739
Give me that fucking radio.

1249
01:35:01,952 --> 01:35:04,580
Murph? This is Cowboy. Over.

1250
01:35:04,746 --> 01:35:06,248
This is Murphy. Over.

1251
01:35:06,373 --> 01:35:08,750
Murph, we're in some deep shit.
I got two men down.

1252
01:35:08,959 --> 01:35:11,837
What's the story
on that fucking tank? Over.

1253
01:35:12,921 --> 01:35:16,383
Sorry, Cowboy.
No luck so far with the tank.

1254
01:35:16,550 --> 01:35:18,802
Will advise. Over.

1255
01:35:19,845 --> 01:35:21,763
Roger. Out.

1256
01:35:22,181 --> 01:35:24,475
Numb-nut bastards.

1257
01:35:24,683 --> 01:35:27,769
- Okay, listen up.
- Listen up.

1258
01:35:28,645 --> 01:35:30,689
Can't afford to wait for the tank.

1259
01:35:30,856 --> 01:35:32,774
I think they're gonna hit us any minute.

1260
01:35:32,983 --> 01:35:35,152
When they do,
we won't have time to pull out.

1261
01:35:35,360 --> 01:35:38,280
We gotta do it now.
Let's get ready to move.

1262
01:35:38,489 --> 01:35:40,741
- Ready to pull out.
- Wait a minute. Hold it.

1263
01:35:41,158 --> 01:35:44,953
Hold it, nobody's pulling out.
There's only one sniper there.

1264
01:35:45,120 --> 01:35:46,371
Back off, Mother.

1265
01:35:46,538 --> 01:35:49,500
I'm calling the plays.
I say we're pulling out.

1266
01:35:49,708 --> 01:35:51,502
Well, what about Doc Jay and Eightball?

1267
01:35:51,668 --> 01:35:55,464
I know it's a shitty thing to do,
but we can't refuse to accept the situation.

1268
01:35:55,631 --> 01:35:57,883
We're not leaving
Doc Jay and Eightball out there.

1269
01:35:58,050 --> 01:35:59,885
Doc Jay and Eightball are wasted.

1270
01:36:00,052 --> 01:36:02,805
- You know that.
- Bullshit. Come on, you guys.

1271
01:36:02,971 --> 01:36:05,474
We gotta bring them back.
Let's get them, let's do it.

1272
01:36:05,599 --> 01:36:07,976
Stand down, Mother.
That's a direct order.

1273
01:36:12,189 --> 01:36:16,318
Fuck you, Cowboy.
Fuck all you assholes.

1274
01:36:18,403 --> 01:36:21,448
- Goddamn it.
- Fucking son of a bitch.

1275
01:36:21,615 --> 01:36:24,326
You motherfucker.

1276
01:36:39,967 --> 01:36:42,719
Doc. Doc. Doc.

1277
01:36:44,555 --> 01:36:46,473
Where's the sniper?

1278
01:36:49,434 --> 01:36:52,604
Doc, where's the sniper?

1279
01:37:01,321 --> 01:37:03,073
Shit.

1280
01:37:04,658 --> 01:37:07,202
Shit. Fuck.

1281
01:37:21,508 --> 01:37:23,135
Fuck.

1282
01:37:54,791 --> 01:37:56,919
Hey, Cowboy.

1283
01:37:57,252 --> 01:37:59,004
Yeah?

1284
01:37:59,880 --> 01:38:03,383
Doc Jay and Eightball are wasted.

1285
01:38:04,009 --> 01:38:07,513
There's only one sniper, nothing else.

1286
01:38:07,888 --> 01:38:11,725
Move up the squad,
you're clear up to here.

1287
01:38:12,559 --> 01:38:14,061
Come on.

1288
01:38:16,688 --> 01:38:18,899
Son of a bitch.

1289
01:38:22,653 --> 01:38:25,197
- Okay, listen up.
- Listen up.

1290
01:38:26,240 --> 01:38:30,494
No-Doze, Stutten, Donlon, Rock,
you come with me, we'll take a look.

1291
01:38:30,911 --> 01:38:33,330
The rest of you all stay put
and cover our ass.

1292
01:38:33,497 --> 01:38:36,291
We may be coming back in a big hurry.

1293
01:38:37,167 --> 01:38:39,503
- I'm going with you.
- I'm coming too.

1294
01:38:39,670 --> 01:38:41,505
Okay.

1295
01:38:41,672 --> 01:38:43,340
- You all set?
- Yeah.

1296
01:38:43,507 --> 01:38:44,550
Let's move out.

1297
01:38:44,925 --> 01:38:45,968
Let's do it.

1298
01:39:24,173 --> 01:39:25,507
Hey, Cowboy.

1299
01:39:25,674 --> 01:39:28,177
Top of the black building,
around the corner.

1300
01:39:47,946 --> 01:39:50,657
Donlon, give me that radio.

1301
01:39:53,202 --> 01:39:54,912
Murphy, this is Cowboy. Over.

1302
01:40:05,422 --> 01:40:07,841
- Cowboy.
- Holy shit. That sniper's got a clean shot.

1303
01:40:08,008 --> 01:40:09,885
Get him the fuck out of here.

1304
01:40:16,600 --> 01:40:19,311
- I ain't got a first aid.
- I don't believe this shit.

1305
01:40:19,478 --> 01:40:21,605
- Give me your hand.
- Shut up.

1306
01:40:21,772 --> 01:40:23,357
- Take it easy, Cowboy.
- Don't move.

1307
01:40:23,565 --> 01:40:24,858
- Shit.
- That son of a bitch.

1308
01:40:25,025 --> 01:40:26,902
- You'll be all right.
- You're going home.

1309
01:40:27,069 --> 01:40:29,905
- Shut up.
- Don't shit me.

1310
01:40:30,072 --> 01:40:33,700
You know I'm not gonna shit you, man.
You're my favorite turd.

1311
01:40:34,326 --> 01:40:35,536
Come on. Easy.

1312
01:40:35,953 --> 01:40:37,079
Here you go.

1313
01:40:38,789 --> 01:40:42,668
- Cowboy.
- Hang on, man. Hang on.

1314
01:40:46,505 --> 01:40:49,550
I can hack it. I can hack it.

1315
01:40:55,639 --> 01:40:59,059
- I can hack it.
- You can hack it, man.

1316
01:41:55,115 --> 01:41:57,659
Let's go get some payback.

1317
01:42:03,582 --> 01:42:05,167
Okay.

1318
01:42:11,340 --> 01:42:13,050
Okay.

1319
01:42:20,516 --> 01:42:22,601
Watch that fucking hole.

1320
01:42:23,894 --> 01:42:25,103
Throw some smoke.

1321
01:42:41,620 --> 01:42:43,413
Okay, ready?

1322
01:43:24,454 --> 01:43:28,167
Donlon, Rock, that way.
You two, with me.

1323
01:43:33,255 --> 01:43:35,924
Joker, in there. New guy.

1324
01:45:39,923 --> 01:45:42,843
We got the sniper.

1325
01:46:16,585 --> 01:46:18,086
Joker?

1326
01:46:18,629 --> 01:46:20,130
Yo.

1327
01:46:20,464 --> 01:46:22,049
What's up?

1328
01:46:23,509 --> 01:46:25,677
We got the sniper.

1329
01:46:38,232 --> 01:46:40,192
I saved Joker's ass.

1330
01:46:40,359 --> 01:46:42,152
I got the sniper.

1331
01:46:42,319 --> 01:46:44,988
I fucking blew her away.

1332
01:46:45,823 --> 01:46:47,783
Am I bad?

1333
01:46:48,408 --> 01:46:52,412
Am I a life-taker? Am I a heartbreaker?

1334
01:47:09,972 --> 01:47:12,141
What's she saying?

1335
01:47:15,769 --> 01:47:17,604
She's praying.

1336
01:47:21,483 --> 01:47:24,778
No more boom-boom for this baby-san.

1337
01:47:27,698 --> 01:47:30,117
There's nothing we can do for her.

1338
01:47:31,702 --> 01:47:33,787
She's dead meat.

1339
01:47:38,250 --> 01:47:39,710
Okay.

1340
01:47:41,003 --> 01:47:43,172
Let's get the fuck out of here.

1341
01:47:47,676 --> 01:47:49,553
What about her?

1342
01:47:53,307 --> 01:47:54,975
Fuck her.

1343
01:47:56,310 --> 01:47:58,020
Let her rot.

1344
01:48:14,328 --> 01:48:16,663
We can't just leave her here.

1345
01:48:19,875 --> 01:48:21,752
Hey, asshole.

1346
01:48:22,252 --> 01:48:24,463
Cowboy's wasted.

1347
01:48:24,922 --> 01:48:27,508
You're fresh out of friends.

1348
01:48:28,592 --> 01:48:30,427
I'm running this squad now...

1349
01:48:30,594 --> 01:48:34,890
...and I say we leave the gook
for the mother-loving rats.

1350
01:48:38,727 --> 01:48:41,772
I'm not trying to run this squad.

1351
01:48:43,607 --> 01:48:47,569
I'm just saying
we can't leave her like this.

1352
01:48:57,120 --> 01:49:00,082
Shoot me.

1353
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,044
Shoot...

1354
01:49:04,545 --> 01:49:06,130
...me.

1355
01:49:06,713 --> 01:49:08,799
Shoot...

1356
01:49:09,341 --> 01:49:10,926
...me.

1357
01:49:11,385 --> 01:49:13,387
Shoot.

1358
01:49:15,055 --> 01:49:16,765
Shoot.

1359
01:49:17,975 --> 01:49:21,270
If you wanna waste her, go on...

1360
01:49:23,147 --> 01:49:25,232
...waste her.

1361
01:49:25,399 --> 01:49:27,025
Shoot...

1362
01:49:29,194 --> 01:49:30,654
...me.

1363
01:49:34,741 --> 01:49:37,494
Shoot me.

1364
01:49:39,455 --> 01:49:40,664
Shoot...

1365
01:49:41,957 --> 01:49:43,667
...me.

1366
01:49:44,042 --> 01:49:46,170
Shoot...

1367
01:49:46,879 --> 01:49:48,297
...me.

1368
01:49:48,881 --> 01:49:51,091
Shoot.

1369
01:49:52,718 --> 01:49:54,761
Shoot.

1370
01:49:58,390 --> 01:49:59,933
Shoot.

1371
01:50:00,934 --> 01:50:02,519
Shoot.

1372
01:50:39,848 --> 01:50:41,683
Joker...

1373
01:50:41,850 --> 01:50:46,605
...we're gonna have to put you up
for the Congressional Medal of Ugly.

1374
01:50:50,400 --> 01:50:52,528
Hard-core, man.

1375
01:50:54,530 --> 01:50:57,074
Fucking hard-core.

1376
01:51:14,049 --> 01:51:19,138
We have nailed our names
in the pages of history enough for today.

1377
01:51:19,721 --> 01:51:24,393
We hump down to the Perfume River
to set in for the night.

1378
01:52:02,931 --> 01:52:07,144
My thoughts drift back
to erect-nipple wet dreams...

1379
01:52:07,311 --> 01:52:13,442
...about Mary Jane Rottencrotch
and the great homecoming-fuck fantasy.

1380
01:52:14,109 --> 01:52:16,778
I am so happy that I am alive...

1381
01:52:16,945 --> 01:52:20,491
...in one piece and short.

1382
01:52:21,158 --> 01:52:24,453
I am in a world of shit, yes...

1383
01:52:24,620 --> 01:52:26,580
...but I am alive.

1384
01:52:26,997 --> 01:52:28,999
And I am not afraid.
